Chapter 3425 Dragon Soul Roar

The Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s eighth prince roared. The good fortune that had originally been theirs had been snatched away by Long Chen. So, how could he not be enraged?

As his Blood Qi soared, ripples appeared and astral winds raged. A heaven-shattering fist then smashed toward Long Chen.

“Ignorant fool, today is the day of your death. No one within the nine heavens and ten lands can save you.” Long Chen’s suppressed anger instantly ignited. Upon thinking of the nine star heir, his heart felt like it was being bitten by vipers.

The nine star heir had had his Violet Tower Star crippled, so he had accepted his death. No matter how great Long Chen’s abilities were, there was no way he could save someone who wanted to die.

Although Long Chen knew that the nine star heir would have died in any case, he still could not forgive the eighth prince. He didn’t care.

“DIE!”

Long Chen and the eighth prince roared at the same time. Their killing intent caused the world to change color. Both their eyes were scarlet.

BOOM! Their fists collided like two stars. As a result, the void was shattered and the sun and moon turned dim. Even spacetime was twisted.

After that collision, both of them were knocked back and took nine steps back, every step causing the ground beneath their feet to collapse. The land was instantly ruined.

The other experts were directly blown back by the shockwaves of their power. They were all stunned, unable to imagine how a human was able to compete with the physical body of the eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. Moreover, Long Chen wasn’t inferior at all.

It had to be known that the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s greatest pride, the thing that allowed them to stand at the peak of the Integral Heaven Star-Field, was their immense, monstrous power. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

It wasn’t just the experts within the Divine Lord Immortal Realm that were shocked. Even the spectating experts outside were flabbergasted.

Every single one of them was profoundly aware of just how powerful the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s bodies were. Now, a human actually managed to fight evenly against the eighth prince, relying purely on the power of his physical body. This was unbelievable.

“Not too bad. But it means nothing. He will still die,” declared the leader of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race after recovering from his shock.

Inside the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, Lei Yuner almost cried out in delight when she saw Long Chen able to fight the eighth prince evenly. Long Chen was even stronger than she had anticipated, so she grew even prouder of her vision and choice.

“I didn’t expect that an ant like you would possess such power. That is beyond my expectations. However, it doesn’t matter. You are still an ant in front of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race.”

After that, the eighth prince spread his arms, and the space behind him collapsed. A giant elephant then came out of that collapsed space. It was as if it had come from ancient times. A desolate aura exuded out of it.

The eighth prince had summoned his manifestation. When his manifestation appeared, an elephant’s cry shook the world, collapsing mountains and quivering the earth.

In that instant, the eighth prince’s aura rose by multiple times. Standing in the air, he looked down on Long Chen like a king looking at a peasant.

“Human ant, are you prepared to die?” shouted the eighth prince.

Suddenly, space shuddered and Lei Yuner appeared beside Long Chen, lightning circulating around her entire body.

“Don’t worry, I’ll fight with you. We can definitely win.” Afraid that Long Chen wouldn’t be able to handle the eighth prince alone, Lei Yuner came to his aid.

“Little slut of the Lightning Falcon race, your opponent is me. You aren’t qualified to stop the eighth prince from killing whoever he wants.” Wu Ying sneered at Lei Yuner.

“Little duck, who is afraid of you? In a bit, I’ll use my new trump card to kill you!” shouted Lei Yuner.

However, Long Chen shoved Lei Yuner suddenly. With a grunt, Lei Yuner was sent flying into the distance.

Just as Lei Yuner felt lost, Long Chen’s voice rang out in her mind. “Yuner, I’m going to start fighting for real now. It would be best if you don’t get close to me, or you might get caught up in it. I know you want to help, but I just want to tell you that the greatest help you can give me is to protect yourself, understand?”

Lei Yuner didn’t understand. But she obediently nodded and retreated further.

Seeing that, Wu Ying smiled with a very pleased expression. She considered this as Lei Yuner fleeing from her threat.

“Are you ready? I’m going to attack. Currently, I am on the verge of making my breakthrough. If I advance to the Divine Lord realm and the Four Peaks merge, the power of my physical body will instantly soar a hundred times. Furthermore, I have the blessing of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s heroic spirits. I will awaken our ancient divine abilities. At that time, killing you would be meaningless. To die by my hands is an honor for you, as you will have the same fate as a nine star heir. You should thank me,” sneered the eighth prince.

“Fuck off!” Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s head buzzed and his anger exploded.

After that, a golden pillar of light soared into the sky, and 108,000 scales appeared on Long Chen’s body. A terrifying dragon might then crashed down.

A majestic dragon roar resounded through the air, containing boundless killing intent and a desire to slaughter the entire world.

The Golden Dragon Battle Armor was not summoned by Long Chen this time. It had automatically appeared. When the pressure of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race tried to lock onto Long Chen, his dragon blood was provoked. So, the instant Long Chen couldn’t control himself any longer, it appeared.

Long Chen seemed to have put on a set of golden battle armor, and each of his scales had a golden dragon flowing across it. It looked like the dragons were about to charge out of the bindings of the scales and directly eliminate the eighth prince.

“Dragon soul!”

The demonic beasts outside the Divine Lord Immortal Realm jumped in shock when they saw that.

In the immortal world, dragon blood, dragon scales, dragon bones, and dragon teeth were all treasures. Although they were precious, they were obtainable.

However, a dragon soul could not be obtained. A dragon soul referred to when a true dragon died and its soul essence didn’t disperse, but instead condensed within a part of its body. Normally, that part of the body was the reverse scale.

But if someone were to extract the essence blood inside the reverse scale, the dragon soul would have nothing to keep it going and would naturally disperse. Because of it, only an expert that had inherited the will of the true dragon could possibly obtain the dragon soul.

The dragon race was prideful, especially the true dragon race. There were no records of a dragon soul accompanying someone else. It was only a legend. Hence, they hadn’t expected to see it here, in the body of a human.

“Hahaha, I didn’t expect that you actually have true dragon essence blood! It’s mine!”

The eighth prince laughed delightedly as his greed was sparked. True dragon essence blood was a priceless treasure to any race.

“Do you think you’ll have the life to take it?”

Long Chen’s killing intent was overflowing. With a single step, he was like a bolt of lightning shooting toward the eighth prince, smashing his foot toward him.
