Chapter 4546 Entering the Battle Zone

When Long Chen saw those devil experts, his pupils shrank. What a terrifying force. They outnumbered the mixed beast race ten to one. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

What shocked him the most was that among them were three existences with auras on par with Yan Baichen’s.

These devil experts differed from any Long Chen had encountered before. Towering in stature, they had bull horns atop their heads, and he could see flickering flames around them.

“It’s the flame devil race, one of the largest and most powerful races in the world of the ninth heaven. But don’t worry, I’m stronger now. I have the power to protect you,” reassured Feng You upon seeing Long Chen’s reaction.

Long Chen had retreated behind her, and she just smiled warmly. She thought that protecting Long Chen was her greatest responsibility now.

Little did she know that he was hiding because he had slain too many experts of the devil race. Whether it was on the Martial Heaven Continent or the immortal world, he had slaughtered countless devils, so he was worried about them detecting him and implicating the mixed beast race.

Feng You’s words made him not know whether to laugh or cry, and he also felt a sense of warmth. The feeling of being protected was truly moving.

What amused him the most was that both Feng You and the rest of the mixed beast race thought that he only had some rather odd techniques and wasn’t actually that strong.

“Feng You, if we keep going forward, will we run into more outsiders from my world?” asked Long Chen.

Feng You shook her head. “It’s unlikely. The paths for the Void Spirit World and the Fantasy Spirit World are different. It’s rare to encounter outsiders on this path as they have their own path. Only at the entrance to both worlds will we run into each other, and a bloody battle will erupt then. It is said that when these two worlds open, rivers of blood will flow. In that battle, you have to protect yourself. I will be targeted and might not be able to protect you.”

Feng You’s expression was serious. Every time the two worlds opened, there would be an immense battle.

The native and the foreign experts were like fire and water. At the same time, some factions would join forces with those foreign experts to slaughter their enemies.

After all, some powerful races didn’t reject the outsiders and were willing to form alliances with them. As long as the relationship was mutually beneficial, they would accept it.

Hearing this, Long Chen smiled. Once his status was exposed, he would probably be the main target.

After all, Long Chen had enemies all over the world. Once he and Feng You reached the entrance to both worlds, all his enemies would just assault him.

Even when he knew about the possibility, he didn’t feel any fear, and his blood slowly heated up instead. Now that he had a suitable weapon and could fully unleash his astral energy, he wasn’t afraid of anyone.

Up ahead, the devil race’s army was marching forward with their overwhelming devil qi. The mixed beast race’s people slowed down to let them pass by first.

Although Feng You’s power had grown to the point that she didn’t even fear the three existences on par with Yan Baichen, that didn’t mean she could do whatever she wanted. If both sides really did clash, she would be able to kill her way out, but the rest of her people would probably die.

Feng You instantly drew the devil race’s attention. Standing at the very front, she gazed at them coldly and didn’t bother hiding her aura.

The three leaders of the devil race stared back at her, a hint of fear evident in their eyes. They chose to not provoke her and just continue onward.

As fellow peak experts, the trio knew that Feng You wasn’t a pushover. If they were to antagonize her, while they could annihilate her subordinates, her counterattack would definitely slay most of their people as well.

Most importantly, her aura exuded heavy pressure on them, so they didn’t dare to do anything to her lightly.

Because of this, they didn’t even look at Long Chen, which startled him but made him feel relieved as well.

“Interesting. They actually can’t sense the resentment of their kin within me.”

Actually, it was all thanks to the presence of the Earth Cauldron in Long Chen’s mind-sea. Its existence could neutralize the spiritual enmities of the slain devils within him.

Long Chen wasn’t sure why this happened, but he did know that he could play around now.

Without the need to feel so cautious, he stood together with Feng You, gazing at the devil experts.

The devil experts also looked at him. When they saw him, although they felt like his face needed a beating, they didn’t feel any particular hatred. They simply glared at him in a vain attempt to scare him.

When those looks came out, Long Chen fully relaxed. He then smiled and waved at them warmly. At that time, the devil experts scoffed and didn’t even look at him.

Seeing Long Chen no longer afraid of them, Feng You smiled. She felt extremely protective over him and swore that she wouldn’t let anyone hurt him.

Once the devil race passed by, Feng You continued leading the way, holding Long Chen’s hand happily.

Immediately, Long Chen sensed a sisterly vibe from Feng You, as if she were an elder sister holding a younger brother’s hand. This made him rather uncomfortable, and he wanted to pull his hand away several times. However, Feng You’s pure smile dissuaded him from doing so. Perhaps in Feng You’s heart, this gesture was merely a display of pure joy, devoid of any romantic connotations.

Long Chen smiled mockingly at his own thoughts. Perhaps he had been overthinking it. Feng You was part of the mixed beast race, and she was as pure as a sheet of paper. This situation was just like two children holding hands, not something romantic.

After thinking of that, Long Chen also felt more relaxed and began to crack some jokes that elicited laughter from Feng You.

As they continued onward, they encountered more factions, some of which immediately surrounded the mixed beast race upon seeing them. However, as soon as they laid eyes on Feng You, their expressions completely changed. With a single shout from her, they fled right away.

Those factions had some enmities with the mixed beast race. After all, the mixed beast race had faced so much discrimination and suffering from all sides. If it was up to Feng You, she would have just crushed them with her new power.

However, the race leader had told her to be patient and consider the big picture, as an outstanding leader could not be willful. The number one thing in her heart had to be the lives of her people.

Thus, Feng You endured it. As for the other side, Feng You’s aura scared them away. Just as they thought that they had found a weak target to bully, they realized that they were unable to stomach this tough bone.

Seeing them flee, the mixed beast race’s experts cheered excitedly. They felt like they were venting years of frustration and felt even more worshipful toward Feng You.

Suddenly, they heard explosive sounds in the distance, and Feng You’s expression grew serious.

“Everyone, be on guard. We’re about to enter the battle zone.”
