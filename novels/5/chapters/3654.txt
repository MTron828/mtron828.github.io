Chapter 3643 Brothers Reunite

“Found him!”

Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. The compass quickly pointed in one direction. However, after locking in that direction, the compass suddenly dimmed and became still.

Long Chen quickly rushed off with his flying boat. All of a sudden, he saw countless figures rushing off in the same direction he was heading to.

A sea of people was tightly surrounding one area. There was a giant spatial crack here.

Right now, the spatial crack was slowly healing. But the earth was torn apart and a terrifying energy still hung in the air. It seemed that a large battle had just been fought here.

“As expected of the Bloodkill Hall’s number one genius. He found Xia Chen so quickly.”

“It’s too bad, Xia Chen still managed to get away.”

“However, he coughed up blood just now from the injury. He probably didn’t get far. He’ll be found again quickly, and then all that awaits him is death.”

“That Ji Wuying really is terrifying. We searched for so long without finding a single trace, but he found Xia Chen as soon as he arrived.”

“After all, that’s an assassin. Their noses are sharper than dogs’. It’s nothing to be surprised about.”

When Long Chen arrived, he heard countless people talking about it. Hence, his expression sank and he directly squeezed his way through. Seeing this, some people were irritated by his brashness. They were about to start a fight, but when they saw Long Chen’s gaze, they were so terrified that their curses were swallowed back into their stomachs.

“Passers-by, get out of here. Don’t interfere with our Bloodkill Hall’s matters. We are gathering specimens.”

When Long Chen reached the edge of the battlefield, there were several masked, cloaked people blocking him and anyone else from going any further.

However, Long Chen ignored their warning and directly walked in. One of them glared at him and was about to attack when he saw Long Chen’s face more clearly. At that moment, an expression of terror came across his face.

“You-!”

That expert didn’t even get to move before Long Chen slapped him in the face. His entire head exploded.

Everyone was shocked. Those Bloodkill Hall experts were in the midst of gathering the bloodstains and investigating it for something, so they didn’t expect someone to suddenly barge in and start killing.

Long Chen didn’t give them any chance to react at all. They were killed with one slap after another. In just a moment, the four Bloodkill Hall experts were all slain. The final one was in the midst of fading into the void when Long Chen dragged him out and killed him with a slap as well.

Seeing this scene, everyone was terrified. As Ji Wuying’s trusted aides, those assassins were experts amongst experts, but Long Chen slaughtered them effortlessly. If they didn’t personally see it, they wouldn’t believe it.

In their eyes, Long Chen had slaughtered these experts without any effort at all. But in truth, every single one of his attacks contained immense profundities that they simply could not comprehend even after seeing it.

Long Chen was far too familiar with the Bloodkill Hall’s movement art. He had predicted their movements the moment he appeared, so while it appeared as if those Bloodkill Hall experts were simply waiting to be hit, it was not the case. It simply appeared bizarre to the people.

After killing those four, Long Chen ignored the others. He then touched the fresh blood on the ground.

“He was previously injured. Now, this is injury on top of injury.” Sensing the fluctuations coming from the blood, Long Chen circulated the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art. He quickly sensed the general direction of Xia Chen.

Xia Chen had transported himself away. But due to his injury, the dragon blood aura remained in the air. From it, Long Chen was able to see some clues.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ji Wuying was already chasing after Xia Chen. But his efficiency should be much lower than Long Chen’s. That was why his subordinates were gathering samples here. It was in case he failed to follow the tracks.

Long Chen then put away the flying boat. It was too slow. No longer caring about exposing his status, he rushed off like a bolt of lightning.

“Who was that? How is he so terrifying?” It was only once Long Chen left that people started reacting.

“Heavens, isn’t he that madman who’s been plundering the Soaring Dragon Company? In the Chaotic Star Sea, he slaughtered countless heavenly geniuses! I heard he even defeated Yan Xu’s son! He is the youngest dean in the history of the number one academy of the nine heavens and ten lands, Long Chen!”

Some people recognized Long Chen’s adornment, but they weren’t too sure. In the Chaotic Star Sea, Long Chen had killed an unknown number of heavenly geniuses from various races, along with Yan Xu’s son. Hence, his name had long since spread throughout the large domains.

However, the Violet Flame Heaven was gigantic, so information couldn’t spread that rapidly. After all, the experts of the various regions were more familiar with their homes and the laws of the Heavenly Daos there. They had no need to run around with the human race. As for the human race, they weren’t too friendly with each other anyway.

The main reason Long Chen’s name could reach this place was because of the Soaring Dragon Company. In all the history of the Soaring Dragon Company, he was definitely the first to dare to so openly plunder their treasuries.

Of course, after people recognized him, some of them immediately alerted the Soaring Dragon Company in hopes of obtaining a reward.

At this moment, Long Chen had found Xia Chen’s tracks, so he no longer cared if others recognized him. His goal was to find Xia Chen as quickly as possible.

As space quivered, Long Chen appeared atop a large mountain. It had just crumbled, and there was dust everywhere.

Xia Chen had just been transported here. As for Ji Wuying, he had chased Xia Chen down here. But based on the scars, Xia Chen hadn’t stayed behind. He had undergone a second transportation.

Long Chen continued following the aura. This Ji Wuying was truly terrifying. Even without a compass, even without being able to sense dragon blood, he was relying on some unknown ability to track Xia Chen.

Long Chen chased him down as quickly as he could, while also actively throwing out the compass’s fluctuations in hopes of Xia Chen sensing it.

Finally, on the fourth transportation, Long Chen’s compass reacted. Long Chen was delighted. Xia Chen had finally sensed his compass.

At this moment, Long Chen stopped moving. Standing atop the peak of a mountain, he calmly waited.

If Xia Chen had noticed him, then there was no need for him to continue chasing. Xia Chen would naturally transport to him. If they both started running to each other, they would just end up switching locations, and their senses would be thrown into disarray. They might not even be able to find each other.

Long Chen’s compass grew brighter and brighter. Xia Chen was getting closer and closer.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void quivered and a blood-soaked figure came out. It was Xia Chen. When Xia Chen saw Long Chen, his eyes immediately reddened.

“Boss!”

Xia Chen was choked with sobs. He was thin and haggard, and there was an unmistakable weariness and pain in his eyes that aggrieved Long Chen.

“Good brother. Everything is in the past.” Long Chen emotionally hugged Xia Chen. He then took out a healing pill for him.

BOOM!

Xia Chen had just consumed it when the void once more exploded. At this moment, a sword pierced toward Xia Chen.

“Xia Chen, you won’t get away.” That voice was icy, like a specter from hell.

“Likewise, I don’t know if you’ll be able to get away.” Killing intent exploded out of Long Chen. The Minghong Saber came flying out of its sheath, and a powerful mental energy instantly locked onto that person.
