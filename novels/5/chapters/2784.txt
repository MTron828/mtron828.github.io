Chapter 2773 The Next Crisis Descends

Wilde’s entire body was covered in glowing golden runes, and his eyes were like lanterns. He was like a golden giant erupting with Blood Qi.

Wilde didn’t know how to cultivate, nor did he understand how to use battle techniques. Since he relied entirely on brute power, there were no countermoves against him.

If someone with ample battle experience wished to guess Wilde’s next move, they would definitely die. It was unknown just how many experts had died like this to Wilde.

BOOM!

Even Ye Ming didn’t dare to be careless in front of Wilde’s ax and had to face him with his full power. He blew Wilde back once more, but his own hand began to bleed.

At this moment, Ye Ming’s spear swung to the left, blocking Ye Zhiqiu’s sword. When these two world divine items clashed, it unleashed a world of frost that froze and shattered the laws of the world.

Ye Zhiqiu was like an ice goddess, with numerous palaces of ice crystals appearing within her manifestation. With a single sword, she froze the very sky.

When Ye Ming blocked her attack, his entire body became encased with ice. The Ice Qi invaded his body, stabbing into his blood and flesh like needles.

“Undying Nether Qi!”

Ye Ming roared, shattering the ice covering him. After that, he swung his spear and was barely able to strike Mo Nian’s silent arrow before it hit him. Even one against three, Ye Ming was still in control.

BANG!

However, when he shattered Mo Nian’s arrow, which he had thought would be a killing blow, he found that it was empty of any power.

Using all his power on practically nothing caused him to stagger, and it was at this moment that another arrow thundered toward his chest. There was no time to dodge this.

BOOM!

The arrow exploded on Ye Ming’s chest. Even after circulating his Sovereign power, his chest was left a bloody mess.

“Mo Nian!” Ye Ming roared. Mo Nian was a conner.

Furthermore, knowing that Ye Ming would automatically sense any arrow to his head, Mo Nian intentionally aimed for his chest, dulling his senses.

It wasn’t a fatal wound, but the pain was real. The exploding arrow left many pieces of shrapnel in his body. That shrapnel was barbed, and taking it out would rip out quite a bit of flesh as well.

At this moment, Wilde had returned, charging straight at Ye Ming, and Ye Zhiqiu swung her ice sword.

Ye Ming repeatedly howled furiously. Wilde’s brute power was terrifying, while Ye Zhiqiu’s ice energy was so ferocious that he struggled to deal with it. But most infuriating of all was Mo Nian who was launching sneak attacks from a distance. Occasionally, he would even send the Central Plains Cauldron hurling toward Ye Ming.

The three of them actually managed to completely tie Ye Ming down, and he couldn’t be careless against any of them. One moment of overconfidence and he would be conned by Mo Nian.

Suddenly, the sound of a zither rang out and Ye Ming’s heart leaped. His aura suddenly grew sluggish for a moment.

BOOM!

Wilde’s ax fell, sending him flying. After that, Ye Ming turned back to see that Zi Yan had also appeared.

The current Zi Yan had reached the Emperor realm, and chilling killing intent exuded out of her. Her zither music was full of brutal murderous aura.

With every twang from her zither, Ye Ming felt his heart fluctuate. He was unable to prevent Zi Yan’s zither music from affecting him.

He blocked Ye Zhiqiu’s sword, only to be struck in the cheek by Mo Nian’s arrow. It almost pierced through his head.

Ye Ming was finally feeling fear. Zi Yan was playing the Devil Soul Refining Song, which had killed an unknown number of experts before this.

Now that she had advanced to the Emperor realm, and this song was being focused entirely on him, it felt like it was sucking away his soul. He had to resist its invasion as he fought, putting him at an immense disadvantage.

“Block him!” shouted Mo Nian suddenly. At this moment, his bow quivered and three arrows flew out. As soon as they appeared, Ye Ming had a bad feeling and tried to flee.

However, the three arrows flew toward him from three different directions, while Wilde and Ye Zhiqiu also attacked at the same time.

BOOM!

Ye Ming coughed up blood. He had to block Wilde’s full-power blow, resulting in him not having the power to stop Ye Zhiqiu’s sword from piercing his chest. Her attack froze his chest solid.

“Kill him!” shouted Mo Nian as their chance had come. Zi Yan’s Devil Soul Refining Song was absolutely terrifying. Even a Sovereign wasn’t able to resist it, leaving himself open to being killed.

The Undying race’s experts immediately rushed over when they saw things take such a drastic turn. Gui Si was the first to appear, going straight for Zi Yan. She was the most terrifying of the four of them.

“Scram!” Zi Yan suddenly slammed both her hands on the Southern Sea Zither. As a result, the seven strings shuddered, and divine light flew out of the zither, transforming into seven swords that slashed toward Gui Si.

Gui Si was then sent flying, tumbling back wretchedly. Seven bloody holes were present throughout his body when he finally managed to stabilize himself.

He was stunned. If it weren’t for Zi Yan focusing mostly on Ye Ming, he might have died from that attack. How could she be so terrifying?

What he didn’t realize was that Zi Yan had just experienced a great tribulation. A kind and innocent person had been forcibly transformed into someone filled with boundless resentment and hatred.

This kind of transformation from one limit to another, from white to black, from light to dark, would create a special kind of will. When a good person became a bad person, they reached the peak of that side. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Zi Yan had constantly received teachings to be kind, to not harm other lives. However, in the Yin Yang World, when the Southern Sea Zither sealed her cultivation base, she saw the dark side of people.

The Southern Sea Zither had planted a seed in Zi Yan’s heart at that time, and it had been suppressed by Zi Yan ever since then. She still chose to believe that this world was kind, that it was beautiful.

That suppression continued all the way until she and Long Chen were schemed against. Upon seeing Long Chen fall for a death trap because of her, upon seeing the Music Master’s hypocritical face clearly, that suppressed seed erupted. It instantly sprouted. Having been suppressed for so long, it unleashed unimaginable power.

The Devil Soul Refining Song was something Sovereign Han Wei created. However, Zi Yan had surpassed her in this regard. Her song was even more terrifying than hers.

If it weren’t due to the Southern Sea Zither needing half of its power focused on the barrier created by the five Sovereigns, just Zi Yan alone would be enough to handle Ye Ming.

With Ye Ming in crisis, countless Undying experts charged over, even detonating themselves in order to interfere on their battlefield. At this time, the Undying race’s terror was revealed. They had a solid belief and were unafraid of death.

“Pull back! Stop, stop fighting!” shouted Mo Nian. This was increasing the amount of blood soul energy filling the air. He pulled back Wilde who was still charging over. However, just at that moment, his expression changed.

BOOM!

The demonic beast race’s altar suddenly exploded, and a Sovereign crown appeared on the Nine-Headed Lion’s head. He had also become Sovereign.

The Nine-Headed Lion roared, shaking the land. A powerful aura unfurled and killing intent raged out of him.

“Long Chen, come out and face your death!”
