Chapter 3252 Spirit Psychic Bloodline

Qi Yu’s senior apprentice-sister had the beauty of a flower and the radiance of the moon. She was a famous beauty of the Yuhua Palace, and she was also very talented, with an illustrious background.

For a woman with such beauty and talent to favor Qi Yu was a great blessing.

But then, Jiang Baihe, the great-grandson of the palace master, also loved this beauty. However, she didn’t like his impatient and fretful character.

On the other hand, Qi Yu’s arrival instantly moved her heart. After all, every Dragonblood warrior possessed a bold, powerful, and fearless character. Compared to Jiang Baihe, Qi Yu was far superior.

Although Jiang Baihe possessed a powerful background, talent, and aptitude, this woman preferred a man like Qi Yu. She was even willing to have a falling out with Jiang Baihe for him, resulting in trouble.

The news of Long Chen’s accomplishments in the Nine Prefecture Convention eventually reached Qi Yu. At that point, he was stuck in a difficult position. He wanted to join Long Chen immediately, but crossing the devil sea was incredibly dangerous.

Furthermore, he was always in the Yuhua Palace and had no opportunity to come into contact with the Huayun Trading Company. Thus, he went to consult his senior apprentice-sister.

However, when she learned that he wished to leave, she cried, feeling like he was abandoning her. She was less important than his so-called boss to him.

So, Qi Yu was caught in a difficult position. On one hand, he had sworn to follow his boss to death. But on the other hand, he had a lover whom he had deep emotions for. She had also helped him out immensely during this time. Seeing her crying, ultimately, with a mix of shame and a sense of responsibility, Qi Yu stayed.

This was why Qi Yu couldn’t look Long Chen and Qin Feng in the eye. In his view, this was already a kind of betrayal.

His senior apprentice-sister was delighted that Qi Yu would stay behind, and he was also happy to see her happy.

However, good things didn’t last forever. When Qi Yu went out hunting with some new disciples, those disciples actually poisoned him. A batch of Yuhua Palace experts then came out to kill him.

After killing those new disciples, Qi Yu was surrounded by over ten Primals in the same realm as him. As he was poisoned and got several serious injuries, he was sure that death had come for him. Hence, he was prepared to drag a few others with him.

Just then, he inadvertently saw a Cloud Swallow foraging for food and then grabbed its claw. Feeling startled, it flew away.

The Cloud Swallow was a spirit beast. Although it wasn’t that powerful and was very cowardly, its flying speed was shocking.

Qi Yu was flown to some unknown location before being unable to hold on any longer. He then fell from the sky. At that moment, the poison had entered deep into his body, and he had no antidote. Luckily, he then saw the merchant ship of the Huayun Trading Company.

Without thinking about it, he charged over and said that he was from the Dragonblood Legion and that he wanted to see Long Chen. After that, he didn’t recall anything else.

“Boss, Qin Feng, I’m sorry…” Qi Yu was choked with sobs, crying like a child.

“What nonsense are you talking about? If you abandoned your lover, you wouldn’t even be qualified to be our brother. Even if you came, you’d be kicked out of the Dragonblood Legion. As a man, you naturally must know what your shoulders are carrying. If you let your woman suffer, all the Dragonblood warriors will look down on you.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Many thanks, boss…” Hearing that, a knot in Qi Yu’s heart finally came undone.

“We’re all brothers. What’s the point of being so courteous? Hurry up and tell us whether those killers were sent by that Jiang Baidiao!” demanded Qin Feng. He only cared about who had wounded Qi Yu.

“Brother Qin, it was Jiang Baihe.” Qi Yu thought that he hadn’t said it clearly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What Baihe[1]? He’s no good bird. Speak, was it him? We’ll settle things with him. Fuck, he dares to provoke the Dragonblood Legion? He doesn’t know how death is written,” said Qin Feng darkly.

“I’m fine. I feel like I can handle this matter,” said Qi Yu with his head down.

“Are you asking for a beating? You don’t view me as a brother?” raged Qin Feng. He grabbed Qi Yu’s collar.

“I… I…” Qi Yu’s face was forced up, showing his shame.

“Explain yourself!” demanded Qin Feng.

Qi Yu took a deep breath. “The ones who attacked me were Jiang Baihe’s subordinates. There were eight of them, and it was clearly a trap. He wanted to get rid of me so much that he was willing to kill the other disciples who went out with me. He’s gone crazy. Since he failed this time, he will definitely set up eyes throughout the Yuhua Palace. As long as I dare to go back, he’ll send people to kill me. He is the great-grandson of the current palace master. He’s also talented and powerful. It can be said he is unstoppable within the Yuhua Palace. I’m afraid that…”

“You’re afraid that I’m not a match for him?” asked Long Chen.

“Jiang Baihe’s character might be trash, but he has a spirit psychic bloodline. He can summon beasts to fight for him. Adding on his own power, he can beat a half-step Immortal King. He has power comparable to an Immortal King,” said Qi Yu, clenching his teeth.

Although Qi Yu detested Jiang Baihe, the latter was too powerful, and Qi Yu wasn’t on the same level as him. He wanted revenge, but he was unable to do it.

“A spirit psychic bloodline? Comparable to an Immortal King?” Qin Feng sucked in a cold breath of air. That guy was truly terrifying then. He already possessed such power in the Four Peak realm.

“Interesting. Let’s go see that Jiang Baihe!” Long Chen smiled.

In the Heavenly Swell Domain, he was already unmatched in the same realm. He had been a bit arrogant before, but then Luo Zichuan had beaten that arrogance back.

Now he knew that he was still a frog at the bottom of a well. If he wanted to get stronger, he had to spread his gaze further. Only by challenging experts could he know where he was lacking.

“Boss…”

Long Chen waved his hand. “Focus on recovering. Once you’re fully recovered, have Qin Feng bring you to the Luo family for some honing. Then we’ll go find him and those people that attacked you. It’s been unbearably boring around here lately. It’s time to get some exercise.”

Last time, Long Chen hadn’t even gotten a real chance to fight in the Chu family. He didn’t know just how great the difference between him and an Immortal King was.

Naturally, an Immortal King like Luo Zichuan only appeared once in a thousand years. Hence, how much stronger was Long Chen compared to an ordinary Immortal King? He had the desire to find out.

He heard that Mo Nian was able to make even World Kings unable to touch him. If he was already so strong, then Long Chen couldn’t fall behind.

Mo Nian had spread his name throughout the immortal world, while Long Chen’s name only resounded throughout the Heavenly Swell Domain. How could he accept that?

Long Chen had Qin Feng look after Qi Yu. After that, he went to see the deputy dean.

“When can you give me the status of the branch academy’s dean? I’m preparing to go out.”
