Chapter 3234 King Item

An explosion rang out as Luo Changwu and Luo Changwen broke a totem as well. Both of them had violet qi billowing around them. With a single slash of their swords, the totem exploded.

The two of them were truly worthy of being the Luo family’s top experts. Once they unleashed their full power, the other Primal Divine Lords of the Chu family were unable to stop them. They also knew that they had to break the altars, or things would turn sour quickly.

Thus, the two of them instantly started off at full power. No one was able to stop them from breaking the altars.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber also slashed through the air. The Chu family’s experts in his way were killed, unable to stop his saber that was slamming into the totem. The lives of the Chu family’s experts that had blocked it reduced the power of this attack, but the totem was still split apart. The altar also turned dim.

Long Chen then looked at Luo Changwu and Luo Changwen. The two of them were charging toward the other altar. Meanwhile, the rest of the Luo family’s experts were protecting their path.

Long Chen immediately rushed for that last altar. As long as the altars were destroyed, the Chu family’s schemes would fail.

“Stop them!”

One of the Chu family’s experts charged in front of Long Chen. Suddenly, his aura grew explosively, and Long Chen jumped in shock.

BOOM!

That Primal Divine Lord actually detonated right in front of Long Chen. The terrifying power was like a volcano erupting.

The life of a Primal Divine Lord exploded right in front of Long Chen. Long Chen was forced back by that terrifying power. His legs dug into the ground, leaving a long ditch. He almost spat out blood.

Long Chen hadn’t expected the Chu family’s people to be so vicious. They actually used their own life to stall for time.

Another Primal Divine Lord charged at Long Chen. Long Chen immediately unleashed a slash of his saber, not giving him time to detonate.

Luo Changwu and Luo Changwen were dealing with the same problem. The Chu family’s experts seemed to have gone insane. They were detonating just to block the Luo family’s experts.

“Bastards!”

The Grand Elder roared furiously and charged but was suddenly grabbed by Luo Changwu. Now wasn’t the time to force it. They would be the ones to lose out.

Just then, a rain of arrows flew through the air. A small squad of archers had appeared here, and hundreds of the Chu family’s experts fell.

Qin Feng was directing the combat. As he had stopped the rest of the Chu family’s experts from reinforcing them, seeing this critical situation, he sent a group of a hundred archers to assist.

It was very effective. The Chu family’s experts were once more caught off-guard by the arrows, causing the arrows to be very effective again. As a result, the pressure on Luo Changwu and the others decreased. They charged forward.

“Die!”

The Chu family’s experts went insane, and a few charged at those archers. These troublesome fellows had to be eliminated now.

Long Chen’s heart turned cold. He knew that that group of disciples was done for. No one could save them. He and the Luo brothers needed to eliminate the remaining altar. As for Qin Feng, he was dealing with countless experts and was already being forced back. Their side wouldn’t be able to hold out for long.

However, despite knowing that they would die, those disciples simply continued to unleash arrows. They faced death indifferently, treating every person that they killed as profit.

“Die!”

The Chu family’s experts quickly reached them. Quite a few of them were killed, but the remaining few quickly wiped out those archers. However, none of those archers made a sound. They were all stubborn warriors.

Seeing this, Long Chen clenched his teeth, killing intent blazed in his eyes. As lightning appeared beneath his feet, he charged left and right. With every swing of his saber, an expert was slain, and he rapidly got closer to the altar.

Right now, he had to rely entirely on fundamental techniques. There was no opening for any big moves. If it hadn’t been for Luo Zichuan’s pointers, Long Chen would definitely be at a disadvantage here. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Even in front of this many Primal Divine Lords, Long Chen was still attacking and defending steadily. Hence, the Chu family’s experts pounced on him, detonating one after another. Long Chen didn’t even have a chance to summon his battle armor. His saber danced as he got closer to the altar.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a black figure shot out of Long Chen’s body. Lei Linger flew away from Long Chen’s body, heading toward the altar. With everyone’s attention on Long Chen, they didn’t expect someone else to suddenly appear.

At this distance, by the time they reacted, Lei Linger had reached the altar. A black sword appeared in her hand and she struck the altar. As a result, the altar exploded.

Right now, Long Chen had the urge to slap his own face. He had actually forgotten that Lei Linger could now leave his body. If she hadn’t reminded him, he would be wasting this trump card.

Lei Linger had taken the form of a lightning girl. After destroying this altar, she flew toward the other altar.

Anyone who tried to stop her, whether they were Primals or simply ordinary Divine Lords, were simply blasted apart.

“Stop her!”

The Chu family’s experts began self-detonating in front of the final altar. Ripples spread in every direction, and even Lei Linger was forced back.

Just then, a dragon roar rang out and Long Chen was clad in golden armor. With everyone’s attention on Lei Linger, he finally had a chance to summon the Golden Dragon Battle Armor.

Long Chen then stamped on the air. The void collapsed, and he shot out like a meteor. His saber slashed toward the final altar.

Even in this twisting space, even with the Chu family’s detonating experts, Long Chen’s saber could ignore the laws of space to crush it.

The twisting space that was the result of their detonations was unable to stop Long Chen’s saber. This saber contained the essence of the Saber Dao that Luo Zichuan had transmitted to him.

Just as his saber was about to strike the altar, the void twisted and a pill furnace appeared, exploding Long Chen’s black saber.

As a result, Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood and flew back. He felt like his body had almost collapsed. The divine might of that pill furnace was terrifying.

Countless divine runes flowed on top of the pill furnace. Eyeing it, Long Chen actually got a familiar feeling.

“Daynight Furnace!”

Long Chen cried out. He instantly thought of the Pill Valley’s divine item. Although the construction wasn’t the exact same, the runes were a bit similar. The aura in particular was alike.

At this moment, the pill furnace slowly spun, and divine light flowed out of it. A figure then appeared on top of it. It was a withered elder that looked like a corpse that had crawled out of its coffin. Golden light shone in his eyes.

“So you actually recognize the origin of this pill furnace.”

His voice was dry and raspy, and it raised people’s hair. Upon seeing this elder, Luo Changwu and Luo Changwen’s expressions changed.

“That’s a King item!”
