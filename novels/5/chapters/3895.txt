Chapter 3884 World Extermination Palm

“Run!”

Someone cried out. When millions of malevolent spirits swarmed over them, sharp pain wracked their Yuan Spirits. Moreover, they all had a bad feeling. An intense sensation of terror made them instinctively want to flee.

Suddenly, heads began to explode. Their Yuan Spirits were sucked out by a mysterious force and devoured by those malevolent spirits.

Countless bodies crashed to the ground, creating a harrowing scene. However, people noticed that those who perished had weak Yuan Spirits. Only people with weak souls had their Yuan Spirits forcibly ripped out.

Those with powerful Yuan Spirits felt pain, but they were not substantially harmed.

“Don’t be afraid! Work together and charge out!” shouted one of them. Following his orders, the experts of Silver Moon City gathered. They prepared to charge out of this encirclement.

However, the Dragonblood warriors didn’t chase them. After all, they had to guarantee Long Chen’s safety. As long as these experts stopped attacking him, everything was fine.

Suddenly, the earth exploded and two giant hands reached out of the ground. Each palm depicted an image of a giant malevolent spirit.

“World Extermination Palm!”

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan shouted in unison, and those giant hands immediately slammed together like swatting a mosquito.

“No!”

Swiftly, the two hands covered the sky, leaving the Silver Moon City’s experts unable to react as they were crushed. Then the world became silent.

Everyone was dumbfounded. Those two hands were like soaring mountains, boundlessly large, giving off an incomparably shocking feeling. People then saw fresh blood slowly pouring out of the two palms. Within the blood, special runes could be seen giving off various energies. That blood, the Supreme Blood, slowly merged into the earth, dyeing the land red.

Everyone was silent, terrified by this attack. Looking at those hands, they shivered uncontrollably.

When the hands slowly opened, people only saw some specks on them but not a single corpse. Hundreds of thousands of experts were slain just like that, leaving behind no corpse or Yuan Spirit.

In such a solemn situation, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan suddenly clapped their hands in the air, causing everyone to jump. Just as they thought that the two were preparing some big move again, they realized that it was nothing more than a celebration of their victory. This technique had each of them controlling one hand, yet they executed the task perfectly. It was such flawless cooperation.

Both of them were earth cultivators and had the same master. As a result, their combination technique was also flawless, stunning everyone. After seeing this scene, anyone else attacking the Dragonblood Legion fled for their lives.

The only ones still fighting were Gu Yang and the city lord. However, the city lord was incensed at the moment. He had brought all the elites of Silver Moon City to fight for more primal chaos qi, but most of them were dead now.

“All of you can die!”

The city lord let out a powerful roar, causing the silver moon in his manifestation to appear on his forehead. He was absorbing the manifestation into his body, resulting in it being enveloped in a radiant silver light. In an instant, his aura surged, doubling in strength.

The next moment, he unleashed eighteen sword attacks at once. However, Gu Yang forcibly received all of them and continued to force the city lord back step by step. In the air, both Sword Qi and spear-images raged ferociously, accompanied by the echoes of dragon cries that shook the sky.

The ten thousand dragons in Gu Yang’s manifestation seemed to come to life, starting to move. With each motion, dragon qi flowed into Gu Yang’s body, causing his scales to ripple like the tide. His power then intensified crazily, growing beyond measure.

“You are the only one who’s going to die. Do you want to absorb the surrounding primal chaos qi to fully merge your Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone? Keep dreaming,” sneered Gu Yang. The power of ten thousand dragons flowed within his body, bestowing him with endless power. His spear danced in the air.

The city lord was shocked, never expecting this bald fellow to possess such power. Unbeknownst to him, Gu Yang had cultivated a secret art of the dragon race. As a result, on his own, he had absorbed almost half of that immemorial dragon king’s essence blood.

Gu Yang had also assimilated fragments of that dragon king’s divine abilities. Though incomplete, it was enough to benefit him. With these fragments, he swiftly grasped certain divine abilities that had previously eluded his understanding.

Because of the secret art of the dragon race, the essence blood of ten thousand dragons was flowing within Gu Yang’s body. He had suffered unimaginable pain to absorb them, but to actually control them was another matter.

That was because every dragon had its own will; it was very difficult to merge them all. However, after absorbing the essence blood of the immemorial dragon king, with its might, the essence blood of the other dragons could only submit.

So, for the first time, Gu Yang was capable of controlling the full might of ten thousand dragons. Even the full-power attacks of the city lord didn’t make him take a single step back. On the other hand, he was suppressing the city lord.

The city lord felt like he might explode in rage. He had gone through three treasure lands on his way here and had absorbed a huge amount of primal chaos qi. If he could absorb the primal chaos source where Long Chen was, he would definitely be able to merge his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone.

The city lord had indeed missed the best timing to merge his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone, but that did not mean that it was impossible. Even though he had become a Divine Venerate, he could still merge the two. The only requirement was an astronomical quantity of primal chaos qi, tens of thousands of times more than what a normal person needed.

For this one chance, he had waited tens of thousands of years. But then, on the verge of his success, some hateful bald fellow just had to block his path. This was his final chance, and if he missed it, he would no longer have any chance of merging them in his lifetime.

If he couldn’t fully merge his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone, he would never be a true Double Supreme, forever incapable of unleashing the full potential of a Double Supreme. Thus, he urgently needed more primal chaos qi. But it wasn’t just him. All the Supremes in the three thousand worlds wanted to absorb as much of it as possible.

Gu Yang perfectly blocked the city lord. No matter how the city lord tried, Gu Yang remained steadfast and unyielding. Frustrated, the city lord could vent his fury through anguished screams.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just as they were fighting, a mocking voice suddenly pierced through the air, and the sky became shrouded by blood-colored clouds.

“The great lord of Silver Moon City can’t even beat a member of the junior generation, someone who still reeks of his mother’s milk. What a joke. Children of the Blood race, teach this inferior human race what true power is!”

Successive experts emerged from within the blood-colored clouds, descending directly upon the Dragonblood Legion.
