Chapter 1564 No Need to Hold Back Any Longer

Translator: BornToBe

Zi Yan couldn’t help feeling sad. Although she had known the chances of reaching a compromise with Long Chen were remote, she had still held onto some hope, but it was now extinguished.

Long Chen didn’t have any intention of letting these people off. He wanted to kill them all.

“Long Chen, you...!” His enemies naturally panicked. The reason why they had joined the side they were on was naturally not because of Long Chen, but because of Pill Valley. Long Chen clearly wanted to kill them.

However, the person who was speaking was stopped by Yan Weishan. He had a faint smile, knowing that he had just pulled in a terrifying helper.

Right now, everyone was trapped in this huge formation. No one could run. As long as Zi Yan joined their side, Long Chen and his Dragonblood Legion would definitely die.

“Sorry, I might have to disappoint you, Long Chen. I can’t just watch as you kill them,” said Zi Yan sadly.

Zi Yan was aggrieved. She had done her best to avoid a conflict with Long Chen, but reality was constantly forcing her to stand on the opposing side. Perhaps that was fate.

“There’s nothing to be sorry about. I just have this kind of temperament. Gratitude and grudges must be repaid. Once we start fighting, life and death will only be separated by a fine line. Don’t hold back because I definitely won’t. Whether you kill me or I kill you, neither one of us has to say sorry,” said Long Chen calmly.

Many people were able to hear the complicated emotions between them, and yet the two of them were still going to have a life and death match. For a moment, no one said a word.

The neutral camp’s experts were filled with pity. Both Long Chen and Zi Yan were experts at the top of their generation. One was a peerless domineering hero, while one was a beauty who could cause the downfall of a nation. Their feelings toward each other were easily seen through.

Now, they had ended up at their current point, and Long Chen’s final sentence was especially painful to hear.

However, Yan Weishan’s smile bloomed. He was an expert from Pill Valley. Others might not know Zi Yan’s power, but he did. It was related to ancient secrets.

Zi Yan slowly rose. A seven-string ancient zither appeared in front of her, and her white dress fluttered along with her long hair. She looked like she had just walked out of a painting.

As her hands began to pluck the zither, all the world’s energy seemed to listen to her music’s call. A mass of primal chaos formed behind her. Within that primal chaos, an image of an ancient zither slowly appeared.

Furthermore, the sound of a zither came from her manifestation. That was something that had not occurred in anyone else’s manifestation.

It was like a current of divine music, filling heaven and earth. It also filled people’s hearts, cleansing them and making them forget about their desire to kill and fight.

“My manifestation is different from other people’s. It’s a unique manifestation of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace. Its name is Divine Music Through Eternity,” said Zi Yan softly.

Hearing that, the expressions of all the Empyreans changed.

“This Zither Fairy is very powerful. Not only has her manifestation started to awaken, but it’s also an unrivaled existence in this world,” sighed Chu Yao.

“What’s different about it compared to other Empyrean’s manifestations?” asked Tang Wan-er.

“Other people’s manifestations are like a field with many people planting a seed inside it. Each person is able to slowly grow their seed into a towering tree. However, the first person to fully awaken their manifestation will be the only one with a towering tree. The others will just be minor figures setting off their brilliance. As for the Zither Fairy’s manifestation, it belongs only to her. It should be related to her cultivation technique. It’s like there’s only a single tree in the field, so all the nutrients are given to her. For her, awakening her full manifestation is just a matter of time. In other words, as long as she doesn’t die, she will definitely become a true Empyrean,” said Chu Yao. She looked at Long Chen profoundly.

Divine music was still playing. It wasn’t being played by Zi Yan or her zither. Instead, it came from within her manifestation. It was constantly cleansing people’s souls, dispelling their desire to fight.

Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and Meng Qi looked at Long Chen. They actually had the same intention as Zi Yan. They all wished for Long Chen to back out of this awkward situation. Friends were friends. There was no need to turn them into enemies.

“The song is a divine song, the music is immortal music. It can cleanse a person’s heart and soul. However, in the end, it’s just an outer appearance. Once the divine song is over, people’s greed, brutality, and desires will flourish once more. Even if you could spread your divine song throughout the heavens, so what? Once people are used to the music, their true nature will reveal itself. Even gods and immortals can only do so much,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Long Chen suddenly slammed his hand onto Dragonbone Evilmoon. The sound resounded through heaven and earth, and a berserk desire to slaughter filled the air.

This berserk sound clashed with Zi Yan’s music, shaking the world as two invisible forces raged in the air. The two sounds suddenly vanished, and the world returned to silence.

“Long Chen, be careful. That girl is the only one here who can kill you,” warned Evilmoon.

“Someone who can kill me in the same realm has yet to be born.”

Long Chen’s reply was indifferent. That wasn’t arrogance, but the confidence he had to have to cultivate the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. If he didn’t have this confidence, then he wouldn’t be fit to cultivate the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The world was tense with silence. It was calm before the storm, and the tension made it hard for them to breathe.

Suddenly, the world began to shake. Everyone jumped in shock and hastily looked into the distance to see a mass of experts outside the barrier.

The powerful senior experts of the Corrupt path, ancient races, ancient family alliance, Martial Heaven Alliance, Pill Valley, and the others had come and were using divine items to attack the barrier. Their attacks caused huge ripples to appear on the barrier, but it didn’t break.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, you’re dead! The top experts of the various sects have all come. There’s no way you can run!” laughed a rank nine Celestial upon seeing his sect master.

“Long Chen, you’ve slaughtered the innocents. Don’t you think you should kneel and pay for your sins?” shouted another person loudly. Their confidence was restored.

All the experts on the outside were attacking the barrier, causing it to rumble. The barrier’s runes were in the midst of dimming. It was clearly about to break.

“Long Chen, if you give up now, I will protect you and let you leave,” said Zi Yan.

“Zither Fairy, what do you think you’re doing?” demanded Yan Weishan.

Zi Yan ignored Yan Weishan and looked only at Long Chen. However, she was disappointed when Long Chen shook his head.

“I’ve sworn not to run again. Prepare yourself. We’re going to start fighting.”

The divine ring behind Long Chen began to spin once more, and his Yuan Spirit appeared, rapidly forming hand seals. Streaks of light spread throughout his body and connected.

“Split the Heavens 5!”

Long Chen knew that Zi Yan was a terrifying opponent. Hence, he immediately used his strongest attack, and a huge saber-image tore through the void at the wildly shouting experts.

Zi Yan sighed and plucked her zither. A wave of light spread. A second sound rang out from her manifestation, and another wave spread from it as well. The two waves joined and struck Long Chen’s saber-image with astounding speed.

When Zi Yan’s two waves of light connected, they actually formed a huge spatial blade. That spatial blade shocked everyone, as it seemed to throw space and time into chaos. This was a kind of divine power that had surpassed the limits of other powers.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber-image and the spatial blade met, causing heaven and earth to shake. However, there was no explosion.

The two forces caused a berserk vortex in the air, but space quickly twisted, and the vortex shrank until it slowly vanished. Space returned to calm.

Everyone was simply stunned. Even the people on the outside slowed down their attacks, most likely from shock.

“What... kind of power is that?”

If the two attacks had caused a huge explosion that destroyed the land, that wouldn’t cause so much shock. However, their attacks had strangely vanished instead. Everyone was shocked. This was some kind of unknown force.

“Is the Zither Fairy able to use her divine item due to her manifestation?” Unable to comprehend that power, many people came to such a conclusion.

Yan Weishan, Jin Mingwei, and Hu Xiaolin were shocked, as well as envious. This truly was the power of a divine item. Zi Yan’s manifestation had a special origin and was connected to the divine item in her hand, the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither. That allowed her to unleash a portion of its power.

“Damnit, if Long Chen had learned the sixth form of Split the Heavens, there’s no way his attack could be erased like this,” cursed Bao Buping regretfully.

He and Bao Buping had already learned the sixth form. However, their power was limited, and they could not unleash the sixth form’s full power.

The sixth form’s power was ten times greater than the fifth. In Long Chen’s hands, it would definitely be able to unleash immense power. However, the profundities behind the sixth form were not something that could be explained in just a few words. So Bao Buping and Chang Hao were extremely vexed.

Long Chen took a deep breath and rested Evilmoon on his shoulder. “Meng Qi, don’t hold back any longer. Summon it!”

Meng Qi’s expression changed. She looked from Zi Yan to Long Chen. “Do we really have to do this? Is it really worth it?”

“Yes. Enmities must be repaid. We can’t mix it with other feelings. Cloud’s blood cannot be bled for nothing. It doesn’t matter who or what reason they have, no one can stop our vengeance,” said Long Chen resolutely.

When Meng Qi heard Long Chen bring up Cloud, her hesitation vanished. She slowly formed hand seals, and a vast Spiritual Strength began to rise.

Spiritual Strength filled the world, causing the void to shake. A huge entity landed on the ground, and an ancient, desolate aura spread.
