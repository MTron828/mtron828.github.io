Chapter 2088 Withdrawing?

White robes that were untouched by the dust of the mortal world and enveloped by a water-like curtain of light set off an unmatched beauty.

That light was not actually water, but fire. Although the high heat had been concealed, it was possible to sense intimidating energy fluctuations that could incinerate seas.

“The Pill Fairy Yu Qingxuan!”

Many people recognized her because she was extremely easy to recognize. There was a ring of divine light behind her that sprinkled her with a holy and noble air. She was a divine daughter, one who looked down on everyone else in the world.

This was the power of a god within the halo of light behind her. It was an unblockable power that granted her the special status of divine daughter.

She was a disciple of a god and had received the god’s blessing and care. With the god’s power backing her, she was qualified to look down on everyone else within the same realm.

Even amongst this group of supreme geniuses, she was still an existence that everyone focused on. Her arrival caused countless experts’ hearts to shake.

The gods were transcendent existences, and although they could not descend upon the Martial Heaven Continent, their disciples were always above everyone else due to their blessing.

The Pill Fairy’s arrival coincidentally came just as Long Chen was about to leave, and she was now blocking Long Chen’s path. She looked at Long Chen without the slightest emotion in her eyes.

Long Chen was also looking at the Pill Fairy, however, his eyes contained lament and regret.

“Do you want to say something?” asked the Pill Fairy.

Long Chen sighed. “There’s nothing to say. If something has to be said, then tell me how that girl Wan Qing has been lately? She must have grown up quite a bit.”

Only when he brought up Wan Qing did the slightest warmth appear in the Pill Fairy’s eyes. She seemed to have lost herself in some memory. “Wan Qing is doing very well. She’s growing even more beautiful, and I’m also preparing to transmit all my alchemy arts to her. If nothing unexpected happens, she will be the future valley master of Pill Valley.”

Long Chen shook his head slightly. “She is a talented alchemist, but she’s definitely not suited to wielding power. You are throwing her into a pit of fire.”

Although he hadn’t known Wan Qing for that long, he knew her character. There was no way she could pick up the burden of being the valley master. That would only bring her pain.

“People can always change. She might not have been able to do such a thing before, but that doesn’t mean that she won’t be able to do it in the future. People need to work hard to change their own fate, or they will only be run over by others,” said the Pill Fairy indifferently.

Looking at the Pill Fairy’s face, Long Chen sighed. “Changing one’s fate is correct, but the initiative should be in the hands of the one whose fate is being changed. Otherwise, if it is only for someone else, all that hard work won’t change their fate. People live only one life, plants grow only for one spring. Their time is limited. If you can’t be free, that time can only be a kind of grief.”

A slightly lost expression appeared in the Pill Fairy’s eyes, but they quickly became icy once more. “Even if free, people should understand their responsibility. Some things were fated from times long past. People should not be afraid of continuing that path forward,” said the Pill Fairy.

“If it’s long since fated, why bother cultivating? Cultivation is in itself to defy the heavens, to break through shackles, and to transcend bindings. If people’s fates were set before being born, what is the point of risking our lives to cultivate?” Long Chen shook his head.

Long Chen and the Pill Fairy were both standing in the sky, facing each other. As for the other experts, most of them knew of the relationship between the two of them.

However, now the two were enemies. When Long Chen had caused chaos in the Brahma secret realm, the Pill Fairy had tried to kill him. Countless people had witnessed that. The two of them speaking again made everyone forget about the matter of Long Chen kicking Zhao Wuji.

“Your so-called freedom also needs a limit. Past that limit, the only thing that exists is death. The gods are everywhere, and the laws of the Heavenly Daos cannot be exceeded. You have repeatedly damaged my Pill Valley’s prestige and even blasphemed the divine statue. The only thing that awaits you is death. That is the only way to wash away your sins,” said the Pill Fairy chillingly.

Naturally, the matter of blaspheming the divine statue referred to how Long Chen had carved ‘Bastard’ onto Lord Brahma’s statue in the Brahma Divine Palace.

That matter was unknown, and while these experts didn’t know what exactly she was referring to, just the fact that Long Chen had dared to blaspheme Pill Valley’s divine statue made these experts jump.

Seeing the cold light in the Pill Fairy’s eyes, Long Chen shook his head. “You are no longer the old Pill Fairy. There’s no need to say any more.”

Long Chen could no longer find the slightest familiar feeling within her eyes. Perhaps the High Priest was right. Once the Pill Fairy became the divine daughter, she would be one with the god’s will. It could be said that she was just a personification of the god, or more accurately, a puppet that the god controlled.

“Long Chen, let’s continue our fight. Today, I, Zhao Wuji, will kill you!” Zhao Wuji finally had a chance to interject.

Just at that moment, a zither twanged. That sound startled everyone and they hastily turned.

What they saw was a woman walking gracefully over to them. Every step she took seemed to embody the music of some kind of Grand Dao. Every smile, every frown, every single one of her movements contained some kind of Dao charm.

“Zi Yan!”

Long Chen sensed another feeling in his heart, one that he didn’t know how to describe. He didn’t know whether or not it was a good thing that she had come. Was she a friend or a foe?

The Zither Fairy’s arrival naturally interrupted Zhao Wuji’s challenge. Zi Yan smiled at Long Chen. “We meet once again. Have you been well?”

Long Chen was startled. It seemed that she didn’t come bearing hostility. “I have been well. Many thanks for your care.”

Along with the arrival of the Pill Fairy and the Zither Fairy, more and more experts were drawn over. This place became packed.

Dongfang Yuyang said, “The new auction room has been prepared. I’d like to ask everyone to move over there, but I hope there are no more unexpected accidents this time. Other than that, brother Zhao, brother Long, this place is the Dongfang family, and we won’t interfere in any personal enmities. However, I hope that the two of you can give my Dongfang family some face and leave your matters until after this gathering is concluded and you’ve left the Dongfang family. Can’t you resolve things afterward?”

Dongfang Yuyang acted very modestly, but this time, Long Chen and Zhao Wuji had definitely gone too far. They had almost torn down the auction room. This was now a matter of face.

After all, this gathering was being hosted by the Dongfang family. Everyone who had come was their guest. If others went too far, it would be taking advantage of them as a host and would be treated as a provocation.

Zhao Wuji had been warned, and Shi Lingfeng had also been warned. As for Long Chen, Dongfang Yuyang viewed him as someone very important, so Dongfang Yuyang hadn’t said any heavy words to him.

However, Long Chen had fought inside the Dongfang family several times now. He was clearly trying to probe Dongfang Yuyang’s bottom line, which was not giving him any face at all.

At first, Dongfang Yuyang’s treatment toward Long Chen had made people think that he was biased and that the two of them had to have some kind of secret relationship. However, with how often Long Chen was causing trouble, people now thought that the two of them definitely didn’t get along. Otherwise, Long Chen would have at least resisted to act to give Dongfang Yuyang face.

“Sorry, I simply have this kind of temper. If someone has an issue with me, they can come at me but not insult my people. Otherwise, even if it was the king of the heavens, I wouldn’t let them get away with it,” said Long Chen. “Since that’s the case, I’ll withdraw from this gathering. To tell the truth, this so-called gathering of past and present heroes has disappointed me.”

Everyone’s expressions changed slightly. Long Chen’s meaning was that of the people here, only a few had entered his eyes. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Since he hadn’t given any names, no one was willing to reply. However, his words clearly contained a feeling like he was looking down on them. But if they said anything, it would be taking a general comment as a personal attack.

“Long Chen, what are you trying to do? If you want to leave, then leave. If you want to stay, then stay. Just being allowed to come is an honor to you. Why act like you’re some big wig?” Shi Lingfeng was the first to respond. He knew that he was definitely amongst the number of people that Long Chen was talking about.

“You’re disappointed? I’d say that you’re the most disappointing of everyone here. A generation’s expert without the slightest manners of an expert naturally can’t get along with us. Criticizing others just shows what a petty little person you are. Such a person is not fit to attend this gathering,” said Huang Feiyan of the Xuan Beasts.

“A selfish person like you won’t be able to make any major accomplishments. If you want to leave, then leave. No one will stop you.” Another person in the crowd spoke out, dissatisfied with Long Chen.

Quite a few other experts were looking at Long Chen coldly. Although they didn’t say anything, it was possible to see the disdain in their eyes. Their meaning was clear: it did not matter if he was in this gathering or not.

In truth, the way that Long Chen had been talking and laughing with Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, Ye Lingshan, and Ye Zhiqiu had drawn the dislike of many people. Now that Long Chen had said that he wanted to leave, most people wanted him to hurry up and scram.

“Let’s go.”

Ye Zhiqiu held Long Chen’s hand. She knew Long Chen’s character. He wouldn’t just sit by and endure while Zhao Wuji insulted his lovers. That was his reverse scale that no one could touch. This flaw had already been found out by everyone, and they knew that using this method to antagonize Long Chen would always be effective.

This was a fatal weakness, but it was also what made Ye Zhiqiu’s heart his. A man who was willing to risk his own life for his women was a blessing.

Long Chen smiled at Ye Zhiqiu, seeing the warmth in her eyes. The two of them prepared to leave.

Ye Lingshan sighed, “Since that’s the case, I’ll leave too. Many thanks for your hospitality, mister Yuyang.”

Ye Lingshan moved, and then Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang also followed. It was Beitang Rushuang who said, “How boring. If I had known the gathering would be like this, I wouldn’t have come.”

The two of them both walked away, causing Dongfang Yuyang’s expression to change.
