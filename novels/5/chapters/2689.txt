Chapter 2678 My Fury is the Heavens’ Fury

The sea exploded into the sky, as though it was enraged as well. Powerful currents flew through the air.

At this moment, the entire world had gone berserk. It was as if a volcano had erupted, unleashing an apocalypse.

As for Long Chen, he was the god of that apocalypse who had come to the world.

The shocking anger of heaven and earth shook people deep into their souls. In the face of that fury, they could only cower.

“The Heavens’ Wrath? No, my fury is the fury of the heavens. From the moment that I came to this world, it was fated that I would control it, not that the heavens would control me.” Long Chen’s voice was emotionless. When he spoke, everyone’s hearts trembled.

Was Long Chen provoking the Heavenly Daos? Was he not afraid of being destroyed? Was he not afraid of being rejected by the Heavenly Daos and never being able to cultivate again?

“A heretical technique. A bluff. Three Flowers Converge, Ten Thousand Daos Slaughter!” Long Aotian shouted, and his spear unleashed the same attack once more.

The void shuddered again as a black light pierced toward Long Chen. Its aura was even greater than last time.

“An attack combining ten thousand laws, ten thousand Daos? So what? Man comes from the earth, the earth comes from the heavens, the heavens come from the Dao, and the Dao is natural. To be natural and unrestrained is the true Dao. Why bother restricting it into laws? Those so-called laws are fish trapped in a net, people trapped in cages, all creations in slavery, and spirits in servitude. All creation belongs to me, all spirits follow my way. I contain all their fury. All their limitless power is mine. I will not be restrained by any laws or any heavens!”

Long Chen’s voice rang throughout every corner of the world. It was backed by the voice of all living things. His final sentence, ‘I will not be restrained by any laws or any heavens’, in particular caused the world to shake. It was as if countless voices were speaking along with him, shaking people’s ears.

These were Long Chen’s heartfelt words. However, they also felt like the heartfelt words of all life. The anger of all creation could clearly be sensed from him, and endless power was pouring into Long Chen’s body.

“Babbling nonsense won’t change your fate of being killed,” sneered Long Aotian.

Long Aotian’s spear once more stabbed toward Long Chen. In the face of this attack, Long Chen slashed Evilmoon, and a black saber-image containing endless power slashed onto the spear-image.

BOOM!

This was a world-shaking blow. One contained all the power of the Heavenly Daos, while the other contained the fury of all life. Hence, the world instantly lost all color. Following that, a black sphere quickly expanded.

It felt as if the world was spinning. Quite a few people fell unconscious.

“Space is in chaos!”

The laws of space were no longer orderly. That feeling was like they were tossed into a whirlpool or being crushed by a giant boulder. They couldn’t tell which way was east or west, north or south, left or right, up or down. To cultivators that were used to being in control, this was an even worse feeling.

Fortunately, this chaos only reigned for a moment before stopping. The feeling faded, and people managed to see Long Chen and Long Aotian once more.

Their two weapons were still clashing, unleashing black ripples in every direction. As a result, giant spatial tears were constantly appearing and healing.

“What kind of power is this? It’s enough to spark despair.” Watching this scene, even the fellow heavenly geniuses of this generation felt miniscule in front of the two of them. The difference between them was truly great.

Mo Nian, Hu Feng, Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, and the others were also staring in shock at Long Chen. When did Long Chen learn such a terrifying technique?

Only Yun Tian’s expression was still calm. That incredibly intense battle didn’t draw his interest. His gaze wasn’t locked on Long Chen but on Sovereign Yun Shang.

At this moment, a mysterious rune lit up in Yun Tian’s eyes, and the same rune appeared in Sovereign Yun Shang’s eyes. It seemed as if the two of them were communicating.

As for Zi Yan, she was seated in the sky, her hands on the Southern Sea Zither. The Southern Sea Zither was emitting fluctuations that enveloped her. Meanwhile, her eyes were closed as if she was meditating.

At the edge of the core region, the Pill Fairy was holding Wan Qing’s arms. Wan Qing had long since cried her eyes red, having never imagined that her mighty big brother Long had such a miserable origin.

On the other hand, the Pill Fairy’s expression had not changed at all from the start. Whether it was the appearance of the five Sovereigns or Long Aotian’s sudden reveal of power, nothing seemed to interest her.

While staring at Long Chen, her eyes lost focus. It was as if she was lost in thought, but it was unknown what she was thinking.

As Long Chen and Long Aotian’s power increased, the berserk chaotic phenomenon that they were causing also increased. It felt as if their power was limitless as it continuously rose.

BOOM!

Finally, the black sphere growing around them exploded, and sharp astral winds shot out like blades.

As a result, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, the dragon woman, and Ye Ming were caught by those astral winds. Giant ripples exploded as they blocked the winds.

At the center of the battlefield, Long Chen and Long Aotian separated. The two of them stared at each other like leopards looking at their prey.

Just now, they had ended up even, which then made Long Aotian’s expression change slightly. He had underestimated Long Chen. It had to be known that in his current state with the Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Diagram, he was in full control of the Heavenly Dao energy of the world. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, Long Chen had the wrath of all life. All lifeforms in the world were giving him their fury, and this gave him another kind of energy, making him capable of contending with Long Aotian’s Heavenly Dao energy. The latter hadn’t expected such a thing.

“Good, it seems that you do have the qualifications to fight me. Then the warm-up is over. I’ll bring out my true power to end you.”

Long Aotian pointed his spear at Long Chen, his mouth curling into an icily arrogant smile.

“What?!” Startled cries rang out.
