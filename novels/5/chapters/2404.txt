The divine pill plaza was quickly filled up. It was square like a chessboard and was filled with disciples. Normally, this place was used as an exam room for the Divine Pill Division’s disciples. This allowed them to pick out the most outstanding disciples and give them greater benefits.

Normally, each disciple would have a huge space between them and others. But today, there were only two large platforms set up in the center.

Ye Qian was already seated on one. He had his eyes closed in meditation. Compared to his previous appearance, he looked like a completely different person.

“Ye Qian really is skillful. Once he focuses on his alchemy, he can instantly reach a perfect mental state,” whispered Wan Qing.

Although she didn’t like him, she had no choice but to admit that he was shockingly talented at alchemy, even more so than her.

“Senior Feng Fei has also come!” exclaimed Shen Chengfeng. Following his gaze, Long Chen saw a small empty area.

Everywhere else was filled with people, but that one spot only had Feng Fei and a dozen attendants revolving around her. Even amongst that group of beautiful women, Feng Fei stood out.

Feng Fei looked back at Long Chen, seemingly with some surprise. She most likely hadn’t known that Long Chen could refine pills. Beside her, an attendant was whispering something to her; her eyes were also locked on Long Chen. Most likely, she was giving Feng Fei some information on him.

Looking around, Long Chen noticed that the ones who had come were the young disciples of the divine families. He didn’t see members of the senior generation.

The Pill Doyen had appeared on the overseeing platform. It seemed he was very interested in the upcoming competition.

“Big brother Long Chen, you have to win!” Wan Qing was still nervous. If he lost, the consequences would be worse than if he was killed.

“Don’t worry. Have you forgotten? Your big brother Long Chen is a Warrior of the Starry Sky. I’ll pluck some stars for you in the future,” said Long Chen.

Wan Qing smiled. She was no longer that foolish girl from back then. Even though she now knew that the story had been nonsense, she was still happy. For an imposing hero like Long Chen to make up stories to amuse her as a child warmed her heart.

Long Chen slowly walked over to his platform. Since one was already occupied, it went without saying that the other was his.

As soon as he walked in, people began whispering about him. They had clearly investigated who he was.

“How can a frog at the bottom of a well who hasn’t seen the world be qualified to challenge senior apprentice-brother Ye Qian?” Suddenly, loud voices began to ring out over the crowd.

“That’s right. With senior apprentice-brother Ye Qian’s honorable status, how can a dog or cat challenge him?”

“He’s clearly using this opportunity to elevate his own status. What a sinister person. Whether he wins or loses, he benefits.”

“Despicable.”

“Shameless.”

“Lowbred.”

The ones speaking were people wearing the robes of the Divine PIll Division. They were practically directly cursing Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his head and walked onto his platform.

“This seclusion of mine lasted for twenty-three years. Who would have thought that the disciples of my Divine Pill Division would end up getting so energetic? Not bad,” said the Pill Doyen.

The division head began to sweat. The Pill Doyen was not happy. He hastily said, “Qian-er is the strongest alchemist of the junior generation and is viewed as an idol by his peers. Now that someone has provoked him, those disciples naturally feel dislike for Long Chen…”

“Dislike means being allowed to spit on others? Why don’t you look at Long Chen’s expression? If this spreads further, it will lose the face of the Divine Pill Division. If Long Chen loses, it will be recoverable. But if he wins, it won’t just be a slap in the Divine Pill Division’s face but also in the faces of all the divine families. In my opinion, it seems that the position of division head needs to be replaced,” said the Pill Doyen slowly.

“Senior Pill Doyen…!”

“The current Divine Pill Division looks flourishing from the outside, but the disciples are too hot-tempered and egotistical. They don’t know how to exercise restraint. They are unable to reach the pinnacle of the Pill Dao, and that includes you. You’ve already walked down the wrong path. You have yet to understand the words I told you before I went into seclusion.” The Pill Doyen shook his head disappointedly.

“Everyone, shut up! What do you think you’re doing by spouting such vile words in public?!” The division head shouted, and the disciples cursing Long Chen instantly fell silent as if they had been slapped.

“Pill Doyen, I…” The division head looked at the Pill Doyen.

“We’ll discuss it later. Carry out the competition. I essentially already know the result,” said the Pill Doyen.

The division head helplessly nodded. Just at this moment, an Elder of the divine families appeared on the stage. “This competition is being personally presided over by senior Pill Doyen. Once it starts, there will be no room for regret. Are the participants ready and willing?”

Ye Qian smiled and confidently said, “Yes!”

Long Chen also nodded. The Elder continued, “Based on the agreement, Long Chen must pick one of the pill formulas contained within the Divine Pill Hall for this competition. Go ahead.”

The Elder sent an exceedingly ancient-looking beast hide over to Long Chen. It was covered in tiny characters.

Over ten thousand pill formulas were written on top of it, all of them over the tenth tier. But only eight hundred and seventy-three were of the twelfth tier.

“Since you wanted me to choose, then I won’t stand on courtesy. Today, let us refine the Life and Death Reincarnation Star Pill.” Long Chen pointed to one of the formulas.

When the name of the pill was announced, everyone turned deathly silent. The Elders and disciples of the Divine Pill Division were especially shaken.

Ye Qian sneered, “What nonsense is that? The Life and Death Reincarnation Star Pill requires the alchemist to have a cultivation base in the fourth step of Netherpassage. It requires Samsara power to refine.”

“Can you refine it?” asked Long Chen.

“Hmph, I naturally can’t, but you definitely can’t either,” snorted Ye Qian.

“You can’t refine it? Alright, then I guess that this competition is over. Pay up.” Long Chen walked off his platform and extended a hand.

“What are you talking about?” demanded Ye Qian. He started to get a bad feeling.

“You can’t refine it, and I can’t refine it either. This competition ends in a draw. According to our agreement, if there’s a draw, you have to pay me twenty million points. So, big boss, pay up. Many thanks.” Long Chen smiled. That smile was definitely sinister.

In the distance, Wan Qing covered her face, not wanting others to see her laugh. That would be rude. She had also underestimated Long Chen’s treachery. Ye Qian had essentially been scammed from the start and had fallen for its hook, line, and sinker.

Shen Chengfeng and the others were amazed. This really was sinister. Without doing anything, he had ripped a chunk out of Ye Qian. Just going up the platform and coming off was enough to earn him twenty million points?

“You!” Ye Qian’s hair stood on end. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so sinister.

“What? Are you backing out on your promise? No way. There’s senior Pill Doyen here overseeing everything as well as countless people watching.” Long Chen made a show of looking over the giant crowd.

“Long Chen!” The division head’s expression also changed.

“Shameless!”

“Despicable!”

“Lowbred!”

“Get the fuck out of the divine families! Someone like you isn’t fit to stay here!”

Every disciple present began to shout. They had originally been anticipating a competition between behemoths. They wanted to see how Ye Qian would beat Long Chen and show the might of the divine families. But instead, Long Chen used such a sinister trick?

Long Chen ignored their cursing. He looked at the sky, even extending a hand as if encouraging them to continue. He just wanted Ye Qian’s money.

“Being wrong isn’t disgraceful. What’s disgraceful is being wrong and not admitting to it, instead blaming others. I already said that one must be responsible for their own actions. Treat others as you wish them to treat you. That is the way to open your mind and create a greater path for yourself. However, you didn’t understand what I said twenty years ago. Not only have your own alchemy arts not progressed, but you also grew obstinate and opinionated, resulting in you raising such a herd of disciples.” The Pill Doyen shook his head at the division head. His tone was flat, as if nothing could make him angry. But the division head was sweating.

Although there was no master and disciple relationship between him and the Pill Doyen, the Pill Doyen had given him many pointers and had had high hopes for him. It could be said that despite the lack of a formal relationship, they were no different from master and disciple. However, this informal master of his was extremely disappointed in him.

“Disciple knows what he must do!” The division head nodded and suddenly stood up.

Seeing him take a stand, quite a few of the disciples began to cry for him to uphold justice.

“Senior division head, Long Chen is a swindler! Kick him out!”

“Trash like this actually dared to challenge senior apprentice-brother Ye Qian?! He’s not even fit to carry his shoes!”

“How can such a person just be expelled? He has blasphemed our sacred alchemy arts! He needs to be executed!”

“All of you, shut up!”

The division head’s voice rang out loudly in those disciples' ears, causing them to instantly shut their mouths.

“Ye Qian, you were the one who made the bet. Having a loophole you left exploited is your own fault, and if a person wishes to gamble, then they have to be willing to lose. Do you not know what you have to do?” The division head shouted at Ye Qian, causing him to turn green.
