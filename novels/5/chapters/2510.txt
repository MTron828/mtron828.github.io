Chapter 2500 Mishap

The Ghost Ship sped off, vanishing into the void. Once the Ghost Ship disappeared, the chaotic flow of space dried up and vanished without a trace.

At this moment, the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps pounced on Long Chen. A dark aura of decay came from their bodies as if they were from hell.

Long Chen glanced around and saw that others were also fighting in the distance. Mo Nian was shooting giant arrows.

Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, and with Evilmoon, he charged through the Black Armor Corps, turning them to dust.

“Evilmoon, what is going on?” asked Long Chen. This scene was too shocking. The Black Armor Corps seemed endless. Just where had so many of them come from?

“They are also a kind of dark race. When it comes to their source, they have a definite connection to the dark evil dragon race, although we are not the same race. They are very difficult to deal with because even if their bodies die, their soul essence is not extinguished. They can be awakened by certain kinds of energy to continue fighting. Although their current power is less than half of their peak when they were alive, the might of these fallen spirits is not small. Back then, the dragon king ended up exchanging serious wounds with their king, resulting in them both dying. The fiend king must have left his inheritance behind, while Ye Ming most likely came here just to obtain that inheritance due to also possessing dark energy. Now he controls the power of the fiend king, allowing him to revive the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps. Perhaps he has an even greater scheme behind this. You can’t be careless,” said Evilmoon heavily.

Long Chen’s heart shook. For the fiend king to have exchanged fatal blows with the dragon king meant that the two of them had to have been relatively evenly matched.

Then the fiend king’s inheritance was equivalent to the dragon king’s inheritance. Did that mean that Yun Tian was the one fated to counter Ye Ming?

Long Chen quickly approached Mo Nian’s battlefield and realized that Mo Nian was covered in blood. He was currently fighting two powerful opponents. One was his mortal enemy, Di Feng, while the other was the one who had been silent for a long time, the heavenly genius of the everlasting families, Dongfang Yuyang.

Dongfang Yuyang was covered in a red light that was like the sunrise. His manifestation was a mass of primal chaos. It was impossible to see what was inside.

He and Di Feng were attacking Mo Nian when they saw Long Chen arrive. Dongfang Yuyang snorted and suddenly unleashed a wave of Blood Qi. As a result, space twisted and he vanished.

In the next instant, hundreds of Dongfang Yuyangs appeared in the sky at the same time, attacking Mo Nian from every direction. Every one of them seemed to be a solid body.

“Dongfang Yuyang, you’re finally willing to come out of your tortoise shell?”

Long Chen sneered and joined in, slashing one of the clones. It was instantly blown up, and runes filled the air. There was no blood. It was not actually a true clone of flesh and blood.

“Be careful, this fellow’s very insidious. I’ve been caught off guard by him.” Mo Nian continued shooting arrows, sending Di Feng back with three attacks. After that, light flowed out of his bow, creating a starry barrier behind him that blocked over ten of Dongfang Yuyang’s clones from reaching him.

“Mo Nian, your death is at hand. Even if Long Chen has come, it won’t change your fate of being killed by me!” Dongfang Yuyang suddenly laughed. All of his clones exploded at the same time, and Long Chen felt the world suddenly become heavy. It felt as if a giant boulder was crushing him, making him unable to move.

“This technique…” Long Chen’s expression changed. He thought of a bad possibility.

“Senior apprentice-brother Di Feng, the two of them can no longer move! I’ll leave Mo Nian to you. I’ll take on Long Chen.” Dongfang Yuyang charged toward Long Chen.

Mo Nian’s expression changed. Divine energy surged out of him as he tried to escape these invisible shackles. However, he was still unable to move.

The chains were a law exceeding the scope of his divine energy. His divine energy was unable to touch them.

“Hahaha, nice move. Alright, Mo Nian, we can settle our grudges today.” Di Feng hadn’t expected Dongfang Yuyang to possess such an ability. Seeing Mo Nian bound, he sent his spear piercing toward Mo Nian’s head.

As for Long Chen, despite also being trapped, he wasn’t struggling. He just watched Dongfang Yuyang and sent Mo Nian a message.

“It ends here!”

Di Feng smiled sinisterly. His spear was just about to stab through Mo Nian’s head, but his body suddenly froze.

“What?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Di Feng looked down to see his spear covered by a white light. The brilliant divine spear quickly lost all its power and turned to stone.

It didn’t stop with his spear. His hand, arm, shoulder, and his entire body quickly turned to stone.

At that moment, a dazzling sword cut through the air. Di Feng was stuck in his stone state and unable to resist.

This attack, which seemed to contain enough power to chop through stars, slashed through Di Feng’s head. It then continued without pause toward Mo Nian.

However, Mo Nian’s figure suddenly vanished just as this thunderous attack was about to reach him.

The world rumbled. Di Feng was killed. A generation’s heavenly genius fell just like this, without even knowing how he died.

Mo Nian stood in the distance, staring in shock. He also had yet to understand.

If it hadn’t been for Long Chen warning him not to keep fighting the shackles but instead preserve his energy to escape at a critical moment, he might have been killed as well.

Only now did he see the wielder of the sword was a white-robed man. It was Dongfang Yuyang.

As for the Dongfang Yuyang that had been charging at Long Chen, he had vanished. Everything was strange.

Long Chen suddenly clapped his hands. “What a good trick. You must have been coveting after Di Feng’s life for a long time. How laughable that Di Feng had no idea that the person who wanted to kill him the most wasn’t Mo Nian or me but you, Dongfang Yuyang.”

The shackles binding Long Chen vanished. He appeared completely at ease. He hadn’t fought the shackles at all.

Dongfang Yuyang stood there with his sword with a confident smile. He no longer appeared as wretched and nervous as he had before.

“Hahaha, it seems that you realized a long time ago.” Dongfang Yuyang laughed. The primal chaos of his manifestation shook, absorbing the energy of heaven and earth.

The most shocking thing to Mo Nian was that after Di Feng was slain, his Blood Qi as well as the shattered remnants of his manifestation were sucked into Dongfang Yuyang’s manifestation.

“You… you’re… a Heaven-Seizer!” exclaimed Mo Nian.

A Heaven-Seizer. An extremely sinister existence that cultivated through slaughter.

A Heaven-Seizer, an existence capable of toppling the entire world. It was said to possess the most sinister kind of power, the ability to take the talent, bloodline, divine abilities, and even karmic luck of those that they killed.

There were several recorded cases of Heaven-Seizers appearing on the Martial Heaven Continent, but as soon as their identity was exposed, they were immediately hunted down and killed.

The Martial Heaven Continent would not allow such a figure to grow nor would it allow any power to raise a Heaven-Seizer. If they were noticed, that power would be wiped out to the roots.

Long Chen had been falsely accused of being a Heaven-Seizer, but in truth, everyone had known that he was no Heaven-Seizer. That had just been an excuse to kill him.

However, today, Mo Nian was personally witnessing a Heaven-Seizer, and it was someone he had never expected.

Long Chen shook his head at Dongfang Yuyang. “I didn’t know for sure, but I always suspected you. My cultivation technique is special, so I could sense that you possessed some kind of power that others didn’t. During the gathering of past and present heroes that your Dongfang family held, my guess is that you were picking out targets. After it, you ended up targeting me, which pissed me off, so I sent the sea demon race to break your legs. Unexpectedly, you really did endure, allowing yourself to be beaten rather than exposing your identity. You then spent the rest of your days hiding. That made me even more suspicious, but a guess is just a guess. I could never be sure. However, when you used that mysterious law to bind the two of us, I instantly knew that you were a Heaven-Seizer.”

“Oh? Why is that?” asked Dongfang Yuyang with interest.

At this moment, Dongfang Yuyang’s primal chaos manifestation had spread, blocking the Black Armor Corps from reaching them.

“That divine ability had a very similar aura to Shi Lingfeng, but its power was even greater and more skilled. It must come from the Stone Emperor, Shi Changsheng’s inheritance. That idiot Shi Lingfeng was killed before he could grow, but as a Heaven-Seizer, you were able to steal his good luck. Now that you’ve advanced to the fourth step of Netherpassage, your comprehension of the Stone Emperor’s divine abilities has surpassed him. So the lock came from Shi Changsheng. As for the blow you used to kill Di Feng, it was the Golden Peng race’s Void Breaker divine ability. In other words, you didn’t just take the Stone Emperor’s inheritance, but you also secretly stole Kung Pengzi’s fortune when I killed him. With the power of two Emperors, your target naturally moved to two other people. One was Tian Xiezi, while the other was Di Feng. Unfortunately, Tian Xiezi is not the Corrupt Emperor’s descendant and didn’t have that inheritance, so the bigger target was Di Feng. Am I right, Dongfang Yuyang?”

“Long Chen, you are forcing me to kill you.” Dongfang Yuyang sighed. He slowly raised his sword, and three figures gradually appeared in his manifestation.

Upon seeing those three figures, Mo Nian clenched his bow tightly.
