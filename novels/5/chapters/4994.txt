The Long clan had three Heavenly Chosens. Someone like Long Ziwei, who only condensed a Heavenly Fate Ring but not the complete Heavenly Fate Disk, could only be considered a half-step Heavenly Chosen.

However, this attacker was a true Heavenly Chosen, and he directly absorbed all the surrounding Doyen power.

“Scram!”

Pressing Long Zaiye to the ground, Long Chen was enraged to see someone interfere him. His left hand then transformed into a dragon claw and lashed out.

BOOM!

The attacker was sent flying by Long Chen’s dragon claw, but Long Chen himself also felt an immense impact. The ground beneath his feet collapsed.

As for Long Zaiye, blood sprayed from his mouth. Before this, Long Chen had gradually increased the pressure on him, shattering his knees. As a result, when the Heavenly Chosen struck Long Chen, the impact transferred to Long Zaiye, causing him to receive a heavy injury instantly.

Long Zaiye now resembled a deflating balloon, his strength rapidly draining away. With his bones shattered, he lay helplessly on the ground, akin to a beaten dog.

“Long Xiangkun!” Long Ziwei cried out.

Amidst the settling qi waves stood a man with long hair, his expression one of stunned disbelief. Long Ziwei immediately recognized him as the rank four expert on the Heaven Rankings. Long Xiangkun had been in seclusion for a long time, and upon emerging, he had become a Heavenly Chosen.

On the Heaven Rankings, Long Xiangkun was ranked fourth, but in reality, amongst this era’s heavenly geniuses, he was number one. After all, those ranked above him were not people of this era; they were sealed heavenly geniuses from ancient eras.

Before they were unsealed, Long Xiangkun had always been the number one expert of the Long clan’s junior generation. After undergoing the divine pool’s baptism, he went into seclusion, all before Long Zhantian arrived and flipped the entire Long clan on its head.

Thus, Long Xiangkun had been expecting the Long clan to cheer for him. In his mind, the higher-ups should have prepared something to celebrate his accomplishment.

However, when he came out, no one paid him any attention—not one of the four Heavenly Saints was present, and even the Heaven Overseer was gone. It was only after asking around that he learned how much had happened in the Long clan during his absence.

When he learned that the former member of the four Heavenly Saints was in Mercenary City, he immediately rushed over. He had a slight relationship with Long Zaiye. In all honesty, it wasn’t much of a relationship, but considering Long Xiangkun had become a Heavenly Chosen, he had to show off in front of someone. Otherwise, his new status would mean nothing.

Upon his arrival, he saw Long Chen suppressing Long Zaiye, and he recognized Long Chen.

Despite having heard that Long Chen had defeated Long Ziwei, Long Xiangkun didn’t view Long Chen as a threat. He simply summoned his Heavenly Fate Disk to show off his new status and didn’t mobilize its full power.

However, Long Chen didn’t stand on courtesy. He directly unleashed the power of his dragon blood and sent Long Xiangkun flying, causing the latter to almost cough up blood.

Long Xiangkun found it unfathomable that a non-Heavenly Chosen could block his attack, and this fueled his fury. He had once been the number one figure of the Long clan’s junior generation. However, his ranking had continuously fallen, going from rank one to rank two, then rank three, and now rank four. He was extremely aggrieved at not even being in the top three anymore.

Now that he had become a Heavenly Chosen, his power had multiplied exponentially, and he felt that he could challenge Long Tianrui. Unexpectedly, as soon as he came out of seclusion, he received a serious blow to his newfound confidence.

“Where did this arrogant fool come from?! How dare you behave so atrociously in the Long clan? I’ll make sure you die a terrible death today!” exclaimed Long Xiangkun, venting all his anger and resentment on Long Chen.

Long Xiangkun didn’t care who Long Chen’s father was. All he knew was that Long Zhantian was a petty little person who had run back to his homeland. With a furious roar, Long Xiangkun summoned a blood-colored spear in his hand. His Heavenly Fate Disk spun as he started to directly ignite his Doyen power.

He immediately went all-out, his berserk pressure even greater than what Long Zaiye had just released. In the distance, Long Ziwei finally bore witness to a Heavenly Chosen’s true power.

“Fine, since you want to die so badly, you can just die,” spat Long Chen with seething anger. Fang Liude’s death filled him with grief. Why did good people always meet such early ends, while idiots basked in undeserved glory?Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen tossed the gravely injured Long Zaiye to Long Ziwei. Keeping him alive now was a harsher punishment than swift death.

“Retreat a bit further,” Long Chen ordered curtly, Evilmoon materializing in his grip. Its malevolent aura permeated the air, even causing the laws of Heavenly Daos to falter in its presence.

Long Ziwei’s heart shuddered as he hastily grabbed the half-dead Long Zaiye and retreated. He knew that Long Chen was truly enraged this time.

Long Xiangkun’s spear thrust at Long Chen, and his Heavenly Fate Disk revolved rapidly, pouring all of its power into his spear. Long Xiangkun’s full-power attack shook Long Ziwei’s heart. Was he planning on deciding victory or defeat with this one attack?

“Dragon Blood Battle Armor!” Long Chen’s voice thundered, blending with a primal dragon’s roar. His divine ring materialized, enveloping him in blood-colored scales and a swirling cloak.

As Long Chen ignited his dragon blood, an overwhelming Blood Qi erupted, unparalleled in intensity. It was his first time harnessing the Dragon Blood Battle Armor's power since the divine pool's baptism, and its potency surged to new heights.

With no wasted motion, Long Chen raised Evilmoon. Without storing energy or invoking any divine ability, he brought it down in a slashing arc toward Long Xiangkun.

BOOM!

A milky white divine light exploded, unleashing an enormous qi wave that blasted out in every direction. Even the toughest rocks disintegrated in front of this qi wave. Now, the land looked completely flat.

Long Ziwei had retreated far away, but seeing the qi wave, he hastily shouted at everyone to run further.

Long Xiangkun was sent flying by Long Chen’s straightforward slash. Each attempt to halt his momentum caused the void to crumble beneath his feet, and he could only come to a stop on the ninth step. As he steadied himself, he spat out a mouthful of blood. Long Chen’s seemingly casual blow contained unimaginable power, shattering Long Xiangkun’s internal organs and leaving his bones feeling like jelly.

Long Xiangkun was dumbfounded. He was the top talent of the junior generation and had just awakened a Heavenly Fate Disk, becoming a Heavenly Chosen. However, he found himself unable to withstand even a single attack from Long Chen. Was this a nightmare?

“Die! Six Forms in One!” Long Chen’s voice rang out as he raised Evilmoon high. A colossal saber-image cleaved through the heavens, descending with a devastating power that reverberated through the world.
