Chapter 3316 Blown Up With a Single Punch

Qin Feng and the others were enraged. They didn’t know if he had sensed it or if he had investigated Long Chen, but he actually set his sights on Long Chen’s true dragon essence blood. That was the greatest insult.

“There’s no dragon blood, but if you need some dragon piss, just open your mouth. I can give you some right now,” said Long Chen contemptuously.

This fellow really was the same as Kun Pengzi. They were both arrogant fellows who thought themselves to be unmatched. He actually took the initiative just to provoke Long Chen. As too many people were courting death, Long Chen’s anger was starting to swell out of control.

“Courting death!” Kun Wu was enraged. Long Chen wanted him to drink his piss?

“If you want to die, I’ll help you out,” said Long Chen coldly, his eyes looking sinister.

In that instant, all the other experts that had come held their breaths. Just now, although there had only been a single probing blow between Kun Wu and Tian Mo, the power that they had shown was appalling. Now it seemed that a battle was about to erupt between Long Chen and Kun Wu.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Kun Wu narrowed his eyes and slowly smiled. “Inferior human race. You aren’t qualified to fight against me. Just wait, when the Heavenly Rainbow Flame appears, I’ll kill all of you. Hopefully, you won’t be so scared that you hide like a tortoise.”

After saying that, he left. Amongst the crowd, several other winged experts followed him. It seemed that Kun Wu’s position in the Feather race was quite high. He was the leader of this group.

The expert from the Feather race whose head had been cut off also followed close behind him. It seemed that he was one of his attendants.

“How gutless. Is eating the crap that you pushed out interesting?” sneered Bai Xiaole as they left.

It wasn’t just Bai Xiaole that was disappointed. Everyone was disappointed, but they also knew that despite talking disdainfully to Long Chen, Kun Wu was not so reckless as to want to fight Long Chen now.

With the Heavenly Rainbow Flame about to appear, he didn’t wish to expose his trump cards. He was also worried about being injured.

Long Chen’s expression was rather unsightly. Although he wanted to make himself relax a bit, he found that he was starting to lose control over his own emotions.

“Long Chen, are you alright?” asked Bai Shishi worriedly.

“I’m fine.” Long Chen shook his head. “It’s just that when it comes to killing people, I don’t have much patience. This isn’t good.”

Long Chen was a bit worried inside. He knew that this was the influence of the Purgatory Eyes.

The angrier he got, the more that dark energy grew, causing his emotions to go out of control.

Just now, he had only been the slightest bit away from starting a fight here. But the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was about to appear, and that was something that he had to obtain. If he lost it because of this fight with Kun Wu, that wouldn’t be worth it at all.

It was only thanks to this thought that he managed to suppress his killing intent. But the dark energy had been growing inside of him. One day, it might devour him, turning him into a murdering devil.

Just now, his hands started trembling out of his control. He had been about to attack.

Long Chen then brought everyone back inside the city and directly went into seclusion, leaving Bai Shishi and the others to keep an eye on any movements in the city. He needed to settle his emotions first.

During this time, countless battles erupted within the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. Experts from various paths and various races all gathered. Sometimes, a single gaze was enough to spark a battle. It was unknown just how many battles had been fought outside the city, but the Heavenly Rainbow Flame had yet to appear. There were countless competitors for it that had come.

However, right now, the ones that drew the most attention within the Heavenly Rainbow Domain were the Nine Underworld Hall’s Tian Mo, the Feather race’s Kun Wu, and Long Chen.

At the same time, everyone also knew that countless experts had flocked to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. It wouldn’t be surprising at all if some terrifying experts were lying in the dark. After all, they didn’t come here to make a name for themselves but to take the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

There were also countless old monsters watching them. They had come for their disciples and descendants.

The implications of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame were immense. Whoever obtained it might not be able to leave the Heavenly Rainbow Domain alive. Once the Heavenly Rainbow Flame’s master died, the flame would once more become a masterless item, and others would fight over it.

That was why every time it appeared, it would cause a storm of blood. There were already countless heavenly geniuses gathered, enough to practically blow apart the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

Days later, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue suddenly emitted divine light. After that, rainbow light illuminated the world.

When this manifestation appeared, countless people woke from their seclusion and looked up at the sky.

Countless stars revolved in the sky, and those stars condensed into specks of rain that slowly fell from the nine heavens.

“The Heavenly Rainbow Flame is about to descend!”

Long Chen was also roused out of seclusion. Looking at the specks of light, he tensed slightly.

Specks of light fell toward the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. Suddenly, a ball of light appeared in the southwestern part of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

“Let’s go!”

Long Chen was already rushing in that direction. All of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain quivered as countless experts unleashed their manifestations and full power to charge in that direction.

“Heavens, there are so many people!”

These Primals were like locusts swarming over the land, covering the sun. Bai Xiaole was shocked by this sight. There were more than ten million Primals here.

Countless experts were charging in one direction, causing this land to quiver. In front of this tide, an individual person seemed completely miniscule.

The Primals were as small as specks of sand within this tide. As for those that weren’t Primals, they could only watch at a distance. Even if they couldn’t compete, just being able to witness this was enough.

“Long Chen, you underworld ghost seed-!”

Lightning flowed around Long Chen’s feet as he shot through the air, but then a burst of astral winds struck him. The attacker was Yang Zicong.

This fellow had just been released two hours ago. Still filled with fury, when he suddenly saw Long Chen, he directly attacked.

Facing him, Long Chen unleashed a single punch, which resulted in Yang Zicong and his weapon exploding. Without a King item, he couldn’t block a single blow from Long Chen.

“Nice!”

After killing this dislikable fellow, Long Chen instantly felt refreshed. He had used the power of the Heavenly Daos in that attack. It was definitely more than enough against Yang Zicong, but its power stunned even Long Chen.

Long Chen finally reached that ball of light. He had just entered when he saw a large figure blocking his way.

“Long Chen, hand over your dragon blood.” Kun Wu revealed a set of frighteningly white teeth. He stared at Long Chen like a man-eating beast.
