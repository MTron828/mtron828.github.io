Chapter 4478 Ninth Heavenstage World King

Tribulation clouds gathered in the sky, and within them, Lei Linger swam, crazily absorbing the power of tribulation lightning.

Beneath the clouds, a bronze cauldron quivered. Divine light blazed all around it, and even the destructive might of the heavens was unable to suppress its sacred aura.

As it revolved, the tribulation clouds seemed afraid of it. However, the divine runes on the bronze cauldron were one with the ten thousand Daos, persistently drawing down an endless deluge of heavenly tribulation.

This marked Lei Linger’s thirty-sixth Saint pill tribulation. At first, she struggled to withstand this level of tribulation and would explode upon encountering them.

However, she could now endure multiple attacks. With each assault, she absorbed more tribulation energy, causing her aura to surge exponentially.

Right now, Lei Linger was even more terrifying than Huo Linger, thanks to the Saint aura enveloping her—a power granted by the Saint pill tribulations.

BOOM!

Eventually, Lei Linger reached her limit. She erupted into lightning runes, tightly securing the thunderforce, and retreated to the primal chaos space to gradually absorb it.

The Earth Cauldron then blazed with light, dispersing the tribulation clouds in the sky. At this moment, the Earth Cauldron seemed completely unmatched, and even heavenly tribulation was nothing more than a tool for refining pills to it. The Earth Cauldron could summon and dispel it at will.

After the Earth Cauldron returned to the primal chaos space, nine peerless grade Saint pills were reflected in Long Chen’s eyes. This was the thirty-sixth furnace of Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pills, and now, Long Chen was out of Sacred Light Pistils.

However, that was fine. He still had plenty of corpses to fuel the primal chaos space. The absorption of the five Saint corpses and the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was still underway. It wouldn’t be long before he accumulated another substantial batch of Sacred Light Pistils.

“It’s been hard on you, senior,” Long Chen remarked, gazing excitedly at the stack of Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pills.

“The hardship was well worth it. All the refinements have awakened seven of my core runes. I owe you my gratitude,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

Refining so many Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pills without pause had depleted a significant portion of Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength. He went without pause, relying on medicinal pills to replenish his energy.

Throughout the refinement process, the Earth Cauldron’s voice gained depth, signifying its growing power. It vaguely emitted the feeling of dominating heaven and earth. Finally, a glimpse of the formidable divine might of one of the ten great primal chaos divine items was unveiled.

Most importantly, this was just the tip of the iceberg. If it were to fully recover, who knew what kind of terrifying power it would possess?

Long Chen felt a sense of absolute security thanks to it. Also, refining the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pills was immensely beneficial to both Long Chen and the Earth Cauldron, as well as Lei Linger. The latter had finally eaten her fill, and with her mastery of Saint-tier lightning, her strength was now so formidable that even Long Chen felt a sense of alarm.

With the refinements completed and the second batch of Sacred Light Pistils yet to grow, the Earth Cauldron returned to Long Chen’s spiritual space to digest its gains.

Long Chen then started to consume these Saint pills one by one. Half a month later, he finished digesting over three hundred Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pills, and his cultivation base rose to the peak of the ninth Heavenstage of the World King realm.

If Long Chen were an ordinary person, he would be just one step away from entering the Divine Venerate realm. However, as he cultivated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he still had three more Heavenstages to break through.

The last three Heavenstages were the most difficult and required the most energy. Based on Long Chen’s estimate, to reach the peak of the twelfth Heavenstage, he would have to eat at least thirty thousand Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pills.

However, that was already excellent. Without the assistance of the Earth Cauldron, Long Chen would have had to rely on consuming World King Pills to progress, potentially requiring the ingestion of tens of millions of pills. The prospect of having to cram a mountain of pills into his stomach was too horrifying. He would definitely vomit blood after that.

Upon reaching the ninth Heavenstage, Long Chen felt disappointed for not awakening the eighth star’s pill formula. This concerned him deeply, as he didn’t know whether altering the course of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art had rendered him unable to unlock the remaining pill formulas.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

All he could do was console himself by entertaining the thought that he might unlock the next pill formula upon ascending to the rank of Divine Venerate. Emerging from seclusion after consuming the pills, Long Chen found that the Dragonblood Legion had come out as well.

They had all broken through to the ninth Heavenstage. However, they had advanced so quickly that their auras were a bit light, so they would need some time to solidify their new realms. If they were to make their breakthrough in this state, their heavenly tribulation would be extremely dangerous.

As a result, they had a rare chance to relax for a few days. Other than Xia Chen and Guo Ran who were working all the time, the rest of the Dragonblood warriors split up and roamed throughout the Esoteric Spirit World.

Under the influence of the holy tree, the entire Esoteric Spirit World had transformed into a paradise devoid of enemies—a pure sanctuary. It was even more relaxing and peaceful than the High Firmament Academy.

With a rare moment of leisure, Long Chen accompanied Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan, relishing this opportunity for relaxation and peace.

“Peaceful days are really nice. Just how great would it be if every day was like this?”

The three of them stared at a waterfall before them, its cascading waters releasing sparkling mist. Bathed in sunlight, a magnificent rainbow spanned between two mountains, captivating Yu Qingxuan’s gaze as she admired its beauty. Yu Qingxuan was content with simplicity and hated fighting. She would rather live a simple, peaceful life.

Seated in front of the waterfall, the trio immersed themselves in its beauty. Bai Shishi, however, countered Yu Qingxuan’s sentiment, shaking her head as she remarked, “We can’t vainly look for days like this. This world isn’t so beautiful. The only reason we are able to see this beautiful world is because others are shielding the shadows for us so that we can see the light.”

Hearing this, Long Chen was startled and looked at Bai Shishi in shock. He hadn’t expected Bai Shishi to be able to spout such a deep philosophy.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” demanded Bai Shishi somewhat angrily. That look in his eyes deserved a beating.

“You’ve grown up,” said Long Chen seriously.

“Scram!” Bai Shishi blushed and rebuked him. This might be praise, and Long Chen’s expression was also serious. However, his eyes were now on her chest, giving those words an entirely different meaning.

“Stop messing around. Long Chen, I have something serious to tell you. I’ve been nervous the last few days. I can somehow feel… it…” Yu Qingxuan’s tone turned solemn, a touch of fear permeating her words.

“What is it?” asked Long Chen.

“The Nether Emperor’s presence. I can sense it again.”

Immediately, Long Chen’s expression completely changed, and he shot up.
