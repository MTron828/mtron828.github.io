Chapter 4777 One Saber Annihilates Mortal Saint

At this moment, six runes of Split the Heavens activated on Evilmoon. They had been distributed in different places, but when Evilmoon slashed down, all six runes connected, forming a six-sided diagram.

The will of Split the Heavens unfurled when this diagram appeared, and Evilmoon was brimming with so much power that it could cut the entire world in two.

Long Chen and Evilmoon had managed to condense seven Split the Heavens runes. Although Long Chen tried to inscribe the eighth rune when he had some free time, he was unable to do so no matter how much he tried. The inscription would always be stopped and destroyed by Heavenly Dao energy, as if the heavens would not permit this rune to exist. After several tries, Long Chen was injured by the backlash and stopped trying.

As for the seven runes they did manage to create, Long Chen and Evilmoon repeatedly experimented with them. After many failures, they finally figured out the strongest method to merge them.

Long Chen ignited his dragon blood power, forming a resonance with Evilmoon. Within this perfect merger, he could merge all six forms into one to unleash unprecedented power.

Using all six forms at once was the limit of Long Chen’s dragon blood power. After all, this attack represented the strongest embodiment of his dragon blood power.

When this attack fell, the heavens seemed to weep, as though the world was afraid of it. This saber contained Long Chen’s unstoppable will—a decisiveness to succeed or die trying. Whoever tried to block it—man or god—would be annihilated. Even a Mortal Saint was shaken by the will of Long Chen’s Split the Heavens.

The black saber descended like a rain of stars. Evilmoon slammed into the sword-image, and with an explosive dragon cry, blood mist filled the air. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

BOOM!

The giant sword came flying out of the blood mist, transforming into a streak of light that instantly vanished.

“What?”

“What just happened?”

“Where is the Mortal Saint?!”

An uproar erupted. Whatever happened, it was so fast that they didn’t see it clearly. When they took a closer look, they found that the void was still twisting, so all they could see was blood mist. The Mortal Saint was nowhere to be found.

Another figure walked out of the blood mist, still with his saber on his shoulder and his cloak billowing behind him. His gaze seemed to look down on all others as he emerged before everyone.

“If I, Long Chen, want to kill someone, not even the heavens can shield them, let alone a little Mortal Saint,” Long Chen declared. His strides continued toward Yue Wuxu, mirroring the unyielding pace with which he had emerged from the Dragonblood Legion.

Everyone was silent. Looking at the blood mist scattered throughout the sky, they tried to force themselves to comprehend a terrifying fact: the Mortal Saint had truly met his end—body and soul obliterated.

The fact that even a Mortal Saint ould not impede Long Chen's advance, his very Yuan Spirit extinguished in a single strike, sent a shiver down the spectators’ spines.

At the beginning of the fight, people had said that Yue Wuxu was a supreme expert of the Celestial race, someone who could challenge Mortal Saints. That claim was actually a bit forced. While he might have held his ground against one for a time, victory was essentially out of reach.

However, Long Chen’s prowess transcended challenging Mortal Saints; he was capable of ending their lives. His ability to slay a Mortal Saint with a single strike surpassed everyone's expectations.

Even the Heaven Overseer was moved by this attack. He could tell that the strongest aspect of this attack was its destructive will.

Otherwise, no matter how strong Long Chen was, he would be unable to destroy a Mortal Saint’s Yuan Spirit. After all, their Yuan Spirit had undergone the baptism of Saint tribulation. Destroying the body was one thing, but destroying the Yuan Spirit, which was protected by the laws of the Heavenly Daos, was a feat beyond their comprehension. That could only be explained as Long Chen’s will exceeding that of the Heavenly Daos.

Typically, only those who had undergone the Saint tribulation could slay a Mortal Saint. Otherwise, while they might be able to destroy the body, they would falter against the invincible Yuan Spirit. This was why even after seeing the blood mist, many remained skeptical of the Mortal Saint's demise, waiting for the emergence of his Yuan Spirit.

This ferocious attack of Long Chen’s told everyone what a monster he was. He indeed could not be judged by normal standards.

This blow stunned everyone, especially Yue Wuxu. His seventh uncle was a Mortal Saint with a divine weapon, but he still couldn’t block an attack from Long Chen.

Seeing Long Chen walking toward him, Yue Wuxu felt like a death god was slowly approaching him. As he could smell death, terror filled his heart, causing him to tremble. He wanted to run, but he was so horrified that he couldn’t even move.

He was fully locked down. Actually, the lock on him had never faded from the moment Long Chen walked out of the Dragonblood Legion. Now, heavily wounded and bereft of his divine weapon, with his seventh uncle slain, his pillars of support had crumbled away. In front of Long Chen, he was like an ant without the slightest power to resist.

Just then, a yellow liquid trickled down his trouser leg, and expressions of scorn directly adorned the faces of all the experts around. Who would have imagined that the mighty genius of the Celestial race would piss himself in fear?

“As I’ve said before, all schemes are worthless in front of absolute power. If you had focused on cultivation instead of scheming all day, you would be stronger than you are now. Although, you still wouldn’t be a match for me, you might have had the slightest chance of fleeing with your life. I told you that no one could stop me from killing you today. Your blood will be my warning to this world that we are not prey. We have claws and fangs, so anyone who tries to devour us will pay a terrible price. Okay, that’s all I have to say. You can just kill yourself. At least, you’ll have an intact corpse that way. If I do it, you will be wiped out in body and soul,” said Long Chen coldly, pausing around three hundred meters from Yue Wuxu.

“Brat, you’re talking a bit too early, don’t you think?! Youngsters shouldn’t be too arrogant!”

Just then, a sneer rang out, accompanied by freezing air. Every expert present found that the space around them was compressed, as if they were buried in the earth. Even moving a single finger became incredibly difficult for them.

“This is...”

“An Earth Saint’s might!”

“An Earth Saint is descending!”

Startled cries rang out. Looking in the direction of that voice, they saw an elder wearing robes of the Celestial race walking toward Long Chen.

“An Earth Saint of the Celestial race has come!”

“He couldn’t be planning on attacking Long Chen, could he?”

“If so, the Celestial race would lose all face!”

Seeing this elder and sensing the apocalyptic pressure he exuded, many people had some questions.

Just like before, Long Chen still rested Evilmoon on his shoulder, and his blood-colored cloak fluttered behind him. Even in the face of an Earth Saint, he asked fearlessly, “Is someone even a youngster if they lack arrogance? Old fellow, are you trying to protect him?”

“I want to try it,” replied the elder, showing no signs of irritation as he walked toward Long Chen. “Allow me to take the place of your mother and father to teach you just how vast the heavens are.”

“Then allow me to show you the meaning of each generation surpassing the last!” Long Chen’s eyes turned ice-cold, his killing intent instantly surging to its peak.
