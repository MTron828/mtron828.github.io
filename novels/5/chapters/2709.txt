Chapter 2698 Heaven-Shaking Saber

Long Chen crazily assaulted Yun Shang, but the other four Sovereigns’ attacks also left him bloody. Every single attack possessed apocalyptic power, and parts of his body were repeatedly blown apart.

However, Long Chen was still fearless. The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees in the primal chaos space provided him with a huge amount of life energy. Unfortunately, all the damage was adding up, so their leaves were starting to turn yellow.

“Long Chen, you can’t be this rash. Use some strategy. I feel like Yun Tian’s words are correct,” transmitted Evilmoon.

In the beginning, Evilmoon truly had wished to target Yun Shang due to its hatred. Hence, the fact that Long Chen would target Yun Shang first made it very happy. However, when the five Sovereigns all joined hands, it became extremely taxing to fight them all this way. If this continued, they would really be in danger of being killed.

“No. Today, I must defeat Sovereign Yun Shang. This is a threshold that I must cross,” said Long Chen directly.

“What damn threshold? If it was a one against one, you definitely could suppress him. So you’ve already won!” exclaimed Evilmoon angrily. This stubbornness of his was truly vexing sometimes.

“Sovereign Yun Shang doesn’t have a physical body. As an imitation created by the Heavenly Daos, his power doesn’t match his real body. Furthermore, I now have your help. That means it’s basically a two against one. If I can’t beat him with these conditions, how am I supposed to walk my path in the future?” said Long Chen.

Evilmoon was speechless. Long Chen’s words were correct. These imitations of the Sovereigns were definitely not as strong as their true bodies back in the day. But they were still five Sovereigns. Who could beat them? Furthermore, Evilmoon had been refined into a weapon and no longer had access to many of the dark evil dragon race’s divine abilities.

“Now isn’t the time to show off. Your life is more important. You’ll definitely die like this,” persuaded Evilmoon.

Long Chen narrowly avoided Qing Xu’s attack but was struck by a zither string, which left a bloody line on his back. That thin line shattered his bones.

With a painful grunt, Long Chen swung Evilmoon, blocking Mo Li’s sword. He rapidly healed his wounds and once more charged at Yun Shang.

“You melon-headed donkey! You really will die like this!” raged Evilmoon in a panic. There was no medicine for this idiocy.

“Don’t get mad at me! Do you think that I want this? There’s no other option!” cursed Long Chen angrily.

“What?” asked Evilmoon.

“I… I can’t do anything about it. This is the will of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. It refuses to allow me to retreat,” raged Long Chen.

Treating Yun Shang as a threshold? Retreating midway wasn’t his style? That was bullshit.

When the five Sovereigns attacked together, the Pill Sovereign’s will, which had been dormant for a long time, suddenly burst out, forcing Long Chen to target the strongest Sovereign, Yun Shang.

He didn’t know if this was caused by him forcibly changing the latter path of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but when the Pill Sovereign’s will reappeared, he couldn’t refuse it.

Furthermore, with the Pill Sovereign’s memories merged with his own, it was difficult for him to tell what was his own will and what was the Pill Sovereign’s will.

Long Chen didn’t think that he was such a foolish person as to seek death in such a scenario. Thus, he deduced that this will had come from the Pill Sovereign.

Long Chen was capable of strategy, of following Yun Tian’s words and killing Zi Yang first, leaving more openings for fighting the remaining four Sovereigns.

However, once he betrayed this will, his own Undefeatable Dao-heart would crumble. It would be a crumbling of his own faith in himself, and that was a fatal blow to an expert.

Long Chen had bitterly kept this to himself, but Evilmoon’s pressing caused him to spit out this bitterness.

“That’s such a scam…” Evilmoon was also dumbfounded. What kind of cultivation technique was so domineering that it forced someone to die?

“Evilmoon, prepare yourself. After ten breaths, I will unleash my full power. Victory or defeat will be decided at that moment. As long as we beat Sovereign Yun Shang, everything else is basically settled,” transmitted Long Chen.

Lightning runes were circulating within Long Chen’s bones, a place that no one could see. All the attacks he received were being absorbed into those lightning runes.

After Lei Linger had taken human form, Long Chen didn’t summon her to fight the Sovereigns. Instead, he had her absorb their power within his body.

The Sovereigns were manifestations of lightning, not true physical bodies. Hence, their attacks contained thunderforce, and Lei Linger was rapidly absorbing it all.

Finally, Long Chen took a deep breath. After that, lightning wings spread on his back, growing larger and larger. Qing Xu, Mo Li, Han Wei, and Zi Yang were struck by the wings at the same time.

The four Sovereigns were sent flying as Long Chen seemed to suddenly transform into a god of lightning. As lightning raged around him, he slashed Evilmoon at Yun Shang. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Split the Heavens 9!”

His cry was like the roar of a celestial god, shaking the nine heavens. A saber-image tore into the sky, unleashing endless black mist and lightning runes.

The saber fell, shaking the world. This was an attack containing Long Chen’s entire heart and spirit. This was the attack he had wagered his life and death on.

Yun Shang smiled. “This is the most marvelous attack I’ve ever seen in my life. It cannot be blocked. Long Chen, I entrust the Martial Heaven Continent to you.”

BOOM!

The saber mercilessly slashed down, blasting apart Yun Shang’s body. He then transformed into divine runes that vanished into the void.

“Success!”

The Dragonblood warriors cheered, while Meng Qi and the others wept from joy.

Just as they were overwhelmed with joy, sword-light pierced through the void. Long Chen hastily dodged but was still struck in the shoulder. A piece of his flesh was cut off.

The heavenly tribulation had not ended. Sovereign Yun Shang was gone, but the other four Sovereigns remained.

Now when looking at Long Chen, everyone’s hearts clenched. In the Heavens’ Wrath state, Long Chen had used the ninth form of Split the Heavens, so his aura was plummeting, becoming extremely weak. It seemed that this attack had used up the majority of his energy.

A zither string slashed through the air, slicing the void in two. Long Chen hastily blocked it and ended up coughing up blood.

“Now what? Boss is out of energy!” Guo Ran and the others began to panic. Long Chen had paid a grave price to kill Sovereign Yun Shang.

Using Lei Linger to absorb the Sovereigns’ power, he had suddenly unleashed a blow to force the four of them back, giving him a hard-won opportunity. However, even though Sovereign Yun Shang was gone, the other four Sovereigns were even more dangerous to face in Long Chen’s current state.

“Big sister, do you really want to kill me?”

Long Chen suddenly smiled at the attacking Han Wei, who had an unwilling expression. However, her hand still moved, unleashing a zither string at Long Chen.

“Hehe, since big sister is being so vicious, don’t blame little brother for cheating.”

“Lightning domain, open!”

Suddenly, the void behind Long Chen exploded and a gigantic channel appeared. On the other side was a world of wild lightning.
