Chapter 2577 Controlling the Heavens’ Wrath

The old man suddenly descended from the sky and sent Bao Buping flying with his cane. Despite his age, he looked like a celestial god.

In the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, there was one rule. Whoever’s fist was bigger was who was right. The position of the sect master was based on power, not seniority.

“Old man, don’t regret those words! I’ve been holding back for a long time!”

Bao Buping turned toward the old man. Although he still had reverence in his eyes when he looked at the old man, he acted as if he didn’t care about that. His broadsword appeared in his hand, and he pointed it at the old man, shouting, “Take out your weapon! Don’t let others think I’m bullying you.”

Cheers erupted from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples. They all encouraged Bao Buping.

“Do I need a weapon to beat a little brat? You really think you’re something now. This cane is enough to beat the crap out of you,” said the old man disdainfully.

“Arrogant old man, do you think I’m still my old self? Take a look at the new me!”

Bao Buping then charged forward with his broadsword. At this moment, his manifestation appeared behind him, and a heavy pressure crashed down. Even Long Chen nodded inside.

Bao Buping was truly powerful. He could lock down his opponent with the will contained within his sword. Together, they became one with heaven and earth. This was one of the fundamental principles of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, and Bao Buping had mastered it perfectly.

“You still dare to not use your full power? You think I won’t be able to keep up?” The old man suddenly struck with his wooden cane. Quick as lightning, he had struck Bao Buping’s broadsword in three specific spots.

Bao Buping staggered as all his energy was instantly thrown out of balance. He reeled to the side, almost falling.

Long Chen saw it clearly. The old man had distorted the broadsword’s energy. He could disrupt an attack with less than a hundredth of the attack’s energy.

Long Chen already knew the result, so he shook his head. The old man had led the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect for a lifetime, and all the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s techniques were within him. There was no way Bao Buping could beat him.

“Old fellow, you have some skill. I won’t stand on courtesy then.” Bao Buping refused to admit defeat though. Since the old man had broken his technique so easily, he unleashed his full power. His manifestation rumbled, and a vast aura soared.

Bao Buping directly used his strongest attack, forcing the old man into a single exchange to decide victory or defeat.

As a result, just as he used this technique, the old man interrupted it. He appeared in front of Bao Buping, causing Bao Buping to curse, “Shameless old fellow!”

Bao Buping had no choice but to change techniques, resulting in him being sent tumbling back by the cane once more.

Bao Buping spat out some dirt. There was some blood in it. “If you have the guts, fight me like a man! We can have a competition of power against power!”

Bao Buping once more raised his sword to unleash the eighth form of Split the Heavens.

“Little brat, do you think that bit of superficial knowledge makes you qualified to be a sect master? I’ll show you the true Split the Heavens divine art.” The old man snorted and raised his cane, using it as a sword.

BOOM

Bao Buping coughed up three mouthfuls of blood and was sent flying back. The difference in power between the two was immense.

“Fuck, I refuse to believe this bullshit!” raged Bao Buping. They were clearly both fourth step Netherpassage experts, but he was still inferior to the old man.

Most infuriating of all, the old man hadn’t even summoned his manifestation. This made Bao Buping feel like he had lost all his prestige, so he charged back.

As a result, the old man did not spoil him. His wooden cane was like lightning, striking him all over. Despite Bao Buping alternating between furious roars and curses, he continued to fight.

Bao Buping was quickly covered in blood. The old man was ruthless. How was this teaching a child a lesson? Not even beasts of burden were beaten like this.

However, even as his skin was torn apart, Bao Buping refused to give up. He continued trying to win, but from start to end, he didn’t even manage to touch the old man’s clothes.

Chang Hao and the others twitched and involuntarily gulped. The old man was actually this powerful.

In the end, it was Long Chen who couldn’t bear to keep watching. He then pulled Bao Buping out in an opening.

“Old man, have some mercy,” advised Long Chen. If this continued, Long Chen didn’t know about any crap being beaten out, but the old man was definitely going to end up beating Bao Buping until he looked like a pile of crap.

“Fuck, this is bullshit! How can the difference be so great?!” cursed Bao Buping. His face was covered in blood.

He had tried countless times and failed every time. This showed him that there was still a huge gap between him and the old man.

“Long Chen, I can’t beat him, but I’ve given you a good start! The next one is you!” Bao Buping turned to Long Chen.

Was he trying to con him? Long Chen shoved Bao Buping aside. “Old man, nevermind. Just pretend I never came. Continue.”

“No! Long Chen, you can definitely beat him! Then the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect will be our world!” Bao Buping grabbed Long Chen, almost begging.

Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. After being beaten for so many years, this kid still didn’t learn his lesson.

“The old man’s divine might is incomparable. Even if I train for another twenty years, I won’t be a match for him. A person should know their own power. I feel like I should keep training first,” said Long Chen. He definitely didn’t want to go against the old man. The old man cared a great deal about face just like a child, so he didn’t want to offend him.

Bao Buping was about to speak again when the old man struck him in the butt once more. However, this time there wasn’t much power behind it, startling him.

The old man chortled, “Little fellow, not bad. You’re still able to retain your mind after being struck so many times. You’ve improved. Excellent, you can train in the ninth form of Split the Heavens with Long Chen.”

“The ninth form of Split the Heavens?!”

Everyone let out a startled cry, even Boss Bao and the others. “Old man, you’re going to transmit the ninth form of Split the Heavens? What about us?”

Boss Bao and the others instantly grew excited. They had waited for many years, but they had never gotten a chance.

“The seven of you can train with Long Chen, Buping, and Chang Hao. It just so happens that with so many people, you can gain experience from each other,” said the old man.

Boss Bao and the others instantly grew excited. Chang Hao was dancing.

The old man had the other disciples leave. As a result, some of those disciples started to protest. The old man simply said that anyone who could beat Bao Buping or Chang Hao could also come with them.

After hearing about this, about a dozen disciples who were especially close to the two of them started to think about how the two of them could let them slip in as well. They could easily pass this test with some help from the two of them…

However, the old man then said that if either of them were defeated, they would lose their qualifications to train in it. Hence, those people could only leave dejectedly.

Boss Bao and the others excitedly followed the old man to the rear mountains, to the old man’s wooden house. The old man then pushed open the door, revealing a transportation formation.

Boss Bao and the others were surprised. They had never realized that there was a transportation formation here.

The formation activated, and they appeared in a world of fire. It was as if they were in lava. A violent aura hung in the air.

“This is the world inside the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. However, due to half of it still missing, this world is not very stable. The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet is the crux for training in the ninth form of Split the Heavens. Without it, there is no way to train in it. Forcing it will only result in death. That’s why I never allowed you to train in it. Furthermore, the difference in our realms is also because of the ninth form of Split the Heavens,” said the old man.

He waved his hand, causing divine light to fall from the sky. Long Chen and the others suddenly felt as if they were bound by chains.

The old man continued, “The ninth form is different from the previous eight forms. It is said that when trained to the pinnacle, it can slay immortals and slaughter gods. However, the stronger the technique, the more difficult it is to train in it. It is also more dangerous. Without the assistance of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, we have to be even more careful. One mistake, and no one can save you.”

“We know, hurry up. How- ow!” Bao Buping was beaten once more due to his impatience.

“With that kind of attitude, there is no way you can train in the ninth form. Do you think I’m just saying these things for fun?” raged the old man.

Bao Buping became much more obedient. He glared but didn’t say anything.

“Pay attention. The first step to learning the ninth form is to master the Heavens’ Wrath,” said the old man.

Suddenly, the old man’s manifestation appeared behind him. Following that, a berserk pressure crashed down upon them.

Boss Bao and the others instantly turned pale. This pressure contained endless fury, which couldn’t be faked. It was true anger. The old man was looking at them as if there was a blood sea of hatred between them.

In that instant, they felt as if they were facing a berserk god. They didn’t dare to move. It was as though if they dared to move even a little bit, the old man would really kill them.

The old man’s aura became icy and merciless. Although he didn’t take out his sword, Boss Bao and the others were already soaked in sweat. They didn’t even dare to blink.

“Old man… you wouldn’t really be wanting to kill us, right?” asked Boss Bao nervously.
