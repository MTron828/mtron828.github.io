Chapter 3527

Long Chen arrived, still wearing the same black robes and carrying the Minghong Saber on his back. Countless people’s gazes were on him.

His appearance startled quite a few people because they assumed that Long Chen had stealthily fled.

After all, he was being targeted by so many terrifying experts. If Long Chen didn’t want to die, then he would definitely run.

Now that he had appeared, they were shocked by his guts and started to admire him. Whether or not he could leave the Heavenly Flame World in one piece, that arrogance of his had definitely given people a newfound level of respect for him.

Wu Yang, Zhao Mingxuan, and a few others smiled cruelly when they saw him. They already viewed him as prey.

“Interesting. In one month, you forcibly raised your cultivation base from the first Heavenstage of the Divine Lord realm to the fourth Heavenstage. To rise three realms in one month is truly surprising. But even so, Long Chen, you can’t escape your fate of being slaughtered today,” sneered Zhao Mingxuan.

Amongst the rest of them, even the weakest cultivation base was someone at the seventh Heavenstage. As for Zhao Mingxuan, he was at the ninth Heavenstage. He could completely suppress Long Chen in terms of realm.

Long Chen ignored Zhao Mingxuan. It was like he didn’t see any of them, and he looked at Yu Qingxuan who appeared at the same time as him. The two of them exchanged a smile.

“In a month, you managed to rise three realms. That’s amazing.” Yu Qingxuan was pleasantly surprised to see Long Chen’s cultivation base. His aura was vast like a sea and exceptionally steady. There were no signs of it being hollow or unstable. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It had to be known that the Divine Lord realm was comparatively slow in progress. To rise three realms in just a month would be like plucking out sprouts to make them grow taller. It would definitely cause an unstable foundation.

However, there were no signs of such a thing in Long Chen’s aura. That made Yu Qingxuan click her tongue in wonder. She was happy for him.

“The wine of the Wine God Palace isn’t famous for nothing. That senior with the ruler qi in particular, his wine is especially miraculous,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Long Chen had combined medicinal pills and wine during this time. With the two of them helping each other, with the right arrangement, it was possible to draw out each other’s potential and increase both of their effects.

Furthermore, since he was in the early stage of the realm, his progression was naturally faster. If it weren’t for the fact that advancing to the Divine Lord realm had caused his body to change immensely, causing him to need to stabilize it first, he could have long since reached the late stage by crazily consuming medicinal pills.

Now, his body had essentially stabilized. With the help of the Wine God Palace’s wine, in truth, he had advanced to the fourth Heavenstage seven days ago.

However, he didn’t continue advancing. Once his cultivation base rose to the fourth Heavenstage, the astral power of his 108,000 stars explosively grew.

During this time, Long Chen had also been consuming Violet Tower pills. As a result, the Alioth Star had become completely violet. Moreover, the star clouds around his 108,000 stars were denser, and their violet qi was more solid.

From outside, Long Chen’s Dantian appeared to be a star sea. The violet qi was like auspicious clouds floating between the stars, containing a mysterious energy. When the violet qi entered his stars, Long Chen understood just how powerful this star sea was.

With the nourishment of the violet qi, these stars seemed to obtain new life. As they began to transform, every star became like the mouth of a spring, with power gushing out endlessly for Long Chen’s use. As for the violet qi, it was precisely the key to activating these springs.

Furthermore, this violet qi didn’t just bring him divine flame energy, as it contained spiritual yuan as well. Adding on his original stores of spiritual yuan that had explosively grown after advancing, he was no longer worried about running out of spiritual yuan.

This time, when Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen, she saw that his gaze was full of ease and confidence. Even against this endless army of experts, he was like a calm lake, with not even a ripple on the surface.

“That senior really is amazing.” When this person was mentioned, Yu Qingxuan nodded. That elder seemed to be from the same generation as her master. Hence, his origins were definitely frightening.

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan walked shoulder to shoulder. One in black robes and the other in a black dress; a handsome man and a beautiful woman. They were like a golden couple that had descended from the heavens. It was unknown just how many jealous gazes glared at the two of them at that moment.

Fairy Qingxuan’s name had long since spread throughout the Violet Flame Heaven. Whether it was her background, her looks, or her talent, she was a peak heavenly chosen, someone who toppled over countless elites.

Hence, for Long Chen to now be standing alongside her, laughing and talking while whispering secretly with her, many people almost had flames burst out of their eyes.

Fairy Qingxuan was said to be the Blazing Murasaki Flower. The idea that this flower might land in someone’s home was something countless people had daydreamed about. Countless handsome youngsters were pursuing her.

However, while Yu Qingxuan’s character was warm, she was only politely courteous to everyone and had yet to get close to anyone. It was precisely due to this that those young men had kept their dreams, thinking that they still had a chance.

Therefore, for Long Chen to suddenly appear and swirl away fairy Qingxuan, who kept others at a polite distance, it was like he had bewitched her. They had never seen her talk and laugh with someone like this.

Long Chen had essentially crushed the flame of hope in countless people’s hearts. How could they not be enraged?

The most infuriated man here was Zhao Mingxuan. He had directly threatened Long Chen, and the latter simply ignored him, treating him as nothing more than thin air. It was a silent insult that was even harder to bear than a direct one.

And yet, he couldn’t directly turn against Long Chen because Long Chen was talking with Yu Qingxuan. If he interrupted him now, it would offend Yu Qingxuan.

He wanted to kill Long Chen but didn’t want to offend Yu Qingxuan. This was all to keep a trace of that dream alive. Anyway, he also couldn’t offend Yu Qingxuan’s background.

For Yu Qingxuan to arrive with Long Chen, she had essentially added another halo around Long Chen, making countless experts jealous, yet unable to express it.

When they arrived at the Heavenly Flame World’s gates, Long Chen sensed countless sharp gazes filled with killing intent. Looking over, he saw that it was a group of masked, cloaked lifeforms.

“Long Chen, you killed millions and millions of members of my race! Your hands are dyed in their blood! Good, I’m glad I got to meet you here!” One of those lifeforms slowly took off his mask.

When he took off his mask, startled cries rang out. Expressions of terror appeared on countless people’s faces.

He had bull horns on his head and eyes like golden lanterns. When he spoke, golden sparks flew out. The laws of the Heavenly Daos actually began to twist around him. Moreover, flames began to appear around his body after he took off his mask. The temperature in the air instantly rose.

“Golden eyes! The Immemorial Flame Devil!”

A startled cry rang out as someone recognized this lifeform. It was a member of the devil race, and it was one possessing an immemorial bloodline. He actually didn’t even wait for the gates to open, instead showing his true face right outside. As a result, people stared in shock at Long Chen.
