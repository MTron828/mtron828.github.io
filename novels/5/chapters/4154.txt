Chapter 4143: Besieged by Heaven Venerates

“I knew that you would try to do this. But you’re too naive. Do you think that you can take advantage of Boss Long San?”

Long Chen sneered. He had long since been ready for Xue Qingkuang’s group.

At this moment, over ten blood-red swords tore through the void at Long Chen. Xue Qingkuang no longer cared about dignity or honor. Even if he had to be given the title of a coward who ganged on someone, he had to subdue Long Chen first.

After all, Long Chen had not just scammed them of their priceless treasure, but he had also taken the spear and the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse. If they couldn’t subdue him now, by the time that the surrounding people did, they would have no more chance.

“A group of ants dares to run wild in front of Boss Long San?”

Long Chen swung the golden spear. Even in front of so many experts, he was fearless.

“Don’t fight him directly!”

Countless experts swarmed him, and among them was the leader of the Blood Devil race who shouted a warning.

However, his warning didn’t come as fast as Long Chen’s counterattack. The golden spear already swung in the air, striking Xue Qingkuang and the others’ swords.

As a result, all of their swords shattered upon contact with the spear. Those swords were the Blood Devil race’s innate divine weapons, but they were like children’s toys in front of the golden spear.

Including Xue Qingkuang, all the attackers hacked up blood and tumbled back, while quite a few of them clenched their heads and let out pained groans.

It had to be known that their weapons were similar to the Fullmoon race’s, which were their innate horns that were condensed into weapons. As a result, the destruction of their swords also damaged their souls.

Moreover, they had been accumulating all their power for a long time. As the destruction of their swords rendered all that accumulated energy without an escape, their inner qi plunged into disarray.

Fortunately, they were all top experts with immense combat experience. As they tumbled back, they let their power dissipate out of their bodies. If they had missed that step, their bodies would have directly exploded.

“Tch, a group of trash, unable to endure even a single blow. With this spear in my hand, you tiny Blood Devils are no more than ants. You dare to brandish your claws in front of Boss Long San? Did you feel like your life is too long?” Long Chen pointed the spear at Xue Qingkuang and the others, looking incredibly arrogant.

Just then, countless experts arrived on the battlefield, and some of them were innate Heaven Venerates. With the Great Desolate Winged Devil's corpse now gone, the constraining pressure had dissipated, allowing them unrestricted access to this region.

“Tch, you want to kill me for my treasures? It will depend on whether you have the ability.” Long Chen rested the spear on his shoulder fearlessly.

The first one to arrive was the Blood Devil race’s leader. He was incredibly fast and also reacted one step faster than the others. As his claw extended toward Long Chen, a dense surge of devil qi erupted, carrying an overwhelming devilish aura. Recognizing the strength of Long Chen's spear, he refrained from clashing with a weapon and instead opted for the Blood Devil race's divine technique. He thought that even with such a formidable spear, Long Chen would find it difficult to withstand this kind of attack.

BOOM!

Nevertheless, the devil claw had barely materialized before it was shattered by a beam of divine light. Xu Jianxiong had also joined the fray. Luckily, he had readied himself in advance, and his swiftness matched that of the Blood Devil race's leader.

“Courting death! Are you challenging the Blood Devil race to war?!”

“If you want war, I’ll accompany you. Why waste so many words?” retorted Xu Jianxiong domineeringly.

Suddenly, the earth exploded and countless roots burst out of the ground, piercing into the sky. Caught off-guard by this, many Heaven Venerates were thrown into disarray.

At this moment, a giant dragon tree took root, its crown covering the heavens and its branches resembling coiled dragons. Following this, the undying qi rose, shaking the ten thousand Daos. Uncle Tree had summoned his true body, as he knew that he needed to shake these opponents. Otherwise, it would be troublesome.

The might of the Undying Dragon Tree unfurled, shrouding them in an unending veil of death qi. The current Uncle Tree was like a monster baring its fangs. His murderous aura caused heaven and earth to change color. This was the unmistakable power of the Undying race.

The Undying race instilled trepidation and even fear in countless other races, for their awe-inspiring vitality could genuinely be termed as undying.

Their power was already terrifying, but their most terrifying aspect was when they burned away their own lives in exchange for greater power.

That was a sacrificial move that could easily cause their death. But in that state, their power would multiply by several to even dozens of times.

Uncle Tree was precisely in this kind of state, his aura instantly shaking everyone. As a result, they didn’t dare to force him too far. After probing his aura, even an innate Heaven Venerate sensed immense danger and instinctively retreated.

“Anyone who dares to harm my master, my Undying Dragon Tree race will definitely fight them to the death!” Uncle Tree’s voice was icy and filled with killing intent.

At this moment, an Undying Dragon Tree covered the heavens, causing everyone to feel tiny in front of it. Seeing this spectacle, the experts hoping to take advantage of this opportunity hesitated.

“How laughable. We have so many Heaven Venerates on our side. If we all attack at once, how will the two of you stop us?” A cold sneer rang out.

Long Chen looked at the speaker, and it was actually that innate Heaven Venerate from the Soaring Dragon Company. He had unexpectedly come here as well.

He was truly evil, intentionally encouraging everyone to attack. As expected, quite a few people grew itchy upon hearing that.

With over ten innate Heaven Venerates against them, one member of the Fullmoon race and one Undying Dragon Tree would not make much difference.

After all, for the enemies, there was no need to fight the two of them to death. They just needed to capture Long Chen, and it was a done deal.

They were even more excited when they remembered the three priceless treasures in Long Chen’s possession: the Eternal divine spear, the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse, and the bronze cauldron suspected to be the Heaven Earth Cauldron. The allure of such treasures was incredibly difficult to resist.

“Who can say for sure? But I want to try it,” said Uncle Tree, his voice echoing throughout heaven and earth.

Suddenly, that innate Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company sensed something below him, his expression changing completely. After that, he vanished in the blink of an eye.

BOOM!

The instant he vanished, a wooden thorn pierced through the earth where he was, and it was just the tiniest bit away from striking him. From this, it was proof that the attack of the Undying Dragon Tree was truly fast. Even an innate Heaven Venerate was barely able to keep up with it.

“AH!”

Just as everyone thought that this Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company had managed to escape, they heard him scream, so they looked toward the sky. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

They were shocked to see that he was bound by countless dragon-shaped branches, unable to escape.

Long Chen then pointed the golden spear at him, and he cried out in terror.

“No!”

BANG!

All of a sudden, golden light flashed, and an arrow pierced through his head.
