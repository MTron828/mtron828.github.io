Chapter 2592 The Wolf God’s Egg

“Devil Lord!”

Seeing the Devil Lord coughing up some blood, the seven Sovereign sprouts cried out in shock. The Devil Lord was an unrivaled existence in their minds, but he had actually been injured.

At this moment, the blood that he spat out instantly froze, and a terrifying Ice Qi somehow covered the valley in ice, stunning the seven Sovereign sprouts.

“That woman’s sword is a world divine item. Although she can’t use its full power, my own energy automatically provoked a trace of its energy. Tch, if it weren’t for that world divine item, they would have all died,” said the Blood Fiend Devil Lord darkly.

“Devil Lord, your back is injured…” said one of the Sovereign sprouts. There was a wound on his back that was still bleeding.

These people were his followers, and they knew just how terrifying he was. However, they had never seen him injured before. Right now, black blood was constantly flowing out of that wound, and it emitted a dense sinister aura.

“It was that assassin girl’s dagger. It contains a god’s curse, so be careful around her. If you get stabbed, your essence blood will bleed out in an instant. However, that god is no big figure to be feared. It is that ice sword that is troublesome. Tell everyone not to rashly make any moves. Once the Martial Heaven Continent is fully infected by our world’s aura, we will settle things with the human race,” said the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

“Yes.”

“Devil Lord, isn’t just waiting bad for our morale?” asked one of them.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord snorted. “That thinking of yours is very foolish. Do you know why I killed those old fellows? It’s because they were just as stupid. Giving a show of power to the Martial Heaven Continent is meaningless. The continent has reached the end of its lifespan, and they are at their wit’s end. Those old fellows of the Martial Heaven Continent are definitely aware of this. Moreover, the most frightening thing about the human race is their unity. A powerful enemy will only cause them to band together. Unless you have enough power to cause absolute despair, there’s no point in provoking them. Those old fellows were foolish to that extent. If it weren’t for their bloodlines, I’d even suspect that they were spies from the human race trying to raise the human race’s morale. But I didn’t think that you are also that stupid. If you weren’t my guard, I’d kill you as well. Even after following me for so many years, you haven’t grown a brain.”

That Sovereign sprout turned pale with terror. After that, he hastily knelt down and kowtowed in apology. The other guards were silent as well.

“Is there any movement from the wolf god’s egg?” asked the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

“Reporting to the Devil Lord, the wolf god’s egg is exceptionally active at the moment. The ancestral runes are being absorbed. Therefore, it is most likely receiving the inheritance and will quickly break out of its shell,” reported one of the Sovereign sprouts.

“Good. I have high expectations for a wolf god incubated for over a hundred thousand years.” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord smiled. He suddenly rose. “My source energy was damaged, and I need to recover. During my absence, go find another Sovereign sprout. After Xue Ka died, a new Sovereign sprout will be born. Find him.”

“Yes.” All the Sovereign sprouts nodded.

Looking content, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord vanished with a quiver of his blood sun. After that, the Sovereign sprouts quickly got to work.

Deep within the Yin Yang World, within a deep valley surrounded by mountains, a giant egg that was thrumming with Blood Qi could be seen. The void around it was filled with cracks and flying runes. Wild lightning, wind blades, and burning flames crackled around it.

The shell of the egg had reached a semi-transparent state. From the outside, it was vaguely possible to see a curled-up, snow-white figure. A scarlet ball of light on its forehead was pulsing like fire.

As it slumbered within the egg, the runes outside were absorbing the world’s energy for it. The runic chains within the egg were sending it an unending current of energy.

Despite still being asleep, with every breath it took, the laws of heaven and earth moved with it. It was as if it was a slumbering god who could bring forth destruction upon worlds once it awoke.

…

At this moment, the news of the Dragonblood Legion’s battle against the Blood Fiend Devil Lord instantly spread throughout the Martial Heaven Continent. All the main characters of the Dragonblood Legion had appeared other than Long Chen, but they still couldn’t stop the Blood Fiend Devil Lord from retreating. Because of this, he instantly became the continent’s nightmare.

Even the people’s confidence in Long Chen was shaken by the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. That was just how powerful he was.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord could charge onto the continent and fight the top experts of the Dragonblood Legion. He was then able to safely retreat. Since this was the case, there was no way to describe just how terrifying he was.

In comparison, Long Chen had been forced to rely on Daoist Heavenly Feather’s protection when he had entered the Yin Yang World. Just that one bit of fact made quite a few people assume that Long Chen was not a match for the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

Most importantly, the seal on Devil Spirit Mountain was slowly fading, and the devil qi inside was starting to flow onto the continent as well.

The divine families had vanished without a word. It was impossible to tell what they were thinking. Perhaps Long Chen had infuriated them and they did not wish to interfere in the matters of the Martial Heaven Continent any longer.

In any case, the people of the Martial Heaven Continent felt very anxious. Despite that, Long Chen did not show himself.

BOOM!

In the rear mountains of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, everything had been turned into a desert of sand and gravel.

“How many times have I told you, you have to control your anger! You can only unleash your power once it stabilizes, or if you only seek greater power, it will cause damage to your own body. When the wounds that you cannot sense slowly accumulate over time, you’ll be a cripple before you even reach a hundred years old!” roared the old man until his throat felt hoarse. It was unknown how many times he had shouted.

Within the flying sand and dust was Long Chen who was wielding Evilmoon. He was facing the old man.

In the distance, Bao Buping, Chang Hao, and the seven bosses were lying in the sand, too tired to move. Even as the wind half buried them with sand, they didn’t twitch.

They were all too exhausted as the training with the old man had been hellish. They felt like their bodies would simply fall apart at any moment.

Of them all, only Long Chen was still standing. Even the old man was panting like an old bull.

Long Chen felt a bit helpless. “I really can’t. Just let me do it like this. I have a different cultivation technique, so I can’t reach that balance. If I get some hidden wounds, then fine. I have my own ways to recover. I feel like I’ve gotten a sense of the ninth form of Split the Heavens. My path is different than yours, so don’t make things hard on me.”

Long Chen cultivated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, the most domineering and direct cultivation technique. Although the Battle God Sacred Canon was similar to it, there was a trace of softness within it, and that was the crux for the ninth form of Split the Heavens. It was what prevented a giant backlash from killing the user.

As for the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, it lacked any such softness. Every attack was an all-out attack. After a long time, even a body of metal would break apart from such a thing. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As an example, whether a stonemason was using a wooden or metal hammer, there had to be some flexibility, some elasticity. This softness was what allowed the hammer to break stone over and over again.

Without that softness, every attack would damage oneself, which meant the more power that Long Chen used, the greater the backlash. That was not how the ninth form of Split the Heavens should be used, and that was why the old man was angry and anxious.

“How can a man simply accept such drivel? Little Bao, get over here and demonstrate. I refuse to believe that I can’t teach you this!” shouted the old man.

Boss Bao’s body twitched in the sand. He raised his head, almost crying. “Old man, spare us. It’s been three days. Can you at least let us stay alive and keep breathing?”

In order to teach Long Chen this softness, not only had Long Chen been forced to endure the old man’s harsh teachings, but Boss Bao and the others had become teaching instruments, with the old man constantly using them to get Long Chen to learn.

As a result, Boss Bao and the others had fallen into an endless hell. Every time they used the ninth form of Split the Heavens, they exhausted themselves. Even after they had all demonstrated once, Long Chen hadn’t learned anything. As for the old man, he refused to give up.

“Stop wasting words. Get up. If an old man like me can stay standing, aren’t you embarrassed to be lying down?” demanded the old man.

“You have the Heaven Splitting Blade. You’re not even using five percent of the energy we’re using. Aren’t you embarrassed to say such a thing? If you want, give me the Heaven Splitting Blade and we’ll see who is too tired to stand!” raged Boss Bao.

“You… you’re looking for a beating, hm?” The old man was at a loss for words. It truly was the Heaven Splitting Blade that allowed him to stay standing so easily.

“Don’t waste the effort. Long Chen cannot use this kind of soft energy because his Nine Star Hegemon Body Art will not allow any sense of retreat.” Finally, Evilmoon spoke up again.

“Impossible. Once reaching the limit of one extreme, the only direction is to go back. There are no absolutes in this world. Softness and hardness intertwine. Without softness, there is no hardness,” said the old man, refusing to believe this.

“The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is precisely like that. If Long Chen tries to find a roundabout way because he's afraid of being injured, it will be a betrayal to the essence of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Even Long Chen’s character has been affected by that cultivation technique to this extent. Are you not clear on that? Don’t waste time,” said Evilmoon indifferently.

“Reporting to sect master, the alliance head has come and wishes to speak to you. She says that there’s something important to discuss.” Just at this moment, a disciple of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect ran over.
