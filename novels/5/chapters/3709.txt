Chapter 3698 Vermilion Bird Empire, Imperial Princess?

“Qingxuan, over here!”

Long Chen waved both of his hands at Yu Qingxuan excitedly. 

Today’s Yu Qingxuan had her hair in two buns, which weren’t all that high and were in the shape of a butterfly. The rest of her hair fell to her waist. Coupled with her white dress that was untouched by the slightest dust, she looked like a heavenly fairy that had fallen into the mortal world.

When she spotted Long Chen on the upper floor of the restaurant, her eyes lit up. She enthusiastically waved back to Long Chen, smiling beautifully. Her smile was irreplicable.

Long Chen wanted to invite her up, but Yu Qingxuan had hundreds of people behind her, so he hesitated.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This restaurant might be tall, but it wasn’t that wide. If so many people came up at once, it would be too packed. Furthermore, one floor wouldn’t be able to fit them all. It would look a bit awkward.

“Go. I’ll just drink here peacefully. Speaking of which, you have to settle the bill first. I don’t have any money on me.” Xia Guhong read Long Chen’s thoughts and smiled.

“Then big brother, just drink here comfortably. Us brothers will drink again later.” Long Chen smiled and rushed out after paying. He then arrived in front of Yu Qingxuan.

“Fairy Qingxuan’s splendor is the same as ever, but your beauty has only grown. Moreover, both your demeanor and talents make great strides forward since our last parting. It’s truly worthy of celebration!” Long Chen’s heart was full of warmth now that he was seeing Yu Qingxuan again.

Yu Qingxuan laughed at Long Chen’s words. His words were too exaggerated. Despite knowing that he was just teasing her, she couldn’t help laughing.

“Don’t you think that if a dean talks like this, others will laugh at you?” Yu Qingxuan smiled at Long Chen.

“I’m just telling the truth. If someone dares to laugh, I’ll just slap them. Of course, you don’t count. Yes, you don’t count!” Midway through, Long Chen realized that Yu Qingxuan was also laughing, so he hastily corrected himself.

That flustered appearance of Long Chen only made Yu Qingxuan laugh more. As for the disciples standing behind her, they were all bewildered by the laughing Yu Qingxuan. They had never seen her so happy before.

It had to be known that while Yu Qingxuan was normally warm and gentle, she was also dignified and composed. Although it wasn’t to the point of never laughing or smiling, there was always a certain dignity when she spoke to others. Hence, her current happy appearance was extremely shocking to them.

“Long Chen, if you have guts, come out and fight!”

Long Qinian stood in the air, shouting at Long Chen. He finally knew Long Chen’s name and directly challenged him.

“What’s going on? Have you provoked another calamity?” Yu Qingxuan looked at the enraged Long Qinian and then looked at Long Chen curiously. She had only come because she heard Long Chen’s voice. She didn’t know what had just happened.

“What do you mean by another calamity? It was this fellow whose mouth was unclean. He was rude to big brother Xia Guhong, so I just slapped him in the face. There’s nothing else that I could do!” exclaimed Long Chen helplessly.

“Senior Xia Guhong is also here?! Last time, I didn’t know that he was friends with my master, so I didn’t greet him properly. Long Chen, please bring me to see senior Xia Guhong now! I have to apologize!” said Yu Qingxuan hastily.

When she went to the Wine God Palace with Long Chen, she met and talked with Xia Guhong. But only later did she learn that this expert possessing ruler qi was actually the famous monarch of the Grand Xia. She was then filled with shock and admiration.

Xia Guhong and Luo Qingying’s love story was a sad and regretful one. However, in order to avenge Luo Qingying, Xia Guhong had charged into the devil world and slaughtered a legion of devils, gaining countless people’s respect.

After hearing about this feat, many women dreamed of having someone who loved them as much as Xia Guhong loved his beloved, and Yu Qingxuan wasn’t an exception. She was shocked when she knew that Xia Guhong was the idol that she respected.

“What apology? That’s our big brother! Don’t call him senior in the future. Otherwise, the seniority will get messed up,” laughed Long Chen.

Yu Qingxuan blushed slightly. These words were far too direct, especially when said in front of so many people. She glared at Long Chen a bit angrily.

“Princess, who is this person? His words are quite careless. Please pay attention to your status.” At this moment, an elder behind Yu Qingxuan coldly spoke up.

Long Chen was startled. Princess? When did Yu Qingxuan become a princess? Long Chen then looked at the elder and realized that he was a half-step Divine Venerate.

He wore imperial robes, and on his belt, there was a tablet with a phoenix design on it.

This person looked to be around forty. His face was white and hairless, and his voice was sharp and thin. His jaw was also a bit raised, giving off a feeling like he was constantly looking down on others.

Long Chen was first confused, but then an expression of disbelief appeared in his eyes. This person was actually a eunuch. This soft and feminine air was something that Long Chen could not be mistaken about. He hadn’t thought that there were any eunuchs in the immortal world.

“Oh, eunuch Wei, let me introduce you. This is my friend, Long Chen. He is the youngest dean in all of the High Firmament Academy’s history. He also saved my life in the Heavenly Flame World, so I owe him an immense debt.” Yu Qingxuan seemed to be a bit restrained when it came to this eunuch Wei. She quickly introduced them.

Long Chen felt some distaste for his soft and greasy aura. However, in order to give face to Yu Qingxuan, he nodded to eunuch Wei.

As for this eunuch Wei, he didn’t respond with any courtesy. Instead, he eyed Long Chen up and down before coldly saying, “I don’t care what status you have. I just wish for you to know that Qingxuan is the princess of the Vermilion Bird Empire. She possesses the respected Jiuli bloodline, and not just anyone can get close to her. We will not limit the princess’s choice in making friends, but I hope that sir can reserve your actions a bit. The Vermilion Bird Empire’s dignity must be protected.”

His tone was extremely rude, clearly reprimanding Long Chen. Hence, Long Chen’s expression immediately grew ugly. He had never managed to swallow such an insult.

Did a damn eunuch really dare to be so arrogant in front of him? Looking at his arrogant expression, Long Chen truly had the urge to slap him. He would teach this idiot that Boss Long San had a temper.

However, he was also worried that Yu Qingxuan would be unhappy with him if he beat this eunuch. When it came to Yu Qingxuan, Long Chen was filled with guilt. He had sworn to repay her for everything, so he didn’t want her to be hurt in the slightest.

Even so, Long Chen could already feel that he was starting to lose control due to this hairless fellow.

“Long Chen, I’m sorry. Eunuch Wei was sent by my imperial father. I… I can’t do anything about him. Endure it for now. Once we enter the three thousand worlds, we won’t have to bother with him.” Yu Qingxuan hastily messaged Long Chen spiritually when she saw his expression.

At such a young age, Long Chen already sat in the position of the High Firmament Academy’s dean. He had swept through the heavenly geniuses of various races within the Heavenly Flame World and even slaughtered the seniors that came to avenge them. Just how domineering was such an existence?

Seeing him being chided, Yu Qingxuan was extremely apologetic, but there was nothing that she could do about eunuch Wei. She could only apologize for putting him in this situation.

“Long Chen, are you mute?!”

BOOM!

Long Qinian had challenged Long Chen twice, only for Long Chen to treat him like empty space. He was even chatting with Yu Qingxuan and eunuch Wei. Seeing this scene, Long Qinian was enraged.

Suddenly, he shot through the air, a spear appearing in his hand. When a dragon cry rang out, everyone jumped. They saw him piercing his spear at Long Chen.

“Perfect!” Seeing Long Qinian suddenly attacking, Long Chen had a thought and glanced at the arrogant eunuch Wei. He had found his chance.
