Chapter 4592 We Can’t Last Much Longer

“Big brother Long Chen...!”

When Long Chen walked into the channel, he staggered and almost fell. Lei Linger and Huo Linger hastily supported him, their faces filled with worry.

“I’m fine. I just didn’t expect to be so exhausted after using the Purgatory Eyes this time,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen found it curious. Unlike previous instances when he used the Purgatory Eyes, this time he hadn’t been pressed as hard. In theory, using this technique shouldn't have incurred such a heavy toll, but it appeared that he had unintentionally overdrafted his own energy.

“Is it because of him?”

Long Chen connected this to his heart-devil. Ever since its disappearance, he had always felt like something was a bit off. This time, when he used the Purgatory Eyes, he noticed a real drop in his power.

Somehow, he started to miss his heart-devil a bit. If his heart-devil were here, perhaps he could have taken away the net.

Suddenly, a splitting headache overwhelmed Long Chen, and stars danced in his vision. He hadn’t felt anything before, but the minute he exited his combat state, weariness attacked him. He felt like he was about to collapse.

Long Chen didn’t dare to show any weakness though. Although he had left the Netherdragon race’s territory, he had to go past quite a few dragon nests to reach the white dragon race’s nest. If he were to seem too weak, someone might attack him.

To get here, he had beaten up anyone who had dared to block his way. If they were to learn that he had lost his combat strength, it would be strange if they didn’t attack him.

Long Chen gritted his teeth and acted like he was fine. With Lei Linger and Huo Linger protecting his sides, he passed through one nest after another.

On his way back, he found that all the experts in these nests were staring at him vigilantly. Some were even clenching their weapons with quivering hands..

Long Chen hadn’t expected them to be more nervous than him, but he suddenly understood. The spectators of his battle had likely transmitted the events of his clash with the Netherdragon race through their bloodlines to their own kin.

Just now, Long Chen had essentially wiped out the Netherdragon race, and the only survivor was Netherdragon Tianzhao who had fled into the ancestral scale’s space.

Such an event was rare in dragon race’s history, so how could they not feel apprehensive?

After all, Netherdragon Tianzhao was publicly accepted as someone on par with the dragon domain’s top ten, possibly even among the top five heavenly geniuses. The whole Netherdragon race had also been accumulating power for countless years. After gathering their elites, Netherdragon Tianzhao even declared that he would subdue the Sovereign clan’s ancestral scale and unify the dragon domain. Sadly, the bold declaration aged like milk.

Long Chen had single handedly decimated Netherdragon Tianzhao’s faction, leaving them all in shock. Also, when these people looked at Long Chen, they could feel the ominous presence of the dragon’s curse emanating from him. This curse was the accumulated resentment of dragon experts slain by his hand.

Long Chen’s air of resentment was frighteningly dense, especially for the dragon experts, which was why their reaction toward him was so intense. When they saw Long Chen, they couldn’t help but get nervous.

Those who had tried to block Long Chen before got far out of his way when he passed this time, quivering in fear. They were afraid of his revenge.

Most importantly, their strongest experts were communing with their ancestral scales and could not be disturbed. If Long Chen were to cause trouble for them now, they would be powerless to resist.

So, when Long Chen passed through their nests, they were terrified, and when he finally left, they all sighed with relief. After a while, some of them found that their backs were covered in sweat.

Long Chen easily passed through this region and arrived at the white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. This place was still peaceful, as the battle on that side didn’t disturb this place.

Also, given the characters of the white dragon race, they probably wouldn’t go watch even if they did sense something. Everyone was around the white ancestral scale, in the process of a sacred ceremony.

When Long Chen arrived, he finally couldn’t endure any longer. His vision turned black as he passed out.

Darkness, endless darkness. Long Chen slowly floated down in what seemed like a black, bottomless abyss. There was no end to it; he was just falling.

However, for some reason, he didn’t feel any fear within this darkness. Instead, an unusual sense of tranquility washed over him.

It almost felt like he had returned to being a fetus in the womb, being nourished by the world. Here, no one could harm him.

Long Chen slowly descended, and a pair of eyes silently appeared above him.

They were pitch-black, one with the darkness. Merciless and cold, they resembled the eyes of a malevolent being peering down at Long Chen. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, Long Chen remained oblivious. He was as serene as a slumbering infant, unmoving, just like the eyes themselves.

In this abyss, there was no hint of light or sound. Space and time seemed nonexistent, as if everything the world once held had been consumed by darkness.

Suddenly, those eyes staring at Long Chen moved. They gazed into the distance and then slowly vanished.

“Great nine star heir, you can’t keep sleeping.”

The ancient voice once more rang out. Within the darkness, Long Chen’s eyelids twitched as if he was trying to pry open his eye but failed. He tried to open his mouth to speak but was powerless to do so.

“Great nine star heir, I know you’re tired, but you don’t have time to rest. You are getting closer and closer to me. At the same time, your situation is growing more and more precarious. Hurry and activate the eighth star. Pass through the channel to the ninth heaven and save us... We can’t hold on much longer...”

Long Chen suddenly sat up as the darkness vanished, and a gentle white light was enveloping him.

There was a giant white dragon in the air looking at Long Chen. Long Chen knew that this was the white ancestral scale’s inner space.

“Many thanks, senior.” Long Chen hastily rose and thanked the white dragon.

“Great Dragon Sovereign heir, being able to help you is my honor,” responded the dragon humbly.

Long Chen suddenly looked around and saw that Bai Yingxue was also here. He was delighted. “Does this mean she has received your approval?”

Long Chen was happy for Bai Yingxue. She was gentle and kind, and he hoped for her to gain this ancestral scale’s power.

“Originally, with her aptitude, she wouldn’t be qualified to come here. But due to your arrival and the karma involved, I considered it and gave her this chance to enter this space. As for whether or not she can subdue the ancestral scale, it will be up to her,” replied the white dragon.

Suddenly, the white dragon solemnly said, “Great Dragon Sovereign heir, I feel... I feel like it is time for you to leave.”
