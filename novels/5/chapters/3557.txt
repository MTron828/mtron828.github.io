Chapter 3546

Heaven and earth shuddered. At this moment, a pillar of fire soared into the sky, piercing the very dome of the heavens. From it, endless flame runes transformed into a rain of light that covered the entire world.

The rain of light contained berserk flame runes that exploded when they landed on the ground. Also, this rain of light was strong enough to kill Immortal Kings.

“ROAR!”

“Kill!”

Within this rain of light, countless lifeforms and Heavenly Flame Spirits were fighting. They were fighting over those specks of light.

This rain contained the world’s energy. Hence, whether it was the lifeforms that had come from the immortal world or the native Heavenly Flame Spirits, they were driven crazy by it.

People viewed the Heavenly Flame Spirits as great sources of nourishment, but the Heavenly Flame Spirits also viewed the invaders as pieces of meat that had come to them. Now due to fighting over the rain of light, all of them went crazy.

It was a completely chaotic battle. Every single lifeform that you saw was an enemy. It was to the extent that the Heavenly Flame Spirits were attacking fellow Heavenly Flame Spirits and humans attacking other humans. On this battlefield, other than yourself, you couldn’t trust anyone.

Many human experts already had their physical bodies destroyed, and yet they continued to fight crazily as Yuan Spirits. To flame cultivators, the physical body wasn’t particularly important. Whether it was taking over a body or creating a new body, they weren’t difficult. As long as their flame energy was strong enough, they could still be powerful experts.

The flames here contained the world’s core energy, and no one could resist this allure. Hence, people crazily fought over them.

Whether it was the people or the Heavenly Flame Spirits that were killed, they would release flame energy that could be absorbed anew.

It was like a group of people carrying gold and silver were killing each other. Anyone who fell would have their treasures scattered to the ground as well. This sight made people forget their fear of death. All they thought about was gathering those treasures.

The space for millions and millions of miles was filled with various flames. People’s lives were like blades of grass here, and the air was filled with a crazy scent.

Moreover, various lifeforms from different races continued to crazily charge toward the core. As for the Heavenly Flame Spirits, they continued coming from every single direction. The battle only continued to grow increasingly chaotic.

If you got through the outer edge of this battlefield and could see the core, you would see countless heavenly geniuses of the various races fighting against the Heavenly Flame Spirits.

This region contained Heavenly Flame Spirits that had at least reached the levels of fifth and sixth Heavenstage World Kings. However, all of them were so enormous that every time their giant bodies moved, they appeared very clumsy.

Even so, their attack ranges were huge. A single attack could wipe out all the surrounding Heavenly Flame Spirits.

As for the humans, due to possessing smaller bodies, they actually had quite the advantage, slipping their way through the chaos and grabbing whatever benefits they could.

However, there was still endless danger here. One lifeform actually stuck to the back of another Heavenly Flame Spirit for safety, only for another Heavenly Flame Spirit far off in the distance to spit out a flame divine sword that pierced through the bodies of several Heavenly Flame Spirits.

That lifeform originally wasn’t on that path, but the Heavenly Flame Spirit that he was on wanted to attack someone else and directly moved him into the path of that attack.

As a result, that lifeform was slain without even realizing what had happened. Not just his physical body, but even his Yuan Spirit was destroyed by that attack.

The Heavenly Flame Spirits were going crazy and unleashed random attacks fearlessly. They didn’t even let off the ninth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits at the center. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Sometimes, a few hundred attacks would land on a ninth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit all at once, and even it wouldn’t be able to endure it.

The closer you went to the core, the stronger the Heavenly Flame Spirits were. Where the pillar of light was shooting out of, there were three mountain-sized Heavenly Flame Spirits. Their mouths were opened wide as they devoured that flame energy.

These three Heavenly Flame Spirits possessed heaven-shaking auras. They were all existences on the level of Divine Venerates, and they ignored the chaotic battle around them.

Although a few crazed Heavenly Flame Spirits attacked them, even the ninth Heavenstage ones were unable to shake them, so they couldn’t be bothered to even pay attention to the battle. They only focused on absorbing this flame energy.

As for up in the sky, a sphere of rainbow light was repeatedly clashing with a blood-colored light. The void also rumbled with every collision. Because of it, the space around them was covered in cracks that spread hundreds of miles. It was like the world was about to shatter.

“Yu Qingxuan, hand over the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. That is your only path to survival.” A sinister and dark voice came from the blood-colored light, and it was dripping with bloodthirstiness. It was not the voice of a human but more like the growl of a devil. It shook people’s souls.

That giant blood-colored light contained a long-haired man in blood-red armor and a blood-red spear. His scarlet eyes were like the eyes of a fiend tightly locked onto his opponent.

“You fiend, we are natural enemies. Today, only one of us will live to leave this place.” Yu Qingxuan stood on her war chariot within the rainbow flames, holding a seven-colored divine sword. Her eyes were full of hatred and killing intent as she looked at her opponent.

“I am Sovereign Yan Xu’s ninth son, Yan Hong. The Darklight Heaven’s Heavenly Rainbow Flame was already consumed by my eighth brother. The Heavenly Rainbow Flames are destined to be our food. Once I devour your Heavenly Rainbow Flame, I will break through my shackles and condense the Yan Xu True Flame. For this one day, I’ve waited hundreds of thousands of years. Hand over the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. That is your only choice,” said Yan Hong greedily.

“The Heavenly Rainbow Flame has merged with me. It is my conviction, my life. If you have the ability, then you can take it along with my life. If you don’t have that ability, then I will take your life. I have never hated someone as much as I have today.” Yu Qingxuan glared at Yan Hong with icy killing intent in her beautiful eyes.

“How foolish. My Yan Xu line can devour the ten thousand flames. I am an unrivaled existence in this world. I have mercy on you because I want to absorb the complete Heavenly Rainbow Flame. I don’t want you to deplete its core energy. But since you refuse to recognize kindness, I will simply consume it by force. Although there will be some loss, I can make up for it here. You have no idea. Before your Heavenly Rainbow line awakens the Heavenly Rainbow manifestation, you are innately suppressed by my Yan Xu race.” Yan Hong laughed sinisterly. His spear suddenly quivered.

Black threads then appeared amongst the red flames around Qi Hong’s body. They were like black vipers extending out.

Yu Qingxuan was shocked. Those black threads easily broke her defenses. Most terrifying of all, when those flames invaded, the flame energy around her involuntarily flowed out. In just a breath’s time, she had lost thirty percent of the flame energy in her body.

Her power was actually drawn into the void by those black threads, dispersed into heaven and earth. She had never seen such a terrifying power.

Yu Qingxuan rapidly retreated, slashing her sword at those threads. However, those black threads were incomparably tough. When her sword struck them, her core energy rapidly flowed away once more.

But just then, huge explosions rang out in the distance, and a voice rang out like a god’s howl. It shook the nine heavens, causing the world to change color.

“Whoever dares to touch a hair on Yu Qingxuan’s head will regret ever coming to this world!”
