Chapter 4540 Seeing A Nine Star Heir Again

“What the fuck?!”

In the midst of his slashing motion, Long Chen was scared shitless by the talking skeleton. He then swiftly twisted his saber, causing it to narrowly miss the lifeform’s head and instead strike the bow of the ship, leaving a gaping hole there.

Long Chen nearly twisted his waist as he adjusted the trajectory of his saber. With shock etched on his face, he observed a faint red light emanating from the lifeform’s eyes.

That light came from the blood that Feng You had just coughed out. In other words, Feng You’s blood had awakened it.

“Out of the way!” said the lifeform coldly, its voice impolite. Long Chen clenched his saber and was about to say something when the lifeform continued, “I don’t have much time. I have to pass down my inheritance.”

Long Chen only moved aside when he heard that. The lifeform raised its withered hand, and Feng You quivered, waking up from her unconscious state.

After waking up, she was delighted to find that she had formed a bloodline connection with this lifeform.

The lifeform didn’t speak and just pressed a withered finger on her forehead. Feng You then trembled, and her essence blood flowed into that finger.

Long Chen was shocked, thinking that this corpse was absorbing her essence blood. Just as he was about to stop it, a rune on the corpse’s hand slowly merged into her head.

Long Chen realized that it was borrowing the power of Feng You’s essence blood to activate its own runes. That was the only way to transfer his inheritance to Feng You.

The inheritance methods of demonic beasts and divine beasts differed significantly from those of the human race. Their legacies were primarily transmitted through bloodlines, relying on bloodline power as the conduit to pass down their teachings and abilities.

Observing Feng You's joy, Long Chen felt a sense of relief. He then surveyed their surroundings before striding confidently toward the heart of the Ghost Ship.

When examining the Ghost Ship, he had noticed an altar-like thing at the heart of the ship. That was his goal. Since Feng You was in no danger and time was pressing, he immediately went for it.

This Ghost Ship was enormous, and its bow was full of standing Yin Soldiers. Not daring to disturb them, Long Chen carefully crept past them. After the span of an incense stick burning, he saw the giant altar again.

The square-shaped altar was three hundred meters tall and covered in flowery marks that emitted a sinister aura. Long Chen slowly climbed up, discovering that it had nine levels in total. At the highest level rested a coffin.

This coffin was inscribed with various fiendish faces that were incomparably frightening. Long Chen couldn’t help but shiver when he approached, knowing that whatever lay inside was an unimaginable existence.

However, when he reached the ninth level and could see the coffin’s full appearance, he was stunned. It was actually half open.

“Has someone already come here?!”

Long Chen almost didn’t dare to believe his eyes. No wonder he had sensed something off upon reaching the summit.

Looking inside the coffin, he gasped to see two corpses inside. One lay at the bottom, while the other was squatting on top of it. It was such an intimate scene that, at first glance, it seemed almost inappropriate, as if it needed censoring. However, there was no hint of intimacy or mating between them. Instead, both of their palms pierced into each other’s bodies, suggesting that they had killed each other.

Long Chen clenched his saber. After observing for a long time and detecting no danger, he used his saber to touch the squatting corpse.

As the tip of the saber made contact with the arm, it emitted a strange metallic sound, catching Long Chen off guard once again. How could it be so incredibly hard?

Summoning his courage, Long Chen decided to take a closer look and climbed into the coffin. Despite its seemingly small exterior, the interior of the coffin was surprisingly spacious, resembling its own world. Even after entering, Long Chen found himself not at all squeezed for space.

“A nine star heir!”

Long Chen let out a startled cry once he was inside. This corpse had specks of starlight on it, indicating that it had transformed into stars—a feat achievable only by cultivating the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art to a certain realm.

Long Chen had never dreamed that he would encounter a nine star heir here, and one of such terrifying caliber at that. Although he was already dead, based on how his body had turned astral, his realm had probably reached the Sage King realm.

Upon closer examination, Long Chen saw that the corpse lying on the bottom also had traces of those stars as well.

Seeing this, Long Chen was dumbfounded. That corpse had withered to the point where its appearance was indiscernible, but based on how its canine teeth were sticking out of its mouth, it wasn’t human.

“Perhaps this nine star heir came onto the Ghost Ship to eliminate this lifeform inside of the coffin.”

Long Chen came up with a hypothesis from what he saw. However, what baffled him was why someone as immensely powerful as this nine-star heir would choose to sacrifice himself for this cause.

“Sorry for this.”

Long Chen bowed slightly to the nine star heir and carefully lifted his corpse from the grasp of the lifeform. Upon closer inspection, Long Chen noticed that the nine-star heir’s hands were pitch-black, while the opposing lifeform’s claws had transformed entirely into stars.

Unexpectedly, the nine star heir’s corpse was as heavy as a mountain, requiring considerable effort for Long Chen to move it. Despite remaining intact without decay after all this time, the nine star heir’s soul was completely gone. Long Chen tried to form a spiritual connection with it, but there was no reaction.

Long Chen helplessly placed his corpse in the primal chaos space. When he had a chance, he would bury it in a suitable place.

Long Chen then examined the corpse of this lifeform. Its hands and feet were long, and it also had a tail, resembling that of an ape.

“With this dense death aura and given that it was slumbering on this Ghost Ship, this lifeform is very likely connected to the Ghost Sovereign. The nine star heir was willing to sacrifice himself to kill it, so there must be some story behind it,” sighed Long Chen.

Long Chen had the Ghost Sovereign’s mark on him, and back then, the sweeping elder had told him some details about the Ghost Sovereign, but the sweeping elder didn’t seem to find this mark to be anything terrible. Hence, Long Chen hadn’t bothered with it that much.

However, after seeing this dead nine star heir, Long Chen thought of how the Yin Soldiers were the Ghost Sovereign’s troops, and he couldn’t help but feel that the Ghost Sovereign’s mark appearing on him was not a coincidence.

Long Chen picked up that lifeform, only to find eight tentacle-like entities at the bottom of the coffin tightly binding the corpse to the coffin.

However, once Long Chen pulled hard, the eight tentacles snapped at once. Specks of starlight then flickered inside them, causing Long Chen’s heart to leap.

“So this is a divine fetus!”

Seeing the eight tentacles, Long Chen instantly thought of other divine fetuses that he had seen. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Only astral energy was capable of fully killing this divine fetus, and that nine star heir was also capable of destroying the entire Ghost Ship’s formations. No wonder the Yin Soldiers on it are so sluggish!”

Just then, the entire Ghost Ship startled rumbling. Long Chen jumped and immediately flew out of the coffin.
