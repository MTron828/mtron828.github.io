Chapter 4834 Blood Sea Sword Formation

Both of their auras surged as they summoned their manifestations. Behind Hu Yifei, a blood sea emerged, dotted with starlight, and massive crimson waves surged skyward.

Simultaneously, a violet chrysanthemum radiated behind Yu Ziqiong, its roots reaching into the heavens. However, its flower was covered in frost, causing the temperature of the martial stage to plummet.

“A merger between ice and life elements?” Long Chen was surprised, and rightfully so, as it was a very rare manifestation.

When both manifestations appeared, their range was very limited, only a few dozen meters wide at first. However, as time passed, they grew crazily, spreading even under the pressure of the devil qi. Everything occurred in this special martial stage—a special cultivation land that forced the fighters to endure the pressure of the devil bones.

There was a meaning behind the numbers of the martial stages as every single stage had its own specific laws. A rough assessment was made based on both sides' strengths to determine the appropriate stage for their match.

If the martial stage’s pressure was too weak while the competitors were too strong, it would damage the martial stage. However, if the pressure was too strong and the competitors were too weak, they would be unable to move under the pressure, and there would be no point to the fight.

Hence, the first thing to do once the battle started was to endure the trial of the stage. If a person could not even endure this, they would instantly be eliminated, which was the most embarrassing kind of defeat in Devil Fall City. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Hu Yifei and Lu Ziqiong continued to stand in their original locations, the fluctuations of their manifestations growing stronger and stronger. However, both manifestations remained relatively evenly sized, and their aura fluctuations were also extremely similar, causing the expressions of the Lu family disciples to change.

“What is going on? With big sister’s power, she should be directly crushing him!”

“This bastard, Could he have been concealing his true power all along? How sneaky!” Lu Chengfeng gritted his teeth, his confidence in Yu Ziqiong wavering as he observed the evenly matched manifestations.

The pressure of the martial stage was evenly spread, forcing both competitors to endure without any room for tricks or hidden power. No one would dare to conceal their true power under it.

If they were to conceal their power and the other side’s manifestation grew larger than theirs, the pressure on them would increase. Thus, both sides were racing to take the initiative at the start.

The expansion of their manifestations marked the initial phase of the competition, and the winner of this first part would essentially decide the ultimate victor.

Lu Ziyu clenched her fists, her fingers growing pale from how hard she was clenching them. She was no longer able to conceal her nervousness.

“Long Chen, do you think my big sister can win?” asked Lu Ziyu suddenly.

For her to ask such a thing now showed her immaturity. At this moment, she urgently hoped for an answer that could comfort her. Long Chen then looked at her curiously, realizing that despite her powerful aura, she didn’t have that much actual combat experience. Perhaps she had never even experienced a true life-and-death battle.

Long Chen shook his head.

“What?!” Lu Ziyu’s expression completely changed.

Long Chen hastily said, “I meant that it’s too soon to make a judgment yet.”

Long Chen was speechless. Things had only progressed to this point, so how could he tell who would win? It felt like he was sitting beside a group of children.

Long Chen looked at Mo Nian, and the latter shrugged helplessly. He also hadn’t expected these people, who seemed to possess such immense power, to actually be greenhouse flowers. They could only be looked at, not used for anything.

Just then, the martial stage quivered, and the rising pressure settled down. Hu Yifei and Lu Ziqiong’s manifestation had rapidly expanded. At this moment, it seemed like the power restricting them had fully vanished.

“Blood Sea Sword Formation!”

Hu Yifei formed hand seals. When the specks of starlight in his manifestation exploded, swords came shooting out of it.

“To nourish divine weapons inside of a manifestation, this fellow must have a lot of money,” commented Long Chen. The Lu family’s disciples were befuddled, not knowing what he was talking about.

“That’s true. To be able to nourish tens of thousands of soul weapons and raise them within his manifestation, he must have eaten a lot of medicinal pills.” Mo Nian nodded in agreement.

“No, he only has a few hundred Soul Blood Swords...” remarked Lu Chengfeng, but he suddenly shut his mouth, staring in shock.

“Tens of thousands?”

Lu Ziyu stared at the blood sea manifestation and saw only a few hundred swords flying out at this time. In an instant, she understood that Hu Yifei really had been concealing his power.

At this moment, Lu Ziqiong made her move. With a swift downward swing of her sword, a chilling frost enveloped the air. The swords coming from all directions were instantly frozen in place, thwarted by her frost domain.

Lu Ziqiong’s sword pressed forward after freezing the surrounding swords, breaking right through Hu Yifei’s sword formation and shooting toward his head.

Hu Yifei snorted. “Interesting. But you aren’t capable of freezing three hundred of my soul-slicing swords.”

Hu Yifei stepped back and formed more hand seals, turning those frozen soul swords into smoke. The swords then bizarrely appeared right in front of Lu Ziqiong as she attacked, blocking her sword.

Not looking back, Lu Ziqiong swung her sword behind her, sending over a hundred swords that had silently appeared there flying.

Lu Ziqiong’s movements were graceful, showing her combat experience. Moreover, her reaction speed showed her quick judgment and sharp senses. At this moment, Lu Chengfeng and the others cheered for her.

However, Long Chen frowned. “This is bad.”

“Ugh.” Mo Nian sighed.

“What is it? Can you tell me what’s bad?” urged Lu Ziyu worriedly.

Mo Nian helplessly said, “Your sister has fallen for this fellow’s trap. He intentionally said that he had three hundred swords and used one hundred and fifty to block her attack. Your big sister saw that the numbers were wrong, so she immediately reacted and knocked away the one hundred and fifty swords that appeared behind her. Now, she feels like there are only three hundred swords, so she’ll start to pay attention to the number of swords and their changes in order to read his attacks. That’s the trap.”

Lu Ziyu and the others had yet to even comprehend what Mo Nian was saying when Lu Ziqiong pressed the attack, forcing Hu Yifei further and further back.

All of a sudden, a shocking scene revealed itself to the spectators. Tens of thousands of swords condensed behind Lu Ziqiong, and she didn’t even seem to see them as she pressed forward.

“Big Sister, watch out!” Lu Ziyu let out a heart-rending cry. At this time, those tens of thousands of swords finished condensing, and Hu Yifei sneered.

“Die! Ten Thousand Sword Mergers!”

The tens of thousands of swords merged into one enormous blade that thrust toward Lu Ziqiong’s back.
