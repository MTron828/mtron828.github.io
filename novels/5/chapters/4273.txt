Heavenly River Blood Crocodile, Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth, and Six Horn Barbarian Bull were all extremely terrifying existences within the demonic beast race. Their power was not much weaker than the Black Tortoise, Heavenly Tiger, and Kunpeng races.

However, these three races were crafty, acting like everything beforehand was none of their business. They hadn’t drawn anyone’s attention before.

Now that they saw their chance, they immediately pounced on it.

After watching for so long, they knew precisely where the Dragonblood Legion’s defenses were most vulnerable. Their target was the gap between Tang Wan-er and Ye Zhiqiu’s blockades, and they planned to instantly charge through that opening.

Tang Wan-er and Ye Zhiqiu were enraged. These experts came too suddenly, giving them no chance to react.

However, neither of them could move from their current positions. As soon as they did, the experts they were holding back at this moment would charge forward, and their defensive line would be forced to rapidly fall back.

“Leave them to me!”

Just then, giant figures arrived from the core of the Dragonblood Legion. Windy and the others had appeared, and this group of warriors from the Barbarian race directly charged at the Heavenly River Blood Crocodiles, Gold Tusk Wild Mammoths, and Six Horn Barbarian Bulls.

“Damn barbarians! Scram!”

One of the Gold Tusk Wild Mammoths roared, letting out a heaven-shaking cry. After summoning its true body, it looked like a mountain charging forward. Its golden tusks were shining brightly and thundered through the air.

“What terrifying Blood Qi!”

Shocked cries rang out. This Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth’s pressure was not at all inferior to that of Zhao Xingtian, Ye Wuchen, and the others. It possessed a terrifying momentum as it charged forward.

That Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth reached the Barbarian race’s experts in the blink of an eye, smashing into them in the most direct and violent manner.

The rest of Heavenly River Blood Crocodile, Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth, and Six Horn Barbarian Bull races were following as well, intending to pierce through the Dragonblood Legion’s blockade to throw their formation into chaos and ruin their tempo.

However, at this moment, Windy shouted and his body explosively grew. His form enlarged dramatically, resembling a giant, and he wielded a white bone hatchet in his hand. Just like that, he smashed it down at the first Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth.

Windy’s body was covered with bulging muscles and shining golden runes, while his Blood Qi surged forth from within.

BOOM!

Bracing the impact, Windy’s body quivered and he was pushed back. Seeing this, the Barbarian warriors behind him also transformed into giants, pressing on Windy’s body, working together to resist the attack.

What shocked people was that the Barbarian race’s warriors were using the simplest, clumsiest fighting style of a human wall to block this assault.

The Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth pushed hundreds of Barbarian experts back, but only managed to take a few steps before its speed plummeted.

At that moment, a giant crocodile unleashed a ray of light out of its mouth at the Barbarian warriors.

BOOM!

Their combined defense was blown back again, and the ray of light was shattered in the process. Their formation was now in disarray.

“Die!”

Just as their formation was tumbling down, a furious roar rang out. A bull with six horns on its head pounced through the air, charging toward them with explosive Blood Qi.

Three peak level demonic beasts had attacked, their combination flawless. This level of cooperation could not be achieved without practice.

On the other hand, the Barbarian warriors were powerful enough to receive these attacks, but their cooperation was extremely clumsy. Only a dozen Barbarian warriors were in place to intercept the Six Horn Wild Bull.

There was no way that their paltry numbers could block this attack that had been charging up energy for so long, but they still fearlessly raised their hatchets.

BOOM!

The Six Horn Wild Bull’s horns lit up, blasting through them, sending those Barbarian warriors tumbling back. They were unable to stop it.

However, to everyone’s surprise, even after receiving such a terrifying attack, those Barbarian warriors once more stood up, not looking injured at all.

People stared in shock at their terrifying physical bodies. It had to be known that this peak expert of the Six Horn Barbarian Bull race had just used one of its innate divine abilities, and that attack was not inferior to the blow from an Eternal divine weapon. However, it was unable to harm them.

“Kill!”

The Six Horn Barbarian Bull was also shocked that they weren’t even injured, but it didn’t bother wasting time on them. With a shout, it charged through to the Dragonblood warriors.

With the Barbarian warriors’ defenses torn apart, the three armies of the demonic beast races poured through like lava.

The peak expert of the Six Horn Barbarian Bull race roared. In its eyes, the Dragonblood warriors weren’t people but clumps of karmic luck runes. It was the first to reach them.

Just as it prepared to attack them, a pair of large hands caught its horns, and it came to a grunting stop.

Following that, a cracking sound rang out as its horns were directly snapped by those hands.

“AHH!”

The Six Horn Barbarian Bull screamed and shot back. Now, a giant figure could be seen standing in front of the Dragonblood Legion.

“King!”

“Wilde!”

When that figure stood, all the Barbarian warriors and Dragonblood warriors cheered. Wilde was awake.

Wilde’s eyelids were still drooping. He clearly had just awoken and was staring at the two horns in his hands foolishly. He then looked around in a daze.

“Brother Long!”

Wilde instantly spotted Long Chen. His voice quivered, and his eyes instantly reddened.

“Brother Long, Wilde missed you!”

“Good brother, I also missed you. But now isn’t the time to talk. Help everyone deal with the enemies!” shouted Long Chen emotionally. He was overjoyed to see that Wilde had awakened.

“Alright!”

Wilde excitedly looked around and began to cry out one name after another in delight. “Big Sister Meng Qi, Big Sister Chu Yao-!”

“Watch out!” Tang Wan-er suddenly cried out. That Six Horn Barbarian Bull took advantage of Wilde’s distraction, and its four horns lit up. Four rays of divine light then shot toward Wilde.

Despite Tang Wan-er's warning, no one knew whether Wilde was still groggy from sleep or if his reflexes were genuinely that sluggish. Those four rays of divine light simply struck his chest.

As a result, Wilde’s body quivered, and he took a step back. Four black spots appeared on his chest.

“What?!”

That Six Horn Barbarian Bull was completely shocked. This was its innate divine ability, and it had supreme killing power. However, it only burned a bit of Wilde’s skin? There wasn’t even any blood.

“That hurts! I’ll eat you!”

Wilde held his chest and roared. The next moment, a giant bone club appeared in his hand, and he smashed it at that Six Horn Barbarian Bull.

.

BANG!

That Six Horn Barbarian Bull’s head was instantly smushed.
