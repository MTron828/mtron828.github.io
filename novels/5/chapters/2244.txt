Chapter 2234 All Living Things Are Chess Pieces

“I will represent the divine families in apologizing to you over this matter.”

Shen Chengfeng and Long Chen left the entrance to the Yin Yang World and found a secluded place. Shen Chengfeng sighed.

“Whether or not you apologize doesn’t mean anything to me. What I want to know is why they would target me? Who is Ye Yaochen?” asked Long Chen.

Shen Chengfeng hesitated. He shook his head. “This matter is too complicated. It is not convenient for me to say anything about it. But don’t worry, Elder Long has a very high opinion of you. That’s why he called me out of the Ancient Battlefield. But I can tell you this much: take advantage of this chance. The Star Field Divine World is extremely important to Netherpassage experts. Before coming, I investigated you. There was one thing you said that I like: cultivation is to live with dignity. But in this world, just living is already very difficult. As for living with dignity, that’s even harder. Hence, work hard to obtain your spots in the Star Field Divine World this time. It will not only allow you to live longer, but it will also give your voice greater priority.”

Shen Chengfeng didn’t directly talk about what had caused this. It seemed that it was taboo to him.

“Then I want to know, if such a thing happens again, what will you do?” asked Long Chen.

“Don’t worry, I will warn them. Such a matter will definitely not occur within the short term,” guaranteed Shen Chengfeng.

It wouldn’t happen in the short term, meaning it would happen in the future? Long Chen seemed to have grasped something. The waters in the interior of the divine families were very deep.

“I don’t like being a chess piece for others.” Long Chen shook his head.

Shen Chengfeng smiled. “Heaven and earth are the board, and all living things are the game pieces. All people have their own destinies set for themselves. Isn’t working hard at cultivation means to get stronger to jump out of the chess board and find a different destiny? Without power, you will not be qualified to jump out of the chess board. No one can escape being a chess piece, except at the final moment where we see if a chess piece can escape its fate and become the player moving the pieces.”

Long Chen was startled and looked at Shen Chengfeng more closely. He hadn’t expected him to have such a sharp view of the world.

“Thank you for your advice.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

Shen Chengfeng shook his head. “You’re too courteous. I was born at the wrong time, and it has worn down my sharpness. A chess piece remains a chess piece. But you, you have maintained your sharpness. It seems that your character will not change, so there are only two possibilities. Either you manage to escape the board, or you will be destroyed. I hope it’s the former, so don’t let any chances to get stronger slip by you. Opportunities lie within danger. The greater the danger, the greater the opportunity. It will depend on whether or not you can pass it or not.”

Long Chen nodded. He felt that Shen Chengfeng was not bad. The person that Elder Long had sent was similar to him.

“How about you let this matter pass like this? Once you are stronger, you can handle it yourself,” proposed Shen Chengfeng.

“Since you put it this way, what can I say?” Long Chen shrugged. If he kept making a fuss about this matter, demanding an explanation from the divine families would be rude. Shen Chengfeng was clearly protecting him on this matter.

Long Chen felt that the divine families definitely had people from outside the world. He didn’t know their secrets. Perhaps this matter was related to their own internal conflict.

Just as Shen Chengfeng said, quibbling over this was meaningless. In fact, forcing it might be unfavorable to him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Since Shen Chengfeng had said to let it go and wait until he was stronger to avenge it, Long Chen could only accept it.

Shen Chengfeng smiled and turned to leave. However, after a few steps, he suddenly paused and looked back.

“The interior of the divine families is complicated. But Elder Long has always been impartial and is a true man. If you have difficulties, he will help you. Look after yourself.”

Long Chen nodded and cupped his fists. For Shen Chengfeng to actually say such a thing, he could be viewed as a friend.

Shen Chengfeng left with his men, but not before scolding the people from the outer branches, saying not to activate the forbidden emergency signal for such unimportant matters.

When one of them mentioned that Long Chen had gone against the Heavenly Divine Writ, Shen Chengfeng sneered, “The Heavenly Divine Writ clearly stated that no one was allowed to attack Long Chen. Those attacks included words.”

After saying that, Shen Chengfeng left, leaving the members of the outer branches gloomy.

“Hey, aren’t you very arrogant? Keep being arrogant!” Guo Ran laughed at them. The people of the outer branches were nothing more than dogs of the true divine families. All they knew to do was use the prestige of their masters to intimidate others.

“You...!” The members of the outer branches trembled in fury.

“What you? Did you not hear the words of your master? No one is allowed to attack the Dragonblood Legion. Even words can constitute an attack. Are you cursing me?” taunted Guo Ran.

The other experts that had come were all stunned. The divine families were actually so protective of Long Chen that they didn’t even care about him killing members of the outer branches.

They also saw that Zhao Feng had been used by someone else. It seemed that the one who had used him had quite a status, to the point that Shen Chengfeng was unable to do anything to them over this matter.

This matter was settled like this. However, after this, no one dared to be the slightest bit disrespectful to Long Chen. Long Chen was unafraid of the divine families, and no rules could restrict him. If they provoked him, that would purely be courting death.

“Hmph!” The members of the outer branches turned to leave.

“Hold it.” Long Chen suddenly opened his mouth.

“What... what do you want? We haven’t provoked you!” Their expressions instantly changed.

“The divine families told me they would send someone to cooperate with us.” Long Chen sneered at their frightened appearance. They only knew how to bully the weak.

Hearing that, those elders sighed with relief. One of them said, “We’ll send someone later.”

“I want them now. If you stall my important affairs, are you able to accept the consequences?” shouted Long Chen. He was worried about these old bastards stalling.

“We’ll arrange things within two hours!” said the elder with no other choice. He really had been planning on dragging this out until Long Chen had to acknowledge them.

The person that the divine families were sending was an expert on the Blood race’s history and combat power. They had to be skilled in differentiating the different members of the Blood race and their divine abilities.

That was very important to Long Chen. They weren’t worried about Long Chen not coming to them for such an important asset. But Long Chen had easily seen through that little ploy.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, if you need anything from us, just ask!” One of the Righteous path’s experts ran forward.

“Yes, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, although we can’t participate in the battle, whatever you need as support is no problem. We can do it.”

“That’s right, we can help out. Please senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, don’t be courteous.”

“With such a huge battle coming, the Dragonblood warriors should rest. Leave the work to us.”

More and more of the Righteous path’s experts ran over. Although they wore robes of their various sects, they all had the word Alliance embroidered on the front of their robes. They were all on the same side.

Facing these people’s ardent emotions, Long Chen smiled. “Many thanks, brothers. It just so happens we need to arrange some things, and we might need your help. But let me say this first, there are no wages! But there’s good wine and food.”

“Hahaha, alright. To drink with the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one legion will be enough for me to brag for a lifetime!”

“Alright, then brothers, we’re going to rest. Once we discuss and confirm things, we can work together,” said Long Chen.

The Righteous disciples returned to their tents excitedly, waiting for Long Chen’s summons. Those tents were transportation formations capable of connecting to their sects. If anything happened, the experts from those sects could immediately come here as reinforcements.

Long Chen didn’t bother setting up a transportation formation. There was no need to. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s experts didn’t need much time at all to fly over.

Long Chen walked over to the entrance of the Yin Yang World. The space here was quivering, and the Sovereign seal was already starting to dim. The inside was a mass of primal chaos. It was impossible to see through it.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran got to work, surveying the terrain. They needed to make the most arrangements. During this battle, there could be no failure, as it would relate to the lives of the Dragonblood warriors.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, I was assigned to you by the Fifth Elder.” Suddenly, a shy voice rang out. Long Chen looked back to see a short, slightly dark-faced woman standing nervously there.

Long Chen instantly understood that the old idiots from the divine families had sent him a completely ordinary person to anger him. Those old fellows really were idiots.

“Don’t be afraid. Can I ask if those old fellows don’t like me?” asked Long Chen.
