Five stars lit up. Even the darkness could not absorb their light. With the Five Star Battle Armor active, the darkness could no longer strip away Long Chen’s power.

His astral spaces unleashed a torrent of power that filled him with strength. This was why despite being in Ye Ming’s domain with his power sucked away, he didn’t feel the slightest fear or panic.

His power no longer stemmed from the outside world. He was not an Empyrean supported by the Heavenly Daos. However, he could get his own energy from his astral spaces.

Furthermore, a surprising phenomenon had occurred after his battle with Feng Fei. At that time, his astral spaces had been fully exhausted. But after that, once they had recovered, it felt as if one of their limiters had been broken. Then upon reaching the fourth step, they had grown even stronger and were continuing to grow. Although he couldn’t see them growing, he could feel it.

The five stars grew brighter and brighter, driving the darkness away. Ye Ming’s figure was quickly revealed.

He was standing in the air, looking coldly at Long Chen. “What a cultivation technique. It actually isn’t suppressed by my manifestation.”

Ye Ming’s tone was flat. It seemed that he wasn’t surprised.

“I’m not the only one who isn’t suppressed by your manifestation. You weren’t able to suppress Mo Nian either, were you?” said Long Chen.

Mo Nian and Ye Ming had fought and ended in a draw. Under the mediation of the divine families, they had come to a stop. Mo Nian had to have been able to block his dark energy as well, or if this domain was summoned, he would definitely die.

“Him? All he did was steal a mortal husk. His divine energy doesn’t match him at all. If I wanted to kill him, he wouldn’t be able to escape my domain. I spared his life because just like you, he is one of my chess pieces. Unfortunately, now I have to get rid of one,” said Ye Ming.

“It just so happens that I was thinking of getting rid of you as well.” Long Chen smiled. Ye Ming seemed extremely confident, but Long Chen was also very confident.

Ye Ming suddenly attacked. His sword was like a viper. Giant cracks appeared in the void as his sword pierced through space.

Meanwhile, black runes lit up on Evilmoon. A dragon roar rang out majestically.

Two divine items clashed, creating an explosion of blinding light and pitch-black darkness. Chaos raged throughout the world along with fragments of spacetime.

Long Chen felt like he was being crushed by an entire world. With a roar, scales suddenly covered his body. His power exploded, and a pillar of light erupted out of him.

With the Azure Dragon Battle Armor and the merging with Evilmoon’s dragon power, a burst of power tore through Ye Ming’s domain. The darkness exploded.

“No wonder you have such an understanding of dark energy. So your saber was made from the bones of a dark evil dragon. It definitely has a suppressive effect on my domain.” Ye Ming retreated, his sharp gaze landing on Evilmoon.

Long Chen clenched Evilmoon. The air around him raged with his power. “Even without Evilmoon, your domain would be unable to bind me.”

Long Chen attacked again. He didn’t use any magical arts but simply pure power.

“Excellent. After being in seclusion for tens of thousands of years, I’ve felt rusty. I can stretch my muscles a bit.” Ye Ming snorted and swung his jagged sword.

The two divine items clashed for a second time. Space twisted, forming two semi-circular worlds around the two of them.

One was the power of Long Chen’s divine ring, while the other was Ye Ming’s dark domain. The two of them were crashing against each other.

Their weapons remained locked together. Every time they shuddered, it caused an explosion in the void.

“Now you have no power to borrow, right? Let’s have a battle with our true abilities.”

With a final explosion, Long Chen shoved and Ye Ming was knocked back.

Long Chen took a deep breath. His aura began to condense.

“I was also thinking of using your blood as a sacrifice to my divine item to awaken it.” Ye Ming’s pure white eyes suddenly began to have lines of blood appear within them, making him appear even more frightening.

Ye Ming pointed his sword at Long Chen. The two eyes within his manifestation grew. His sword shuddered, and an evil aura exploded out of it as if it had come to life.

A ray of sword-light shot out. This sword wasn’t aimed at Long Chen but at the ground. The earth was instantly torn apart and cut through as easily as tofu.

“Using your blood as a sacrifice to my sword can count as an honor for you.” Ye Ming smiled sinisterly, like a leopard looking at its prey.

Ye Ming was just about to strike when his expression suddenly changed. “Count yourself lucky. I’ll let you live a little while longer.”

“But I don’t want to let you live any longer.”

Long Chen didn’t know what Ye Ming was up to, but it seemed that he wanted to run. Long Chen immediately unleashed the attack that he was preparing.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

Ye Ming’s expression changed slightly. A powerful explosion occurred as Long Chen’s attack landed. Ye Ming’s manifestation exploded, while Ye Ming himself vanished.

“Long Chen, I’ll remember this. Next time, I’ll cut off your head!” Darkness filled the world following the explosion of Ye Ming’s manifestation. After the darkness faded, Ye Ming was also gone. The land was a complete mess, and Ye Ming’s aura still hung in the air, but he himself was no longer present.

“What is going on?” asked Long Chen. How was Ye Ming able to so easily slip out of his attack? He had locked onto him with his attack.

“This is another aspect of dark energy. Ye Ming was unable to devour your attack, but he was able to draw it into his manifestation and cause it to explode in there. However, he also paid a price for it. He underestimated your power, causing him to be injured. We should hurry up as well. The core area of the dragon nest has been opened, that’s why he was in such a rush to leave,” urged Evilmoon.

Long Chen quickly rushed off in the direction that Evilmoon indicated. As he flew through the air, Evilmoon explained that Ye Ming was correct. Dark energy was truly one of the world’s strongest powers

However, Ye Ming’s dark energy was not true dark energy. It had too many flaws, so in this lifetime, he wanted to cultivate a new pair of eyes.

According to Evilmoon, these were a pair of evil eyes, but they had yet to be opened. Evilmoon sensed that those eyes had been nourished by the foundation of the Corrupt path’s power for tens of thousands of years.

Once those eyes opened, they might instantly merge with his original eyes, allowing him to control true dark energy.

Evilmoon said that the source of the darkness was a primordial wickedness, which was why the dark evil dragon was the ruler of the evil dragon race. Ye Ming had recognized the primordial wickedness, and he had set everything into motion.

Once he became a god, he didn’t ascend, instead choosing to die and undergo nirvanic rebirth, all to perfectly control dark energy.

Once Ye Ming was in perfect control of the dark energy, then the Corrupt path would definitely become the absolute ruler of the Martial Heaven Continent. That included Long Chen.

“Is dark energy really so powerful?” asked Long Chen.

“Not everyone has a powerful enough cultivation technique to control dark energy like you. Other than that, don’t forget, Ye Ming has become a god. But he chose to not ascend to perfect his dark energy. Before undergoing a nirvanic rebirth, he definitely made countless preparations. He wouldn’t just leave a pair of divine eyes. The entire Corrupt path is his. The accumulations of years of resources are at his disposal. As for you, do you think a young man in his twenties can compare to the resources gathered by billions of experts over tens of thousands of years?” reminded Evilmoon.

Long Chen nodded. Evilmoon was right. Ye Ming had definitely made countless preparations. Perhaps this was the best time to kill him.

“He is also rushing toward the center of the dragon nest. We’ll take a shortcut and see if we can get there ahead of everyone else. It’ll all be up to your… power.” Evilmoon was about to say luck but then decided against it.

BOOM!

After passing through seven worlds, Long Chen appeared in a giant space with countless white bones.

In the distance, he heard zither music containing killing intent. Zi Yan was fighting against someone.
