Chapter 2272 Luo Chuan

“The Martial Heaven Continent?”

Within a hidden cave, that person stared in shock at Long Chen and Dong Mingyu.

“Yes, we come from the Martial Heaven Continent. Based on your appearance, you must come from another continent, correct?” asked Long Chen.

Only then did that person understand. He nodded, saying that he came from a place called the Blue Star Continent.

After asking some questions, Long Chen learned that the Blue Star Continent was similar to the Martial Heaven Continent in that it had been attacked by the Blood race. However, the Blue Star Continent’s war was much more intense. The Blood race had occupied over half the land.

The current Blue Star Continent’s human race was relying on a natural stronghold to stop the Blood race’s invasion. The terrain there made it easy to defend, or the human race would have already been overrun. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

That person introduced himself as Luo Chuan. He was the top genius of one of the sects of the Blue Star Continent. Due to a sudden attack from the Blood race, his sect had fallen into enemy hands. He had been unwilling to flee on his own and had bitterly defended the sect, allowing the other disciples to flee. As a result, he had been poisoned and captured.

According to Luo Chuan, the Blue Star Continent had just gone through its own qi flow eruption. His generation was the continent’s strongest generation. Originally, they had possessed the confidence to handle the Blood race, but the Blood race’s sudden attack caught them off guard. When he explained, he was full of hatred.

Due to the spatial limitations of the connection between the Blue Star Continent and the Yin Yang World, fourth step Netherpassage experts were unable to enter the Blue Star Continent. That made it easier to face the Blood race even though they had invaded the continent.

“Does the Blue Star Continent have any potential Sovereign experts rising?” asked Long Chen.

“Sovereigns? What are they?” asked Luo Chuan.

Only then did Long Chen learn that not all continents had experts on the level of Sovereigns. The Blue Star Continent might be a human continent, but it was still different from the Martial Heaven Continent.

In the Blue Star Continent, there was only the human race, unlike the Martial Heaven Continent with its Xuan Beasts, the ancient races, and the other powers. The Blue Star Continent’s experts were also powerful. Due to never going through miserable wars like the Martial Heaven Continent, many of the sects’ ancient inheritances remained.

“Brother Long, although it’s hard for me to ask this of you, I must. Can you save the other experts of the Blue Star Continent? Over a hundred of us were captured, but based on your explanation, the majority of them have probably been killed. Our last batch had thirty-seven people. We were viewed as prey and released into the Yin Yang World-”

Luo Chuan suddenly shut his mouth as rumbling rang out. A group of the Blood race’s experts whistled by. They were clearly searching for the Blue Star Continent’s experts that they had released.

After they passed, Luo Chuan continued, “You’ve also seen that there’s no chance of us escaping against the Blood race’s giant army. I hope you can help us.”

Long Chen shook his head and sighed. “You’re overestimating me. I was almost noticed when I entered the Yin Yang World. If someone noticed my tracks, it would be difficult for me to flee with my own life.”

Long Chen was aware of his own abilities. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to save them. After all, they were all part of the human race. Furthermore, they were enemies of the Blood race. Saving them would be helping his side as well. But Long Chen was truly powerless against the endless army of the Blood race.

Luo Chuan was disappointed, but he also knew that this request was excessive. If fourth step Netherpassage experts were drawn over, Long Chen would be killed.

“Sorry for asking that of you, brother Long. You saved my life, but I probably won’t have a chance to save you. When I return to the Blue Star Continent, I must rejoin the battle against the Blood race. I suppose that can help as drawing some focus away from the Martial Heaven Continent,” said Luo Chuan.

“You... you can return to the Blue Star Continent?” asked Long Chen, surprised.

“Yes. Our astral spaces are connected to the Blue Star Continent. As long as we sacrifice a portion of our astral spaces, anyone from the Blue Star Continent can condense a transportation formation to return.”

“If that’s true, then I feel like we can try it out,” said Long Chen.

“Try it out?” Luo Chuan was delighted.

“If you can go back on your own like that, we might be able to save the others,” said Long Chen. “I thought that you would need to find the passageway back to your world just like the Martial Heaven Continent. If that was the case, there would be no way to bring you all throughout the Yin Yang World. But if you can return on your own, it’ll be much simpler. If we launch a sneak attack, we can get you all away before the Blood race can react.”

“Brother Long, I should be open with you. Creating such a transportation formation will require a full day and night. I also cannot be interrupted or it would be a waste of all the previous work. Such a thing will definitely be extremely dangerous, so I must warn you. If I caused your death, I wouldn’t be able to rest in peace even in death,” said Luo Chuan gravely.

Long Chen smiled. Luo Chuan really was not bad. He didn’t want to con Long Chen in the slightest. “I know. But I feel like this risk is worth it. After all, we’re all human. We should be united against our enemies.”

Luo Chuan was extremely grateful. He took a deep breath, and clenching his teeth, he took out a bone tablet. It was the size of a fist and glossy like jade. Powerful spiritual fluctuations came from it.

“Brother Long, all my treasures have been dragged out of me by the Blood race. I was only able to keep this, my sect master’s Star Guarding Jade. It was buried deep within my astral space. This Star Guarding Jade is not only a treasure for supporting the astral space’s growth, but it also has my Nine Tribulation Sword Sect’s secret art imprinted on it. The Nine Tribulations Sword Art is a technique ranking amongst the top techniques of the Blue Star Continent. I bestow it to you, brother Long.”

Long Chen hastily waved his hand. “This is a secret of your sect. If an outsider like me were to learn of it, your sect would blame you.”

Luo Chuan bitterly smiled. “My sect? It probably no longer exists. By giving you the Nine Tribulations Sword Art, it can count as entrusting you to pass it on one day. If I die, I would rather not let such a powerful sword art be lost. It doesn’t matter who you transmit it to. I trust that they will use it to attack the Blood race, and I’m sure my sect’s ancestors would support this decision.”

“Then I’ll accept it.” Long Chen nodded and took the bone plate, feeling even more esteem for Luo Chuan. “Brother Luo, are you a sword master? I have a sword here.”

Long Chen suddenly took out a divine item. It was definitely not a bad sword. It might even be classified as better than the swords in the Dragonblood warriors’ hands. That was because their swords were made by Guo Ran so that their power could link. That was where their potential lay.

“This is a good sword. Many thanks.” Luo Chuan seemed to transform into a completely different person. His dispirited air was wiped away.

The three of them walked out of the cave. Luo Chuan led the way. The Blue Star Continent’s experts required the energy of the core of the continent when condensing their Life Star. That allowed them to easily sense in which direction their comrades were when they summoned their manifestations.

Very quickly, Luo Chuan sensed someone. Long Chen changed his appearance on the way, but thinking about it, he supposed that there was no point. Why would the Blood race’s experts recognize him?

That was like recognizing one black leopard amongst millions of them. That was impossible.

Long Chen had come into contact with the Blue Ring Blood race, the Stone Blood race, and the Golden Horned Blood race. Other than that differentiation, he couldn’t recognize one member of the Blood race from another. He supposed that it was the same for the Blood race when it came to the human race.

As long as he switched out Evilmoon for an ordinary saber, that would already be a perfect disguise.

The three of them quickly found a group of the Blood race’s experts attacking a human expert.

“Die!”

Luo Chuan’s eyes turned scarlet, and a streak of light shot out of his sword.

His Sword Qi slashed through their midst. What surprised Long Chen was that Luo Chuan’s sword attack split apart even the laws of heaven and earth. With a sword in hand, Luo Chuan was exceptionally powerful. Although his attack wasn’t as sharp as Yue Zifeng’s, there was surging lightning on top of his sword.

From that lightning, Long Chen sensed a familiar aura. It was the aura of heavenly tribulation.

“Is the Nine Tribulations Sword Art connected to heavenly tribulation?” wondered Long Chen.

The Blood race’s experts were cut down by Luo Chuan’s sword. The lightning on top of it targeted the soul, so even if his sword was blocked, the defender’s soul might still be injured.

“Luo Chuan, don’t bother with me! Run!”

The human being besieged shouted, and as a result of that distraction, he took a fist in the chest and coughed up blood.

The attacker had barely pulled back his fist when a dagger appeared right next to his neck. Startled, blood chains appeared on his neck. The chains were cut by the dagger, and blood spurted out of his neck, but his head was not severed.

The Blood race expert roared, and more blood chains appeared, protecting him. He transformed into a giant ball of chains and rolled away. Knowing he had encountered some powerful enemy, he chose to retreat before anything else.

BOOM!

That ball of chains had barely rolled anywhere when it was kicked back.

Long Chen’s saber chopped down like a bolt of lightning, slicing that ball of chains and the Blood race expert inside in two.
