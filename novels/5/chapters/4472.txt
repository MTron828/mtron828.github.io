Chapter 4461 Either Scram or Die

The palace master hovered in the air, exuding powerful Blood Qi and divine pressure that seemed to fill the world. Behind him, the silhouette of a colossal black dragon soared above the heavens, its gaze piercing down upon the world.

With a single palm, the palace master forced the nether dragon race leader to retreat. Each step backward resulted in the collapse of the space below the nether dragon race leader, and he only managed to regain stability after seven steps.

“You are…!” The nether dragon race leader was shocked and enraged. The expert in front of him was clearly only in the Eternal realm, but his Blood Qi was so powerful that it shook the very stars.

“Scram!” The palace master didn’t pursue the nether dragon race leader after forcing him back. He just clasped his hands behind his back and indifferently said, “Traitor of the dragon race, I should tear all of you to pieces and grind your bones to dust. However, you’ve lost your Ten Thousand Dragon Nest and exhausted a great deal of your energy. With you being so weak, killing you now would damage the prestige of the barbarian dragon race. My barbarian dragon race disdains taking advantage of other people’s precarious situations, so you can just fuck off.”

The palace master gained control over the entire battlefield as soon as he appeared. Numerous experts had heard of his reputation, but before this, they had regarded him as nothing important. After all, in an era dominated by heavenly geniuses, Eternal experts seemed commonplace, and their prominence had seemingly waned.

However, the palace master was capable of fighting head-on against a terrifying Saint, proving that he was no ordinary Eternal expert. Moreover, his disdain for fighting the nether dragon race leader, combined with his overwhelming power, made people realize that, despite the High Firmament Academy’s decline, their foundation remained strong.

The nether dragon race might be powerful, but compared to the High Firmament Academy, it was still greatly lacking. Just a single Long Chen and Dragonblood Legion had almost wiped them out. Now, with the palace master intervening and compelling the nether dragon race leader to retreat, it became evident that the true power of the High Firmament Academy was still concealed, as if the ongoing events were merely the tip of the iceberg.

“Hand over the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, otherwise…!” the nether dragon race leader roared, unwilling to let the matter rest.

His son could be dead for all he knew, and the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest had been taken. If he left like this, the nether dragon race would be truly destroyed. There would be no stopping their decline.

“Either scram or die. Those are your options. If you can give me a reason to kill you, I’d be very happy to help,” stated the palace master coldly, shutting down any kind of negotiations.

The nether dragon race leader quivered with rage, casting resentful glares at Ye Ling in the distance, at Long Chen and the others, and finally at the unyielding palace master. Regret filled him as he faced the harsh consequences of his actions.

The reason he had let Netherdragon Tianzhao challenge Long Chen was for fame. If his son won, the name of the first awakened Doyen would be set in stone, and they would push that advantage.

As long as Netherdragon Tianzhao defeated Long Chen, the name of the nether dragon race would be elevated. Additionally, by being the first to challenge the High Firmament Academy, they would bask in glory after showcasing their true power.

Then, countless factions would want to join the nether dragon race. If they had the allegiance of all the budding Doyens, creating an enormous army, who would dare to fight the nether dragon race?

However, they just had to count their chickens before they hatched. Instead of getting a big piece of fatty meat, they found themselves biting down on unbreakable stone—there was no fat to be had, and they instead broke their own teeth.

Previously, to escape Ye Ling’s seal, the nether dragon race leader had depleted the majority of his core energy, leaving his actual combat power at less than seventy percent of his peak.

Then, the palace master’s attack shocked him. Although it was just a brief exchange, his expert’s intuition told him that the palace master was incredibly powerful. Even at his peak state, he wasn’t assured of being able to beat the palace master. So, in his weakened state, he knew he had no chance at all.

If he were to force it, rather than gaining the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, he could just lose his own life.

If he died, then the nether dragon race might as well just kill itself. If that were to happen, their enemies would have no further misgivings, and the nether dragon race would be ripped out by the roots.

“Good, good, good!” The nether dragon race leader gritted his teeth, uttering three “goods” before continuing, “This time, my nether dragon race admits defeat. We’re leaving.”

The onlookers were stunned by the unexpected turn of events. The nether dragon race was actually admitting defeat?

Long Chen and the palace master were also taken aback. Considering that Netherdragon Tianzhao could be dead and his Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was now in Long Chen’s possession, the nether dragon race leader should have gone for broke and fought to the death.

However, he actually admitted defeat? That was beyond Long Chen’s expectations and served as a warning. The nether dragon race leader was a ruthless character who might resort to unimaginable actions now that he had nothing else to lose.

To be able to maintain his composure even in this state, it meant that he was quite the character.

“Race leader, we can’t!” wailed an Eternal expert. The nether dragon race couldn’t lose their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

“Shut up!” the race leader roared. When he swung his hand, those experts instantly fell silent.

After that, the race leader looked back at Long Chen and the palace master. “This enmity will be remembered by the nether dragon race.”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen looked at him and nodded. “You are correct. The debt between us still exists. This time, I took your Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, and next time, I’ll take your corpse. I will show all traitors that those who sell out their own race won’t have good endings.”

The nether dragon race had betrayed the dragon race to join the Netherworld, resulting in the extermination of many members of the dragon race.

This was also why the nether dragon race was so detested. In the clash between Long Chen and the nether dragon race, only one could prevail and exist in this world.

“Then we’ll wait and see!”

The nether dragon race leader snorted and walked off just like that, while the other experts of the nether dragon race were silently weeping as they followed him.

When they first arrived, the nether dragon race made a grand entrance, showcasing their power with the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest and millions of elite members. Now, with less than ten percent of their forces remaining, their once formidable presence had dwindled to a dejected state, shocking everyone.

In a single battle, the nether dragon race had plummeted from being the strongest to experiencing an instantaneous decline. This dramatic fall was beyond anyone’s imagination.

In less than a day, a mighty race at the peak of their existence had experienced an instantaneous fall. The shock it instilled in everyone lingered for a long time.

When people looked at Long Chen, there was a new reverence in their eyes. Just as the nether dragon race withdrew, the various factions started to move toward the battlefield.

“Anyone who dares to touch a single corpse on the battlefield will be killed on the spot!” announced Long Chen coldly.
