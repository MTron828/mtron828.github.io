Chapter 4062 Expert of the Primal Chaos Era

When the sinister wind blew, the world grew dark and dim, covered by black clouds. In an instant, thick ghost qi filled the air.

With it, everyone’s hair stood on end, and a freezing sensation ran through their bones. It was like they had fallen into an icehouse, and an icy hand was wrapping around their souls. They didn’t even dare to move.

They simply watched as a giant wooden ship broke through the waves. It was enormous, almost like a floating island. Compared to it, Guo Ran’s battleship was like an ant in front of a dragon.

The pitch-black wooden ship had spots of rust on it, while the mast and sail were riddled with holes, looking like they were on the verge of collapse.

“Damn, what a huge ship. But it’s actually a dugout!” Guo Ran instantly saw that despite its size, its shape was that of a simple dugout.

“Good, a lucky ship! Xia Chen, send us over! Be careful not to touch the chains or body, or our battleship will instantly collapse,” said Long Chen excitedly.

“Boss, are you serious?” Xia Chen was green with fright.

“Come on, it’s not like it’s the first time!” Long Chen smiled.

Last time, he had been conned by the Soaring Dragon Company and stumbled upon a Ghost Ship in an unexpected turn of events. After that, Long Chen managed to send the Ghost Ship charging straight into the Soaring Dragon Company’s pier.

Hearing his boss’s order, Xia Chen could only summon his courage. He then turned the battleship, sending it toward the Ghost Ship at maximum speed.

Despite that, the Ghost Ship was actually much faster than them, reaching them in just a few seconds.

Fortunately, despite sailing across the air rapidly, it was more like flying on top of the surface of the water. Since there were no raging waves, they didn’t need to fear that the ship would capsize.

Standing at the head of the Ghost Ship, Long Chen checked his timing and tossed a chain accurately onto the ship’s railing.

During his previous encounter on the Ghost Ship, Long Chen had successfully obtained quite a few chains. While a portion of them had been expended, he still had an ample supply. These chains were Long Chen’s sole defense against the power of corrosion, as other chains would instantly decay before even getting close to the Ghost Ship.

Borrowing the Ghost Ship’s momentum, with a simple pull, Long Chen ended up on the railings. After he landed, he immediately tossed the chain behind him to Uncle Tree.

Uncle Tree simply caught it with his left hand and raised his right hand toward everyone else. Branches then grew out of his arm and wrapped around everyone else.

Long Chen pulled, and everyone flew into the air, accurately landing on the Ghost Ship.

“Don’t touch the mast or the sail. Also, don’t touch anything made of iron,” warned Long Chen.

Long Chen found that this Ghost Ship was different from all the other Ghost Ships that he had encountered. The iron parts were covered in specks of rust and gave off a very frightening feeling. This was definitely a particularly special Ghost Ship.

Everyone felt chills seeing it. Even if Long Chen didn’t say anything, they wouldn’t dare to touch anything here. After all, the aura was too sinister, too frightening.

“Master, this place is ominous. There are strange fluctuations. There are many impure things down below.” Uncle Tree’s gaze cautiously swept through the ship, his expression grave.

Compared to the other Ghost Ships, this one wasn’t covered in corpse soldiers, so the top of the ship was completely empty.

Long Chen also had a bad feeling. At this moment, they heard a strange noise beneath their feet.

It was an extremely odd noise, like footsteps yet also like a broom sweeping. When it appeared, it felt like millions of needles stabbing their souls, causing their souls to quiver and their skins to become covered in goosebumps.

As this sound pierced their souls, to say that they weren’t afraid would be a lie. The most terrifying thing was that they still had no idea what it was.

“Don’t worry, I have the Ghost Sovereign’s mark on me, so the Ghost Ship’s lifeforms won’t attack me. Let’s take a look,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen started walking to the center of the ship because he saw a passageway there.

Everyone simply followed behind him. The Ghost Ship was so large that it took them a full two hours to reach the entrance.

On the way, they kept hearing strange noises. Fortunately, they were true experts; otherwise, just those unknown noises would cause their souls to crumble.

It was also fortunate that they had Long Chen by their side. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have dared to keep going. Once they arrived at the entrance, they saw that it led to the lower level.

As soon as they walked in, the world grew darker, and those strange noises also grew clearer.

They didn’t know how long they walked down the passageway before they reached the lower level. There was not much light here, but some did come through the small chinks in the deck, so it wasn’t particularly difficult to see their surroundings.

They had just walked down when they heard strange noises behind them. Guo Ran screamed. Not that far from him, a strange lifeform suddenly appeared.

Guo Ran instinctively summoned his armor and hacked his saber at this lifeform.

When the spark flew, that lifeform quivered ever so slightly, while Guo Ran was tumbling back. Uncle Tree had to catch him and drag him back, countering the power. It was only thanks to him that Guo Ran didn’t cough up blood.

Because of the sparks, everyone managed to see what Guo Ran had attacked. It was a lifeform in ancient battle armor, its body gaunt and its eyes sealed shut. It was completely devoid of life.

Its general form resembled that of a human, with limbs and proportions akin to one. Yet, a horn protruding from its head indicated its non-human origin.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Guo Ran’s attack only caused its body to sway, and it ignored Long Chen. Its legs were dragging across the ground as it continued walking.

“What kind of lifeform is this?! How is it so powerful?!” exclaimed Guo Ran. He had not been holding back with his last attack, but he was unable to damage this lifeform in the slightest.

In fact, all he caused was the slightest mark on its armor, a mark as fine as a strand of hair. It was impossible to notice it without looking.

“This person was a Heaven Venerate when he was alive. Furthermore, he should be considered a very strong existence amongst Heaven Venerates,” said Uncle Tree as he examined this lifeform.

“A Heaven Venerate corpse!”

They were all startled. They had only experienced just how terrifying Heaven Venerates were. So, why was there a Heaven Venerate corpse here? Could it be that Heaven Venerates were actually all over the place?

The sound that they had been hearing came from its feet dragging across the ground. This lifeform’s posture was bizarre. It was moving slowly, as if every step was laborious.

Just then, they saw another strange lifeform in the distance. Just like this one, it was dragging its feet, its movements odd.

Long Chen observed that their footsteps maintained a consistent and uniform distance from one another. Each step was flawlessly identical.

Suddenly, Long Chen saw that these lifeforms seemed to be holding something. Also, they were expressionlessly walking in one direction.

Long Chen beckoned everyone, and they rushed off in the direction those lifeforms were going. Before long, they encountered a barrier obstructing their path. Beyond the barrier stood an imposing figure.

At the sight of this entity, Long Chen's very soul quivered, and even Uncle Tree's countenance shifted.

“An expert from the primal chaos era!”
