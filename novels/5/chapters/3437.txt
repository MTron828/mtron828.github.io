Chapter 3426 You’re Too Naive

BOOM!

The eighth prince raised his arms to block Long Chen’s kick. At this moment, the void shuddered and cracks appeared in the air.

The weight of Long Chen’s foot was like the pressure of an entire world. As a result, the eighth prince’s arms shuddered and his body began to sink. The void rumbled as if it was about to explode.

“The Mammoth Divine Elephant race is nothing more than a bug in front of the true dragon race. What right do you have to be arrogant?” Long Chen was frowning with anger. Now, his golden dragon scales were shining brightly, and his body was like the sun.

“You’re just a little human! You were only lucky to obtain true dragon essence blood, but you dare to act arrogant in front of me?!”

The eighth prince was enraged. Affected by the dragon might, his spiritual fluctuations were growing unsteady. It was affecting his combat power.

The Mammoth Divine Elephant race might be considered an ancient species, but in front of the true dragon, its bloodline was still suppressed. It didn’t matter how strong he was. In front of the divine might of a true dragon, he would always feel uneasy. That one bit of unease resulted in him being unable to unleash his full potential.

Long Chen pressed down with his foot, and the eighth prince sank into the ground. Everyone could see that in terms of pure power, the eighth prince was a level weaker than Long Chen.

Just then, Wu Ying and the other experts that had been inside the barrier began to creep closer.

“Scram! He’s just a lowly human! I don’t need anyone else’s help!” shouted the eighth prince. He had his own pride and didn’t want others to interfere in his battle.

His Mammoth Divine Elephant race was claimed to be number one in power. No one could even come close to them. But now a human was suppressing him; he could not accept it.

“It was nothing more than luck! Do you think that relying on dragon might to suppress me will leave me helpless?! You’re too naive!”

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosive sound rang out within the eighth prince’s body. It was like something had shattered and endless power gushed out of his body. Long Chen was instantly forced back by that wave of power.

Rumbling rang out. After that, lightning rained down from the heavens, and the eighth prince’s body rapidly absorbed it. His aura crazily grew.

He had actually started his tribulation. Due to the dragon might’s suppression, he had no choice but to do this. Only after he advanced to the Divine Lord realm could he fight under its suppression.

Influenced by him, the other experts also broke through their shackles and started their tribulations.

“Eighth prince, kill him quickly! Perhaps if you kill him now, the Heavenly Dao mark can be taken back,” shouted the expert from the Golden Barbarian Bull race.

The Heavenly Dao mark had been absorbed by Long Chen. Killing him now might cause it to be free for grabs again.

Lei Yuner was also undergoing her tribulation. But she was further away, not knowing if she should come help Long Chen or not.

“Yuner, call your friends. Tell them to get as far away from here as possible,” transmitted Long Chen.

Just then, the eighth prince came charging over. “Your dragon might is useless against me! Let’s see just how you will fight me now!”

Wu Ying and the others had surrounded them. Furthermore, various experts from the large demonic beast races were summoned, and they formed a giant encirclement.

Clearly, these experts wanted to trap Long Chen here so that he couldn’t flee. They viewed the Heavenly Dao mark that he had just obtained as a must-have.

That Heavenly Dao mark might have been absorbed, but as long as Long Chen didn’t finish his tribulation, it wouldn’t merge with him perfectly. If he was killed before going through his tribulation, there was still a chance that they could obtain it.

“If a person wants to die, not even a god can save them.”

BOOM!

Long Chen snorted. An explosive sound then rang out from within his body. After that, endless power flooded every inch of him.

His flesh, his meridians, and his souls were like deserts that were finally nourished by water. They crazily grew in power.

His 108,000 stars quivered and cracked apart. At the same time, Long Chen felt endless energy crazily being absorbed out of heaven and earth and pouring into the stars.

The stars repeatedly broke and grew, broke and grew, repeatedly getting stronger. They were absorbing the outside world’s power to strengthen themselves.

Furthermore, at this moment, Long Chen’s body became so full of explosive power that it felt like if he didn’t release it, he would explode.

Seeing the eighth prince charging at him, he unleashed a single punch.

BOOM!

The earth shook. The eighth prince came charging in aggressively, only to be sent flying by Long Chen’s punch. He then smashed into the encirclement of demonic beasts, leaving a bloody path of death in their midst.

Wu Ying and the others were shocked. Now that Long Chen was making his breakthrough into the Divine Lord realm, he seemed like a different person. His aura was as vast as a sea, and his might shook the heavens. It was as if the very heavens were about to collapse, as if the world was turning dark.

However, very quickly, they noticed that it wasn’t as if the world was turning dark. The world really was getting dark.

They then looked up. The sky was originally filled with lightning. But now, there was simply an endless sea of black clouds.

The roaring lightning above their heads seemed to have lost all their power. They were like rabbits that had been baring their claws only for a wild dragon to slowly approach them. They cowered.

“What is that?”

Everyone within and outside the Divine Lord Immortal Realm was stunned. Those black clouds covering the sky made even World Kings quiver. They had never seen such a terrifying heavenly tribulation before.

The tribulation clouds completely covered up everyone else’s tribulation cloud. In fact, they even covered up the entire Divine Lord Immortal Realm.

Other people’s tribulation clouds were normally violet, but these tribulation clouds were pitch black. Some of the experts undergoing tribulation suddenly found that the lightning crashing toward them became weak and dissipated. Their lightning then merged into those black clouds and vanished, being absorbed by these domineering black clouds.

Those experts undergoing tribulation were dumbfounded. They hadn’t finished having the lightning temper their bodies before their tribulations ended. They couldn’t break through like this.

The black tribulations slowly curled together. At the center, a giant vortex appeared and it was like an eye staring at Long Chen.

“Heavens, it’s Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation!”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Only then did those World Kings react. They were filled with disbelief.
