Chapter 4653 Settling Karma

“It really did appear. In the end, you can’t run from karma.”

When Long Chen saw that claw, his heart sank. Despite his hopes, the very thing he had been worried about had materialized before him.

BOOM!

The dragon claw crashed down as if it was trying to destroy the very world, tearing through the tribulation clouds. What struck the Dragonblood Legion with unparalleled terror was the draconic might emanating from the claw—a force that rattled their very souls, as if it would wrench their souls from their bodies.

To the horror of the Dragonblood warriors, the dragon claw penetrated through the protective barrier that had withstood the relentless assault of the lightning beasts. It instantly crumbled before the might of the dragon claw.

Within the barrier, the Dragonblood warriors shuddered and coughed up blood. Even with all of them enduring this attack together, they were unable to stop it.

“It’s that senior of the Sovereign clan!”

Guo Ran and the others’ expressions changed. Having fought against this expert inside the dragon nest, they were extremely sensitive to his aura.

“This is the final wave! Go all out!” shouted Gu Yang.

BOOM!

Just as he shouted, a large and muscular figure with a crown appeared in front of him and unleashed a punch aimed straight at his face.

This formidable opponent was none other than the expert from the Sovereign clan they had previously confronted, replicated by the heavenly tribulation.

Faced with the sheer terror of the incoming punch, Gu Yang hesitated to directly block it. However, much to his astonishment, he found himself involuntarily drawn toward the fist, unable to resist its pull.

“Careful!”

Seeing Gu Yang in danger, Guo Ran was the first to react. He actually used his own back to withstand that attack for Gu Yang.

BOOM!

The Sovereign clan expert’s fist smashed into Guo Ran’s back, crushing his triple-layer scale armor. Blood then sprayed out of Guo Ran’s mouth, and he smashed into Gu Yang. The impact sent both of them tumbling back.

“Guo Ran!”

Gu Yang was shocked. When Guo Ran smashed into him, it was with such power that it left Gu Yang dazed. Guo Ran had endured around ninety percent of the attack’s power, leaving Gu Yang to endure only a fraction of it. Hence, Gu Yang was extremely worried about Guo Ran.

As Guo Ran coughed up blood, Gu Yang breathed a sigh of relief. The thought of Guo Ran perishing at that moment filled Gu Yang with a sense of dread. He knew would never be able to rest in peace if that happened.

“Hehe, I, Guo Ran, am unrivaled in defense! That punch was just an itch!” declared Guo Ran as he continued to cough blood.

Gu Yang looked at Guo Ran’s back and saw that his scale armor had a large hole in it now. That attack had almost blown him apart.

“Good brother. Rest, and leave the rest to us!” Gu Yang patted Guo Ran’s chest and charged back.

Just then, multiple rays of divine light fell on Guo Ran, reinvigorating him and healing his wounds rapidly.

The healing warriors finally had a chance to use their techniques again, yet Guo Ran’s wounds were so severe that they couldn’t heal him in an instant. However, having recovered enough to fight, Guo Ran charged out again.

Guo Ran had no choice but to go out right away. After all, no one else in this tribulation could possibly block an attack from the Sovereign clan’s expert.

The Dragonblood warriors were charging at the Sovereign clan expert, but they were all sent flying in droves. They weren’t a match for him.

It seemed that the replicated Sovereign clan expert was even stronger than the one they had fought in the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. With a wave of his hand, a wave of lightning exploded. They were unable to even get close to him.

“Watch out above you!” Long Chen suddenly shouted.

Just then, the Dragonblood warriors were shocked to see an enormous dragon head appear in the sky, its gaping maw directed toward them.

Before Long Chen’s warning, they hadn’t even noticed it, as all their attention was on the Sovereign clan expert. Seeing the dragon head and the sphere of lightning condensing inside its mouth, they felt like their souls would flee their bodies.

Their horror deepened as they realized the truth: the Sovereign clan expert possessed his own manifestation. The initial dragon claw attack had not originated from him but from this manifestation. Hence, they didn’t just have to fight the Sovereign clan expert but also his manifestation.

Even the Sovereign clan expert alone was enough to make them beg for mercy, so the addition of his manifestation just sank their chance of survival to zero.

All of them were left stunned. Despite their extensive combat experience and their usual fearlessness in the face of death, they couldn’t muster any semblance of calm or rational thought in this dire moment. They couldn’t think of any way of fighting back.

The sphere of lightning within the dragon’s mouth expanded rapidly, crackling with energy as lightning runes condensed within its core. Multicolored lightning danced within the sphere, emitting an ear-piercing sound that was like the overture of death and destruction. In front of it, the Dragonblood warriors felt as tiny as ants.

Guo Ran was also dumbfounded. Although he had managed to withstand an attack from the Sovereign clan expert, saving Gu Yang, he knew he wouldn’t be able to block this one.

Even if sacrificed himself, he wouldn’t be able to. Now, there was nothing he could do to stop the Dragonblood Legion from being destroyed.

“What do we do?!”

Even Yue Zifeng was sweating as he could clearly sense the destructive power within that sphere of lightning.

If he were to attack it with all his power, perhaps he would be able to cut it apart, but that would be meaningless. The power inside of the sphere was concentrated to the pinnacle. Even if he managed to cleave through it, the lightning would still descend upon them, resulting in certain death.

At this moment, the rest of the Dragonblood warriors launched all-out attacks on the Sovereign clan expert. All they could do was prevent him from disturbing Yue Zifeng, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others.

Despite facing the brink of destruction numerous times, the Dragonblood Legion never wavered. They knew their duty and placed their trust in their leaders, so they did what they had to do.

However, at this time, Guo Ran, Yue Zifeng, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan didn’t know what to do. In front of this destructive divine ability that was still accumulating power, they couldn’t think of anything.

“Boss!” Guo Ran shouted. Long Chen was now their greatest hope. If they wanted to survive this, they probably needed Long Chen’s help, which might cause an even greater calamity. However, they could only deal with that when the time came.

“Xiaole, it’s time for you to shine.” Long Chen called out to the panicking Bai Xiaole.

“Me?” Bai Xiaole was flabbergasted.

“Don’t doubt yourself. You are the only one who can resolve this crisis!” shouted Long Chen.

Buzz.

Suddenly, the dragon head flashed, its massive maw widening as the enormous lightning sphere hurtled toward them like a falling star.
