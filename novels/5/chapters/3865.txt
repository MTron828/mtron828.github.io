Chapter 3854 World Extermination Snow Lotus

This spear was condensed of violet blood runes. As Long Aotian’s seven-color Supreme Blood was exhausted, he switched to his violet blood.

Long Aotian was too powerful. He possessed dual Supreme Blood, with both being the unmatched type. Either one could be used to dominate the world, yet he actually possessed two.

Legend had it that the Violet Blood race was a race chosen by the heavens. Their essence blood was innately a miniature version of the Heavenly Daos. It was divine blood that was closest to the laws of the Heavenly Daos.

When the violet blood appeared, the power of the Heavenly Daos converged. The void was constantly being broken, unable to contain the power of this violet spear.

Facing it, Long Chen put away the Minghong Saber. The next moment, a flame lotus appeared in his left hand, and a sphere of lightning appeared in his right hand. He actually summoned both the World Extermination Flame Lotus and the World Extermination Lightning Radiance at once.

Flames soared and lightning thundered. Long Chen smashed the two together in a forceful merger.

“You idiot!”

This attack caused the dragon expert to curse. The current Long Chen didn’t have much energy left. It was not at all suitable to go for a direct clash.

If Long Chen instead used his lightning and flame energy to defend, creating a solid defense that exhausted all the energy of Long Aotian’s essence blood, he would definitely save a great deal of energy.

However, instead of saving energy defending, he had chosen to face an attack with another attack. He was completely wasting this opportunity.

When the lightning and flame energy crashed into the spear, the spear collapsed. Long Aotian then hacked up blood and was blown back.

As for Long Chen, he was no better off. He coughed up blood, and his arms were a bloody pulp. Even his bones were exposed.

Long Chen once more drew on the primal chaos space’s life energy to recover, but he was shocked to find that there was no longer any life energy to draw out.

When he looked inside, he found that the Wood Foundation Divine Trees were withered and the medicinal plants were listless. Even the Devil Eye Water Lilies had wilted and simply lay in the water, exhausted.

The entire primal chaos space was dried up. Only then did Long Chen think of how he had repeatedly drawn on this life energy in his fight against Long Aotian. He hadn’t even realized that he had used up all his life energy reserve.

At this moment, the only living vegetations were the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, the Heavenly Dao Tree, and the sprouts of the Moon Trees. The rest had all withered.

This battle had truly been intense. So many immemorial corpses were devoured, unleashing an ocean’s worth of life energy, but it was all used up.

“It’s time to end things.”

Long Chen took a deep breath and formed hand seals. The next moment, lightning raged, forming a sea of lightning within this world. As a result, the aura of heavenly tribulation unfurled, and the destructive will of the Heavenly Daos descended.

Lei Linger appeared, holding a lightning sword. Immersed within this sea of lightning, she raised her sword, and that sea of lightning was sucked up by her sword.

Lei Linger didn’t say any vicious words. She directly hacked down her sword.

Long Aotian had just exchanged a brute force attack with Long Chen, so he was still coughing up blood. Seeing Lei Linger coming for him, he raised his hand. His violet blood spear once more appeared.

BOOM!

The violet blood spear was shattered by Lei Linger’s attack. Long Aotian had been exhausted, while Lei Linger was unleashing all her power in one attack. She even borrowed Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength.

At this moment, Lei Linger’s sword struck Long Aotian’s head. Everyone thought that he was definitely dead.

However, just as Lei Linger’s sword touched Long Aotian’s head, a golden imperial crown appeared on his head, blocking her attack.

Following the appearance of the golden crown, golden scales covered Long Aotian’s body. He was quickly completely covered.

All of a sudden, an ancient and sacred aura erupted. Lei Linger’s body was actually blasted apart by that aura, transforming into lightning runes.

“Big brother Long Chen…!”

Lei Linger once more took human form and returned to Long Chen’s side with a shocked expression. She hadn’t had any ability to resist that power just now.

“That isn’t his power. It should be the immemorial Long clan’s life-saving trump card. I knew that the Long clan wouldn’t let him die.” Long Chen looked sharply at the Long Aotian that was wrapped in golden light.

“Let me go, big brother Long Chen. Give me all your Spiritual Strength, and we’ll use the Nirvana Scripture together. I will unleash the power of the Ice Soul in the World Extermination Flame Lotus. That will definitely kill him,” said Huo Linger.

The current Long Chen still had eighty percent of his Spiritual Strength. Just now, he had only split a portion for Lei Linger because he had had a feeling that Long Aotian wouldn’t be so easy to kill.

This premonition was not wrong. Long Aotian still had a trump card. When this golden crown and armor appeared, a figure appeared in his manifestation.

This figure was blurry, looking to be an elder. But his face was unclear and he gave off an exceedingly ancient and dignified aura.

As Long Aotian’s aura was infected by him, golden light filled this world. This powerful aura then pressed against everyone.

“Long Chen, I told you that you were definitely dead today! Now, do you have anything else to say?!”

Wrapped in this golden light, Long Aotian’s voice was like that of a god and resounded throughout this world. Even his voice had become a bit ancient and bloody.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Moreover, Long Aotian’s injuries were already fully healed. It was like he was reborn, and his aura was even stronger than before. At this moment, Yin Changsheng and the others’ expressions all changed. Long Aotian was practically a monster. His trump cards were limitless.

“You’ve already lost. You are simply relying on external power to save yourself. However, you still have the face to act arrogant? How can a loser who has fully lost still be so arrogant? I really admire that shamelessness. To be able to eat your own shit so easily, I will never be able to match you in this regard,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“A person about to die also dares to say such words? Go cry in the other world.”

As Long Aotian formed hand seals, the figure behind him moved, and a fist came out of that illusory manifestation. An ancient aura then unfurled, filling with an undying divine radiance. Even before this fist landed, the world began to sink. This was a killer blow.

“Long Chen, I will help you block this attack. Go grab the cauldron.” The dragon expert’s voice rang out.

“No. I will take the cauldron and kill him myself.”

Long Chen and Huo Linger formed hand seals and chanted, emitting the holy sound of the Nirvana Scripture. A snow-white flame lotus then appeared.

This flame lotus rapidly grew. Just before the fist landed, it was fully formed.

“Go! World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

Long Chen and Huo Linger’s hand seals changed one final time, and this snow lotus crashed into the fist with boundless divine might. This attack was Huo Linger’s full-power attack. She didn’t hold anything back.
