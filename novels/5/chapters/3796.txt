Chapter 3785 Primal Chaos Era’s Dragon Scale

Long Chen couldn’t be bothered with saving his transportation talismans and directly used seventeen of them. Only once they were truly far from the Heavenly River Blood Sea did he and Jiang Lei begin flying on their own.

Fortunately, after becoming an Immortal King, Long Chen’s spiritual perception was far stronger than before. He could sense the holes in the encirclement of the demonic beasts, so he directly escaped without a trace. Otherwise, they would have been noticed by the Divine Venerates, and then it would have been dangerous.

However, Long Chen was extremely disappointed with his advancement to the Immortal King realm this time. Other than his spiritual yuan growing immensely, he didn’t sense much of a change otherwise.

“Senior, are you still there? What is going on?” asked Long Chen. He couldn’t help calling out to the dragon expert. This heavenly tribulation had truly been a mess.

“Don’t panic. Everything is within expectations. There are many places to undergo tribulation in the three thousand worlds, but the reason I had you undergo tribulation there is to prepare for what is coming,” replied the dragon expert in the end.

“Preparation?”

“I had you absorb the essence blood of those Beast Venerates in order to widen your meridians. You have gone off the original path of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, walking your own path. Furthermore, you only have the most basic Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, lacking the corresponding Battle Skills. Thus, you are far weaker than those nine star heirs from the immemorial era,” said the dragon expert.

“Senior, you… you know the secrets of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art?” Long Chen hadn’t expected this.

“But of course. However, you shouldn’t ask any questions that you shouldn’t. I won’t answer. It is because your Nine Star Hegemon Body Art has gone down different paths that your fate has changed. But who can say whether this change is for good or bad? In any case, there’s no going back. Since you have chosen to change it, you can only continue down this path. I have helped you pave a path, but I also can’t see the end of this path. You should be mentally prepared,” said the dragon expert.

“Senior, don’t worry. This life of mine was saved by you. Even if I die on this path, I won’t blame you in the slightest,” promised Long Chen.

“I have only paved the slightest bit of this path by using the essence blood of one billion demonic beasts to widen your meridians. Furthermore, the nine star heirs then used the power of the heavenly tribulation to completely purify those essence bloods. This is why you feel like your current Blood Qi is so deficient. In truth, your dragon blood energy has not weakened. But your meridians are over ten times wider, so you feel like it is severely deficient,” explained the dragon expert.

Through this explanation, Long Chen realized that it was precisely as the dragon expert said. It wasn’t that his Blood Qi was weak but that his meridians were shockingly wide. When he circulated his Blood Qi, he felt like the channels were empty, making him feel weak.

It seemed that after the essence blood of those demonic beasts fulfilled their purpose, the nine star heirs directly erased it. His meridians were then further widened by the tribulation’s energy, and they also grew tougher.

“Senior, this is the preparation for absorbing your essence blood?” asked Long Chen, suddenly comprehending it.

“Correct. Without powerful meridians, there is no way for you to merge with my essence blood. Even with your physical body, your odds of success were less than ten percent. Furthermore, I know how proud you are. You will not accept defeat and would throw your life away on it. Anyway, widening your meridians is not just for merging with my essence blood. Your astral energy and violet qi all need stronger meridians to control. If you wish to summon the Seven Star Battle Armor, without tough enough meridians, the power of your stars will directly blow you up. How will you fight then?”

Hearing that, Long Chen had the urge to slap himself. How could he have been so foolish as to not think of this step?

In order to be safe, Long Chen directly returned to the Spirit race’s territory. As soon as he arrived, the Spirit race’s leader personally came to welcome him. Long Chen then said that he needed a place to enter seclusion.

The Spirit race’s leader directly transported him to a secluded place deep within the Spirit race’s territory. Long Chen then had Jiang Lei consume some pills to stabilize his realm and absorb the energy of heaven and earth. He could circulate his thunderforce as Blood Qi within his meridians. That way, he would acquire a heavenly lightning body.

Jiang Lei was delighted by that. He had relied too much on his Blood Qi before and hadn’t thought of this. He immediately entered seclusion.

Just like Jiang Lei, Long Chen had also not thought of this. Seeing Jiang Lei’s worshipful expression, Long Chen had the urge to dig a hole for himself.

“When you condensed your battle armor before, you did it forcefully. Now, you can draw the violet qi of your starry sea into your meridians. Using the Seven Star Battle Armor should be easier that way.”

Long Chen formed hand seals, and violet qi slowly floated out of his 108,000 stars. When they entered his meridians, his body quivered. He felt endless power rising within him.

“This violet qi is even stronger than my Blood Qi!” Long Chen was delighted. When this violet qi poured through his meridians, he felt endless power.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Fuck, if I had thought of this, why would I have needed to run?! I’d have directly killed them all!” Sensing the power of his violet qi when it circulated through his meridians, Long Chen felt a burst of regret. Why hadn’t he thought of this back then?

He hadn’t thought of using his violet qi this way. With this ample violet qi, violet mist began to appear around his body. With every wave of his hand, heaven and earth quivered. It was as if the laws of the ten thousand Daos were under his control.

“Don’t get too happy. Even with your meridians widened, they still aren’t tough enough. There is still the danger of dying to my essence blood. Before this, your chance of success was only ten percent. Now, it is at most fifty percent. To put it frankly, you could die as well,” said the dragon expert, dumping a basin of ice water over Long Chen’s head.

“Your essence blood is really that terrifying?” Long Chen gasped.

A dragon king was equivalent to the human race’s Immortal King realm. They were in the same realm. If it really was as the dragon expert said, then just how terrifying was this existence?

“When I became a dragon king, it was still the primal chaos era. The laws of heaven and earth were complete, and spiritual qi was overflowing back then. But your era is different. Furthermore, when I became a dragon king, I swept across all those before me, showing an overwhelming brilliance. My arrogance soared beyond the clouds, so that dragon scale contains my haughty will from back then. When the scale fell from my body, it produced its own consciousness. Even I cannot forcibly make it lower its head. Thus, if you want to subdue, you need a powerful will, as well as powerful meridians to contain the essence blood. When it comes to the will, I’m not worried about you. But your meridians are still lacking quite a bit compared to me from back then. I’m worried that your body will explode. Thus, you should first use your violet qi and astral energy to once more widen your meridians before they are fully set. Once you have widened them to the limit, condense the Seven Star Battle Armor and widen them again. If you can reach the level that I expect, you should have a ninety percent chance of subduing my dragon scale,” said the dragon expert.

Hearing all of this, Long Chen was dumbfounded. He had always been very confident in himself. However, this confidence was badly battered by the dragon expert’s words.

Long Chen clenched his teeth and took a deep breath. He began to use his full power to widen his meridians. He knew that he would fully transform this time in the three thousand worlds.

No wonder the dragon expert had not mentioned using his violet qi to widen his meridians before. Its goal was for Long Chen to gain the power of its physical body and crush Kun Tu with just that physical strength.

“Kun Tu, just wait.” As soon as he thought of Kun Tu’s haughty appearance, Long Chen had the urge to beat him up.

After forming hand seals, Long Chen’s starry sea quivered. Astral energy poured through his meridians.
