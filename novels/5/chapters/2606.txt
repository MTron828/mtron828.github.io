Chapter 2595 Once More Going to the Corrupt God Cemetery

“I don’t believe you.” Long Chen looked at Mo Nian disdainfully. “At the very least, there is one object that you haven’t taken out. Where is the Beitang family’s weapon? If you take it for yourself, do you think Beitang Rushuang will let you off?”

Mo Nian then tossed out a few more divine items and directly stormed off. Amongst those new divine items was an ancient multi-colored bow.

Seeing Mo Nian toss over so many divine items, Qu Jianying felt bad. “Long Chen, Mo Nian risked his life to enter Resentful Death City and brought back these treasures with his own power. Don’t you think it’s going overboard to take them all?”

“Overboard? No, you don’t know Mo Nian. He definitely hasn’t taken out even half of the things he got,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen truly understood Mo Nian. Although he was generous in other areas, he was a stingy miser when it came to the profits of his graverobbing. Taking those from him was like cutting his flesh.

Why did Long Chen know? It was because Mo Nian had once shown Long Chen his treasure room, a place that not even Liu Zongying knew of. Inside, there were millions of museum pieces he had collected.

They were the results of Mo Nian’s graverobbing over the years, and he had detailed classifications of them, including their uses, age, etc. Long Chen had even spotted something that looked like a woman’s undergarment.

In any case, this fellow was very unwilling to take out the results of his graverobbing. He liked to conceal them and keep them for himself, calling it by the glorified name of archaeology and protecting the treasures of the continent’s ancestral figures.

The reason Long Chen had repeatedly squeezed Mo Nian of his treasures just now was because it would be a waste to conceal such priceless treasures. However, now that Mo Nian had spat out so many terrifying divine items, Long Chen felt confident that Mo Nian knew how serious their predicament was. He wouldn’t conceal such terrifying divine items.

Whether he left them to the Martial Heaven Alliance or to Mo Gate’s disciples, it was all the same.

“This is truly stunning. So many experts died in Resentful Death City.” The old man looked at those divine items in disbelief.

These divine items were all famous existences, and their original masters were experts that had stood at the peak of the continent. Thinking of how they had all died in Resentful Death City, he was alarmed. Just what kind of secret was hiding in Resentful Death City?

“The Nangong and Beitang families’ divine items naturally must be returned to them. The Dongfang family’s Scarlet Tomb Saber should be left to a saber master. As for the Ximen family’s Dragon Claw…” Qu Jianying looked at Long Chen.

The Ximen family had been enemies with Long Chen at the start, but later, perhaps due to their conscience or because they couldn’t stop Long Chen, they had decided to join the neutral side.

Even after multiple battles, the Ximen family had chosen to remain neutral. However, there were times that they had spoken up for the side of the Martial Heaven Continent. In the Star Field Divine World, Ximen Tianxiong had cursed Dongfang Yuyang’s actions. Thus, the Ximen family could not be said to be the Martial Heaven Alliance’s enemy.

“You can do whatever you want. Don’t look at me. I’m not good at politics,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen nodded. As his cultivation base grew, Qu Jianying was less strict with him. It was no longer like she was the parent scolding a child.

However, with this respect came distance as well. It was the old man and Qu Jianying who were the same from the start. There was cursing and fighting, but in Long Chen’s view, this showed that they were actually closer. Perhaps this was why the old man would never be suited to being in command.

Qu Jianying nodded and respectfully put away the divine items. Since Mo Nian didn’t know their history, then fine. But Qu Jianying had grown up with stories of these legendary figures. These seniors had spilled their blood for the Martial Heaven Continent, so they had to be treated respectfully.

After putting away the divine items, Qu Jianying was on the move to send them to the right people when she recalled the other matter. She told Long Chen about the matter of the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

“The Blood Fiend Devil Lord?” Long Chen was startled. Even Sovereign sprouts were willing to be his guards and all the experts of the Dragonblood Legion were unable to stop him from leaving? This person was definitely shockingly powerful.

Long Chen knew that the current Dragonblood Legion was extremely powerful, but he hadn’t expected them to draw out such a terrifying existence.

“He is most likely the son of the world. To be more precise, he has started walking the path of becoming a Sovereign. He is most definitely the Sovereign of his generation. As for the Martial Heaven Continent, we have some Sovereign sprouts, but not one person has shown signs of being the true Sovereign. It’s worrisome,” sighed Qu Jianying.

The blood sun behind the Blood Fiend Devil Lord was the best indicator that he was the next Sovereign. Legend had it that when Sovereigns were rising, they had different manifestations, which were supported by the entire world.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord had appeared, but there was no one similar to him on the Martial Heaven Continent. This fact made the people panic. Even though Long Chen was powerful, he wasn’t supported by the full power of the Martial Heaven Continent, so how could he fight the Blood Fiend Devil Lord?

Furthermore, the information that Mo Nian had brought back implied that Ye Ming was also undergoing a similar transformation. He might become the second Blood Fiend Devil Lord, and this news pressed heavily on their hearts. Moreover, Resentful Death City made Qu Jianying extremely uneasy.

“What’s there to be afraid of? No matter what scheme they have, all we can do is fight to the death. Why worry so much?” said the old man.

Qu Jianying glared at the old man. This recklessness was something she was unable to achieve.

“Long Chen, what do you think?” asked Qu Jianying.

“Not much. I agree with the old man. All we can do is work hard at improving ourselves. If the Martial Heaven Continent is truly fated to be destroyed, then small figures like us won’t be able to stop it. All I can do is risk my life to stop those trying to destroy my family. If I kill one, I go even; if I kill two, I’ll have profited,” said Long Chen.

The old man laughed and nodded. This thinking was to his taste. People were born in the world, so they should live to the fullest while they were still alive. What will come will come in the end. Did worrying about it bring anything good?

Qu Jianying sighed. These two were both unreasonable. If she tried to talk reason with them, her words would only fall on deaf ears.

“I’m going to leave and discuss this with Li Tianxuan first. Sigh, I can’t be bothered to speak to you two,” said Qu Jianying.

“Alliance head, I suddenly recall that there’s something important I need to discuss with you,” said Long Chen.

“What?” asked Qu Jianying, pausing.

“Ah… about that… Lingshan has most likely brought it up to you. It’s to give some joy to the Martial Heaven Alliance at this time…”

Qu Jianying immediately turned red and cursed, “Little bastard, all you think about is nonsense. We have more important things to do. If you keep spouting nonsense, I’ll tear up that broken mouth of yours.”

Qu Jianying ran off, almost fleeing. After that, Long Chen turned to the old man and saw that his expression was complicated.

“What, are you of the same mind? That doesn’t seem to be your style,” said Long Chen.

The old man sighed and patted his shoulder. “Child, I know your heart. Lingshan has also brought it up to me. Thinking about this life, I owe Jianying a great deal. When I was young, I didn’t understand. When I understood, I was already old. I’ve also decided on it. When the dark era is over, we’ll have the grandest wedding ceremony to make up for what I owe her.”

Long Chen nodded. “Old man, I’ve essentially learned the ninth form of Split the Heavens, and the finer details are things I have to figure out for myself. Now, I’m thinking of visiting the High Priest to see what he is thinking.”

The old man pondered over this and eventually nodded. Due to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, Long Chen was unable to use the ninth form of Split the Heavens in the same way, so it would be better for him to slowly test it for himself.

After that, Long Chen left the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect and flew through the endless black clouds on a flying boat. A sharp light then appeared in his eyes.

“The dark era. There’s no longer a day or night. Perhaps there’s sunlight right behind the black clouds, but no one knows when the clouds will disperse. No one knows if they’ll live to see the sunlight again. The darkness brings despair… but why is it that I like black so much?” Long Chen stared at the black clouds, not feeling oppressed by them. Instead, he felt a strange kind of ease.

“Perhaps your inner heart is already black,” said Evilmoon indifferently.

“Tch, your dark evil dragon race is the blackest one. Are you trying to praise me?” Long Chen curled his lips.

“Our darkness has a bottom line. I’m not someone who pisses and craps on others. Clearly, you have no bottom line,” cursed Evilmoon. It seemed it was recalling how Long Chen had threatened to poop on it to make it lower its head.

“I don’t believe it. My heart is filled with sunlight. I love life, so how could I be such a dark person?” said Long Chen.

“Pah. Why do you like wearing black? Isn’t it to conceal your own darkness? If you wore white, your inner darkness would be set off by contrast, and you wouldn’t be able to endure it yourself,” sneered Evilmoon.

“Impossible. Have I been affected by you without realizing it?” wondered Long Chen.

“Dogshit. Don’t blame others for your own crap. I’m the one affected by you. I find myself… Well, whatever, I’m not going to argue with you. Just remember, humans have two sides. The you that you see might not be your true self. If you face the sunlight, you will only see the parts of you that are bright. But you don’t know that the shadow behind you can cover up the entire world,” said Evilmoon. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“What is that supposed to mean?” asked Long Chen. It seemed that what Evilmoon said had a deeper meaning.

“Find a way to see yourself clearly, or when you use the ninth form of Split the Heavens, I’ll be overwhelmed by your darkness. Then you will also lose control. You can’t just rely on me to control your emotions. You have to control them yourself,” warned Evilmoon.

“Alright. I understand.” Long Chen nodded. Lately, he had truly been dependent on Evilmoon, Ling-er, and the Heaven Flipping Seal. That wasn’t a good thing.

“Aren’t you going to the Wine God Palace? Why did you come here?” asked Evilmoon suddenly.

A dark world appeared before them. The aura of death filled this place, and the surrounding mountains had long since lost any greenery. This was the entrance to the Corrupt God Cemetery.
