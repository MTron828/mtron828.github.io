“Four Divine Beast Golden Body!”

This time, even the head judge was moved. He felt disbelief when he saw those four balls of light behind Chu Kuang.

As the four balls of light appeared, golden runes lit up around Chu Kuang’s body. It was as if his body was made of gold, emitting dazzling golden light.

Moreover, when he summoned the Four Divine Beast Golden Body, his power erupted like a volcano. His aura shook the very heavens.

As a result, the experts throughout the plaza were all stupefied. How could Chu Kuang have hidden his true power so deeply?

“It’s over. Wasn’t the Four Divine Beast Golden Body a technique that only the Chu family’s Four Peak experts could barely activate? Now that Chu Kuang has activated it, there’s no hope for Long Chen.” Luo Ning felt despair.

The Four Divine Beast Golden Body was something that caused an endless headache for the Luo family in their battles against the Chu family. After the Chu family was defeated the first time, they had come back with such a consummate technique.

With the support of their ancestral blood, they ignited their Blood Qi, allowing their power to soar to an unimaginable level.

This was the technique that allowed the Chu family to create a solid foundation for themselves again. However, it had harsh requirements. Normally, only a Four Peak expert could barely satisfy those requirements and cultivate this technique. But now Chu Kuang had done it in the Mortal Transcendence realm.

Seeing the golden light around Chu Kuang’s body and his raging Blood Qi that caused the air to shudder, Luo Bing and Luo Ning felt like they had fallen into a nightmare.

Chu Huairen smiled when he saw this technique. Clearly, he was the one clearest on Chu Kuang’s true power. It was due to this that he was so confident.

Moreover, seeing the head judge’s shocked expression, he was particularly satisfied.

Just as everyone’s gaze was focused on Chu Kuang, there was an elder outside of the plaza slowly sweeping the leaves on the ground with a broom.

The elder shook his head and sighed, “Destiny draws enemies together.”

Without even looking at the plaza, he continued sweeping, as if unconcerned with anything happening in the outside world.

Long Chen was also astonished by those lights. “This aura, it seems a bit similar to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but it’s extremely loathsome. This feeling, it seems as if…” A flicker of different killing intent shone in Long Chen’s eyes. He seemed to have found the reason why he instinctively loathed Chu Kuang.

“Long Chen!” Chu Kuang howled, and the golden light on his body erupted. At the same time, the ground beneath him split apart, and the rubble behind him exploded.

“Even before attacking, his aura can break mountains. Just what level has Chu Kuang’s power reached?”

The current Chu Kuang was surrounded by raging astral winds. It was as if his power could devour the heavens. Golden runes flowed like the tides around him, forming a golden sea.

Everything within this golden sea was affected. Even the earth began to collapse and sink. However, this golden domain stopped a few dozen miles from the altar, which showed that its range was limited.

Mu Qingyun stared in shock. She had never dreamed that Chu Kuang’s power would surpass everyone’s expectations by so much. Hence, her heart sank, feeling worried for Long Chen.

“Don’t worry. Leave things here to me. You just need to get the flag.”

Just as she was full of worry and searching for Long Chen’s figure within the golden sea, Long Chen’s voice rang out in her mind.

Mu Qingyun was startled. Long Chen was actually able to give her a spiritual transmission from so far away? Furthermore, he was still capable of keeping an eye on their side? Since this was the case, her confidence was boosted, and she felt like some kind of energy was poured into her. After that, she crazily attacked the barrier. Since Long Chen had left the flag to her, then even if she had to die, she would accomplish this mission.

“Long Chen, face your death!”

Chu Kuang suddenly stamped on the ground, causing a large hole to collapse. He shot toward Long Chen.

Due to how fast he was, he left behind a mass of afterimages behind him. By the time people reacted, he was already in front of Long Chen.

In the face of this furious assault, Long Chen’s body flickered. He narrowly dodged it, allowing the saber to strike the land and create another huge ditch.

Just at that moment, he slapped Chu Kuang in the face again. However, golden light exploded, and Long Chen was blown back at the same time as Chu Kuang.

After that, the two of them stabilized three hundred meters from each other. Long Chen shook out his hand. “Your skin really is thick. I actually can’t beat it.”

Just now, although his slap had landed, his palm became numb. It felt like needles were stabbing it. Clearly, this Four Divine Beast Golden Body didn’t just strengthen Chu Kuang’s physical body, but it also increased the power of his armor.

Chu Kuang was enraged. Although he wasn’t injured, he had been slapped in the face once again. This humiliation felt more unbearable than being killed for him.

“Die!”

Out of rage, Chu Kuang charged at Long Chen once more, and a blood-colored rune appeared in his eyes. As this happened, Long Chen’s body tightened. He was actually locked down by some mysterious energy.

Chu Kuang was aware of Long Chen’s extensive combat experience after having suffered at the latter’s hands multiple times. If he didn’t use this bloodline locking art of his, he wouldn’t be able to strike Long Chen.

However, using this technique increased the burning rate of his bloodline power.

“Try and dodge this!” roared Chu Kuang, his saber slashing through the air with a thunderous sound.

BOOM!

Being locked down, Long Chen couldn't dodge, so he smashed his spear toward Chu Kuang. As a result, when his spear met the saber, a giant explosion shook the land. Long Chen’s spear exploded.

As for Long Chen, he shot back and smashed into a steep cliff, creating a new human-shaped hole in it. Cracks then spread around this hole, covering the entire stone mountain.

“Long Chen!”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning covered their mouths, fraught with worry. Long Chen’s weapon was no divine spear, so it couldn’t block Chu Kuang’s saber.

Everyone fell deathly silent, looking at Long Chen who wasn’t moving.

“It couldn’t be… that he died?” Such a terrifying attack… If it was someone else, they would have died an unknown number of times.

However, all of a sudden, Long Chen began to move, and the cracks in the cliff spread. Just as Long Chen jumped out, the entire mountain collapsed.

“He didn’t die!” Seeing him walking out of the cliff, Luo Bing and Luo Ning cheered.
