Chapter 1215: Boat

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Swamps were everywhere in the deep area of the inner area of Universe Boat. Above it was the boundless Lava Ocean.

Hua! Hua! Hua!

Lots of lava fell from the sky, and it clotted before it reached the ground. It turned into black rocks, which grew softer. They flew like black mercury and formed the black swamp.

The Lava Ocean was at the top, and the black swamp was at the bottom. This was the infamous Flame Ice Region. As it was in the deepest part of the inner area, there were millions of dangerous places, which was why they were all given random names, but the dangers couldn’t be overlooked.

Gu! Gu! Gu!

Suddenly, bubbles started to show up on the black swamp. More and more bubbles showed up, and some black swamp water was blasted out. Ripples showed up on this area, and they spread.

Hua! Hua! Hua!

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

The black-swamp area started to tremble, and it was horrifying.

******

Around ten light years away from that area, a small but delicate palace with a steeple was floating. Inside the palace were three great beings. All of them had single-eye phantoms on their backs. Apparently, they were great beings from the Divine Eye clan!

A giant man in golden armor smiled. “Although it’s extremely dangerous in Flame Ice Region, the dangers can be identified. It’s a good place in Universe Boat. There are rarely any true treasures born, but every time one emerges, it’s at least a pinnacle domain type or palace type true treasure. Shadow Dust, I’m so jealous that you two are stationed here in the long term.”

“It’s indeed a great place, but there are also lots of powers here.” A small man from Divine Eye clan smirked. “The two holy land universes don’t care, yet several powers from the first universe era are also here. Are you really jealous, Golden Square?”

“Golden Square, let’s switch! Can we?” said a female from the Divine Eye clan in a loose black cape, smiling.

Shadow Dust Master and Sorcerer Sprite Master were two extremely powerful great beings from the Divine Eye clan. They were also partners. One of them was great at close combat, while the other was great at soul attack. They roamed Universe Ocean cooperating with each other, and they rarely met a match. Normally, they stayed in Flame Ice Region.

“No, I’m not going to switch.” The giant man in golden armor shook his head. “In the entire inner area of Universe Boat, there aren’t many good places that we Divine Eye clan know of. We spent a lot of energies finding that place. Though there aren’t as many valuables here as your place, it’s much safer!”

“You’re so timid.” Shadow Dust Master smirked.

Just when the female wanted to say something, she frowned.

Shadow Dust Master’s eyes gleamed as well, and he tried to sense it carefully.

“That direction!”

“It’s there!”

Shadow Dust Master and Sorcerer Sprite Master turned in the same direction, then made eye contact. They both knew that something had happened—something great happened!

“Do you want to go, Golden Square?” asked Shadow Dust Master.

“Congratulations. It seems that we’re about to get something,” said the golden-armored man. “Of course, I’ll go. Perhaps not only the Divine Eye clan is stationed there… You two alone might not be able to hold them. I’ll need to come and help.”

“We’ll give you benefits if you actually help us,” said Sorcerer Sprite Master. “But we won’t give you anything if you prove worthless. We need to make sure that you know this.”

“Of course.” The golden-armored man nodded.

“Let’s go!”

“Go!”

Sou!

The palace turned into a green light, and it moved forward in the space between the lava ocean and the black swamp.

******

In another space flew a pyramid-shaped building. Inside the pyramid, a bold man was drinking wine and looking outside through his palace true treasure. The horrible environment outside gave him chills.

“Huh?” The bold man frowned. “Is a new true treasure born? Am I really that lucky? I can’t believe I ran into something like this. I’ll go.”

Sou!

The pyramid sensed the direction and flew toward it.

******

The tiny, bloody light kept moving forward 100 times faster than light speed.

Inside the control room, Luo Feng sat looking at the outside. He held a cup of green tea in his hand, and there were engravings showing on his eyes. A small trace of godly power permeated.

“Huh?” Luo Feng’s eyes turned bright immediately. “Something special,” he whispered.

Space and time were very stable in dangerous places like Flame Ice Region. It was difficult for space and time to tremble.

“Have universe supreme masters used their power to break the laws? Is a true treasure born? Is a massive catastrophe coming?” whispered Luo Feng. “Probably true treasures being born.”

I’ve been in Universe Boat for almost 1,000 years, thought Luo Feng. I only got Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor by killing Five Chaos Master. As for the true treasures naturally born, the most precious one is the top-tier domain type true treasure Snow Fire Sector. I haven’t seen one pinnacle palace type true treasure. It’s time for me to find a better true treasure.

True treasures born in the inner area were all great. The best naturally born true treasure he had seen was a top-tier domain type true treasure, which was nothing in the inner area. In places like Flame Ice Region, top-tier domain type true treasures couldn’t even survive.

“I’ll go and see.”

Sou!

Luo Feng followed his sensation.

******

Flame Ice Region was vast, and teleportation was only possible at the periphery. Luo Feng could only fly.

After around a month…

“Um?”

Luo Feng frowned. He kept using his domain true treasure Snow Fire Sector, yet he touched another domain outside. It was a freezing domain.

“Are you Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng?” A godly power transmitted the voice inside the domain.

“Yes, I am. Who are you?” Luo Feng couldn’t tell by his voice alone.

“I am Deer Bug!” The godly power kept transmitting the voice.

“Deer Bug Master! How lucky I am to meet you here, Luo Feng replied.

He couldn’t tell by sensing the domain, yet now, he knew that it was Deer Bug Master, a supreme being from Purple Moon Holy Land Universe. Deer Bug Master was an ancient being—among the top beings of the Purple Moon Holy Land Universe. He was a level-six universe master because he had a supreme true treasure! A supreme true treasure named Deer Bug Godly Armor!

Deer Bug Master loved being alone, and he loved adventure. Usually, adventurers would die quickly in Universe Ocean. However, Deer Bug Master not only had the information support from Purple Moon Holy Land Universe, but he also had his own power and his true treasure to survive.

“Did you notice that as well?” asked Deer Bug Master.

“Yes.” Luo Feng nodded. “I’m heading there.”

“Let’s go together, shall we?” said Deer Bug Master.

“Okay.”

Sou! Sou!

A beam of bloody light and a golden streak of light shot off.

After another three days…

“Huh?” Luo Feng looked at the thrilling scene in the black swamp.

A giant boat was rising from the swamp. The boat was black, and black liquid dripped from it into the black swamp. The black swamp churned, and black liquid sprayed out.

Aside from the pyramid and the bloody tower, there was another palace with a steeple was in the sky.

“Is it Shadow and Sorcerer?”

Shadow and Sorcerer?

Luo Feng could tell immediately that it must have been Shadow Dust Master and Sorcerer Sprite Master in the palace with the steeple. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Yes, it’s me and Shadow Sorcerer—I didn’t expect Deer Bug Master to be here too,” said a clear voice. “Judging from the domain, it must be Milky Way Horde Leader.”

Luo Feng’s voice was transmitted. “It’s me.”

“I didn’t expect Milky Way Horde Leader and Deer Bug Master to be here together,” said Sorcerer Sprite Master.

“We’re heading to the same place,” said Luo Feng.

“Not happy seeing us here?” said Deer Bug Master. “Haha… I am exhilarated. I have met the birth of this Boat of Mausoleum. I’m so lucky!”

“Humph!”

Luo Feng couldn’t have cared less about the others. He was looking at the giant boat rising from the endless swamp, which seemed to be longer than ten billion kilometers. Luo Feng couldn’t tell what it was. He thought it was at least a pinnacle domain type true treasure.

Luo Feng was shocked. “It’s Boat of Mausoleum!”

There wasn’t much information about Boat of Mausoleum in the human race. The Mausoleum was a legendary place.

Based on the records, it was the resting place of countless dead great beings. Even though some great beings had gone in before, they didn’t see any bodies. At the same time, there were lots of valuables left in the mausoleum, so lots of great beings craved to going in. However, the younger couldn’t just go in like that. Even universe supreme masters couldn’t get in. However, one could enter Boat of Mausoleum.

“This is the legendary Boat of Mausoleum?” Luo Feng looked at the ancient boat carefully.
