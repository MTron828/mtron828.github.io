Chapter 1161 - The External Domain of Tilted Peak Sector

1161 The External Domain of Tilted Peak Sector

Primal Chaos City Leader stood amidst the void space.

“Three universe reincarnation eras can be divided into dozens of powers, with the total almost up to 100 powers,” he said. “Close to 100 powers… yet not one of these is comparable to the two holy grounds.” He sighed. “Both of these two holy grounds are extremely powerful. Compared one-to-one, no power stands up to theirs. Of course, if we were to look at an entire universe reincarnation era and not just individual powers, even our primal universe—which seems to be the weakest reincarnation era—would be stronger than either one of the holy grounds alone. I am guessing that it would need the total powers of both holy grounds to be comparable to the power of our entire primal universe.”

But Luo Feng was genuinely shocked. The power of an entire primal universe?

There were only a couple of universe supreme beings in the primal universe! For instance, the Hong Alliance had slightly more than 30 universe masters from its top nine powers and top-tier 12 powers, but the highest power stopped at the top-tier level. Although it did not have any universe supreme beings, its universe masters were far from weak. Some other universe masters were lone wanderers, some stayed hidden, and some had gone missing. Adding all these up, the entire primal universe could be estimated to have at least 1,000 universe masters!

There were only a couple of universe supreme beings but close to 1,000 universe masters! And two holy grounds had to be combined powers to stay competitive and comparable?

“Don’t look so shocked,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Putting together both holy grounds, the total quantity of universe masters might not match up to ours in the primal universe, but they may have undergone countless cycles of reincarnation.” He sighed. “They may not best us in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality… they are top-notch! At least, they dared to step out of their comfort zone to wander and roam, and most of them can comprehend a strongest technique.”

Luo Feng sucked in a breath of cool air. A strongest technique? Those who came out were all able to comprehend the strongest techniques?

“This was the information recorded by great beings from the primal universe, the final stage of ruination of the second universe era, the first universe era, and the two holy grounds.” With a wave, Primal Chaos City Leader took out a transparent crystal ball that was dazzling with threads of golden light. In a serious tone, he said, “This is extremely classified information, and it has taken us eons to collect it; some of these materials may implicate highly confidential events. Even if the powers of our primal universe did communicate and exchange information, the highly confidential ones are always kept hidden. Once you have finished going through them, destroy it all.”

“Yes, Teacher,” Luo Feng said, nodding.

He understood. During the trip to Universe Ocean, Primal Chaos City Leader had been gradually briefing him on some of the information he needed to know first and foremost. If such a great deal of information was directly given to him while still in the primal universe, he might not have absorbed it with due vigilance. But in Universe Ocean, if one saw how the universe had undergone ruination and personally experienced the kind of shock it brought about, he would come to hold such information in high regards.

With the transparent crystal ball in his hand, Luo Feng penetrated it with his godly power. At that moment, information rushed into his mind…

Within this universe that was collapsing, there were a few godly corpses floating afar. Primal Chaos City Leader’s attention was focused on Luo Feng, who was accepting the information he had been given.

“This… this…” Luo Feng’s eyes widened as he gazed at Primal Chaos City Leader.

“Have you felt the pressure yet?” Primal Chaos City Leader laughed.

“Yes.” Luo Feng nodded repeatedly.

After learning all this confidential information, Luo Feng felt a rising sense of crisis. It was too weak! The primal universe he was from was indeed the weakest! His godly power was at a disadvantage. Being the weaker side, he relied on Miniature Universe, Shi Wu Wings, and Flame Sand Cup to enable himself to be one of the better-faring ones in the primal universe. However, if he was compared amongst those in the Universe Ocean, it was obvious that he would be at the end of the line.

Just like the two holy grounds, in terms of godly power, Luo Feng lost when it came to strength. Furthermore, all of those that formed the two holy grounds were able to comprehend their strongest technique. Meanwhile, even if Luo Feng had Miniature Universe, Shi Wu Wings, and Flame Sand Cup to boost his power, he still ranked at the bottom compared to the two holy grounds.

“Initially, I intended for you to come here only after you had become a universe master,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “You may not have the ability to win fights, but you are very competent at keeping yourself alive. If you continue to sharpen and hone your skills, it will be very helpful in helping you become a universe master.”

Luo Feng nodded.

“Let’s go.”

Shua!

Primal Chaos City Leader led the way for Luo Feng. They left this miniature universe that was on the verge of collapsing in an instant and continued on their journey.

They continuously teleported at a high frequency, at times traveling along natural wormholes.

On the sixth day after Luo Feng entered Universe Ocean, amidst the endless chaotic airflow…

“Right ahead is one of the dangerous lands,” said Primal Chaos City Leader, pointing to a point far ahead. “‘Vibrating Sand River.’ Although its danger level is much lower than the three most dangerous lands, if caught trespassing, you would still face the danger of annihilation. Even for me, I must pay extra caution when exploring that land. If we were so arrogant as to teleport anywhere we wish within the Vibrating Sand River, I’m afraid we would be in danger of being annihilated.”

Luo Feng nodded. On the Universe Ocean map given to him previously, there were many descriptions of the various dangerous lands, and Vibrating Sand River was considered an average one.

“Within Universe Ocean, we humans must know the dangerous lands,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “The total consists of more than 3,000 places, and with the passing of time, the numbers are gradually increasing.” He laughed and continued, “Universe Ocean is truly too big! Only places like the two holy grounds would know more about these dangerous lands, but they are not willing to share the information with us.”

In a blink of the eye, it was already Luo Feng’s eighth day in the Universe Ocean.

Primal Chaos City Leader brought Luo Feng on another teleportation before they finally stopped.

“Very soon, we will be able to see one of the three most dangerous lands, ‘Tilted Peak Sector.’ The other dangerous lands were nothing compared to Tilted Peak Sector.”

Luo Feng and Primal Chaos City Leader stood in the void space, side-by-side, and gazed into the distance.

Luo Feng squinted. “Wow…”

In the distance was a lofty mountain. One of the peaks had fallen off to mid-mountain level, as though some great existence with limitless power had sliced through the mountain horizontally, causing the peak to fall off midway down the mountain.

Hua! Hua! Hua!

From the peak of that slippery main mountain, enormous waterfalls cascaded down, landing midway down the mountain. The water flow spread out to fill its surroundings, submerging a small part of the fallen mountain peak. At the same time, countless small rocks rotated around that mountain peak in continuous flight.

“That is Tilted Peak Sector,” explained Primal Chaos City Leader. “It is named ‘Tilted Peak’ because the mountain’s peak fell in this tilted manner. Look at those small rocks.” He pointed to the countless rocks continuously flying in a winding manner around the mountain and said with a laugh, “We are currently 100 million light years away. They seem like small rocks from here. If you were to guess, how big do you think they are?”

Luo Feng was stunned. The Universe Ocean Map that was given to him was considered very detailed in its descriptions of Tilted Peak Sector; for instance, Tilted Peak Sector’s main mountain stood at a height of 98.02 million light years, and the fallen peak had a maximum diameter of 12.26 million light years. The external domain made up the outside area of the mountain. Its danger level was lower, but some dangerous spots in the external domain would still be enough to annihilate certain universe masters who were weaker in the ability to save themselves.

The internal domain made up the inside area of the mountain. The danger level here was very high; even the strongest universe masters might be annihilated. Meanwhile, at the core of the mountain… even universe supreme beings might be annihilated!

“The rocks…?” Luo Feng muttered under his breath. “The map did not provide any descriptions of the sizes of those rocks, whether they are big or small. But if the main mountain is tall as 98.02 million light years, then, going by proportion, we could estimate the sizes of those rocks.”

Luo Feng tried to visualize how big the rocks were by estimation.

“I suppose the size would be measured in terms of light years,” he said, again shocked by what he just learned.

Within the primal universe, a mountain as tall as 100 million light years was an impossible sight. For a single rock to take a size that had to be calculated in light years… Only Universe Ocean, where the primal universe had emerged from, could make this possible.

Primal Chaos City Leader laughed. “Let’s go. We are still very far from it; we still need to teleport for quite some time.”

A while later, Luo Feng and Primal Chaos City Leader made it to the external area of Tilted Peak Sector.

Hua! Hua!

Numerous gigantic boulders flew about at high speeds. Previously, while they had observed the scene from 100 million light years away, these had appeared to be small rocks. Now, looking at them close-up, they were so big that they were practically immeasurable, and all of them were maintaining a speed of flight that was several times the speed of light. (The ultimate speed of light in Universe Ocean was not the same as the speed of light in the primal universe).

“Look,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “That is one of the great beings from the Jiu race, one of the pinnacle races from the first universe era.”

Primal Chaos City Leader pointed to a beast in the distance. It took the look of a flying beast with gigantic wings covered with scales and a blood-red body. It was looking in their direction. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Primal Chaos City Leader!” it said.

The flying beast’s single eye flashed a look of fear, then it teleported away as soon as it could.

“The Jiu race…” said Luo Feng.

He recalled that the races that had been born two universe reincarnation eras before the final ruination would exhibit differences from the Jiu race in the current primal universe upon undergoing changes. The Jiu race had been born within the current primal universe, but the entire race had since been exterminated. However, during the first universe reincarnation era, it had actually developed into a pinnacle race!

Shua! Shua! Shua!

They teleported repeatedly, and another long moment passed. Passing by celestial rocks that were flying at a speed which was a few times faster than the speed of light, they finally landed on a celestial rock with a diameter of approximately 8.2 light years.

“The external domain of Tilted Peak Sector has countless celestial rocks, and these rocks are constantly flying at an extremely high speed,” Primal Chaos City Leader said. He stood on the surface of the celestial rock and looked around at the surrounding void space. “However, standing on this celestial rock, you will realize that… all the other rocks appear relatively static.”

Luo Feng nodded. Yes. The rocks that were near the main mountain peak were flying slowly, while the ones farthest away flew the fastest. This was how the relative distance between the countless rocks was kept at an eternal constant.

“Huge Axe Creator is currently here in Tilted Peak Sector.” Primal Chaos City Leader laughed and continued, “So, the great beings of our human race in Universe Ocean are mainly gathered here in Tilted Peak Sector.”

Understanding dawned upon Luo Feng. “No wonder Huge Axe Creator was not aware of what happened earlier in the Yuan Ao Secret Region. He was right here.”

“This celestial rock will be the temporary gathering point for our human race,” Primal Chaos City Leader explained. “Of course, universe masters of other races from the Hong Alliance will be gathering here, too. Follow me.”

He led Luo Feng away via short-distance teleportation.

Shua!

They reached another spot that was three light years away from the celestial rock. On the surface of the celestial rock, any of those indentations could easily be as deep as a million miles or even more.

Amidst this valley was a temple. Outside the temple, two figures were engaged in casual conversation. When they saw Luo Feng and Primal Chaos City Leader arriving all of a sudden, they rushed to greet him.

“Primal Chaos City Leader,” said one.

“Primal Chaos City Leader, you have arrived,” said the other. “Have you brought Luo Feng?”

The moment Luo Feng landed within the valley, he could sense a total of five universe masters inside and outside the temple. They were all universe masters whom Luo Feng had seen before via the virtual universe, and they exuded auras that were the same as the simulated ones in the virtual universe, which was why he was able to determine their identities clearly. Out of these five universe masters, three were from the human race, and two were members of the Hong Alliance and were from non-human races.

“Primal Chaos City Leader.”

“Primal Chaos City Leader.”

Three figures stepped out from the palace to welcome them, clearly appearing because Primal Chaos City Leader was a figure of an extremely high position.

“Milky Way Horde Leader, welcome to Tilted Peak Sector.”

Friendly laughter resounded. This was someone Luo Feng was familiar with: Remote Lord Master.
