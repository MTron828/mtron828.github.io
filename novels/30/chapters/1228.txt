Chapter 1230: Clenching One’s Teeth

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was Huang Ke Master who came forward. He was from Eastern Emperor Holy Land. He had multiple bodies, and others had discovered that his comprehension abilities were inferior, so he would have loved to come forward and make some contributions to the race.

“Seventh True Master, that Ice Cliff Fortress…” Huang Ke Master stood aside and waited for Seventh True Master to take the supreme true treasure out.

All the other universe masters were looking at him.

“Haha, do you really think I’m foolish enough to just give it out like that?” Seventh True Master glanced at Huang Ke Master and smirked. “After all, it’s a supreme true treasure. If you take it and refuse to return it in the future, what can I do? I have a suggestion… You give us a supreme true treasure or some pinnacle true treasures. After we finish dealing with that human Milky Way, we’ll give each other’s true treasures back.”

“Humph! What if that supreme true treasure is taken by Duan Dong River?” Huang Ke Master said coldly.

Seventh True Master shook his head and transmitted his voice. “Those pinnacle true treasures are useless to me. A supreme true treasure at risk of being taken by Duan Dong River is worth all those pinnacle true treasures. Besides, we might be killed because of this inheritance—especially us universe supreme masters. We don’t have multiple bodies, so if we’re killed, we’ll be dead forever. Do you really think I’ll take it?” He sneered. “This Ice Cliff Fortress of mine is very valuable. It’s up to you. I’ll ask for supreme true treasures directly if you’re not sincere.”

There were over ten universe masters from Eastern Emperor Holy Land, and they were all elites within Eastern Emperor Holy Land. Two of them had supreme true treasures! As for the universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land, two of them had supreme true treasures as well. Seventh True Master might lose a supreme true treasure, so Eastern Emperor Holy Land didn’t want to risk it.

The Divine Eye Clan and Eastern Emperor Holy Land made the deal immediately.

“Okay, let’s do it!”

“We agree.”

The Divine Eye Clan selected eight top-tier pinnacle true treasures, three of which could rival Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor.

“This is Ice Cliff Fortress,” Seventh True Master said.

He waved his hands. An iceberg appeared in the sky, and there was an exquisite fortress beside the iceberg. The transparent, breathtaking iceberg could have been qualified as a piece of art.

Huang Ke Master’s eyes were gleaming. He tried to make the true treasure recognize him as its master

Star Tower was still standing in the hallway.

Inside the control room, Luo Feng observed the outside carefully. However, the great beings outside were all using their godly power to transmit their voices, so he couldn’t discern their plan. When he saw them all take out true treasures—especially when he saw Seventh True Master take out Ice Cliff Fortress—Luo Feng immediately realized their plan.

“Ice Cliff Fortress? The famous supreme true treasure that belongs to Seventh True Master?” Luo Feng felt intimidated. “It seems they want to use a sealing palace type true treasure to take my Star Tower.”

Supreme true treasures versus supreme true treasures; it was difficult to speculate which one was more powerful.

Star Tower is extremely powerful, thought Luo Feng. Nobody in the original universe was able to take it. However, that’s only in the original universe… Star Tower hasn’t competed with Ice Cliff Fortress yet. If he takes it from me, I’m doomed. If he can’t take it from me, I’ll be okay, but Star Tower will be exposed! Because if even Ice Cliff Fortress can’t take it, they’ll all know that this bloody tower is a supreme true treasure.

Thoughts flooded Luo Feng’s mind. “What should I do? What should I do?”

Luo Feng frowned and kept contemplating. Either case was bad for him. He gazed outside and thought hard about it.

“Hmm…” Luo Feng noticed the crystal and stone pillars. His eyes gleamed. “Okay, I’ll try that.”

******

Just when Huang Ke Master was trying to make Ice Cliff Fortress recognize him as its master, the bloody tower flew over above a crystal pillar while the base of the tower sunk. It immediately became much taller, and it hit the top of the hallway. The crystal pillar was inlaid into the base.

“Haha! Do you really think that’s going to help?” Huang Ke Master laughed with Ice Cliff Fortress in his hand.

He threw Ice Cliff Fortress and used his godly power to drive it. Suddenly, Ice Cliff Fortress started to float and turned to face the bloody tower.

Hong!

Ice Cliff Fortress immediately had an incredible absorbing power on Star Tower and made the bloody tower shake. It seemed to work, but it didn’t.

“How is it possible?” Huang Ke Master was horrified and furious. He glanced at Seventh True Master.

“Impossible. Unless it’s a supreme true treasure.”

“No.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

A man from the Divine Eye Clan frowned and said, “It’s not a supreme true treasure! Rather, that human Milky Way just moved his true treasure and merged it with the crystal pillar. That crystal pillar was left by Duan Dong River. It’s connected to Boat of Mausoleum. If we want to seal that human, we will have to break that crystal pillar.”

“Ah!”

“This has never happened.”

“How is it possible?”

Everyone was dazed.

******

Luo Feng sat in the control room, smiling.

Star Tower was a sealing type true treasure, which was why the base could be cracked and had the power to absorb everything. With the help of Blood Cloud Pearl, its shape could be altered. At this moment, the base of Star Tower was stuck tightly to the crystal pillar. Even if Star Tower wasn’t a supreme true treasure, it would have to be separated from the crystal pillar before it could be taken away.

If the base of Star Tower or the crystal pillar was broken, they could be taken altogether. However, apparently, the stone pillars and crystal pillars left by Duan Dong River were invincible.

“This rarely happens,” Luo Feng whispered. “When other great beings are being absorbed, their only choices are to use their burning godly power to resist or to hide in their palaces. There are rarely objects that can’t be moved by supreme true treasures—even in the three Lands of Extremis.”

In the three Lands of Extremis, there were many environments—lava, winds, and lakes—and there were no objects available to be used to protect oneself. It was like an ordinary person holding a tree during a tornado; when the tree broke or the human let go, he would be blown away.

Some supreme beings were so powerful they didn’t have anything to hold on to! Even in the three Lands of Extremis, there were a few objects that even universe supreme masters couldn’t break. Boat of Mausoleum and black-striped stone pillars were exceptions.

As for the natural objects in Tilted Peak Sector and Flowing Countless Mountain, they could be easily broken. Which was why there were few objects that could be clung to by great beings.

However, Luo Feng was in Boat of Mausoleum, where even the ordinary ground could resist the attacks from universe supreme masters! As for the stone pillars and crystal pillars, those were used for inheritance, so they were unbreakable.

Boat of Mausoleum was an exception, and great beings just tried to use a seal palace type true treasure to absorb Luo Feng, so they immediately understood the mysteries behind this.

“Damn it.”

“What a lucky guy.”

“Even though supreme true treasures are powerful, they can’t just break that crystal pillars, not to mention crack a pinnacle true treasure. We can’t do anything now.”

“Ah, that crystal pillar the human Milky Way clung to is the crystal pillar he’s using himself! Even if he stays there forever, he can still study the Rhinoceros Emperor Game!”

All the great beings had already figured out the mysteries. They were all furious, yet they couldn’t do anything about it.

“Ah!”

“We can’t just kill him.”

“Huang Ke Master, give Ice Cliff Fortress back to me,” said Seventh True Master.

Huang Ke Master was hesitant at first. He made eye contact with other great beings, and he gave back the true treasures anyway.

The three powers were all upset.

“We can only use the simplest way now.”

“Attack it!”

“Material attack, soul attack! It’s only a pinnacle palace type true treasure. It might defend itself against material attacks well, but it’ll be less efficient against soul attacks. I don’t think he can still study Rhinoceros Emperor Game when his soul is affected! We can even kill his soul!”

“Okay.”

“Let’s attack him together.”

The seven universe masters started to attack Luo Feng again. However, Luo Feng was sitting in Star Tower and not being affected by the attacks.

“Ah!”

“Soul attacks can’t penetrate it even a little bit. His palace type true treasure is very special. It must be made of some special material. Godly power can’t penetrate it at all.”

The seven universe masters immediately figured it out. Some materials could indeed block godly power—such as Force Armor, which could weaken all sorts of soul attacks to 1/10th. Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor could weaken soul attacks to 1/100th. As for Boat of Mausoleum, it could completely block a soul attack.

Star Tower was a supreme true treasure. If it was put inside someone’s body, it could guard the soul. Outside, it could easily resist all sorts of soul attacks. As for material attacks, some shockwaves passed inside, as no supreme true treasures could perfectly block shockwaves. However, with the protection of a supreme true treasure, material attacks couldn’t break valuables.

“That true treasure can completely block soul attacks!”

“What a true treasure. Second only to a supreme true treasure!”

“Damn it!”

“Then we’ll use material attacks!”

“It’s only a top-tier pinnacle true treasure. Under the shockwaves, he won’t be able to study the game.”

The seven universe masters could only hit that Star Tower again and again, like a blacksmith hitting the iron repeatedly, making Star Tower shake.

Of course, the shaking was fake; those attacks were nothing to Star Tower.
