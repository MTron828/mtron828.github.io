Chapter 1347: East Army

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The World of Jin was enormous. The 800 warriors from the Dry Wilderness Tribe, including Luo Feng, sometimes teleported and sometimes flew fast, led by true god “Northern Rock.” They met lots of dangers while traveling, and they surprised lots of warriors who hadn’t journeyed in the World of Jin for a long time.

“I heard that Nine Smoke Marsh is occupied by the strange beasts of three true gods of void space,” Northern Wind looked down and exclaimed. “And they lead many strange beasts. Even warriors from the east army will come to wage wars on Nine Smoke Marsh. No wonder! It’s Nine Smoke Marsh!”

Luo Feng looked down as well. It was a vast marsh, and clouds and mist were flowing up in the air. Sometimes, strange beasts appeared in the mist, and there were a great many true gods. It was a power ten times stronger than Dry Wilderness Tribe.

“Three true gods of void space!” Luo Feng exclaimed.

It could be said that there were two kinds of powers in World of Jin: tribes and strange beasts. They all submitted to the armies! Armies were superior, but sometimes, to train the warriors, they would send ordinary warriors to fight those strange beasts and tribes. However, those fights were all just practice, so true gods of void space didn’t need to meddle.

They kept moving forward. Even Luo Feng was amazed at how many powerful creatures there were in the World of Jin.

There are around 1,000 true gods in Dry Wilderness Tribe. As for Nine Smoke Marsh, there are 10,000 true gods, Luo Feng thought. There are countless tribes and strange beasts in the World of Jin. How many great beings are there in the army?

Northern Rock True God led the warriors, and they were in supreme true treasure ship, so they didn’t encounter any dangers during the trip. However, they witnessed many.

After around three months, Northern Rock True God looked to the sky in the distance and yelled, “We’re arriving at the East Army camp.”

“East Army camp?”

The warriors all followed, including Luo Feng. They could see that the sky in the distance had forces permeating from it. With the ship moving forward quickly, it became much clearer. They could see the endless army camp.

“It’s the East Army camp!”

Luo Feng was elated. He knew that there were four armies in the military: east, south, west, and north. Though they were all loyal to His Majesty the Godly King. And they were also competitors against each other.

“It’s enormous!” the warriors from Dry Wilderness Camp all exclaimed.

It was amazing. In the boundless camp, soldiers were everywhere, standing close to each other. The most common ones were universe masters. Other than soldiers, there were also strange beasts who had joined the army. There were many varieties of strange beasts, which dazed all the warriors, including Luo Feng.

“What’s that?”

“What…?”

“It’s so tall!”

The warriors all noticed those strange objects that were standing. Each was over 100 million kilometers tall. Compared to them, the warriors looked tiny.

“Huh?” Luo Feng also looked at them. They were strange objects over 100 million kilometers tall, and they looked like giant, oval-shaped fortresses. There were tens of thousands of oval-shaped fortresses. Other than those, there were also quite a few strange objects that looked like flying beasts.

“Those are machines!” Northern Rock True God exclaimed. “Those are machines built by machine soldiers.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Machines?”

“Machines that can be used by a large group of warriors?”

“Machines that can easily kill true gods of void space?”

The tribe warriors were all excited, and so was Luo Feng. Of course, he knew about machine-type valuables. He had heard about them from the inheritance from Duan Dong River, but he only knew about them. He only saw a few, yet those in the distance were all machine-type valuables.

“Can kill true gods of void space,” confirmed Northern Rock True God with a nod. “That’s right. Look at that oval-shaped machine. It’s called ‘Jin Luo Sky and Land.’ It requires at least one million true gods to fully control it, and it can hold ten million true gods… If it’s used, it can kill a group of true gods of void space.”

Luo Feng was amazed. Ten million true gods? It was a top-tier machine even judging by the standards of the ancient civilization.

“The best machine the World of Jin has made is Jin Luo Sky and Land,” said Northern Rock True God proudly. “The material is very simple, yet the power can reach the apex. Besides, it can be mass produced. The East Army alone has made many versions of Jin Luo Sky and Land. Even the warriors from all the armies need to use them. It’s still more than adequate. There are too many of Jin Luo Sky and Land. They are for His Majesty the Godly King, and they’re meant to be used for fighting outside. However, His Majesty the Godly King hasn’t summoned warriors for a long time.”

Luo Feng nodded.

Jin Luo Sky and Land was used for fighting outside. The fights inside World of Jin wouldn’t involve machines like that.

“See those small machines like flying beasts around Jin Luo Sky and Land? That’s ‘Jiu Xiu.’ It is also one of the best machines the World of Jin has ever made.” Northern Rock True God kept introducing the machines. “Jiu Xiu needs at least 100 true gods to be driven, and it can hold at least 1,000 true gods. It is known for being fast and flexible! It’s also great at defense. Even though it only has one fighting technique, it’s a very useful machine in a large-scale war.”

Luo Feng nodded. Not all types of machines were suitable for large-scale wars. There were many great beings in the ancient civilization, and the large-scale wars between major powers could be horrifying. Some machines might be destroyed as soon as they entered the war zone. Machines were useful for the weak, but for ancestral teachers and godly kings, they were much less so.

To true gods and true gods of void space, machines were of great use! Great machines that were fit for wars could be mass-produced and some materials were indeed complicated.

His Majesty the Godly King might have died already, Luo Feng thought. Without the summons from His Majesty the Godly King, the army in the World of Jin can only keep making machines based on the previous order. They have to keep preparing and waiting for a summons, yet they might never be summoned. Those machines might be a waste.

Luo Feng shook his head. He didn’t want those machines. After all, they required too many great beings to be used. Jin Luo Sky and Land needed at least a million true gods! How was that possible in Universe Ocean? Even Jiu Xiu required at least 100 true gods, which was still over the capacity of Universe Ocean.

“The ancient civilization is indeed extraordinary.” Luo Feng sighed.

He wasn’t surprised that it was this powerful. The existence of Universe Boat had implied the supreme power of the ancient civilization. If Universe Boat utilized its full power, even 100 million true gods were nothing.

Unfortunately, Universe Boat is broken and has to stay there forever. The human shape, which might be His Majesty the Godly King, may be lying there eternally as well. The inheritors of Duan Dong River have all died, and I’m the only one left…

Luo Feng shook his head. It was cruel. He could still sense the influences of the ancient civilization in the World of Jin.

The East Army camp was enormous. A quarter of the tribes and strange beasts in the World of Jin joined the East Army, so there were warriors joining every day. The process was strenuous, which was why the warriors who came here for assessment formed a long line; there seemed to be no end.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

The spaceship landed on a plain. It could be said that two true treasure palaces landed in the distance as well. Apparently, they were carrying warriors as well.

“Quick! Come out! Hurry! Come out!” Northern Rock True God yelled.

All 800 warriors from Dry Wilderness Tribe and Luo Feng exited the palace. They came to the plain.

“Go and line up there,” yelled Northern Rock True God. “Wait for the elimination. Do not fail to join the army.”

Northern Rock True God was very familiar with the process, so everything went smoothly. The 800 warriors, including Luo Feng, immediately stood at the back of the long line and started to wait for their turn.

“Gosh, how long are we going to wait?” Northern Wind asked.

Luo Feng also looked to the front. There were so many creatures, and other than humanoid creatures, there were also lots of strange beasts in the line. Apparently, it was not only those from the tribes who were joining the army.

“There seem to be 800,000 waiting in line,” said Northern Rock True God, glancing around. “It should take around half a month before it’s your turn. Just wait here. There’s no need to rush. Prepare for everything that’s about to happen. Even the initial screening kills two-thirds of the candidates, and only one-third of them can successfully join the army.”

Luo Feng was astounded. Two-thirds died during the initial screening?

“Do not bring shame upon Dry Wilderness Tribe!” yelled Northern Rock True God. He then left and flew to talk to other true gods from other tribes. “Haha! Zan Xu Tribe, your warriors have also arrived. They seem fine.”

The true gods were talking with each other. Northern Rock True God didn’t rush to leave. He would wait, as he needed to see how many from Dry Wilderness Tribe would be able to join the army.

******

Time flew by.

The warriors from all the tribes and the strange beasts from all the lands were being screened. Roaring, yelling, and bellowing sounds were transmitted from the front of the line. Apparently, the screening process was ruthless.

Luo Feng was moving forward with the line. After half a month, it was his turn, along with the warriors from Dry Wilderness Tribe.

“Next round, 3,000,” roared a strange beast with a bloody horn. “Come in, all of you.”

3,000 warriors, including Luo Feng and those from Dry Wilderness Tribe, were led in. They were about to start being screened for the army.
