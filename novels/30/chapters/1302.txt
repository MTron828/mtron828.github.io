Chapter 1305: Perilous Situation

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Okay.”

“We’ll follow this plan.”

The universe masters from the Freedom Alliance all agreed to the plan. They had talked about it before, and this plan was based on the common interests of all the universe masters in the Freedom Alliance! Certainly, they wouldn’t object to it. After all, an alliance formed upon common interests was the most stable.

In a beautiful palace on an independent dimension of the virtual universe, Luo Feng, Primal Chaos City Leader, Darkness Master, and Peng Gong Master were looking at the six universe masters sitting opposite to them, waiting for an answer.

“The universe masters from our alliance,” said an eight-armed man who was wearing silver armor with a pair of silver horns. His eyes gleamed with golden light. “They’ll be represented by us.”

“Huh?” The four human representatives were shocked.

Shi Hua Island Leader, who was one of the six representatives, was dazed. He turned around and looked at the leaders from other divisions.

“That’s right.”

“Yes, Lightwalker Master will represent us.”

“Agreed.”

Shi Hua Island Leader was upset. His original body immediately transmitted his voice to ask the universe masters from his division. Actually, he noticed that the 400-some universe masters were transmitting their voices with each other using their godly power, as he could sense their blurry godly power. However, those universe masters didn’t transmit their voices to him, and besides, transmitting voices using godly power was fast, so they reached a consensus in a few seconds.

Although he was confused, he didn’t raise any more questions. Yet Lightwalker Master told the humans that he would be in charge.

“Brother Shi Hua, we all agree that Lightwalker Master will represent us.”

“Island Leader.”

“Don’t blame us, Shi Hua. It has everything to do with our interests. We’ll explain everything to you after the negotiation.”

Shi Hua Master was deeply upset after hearing what his universe masters said. However, he couldn’t do anything about it. After all, those universe masters were the reason for his position in the Freedom Alliance, and they were closest to him. He couldn’t be tyrannical to universe masters; instead, he had to treat them as brothers.

******

The four human universe masters looked at each other and noticed that the other five leaders, including Shi Hua Island Leader, didn’t object. It seemed that the Freedom Alliance was indeed represented by Lightwalker Master.

“Lightwalker Master?” Primal Chaos City Leader smiled. “Please.”

“We’ve already read the inheritance information you gave us.” Lightwalker Master glanced with his golden eyes, and his voice sounded cold. “Unfortunately, we’re not satisfied.”

“Huh?” Primal Chaos City Leader, Luo Feng, Darkness Master, and Peng Gong Master were all shocked.

Not satisfied?

Luo Feng frowned. This was the information he himself had summarized, and it was definitely tempting to all the powers from all three universe eras. How could they not be satisfied?

“What do you mean, Lightwalker Master?” Primal Chaos City Leader asked, frowning.

“The inheritance information you gave us is not worth the risk.” Lightwalker Master’s golden eyes were cold. “If you want my alliance to help you, be more sincere. Give us more information, more comprehensive information.”

“More comprehensive?” The four human great beings gave made eye contact with each other and started to converse secretly.

Darkness Master transmitted his voice: “The Freedom Alliance is indeed greedy. They’re certain that we need their help, so they are more demanding.”

“That’s right,” said Peng Gong, transmitting his voice. “There will be no end to their greed. If we give them more detailed inheritance information, they’ll think we have more, and they’ll keep asking for more.”

“Luo Feng,” said Primal Chaos City Leader transmitted his voice. “Do you think we’ve given them enough information?”

“Yes,” said Luo Feng.

“Even if we give them more, they’ll ask us for more,” said Darkness, and Peng Gong agreed as well.

******

The humans looked at the six leaders from Freedom Alliance. Primal Chaos City Leader said, “This is the most detailed information we humans can give to you. If you want more detailed information, sorry. We don’t have that. If your alliance wants to help us, we’ll give you the other half of the inheritance after the war.”

Lightwalker Master frowned. “Are you sure you don’t have more?”

“No more.” Primal Chaos City Leader shook his head.

Luo Feng looked at them, frowning. It was indeed disappointing that the Freedom Alliance would try to exploit them at such a crucial moment.

“If that’s the case!” Lightwalker Master turned his head and looked at the other leaders, who nodded.

Hu!

Lightwalker Master stood up, followed by the other four leaders and Shi Hua Island Leader.

“The information you gave us is too simple for us to risk it for you. Sorry!” Lightwalker Master stood up and said coldly, “Let’s go.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Hua! Hua! Hua!

They all disappeared and left the virtual universe, including the other universe masters from the Freedom Alliance outside the palace, who had also been listening to the negotiation.

“Don’t they want the remaining part of the inheritance?” Peng Gong Master stood up abruptly and looked confused.

“Why?” Darkness Master found it hard to believe.

Luo Feng and Primal Chaos City Leader stood up as well.

“Something happened.” Primal Chaos City Leader frowned. “Why would they just leave like this? After all, they’ve only got the former part of the information, and some of the most important points are in the latter part. Don’t they want to be universe supreme masters? Why did they just give up like that?”

Darkness Master looked at Shi Hua Island Leader. “What happened, Shi Hua?”

“Shi Hua, this isn’t what we talked about,” Luo Feng added.

Shi Hua Island Leader was the only one left in the palace, and he didn’t look well. He said, “Just wait for a moment. I’ll tell you what happened later.”

******

In the supreme true treasure palace belonging to Shi Hua Island Leader. Shi Hua Island Leader looked at the universe masters present. They were all universe masters he was close to, and they were the reason he had the right to be in the Freedom Alliance.

“What happened, everyone?”

“Shi Hua,” a giant, green rock being. “We’re indeed friends, but all of us want to be powerful. When we become more powerful, we’ll have a higher status in the original universe, especially if we can become universe supreme masters and have our own miniature universes. Our races will have a place to live. Don’t blame us.”

“What exactly happened?” yelled Shi Hua Island Leader.

“This is what happened,” said a seaweed-like plant life form. His voice echoed in the surrounding space. “Both humans and the united forces alliance tried to draw us to their sides… As soon as there was a dispute among the universe masters in our alliance, Jue Hua True God from Purple Moon Holy Land contacted Lightwalker Master. Purple Moon Ancestor is willing to provide us with inheritance information from the ancient civilization on how to become universe supreme masters from universe masters… They’ll provide detailed information to us, and they said if the information the humans gave us was better, we could still help the humans. Otherwise, they require us to join the united forces alliance and attack the humans—especially that Luo Feng.”

“That’s what happened.”

“Lightwalker Master is the middleman between Purple Moon Holy land and us! He contacted us one by one and gave us the inheritance information. We’ve already got most of the inheritance information, and it’s ten times more detailed than the information the humans gave us. What the humans gave us is nothing compared to that.”

“Tell us, Shi Hua, what should we do?”

“Tell us!”

They all looked at Shi Hua Island Leader.

Shi Hua Island Master squeezed a smile out of his face—a helpless smile. “I can’t blame anyone,” he said.

Shi Hua Island Leader sighed. He had planned to get the inheritance information on how to reach the limit of a universe supreme master for himself, but he hadn’t expected Purple Moon Holy Land to meddle.

Speaking of being mysterious… The Eastern Emperor Holy Land and Purple Moon Holy Land were, indeed, mysterious, and nobody knew what kind of ancient inheritance they had received. It was natural for them to give out some of the inheritance.

“We want survival and power more than anything.”

“The inheritance information given by Purple Moon Holy Land is wonderful.”

“Plus, Purple Moon Holy Land won’t fight for territories against us in the future, yet if the humans become stronger, it will be a threat to us.”

“Besides, we’ll be at an advantage if we join the united forces alliance.”

“No matter what—the present, the future, and the benefits we receive—we made the right choice. I think you can understand, Shi Hua.”

All the universe masters looked at Shi Hua Island Leader.

Shi Hua Island Leader sighed. “Did Purple Moon Holy Land mention me?”

“We mentioned you before,” said the plant life form. “However, Purple Moon Holy Land didn’t want to give the inheritance information on how to become limit universe supreme masters, so we didn’t tell you that in case something happened.”

Shi Hua Island Leader forced another smile. “It seems you already knew about it.”

“This was one of our plans,” answered the plant life form.

“For what it’s worth, our plan is for the common interests of all the universe masters in the Freedom Alliance.”

******

In the palace of the virtual universe, Luo Feng, Peng Gong Master, Darkness Master, and Primal Chaos City Leader were still baffled.

“If they still want the inheritance information, they won’t give up,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “The Freedom Alliance was formed not only to tackle this difficult situation but also to gain enough power to reap benefits. Don’t they want to become universe supreme masters? Don’t they want to get inheritance information?”

“That’s right.”

Luo Feng and the other three were waiting; Shi Hua Island Leader sat there with his eyes closed for a long time before he opened them again.

Luo Feng and the other three were shocked. They were powerful enough to infer something from the expression on Shi Hua Island Leader’s face. He looked helpless now.

“The Freedom Alliance decided to join the united forces alliance.”

Shi Hua Island shocked them all with his first sentence. Luo Feng and the other four looked forlorn, as they knew things would now become difficult for them.

“Impossible!” yelled Luo Feng. “It’s impossible that they gave up inheritance information.”

“What if they already have information that is ten times more detailed?” Shi Hua Island Leader looked at Luo Feng.

“What?”

Luo Feng was dazed. Ten times?

In Universe Ocean, the first universe era, the second universe era, and the original universe era, none of the powers could get such detailed information except the humans. Perhaps only the two holy lands had it; there was the possibility that the holy lands had meddled in the situation. However, the two holy lands were outside the power struggle, and they didn’t have any conflicts with humans. Why would they even meddle?

“It’s Purple Moon Holy Land.” Shi Hua Island Leader sighed. “Purple Moon Holy Land gave the Freedom Alliance information in exchange for dealing with the humans. Especially you, Luo Feng.”

“Me?” Luo Feng opened his eyes wide while Primal Chaos City Leader, Darkness Master, and Peng Gong Master looked at Luo Feng.

“Purple Moon Holy Land?” Luo Feng found it hard to believe.
