When Luo Feng went to visit the blood god Baqi, a dark purple disc shaped universe ship had stopped above the huge pit in mid air.

Hua!

The cabin door opened.

The leader of the envoys, the white robed Yuke and the Fox like youth Kuyan flew out of the cabin door, followed by 8 others.

“This is Baqi’s training spot?” The fox like youth’s eyes gleamed. Gazing below at the huge pit, “The aura here is so thick, looks like there’s a whirlpool down there too.”

“Hm.” Yuke nodded indifferently, simultaneously keeping the universe ship.

“Follow me down.” Yuke ordered.

“Yes.” the group complied.

“Hehe, we’ll meet the legendary Lord Baqi in a moment.” The fox like youth was very excited.

Sou! Sou! Sou! The silhouettes rushed downwards swiftly into the depths of the blood red aura.

Within the depths, a palace was erected there. 10 silhouettes swiftly descended and landed at the entrance of the palace, led by the white robed Yuke and the fox like youth Kuyan.

“Lord Baqi. On orders from my god, we’ve delivered the blood river medal.” The white robed Yuke bowed and shouted.

“Enter.”

A thick booming voice immediately reached the 10 people’s ears. Simultaneously, a blood god guard appeared at the entrance and personally led them in. “Envoys, this way!”

With the guard leading them, the 10 of them quickly reached the 5th level of the palace.

……

Palace 5th level.

A blood red robed Baqi sat high in his throne, gazing below. Below, on the left was the fierce looking wild beast Qi Niu, and beside him were 3 blood god guards. Captain number 1, vice captain number 2 and the blood god guard awaiting his medal 97.

Yuke and Kuyan along with the others had arrived.

“Greetings Lord Baqi.” The white robed Yuke bowed, beside him the fox like youth bowed too.

“Greetings Lord Baqi.” The 8 of them behind them too knelt down on one knee.

“Yuke, it’s been rough on you.” Baqi nodded from above in the throne. His gaze then landed on the youth beside him, “You are Kuyan?”

“Yes Lord Baqi.” The youth smiled and spoke excitedly, “I was a few generations after Lord Baqi. However, I am also one of the geniuses from the undying shrine. I’ve long heard of your name and always wanted to meet you. But today, it’s finally come true.”

Baqi nodded, remaining calm.

The Undying shrine had many geniuses in one batch, the strength of the world leaders was large also. He… Baqi was a genius of a trillion years and his position was comparable to an undying. As for the other normal geniuses, naturally he didn’t bother. What’s more, even though Yuke and Kuyan below were of sector lord strength.

One was sector lord level 3 while the other was 5.

Even in terms of quantity they hadn’t reached the pinnacle. Naturally Baqi couldn’t bother too much with them.

“Blood river medal?” Baqi looked below at Yuke.

“These are the 20 medals that my god had ordered me to deliver.” Yuke flipped his hand and 20 palm sized medals floated in his hand. They were all completely dark red, and on them were engraving and words.

The 20 medals floated directly to the throne above before Blood god Baqi.

“Hm.” Blood god Baqi snorted coldly. With a wave of his hand, he kept those 20 medals.

“97!” Blood god Baqi ordered.

“Present!” Luo Feng walked out and knelt on one knee, replying loudly.

In the throne above Baqi smiled, “You’ve successfully absorbed 3 crystals, becoming a blood warrior. Today, before the envoys of the undying shrine, I personally present you this blood river medal! Train well, don’t waste your talents.”

“Your underling will not disappoint you Lord.” Luo Feng knelt on one knee, his voice strong and forceful.

“Hm.”

Blood god Baqi waved his hand and immediately 1 medal appeared and floated before Luo Feng.

Luo Feng stared at the medal. It was palm sized, and dark red in color. Its surface was covered in engravings that formed together an ancient palace. As he raised his hand to receive it, he said respectfully, “Thanks lord.” Simultaneously, he let out a sigh of relief within. He had finally acquired the medal.

Once one became a blood warrior and acquired the blood river medal, the reward would be 100k points!

“Everything is finished. I have no need to stay anymore. Once I return to the huge pit quarters, I’ll find a chance to leave.” Luo Feng thought.

“Cloud level pinnacle and he’s absorbed 3 crystals?” That fox like youth Kuyan let out a shrill voice, resounding throughout the palace. “Congratulations Lord Baqi. Congratulations, to acquiring such a genius. I believe that in 100s of thousands of years, he will definitely be a powerful warrior.”

Baqi only replied indifferently, changing the subject, “I heard you acquired a Beast god statue?”

“By mere luck.” Kuyan immediately replied.

“Your luck is not bad.” In the throne, Baqi nodded coldly.

And Luo Feng who was standing beside the two other guards was curious within. Just what was this beast god statue thing?

“Lord Baqi, please take a look.” Kuyan confidently extended one hand and suddenly, a statue appeared out of nowhere in his palm. It was about 30cm tall, half crystal like and transparent. It also had complex gold within, and it looked like a lizard like beast. However, its head seemed to be struggling with its 4 legs which were thick and powerful, and one horn that piercing towards the sky.

The entire statue emitted a heart trembling terrifying energy.

“Brutal!”

Almost like a crazed shout, the voice resounded through everybody’s ears, making everyone who was staring at the statue change their expressions.

“Good statue!” Blood god Baqi complemented and nodded.

“Beast god!” The wild beast Qi Niu stared wide eyed, and a complex look could be seen within his gaze as he looked on.

The two captains of the blood god guards too looked in shock. They had heard of the legendary beast god statue before, but have never seen it! Of all present, the only one who had probably seen a beast god statue before was probably Blood god Baqi.

……

“This, this is…” Luo Feng remained calm on the outside, inside however were filled with torrents of thoughts and emotions that took over.

Right!

Without a doubt, this beast god statue was the terrifying ancient beast he had seen in the three pictures in the whirlpool. Just the statue alone…that weak but terrifying energy it emitted, it was definitely stronger than Baqi, Qi Niu or any others! Even more powerful than some of the powerful warriors Luo Feng had seen in the primal chaos city…

Naturally, the energy from the statue was weak!

“This beast god statue?” Luo Feng carefully examined it, staring at every scale, and at its incredibly defined claws and tail.

Howl!

Brutal!

Luo Feng could almost see countless years ago, where this lizard like beast dominated the universe space. Howling and slaughtering tens of millions, its intrepid energy…completely triggered Luo Feng’s golden horned beast. What his earth body saw, the other bodies naturally saw too.

“Howl…” The golden horned beast within the internal world couldn’t help but howl out, and its dark pupils were filled with excitement and anticipation.

“This, this is the true aim of the golden horned beast.”

“This is the direction in which the beast needs to head in.” Luo Feng was extremely excited.

Having long studied the three ancient pictures, along with the golden horned beast’s reaction, it made Luo Feng burn with excitement within.

The shape of the statue was important, but the importance was given to god itself!

Luo Feng had long studied the blurry ancient pictures formed by the aura, using Tearing Sky and land technique to comprehend and learn. After rushing into the whirlpool, he was even able to more clearly study the three pictures. Those three within were 10 times clearer than those formed by the aura outside. Hence that image of the god was also 10 times clearer!

And at this time!

This beast statue before him…it made Luo Feng feel as though there was a living ancient beast right before him! Even though it was a simple statue, however the god that statue portrayed, that energy…was countless times higher than the three ancient pictures.

“Howl…” The golden horned beast howled within the internal world.

It was howling.

Almost like a cat howling, trying to imitate a tiger!

That ancient beast was a tiger and the golden horned beast was but a weak cat!

“That was not the correct way!”

“Wrong, what I studied before was wrong.”

“Tearing sky and land, compared to this ancient beast’s 1st claw pales in comparison. Looking at the statue itself, I know the right path.” Almost like a living ancient beast here, the energy emitted from the statue revealed many secrets that indeed benefitted the golden horned beast.

“I have to acquire it!”

“This ancient beast statue, I have to get it!”

“This statue, to the golden horned beast is like the 9 universe tablet to the human body. I don’t know who carved this statue, but they were actually able to capture its essence.” The golden horned beast studied it awhile and immediately realized that this was far from an ordinary statue.

Luo Feng’s gaze fell on the white robed Yuke and Kuyan’s bodies.

Those two were sector lords!

“What do I do? These two are both sector lords. I have no way to snatch.” Luo Feng panicked within. “And there’s even Baqi and Qi Niu here, who were both sector lord pinnacle. And once they leave, they will swiftly take their universe ship and go.”

As Luo Feng was panicking…

“The beast god statue, is completely jade gold, and every inch of jade gold is incomparably valuable. It’s a material used by undyings to create weapons.” Baqi looked at the statue and exclaimed a couple of times. However, he seemed more enticed by the material and the worth of the jade gold that was used to make the statue.

“However, 18 statues, in terms of craftsmanship, all are at their peaks.” Baqi’s felt his problem and quickly complemented the work.

“Lord Baqi, as the medals have been delivered, we’ll return back to the shrine.” White Robe Yuke bowed.

Kuyan too kept the medals and bowed.

“Hm.” Baqi nodded.

Yuke, Kuyan and the other 8 envoys thus left.

Luo Feng stood there, frowning.
