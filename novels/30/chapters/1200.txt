Chapter 1203: Hand over the Valuables

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng couldn’t stay calm anymore knowing that it might be Huge Axe Creator fighting outside.

“Teacher, let’s go,” said Luo Feng.

He looked around. He saw a trace of indistinct godly power flying out of his godly body, and it was condensed into a human shape. It was an avatar.

Universe knights were already able to use avatars easily. Yet it was very difficult for undying fighters to use it, as they had weak godly power. If they couldn’t separate enough godly power, they couldn’t even maintain the consciousness. If they separated 50 percent of their godly bodies, the godly bodies separated would be very weak, so it was uncommon for undying fighters to separate their godly power.

However, it was much easier for universe knights to perform it. When the original stars had first opened, lots of universe knights from the Hong Alliance left avatars.

“Okay!”

“Let’s go now.” Sitting Mountain Guest didn’t hesitate.

After only a few seconds, a towering cyan mountain started to float, and it flew to the high point. Then Sitting Mountain Guest performed that giant engraving picture, which triggered the mysterious space, and it was transported out.

Only a lake, an island, and an avatar were left in the mysterious space.

******

The cyan mountain showed up again from the ice.

Sou!

The cyan mountain immediately flew away, and it disregarded any dangers.

“Compared to other places in the abyss, the mysterious space is a fantasy land of peace,” Luo Feng complimented it. “There’s no danger, and it’s really peaceful. No wonder that supreme being lived there. The ways to get in and get out are extraordinary. I’ve seen teacher performing it, but I still can’t learn it.”

“You’ll learn it when you become a universe supreme master.” Sitting Mountain Guest looked to Luo Feng. “Oh, right—you had better put your avatar there. Don’t dissipate your avatar. I don’t have time to send you in there again.”

“I understand.” Luo Feng was smiling.

He might be able to fight some universe masters with his accomplishment on the engraving path! However, he was still too weak compared to universe supreme masters and great beings even more terrifying than universe supreme masters. Now that he had the chance to study the supreme techniques of that great being, he wouldn’t waste it.

“Just an avatar. He can just live there forever.” Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed. “I need to study it no matter what. My techniques depend on it.”

Shua! Shua! Shua!

The mountain kept getting faster and faster, and it was already 100 times faster than light speed.

“Wow.” Luo Feng noticed the speed of the mountain. “Teacher, you’re getting too fast, and it’s already over the law operation. Some universe supreme masters might notice it.”

Sitting Mountain Guest was sitting there and poured some grape wine for himself. “What else should we do? Fly there slowly? The fight will be finished before you can arrive.”

“But…”

Luo Feng had no answer. It might take them several days to get there.

Several days? The fights between great beings were very short, even for universe supreme masters. Half an hour was already a long time—unless they were pursuing one another! Chasing fights could last for tens of thousands of years, yet all-out combat often ended in no time. If they were slow, they wouldn’t be able to make it, but if they were fast, they would be discovered.

“It doesn’t matter if we’re found,” said Sitting Mountain Guest, taking the wine cup. “Come, this wine is great. It was given by a friend from the second universe era after I made a true treasure for them. Try it.”

Luo Feng laughed. He wouldn’t worry about anything if his teacher didn’t.

“The wine was created after you gave him a true treasure? I need to try it.” Luo Feng walked up.

******

Sitting Mountain sped up to 1,000 times faster than light speed, 10,000 times faster than light speed, 100,000 times faster than light speed…

Luo Feng only sipped twice.

Hong!

The trembling intimidated Luo Feng.

“We’re here.” Sitting Mountain Guest stood up. He waved his right hand, and everywhere around him turned transparent. The mountain didn’t block anything anymore.

Luo Feng looked out, and he could see the glowing outside. The wind was already gone, and the lava stopped. In front of the fight between universe supreme masters, the energies carried in Universe Boat were apparently weak. The ripples made Luo Feng tremble.

“I can only feel the vibration after arriving here, yet teacher senses it in that mysterious space.” Luo Feng now knew that how weak he was compared to universe supreme masters.

He stopped thinking. He wanted to figure out whether Huge Axe Creator was there or not.

“Yi?” Sitting Mountain Guest was surprised. “One side had the third true master and the sixth true master from Divine Eye clan, and the other side… It’s Brilliant Gold.”

“Brilliant Gold?”

Luo Feng had heard of him before. Brilliant Gold, a universe supreme master, was called “Brilliant Gold Devil God,” also known as “Brilliant Gold Devil Child.” He was a great being from one of the seven pinnacle races of the second universe era, the Dream-eclipsing clan. His life form changed under some special circumstances; he turned in the shape of a child that looked like being sculpted by gold. He had 13 arms, and he had 13 bodies! The Dream-eclipsing clan only had one universe supreme master, yet the Dream-eclipsing clan was still a pinnacle race from the second universe era with the power of Brilliant Gold Devil Child.

“It’s Brilliant Gold?” Luo Feng relieved. “Good, it’s not Huge Axe.”

He was afraid that Huge Axe might get hurt if he fought the Divine Eye clan because of him.

Luo Feng looked to them. In the distance, space and time were twisted, and countless meteors flew across the sky. At the center was a giant strange beast that looked like an octopus! It had 13 antennae, the strange beast appeared to be made of weapons. The 13 antennae annihilated everything.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

Countless meteors hit that strange beast. The 13 antennae were splashing all the meteors. There were two beams of light, both a million kilometers long, and the two beams stabbed the strange beast time and time again.

“Brilliant Gold Devil God,” Luo Feng murmured. “The third true master and the sixth true master.”

They were all renowned beings with famous true treasures.

Brilliant Gold Devil God was performing Brilliant Gold Beast, which was only second to supreme true treasures and could rival Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor! However, it was obvious that the power was much stronger under Brilliant Gold Devil God.

The third true master was named Star True Master, and he was performing endless meteors. It was a domain type supreme true treasure! It was named Star Kingdom.

The sixth true master was named Green Eye True Master, and the two green lights he used were soul type supreme true treasures! It was named Green Eye Light.

“Teacher, this Brilliant Gold Devil God isn’t using a supreme true treasure, yet he’s able to resist the third and the sixth true master,” said Luo Feng.

“No.” Sitting Mountain Guest shook his head and smiled. “First of all, Brilliant Gold only seems to be performing only Brilliant Gold Beast, yet there’s a palace type supreme true treasure in his body! Which Brilliant Gold is able to resist easily. Third true master and sixth true master didn’t use all their power either. Star True Master is only using a domain type true treasure. Sixth true master is the one doing the attacks. Besides, you should know that the third true master has two supreme true treasures.”

Luo Feng nodded.

Right. Both Brilliant Gold Devil God and the sixth true master had one supreme true treasure each! Yet the third true master had two supreme true treasures! This astounded Luo Feng. In the original universe, some universe supreme masters didn’t even have supreme true treasures. However, those universe supreme masters from the first universe era and the second universe era had a higher chance to have supreme true treasures.

“They both know that Brilliant Gold Devil God has a palace type supreme true treasure, so they know that they won’t be able to injure him no matter what they do, which is why they’re not using all their power,” Sitting Mountain Guest explained. “Brilliant Gold Devil God just doesn’t want to be hit like that, so he uses Brilliant Gold Beast to resist it… What is strange is that those two true masters know they can’t kill Brilliant Gold Devil God. Why haven’t they given up yet? They might be transmitting their voices. Let me see.”

A blurry, black light permeated from the cyan mountain, and it hit the battlefield.

“Sitting Mountain Guest! Are you trying to interfere?” said an angry voice, and Luo Feng was able to sense it under the guidance of Sitting Mountain Guest.

“Are you going to join, Sitting Mountain Guest?” said another voice.

“Sixth true master, I’m just curious,” said Sitting Mountain Guest. “Why are you attacking Brilliant Gold when you know that Brilliant Gold has a palace type supreme true treasure. Why aren’t you giving up?” Sitting Mountain laughed. “I’m not going to join, as I don’t like to fight. It’s okay for me to watch. You still haven’t answered my question.”

“Humph! This Brilliant Gold has Extermination Godly Armor and the silver wing. How can we let him go if he doesn’t hand us the valuables?”

“That’s right. We can’t kill him, but two more true masters from Divine Eye clan are on their way. Even if he has a supreme palace type true treasure, we can seal him!”

“Green Eye, Star!” said a high voice. “You guys are being preposterous! Extermination Godly Armor and the silver wing are in the abyss, and I said I have them because you guys disturbed me for blocking my way and asking me questions without any manners. However, I don’t have that Extermination Godly Armor, and neither do I have the silver wing! What else can I do to make you believe it?”

“Do you really think we’ll believe in you?” the sixth true master yelled.

“Just because I’m here, I have the true treasures?” said the high voice. “Sitting Mountain Guest is there. Perhaps he has them.”

“Do you really believe I have them?” said Sitting Mountain Guest.
