Chapter 1338: Can’t Absorb

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Swirling Water River was a second-tier dangerous place.

Someone would suffer losses in Swirling Water River even if he was in a top-tier true treasure palace if he was not reckless. How terrifying that palace was! For top-tier palace true treasures to be instantly annihilated and universe masters to be instantly killed—Swirling Water River couldn’t be that dangerous!

“I’ll go and check myself,” the First True Master sent a message to the other four true masters, then headed off to Swirling Water River.

After only three days…

“Huh?”

The First True Master stood in the chaos air and looked ahead, frowning. Water stretched everywhere in the distance, yet none of the islands in Swirling Water River could be found.

The entire Swirling Water River was destroyed? The First True Master was bewildered. He knew clearly how powerful the natural environment of Universe Ocean could be. Even all the great beings in Universe Ocean combined couldn’t destroy a dangerous place, not to mention the entire Swirling Water River.

“I feel that…” The First True Master frowned. “Swirling Water River was destroyed by an exceptional power, and it was hit directly at the front, causing the water in Swirling Water River to blast everywhere while the islands were all destroyed.”

The First true master was thrilled. “A chance! A great chance!” He was roaring on the inside. He didn’t know what had caused the scene in front of him, but he was pretty sure that it was an existence beyond his imagination, and it was a great opportunity. “We’re facing our true death. This unknown object might be the only chance for my race to transcend incarnation.”

Weng!

A giant halo suddenly appeared behind his head. There was a gigantic, single eye of flesh and blood in the halo. It glared at the endless space in front of it as if it could see through everything. In that giant, single eye was a blurry trace of light hitting Swirling Water River, making it crumble!

“It’s an existence millions of times more terrifying than Swirling Water River. Even I can’t reverse the time and space to see how it is. Even if I use both my talents and techniques, I can only locate its direction. It’s going that way!” First True Master nodded. “I’ll start chasing it!”

Sou!

He teleported and followed in that direction.

One could tell where the giant the giant object was flying to. However, it would take a long time to precisely locate. The First True Master was called “Divine Eye True Master,” so he was quite proficient at observation and inspection. He immediately revealed everything.

******

After a couple of days…

Hong!

The giant object was still flying at its original speed in Universe Ocean.

“That!”

The First True Master was thrilled. Even using all his power, he could barely “see” that the object was a prone, human-shaped creature. It was 160 million light years tall, and it was traveling 120 million times faster than light speed. Only the First True Master, by putting all his power on his divine eye, could tell.

As for Demon Beast Ancestor, who had also been following it, he wasn’t able to confirm the speed. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“First True Master! I found it first.” Demon Beast Ancestor yelled in anger.

“Hahaha! You? Do you really think you can have this chance all to yourself?” The First True Master didn’t give a damn about Demon Beast Ancestor. He had two supreme true treasures while Demon Beast Ancestor had none.

“No, I’m thinking about that. Now that we found this chance together, we’ll own this chance all by ourselves!” Demon Beast Ancestor yelled. “Don’t tell any of the other four true masters to come! If they do, I’ll spread the news and tell the entire Universe Ocean.”

“You…!” The First True Master was furious.

This was indeed a wonderful opportunity, which might help him transcend incarnation. Of course, the First True Master wanted two more true masters to come to help him, but he had to consider the threat of Demon Beast Ancestor. After all, Demon Beast Ancestor’s avatar was in the original universe, which meant he could spread the news in no time.

“Okay!” said the First True Master. “We alone will claim this opportunity.”

******

The First True Master and Demon Beast Ancestor both tried to stop the giant object. Neither of them dared to even get close to it, given its speed, and the space and time around it had already turned hollow. They could only fly after it.

The shock waves alone could injure them. And if they got closer, they might be killed.

What was worse, before they could even catch up with the object, it had already made it out of their sights.

“Stop!”

“Stop it!”

“Change its direction!”

The First True Master and Demon Beast Ancestor were like two insignificant creatures trying to stop a mountain; clearly, they couldn’t do it.

******

More than 3,000 years passed, and five more powers had already discovered the giant object. The Divine Eye clan and Demon Beast Ancestor were only two of them. However, Demon Beast Ancestor, the First True Master, and all the other five powers who joined later could only despair.

Hong!

The giant object rushed by and disappeared from the sights of those 18 great beings.

“Useless. We can’t stop it whatsoever.” The First True Master shook his head and sighed. “We’ve already tried everything, and that giant object has already destroyed three dangerous palaces, yet its speed hasn’t changed at all. Apparently, those dangerous places are nothing to it. There are only two ways to slow it down. One, it crashes into the original universe—the original universe is definitely powerful enough to suppress it and slow it down. Two, it is slowed by the three Lands of Extremis! Any of the three Lands of Extremis is certainly as powerful as this object and will likely stop it. What do you think?”

Everyone present looked at each other. They felt helpless.

They could indeed slightly change the direction of the giant object to make it hit some dangerous places, but it was pointless. If it collided with the three Lands of Extremis, all the powers in the Lands of Extremis would gather! If it hit the original universe, the powers in Universe Ocean would have no chance at all.

“We’ll make it known.”

“If it hits any of the three Lands of Extremis, the other powers will know. Besides, if we want to redirect it to one of the three Lands of Extremis, we definitely need help from others.”

“We’ll make it known.”

Everyone felt helpless. They wanted this chance all to themselves, but it was too great for them to keep it to themselves.

I won’t let it crash into the original universe, the First True Master thought. If it got into the original universe, the Divine Eye clan wouldn’t have any shred of a chance.

“We have to redirect it!” Rampaging Devil God yelled. He was the fifth power to join. “If we don’t redirect it, it might affect other miniature universes if it keeps racing toward the original universe. Although miniature universes are enormous, they might not be able to resist it as well as Swirling Water River. They’ll be crushed instantly.”

Everyone nodded. Yes. Universe Boat, Tilted Peak Sector, and Flowing Level Mountain were all indestructible. As for miniature universes, they only belonged to true gods. Although they were too large for other true gods to move, the object was already much stronger than true gods. It would be easy for it to destroy miniature universes. As long as the shock was enough, it could easily destroy the origin of a miniature universe, crushing the entire miniature universe.

If it could easily crush Swirling Water River, it could easily destroy a miniature universe, as well.

******

All the powers in Universe Ocean were thrilled!

In one of the three Lands of Extremis, in Universe Boat, Luo Feng blinked.

“Teacher,” he said. “Are you saying that a giant object was spotted in Universe Ocean, and it’s flying 20 million times faster than light speed, at a height of 60 million light years? And it’s in humanoid form? Teacher, who’s making up lies? The limit in Universe Ocean is 100 times light speed. As for universe supreme masters, a million times light speed is the limit. 20 million times faster than light speed? And it’s larger than Universe Boat—in humanoid form?”

“It’s not a lie,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “The news comes not only from one great being but many, including quite a few universe supreme masters. Leave Universe Boat as soon as possible and meet us there.”

“Okay,” said Luo Feng. “It might take me 200 years to get out of Universe Boat. I’ll come back now.”

Luo Feng finished talking with his teacher.

“What are you playing at?” Luo Feng whispered. “A giant object like Universe Boat, Flowing Level Mountain, and Tilted Peak Sector? In the shape of a human?” The very possibility set Luo Feng’s heart on fire. “I’ll go check it out myself. Go!”

Boat of Mausoleum changed direction in the endless black wind and revealed its base form. It flew toward the exit of Universe Boat at its fastest rate of speed. Still, it took him over 200 years to get out of Universe Boat.

The action team of the Hong Alliance immediately sent Luo Feng the coordinates through the virtual universe. “Come, Luo Feng! We are here.”

“I’m coming.”

The coordinates kept changing. Apparently, the strike force from the Hong Alliance was following that giant object. Actually, in the past 200 years, all the powers were rushing toward that giant object, so Luo Feng no longer had any doubts about the authenticity. Although he saw some images of a blurry, humanoid shape through the virtual universe, he wasn’t overwhelmed. He needed to see the real version with his own eyes.

Shua! Shua! Shua!

Luo Feng kept teleporting and caught up with the strike force of the Hong Alliance.

“Luo Feng.”

“Luo Feng.”

“Milky Way Horde Leader.”

“Milky Way Horde Leader.”

More than 180 universe masters from the Hong Alliance, led by Primal Chaos City Leader, had gathered here. Lots of great beings from the united forces alliance had also rushed here. They all knew what was going on and had called a truce during such a crucial moment.

“Luo Feng,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Right now, 68 universe supreme masters and more than 3,200 universe masters have gathered here. They’re all the most powerful elites from the powers of Universe Ocean and the two holy lands.”

“This many?” Luo Feng was amazed by the number. He teleported himself following the strike force from the Hong Alliance. “Wow…”

Luo Feng saw a large group of beings in the space of Universe Ocean, all sticking close to one another. The weakest of them was a universe master. It was indeed thrilling.

Luo Feng then turned around and looked into the distance. He teleported himself in the direction where the giant object was moving.

“It’s coming.”

“It’s coming.”

Though none of them could see it, they could sense the invisible shock waves spreading toward them.

Hong!

The horrifying shock waves spread out fully. Then the giant object swept by them like a streak of gleaming light. Even Luo Feng felt that like an ant beneath the weight of a mountain. As he looked at the towering, human-shaped creature, he—as well every other great being in Universe Ocean—felt like an insect.

“It’s too…!” Luo Feng opened his eyes wide, dumbfounded.
