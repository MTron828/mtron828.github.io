Chapter 1206: Bowing in Submission

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“I have always lacked a suitable supreme true treasure, always lacking one!” Huge Axe Creator stood amidst the void space, grasping his godly axe as he looked into the distance. “As I don’t have a supreme true treasure with me, I have always maintained a low profile, worried that if I stood out too much because of my outstanding ability, I would bring disaster to my human race. Teacher Origin bestowed me with great kindness and chose eternal suppression in the hope that I would lead our human race well. Third True Master, Sixth True Master, do the both of you know… what angers me the most?”

Huge Axe Creator’s eyes were ablaze as two rays of light, which seemed to materialize into blades, slashed across the length of the sky. With an angry roar, he voiced his rage. “The answer is: you wanting to destroy my human race!”

“Destroy the race! Exterminate all!” he shouted. “Just you, Divine Eye clan—so arrogant that you think you can destroy my human race? When Teacher Origin was around, did you all dare make a single utterance? Today, I shall let you all know! The consequence of trying to destroy my human race!” Huge Axe Creator’s voice bellowed. His hand was already grasping his godly axe. With a roar, he shouted, “The fifteenth!”

Third True Master and Sixth True Master were angry yet shocked. They could not be bothered with anything else. Right away, they took off, escaping for dear life.

“Leave quickly!”

“Go!”

But with one strike of his axe…

Vast darkness befell, as though there was a huge axe shadow glowing with a dazzling light within the void space. Then the shadow merged with the godly axe, and soundlessly, it slashed at Third True Master and Sixth True Master.

Hong! Hua!

Numerous stars clustered in the way were sent scattered all over the place.

“Hurry! The stars! Stop him quickly.” Sixth True Master was panicking and flustered.

Third True Master, on the other hand, shouted angrily, “His attacks can dissemble Eternal True God, which is a combination of three supreme true treasures. How can my domain type supreme true treasure alone be enough to entrap him? It will not even be enough to slow him down. Quick! We should quickly escape for now. Discussion later!”

“There is no escape for you!”

A huge axe came flying through the air at high speed. It was hot on their heels.

Its speed was continuously soaring, from 1,000 times the of light speed to 10,000 times of light speed… The rate at which its speed was soaring was extremely fast, and the shadow that was encircling the flying axe indulged itself in sweeping up everything in its way, causing the numerous stars that had become meteors upon being attacked to be smashed and scattered instantly. Such an imposing domain type true treasure was simply not strong enough to restrain Huge Axe Creator.

“Hurry, hurry, hurry!”

A palace flew toward them at high speed. It was merely a pinnacle true treasure, but what Huge Axe Creator used to carve his way forward was a supreme true treasure godly axe; when coupled with his own power, which was very strong to begin with, how much faster could his speed get?

“He is closing in on us.”

“Not good.”

Traveling at more than 10,000 times light speed, Huge Axe Creator caught up in the blink of an eye.

“Hiding inside your palace? Then I shall seal it up.”

Huge Axe Creator stretched out his right hand, which suddenly expanded to a huge palm as extensive as one million kilometers. Every finger on that huge palm had an axe-head shadow encircling it, causing the surroundings to fall into a blanket of strange darkness.

“Let’s split up!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Hiding within the palace, there is no way we can put up any resistance. Even Eternal True God cannot ward off his attacks. This pinnacle true treasure palace… Once caught, we will be stuck in here with no power to resist. Then, I fear, we will be thrown into his suppressing type palace and be subjected to his suppression.”

“Blue Eye, you are not powerful enough. Not his match! Hurry and enter my palace!”

“Coming!”

If the opponent had a suppressing type treasure and was someone much more powerful, it was simply pointless to withdraw into passive defense.

Hua! Hua!

That palace vanished into thin air.

A man showered in purple light stood amidst the void space. He wore a suit of purple armor and was looking at Huge Axe Creator. Angrily, he shouted, “Huge Axe, we have already decided to escape. Why are you still giving chase so relentlessly? If it was just Sixth True Master before you, there is indeed the risk of annihilation. But my stars… Even if they are not as powerful as yours, they are in no danger of annihilation.”

Huge Axe Creator did not beat about the bush. “Hand over the three pinnacle palace type true treasures of this level, and all enmity between your Divine Eye Clan and my human race will be put to an end! Otherwise… my axe technique will have one less competent opponent to train and hone itself against for further improvement.”

Third True Master’s terrible expression was visible even though he was wearing his purple armor, and he kept quiet for a long while.

“All right then! Divine Eye clan shall pay you due respect and give you three true treasures,” Third True Master decided. “One pinnacle domain type true treasure, one pinnacle palace type true treasure, and one pinnacle soul illusion type true treasure.”

Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!

Three streams of light flew toward Huge Axe Creator. With arms outstretched, Huge Axe Creator grabbed hold of the three true treasures and took a look before putting them away.

Sou!

Third True Master quickly transformed into light and departed at the fastest speed possible.

From afar, there was Brilliant Gold Devil God; within the cyan stone peak, there was Sitting Mountain Guest and Luo Feng, all of whom were a little startled.

The formidable Divine Eye clan always carried an imposing air of vigor. No one could have expected Huge Axe Creator to be so powerful to the extent of forcing two true masters of the formidable Divine Eye clan to bow in submission and hand over three pinnacle superior true treasures.

A child-like voice, crisp and clear, was transmitted from Brilliant Gold Devil God. “Congratulations, Huge Axe! Humans from the primal universe are indeed impressive. Teacher Origin was impressive. Huge Axe, you are also very impressive. Haha! Now, with a supreme true treasure in hand, Huge Axe, you have become so powerful.”

“Haha… Brilliant Gold, please keep this news to yourself for now,” Huge Axe Creator said from afar.

“Do not spread the news? Tsk tsk… Divine Eye clan has suffered a great loss. If news is not leaked out, I’m afraid they will not proactively spread the news. I think they can’t wait for the other groups of powers to also suffer the same loss. Huge Axe, how cunning of you. All right, I will make sure that the news does not spread from me.” Brilliant Gold Devil God laughed in his clear and crisp voice.

Huge Axe Creator turned his head in another direction and said to another faraway figure, “Sitting Mountain Guest, please do not spread this news either.”

“Of course not,” Sitting Mountain Guest transmitted his reply.

Huge Axe Creator made small nods and then his figure blurred as he transformed into a huge axe and scraped through the sky with his speedy departure.

******

Brilliant Gold Devil God bade Sitting Mountain Guest farewell and took his leave, too. Then the cyan stone peak also flew toward the exit of Deep Abyss.

Within the deep abyss, the cyan stone peak was advancing at high speed.

“Teacher.” Luo Feng was still running high on emotions, and also, he had many unresolved doubts. First, he poured Sitting Mountain Guest some wine, then asked, “Huge Axe Creator of our human race is quite impressive. So impressive that he could kill other universe supreme masters?”

“Haha… of course he can!” Sitting Mountain Guest replied from where he was seated. With his wine glass in his hand, he smiled. “Way back then, Teacher Origin dominated Universe Ocean. Throughout the three reincarnation eras and two holy land universes, no one dared provoke him. Upon seeing him from afar, the other universe supreme masters would take off right away! From how you see it, if it was just him gaining the upper hand, would it be enough to make the other universe supreme beings behave like that?”

Realization dawned upon Luo Feng. Yes, if there was nothing life-threatening, Teacher Origin would not be so fearsome as to instill such fear in the other universe supreme beings.

“Huge Axe’s power may still be a little lacking compared to Teacher Origin’s power back then, but it is already very close.” Sitting Mountain Guest sighed.

Luo Feng continued persistently asking questions. “Can Huge Axe Creator kill Third True Master?”

“No, he can’t,” Sitting Mountain Guest answered directly. “Third True Master has two supreme true treasures that he takes everywhere he goes. His ability is ranked second out of the seven true masters. Huge Axe may be able to suppress and deal Third True Master with heavy blows… but he cannot kill him! Sixth True Master, on the other hand, is weaker with only one soul attack type supreme true treasure. If he is confronted by Huge Axe, there is a possibility he might be killed.”

“Since he cannot be killed, why would Third True Master how in submission?” Luo Feng continued to ask.

“Haha…” Sitting Mountain Guest laughed out loud. “Of course he has to; Huge Axe has been hiding his true power and has yet to show an actual outburst. His normal power is already so potent that the outburst this time around will likely spark a series of outbursts as he starts to fight against other great beings. Previously, there wasn’t any other great being of such a high level to fight against him to allow him to hone and steel himself, yet he was already this powerful. Once he starts to fight against other universe supreme masters, his skills will definitely be pushed toward further improvement. He just needs to advance one more step… Then he will be another Teacher Origin! If that is the case, then now, Third True Master is right in bowing to submission earlier—so that he will not be putting himself at a disadvantage later.”

Another realization dawned upon Luo Feng.

True. He had never executed that kind of axe technique before, yet he had achieved such a high level of cultivation. Once he started actual battles to hone this skill of his, the possibility of progression to the next level was high.

“If that is the case, why did he only ask for three pinnacle superior true treasures?” Luo Feng was confused. “This is nothing to the Divine Eye clan at all.”

“Haha. How do you perceive the Divine Eye clan?” Sitting Mountain Guest shook his head. “That is a very powerful group from the first reincarnation era! Comparable to the two holy land universes! Even Third True Master was able to resist Huge Axe, albeit with much difficulty… If his opponent were First True Master, then even if Huge Axe improved his ability and power, the most he could achieve would be suppression of First True Master. Previously, when First True Master was in a confrontation with Teacher Origin, he was able to survive all of Teacher Origin’s attacks. If the seven true masters all joined forces, that would be even more terrifying.

“Humph! Furthermore, the Divine Eye Clan is nearing its doomsday. The seven true masters will surely feel an insane amount of pressure… If you really come to face a member of the Divine Eye Clan, even the power of one will be intimidating enough. How is it possible for the human race to fight and win against the Divine Eye Clan? I’m afraid other universe masters do not even dare to enter Universe Ocean anymore.

“This is a way of ending the bad blood once and for all. It is a way of gaining some benefits without making the Divine Eye Clan feel the pinch. The Divine Eye Clan does not dare to provoke Huge Axe! On the other hand, for the future of our human race, Huge Axe is unwilling to declare war on the Divine Eye Clan… That explains why we have come to this stage.”

Luo Feng nodded slightly.

True. Huge Axe of the human race was indeed impressive, but the other universe masters were weak. If there was war declared upon the human race, for their own safety, they would be highly resistant when expected to enter Universe Ocean. And if they did not dare to enter Universe Ocean to roam and seek opportunities to hone their skills, it would become very difficult for the human race to cultivate the birth of a third universe supreme master.

“Among the universe supreme masters, the difference in ability can be so vast.” Luo Feng sighed.

Sitting Mountain Guest voiced his speculation. “In fact, it is just Teacher Origin, who is a more perversely unique individual; from how I see it, Huge Axe likely received Teacher Origin’s guidance, which is why he can be so strong. Otherwise, solely based on their own ability to comprehend, it would be quite impossible for both to be so formidable.”

“Teacher Origin?” Luo Feng nodded.

Although Teacher Origin was eternally suppressed, he continued to maintain contact with the human race; however, he might be in contact with a handful of humans like Huge Axe and Primal Chaos City Leader.

The cyan stone peak entered the region that was crazily swallowing everything in the surroundings. Luo Feng had been sucked in here by that gravitational force which was so strong—even much stronger that Huge Axe’s attacks. Now that he wanted to fly out from inside, he had to move in the opposite direction of that gravitational force.

Hua! Hua!

The cyan stone peak was revolving, and it created many arcs as it moved. It gradually inched its way forward and out of the deep abyss by moving in a circular motion.

“To go out, you have to resist part of the gravitational force, but you also have to borrow part of it,” Sitting Mountain Guest instructed. “You have to tap the strength of gravity to get out. If not, even a universe supreme master would not be able to get out! This is the only way out. It will be a slow journey. I’m afraid it will take at least a few months, so within these few months, I shall help you in completing the restoration of your Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor. Thereafter, you can continue on your way. Do what you need to do.”

“Yes, Teacher,” Luo Feng replied reverently.

After leaving this place, his next destination would, of course, be the space of the black-striped stone pillars, where he could hone his willpower. Besides, he had gained Five Chaos’s black token, so it was all the more urgent that he should head there!
