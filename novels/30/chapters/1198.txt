Chapter 1200: Crazy Demon

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Luo Feng, the two true masters in Deep Abyss,” said Sitting Mountain Guest. “They are very sharp and sensitive. To avoid being discovered by them, my speed cannot exceed 100 times light speed. So, to reach to where you are, I need around five days.”

Luo Feng’s heart skipped a beat. He still had three more domains that he had yet to venture to, but Teacher seemed to be quite far from him, which would give him more than enough time to explore one more domain.

“Teacher, let’s meet somewhere else, then.” Luo Feng immediately chose another location out of the remaining three domains that was nearest to where he was as the new meeting location.

“Okay, I will still need close to six days to reach there,” Sitting Mountain Guest replied.

After that, the line of communication was cut.

Holding his token, Luo Feng was no longer worried or anxious. He was filled with excitement, and his eyes shone brightly.

“The moment Sitting Mountain Guest Teacher arrives, all dangers will dispel! The moment Teacher knew I had fallen into Deep Abyss, he rushed here right away…”

In his heart, he had always been cautious towards Sitting Mountain Guest. But this time, because Sitting Mountain Guest had rushed over so quickly, Luo Feng felt a warmth within his heart.

Six days later.

Amidst the rolling, icy cold mountain range, winding about the hard, icy surface of the mountains was Frozen Lake Fire. The crimson Star Tower had stopped within this Frozen Lake Fire, which could not be seen by the naked eye.

“In the last three domains I have searched, I have found nothing! That means I have two left.”

Luo Feng was desperate for the last two pieces of scales of the Extermination Godly Armor; he was just short of the final two pieces. Then the Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor would be complete.

“Luo Feng!” Suddenly, a piece of information was transmitted to him.

Luo Feng revealed his delight. Holding onto the token for transmission, he replied, “Teacher, I am here.”

“You can come over now,” Sitting Mountain Guest said. “I have arrived on the apex of the triangular mountain.”

“Triangular mountain?” Luo Feng understood right away.

There were many mountain peaks in the mountain range. These peaks were strange. Some resembled magic cubes; among them, there was a peak that looked like a triangle from its side profile, as though it had been slashed by a blade to become so smooth and shiny.

Sou!

The Crimson Pyramid raced out of Frozen Lake Fire and flew toward the triangular mountain. He flew over many mountain peaks, and soon, he saw the triangular peak. It was so smooth and shiny all over, to the point that it looked more like a sculpture than a mountain. Luo Feng flew over to the apex of that mountain peak without delay. At the summit, he could see scattered pieces of icy mountain rocks all over, yet there was no sign of Sitting Mountain Guest.

“Teacher, I’m here, where are you?” Luo Feng asked again.

Hua!

One of the rocks on the mountain peak started to change into a shade of dark green and began to float up and remain suspended in mid-air. Simultaneously, a cave appeared on the rock that was so tiny that only an ant might have been able to crawl through.

“Come in.”

“Yes, Teacher.”

As big as a speck of dust, Star Tower flew into the cave.

Inside the rock was a world of immeasurable beauty. It was as though the whole internal world was composed of glass. Numerous miniature worlds within it were scattered and dispersed, and upon entering, Luo Feng was immediately led into the core world. It was a vast core world where all living things grew and lived; there were countless animals and plants, as well as humans and other races.

“Teacher.” Luo Feng could see Sitting Mountain Guest standing on one of the faraway mountain peaks at first glance.

“Hmm?” Sitting Mountain Guest turned around, and his eyes were quick to focus on the black armor Luo Feng wore. He frowned upon taking a thorough look, then asked, “Is that… Extermination Godly Armor?”

Luo Feng smiled and nodded. “Yes.”

Luo Feng wore the armor in the hope of getting Teacher to realize and ask about it without him having to say anything. Otherwise, it would naturally be difficult for him to distinguish any slight change in expression or form.

“It was quite rewarding for you, to be able to obtain this Extermination Godly Armor,” Sitting Mountain Guest said. “I have heard of its great name before but never had the chance to see it. Let me have a closer look.”

“Yes.”

Luo Feng knew that Teacher was a top-tier existence extremely skilled in making true treasures. With a move of his mind, the half-completed Extermination Godly Armor flew over to where Teacher was.

From where he stood, Sitting Mountain Guest stretched out both arms to receive the Extermination Godly Armor. He looked it over meticulously and even studied the small portion of secret engravings found on the surface. The more he looked, the more furrowed his brows got. His frown deepened.

“It’s called…” Sitting Mountain Guest turned towards Luo Feng and asked, “Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor?”

“Teacher, how did you know?” Luo Feng was shocked.

This Extermination Godly Armor had always followed Five Chaos Master wherever he went and had never been passed around before. Its original name, “Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor,” would not have been known by other great beings.

Sitting Mountain Guest laughed lightly and replied, “Naturally, I have met with some unique opportunities, too, so I learned about the existence of Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor long before now. It’s just that, this is my first time looking at it so closely. That is why I only now realized that… Five Chaos Master’s Extermination Godly Armor is in fact, Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor. This is an absolute true treasure, but there is one thing you have to bear in mind.”

Luo Feng listened intently.

“By using this Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor, once you enter the Crazy Demon state, the crazier the demon you get, the higher power of this battle armor will increase, albeit gradually. However—the moment you lose your autonomous consciousness and enter an absolute Crazy Demon state, you will not be able to maintain consciousness at will. There must be another great being around to wake you up within the shortest time possible! If no great being is around to break the Crazy Demon state and wake you up… you will lose your autonomous consciousness forever.”

Luo Feng’s expression changed drastically. He replied, “Your disciple will remember this well.”

Luckily for him, Teacher was around to give him guidance.

“Hmm.” Sitting Mountain Guest gave a light hum and looked up as though his gaze could bore holes in the endless space high above. “Universe Ocean is unfathomable. Some of the knowledge I have acquired was through pure coincidence. You need not worry. When using Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor, just control your internal peace well. Do not let the Crazy Demon control you, and nothing will go wrong. Once you have attained a willpower that is comparable to a universe supreme master, then no matter how crazy it is, the Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor will never be able to cause you to lose your autonomous consciousness.” Sitting Mountain Guest looked at Luo Feng. “Also, I see that this battle armor seems to be incomplete?”

“Yes, it is.” Luo Feng nodded. “I still have some other pieces of scales with me. It is just that I am lacking the final two pieces. Therefore, quite a few other scales are unable to fuse. I am left with two domains to look into. I believe that the two pieces I am lacking should be in those two domains.”

“Where? Let me accompany you.” Sitting Mountain Guest smiled. “Being able to obtain that Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor will be a great help to you too.”

******

Without further ado, Luo Feng, together with Sitting Mountain Guest Teacher, headed toward the last two domains.

On the third day…

“I can feel it, I can feel the summoning! In that direction.”

Luo Feng pointed far off into the distance. The mountain rock that was traveling with them immediately took a turn and headed in that direction at high speed.

This mountain rock was a true treasure personally made by Sitting Mountain Guest. After he had paid an exorbitant price and put in extremely strenuous efforts. It was usually in the form of a mountain… Sitting Mountain Guest would normally sit on the peak of this mountain. Within Universe Ocean, this “Sitting Mountain Peak” was acclaimed as a supreme true treasure, but previously, during a conversation with his teacher, Luo Feng got to know that while Sitting Mountain Peak had many functions, it still had not progressed to the level of a supreme true treasure.

Just as Sitting Mountain Guest had said: “I myself am a special life-form. I am one of a kind. This true treasure that I have refined is best suited to my life… and I made it myself and have even fused strange objects within it. It is indestructible. It is not a supreme true treasure, but in my hands, it is not much different from a supreme true treasure.”

“If the treasure suits you, that would be the best,” Sitting Mountain Guest continued. “Of course, in the vast Universe Ocean, when it comes to refining and making true treasures, there is no one who can beat me. Other great beings even have to go looking for true treasures.”

Luo Feng was speechless. Who could be so capable?

Making Star Tower for his disciple, then making Sitting Mountain Peak for himself… Sitting Mountain Guest had always been someone difficult to guard against, as he was well-equipped with so many different methods and means. Until that day, within the vast Universe Ocean, there was no one who really knew Sitting Mountain Guest’s true power. It was also because Sitting Mountain Guest never really fought head-on with anyone! He always relied on various other means, forcing the other universe supreme masters to a sorry state, which was why the various groups of powers were unwilling to offend this lone, wandering supreme master, Sitting Mountain Guest.

“Over there,” Luo Feng guided. “Over in that direction.”

Hong!

The flying mountain rock broke through numerous obstacles only to end up colliding against the endless, icy land.

“There is no way in,” Sitting Mountain Guest said.

“But I can feel it just below us,” Luo Feng replied.

Sitting Mountain Guest was also frowning. Beneath them was an endless, icy layer of vast land. The ground was immeasurably thick. There was not a single crack to be found.

“I have been to Deep Abyss before,” said Sitting Mountain Guest. “This endless frozen Earth is indestructible and is completely frozen. By right, it is impossible for those two pieces of scales to make it down there.”

“But I can sense that they are just below us.” Luo Feng was confused, too.

“I have yet to hear of anyone who can break through that immeasurable layer of frozen earth.” Sitting Mountain Guest was at his wit’s end. “Let me think.”

“Teacher, let me out to take a look,” Luo Feng said.

“All right.” Sitting Mountain Guest nodded. At the moment, he could not come up with any solution. Maybe Luo Feng could get lucky.

Without further delay, Luo Feng boarded Crimson Pyramid, and Sitting Mountain Guest sat on Sitting Mountain Peak. They set off together to start their exploration of the endless, icy layer of earth.

******

In the uppermost level of Blazing Flames Lake, within the spreading Frozen Lake Fire…

Hong! Long! Long!

A huge axe tore through space at an alarming speed and charged into Frozen Lake Fire. At an extremely high rate of speed, it soared up into the sky and flew toward the highest point. When the black hole of that endless Deep Abyss appeared, Huge Axe immediately started to reduce his speed.

“We’ve reached it!”

“I rushed over here from Tilted Peak Sector. Thus, I have spent a little more time. If the universe supreme masters of the Divine Eye clan had also advanced at full speed, they would have reached it, too.”

After it slowed down, it started to suck in energy. Then it flew straight into the dark Deep Abyss.

******

In the deep region of the ninth level of Deep Abyss, there was an endless layer of frozen earth.

Crimson Pyramid and the deep green mountain rock both were flying above the endless, icy earth, exploring and searching for a way in. They had been doing so for the past two days but were completely clueless about how they could find their way in.

Luo Feng was frustrated. “Theoretically speaking, if the two pieces of scales are below, then by right, I should be able to get in.”

“Hahaha! Luo Feng, I found it. I found the way to get in!” Sitting Mountain Guest’s voice transmitted over to Luo Feng. “Come over here to where I am.”

“Found it? Right, I’m coming!” Luo Feng felt his excitement building instantaneously.

Crimson Pyramid flew into the dark green mountain rock right away.

Sitting Mountain Guest smiled and said with confidence, “The twelfth level of Deep Abyss is well-known for being barren without treasures. Not many great beings are willing to come in here. I did not expect this endless, frozen earth to be so mysterious. This endless layer of frozen earth… is unique. As far as the Universe Ocean, the three reincarnation eras, and the two holy land universes are concerned, the number of great beings who can discover the secrets of this layer of frozen earth may not even exceed three. As your teacher, if I were to say I am only second best in making and refining true treasures, no one would dare say he was the best—especially when even someone like myself had to take such a long time to discover the secret of this place. If it is you… cultivating to become a universe master here, I think you might not even be able to enter the layer of endless iced earth.”

Luo Feng could not help interrupting his teacher’s boasting session. “Teacher, Teacher, I think we should go in.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I am also very curious,” said Sitting Mountain Guest. “You can see the technique I will use!”

Hong!

The entire deep green mountain peak expanded tremendously all of a sudden and immediately fell onto the layer of frozen earth. The next moment, the whole green mountain peak radiated countless light rays. These light rays were distorted to give rise to countless secret engravings, which started to worm their way into this layer of frozen earth. At this point, the vast layer of endless, frozen earth presented a gigantic diagram of secret engravings that spread over an area of ten billion kilometers.
