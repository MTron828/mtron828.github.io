“It’s you!” Rock Wind Zhan stared wide eyed. My god! he was only acting and pretending to catch a few punks to satisfy the Pure feather family. He didn’t expect to actually catch such a terrifying character.

Rock wind Zhan’s eyes gleamed, shouting, “Pure feather Chong, you abducted him too?”

“Right, he’s already dead.” Luo Feng smiled.

“Dead?”

Rock Wind Zhan’s expression was ugly. Pure feather Chong is already dead. This man before him would most likely kill him too. What to do, now that his dantian was destroyed, he had no energy within. And on top of that, his soul was being suppressed by the enemy’s powerful pressure. He wanted to resist and communicate with others to cry for help, but he had no way at all to do so, what could he do?

Rock Wind Zhan’s expression was ugly, he was in a mess.

“What can I do for him not to kill me?” Rock wind zhan looked at the black haired youth before him. “Speak, whatever you want, I’ll do it!”

“Give me 10 blood river crystals and I won’t kill you.” Luo Feng stood there and smiled, “Can you do that?”

Rock wind Zhan couldn’t help but stare wide eyed. “10 crystals? Even my big brother cannot take out 10 crystals like that. However, I have 1 here, which I can give you. Please spare my life!” Even though his dantian was destroyed, he was still alive, since the most important part of a human was his soul.

As long as the soul was fine, the body could recover, and the lost energy could also be re-trained.

“No, 1 is not enough, it has to be 10 crystals.” Luo Feng shook his head.

“You are playing with me!” Rock Wind zhan was anxious and angry.

“Right, I’m just playing around with you!” Luo Feng said indifferently, “Go and die.”

Rock Wind Zhan immediately roared madly. “Save me!!!” His powerful body made his roar thunderous and booming. The sound waves rippled in all directions, however they were all blocked by a formless powerful spirit energy barrier. This spirit energy blocked off everything, not even a whisper could escape.

“What’s the point of struggling.” Luo Feng slapped Rock Wind Zhan’s forehead. His genetic energy pierced into his head, causing his brain to become nothing but a mess.

Rock Wind Zhan was dead!

……

“Just what is the blood river crystal like.” Luo Feng scanned through his body, and immediately found the space item. With no banks on blood river continent, all of the warriors here mostly stored large amounts of their treasures in their space items and carried them on their bodies.

This was because it was safest there.

As long as they don’t die, they wouldn’t lose their treasures.

And if they did die, the treasures wouldn’t mean anything to them!

“This space ring isn’t bad.” Luo Feng grabbed the space ring and his spirit energy immediately rushed in, prying it open and checking the contents inside.

“So wealthy.”

“He had about 10 times more than the 13 axe.” Luo Feng was still smiling initially. However the more he searched, the more he began to frown. There were large amounts of currency within, along with some valuable weapons and treasures in many boxes. However, his initial scan didn’t pick up any blood river crystal.

The appearance of the crystal was something he had seen before in the common knowledge books.

“There’s no way he doesn’t have it. What if it’s not on his body, no way.” Luo Feng searched again carefully, especially within a box of gems, there were many crystals within. Luo Feng split his spirit energy into 1,000 threads and individually inspected each of them. Immediately, a smile appeared on his face.

With a flip of his hand!

A round black crystal appeared in his palm. Looking at this crystal before him, Luo Feng shook his head, “This Rock wind zhan, he even disguised the blood river crystal and threw it in with the rest of the gems. Anyone who doesn’t search properly with spirit energy would have missed it.”

“Chi chi…” The black round crystal in his palm was attacked by needle like spirit energy. It immediately began to split open. Very quickly, the layer of black broke and it finally revealed the blood river crystal within!

Blood red!

Blood red in color, the color of life.

It was a long triangular crystal, transparent and blood red, glowing slightly, with a formless ripple about it, it gave off a faint feeling of a heart beating, ripples that beat after another.

“Blood river crystal!” Luo Feng looked at the triangular transparent crystal in his palm. He couldn’t help but exclaim, “Beautiful!”

Hu!

He waved his hand and Rock wind zhan’s body on the floor vanished, followed by the blood stains and smell of blood in the air all vanished as well.

“Very good, within a short time, no one will ever know that Rock Wind zhan is already dead.” Luo Feng smiled, “I think that they would have thought Rock wind zhan must have headed to somewhere else.” Warriors secluding themselves or disappearing for 1 or 2 years was a very normal thing. Even though he was a general, disappearing for 3 to 5 days wasn’t a thing to be suspicious of.

Sou!

Luo Feng became a blur and rushed out from the window, disappearing hundreds of km away in an instant.

The entire palace was silent.

The large amounts of soldiers, staff and guards within the general’s mansion all didn’t know that their general was already dead.

At the same time that Luo Feng had killed Rock wind Zhan and acquired the blood river crystal.

Within Swallow mound city leader’s mansion.

“Come, drink!”

“Haha, Rock wind junior. We haven’t seen each other in so long, and you’ve already become a city leader. Your seniors are really happy, drink, drink.” Within the living room, a group of beautiful women were dancing. Three men were laughing loudly and drinking their wine, one of which was Swallow mound city’s person with the most authority, city leader Rock Wind Xiong.

The other two were dressed in grey standard armor.

“Senior, I’ve only become a city leader. How can I compare to you? You’ve become a special envoy of the undying shrine. No matter where in our continent, who would dare disrespect you?” Rock Wind Zhan laughed loudly.

“It’s nothing.” The handsome middle aged man laughed.

“Senior, you and Special Envoy Mo, for what reason have you two rushed over from the undying shrine for?” Rock Wind Zhan asked curiously.

The handsome middle aged man and special envoy Mo beside glanced at each other. Envoy Mo spoke, “Brother Rock Wind, it’s not that we don’t want to tell you, it’s just the undying shrine’s rules. Hence, we cannot disobey. Actually we rushed over this time is mainly because of your master, also the leader of the world city. We cannot say anything else.”

“As it is something regarding your master, I arranged for old Mo to come along as well. Since we passed by your place, naturally we had to come pay you a visit.” The handsome middle aged man smiled.

“I’ve missed you too.” Rock Wind Zhan exclaimed, “Speaking of which…”

……

When Rock Wind Zhan was accompanying his 2 friends and chatting, he didn’t even know that his younger brother had already died.

……

300,000 km away from Swallow mound city, in the wilderness, Luo Feng sat.

“1 blood river crystal!”

Luo Feng grabbed the blood river crystal and stared at the incomparably mysterious crystal. “One of the dangerous level missions was to acquire this 1 crystal to get 10,000 points. I can use it to exchange for points or I can absorb it.”

“What should I do?”

“Without a doubt!” Luo Feng began to grin as his finger became like a blade, slicing his left palm.

Chi!

A slash wound opened and fresh blood flowed out. Luo Feng took a deep breath and placed this triangular blood river crystal within that wound. This was the absorption technique from the books he had read, and during his time in the city he had heard others discuss. Almost everyone in the entire blood river continent knew this.

Although the method was simple, doing it was hard!

”Is it going to be difficult?” Luo Feng looked at his palm.

The beautiful and glaring crystal touched and began to fuse with the wound. Especially when it first touched the wound, immediately a formless peculiar energy burst forth from the crystal. Almost like a wild beast that had been suppressed for too long raging and rushing into Luo Feng’s body. The originally confident Luo Feng’s expression changed, he began to struggle.

“Damn!” Luo Feng grit his teeth.

“Rumble!”

A formless incredibly brutal and powerful willpower descended on him, fusing with his consciousness.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

An endless stream of wild shouts to kill roared within his mind. That formless brutal and powerful willpower was clashing time and again with his own. It was purely a test of willpower. Willpower differed from each other. Consciousness was something that was linked to the strength of one’s spirit energy, willpower however was reliant completely on one’s belief and strength.

A student level’s willpower could potentially be as terrifying as that of a sector lord!

“Just this level of willpower and you want to attack me?” Within his mind Luo Feng thought, “Return to ashes!”

Rumble!

Luo Feng’s incredibly strong willpower was like a huge mountain, immediately smashing down on the roaring outside willpower influence. At the same time, Luo Feng thought curiously, “Consciousness pressure, consciousness pressure…use consciousness to attack. How can pure willpower invade my body like that? How strange? Ah, not good!”

“Rumble…” As its willpower was smashed by Luo Feng’s, the blood river crystal’s true peculiar energy was unleashed. That red crystal’s threads began to madly invade Luo Feng.

Luo Feng’s body couldn’t help but begin to shake and tremble.

Luo Feng’s facial muscles were spasming uncontrollably. The layers of skin contracted and condensed at times while splitting open and bleeding at another. His arms expanded even more violently, and his veins were more visible than ever. It looked almost like transparent crystal pathways, and occasionally purely gold, his muscles kept changing.

Pain!

Extreme pain!

“What’s going on, just what is this blood river crystal doing?” Luo Feng roared within. He could feel the temperature in his body reach unbelievable heights, almost like it was about to be burnt to ashes. However, in an instant it would drop to shocking lows. It became so cold, that he couldn’t even feel his body.

Chi chi…Luo Feng’s 10 fingernails extended, almost like metal fingernail blades! After which it swiftly retracted back and his 10 fingers began to change. Even the bones were changing within. His entire hand began to resemble claws, and fur started sprouting out around them.

Not just his fingers, even on his arms, legs, feet, and face, the black fur grew all over. At that moment, Luo Feng looked like a sasquatch. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However a few minutes later the fur quickly retracted and vanished.

Chi chi…

Black scales began to pop out from his arms, fingers, legs, feet and even his face, his entire body became huge and powerful.

“Just what is this blood river crystal? My god!” No matter how strong his imagination was, Luo Feng would never have expected anything like this to happen. And the process of absorption was still going on…
