Chapter 1233: Three Thousand Years

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

All the top great beings in Universe Ocean knew how important that powerful inheritance from the ancient civilization was! They were all looking forward to great beings from their side satisfying the requirements for solving the Rhinoceros Emperor Game.

At this moment, the life-or-death corridor inside Universe Boat in the Boat of Mausoleum in Flame Ice Region was the most important silent battlefield in Universe Ocean! The inheritance of Duan Dong River might be able to decide which power was able to transcend incarnations and become another holy land.

“Luo Feng is only at an advantage temporarily! We still have a chance!”

“That’s right. As long as we can meet the basic requirement in that certain period of time, we’ll have the chance to receive an inheritance.”

“We need to grasp the opportunity.”

“This is an opportunity of a lifetime.”

“We’ll risk our lives for it.”

******

All the powers had gone mad. They didn’t think of getting the inheritance immediately in a short period of time. It was unrealistic. Instead, they wanted to meet the basic requirements for Rhinoceros to have a chance of getting an inheritance! As long as there was a chance, there was a possibility.

Ding! Dong!

The familiar voice came in the quiet life-or-death corridor again.

“Huh?”

Everyone—including Luo Feng, who was covered by the palace giving out blurry light—looked up. They saw a figure.

“Duan Dong River!”

“Duan Dong River has shown up again.”

Everyone was excited.

Luo Feng looked at the figure, frowning. He had met the requirements already, so Duan Dong River hadn’t shown up for him.

“Blue Blood from Eastern Emperor Holy Land has met the requirements,” Duan Dong River said, looking down at a handsome man from Eastern Emperor Holy Land. There were leaves and vines around his body. He couldn’t help being excited. All the great beings looked at him.

Luo Feng also noticed the great being “Blue Blood” from Eastern Emperor Holy Land. He frowned.

Huh? He—he’s a universe knight? I’m a universe knight, and the second one who met the basic requirements is also a universe knight…

He could tell the power of this universe knight. Within Eastern Emperor Holy Land, universe masters stood in the front, followed by universe knights, while undying fighters were protected, standing at the back. Besides, Blue Blood didn’t have strong godly power. He was only a universe knight with a life gene level of 1,000 times.

“A universe knight?”

“A universe knight meets the requirements after the human Milky Way?”

“There are seven universe supreme masters and almost 200 universe masters here… That Milky Way Horde Leader is a peerless universe master, yet this universe knight is only a mediocre one. Even he succeeded?”

“How so…?”

Everyone was shocked.

Hua!

Duan Dong River pointed to the indistinct figure beside Blue Blood Knight, and the blurry palace covered Blue Blood Knight, too. The palace was golden. It was the same as the one protecting Luo Feng.

“Keep comprehending.” Duan Dong River smiled. “The more you solve the puzzles, the more beneficial it’s going to be for you. Keep comprehending and don’t worry about others… You have my techniques to protect you, so nobody can hurt you. I’ve set the rules already.” Duan Dong River glanced around the great beings present. “Everyone who satisfies the requirements will be protected by me. Anyone who dares to make attacks against them will be eliminated and killed.”

“Blue Blood, keep going,” Duan Dong Master encouraged him.

“Okay, Master Duan Dong,” said Blue Blood Knight.

Hua!

Duan Dong River disappeared.

“A universe knight is taking the lead!” Second True Master was furious. “Did he actually solve the puzzles faster than me?”

“A universe knight is taking the lead!”

Many were infuriated. On the contrary, great beings from Eastern Emperor Holy Land were all excited—especially Blue Blood Knight. He even glanced at Luo Feng. Apparently, he wanted to compete with Luo Feng.

Luo Feng took a look and thought, I’m the first one to meet the requirements. However, I’m only at an advantage by a small margin. Duan Dong River will look at lots of other aspects if he wants to find a candidate. I need to solve more puzzles. According to Duan Dong River, the more puzzles someone solves, the more likely they will get an inheritance.

So much pressure… The human race had placed their hope in him. He was already at an advantage, so he couldn’t let up.

******

Universe Ocean, Eastern Emperor Holy Land.

“Blue Blood?”

“Blue Blood met the requirements?”

“We sent a large group of universe masters, universe knights, and undying fighters… You Zan should be the one solving the puzzles fastest, as he had solved 1,200 of them, yet he still hasn’t met the requirements. Blue Blood just finished the 1,000th one, but he’s already met the requirements?”

There were hundreds of universe masters and several universe supreme masters in a hall.

Weng!

A blurry green light showed up in the sky above the palace.

“Ancestor.”

“Ancestor.”

All the great beings bowed.

The blurry light looked down and said, “It seems that Duan Dong River has different requirements for great beings of different power levels. Tell the undying fighters and universe knights from our race to work harder so that more of them can meet the requirements.”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

The green light disappeared.

The great beings looked at each other, and they were all shocked. The ancestor of Eastern Emperor Holy Land rarely showed up, however, not only did he sent a great number of great beings to Duan Dong River, he showed up in the palace, which showed how much Eastern Emperor Ancestor valued the inheritance.

Though Blue Blood Knight was only a universe knight, he was a universe-master-to-be, and his willpower was at universe-supreme master level… He can solve the puzzles very quickly. We should’ve sent more universe-master-to-be there.”

“That’s right.”

“We should’ve sent more universe-masters-to-be.”

Universe-masters-to-be were special universe knights. Eastern Emperor Holy Land had existed for an infinite amount of time; if there were ten universe masters born in every universe era, there would be more than 10,000 universe masters! Why were there only a few universe masters? Because the holy land couldn’t contain that many universe masters, just like a patch of earth could only nurture a certain number of plants. If there were too many plants, the land wouldn’t be able to withstand them all.

A miniature universe couldn’t nurture universe supreme masters. It could only birth universe masters! Also, a small universe couldn’t hold an unlimited number of universe masters… Every universe master was a huge burden to a small universe, and when it hit the limit, the number couldn’t increase. Otherwise, it would be harmful to the holy land itself.

Which was why some universe knights—who had already finished law comprehension and could become a universe master at any time—couldn’t get any godly power from the holy land universe origin!

When a universe master died, one of the universe-masters-to-be would be selected to become a universe master! They had lived for a long time; some of them had lived for more than 100 universe eras, which was why they had extremely powerful will.

******

The 800th year after Luo Feng began studying the Rhinoceros Emperor Game.

Ding! Dong!

Duan Dong River showed up again.

“Remote Snow from the second universe era has met the requirement.” Duan Dong River looked down and stared at a candidate from bug race. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“What?”

“An undying fighter?”

“Only an undying fighter?”

“Even undying fighters can meet the requirement?”

Everyone was shocked that the third one to meet the requirements was an undying fighter of the bug race from the second universe era.

“Up.” Duan Dong River pointed at Remote Snow, and suddenly, a blurry palace surrounded Remote Snow.

******

Time flew.

One candidate after another met the requirements, and soon, the powers understood that there were different levels of requirements for great beings of different power levels, as none of the seven universe supreme masters met the requirements.

The first one was Luo Feng! The second one was a universe knight! The third one was undying! The fourth one was undying!

The fifth one was a universe master: You Zan from Eastern Emperor Holy Land. And up until then, two from Eastern Emperor Holy Land had met the requirements. It’d been 1,100 years since Luo Feng had met the requirements.

The sixth one was a universe knight! The seventh one was a universe master! And he was Luo Feng’s acquaintance, Deer Bug Master.

******

Almost 3,000 years passed.

In the life-or-death corridor, one blurry palace after another covered the candidates who made the cut. 62 candidates had met the requirements. In fact, from the 2,000th year onward, many candidates met the requirements. For example, Peng Gong Master had met the requirements already. Yet none of the seven universe supreme masters had met the requirements.

Ding! Dong!

Duan Dong Master showed up again.

It was common for Duan Dong Master to show up. Everyone looked up to see which power had met the requirements.

“Tie Bu Demon Master from the first universe era has met the requirements,” said Duan Dong River.

All seven universe supreme masters in the life-or-death corridor shuddered.

“Gosh!”

“Finally, a universe supreme master has met the requirements.”

All the great beings looked to him.

It was too harsh. Finally, a universe supreme master succeeded!

Those universe supreme masters felt both excited and despondent. Nearly 3,000 years! One great being after another who was weaker than them had succeeded, yet none of the seven universe supreme masters had succeeded. They thought there was no hope for universe supreme masters.

Finally, Tie Bu Demon Master had succeeded.

63rd!

“Universe supreme masters need to solve 2,000 puzzles!” Tie Bu Demon Master had strong mixed feelings.
