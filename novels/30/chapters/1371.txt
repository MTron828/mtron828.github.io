Chapter 1374: The Strongest Warrior

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng and the other warriors—a total of ten of them from the four armies of World of Jin—looked at one another in the eyes. Then, almost simultaneously, they transformed into streaks of flowing light and headed for the towering doors. Out they flew. Not a single warrior dared to teleport recklessly. After all, the mission to receive a title was at an extremely terrifying level that all of them completely understood.

In Wu Qi Tower, the world on the first level was a vast desert where bouts of cold wind blew. It was frigid, and frost could be faintly seen forming on the grains of sands. Faraway was a lofty space portal.

Sou! Sou! Sou!

Ten figures flew in through the space portal and were surveying their surroundings. Thereafter, they gradually descended to stand on the surface of the desert.

“The first level of Wu Qi Tower?” Luo Feng looked around at his surroundings only to see a vast desert. The end was nowhere in sight. Even the faraway space portal had vanished without a trace.

The tall, skinny warrior, Xu Zhong, who was beside Luo Feng, sent a voice transmission. “This Wu Qi Tower is incomparably dangerous. Milky Way, what do you think? Where could the danger be lurking? Could it be under this endless desert?”

Luo Feng shook his head. “I have no idea.”

Ten warriors—a total of six tribal warriors and four beast warriors—all were exercising extreme caution and maintaining great vigilance.

Out of the ten warriors, only two came from the East Army: Luo Feng and Xu Zhong. The two naturally drew closer to one another, whether consciously or subconsciously, so that, in case either met with danger, they could rely on each other to deal with the situation.

Hong!

The quiet peacefulness of the desert was suddenly disrupted by a loud rumble. The impact of the energy waves spread out in all directions. In an instant, it had swept through the entire endless region.

Luo Feng and everyone else could feel the vibrating waves and turned to look. Far away in the sky above the desert, a dazzling beam of light extended downward in a contorted manner, moving fast as lightning. In a matter of seconds, a huge cyan light beam was formed, connecting the desert and the boundless sky above.

“What is that?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It seems to contain an extremely strong power.”

The warriors were all filled with doubts.

At that moment, on the upper surface of the cyan light beam that connected the desert to the sky above, many huge black characters suddenly appeared in a distorted manner. In bold black, every character exuded a formidable, murderous intent that wasted no time in penetrating and invading the minds of Luo Feng and every warrior present. It was so powerful that even Luo Feng’s willpower was stirred. Both his eyes reddened slightly, and in his heart, his roaring emotions could not seem to be tamed.

The black characters continued to appear one after another.

This is the passageway that connects the first and second levels of Wu Qi Tower.

Those who enter this passageway will be able to enter the second level of Wu Qi Tower.

You must first kill one warrior before you can enter this passageway.

If you do not kill another warrior, you will never be able to leave this place for eternity… Before those lofty doors open again for the next batch of warriors to enter, warriors who had yet to enter the second level will be annihilated.

Those who hide in battleship treasures to avoid the war shall be considered failed attempts. For them, the final verdict will also be annihilation!

The black characters were suspended in midair, radiating endless, oppressive force.

The murderous intent contained in these characters alone was enough to push every warrior to the limit of his tolerance. Such oppressive force! If it had intended to annihilate some of these warriors, who were merely law masters, one sweep through the crowd would probably have been enough to bring them to annihilation. No one would be able to pull any tricks in Wu Qi Tower; all ten warriors, including Luo Feng, harbored no doubts about its authenticity.

This was why…

“One must kill a warrior to be able to enter the passageway to enter the second level of Wu Qi Tower?” Luo Feng was shocked. “Meaning to say that out of ten warriors, at least five shall die!”

Suddenly, Luo Feng understood why the single-horned beast true god outside had said that half of all warriors from the first three batches had died.

“Kill one? But who to choose?”

Luo Feng’s eyes swept the surroundings.

As all ten warriors had entered together. They were all standing quite near to one another. Everyone was looking around with due vigilance. They were all considering who they should choose as their opponent, since every warrior who had dared to turn up for this mission would be quite extraordinary. If they happened to choose an opponent much stronger than themselves, they would end up being eliminated instead.

Hua!

Soundlessly, the surrounding space was frozen. It seemed to have been done by multiple warriors all at once.

Hong!

Following a wild and raging rumbling sound, one of the warriors made a move, causing the situation—which had previously been kept under control—to erupt instantly.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

One by one, the warriors burst into sudden action, charging toward their individual targets.

“Roar!” An ugly beast with huge scaly wings let out a howl as he charged toward Luo Feng.

“Meet your doom!” said a burly warrior holding a large, fearsome hammer. The hammer was surrounded by endless lightning, and the strength of its power immediately led Luo Feng to the conclusion that this hammer was definitely an automaton type treasure.

Hu!

A beam of black shot swept directly at Luo Feng’s head.

Three warriors were attacking Luo Feng at the same time! Unexpectedly, three warriors had chosen him!

Luo Feng could not help but laugh. It seemed that admitting to the fact that he was a new recruit, when they had all been outside Wu Qi Tower, had indeed brought him some trouble. He had heard it said, “Boldness of execution stems from superb skills,” and this was clearly what the saying meant. He had known that he had skills that would certainly allow him to dominate over these so-called elite warriors. That was why Luo Feng had purposefully dared make such a bold statement.

Sou!

Luo Feng made a speedy retreat.

Hong!

Countless snowflakes suddenly appeared in the surroundings, manifesting in a voluminous amount. This was one of the domain type true god level treasures he had traded for previously, and now, he was using it to suppress and restrain these three warriors who were attacking him.

The moment the three warriors who had deigned to sneak-attack Luo Feng were enshrouded within the domain, he could instantly make out who they were—especially that ghostly one. The first was a beast, the second was a burly warrior, and the third was, unexpectedly, someone who was also from the East Army like himself. It was none other than Xu Zhong!

“Xu Zhong!” Luo Feng sent a furious roar via voice transmission. “You and I are fellow warriors from the East Army. This is just the first level of Wu Qi Tower, and here you are, making a move on me?”

“You are a new recruit!” Xu Zhong shouted coldly. “If I don’t kill you, who else should I kill!”

Hong!

Layers of purple light surrounded Xu Zhong, resisting the countless snowflakes that Luo Feng had forcibly imposed over him. Obviously, this Xu Zhong also had a domain type treasure in his possession.

“Hahaha…!” Luo Feng laughed. He despised warriors like Xu Zhong the most. With a loud roar and a single movement, he transformed into a blurry blade figure. He easily avoided the burly warrior and made a dive for Xu Zhong.

A dodge, followed by a dive. How simple! Yet it was enough to evoke noticeable changes in the expressions of the three warriors besieging Luo Feng. This set of moves not only allowed Luo Feng to easily avoid the burly warrior, but it could even throw the beast far into the distance. A weak fighter may not have been able to notice this, but these were all elite warriors; just one glance and they could tell that this Milky Way had terrifying moves.

“Not good!” Xu Zhong let out a low growl.

Hua!

Layers of white light immediately emerged from his entire being, and, very quickly, he became a white flying beast. The white flying beast shook its pair of wings and soared up high in a straight line to make its escape into the distance.

This caused a slight change in Luo Feng’s expression. “An automaton type treasure, ‘Bib Bird’!”

Bib Bird was an automaton type treasure owned by the East Army. It was extremely skillful in escaping, though it may not have been very adept in other areas, like dodging. It was exceptionally fast when accelerating in a straight line to escape! To trade for it, one would have had to pay 600,000 military credits! It was much more expensive than Golden Claw God, which Luo Feng was using. In the category of escape, it was incomparably impressive.

All Xu Zhong needed was one glimpse at Luo Feng’s simple body movement, and he knew he had been driven up against a wall. With his close-combat technique, Luo Feng had dealt him ten blows, while he had, at most, attacked Luo Feng once. If the situation persisted, Luo Feng would soon be shoving him aside and blocking him out. Seeing that circumstances were to his disadvantage, Xu Zhong had taken out “Bib Bird” right away to immediately make his escape!

“You’re lucky you are fast enough.” Luo Feng snorted with indifference and was no longer concerned with Xu Zhong. He was clearly aware that, with an automaton type treasure like Bib Bird, Xu Zhong would be far too difficult to kill.

******

Far off in the distance, Bib Bird spread its wings wide and looked in Luo Feng’s direction.

“A new recruit? He is far more powerful than a veteran!” Xu Zhong wore an awful, pained expression. “Is he lying? That can’t be. I know every warrior from Python River Army who has impressive skills other than the new recruits. I don’t know him, so it’s likely he is not lying. He must be a new recruit. But for a mere new recruit to be so impressive… I’m in trouble. Even if I manage to pull through this first ordeal at the first level, I still have the second level, then the third level…”

Xu Zhong was now filled with regrets. What awful foresight he’d had. The single choice he had made would be his greatest misfortune. He had targeted the most powerful warrior of their batch.

******

Sou! Sou!

Xu Zhong was quick to his escape, while the other two warriors, who also saw the disadvantageous situation they were in, likewise started to make the escape without delay.

The burly warrior with the gigantic lightning hammer gave his body a shake. Unexpectedly, a pair of black wings appeared. Then he speedily flew away with a whistling sound. The beast warrior, on the other hand, was making a slow escape—or at least slow relative to the speed of Xu Zhong and the burly warrior.

“Whose fault is it that you are too slow?” Luo Feng let out a low growl and charged over with ferocity.

Hong!

As Luo Feng was giving chase, slicing through space, his entire being started to transform. In the blink of an eye, he had transformed into an incomparably large and savage humanoid beast. His hands and legs morphed into huge, golden claws.

Automaton type treasure—Golden Claw God! Set ablaze!

His godly power was instantly blazing up to the first stage! Right away, the blazing godly power penetrated Golden Claw God and traveled all the way to its core, where it underwent a change. The powerful golden claws radiated an endlessly wild and ferocious aura.

******

“No!”

The hideous beast with its scaly, armored wings looked behind it and was instantly dumbstruck. Golden Claw God was closing the distance from behind—and was moving far too fast!

“How could his speed be so fast?”

The beast with the scaly, armored wings felt very troubled. In the first place, why had he not used his military credits to trade for something that could help him escape? He had dared come here because he had an automaton type treasure, but it was one that was used for attack purposes. In terms of attack, he was not the least bit afraid of the other warriors, but seeing how Luo Feng was able to dodge attacks, he knew that he would be bound for failure if he continued battling Luo Feng. He needed to escape!

However, he was unable to escape!

Hong!

With unmatched ferocity, Luo Feng flew toward the beast at such a speed that he produced a whistling sound. High up above, he flew.

With legs like two large blades, Luo Feng sliced through the air with a loud whistle! With both legs, he executed his blade technique, Light of Water and Fire. Although he was only able to execute the first stage of Extermination, his level of secret technique was obviously higher than his opponent; while his blazing godly power was merely comparable to the other party, his dodging ability was much more impressive.

The exchange of blows with Luo Feng had made the scaly, armored beast realize that it had fallen into dire straits. “No!” bellowed the beast.

There was no escape for it at all. It had attacked Luo Feng, who had avoided the attack easily. He had tried to block off Luo Feng, which had caused his power to be greatly reduced. But when Luo Feng attacked him, the beast now realized he might not be able to block off all his attacks.

Hua!

The ferocious, sharp golden claws were like blades. Without hesitation, they slashed at the head of the scaly, armored beast, savagely sending the beast crashing toward the boundless desert.

Hua! Hua!

Luo Feng’s legs were like blades, and with increasing brute strength and cruelty, he pared the scales off the scaly, armored beast one by one.
