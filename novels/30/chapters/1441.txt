Chapter 1443: Beginning of the Origin, Arrival of Sector Beast

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Just as Luo Feng was putting his universe structure in place, within the vast Universe Ocean, Sector Beast Morosa was advancing at high speed.

“Loathsome.” The two heads of Sector Beast Morosa looked ferocious. “They all knew my power is greatly reduced… Even those fools whom I have always looked down upon previously are all charging toward me now. Now, I don’t even have a space to survive in within the Sector Beasts’ nest. If not for them, given my power, it would not be difficult at all for me to make my way back to the third stage.”

Anger. Although Morosa had madly devoured an entire Sector Beast to climb its way up to the second stage, that Sector Beast had transmitted the news about Morosa’s greatly reduced power before it was annihilated. This had reduced Sector Beast Morosa to the state of a rat scampering across the street, with everyone chasing after him, trying to attack him. When Morosa had stood at the peak, instinctively, it had wanted to kill the other Sector Beasts too; now that it was weak, it was natural for the other Sector Beasts to want to reciprocate with revenge.

“I can only return to Universe Ocean.” Sector Beast Morosa shook its head. “Since I no longer have a place in the nest, then before I meet my end, I shall let that Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng know the consequences of messing with me.”

Morosa was not fully confident that it could take revenge on Luo Feng. However… it did not have a choice!

The burning desire to destroy ran in its blood. It was the source of its courage to bring destruction upon itself by taking revenge on Luo Feng. Even if it could not kill Luo Feng, it would still attempt to draw out the repulsive feelings toward Luo Feng. And finally, it would transmit all the information it had back to the Land of Darkness and cause Luo Feng to fall into a truly massive calamity.

Sou! Sou!

Sector Beast Morosa executed a series of long-distance teleportations, and very soon, it arrived at the peripheral region of a miniature universe.

“Roar!”

The black fog reappeared in a winding manner around Morosa while streams of distorted light rays extended out directly toward the miniature universe. It did not devour but merely maintained this state.

A short while later, a ship appeared out of nowhere, and a figure flew out from within it. This figure was none other than the majestic and burly Nine-Headed Demon Master.

Nine-Headed Demon Master took one look at Sector Beast Morosa and could not help feel a pinch of regret. He was a true god that had always stayed low-key and showed forbearance to all its wrath and frustrations. After he had learned that the World of Jin had appeared, he had gradually started to reveal his power. He was, in fact, ranked as one of the eight heroes of Universe Ocean.

Even before Hong and Eye Devil God, he had already sent some of the universe masters under his command over to the Sector Beasts’ nest to explore. Every time he sent an exploration team, someone was bound to be annihilated. However, he usually sent out energy life forms, so at least there would not be souls being exterminated.

It was through these explorations that Nine-Headed Demon Master had gotten to know what a terrifying quantity of Sector Beasts were within the nests. His underlings had found out about merely a portion of them, yet that many Sector Beasts was enough to completely fill up a substantial amount of land. The number had sent shivers down his spine!

He was still filled with anticipation. Even though the Sector Beasts were not considered to be very powerful at the moment, one was enough to bring the races within all of Universe Ocean to the brink of collapse.

Finally, Nine-Headed Demon Master had secretly contacted Sector Beast Morosa, and he had decided to pledge allegiance to the Sector Beasts! Just like how Great Thunder Star Master, Dragon Rock Ancestral God, and Zhen Jia Emperor.

However, the moment Nine-Headed Demon Master changed sides, he had greatly regretted his decision. Changing sides meant becoming an obedient servant that only listened and acted according to the wishes of the Sector Beasts. Furthermore, he had a hunch that more trouble was brewing. In the future, when the king of Sector Beasts was born, those who had defected would face tragedy all the same.

He felt deep remorse, but it was too late for regrets!

“My original intention was to keep myself safe during this crisis by taking the side of the Sector Beasts,” Nine-Headed Demon Master said to himself. “I am from the second reincarnation era, and I have the inheritance of the ancient civilization from the World of Jin. With all these, it is totally possible for me to transcend reincarnation during the final period of the third reincarnation era. I never expected such an outcome for pledging allegiance to the Sector Beasts… Loathsome willpower of the origin! It should have mentioned this earlier.”

Nine-Headed Demon Master was regretful and angry. Thanks to Nine-Headed Demon Master’s role as a traitor, Sector Beast Morosa had been able to evade the area where Luo Feng had hidden in order to ambush him.

“Nine-Headed Demon Master,” Morosa said, staring.

“My great king,” Nine-Headed Demon Master responded respectfully. The moment he had changed sides, he had begun to address any Sector Beasts he met as “king”!

Morosa nodded. “Tell me. During this period, what is happening within Universe Ocean? What is Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng up to nowadays?”

Nine-Headed Demon Master replied right away, “My great king! It is relatively peaceful in Universe Ocean. It’s just that Milky Way Horde Leader has now become a true god.”

“He became a true god!” Morosa was greatly taken aback. Previously, when Luo Feng was still a universe master, he had been able to bring Morosa down from the third grade to the first grade. Morosa had only just managed to make it back to second grade, and Luo Feng was already a true god. If they were to cross paths again, the outcome was a given. Morosa would be the one being trampled upon.

“So fast!” Morosa said in shock.

“Not fast.” Nine-Headed Demon Master shook its head. “Milky Way Horde Leader is our universe’s Number One Master. Given his impressive talent, it is considered slow that it took him a trillion eras to finally break through. Besides, his disciple long go became a true god. Also, I have to inform my king… during the time when Milky Way Horde Leader broke through, he…”

Nine-Headed Demon Master related everything he knew, including the billions of races within the primal universe going down on their knees to bow to Luo Feng, and Luo Feng’s miniature universe with a diameter of 100,00 light years. Everything it knew, it related without leaving out a single detail.

The more Morosa learned, the more twisted his expression became.

“Milky Way Horde Leader’s miniature universe has just entered Universe Ocean,” Nine-Headed Demon Master informed Morosa. “At this point, he ought to be laying the structure of his miniature universe. Even if his miniature universe has finalized its form, there is still the evolution of chaos… All these steps require time to complete, and since his miniature universe is so big, I suspect the time that is required will be much longer than most true gods. He might be stuck in there for a month or two.”

Sector Beast Morosa was delighted to hear this. Stuck in there?

Joyfully, Morosa thought, True. After becoming a true god, this Luo Feng will have no other bodies. Only his original body… Then he will not be so daring as to patrol about Universe Ocean. He has to protect his miniature universe as well as his human race. However, there is also the possibility that he will risk coming out to patrol anyway. After all, with so many true gods in his Hong Alliance, if such a group were to take action together, they would still be able to stop me.

Endless thoughts went through Morosa’s mind. Then it grinned.

No matter what, at least for the coming two months… Luo Feng was not able to come out!

“Hahaha…” Morosa laughed heartily. “Nine-Headed, you did well,” he praised.

Nine-Headed Demon Master bowed his head to indicate his allegiance.

Morosa roared with laughter, then teleported away. Nine-Headed Demon Master raised his heads, but all nine of them registered awful expressions. One wrong step, and all the following steps were wrong, too. There was no longer any chance to look back and reconsider his decision.

Within Luo Feng’s miniature universe…

“100,000 Heavens!”

The entire miniature universe had 100,000 planes. They were of different sizes, and there were also differences in structure. Indistinctly, there was contact across every one of these planes within the space. Just like a whirlpool, the chaotic airflow encircled the peripheral region of the planes. 100,000 heavens were all revolving. And internally, everything was pushing toward completion.

At the same time, in the chaotic environment within the universe origin, 100,000 planets started to revolve. These 100,000 planets corresponded to 100,000 Heavens. It was as if the structure of the miniature universe was undergoing a process of “miniaturization” within the space of the origin. Yet Luo Feng knew that it was, in fact, the space of the origin guiding everything happening on the outside world.

After a while, Luo Feng’s eyes shone brightly. “100,000 Heavens is successfully completed,” he said. “Now, I must begin the most important step! Beginning of the Origin!”

Luo Feng’s willpower enshrouded his entire miniature universe. Instantly, 100,000 planes within space started to revolve violently. Every plane was indistinctly maintaining contact with one another. Such contact was unable to be detected by the naked eye. However, within the universe origin, the 100,000 planets that corresponded to 100,000 Heavens, were bursting with streams of golden light. These rays of light were connecting to form a massive network of incomparable precision, like a “super complex” in The Rhinoceros Emperor Game.

“Form!”

Luo Feng’s willpower let out a ferocious roar. 100,000 planets within the universe origin suddenly unleashed a dazzling light. The complex Rhinoceros Emperor Game that was formed by the countless golden light rays was also bursting with energy. Within the entire core, a mass of nothingness was formed.

Hong! Long! Long!

An earth-shattering sound was heard, and the 100,000 planes were still revolving. The whirlpool they created was expanded upon their continuous bombardment against one another. These planes seemed to be randomly scattered about, but once they all started to revolve, once every single plane started to rotate at the same time, it was like Earth revolving around the sun; the 100,000 planes within the surfaces also started revolving around the core!

It was too difficult. It was like pulling and grinding. The beginning pull was always the most difficult. All 100,000 planes within the surfaces surrounded the central core. And the moment they started to revolve, Luo Feng’s willpower felt as though it was about to crumble and collapse. At long last, everything seemed to be revolving. Then the speed of revolution gradually increased! Steadily, some of the planes started to collide with one another. The more delicate ones immediately started to show signs of cracks.

Peng!

One of the planes collapsed right away. Luo Feng remained expressionless. He continued to keep everything under control.

“I say, form!” Luo Feng’s willpower roared once again.

Hong!

The miniature universe let out another rumble that was so loud that it could be heard even from the outside. Luo Feng’s universe origin also let out the same rumble. Then what could be seen was the central position of almost 100,000 planes within spaces, a whirlpool that was in continuous revolution had appeared. It was like a bottomless black hole of whirlpools. Right in the center of the whirlpools was the universe origin. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At that moment, close to the center of these 100,000 planets that were within the universe origin, a void whirlpool appeared.

“Done.” Luo Feng could not conceal his delight.

Everything returned to peace and quiet. With the void whirlpool as the center, close to 100,000 planes were led into continuous revolution. While they were revolving, a new plane unexpectedly emerged. Thereafter, planes started emerging successively. In a fleeting moment, 100,000 planes were recovered. Likewise, within the universe origin, 100,000 planets were recovered.

Luo Feng’s face reflected his joy. “The ‘Beginning of the Origin’ is formed. Everything will have the origin. The birth of everything and anything on Earth is now endless and limitless.”

The void space formed by 100,000 Heavens was none other than the origin. With this origin, his miniature universe could be given endless possibilities. Even if all 100,000 planes within space were shattered, they still had the chance of rebirth.

“Beginning of the Origin…” Luo Feng looked within his own universe origin and saw 100,000 bright, dazzling planets encircling the central void as they revolved around it. This central void was the ultimate core of the entire universe origin. This origin was where everything began. Within the void space, loud gurgling sounds were soon heard. Then, like a fountain spraying water, a tremendous amount of godly ocean water gushed out. And outside Luo Feng’s miniature universe, the tremendous amount of chaotic airflow was being absorbed like mad.

Hua! Hua! Hua!

The endless chaotic airflow started to wind and revolve around Luo Feng’s miniature universe, forming a massive whirlpool. Every moment, a tremendous amount of chaotic airflow was being swallowed and transformed into godly power.

All miniature universes possessed the ability to transform godly powers, yet for Luo Feng, his “Beginning of the Origin” structure had enhanced this ability of transformation up to a level that was incredible beyond words.
