Chapter 1437: Nest

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He was left with no other choice. Although the best situation would be for him to hit 90,000 times life gene level while having attained the third stage of the godly power route, but in the face of an impending calamity, time was of the essence. There really was not much he could do, but becoming a true god at the second stage of the godly power route was still much better than those who became true gods through the law route.

“Father…”

A voice from the side disrupted Luo Feng’s thoughts. Luo Feng turned his head to look at his sons. From the eyes of Luo Ping and Luo Hai, Luo Feng could feel the brothers’ worry and unease.

“Rest assured.” Luo Feng stood up and patted the brothers on their shoulders. “Your father is confident!”

Both brothers heard their father’s words but still felt uneasy. Both were very aware of the news about the Sector Beast calamity. They were aware that during the calamity this time around, none of the other races would be able to stop it. Throughout the entire Universe Ocean, the only hope left was their father! Such tremendous stress! How was he going to bear it all?

“Of course.” Luo Feng’s hands rested on the brothers’ shoulders. “If your father is to fail, then your father and his sons—as well as your mother… Let’s just face annihilation together as a family. That way, at least we will all have each other’s company even in the face of death.”

Luo Ping and Luo Hai laughed. “Mm-hmm.” They agreed, nodding their heads vigorously.

“Go,” Luo Feng said.

The two brothers disappeared.

There was a trace of a smile in Luo Feng’s eyes. His two sons had undergone a trillion eras of honing and training their skills, so when it came to facing death, they were unfazed.

“If I fail, everything will be annihilated.”

Various scenes flashed through Luo Feng’s mind. His teacher, True Yan, Primal Chaos City Leader, his good friends, Rong Jun and many others, his parents, his wife, his sons, his younger brother… and the countless heroes who had sacrificed their lives fighting the devouring beast to ensure the survival of the earthlings…

Everything, if he failed, would be reduced to nothingness.

In preceding generations before the three reincarnation eras, great beings like Jie Fanzi had long been reduced to nothingness. Perhaps, within the three most dangerous lands, there might be words left behind as evidence that these great beings had existed once upon a time.

Within the faraway World of Jin, Luo Feng’s Earthling original body was within the East Army military camp. However, his godly body had started to collapse and disintegrate.

“That Sector Beast has escaped, and it is definitely not going to give up on revenge. This is just the calm before the storm… Regardless of whether I achieve a breakthrough to 90,000 times life gene level or not, the moment the final calamity occurs, I have to become a true god right away. And the moment I cross over to the level of a true god, my various bodies will merge to form my original body. Then, without a doubt, my earthling original body will have to return.”

Luo Feng stood within the stone house, yet his godly power was dispelling soundlessly and continuously, returning back to the World of Jin.

A short moment later, Luo Feng’s earthing original body was gone. Only the other body sustained by his godly power remained.

“Now, only my other body sustained by my godly power remains in the World of Jin.” Luo Feng’s other body remained in the stone house as he shook his head in silence. “I will have to put all visitation on hold for now and meet no one at all for the time being.”

Within Tilted Peak Sector of the three most dangerous lands of Universe Ocean, in the core region of Tilted Peak Sector, was the Land of Darkness.

Si!

Black skin and flesh were torn apart. Blood was splattered all over. A hideous head was devouring great mouthfuls as it crazily bit and tore at its prey.

“Hahaha… Hahaha…!” Tearing and biting, Sector Beast Morosa laughed as though it had gone mad. “I, Morosa, have turned the tables. I have actually succeeded!”

Its body was marred by injuries all over, and its second head was so badly torn that only half of it remained—clear indications of the extremely ferocious fights it had been involved in.

Battles among Sector Beasts were a completely different story than combat between a Sector Beast and a true god. When Sector Beasts and true gods fought, they could make use of the opposing nature of each other’s strengths to exhaust one another’s power, or the Sector Beast could easily split its to escape when the need arose.

But when Sector Beasts fought one another, the situation was different. Their powers were the same. And they jinxed one another by deploying the same means of fighting. For instance, if one Sector Beast divided itself into 99 different bodies, its opponent could do likewise! There was no way either could escape from the other!

“Morosa… if you feed on me now, in the future, you will suffer the same fate—being eaten up by another Sector Beast,” said a Sector Beast with a gaping hole in its chest. It howled in its unwillingness to be subjected to Morosa’s brutal and continuous devouring. It, too, only had one head left, which Morosa was presently feasting upon. “I was already severely injured before fighting you, but even so, you had such a difficult win that there is no way you can survive through all this.”

“What a fool.” Morosa devoured like mad as he cursed and swore. “Even though you are severely injured and might still be stronger than I am, when it comes to combat experience and techniques… you are so much more inferior.”

In the past, Morosa had stood at the peak of the Sector Beasts’ nest, second only to Beddy! Fighting persistently against one billion Sector Beasts to reach such a position, Morosa was definitely not short of combat experience. Even if it did lose out a little in its foundation, by relying on its techniques and experience made up for this shortcoming. Plus, its name alone could instill fear in its opponent even before the fighting began because opponents thought of the almighty Morosa of before. These factors contributed to it claiming the final victory!

“Devouring you will allow me to level up to the second stage!” Morosa bellowed. “Given my combat experience and fighting with other Sector Beasts at the second stage, my chances of winning are still high. In the future, I can still make my way back to the third stage.”

“The third stage? If your first step is slow, every step thereafter will also be slow. It is fated that you can never be the final king.”

The other Sector Beast, being bitten and torn apart, was drained of its power of resistance. This was because the most important vital point within its body had already been swallowed. Without this area, it was like a dry well. The Sector Beast was completely devoid of combat power.

“Previously, when I realized I was losing the battle, I had already spread news about you throughout the nest.” The dying beast seemed to have gone crazy and went on to say, “I said that, you, Morosa, had returned from the outside world, but that you had regressed by one stage. Even if you finish me off, your power might be at the level of a Sector Beast who has just entered the second stage. You are still extremely weak compared to many others in the nest. Those terrifying fellows who entered the third stage at the same time as you will most certainly seek you out to kill you.”

“You spread the news?” Morosa was slightly taken aback.

This was no great shock. It already expected as much.

Sector beasts were superior life forms who were born to destroy. If it had lain low and not done anything, the other Sector Beasts would never have known that it had dropped in levels. Yet, the moment it started attacking, any Sector Beast it fought against would immediately know the truth. If its opponent had won the fight, the truth about it might not have been disclosed; its opponent might have gone easy on it while basking in glory. Yet the moment its opponent were to lose the fight, the truth about might be disclosed simply as a means of revenge.

And the moment news about Morosa dropping levels was made public, Morosa would be such a defenseless target that any Sector Beast coming out of the nest would dare to attack it! This was also why it had gone crazy after being forced by Luo Feng to fall to the first stage. Morosa knew that to ascend back to the third stage from the first stage was as difficult as going to heaven.

“Afraid now?” the dying Sector Beast mocked.

“Afraid?” Morosa continued biting and tearing big mouthfuls as it continued to say, “It is fated that there will only be one final king. Since I have dropped all the way to the first stage, it is fated that I no longer have the chance to vie for the throne. My future will still be death, eventually. So now, if I have to face death earlier, does it make any difference?”

Internally, Morosa was burning with endless flames of fury. Even if it were to die, before dying, it had to take revenge on that human, Luo Feng, who had crushed its hopes!

“Luo Feng…” Morosa whispered this name silently to himself.

“You’ve ventured to the outside world. I’m afraid you have yet to learn a certain bit of news.” The dying Sector Beast was keen to grasp hold of any slightest chance to deal Morosa with a blow.

“What news?” Morosa looked indifferently at the dying Sector Beast, then took another big bite of it.

“Beddy…” The dying Sector Beast smirked. “Beddy has already attained the fourth stage. This news came from Batur before it died. Many Sector Beasts already know.”

“Before Batur died?” Morosa was taken aback. “No wonder it did not tell me!”

One billion Sector Beasts had been born. After that, they fought one another. The stronger, more powerful Sector Beasts naturally established their footing on the peak. Morosa was one of those at the peak. Batur was another. Both Morosa and Batur bore deep hatred for one another!

Batur had died—killed and swallowed by Beddy. Yet, at the same time, the battle had also allowed Batur to discover that Beddy was already a Sector Beast at the fourth stage. Naturally, it would spread this news before it died, even though it purposely left out some of its arch enemies from the list of parties to inform.

“The fourth stage!” Morosa froze as if doused with ice water.

The first step was slow, and every step after that was also slow. To become the final king, it had to never leave the First Group, where it used to be one of the members. The thing was, it had encountered Beddy’s endless pursuit with murderous intentions, so it had decided to head out to seek its own opportunities to rapidly ascend up to the pinnacle third stage in order to battle Beddy. It had not expected Beddy to actually make it to the fourth stage.

“The final king! No more hope. I… am fated to meet my doom. Then, before dying, I must take my revenge on that loathsome human who had crushed all my hopes!”

Morosa’s other head, the one that was injured, had completely recovered. With both heads drooping low, it was crazily tearing and biting the other Sector Beast, taking big mouthfuls ferociously.

“I will transmit the news to Beddy!” roared the dying Sector Beast. “You and Beddy have been fighting for endless eras… If Beddy knows you have become weak, it will definitely come after you. You are only at the second stage, and Beddy is at the fourth. Beddy’s speed far surpasses yours. There is no way you can escape.” The dying Sector Beast roared its intentions, then sniggered.

Morosa’s other head took another vicious bite, and the dying beast’s remaining head was bitten off.

Tear! Chi! Chi!

One big mouthful followed by another. Morosa devoured and swallowed.

The single eye on each of Sector Beast Morosa’s two heads flashed with icy-cold rays of light.

“Even if I, Morosa, have to die, I will first make Luo Feng pay the price!”

At the same time, it was carefully sensing the numerous Sector Beasts’ positions around it, especially those that were more powerful, like Beddy. Its main concern was to stay vigilant. The moment the more powerful ones like Beddy got closer to it, Morosa would immediately flee as far away as he could.

Deep within the Sector Beast nest, a huge, black figure lay sprawled on a floating desert rock.

Whoo!

It suddenly sat upright and looked far off into the distance. Both hideous-looking heads looked in the same direction at the same time. The single eye on each head seemed to have some vague, colorful lights revolving within as they looked coldly into the distance.

“Morosa…” it mumbled in a hoarse voice. “You have dropped levels and returned to the first stage? From birth, you and I have been fighting and vying against one another. Previously, when you suffered a crushing defeat, you left the nest with grave injuries. Yet you return, and you have regressed to the first stage.”

A pinnacle first stage, killing a second-stage Sector Beast that was severely injured… It seemed difficult.

However, Beddy did not find it strange. This was its long-time opponent Morosa! This opponent had once posed a great threat to it. But now, this opponent had painstakingly made its way back up to the second stage, but Beddy had already reached the fourth stage. Within the entire Sector Beast nest, it was currently the one and only being known to have reached the fourth stage.

Toward the later stages, the distances between the successive stages were even more exaggerated. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“How could a life form from Universe Ocean be so powerful?” Beddy said in its low, hoarse voice. “Who could cause Morosa to be reduced to such a sorry state? Could it be the one Dragon Rock and Zhen Jia mentioned…? The Universe Ocean Number One Master, Milky Way Horde Leader?”
