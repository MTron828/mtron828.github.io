Chapter 1284: Brutality

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The outburst of the two great palace type supreme true treasures, Black Prison Tower and Empress Palace, unleashed terrifying gravitational force. The two camps of universe masters went completely wild with violence.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Both sides had fallen into an intense fight. The united force of the three races had a total of 112 universe masters. Adding on the other bodies of certain universe masters, the total number of godly bodies in that force exceeded 120!

As for the human camp, with a starting count of 92 universe masters (including Darkness Master), after adding on the other bodies of certain universe masters, their total count exceeded 100!

With so many universe masters gathered in the same place and countless attacks occurring at the same time, the level of energy was continuously changing and expanding! The attack powers from both sides were almost at the eighth tier, and the universe supreme masters could only execute theirs at sixth-tier as the top, which meant that the moment they were hit by an attack, they might be thrown far away into the distance by the impact.

“Kill!”

“Kill the group of demons, bugs, and automaton race!”

“I have never exchanged blows with the universe masters of the bug clan before, yet now, so many universe masters are attacking together. This… This is simply satisfying.”

The numerous universe masters were highly excited. All burned with passion.

When over 100 godly bodies executed their techniques at the same time, the outburst of energy formed an “energy domain” of an area of a million kilometers around them. It was like when universe supreme masters burned their godly powers to get their godly powers to rise up; the energy generated could expel Golden Kingdom and Snow Sand Ocean within a small surrounding area. Not to mention the combined power of over 100 universe masters.

Hong! Hong!

Their opponents were attacking like crazy. But when they charged into this energy domain, their energies were vigorously consumed. Regardless of what kind of technique—godly power attack, soul attack, or illusion attack—all of the attacks were collectively worn out the moment they reached the energy domain, even before anything could reach these universe masters.

“Too powerful! When so many of us universe masters join forces, we become overwhelmingly powerful. Even universe supreme beings will mean nothing to us.”

“Even a top-tier true treasure, when confronted by our combined attack, will most likely be shattered to pieces.”

“Of course, it will shatter. Previously, some silly fool from the united force of the three races sent a blow across the void space with his blade, and that top-tier true treasure blade was reduced to powder and dust right away!”

******

Satisfaction! Universe masters from both camps were killing to their hearts’ content. They were universe masters, after all. When would they get the chance to experience such an outburst of power that was so overwhelmingly strong? Even universe supreme masters could not beat them. This was an execution of an attack with formidable power, and, indeed, it brought them the utmost satisfaction.

Both sides were executing their attack techniques. The power of certain attacks, upon execution, was worn out by the surrounding energy domain as the universe masters fought their way through while resisting their enemy’s attack. Some others were able to charge through the surrounding energy domain to reach their enemy’s camp, yet their powers were eventually worn out upon entering the enemy’s energy domain.

The number of godly bodies within the human camp might have been more than 100, but this number was still smaller than that of the united force of the three races. They had to focus more on defense and less on attacks! If they could at least put up a strong defense, they could block off the attacks. Then everything should work out fine.

*******

“The combined force of our attack,” Father God of the automaton race said via voice transmission, “must have scared Luo Feng and Peng Gong Master into hiding in the Boat of Mausoleum. Since they are not coming out, we shall change course and target our attacks at that group of universe masters! Shock Horn, Dream Tea, Empress, we shall join in the attacks to help the universe masters on our force.”

“All right.”

“With us joining forces, our attack power will surely be able to surpass the eighth tier and go beyond this level.”

“We shall wait for the chance to kill those universe masters. This war… We are going to fight a winning battle.”

The four universe supreme masters made up their minds instantly.

Amidst the void space in the dark universe, there were thousands of automaton puppets. They had been encircling the Boat of Mausoleum but were unable to do anything against it. Exasperated, the entire puppet troop simply could not be bothered anymore. They roared loudly with their mouths wide open. That was when the first streak of light in the shape of an arc was spat into the air. Shortly after, thousands of arc-shaped streaks of light started to appear and combine with one another. Finally, the convergence was completed to form a sharp arc of light.

Hua!

The arc of light swept toward Black Prison Tower.

“Go!” roared Shock Demon Ancestor, a beast with a serrated shell.

A cone-shaped image appeared and transformed into a dark storm. Then it dashed toward Black Prison Tower right away.

“Humans!” Dream Demon Ancestor let out a hoarse shout and shot out a cyan-colored shadow from the mouth of its gigantic snake’s head.

“Humph!” Beneath the attack of a large crowd of universe masters, a large quantity of dazzling, golden light was suddenly seen from Empress Palace.

At that moment, all four universe supreme masters were attacking at the same time.

Every universe supreme master was equivalent to 10 universe masters, so with the four universe supreme masters attacking at the same time, the power that could be executed by 120 godly bodies instantly soared to that of 160 godly bodies. After combining the attacks by the four supreme masters, the energy level once again underwent a change to completely surpass that of the eighth-tier energy level.

Hong! Long! Long!

Endless attacks were on the way. The energy domain of the human camp was instantly suppressed to only one-tenth of its previous area of influence. The violent attacks from the united forces of the three races could even prevent the attacks by universe masters of the human camp from surging out of their energy domain! All that the universe masters from the human camp could manage to do was rush about, resisting attacks and defending themselves.

“Too strong!”

“Unable to block!”

“If this goes on, there will definitely be problems. Once the energy domain that we are defending has a flaw, that single weak point will cause the entire storm of violent attacks to sweep its way in. Then we are bound to see our universe masters being annihilated.”

“This cannot go on.”

The entire human camp was in a state of panic, bustling about helter-skelter. In the face of such overwhelming attacks, 100 godly bodies were forced to resist powerful attacks equivalent to 160 godly bodies. The more great beings there were, the more the power would go on increasing progressively, so the difference in power between both sides could now be estimated as two to three times. The human camp was bracing itself to last for as long as it could.

“Under such pressure, even if there isn’t a weak point, the consumption of our godly bodies alone will be our undoing. If we lose 50 percent of our godly bodies, our power will only be left with 10 percent! Following the consumption of our godly bodies, our combat power will be reduced progressively, too… On the other hand, the united force of the three races has the help of four supreme masters. In terms of consumption, no matter how long this war takes, the four supreme masters can easily maintain at least the sixth tier as the top level of combat power.”

The humans were no fools. They could, after all, become universe masters. They all knew they were in a dangerous situation.

******

Within the Boat of Mausoleum, Luo Feng and Peng Gong Master had just witnessed the crossfire between the universe masters from both camps. They were lamenting over their observations when they saw the four supreme masters joining the battle.

“Luo Feng! Peng Gong! If the both of you are still not going to enter the field, things are going to go awry very soon.” Darkness Master transmitted a voice message with a tone of harshness.

Peng Gong transmitted his reply to Darkness Master. “The crossfire has only just begun. We are not needed there yet. Up until now, the battle has only gone on for a while. The godly bodies of our universe masters should be barely consumed at all.”

“Don’t spout nonsense.” Darkness Master was highly anxious. “Why don’t you come here and try it for yourself? The power of their attacks is much too strong! The moment we lose our defense, I’m afraid we will start to see the annihilation of our universe masters. If we drag on for too long, following the continued consumption of godly bodies, our ability to resist will gradually weaken. Luo Feng, when do you intend to counterattack?”

Luo Feng frowned and shouted his decision right away. “Peng Gong, let’s take the field together!”

“All right,” Peng Gong said. He squinted, but through the pair of slits, his eyes were flashing with insanity.

Hong!

]The speed of the Boat of Mausoleum skyrocketed suddenly and sharply. Then, without further ado, it dashed into the distance, moving toward the camp of the united force of the three races. The Boat of Mausoleum was so mighty that those automaton puppets did not even dare to stand in its way. The moment it came charging toward them, even Father God of the automaton race, who had previously been so arrogant, immediately ceased the attacks of his puppet troop.

Father God of the automaton race transmitted his orders. “Shock Horn, Dream Tea, Empress, you all will continue to attack the human universe masters of the human camp. This Luo Feng and Peng, leave them to me.”

“All right.”

“Automaton, you must block them both.”

“Beware of Luo Feng. He has received the inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River. Who knows? He might have some other strange treasures.”

Father God of automaton race transmitted his reply. “Don’t worry. I have never let my guard down before.”

Thousands of automaton puppets were seen to have flocked around the Boat of Mausoleum. When the Boat of Mausoleum’s speed soared from 100 times light speed to several hundred times light speed, those puppets did likewise. When the entire Boat of Mausoleum was about to collide with that black sphere— Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Hua!

The Boat of Mausoleum vanished into thin air. Luo Feng and Peng Gong appeared in midair.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

The moment they appeared, both executed their attacks at the same time.

“Break!”

Luo Feng wielded Blood Ghost Blade, and the blade became insanely huge. From tens of thousands of kilometers of length, the blade speedily expanded to a length of at least 100 million kilometers. The sharp edges grew especially big while the handle remained the same size as before. This gigantic Blood Ghost Blade could not be bothered with the automaton puppets at all. Instead, it hacked murderously at the duo made up of Shock Demon Ancestor and Dream Demon Ancestor!

“Empress of the bug clan, you should accept one rod, too!” Yan Jun Rod also expanded tremendously in Peng Gong Master’s grip, who viciously thrust it far into the distance at Empress Palace!

With a hack and a thrust, the two paid no attention to the automaton puppets and instead directed all their attacks at Shock Demon Ancestor, Dream Demon Ancestor, and Empress Palace.

******

Shock Demon Ancestor, Dream Demon Ancestor, and the Empress of the bug clan were exceptionally great beings. Of course, given their status, they would be clearly aware that the critical factor determining the victorious party in this war was none other than the group of universe masters of each force! So they paid no heed to Luo Feng and Peng Gong Master’s attacks and continued to pour out their individual powers, directing repeated attacks at the human universe masters within Black Prison Tower.

But as for Blood Ghost Blade hacking onto the bodies of Shock Demon Ancestor and Dream Demon Ancestor…

The idea of a sixth-tier top-level kind of attack injuring a universe supreme master was a joke. Such an attack could, at most, knock these two universe supreme masters back a short distance.

“Let’s not bother with those two humans,” Shock Demon Master said, transmitting a voice message. “Automaton, they have the Boat of Mausoleum. That’s why they can barge their way through. There is no way you can try to obstruct them… Since that is the case, you might as well ignore them both. A sixth-tier attack? Humph! It won’t be able to hurt us at all. We just need to focus on attacking that group of universe masters.”

The Empress of the bug clan also transmitted her voice message. “Right, universe masters of the human camp are already starting to get flustered. The moment a loophole appears, their universe masters are bound to face annihilation… Thereafter, the number of deaths on their side will increase. We must win this war.”

“All right.” Father God of Automaton clan also decided that he should no longer be bothered with Luo Feng and Peng Gong.

******

This instantly caused Luo Feng and Peng Gong Master to get anxious and angry, but there was nothing they could do. After all, the primal universe might be able to suppress the attack power of these supreme masters. It was not able to suppress their defensive ability.

Darkness Master transmitted another voice message out of anxiety. “Luo Feng, Peng Gong, right now, the majority of our universe masters’ godly bodies are basically over 95 percent. But if this situation persists, the consumption of their godly bodies will increase beyond control. And now, just putting up defense alone, is exhausting them!”

Peng Gong Master transmitted a voice message too. “Luo Feng and I are getting anxious, too! But the four supreme masters are too vigilant. Even when they have such a great advantage over us, there isn’t the slightest intention of leaving our universe masters alone. Now, we need to counterattack… It is almost impossible if we are intending to apprehend all the universe masters from both sides in one move. It is already very tough trying to apprehend the universe masters from one side, not to mention two sides.”

Luo Feng was worried sick. Universe masters within the camp of the united force of the three races were divided into three places. Empress Palace had 80, the vessel belonging to the demons had 16, and the black sphere of Father God of the automaton race had 16! Although Luo Feng and company were unable to determine an accurate number, those great beings were standing in easily observable spots like the edge of the hole’s opening or the edge of cabin doors, so it would be possible to come up with a rough estimate of their numbers.

Luo Feng had initially intended to wipe out all the universe masters of the opposing force that the two demon ancestors and Father God of automaton race were protecting. But now…

Through gritted teeth, Luo Feng transmitted his voice message. “I don’t care anymore. If this goes on, not only will we not win, but we might even suffer a crushing defeat. Counterattack!”
