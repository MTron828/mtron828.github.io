Chapter 1260: Humans

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Huge Axe universe was one of the two miniature universes owned by humans. Teacher Origin had been suppressed a long time ago, so the primal universe didn’t change completely. Not many humans lived in the primal universe. Instead, the peerless talents and great beings gathered in the primal universe. As for Huge Axe universe, it had changed completely, so many ordinary life forms lived there.

“What happened?”

“The sky is cracked!”

In an area in Huge Axe universe, the families of Huge Axe Dojo and the elites were all panicked. The peaceful sky suddenly had a giant crack in it. The sky started to collapse. Space trembled, and there were occasionally space cracks. Some unlucky humans lost half their bodies or were even annihilated.

Hong! Long! Long!

The land started to crack.

“Quick, quick! Everyone, gather! Don’t act alone!” An emperor looked anxious and put the humans inside his world ring by teleporting time and time again.

Inside the space were 12 universe knights and 399 emperors who could perform teleportation. They were all putting the human elites back into their world rings, and “Hong” was one of them.

“Brother, the space is crumbling. Quick, take the elites of our race and go to the main space. Be quick!” The voice of Hong’s brother, Tie Bi Knight, was still echoing in his ears. He was a disciple of Huge Axe Creator.

“Yes,” said Hong.

One teleportation after another, he put a great many human elites into his world ring, but Hong was worried, anxious, and terrified. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The keepsake left by my teacher now has no owner,” said Hong, horrified. “This is left by my teacher with my teacher’s life imprint on it, yet it doesn’t have an owner anymore. This miniature universe belongs to my teacher, but now, it’s starting to crumble. Did Teacher really die?”

Hong grew even more anxious. He knew how important his teacher Huge Axe Creator was to the human race, as he was their only universe supreme master! He was the cornerstone of the human race! Yet the cornerstone was gone now!

They were all fleeing.

Hong put the most important elites in the world ring one by one. As for those less important, before they could even take half of them, they heard an order: “Go to the main space now. Otherwise, you will no longer be able to leave!”

“Everyone!”

“Everyone! Quick!”

The universe knights and emperors took a look at the humans who were being crushed. They were screaming.

“Help us!”

“Help us, Nuo Fan He clan!”

“Take us, please!”

“Take my child!”

However, those emperors and universe knights didn’t hesitate, as they were carrying the most important elites. If they weren’t decisive enough, they—along with those elites—wouldn’t be able to make it.

Shua! Shua! Shua!

From the crumbling area, Hong and the others fled to the main space. After only a few seconds, the crumbling spread to the portal.

Hong saw three towering beings after entering the main space. They were Void Gold Master, Lan Cang Master, and Ancestral Tree Knight.

“Quick, quick.”

Void Gold Master and Lan Cang Master were both universe masters from Huge Axe Dojo, while Ancestral Tree Knight was a top-tier universe overlord, so they could survive even if the miniature universe crumbled and the chaos air flow penetrated the miniature universe. However, many universe knights and undying fighters couldn’t survive in Universe Ocean.

“Come in.”

“Gather!” Void Gold Master gave an order. He teleported again and again and took away all the emperors and universe knights!

Hong arrived at the main space and was taken into the world ring by Void Gold Master. Everything changed.

Almost 1,000 humans stood on the plain. They all looked horrified, as they couldn’t believe what had just happened.

“Brother.” Tie Bi Knight stood beside Hong and transmitted his voice to him. “Did the keepsake our teacher gave you change?”

Hong nodded. “Still an object without any owner.”

“Same here…” Tie Bi Knight looked upset. “Did teacher just…? He’s so powerful. He’s a universe supreme master!”

“The spaces in the miniature universe, including the main space, started to crumble.” Hong also looked upset. “Teacher…”

******

Inside the main space of Huge Axe Universe, Void Gold Master, Lan Cang Master, and Ancestral Tree Knight stood in the sky, and the membrane of the miniature universe already showed cracks. The chaos airflow penetrated the small universe. It was the purest chaos airflow, unlike that of the primal universe.

“Quick, let’s go to other spaces and see whether we can save more or not,” ordered Void Gold Master.

“Yes.”

“Let’s go.”

They separated and teleported to one space after another.

It was urgent, so they saved the elites first. The elites were those selected from the original universe! They had great potential, so they were saved first. And then, the families were saved. Those families were of the universe masters or universe knights of Huge Axe Dojo.

Hong! Long!

The land with a diameter of 100 billion kilometers started to collapse, and the space fragments were detached. Some of the space fragments contained lands where humans were struggling. When they saw the towering Void Gold Master show up, they were excited.

Void Gold Master teleported and moved forward, trying to save those humans on the space fragments.

On the independent dimension of the virtual universe.

On the two sides of the bench in front of Huge Axe Godly Palace, the universe masters sat down, looking solemn. Each of the universe masters could feel the terrifying pressure.

“Void Gold, how’s Huge Axe Universe?” asked Primal Chaos City Leader.

Void Gold Master sighed. “We could only save the undying fighters, universe knights and the important elites. As for the others, we can only save part of them. Lan Cang, Ancestral Tree Knight, and I are still saving them, but only a small number can survive.”

“Elites are the ones that really matter.” Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “Huge Axe Universe started to crumble, and those who die are only a small loss to us humans. However, if we can’t cope with it well, we’ll suffer billions of times worse!”

Luo Feng was horrified. What should they do?

“Without question, the death of Huge Axe is catastrophic to us,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “The map is fake. Who set this whole thing up? Why did Huge Axe die so quickly in Land of Darkness? These are all mysteries… I know that you all want to figure it out and avenge Huge Axe. However, for us humans, we need to put it behind first!”

“Finding out the murders and means of revenge—these are things to do later. Do you all understand?” Primal Chaos City Leader looked around the universe masters present.

“We do.”

“The fate of humans is the most important now!”

“Though we all want to figure it out, we’re not powerful enough. Even if we figure out who, we can’t do anything about it.” The universe masters all nodded.

They were all the top seniors of the human race. They had Huge Axe Creator protect them before, so things were easy for them, yet Huge Axe Creator was dead now; they needed to deal with everything themselves. They needed to think from the standpoint of the entire human race.

“Okay,” Primal Chaos City Leader said, relieved. It was important to stick together. “Huge Axe died. The small universe started to crumble, and lots of beings within our race know about it. As for other races like the bug race, the automaton race, and the demon race, they all have spies within our race, so they’ll know about it in no time! Besides, great beings go on adventures in Universe Ocean, and it won’t take a long time for them to know that Huge Axe Universe has crumbled.”

“Okay.” They all nodded. They understood that within the human race, some spies had their souls controlled. And in Universe Ocean, it wouldn’t take long for the universe masters to notice that Huge Axe Universe had crumbled. Then they would all know that Huge Axe Creator had died!

“A universe supreme master is extremely important to a race,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “They can control a vast area, and they can show up in lots of places in no time. They can revive universe overlords, as well. Without a universe supreme master, a race can’t even protect itself. We occupy an important territory, so there’s no way the other races will not be tempted.”

The bug race, the demon race, the automaton race, and the humans… These four races occupied the best area of the universe! Beings born in this area had greater potential! Just like the desert area Sitting Mountain Guest lived in couldn’t breed any living beings. Even though the original universe was enormous, some territories could breed lots of great beings while others couldn’t, which was why there were struggles. The four pinnacle races occupied the best four areas.

“Besides, territory struggles never end,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Luo Feng received the Duan Dong River inheritance. That was okay when Huge Axe was here, but now, Huge Axe has died… Who doesn’t want the inheritance of Duan Dong River? We must prepare for war! Remember, when Huge Axe died, we humans were forced into a different era. A more difficult era!”
