Chapter 1173: The Spirit of a Supreme True Treasure

There were three scratches on the fine lines of the blood-stained white wings. Luo Feng was baffled. Any one of those blade-rays that spread all over space during the endless blade storm was even more frightening than the attack of any universe supreme master! This pair of white wings was undoubtedly a supreme true treasure.

Based on common knowledge, supreme true treasures could not be damaged! Even within the three most dangerous lands, the same theory applied.

“Damaged? How can it be damaged?” Luo Feng was confused. “Scratches? How did that happen? Which dreadfully scary fellow could have scratched it? Or was it caused by a certain uniquely dangerous environment within the core domain of the three most dangerous lands?”

Various thoughts flooded Luo Feng’s mind instantly. Something that could scratch these supreme true treasure wings—and even stain them with blood… There must have been a story behind this.

Although he was shocked and confused, Luo Feng managed to stay level-headed. Since setting foot in Universe Ocean, he had grown to understand the area better through the information he acquired and had gained an understanding about certain matters…

The Universe Ocean was simply too mysterious! The great beings of any reincarnation era could only live up to a maximum of three reincarnation eras (apart from the two holy grounds). Up to that very day, no one was able to explore beyond the boundaries of Universe Ocean.

A large quantity of miniature universes, including the countless ones that had been destroyed, were all limited in size. Except for the two holy grounds universes, they were extremely big! A miniature universe was the creation of a universe supreme master. As for the two existences that left behind the two holy grounds miniature universes… what level would their powers have reached? Until now, there was no relevant information.

“To be able to scratch this pair of supreme true treasure wings, I guess only the two existences who created the two holy grounds universes could achieve that,” Luo Feng hypothesized. “But there is no information about them at all.”

Of course, he was only speculating. The Universe Ocean was full of secrets. Even he was in a state of bewilderment.

He looked at the pair of white wings from afar—those dazzling wings!

“Something must have happened to them, but I cannot be bothered. What I need to do now is to get ahold of this supreme true treasure.”

Luo Feng knelt on one knee and placed both palms on the floor to endure the crazy waves of oppressive willpower. That self-contented and insane willpower was roaring.

“Get lost! You bastard, get lost, or I will kill you! Kill you! Advance!”

Luo Feng gritted his teeth as he manipulated Star Tower. The oppressive willpower was frightening. The intensity was only second to the time when Star Tower had gone through a life and death ordeal. Back then, the pain during the fusion with Tower Pearl had been excruciating. The pain now was quite tormenting, but it was nothing compared to the previous one.

45 kilometers… 40 kilometers… This oppressive willpower spread in all directions, and the closer it got to the white wings, the more intense the oppression was. This intensity did not increase by mere degrees. Instead, it was a surge in level.

36 kilometers… 34 kilometers… 32 kilometers… 30 kilometers… 28 kilometers…

“Ah!”

Luo Feng trembled all over. His eyes were bloodshot, and blood was pulsating through his veins. The surrounding space around him trembled as his muscles, viscera, and bones howled as though his life depended on it… Even Luo Feng found it so unbearable that he had to let out a small cry.

Pain! It was horrendous agony!

“I can tolerate it! This is not the limit yet!” Luo Feng said, telling himself to bear with the pain.

He was closing on the distance. 22 kilometers… 20 kilometers… 18 kilometers…

Luo Feng was starting to get attacks of syncope, intermittently blacking out. The oppressive willpower was making him fall into a deep slumber, yet it also seemed to be easing up on him while continuing to roar, “Bastard! Loathsome bastard, you think you can get close to me? Haha, far from it! Bastard, quickly take your leave, and I shall spare your life.”

“Stop!” Luo Feng gritted his teeth but still was unable to stop them from chattering.

At 16 kilometers away, he finally stopped. This was only a hair’s breadth away from the true limit between life and death, but it was already dangerously near. Luo Feng dared not intrude further.

The white wings were still unleashing endless blades, which gave form to those dazzling, gigantic light wings.

At 16 kilometers away from the white wings, Star Tower stopped.

In the main control room, Luo Feng was seated cross-legged with his eyes closed, silently fighting the impact by the oppressive willpower. Thereafter, he eased into gradual adaptation to the impact. The oppression was gradually reduced.

After half a year, Luo Feng opened his eyes.

“Under such suppression, my own willpower was able to undergo a honing process, allowing me to steel myself. This was my gain after all.”

Luo Feng smiled. Then, he looked out at the white wings.

“I must lay hands on this pair of wings.” Luo Feng said with an intention in mind.

Right away, a trace of godly power flew out of Star Tower. As the white wings released blade-rays on a two-dimensional plane level to its light wings, there were no blade-rays at the front or back of it for a full 10,000 kilometers.

Gigantic, dazzling light wings that spread out to give rise to a blade storm might have swept through space. Yet 10,000 kilometers from the closest two sides of these white wings, there was not a single trace of a blade-ray to be found.

“Godly power, get closer!”

Luo Feng manipulated his thread of godly power and directed it toward the white wings.

“Get lost!” The oppressive willpower charged at his godly power right away.

Peng!

Godly power dispersed. Every trace of godly power had its own life imprints and willpower and thus, naturally would be easily annihilated.

“Seems like this is not going to work. Star Tower, grow longer!” Luo Feng manipulated from within.

“Longer!”

“Longer!”

“Longer!”

Star Tower grew longer rapidly, and its tower peak got nearer to the white wings. However, the godly power from within Star Tower was still under the impact of that oppressive willpower, so even though the tower was growing bigger, the godly power it could exert was partial where the topmost region of the tower peak remaining void of godly power.

“Hook onto it!”

Star Tower was a nine-story tower, so naturally, its edges would be able to hook onto the wings. As Star Tower grew increasingly larger, gradually closing the distance to the white wings. Finally, the tower reached the white wings; the edge of the tower was a full 100 kilometers, and the white wings were only 100 meters, so, theoretically speaking, holding onto the white wings should be easy.

Peng!

The moment Star Tower’s peak touched the white wings, the feeling evoked felt as though an ant had rammed against a mighty mountain. The wings did not even budge!

“I’m ramming into them, yet they did not move at all?”

Luo Feng could not believe his eyes. First, he maneuvered Star Tower into moving back slightly, then he charged forward suddenly while accelerating.

Bang!

Hong!

Star Tower’s peak rammed into the white wings ruthlessly. Yet the white wings continued to unleash endless blade-rays that converged to form dazzling light wings. Star Tower’s attempt to crash into the white wings proved futile. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Damn! This—this…!”

Luo Feng’s eyes widened. Back when Star Tower was involved in battles in the outer domain, it was a treasure without a master, so it could not move about on its own. But due to its massive size, other great beings were unable to move it either.

“This pair of white wings before me is small,” said Luo Feng. “The wings are only 100 meters in size, yet my Star Tower, after reaching a massive size of a few thousand kilometers, is unable to cause it to budge at all?”

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Star Tower was like a mallet banging the ancient, massive bell, ramming into the sides of the white wings from a horizontal angle repeatedly; it even retreated to accelerate to a dozen times the speed of light to continue ramming into the white wings.

“It really is not moving at all?” Luo Feng was a little stunned. “What should I do? If my godly power wanted to get closer but is unable to, then there is no way I can get hold of those white wings.”

Luo Feng was getting frustrated. It was a piece of supreme true treasure that was only 16 kilometers away in midair, but it was unleashing endless power, demonstrating its capability. Luo Feng was at his wit’s end.

Time passed with Luo Feng thinking of new ways to try every day, yet every trial resulted in failure. However, Luo Feng was reluctant to give up. After all, this was a supreme true treasure. Luo Feng could now empathize with the helplessness the four pinnacle races felt when they had all fought hard for Star Tower, but none had been able to get the Tower to recognize a master.

With a twinkling of an eye, nine days passed.

“Bastard, get lost! There is no way you can lay hands on the wings. Get lost! Don’t court your doom.”

The oppressive willpower had never stopped for a breather, but Luo Feng had grown accustomed to the impact of this oppressive willpower.

Suddenly—

An intangible wave transmitted by the white wings in a split-second reached deep within Star Tower and into Luo Feng’s mind.

“Human,” an ancient voice said.

Sitting cross-legged, Luo Feng’s eyes lit up. He clearly felt a willpower that was different from the first one. “Who are you?”

“I am the spirit of the wings true treasure,” the ancient voice said.

Luo Feng was a little taken aback but not completely shocked. It was just like how his supreme true treasure, Star Tower, had a spirit of its own, albeit with a low intelligence level. It was like a child—easily coaxed. This pair of wings seemed to be much more mature.

“I did not expect this,” the ancient voice said. “That I would actually have a component in the outside world.”

“You did not expect to…?” Luo Feng was shocked.

“I once joined my master in a major battle where he was annihilated,” the ancient voice explained. “His wings were damaged, and the original spirit of the wings was also destroyed. I am a newly born spirit, so I can only recall snippets of the battle. I vaguely recall one blow from our enemy, but the rest is entirely forgotten. Since birth, I have been here. I thought I was a sole existence, but it seems like there are another two pairs of wings. Judging from their powers, though, I must be the core, while the other two pairs constitute parts of me.”

Luo Feng was secretly awestruck. A major battle? Damaged wings with the original spirit destroyed…?

“How did you know that your master had been annihilated?” Luo Feng could not help asking.

“I am an object without a master, so naturally my master must have been annihilated,” the spirit of the wings said. “Human, I have been trapped here for countless ages. I want to leave. But… I am unable to. I need your help.”

“Help?” Luo Feng asked persistently. “How can I help you?”

“There are four bloodstains on my wings,” the spirit of the wings began. “Within each bloodstain, there is a terrifying power and willpower. For time beyond measure, I have been suppressing it, wanting to destroy it. In all that time, I only managed to expel one. There are three remaining… Only if I can suppress and expel them all can my full potential be unleashed. Do you see the injury on my wings?”

“Yes,” Luo Feng replied.

“I’m injured. Expelling the three bloodstains is difficult. I need some precious true treasures. I will have to swallow these true treasures to facilitate my self-restoration. Now, I need your help. If you can provide me with enough true treasures to help my self-restoration, I am willing to recognize you as my master. But do bear in mind that I have very stringent requirements when it comes to recognizing a master.

“One, you must have the perfect life genes. Two, your willpower must be strong enough. If you are an undying fighter, your willpower must be comparable to a universe knight. If you are a universe knight, your willpower must be comparable to a universe master. If you are a universe master, your willpower must be comparable to a universe supreme master. What a pity. I see that your willpower is only on the level of a universe master. You still need to improve and increase further.”

Listening to the voice of this spirit of the wings, Luo Feng was extremely calm. But suddenly, his heart gave a sudden throb.

Something is not right! A sudden realization dawned upon Luo Feng. It is lying to me!
