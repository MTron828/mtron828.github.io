Chapter 1224: The Ancestors

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Within the vast Universe Ocean, only the two holy land universes, namely Purple Moon Holy Land Universe and East Emperor Holy Land Universe, were able to transcend and survive through the reincarnation era. Yet speaking of the longest history, strongest power, deepest foundation… naturally, the winner was the East Emperor Holy Land Universe, which had existed up until now, was still an unknown figure to all.

Within the East Emperor Holy Land Universe, there was the Endless Godly Sector, a place where 90 percent of the entire holy land universe’s undying godly spirits, 99 percent of its universe knights, all its universe masters, and all its universe supreme masters gathered. The entire place was beautiful and magnificent, peaceful and tranquil; there were countless buildings of different cultural styles, and various rare flowers and plants could be found everywhere.

“Ang! Bang! Woo! Roar! Hush! Hai!”

In the middle of Endless Godly Sector, there was a towering green tree that connected everything within the whole godly sector and was constantly transmitting sounds out in a multidirectional manner to spread the news to all parts of the godly sector.

This big tree was ancient and deep green. It was very upright and towering, and all around it, there were many vines that were like jade carvings. When the wind blew, the tree gently swayed along, giving out intermittent bouts of soul-captivating voices; many figures were currently seated cross-legged under this ancient tree. At one glance, there was seemingly no end to the sea of people.

“Boom!” With a sudden jolt, the entire big tree radiated a dazzling cyan light.

“Boom!” Then the cyan light was transformed into an endless red light.

“Boom!” The towering tree went on to emit an endless black light.

“Boom!” It was transformed into endless blue light.

“Boom!” Last of all was a dazzling golden light.

Thereafter, the entire ancient tree was encircled by layers of apertures—five layers to be exact, so dazzling and resplendent that at that point in time, the entire Endless Godly Sector could see the tree in this glorious state.

“Ancestor tree!”

“Ancestor tree has shown its five-colored light halo. Ancestor will make his appearance soon.”

“Ancestor will make his appearance soon.”

“Ancestor!”

The moment the numerous godly spirits, undying fighters, universe knights, and even universe masters—who were all originally seated cross-legged under the towering, ancient trees—saw the five-colored light halo surging out from the Ancestor tree where they were all enveloped in a surrounding so dense with airflow… they were all shocked and excited. There were even some undying godly spirits who immediately burst into loud sobs while others fell to their knees trembling in excitement.

Ancestor!

East Emperor Holy Land Universe, an existence that had been around for an eternity! Ancestor “East Emperor” was the supreme being of all living souls within the whole of East Emperor Holy Land Universe.

Yet, throughout the endless years that passed, Ancestor East Emperor was practically nonexistent, as he almost never appeared. Even many universe masters who lived through many rounds of reincarnations had never seen him in person before! Not to mention the world out of Universe Ocean… Beyond Universe Ocean, not a single great being had ever met this Ancestor of the two holy land universes.

This was why Ancestor was known as the first great being of Universe Ocean!

However, when compared with the Ancestor of the two holy land universes who had long transcended reincarnation, Ancestor East Emperor, was still a notch lower. Yet even within the two holy land universes, it was extremely difficult for them to catch a glimpse of their own ancestors. Even for this ancient East Emperor to make an appearance, the chances were so slim that it was pathetic, and every time he made an appearance, the Ancestor tree would display this five-colored light halo.

“Ancestor is going to appear soon!”

“Ancestor!”

Even all the universe masters in their own palaces were shocked and excited.

“From birth until today, I have lived through a total of 82 reincarnation eras, but not once have I met Ancestor. Ancestor is finally going to appear.” A universe master was so excited that he forgot all about his disciples and teleported himself right away to where Ancestor Tree was.

“The last time I met Ancestor was 119 reincarnation eras ago.”

“Ancestor has appeared!”

Craziness! All of Endless Godly Sector seemed to have fallen into a crazy state. This was the heart of the most ancient holy land universe—the very core of their pride. So proud of it were they that they vaguely started to look down on Purple Moon Holy Land Universe! And from the size of a holy land universe, one could also tell… their East Emperor Ancestor was much more powerful than the Purple Moon Ancestor!

It was an absolute pride, and they highly regarded East Emperor Ancestor with utmost admiration.

Numerous streams of light appeared and gathered at the bottom of Ancestor tree.

Countless great beings floated in midair. Those who dared float in midair were at least universe masters or universe supreme masters! At one glance close to 1,000 beings were in midair, scattered all around Ancestor tree. Each and every one was silently waiting, in full deference, for their almighty Ancestor.

“Ang! Bang! Woo! Roar! Hush! Hai!”

An inexplicable voice suddenly sounded loudly. Every great being present was intoxicated by this sound, including the few universe supreme masters.

Amidst a strange music… an immensely dazzling figure appeared out of thin air, high up in the sky. It wore a robe that was covered with countless green branches and leaves, and the robe was radiating an intensely hazy cyan light that was rich in vigor and life. The intense cyan-green light shone upon and enveloped the hundreds of millions of great beings waiting and kneeling beneath it, comforting them all. Instantly, those whose injured godly bodies were damaged were completely healed.

Hua!

All the living souls, regardless of whether they were undying or universe supreme masters, gave him their full attention. Then, respectfully, they all shouted in unison, “Ancestor!”

There was total silence as all the living souls looked up at Ancestor East Emperor with burning gazes.

East Emperor looked down at them all… His entire body was bathed in the intense cyan light that seemed to obscure him from clarity. Even the few universe supreme masters and few hundred universe masters could feel a supremely oppressive force come over them, albeit an invisible one.

“I heard that within the Universe Boat of the three most dangerous lands in the Universe Ocean, there has been the birth of an inheritance. This is the inheritance of Duan Dong River Wu, is this true?” East Emperor slowly articulated his question.

Several hundreds of universe masters and universe supreme masters respectfully replied in unison, “Yes.”

The news had only reached them a short while ago. There was no way anything that happened within the holy land universe could be hidden from East Emperor.

“This Duan Dong River Wu’s inheritance is a top-notch inheritance within that powerful ancient civilization!” East Emperor said. “My life… North True Star Master, you shall personally lead a team of 20 universe masters, 200 universe knights, and 2,000 undying fighters and head for that Universe Boat at the fastest speed possible. Send every member of the team in to fight for that inheritance.”

“Yes,” a man in a white robe immediately replied with deference.

North True Star Master was an extremely ancient being, and he was a universe supreme master… Of course, his status of a universe supreme master had been attained as early as when he was in the primal universe era. He existed in the same era as East Emperor. Yet his miniature universe had fallen into a state of decadence a long time ago, so he was based in the holy land universe for daily life.

“Are there any volunteers?” East Emperor looked down. “The inheritance can only have one heir. The rest who fail to be the chosen one will be at risk of annihilation.”

“I’m willing.”

“Willing.”

“I’m willing to go.”

“Willing.”

Almost instantaneously, from the sea of great beings kneeling on the ground, a large number of universe knights and undying godly spirits volunteered. As for the universe masters in midair, a dozen of them shouted out their willingness. Their number was much smaller because they were, after all, a minority group within the holy land universe.

“Let’s leave it to the Elders to discuss and finalize a detailed list of names.” East Emperor looked down and slowly added, “We must finalize the list as fast as we can, so that we can head for the Universe Boat as quickly as possible! With a force of 20 universe masters, 200 universe knights, and 2000 undying fighters, we are going for that Duan Dong River’s inheritance. My East Emperor universe must obtain that inheritance. I… need that inheritance!”

“Yes!” all said in unison, in one voice filled with excitement.

East Emperor needed it? This instantly drove the countless great beings beneath him into a feverish state of enthusiasm.

******

It was merely a short moment, just enough for a cup of tea. North True Star Master was on board a dazzling, polygonal black sphere and was advancing at high speed within the Universe Ocean.

“I have not set foot in Universe Ocean for a good dozen reincarnation eras. Since I am making my appearance now, I shall make sure that I seize this inheritance for East Emperor Universe.”

******

On the same day.

When the news reached Purple Moon Holy Land Universe, the equally mysterious Purple Moon Ancestor also made an appearance at long last, he too, gave orders to his clan to necessitate the need to obtain that Duan Dong River’s inheritance.

“Understood.”

“Understood, Ancestor.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“This inheritance must belong to us, the Purple Moon Holy Land. Deer Bug Master is already there. We have the greatest advantage.”

“Let’s go!”

“According to Ancestor’s order, 1,500 undying fighters, 150 knights, and 15 universe masters shall rush over as fast as possible. Universe supreme masters will be able to rush over there quickly, as their speeds are naturally extremely fast.”

******

The two holy land universes of the Divine Eye Clan were very similar in strength of power. When compared with one another, the result was all the crazier.

The avatars of the Seven True Masters gathered.

“This is our only chance.”

“Doomsday is nearing.”

“We must seize this Duan Dong River’s inheritance. The previous complete inheritance that we have obtained, when compared to Duan Dong River’s… Obviously, there is a vast difference in status! And from what Shadow Dust and Sorcerer Sprite reported, even after Duan Dong River’s annihilation, the methods he had put into motion after all these years to seek an heir were intimidating and frightening. We can tell a thing or two about how powerful his inheritance will be.”

“I suspect that the inheritance is not restricted to only universe masters. It is likely that even universe knights and universe supreme masters can be potential heirs.”

The avatars of the Seven True Masters gathered in the void space to discuss with one another.

“I’m willing to go,” Seventh True Master spoke up. “Even if I were to meet with any danger, I have my palace supreme true treasure! Besides, I am a universe supreme master… I don’t believe that the Duan Dong River who was annihilated endless reincarnation eras ago is able to leave behind a method so deadly that it can kill me.”

“I will go with Seventh.” First True Master nodded slowly.

Instantly, there was an uproar.

“First True Master.”

“Teacher!”

“First True Master, how can you be the one going? If all of us should fail, the mission of transcending a reincarnation era has to depend on you.”

“Divine Eye, do not be so reckless.”

First True Master was the most powerful great being of the entire Divine Eye Clan. If he were to take the risk and be annihilated in the process, the clan would be in deep trouble.

“Speaking of power, I am one notch lower than Ancestor. Even if I were to compare with Huge Axe Creator, I might, at most, be on par.” First True Master sighed. “But to achieve a breakthrough of a reincarnation era… For countless reincarnation eras, only the Ancestors of the two holy land universes were able to succeed! I cannot even surpass Ancestor, nor Huge Axe Creator. Who am I to even think I can succeed in transcending a reincarnation era? It’s just too difficult! This time around, I’m afraid it would be our Divine Eye Clan’s very last chance.”

“Regardless, Divine Eye, you cannot be so reckless. I will go with Seventh. We just need to deploy more universe masters and universe knights!”

“Yes, Second and Seventh. We shall place all hopes on you both.”

Soon, all arrangements were properly in place.

The Divine Eye Clan had sent Second True Master and Seventh True Master, and with them, they lead a team of 20 universe masters and 100 universe knights in their quest for the inheritance, headed for the Universe Boat… To the Divine Eye Clan, this had become a desperate fight arising from jealousy over whose clan was more superior.

******

Groups of powers were indeed going crazy for the inheritance, especially the first reincarnation era, as they were originally in the face of impending doomsday. The second reincarnation era and primal universe were also coveting it… This was probably what the line “a man who does not have foresight will find worry right at his doorstep” meant. This so-called Duan Dong River’s inheritance, if they were to miss it this time, would likely not reappear again for at least the next few reincarnation eras.

If the various groups of powers knew that the Ancestors of the two holy land universes had made appearances just to give orders for this inheritance, it would probably drive nearly 100 groups of powers from the three great reincarnation eras into an even higher state of fervor.
