Chapter 1269: Kill Peng Gong

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The 12 universe masters from the demons who were just filled with fighting spirit and confidence were instantly dealt repeated heavy blows. The lofty Black Pyramid that was suspended high up in the air unleashed bouts of black ripples that unfolded and dispersed toward them, and these black ripples easily penetrated through their armor and reached within their godly bodies to start exerting influence over their souls.

“What is happening? It seems like… No more. No more strength.”

“Willpower… I cannot focus my willpower.”

Prohibition Master and the rest of the demon universe masters knew they were in trouble. This technique of “Sinking into the Darkness” was a move meant for attacking a group, but because it was attacking all 12 of them at the same time, it could not cause them to sink completely. Yet with their entire bodies feeling void of strength and their willpower unable to focus, even if they were to consume their godly powers and battle on with gritted teeth, the power they could release seemed to be only half of what they actually exerted!

“No fighting spirit!”

“Willpower is under the influence.”

“In such a terrible form.”

They were all feeling awful when an endless golden light and snow-white grains of sand floating about started to appear within a region of ten light years around them. If Sinking into the Darkness was influencing their willpower and souls on the surface, causing them to fall under an extremely great influence, then this combination of Golden Kingdom and Snow Sand Ocean would be a material attack that placed a gigantic restraint over them! It was as though countless ropes were encircling the universe masters, binding every single one of them.

“It’s a domain!”

“That’s Luo Feng’s domain! Why does he still have his silver wings?”

“I thought his silver wings got lost when he was in the Ninth Deep Abyss. How is it possible that now—?”

Luo Feng’s wings were still around, yet, the domains of these universe masters were easily oppressed and crushed; within this region of ten light years, everything fell under the influence of the countless icy cold, snow-white grains of sand floating in the golden light. Under this restraint, their powers were further reduced.

Sinking into the Darkness and Restraining the Domain were two moves that suppressed the average power released by the 12 universe masters to only 30 percent of their battle power! Among them, although Prohibition Master’s willpower had reached the level of a universe supreme master—where the influence over him was smaller—he could, at most, unleash 60 to 70 percent of his power. As for the others who were weaker, like Sky Wolf Master, the power they could release was left with only 10 to 20 percent.

“Peng Gong Master and Darkness Master, your troops will jointly attack those 12 universe masters.” Luo Feng performed a voice transmission instantly through his domain. “Leave Dream Demon Ancestor to my troop!”

“All right.”

“All right.”

Peng Gong Master and Darkness Master responded right away.

Luo Feng stood at the front deck of the gigantic Boat of Mausoleum and dashed toward the 12 demon universe masters without further ado. Dream Demon Ancestor was growling and roaring as it swung its body against Black Prison Tower in its attempt to stop Darkness Master from using the move Sinking into the Darkness, but at that very moment…

“Luo Feng!” Dream Demon Ancestor’s huge snake’s head looked at the fast-moving Boat of Mausoleum and knew the situation was bad. The 12 universe masters from its clan were already under extremely strong influence. If even it was being laid siege by Luo Feng, Peng Gong Master, and their troops, would that not mean they were finished?

“Get lost!”

It had a mighty, massive body, and because it was so humongous, it could easily attack Black Tower Prison, Peng Gong Master, and the Boat of Mausoleum. With a single wave of its tail, it swung and whipped the Boat of Mausoleum.

“Come on!” Standing on the deck of the Boat, Luo Feng’s eyes lit up. Where it was originally charging toward the 12 universe masters, the Boat of Mausoleum suddenly changed course in another direction.

Hong!

The Boat of Mausoleum suddenly started to expand from 100 billion kilometers to a trillion kilometers. In an instant, it had expanded to a size that was comparable to Dream Ancestor’s. Previously, in Flame Ice Region, when the five true masters of the Divine Eye Clan utilized their supreme true treasures to form the attack technique “Eternal True God,” Luo Feng also expanded the Boat of Mausoleum quickly and used it to defeat Eternal True God.

This Boat of Mausoleum was an automaton treasure from the ancient civilization. In terms of dynamism and dominance, it was a notch stronger than normal supreme true treasures.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

A gigantic vessel and a large silver snake—both were around the size of one light year. Two massive creatures were colliding against one another amidst the silent, starlit sky.

“Roar!”

Dream Demon Ancestor yelled, but she was quick to realize that pitting strength against the Boat of Mausoleum was pure stupidity. The speed of the Boat of Mausoleum was not the least bit affected, whereas her massive silver snake body was sent flying into the distance, belly up.

Dream Demon Ancestor suddenly let out a furious shout. “Luo Feng!”

When the Boat of Mausoleum was expanding, Luo Feng had suddenly vanished and charged toward the 12 demon universe masters in the distance! With a huge pair of silver wings outspread, like a dazzling, sharp blade screaming through the air, he charged toward the 12 universe masters with murderous intention.

******

Luo Feng had originally planned to make use of the Boat of Mausoleum to deal with Dream Demon Ancestor. However, he saw that Dream Demon Ancestor had no plans to shrink into a smaller body. Instead, she seemed prepared to confront him head-on with that massive body as her way of resistance, so Luo Feng simply changed plans and charged toward the other 12 universe masters, leaving only an avatar of himself that was sustained by his godly power to control and navigate the Boat of Mausoleum.

The Boat of Mausoleum was an automaton vessel, so it was very easy to control. Duan Dong River had died long ago, so now, a mere virtual consciousness was able to control the Boat of Mausoleum. Furthermore, Luo Feng only needed to use part of his godly power to control it. Even so, the power that it unleashed was certainly not to be underestimated.

******

12 demon universe masters were instantly overcome with desperation. Sinking into the Darkness and Restraining the Domain!

Peng Gong Master, Luo Feng, and Darkness Master were charging toward them in the open. Yet who knew when the other human universe masters laying ambush in the dark would take action while the three were dealing blows to them? The opponents had supreme true treasures, and that Black Prison Tower, in particular, could keep them sealed and suppression.

“Quickly! Take cover in here!”

“Into the boat.”

The 12 demon universe masters did not dare to make any reckless moves. Immediately, all of them hid in the huge vessel.

“Ancestor!”

“Ancestor!”

“Ancestor!”

All 12 universe masters immediately pleaded for help. If they were up against the humans one-to-one, they were certainly not weaker in comparison. Who would have expected the humans to have a supreme true treasure? This put them in a disadvantageous position, which had resulted in them being placed at the losing end right at the very beginning.

“Roar!” From afar, Dream Demon Ancestor—who had been on the losing end from the start, pitted against the Boat of Mausoleum, raised its snake’s head and screamed out in rage. It was clear that being caught in a fight with the Boat of Mausoleum was a silly move, so merely after a single exchange of blows, it reluctantly changed its strategy and shrank its godly body speedily!

From as large as one light year, it rapidly transformed into a silver snake that was 10,000 kilometers long. Previously, it had taken up such a large form because it thought it would give it an edge over its opponent—that its massive size could suppress the entire troop of great beings from the human race! Then it could get the 12 universe masters from its clan to join forces and sweep out the entire human troop.

But reality mocked it; its opponents had the Boat of Mausoleum and Black Prison Tower, which were two supreme true treasures palaces, so there was no way it could counterattack. Therefore, its initial plans added up to failure.

Sou!

After it had transformed into a silver snake merely 10,000 kilometers long, Dream Demon Ancestor’s speed quickly soared at such a rate that it instantly surpassed the limit of the speed of light. It moved so fast that the naked eye could not see it. Only by probing around the domain with one’s godly power could there be any hope of detecting Dream Demon Ancestor, who was moving at such a terrifying speed.

“This is what we call a universe supreme master!”

Luo Feng, Peng Gong Master, and Darkness Master were all sighing in their hearts. Prior to the battle, they had devised strategic plans because they did not feel that dealing with the demons would be easy. Just a Dream Demon Ancestor in its shrunken form, with its ability to surpass the speed of light and travel at such an unrestrained speed, it would be unstoppable. There would be no way they could restrain it. It could arrive at any critical spot on the battlefield immediately as it pleased.

“Get lost!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The silver snake let out a roar and immediately crashed into the Black Prison Tower.

Hong! Long!

Black Prison Tower reeled backward as it was thrown off its track.

“It’s too fast.” Luo Feng and Peng Gong Master looked at one another.

******

After the silver snake crashed right into Black Prison Tower, it stopped, suspended in midair. The 12 universe masters who were hiding within the gigantic vessel flew over and landed on the neck of Dream Demon Ancestor. All their godly bodies were maintained at a size of around 10,000 kilometers.

“Humans!” Dream Demon Ancestor’s icy gaze swept the surroundings. “I have underestimated you all.”

“However, without any universe supreme master, the control rights of this fight lies with me! Now… I have decided that I shall deal with you all slowly, one after the other.” Dream Demon Ancestor’s gaze swept the humans and stopped at Peng Gong Master. “First on the list will be you!”

Hua!

Dream Demon Ancestor moved instantly. Its speed was so fast that it was terrifying.

Peng Gong Master, on the other hand, let out an angry growl. He was holding onto Yan Jun Rod, which suddenly expanded as large as a million kilometers. Then it mightily swept outward—all at once, time and space shattered to shards as Yan Jun Rod, and Dream Demon Ancestor’s tail crashed into one another. Dream Demon Ancestor was hit so hard that it was sent flying backward. Likewise, Peng Gong Master was forced to retreat a short distance.

“If this was Universe Ocean, do you think you would be my match?” Dream Demon Ancestor roared in rage “Full force attack!”

“Yes, Ancestor.”

“Yes.”

“Meet your doom, Peng Gong.”

“Meet your doom!”

The handful of demon universe masters on the neck of its godly body attacked at the same time. At that moment, be it a far-range spiritual weapon attack, an enlarged blade hacking from afar, a soul-enforced attack, or an illusion attack, everything was thrown over at the same time, targeting Peng Gong Master in the distance.

“Sinking into the Darkness!” Black Prison Tower flew over and once again, it unleashed endless black ripples and tried to exert its influence over the 12 universe masters.

“Suppress!” Luo Feng commanded in a low voice.

Golden Kingdom and Snow Sand Ocean exerted their influence to suppress at the same time.

“Breaking free from everything!” Dream Demon Ancestor roared.

Instantly, all its godly power surged. At that moment, the surrounding time and space trembled and eventually became contorted. Its strong godly power was trembling. Time and again, it was hit by impacts, yet it could still turn the tables on the incoming force from Golden Kingdom and Snow Sand Ocean and force its suppression over them instead. Even the black ripples from Black Tower Prison had all been completely suppressed by it.

The 12 universe masters were not the least bit affected.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

At the same time, all their attacks were directed at Peng Gong Master, who was trying his best to ward off the various hits with his Yan Jun Rod to no avail; his wits had been beaten out of him. After all, when the 12 universe masters joined forces without being under any influence, the strength they released was truly more terrifying than what a universe supreme master was capable of!

“Hahaha… You—you are the first to be annihilated!” Dream Demon Ancestor yelled as its speed soared at a terrifying rate. Right away, it charged toward Peng Gong Master.

It was Dream Demon Ancestor! And the 12 demon universe masters under its command were all joining forces!

Even if Peng Gong Master had Yan Jun rod… there was no escape from being sealed and suppressed!
