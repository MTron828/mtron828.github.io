“Haha. I’ve succeeded, I’ve succeeded.”

Virtual universe, Absolute beginning villa 1136. Luo Feng was in his own training grounds, as he was studying, using the floating blood and time space scribbles to work on the 9 universe tablet Drizzle picture. He was finally able to comprehend the 12th wonder.

The 1st to 9th, belonged to the most superficial, he had comprehended them back in primal chaos city.

As for the 10th and 11th, he had made some progress after studying the time space scribbles, along with some accumulated knowledge from what he saw in primal chaos city, it finally came to fruition. And then, he had been stumped for quite awhile by the 12th wonder. After two years of training in this ancient huge pit, he finally comprehended it.

“It really is difficult. My consciousness’s calculation speed is comparable to a basic quantum computer, and my comprehension ability is high too. Yet, it actually took me this long to comprehend the 12th wonder.” Luo Feng sighed. “There are the 1st 9, the middle 27 and the final 72. From the middle 27, I’ve only comprehended 3 so far. When will I finish everything?”

He muttered, within however he was gleeful.

To dissect and study the essence of the universe space laws, would it be that easy? Only those with exceptional comprehension, temperament and talent could do it. Even the genius Lian Luo only comprehended it after 3000 years in primal chaos city. Of course, the main usage of time was on the final and hardest 72.

“Hm!”

“Two years, I’ve been in this ancient pit training for two years, and my earth body has been evolving from the absorption of the killing aura everyday. Compared to before, my improvement should be quite huge. Three months ago I still failed at the absorption of the 2nd crystal, now that it’s been three months…I may succeed!” Feeling especially good, Luo Feng decided…

Today, he would try and absorb the blood river crystal again!

Shua!

His consciousness vanished and returned to reality.

Blood river continent, within a huge pit of the ancient god ruins.

Within the Huge pit quarters.

The Mosha clansman was sitting crossed legged, his earth body was in the internal world, as he couldn’t control his body during the absorption, it was best to do it in the internal world.

……

Internal world. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Luo Feng only had on his underpants, as he was lying at the bottom of a tall metal mountain, holding the blood river crystal in his right hand.

“Chi!” He used his right finger to slash his left palm, creating a wound, fresh blood flowed out.

“Begin!”

Luo Feng once again placed the crystal on the wound. This was already the 5th time he was trying to absorb the 2nd crystal. He had failed the previous 4 times. Following that mad killing intent that rushed in and attacked his soul, the familiar feeling once again settled in, his body’s every bone and cell all began to swiftly change.

“I have to bear with it!”

“I definitely have to bear with it, don’t collapse.” Luo Feng anticipated within. Even though the terrifying pain reached to the depths of his soul, he could bear with all these.

The blood red threads from the crystal continued to flow into Luo Feng’s body. Gradually, the crystal grew more and more transparent.

Luo Feng’s weird body changes gradually grew more intense too.

“Chi!”

The entire crystal including the already transparent crystal body became a peculiar energy and rushed straight into Luo Feng’s body. Suddenly, the originally simple blood red engraving on his chest had more marks added onto it, the entire engraving now wasn’t as simple as before.

Hu!

His entire body returned back to normal as the blood red engraving vanished and that mysterious energy permeated into his body’s every cell.

Sou! Luo Feng swiftly got up.

“I’ve succeeded, really succeeded.” Luo Feng’s eyes had a sense of mad glee. In the previous four attempts, every single time, it was incredibly painful. But the pain wasn’t the problem, the main problem was that he had failed every time. He didn’t expect that he would be able to succeed today.

“The feeling of absorbing two crystals.”

With a thought, Luo Feng triggered the mysterious energy deep within his body. Immediately the blood red engraving appeared on his chest, Luo Feng revealed a look of glee. “Feels different, obviously different. My feeling for the 9 great origin laws of the universe are much clearer now too.”

Hu!

His hand became a blade and he began to unleash the illusionary 7 blades. When he did this, he was even more pleasantly surprised.

“Melding with the universe energies, it’s caused the power to rise up quite a bit.” Luo Feng was surprised within. “Absorbing the 1st crystal raised my power by 20 30%. Right now it has been raised by another 20 30%. Which means…because of the two crystals, at the same level of comprehension, my power has been raised by 50%!”

In a life or death battle, with 50% more power, he would be able to completely determined his own fate. Also, as one grew closer to his limit, the harder it was to increase.

The golden horned beast’s natural ability to strengthen, could only at most double the power, and it was already godly.

The training for Deities of the world was extremely harsh only because the effects were godly.

“Let me try and see if I can absorb the 3rd crystal.” Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed.

Even though his hopes weren’t up, he wanted to try.

As he tried to absorb the 3rd crystal, that killing intent from the crystal combined with the two years worth of killing intent stored in his body, formed a terrifying killing aura that attacked him. However, just from his willpower alone, Luo Feng could still take it! He was accustomed to it, as he had been living in a dense killing aura area for two years.

Always bearing with the effects of the killing intent, Luo feng’s mental state was more sturdy and trained now.

The willpower attacks were easily blocked by Luo Feng. The 3rd crystal then began to extend its red threads into the wound, and started flowing into Luo Feng.

“Peng!” “Peng!” “Peng!”

12 different spots around Luo Feng’s body exploded simultaneously, almost like a bamboo that had long reached its limit. Any extra pressure caused it to instantly tear open. One theory was that after absorbing the 2nd crystal, Luo Feng had already reached a limit, and now that he was trying the 3rd, his body couldn’t take it anymore.

One had to know that the further it went, the harsher the requirements on the body would be. In fact, the harshness was 10 times more each time!

“Damn!” Looking at the recovered crystal in his palm, Luo Feng could only helplessly swiftly recover his body.

“It’s ok. I’m already very satisfied with absorbing the 2nd crystal. After I work hard in this place, I can absorb the crystals and train my willpower, I definitely have to stay on.” Luo Feng smiled. Normal dangerous level missions only gave 10k to 20k points, completing a few dangerous level missions would only gather so much.

As long as he became a blood warrior and acquire the blood river medal, he would receive 100k points.

What’s more, absorbing three crystals was good for his body too.

Absolute beginning region.

Wuka’s villa. Normally, Luo Feng, Wuka and Rong Jun would all meet here at wuka’s quarters.

“Wa, Luo Feng, you training madman. The moment I called you today you came. That’s shocking.” Wuka lay satisfied on his sofa, leg on the table before him.

“If the things a madman does don’t surprise you, then he wouldn’t be a madman anymore.” Luo Feng laughed and lied down on the sofa too. “Wuka, bring out your best wine. I rarely come, and since I am here, you have to show the demeanor of an owner.”

“The wine in the virtual universe still cost money!” Wuka stood up helplessly.

As the virtual universe was a business just like reality, hence the food and beverage dependant Ping Hai company could earn so much.

Beside, Rong Jun laughed too. “Money? Wuka, our great Manka prince, what is this little money to our dear majesty, does it even mean anything?”

“Damn, you two punks. Back then, one of you were a madman and another a savage. Only I was an innocent youth…who would’ve thought it’d take me so long to see through you two, that you are both vicious and cunning.” Wuka said. He took out a bright jade bottle that was placed beside him, and within it was a transparent glowing liquid that made one completely tremble at the flavor.

“Hehe.” Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed.

“Wa, Wuka is definitely a brother.” Rong Jun laughed too.

“Hmph, this is God Drunk, even though it’s within the virtual universe, when you drink it it’s completely similar to drinking in reality. However the God Drunk in reality, just 1 bottle costs 8000 mixed elements. And here, I only spent 8 mixed elements.” Wuka was obviously proud as he said this.

Luo Feng shouted, “To buy one life fruit two mixed elements is enough. This wine sure is so luxurious, stop showing off.”

“Hurry and bring it, I’m already drooling.” Rong Jun stood up to try and snatch it.

“Don’t rush, I’m coming.” Wuka sat down and poured for the wine for three of them.

Even though it was called God Drunk, it didn’t knock one out completely, but produced an incredibly feeling within one’s consciousness, one that worked completely on the spirit.

“Good wine.” Luo Feng closed his eyes.

“Nice.” Rong Jun opened his eyes after tasting and snatched the bottle. “I’ll pour.”

“When you get one in real life, be a little luxurious.” Wuka muttered.

“You Majesty is vicious.” Luo Feng laughed.

“We have no money.” Rong Jun said.

Wuka looked at Rong Jun, “Rong Jun, it’s been two years. You’ve done so many missions. Just from these missions alone, you should have tens of thousands of points! Tens of thousands…exchanging for a real God Drunk in reality shouldn’t be a problem. If you are willing, even the undyings would be willing to exchange with you.”

“Right, Luo Feng.” Wuka looked at him. “Are you still stuck in that mission? I don’t mean to nag, but wasting time is wasting strength. who isn’t grasping their time now and training hard. If you cannot complete it, just give up and take another mission.”

“How can he give up? Every 100 years, you can only take 10 such missions. Hence, you cannot give up any one of them.” Rong Jun emphasized.

“Every 100 years, you can only take 10 such missions?” Luo Feng looked at Rong Jun, “Where’d you get that from?”

“Hm, I just received my 5th mission and got the notice, telling me that every 100 years, we can only take 10 missions. It is to prevent the core members from trying too hard to get points and wasting time on the missions. Afterall, training and missions, along with studying and comprehension are all very important.” Rong Jun explained.

Luo Feng nodded.

“No matter. Madman, being stuck in 1 mission isn’t good.” Wuka said.

“Hm, Wuka is right.” Rong Jun nodded.

Luo Feng couldn’t help but laugh. “You two punks. What, you think I’m wasting my time there? And my strength isn’t improving enough. Haha…today I’ll go attempt the heavenly bridge and let you see.”

“Heavenly bridge?” Rong Jun and Wuka were both shocked as they looked at him. “6th level?”
