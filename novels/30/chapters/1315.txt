Chapter 1317: Luo Feng’s Path to Universe Supreme Master

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng speculated that even though the mind of the original universe was beyond all the conflicts, it would still be angered if a great being did something wrong! And it wanted to kill those great beings!

However, even if it wanted to kill someone, it couldn’t do it by itself. It was obvious that it needed great beings’ help to kill Yuan Ao Master and the three conniving universe supreme masters. It meant that even the original mind, which was invincible and superior, needed to follow some rules!

Even Teacher Origin, who went against the original mind, was only eternally suppressed by the original mind, Luo Feng thought. Other than that, I haven’t heard that the original mind wanted anyone dead. It’ runs on pure instinct.

After contemplation, Luo Feng was far less intimidated by the original mind.

“My job is to tell you what happened!” said Double-Face Ancestral God with a smile. “I’m just here to tell you who conspired and led to the death of Huge Axe Creator. You humans can decide what to do. We can’t force you to do anything.”

Secretly, Luo Feng sneered. It wasn’t because the ancestral gods couldn’t force them, as even the original mind couldn’t force the humans! However, the humans couldn’t overlook such hostility—even if they couldn’t quickly avenge Huge Axe Creator.

“Thank you, Double-Face Ancestral God,” said Luo Feng. “It’s indeed important to us humans. I’ll show myself out.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Luo Feng got up, intending to leave. Double-Face Ancestral God stood up and showed Luo Feng out. Luo Feng then went back to his place and left through god country transportation.

In the primal secret region of the human territory.

Hong! Long! Long!

The tumbling waves of Remote Ocean surged. Some of the waves were a million kilometers tall.

After the fight hundreds of years ago, Luo Feng had left his Remote Ocean here. There was a pinnacle soul true treasure hidden in Remote Ocean. Its godly power with Duan Mie and the pinnacle soul true treasure could resist any attacks under level ten.

The humans had captured more than 200 universe masters last time, significantly weakening the united forces alliance.

Even if the united forces used all their power to attack again, it could barely reach level nine. Besides, after getting the inheritance from Purple Moon Ancestor, the Freedom Alliance didn’t have any motivation anymore, and they had lost half their universe masters. They wouldn’t have any benefits, and it would be dangerous for them to get in a fight. How could they agree to fight their friends?

That was why the united forces alliance could only use around 400 universe masters. It wasn’t a threat!

“Teacher!” Luo Feng stepped on the space and flew to the highest level of the towering main palace. Primal Chaos City Leader was leaning against the handrail and looking to Luo Feng.

“Are you practicing? Why are you here?” Primal Chaos City Leader smiled.

“Double-Face Ancestral God just talked to me,” said Luo Feng. “The original mind told him to give me some important information, so I had to come here and see you.”

“The original mind told the ancestral gods to give you information? That original mind…” Primal Chaos City Leader was shocked. “What kind of information?”

“Double-Face Ancestral God told me that three beings conspired to kill Huge Axe Creator,” said Luo Feng.

Primal Chaos City Leader was shocked. His godly body shook. “Who?”

“From the first universe era,” said Luo Feng. “Great Thunder Star Master, Zhen Jia Emperor, and Dragon Rock Ancestral God!”

Primal Chaos City Leader’s lips quivered. He was whispering the names. He clenched his fist, twisting the space and time around him, and his eyes glinted fiercely. Belligerence, hatred, and an urge to kill all rushed through his mind. Compared to Luo Feng, he had been far much more devastated by Huge Axe’s death.

Luo Feng was grateful that Huge Axe had helped him before, but they were not close, as they hadn’t talked with each other much. As for Primal Chaos City Leader, it was different… Both he and Huge Axe had followed Teacher Origin, and Huge Axe was like a brother to him. After Teacher Origin was suppressed, the burden of the humans had fallen on Huge Axe and Primal Chaos City Leader. They were closer than brothers! Teacher Origin and Huge Axe had been closer to Primal Chaos City Leader than anyone else in the human race; Teacher Origin had been like a father, while Huge Axe had been like a big brother!

“Great Thunder Star Master! Zhen Jia Emperor! Dragon Rock Ancestral God! They all deserve to die!” Primal Chaos City Leader spat the words out of his mouth.

“Teacher…” Luo Feng realized his teacher’s mood was out of control.

“I’m okay.” Primal Chaos City Leader suppressed his desire to kill. “Relax. I know these three universe supreme masters are more difficult to deal with than those in the original universe. Huge Axe Creator chose not to name them because he didn’t want us to suffer losses. However, we’ll avenge Huge Axe one way or another! Just not now.”

Luo Feng nodded.

Primal Chaos City Leader closed his eyes. It seemed that he had successfully suppressed his emotions. He then opened his eyes and started another topic. “Luo Feng, you’ve been practicing for hundreds of years, so I didn’t bother you, but I need to tell you what happened in the past few hundred years.”

“Please do, Teacher,” said Luo Feng.

“The Hong Alliance has better policies now,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “There are greater benefits from joining the Hong Alliance, and those who betray the Hong Alliance will be heavily punished. The unity of the Hong Alliance is growing stronger, and even 12 universe masters from the Freedom Alliance joined the Hong Alliance.”

Luo Feng looked pleased.

It was true. Anyone with eyes could see that the unity on the human team was better, yet the united forces formed only a loose alliance. The humans had greater potential, and with the attraction of more benefits, it was natural that universe masters opted to join.

“Besides, Purple Moon Holy Land offered the inheritance to the Freedom Alliance and the united forces alliance,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “It’s widely spread! Some of the universe masters in the Hong Alliance are from the race with those in Freedom Alliance. Some universe masters from the Freedom Alliance share the inheritance with those from the same race, and they share it with us.”

Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed.

“Which means we get the inheritance from the Purple Moon Holy Land, too,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Actually, Purple Moon Holy Land was already prepared for us to know the inheritance.”

“How is the inheritance?” asked Luo Feng.

“It’s very detailed and comprehensive,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “It’s indeed ten times better than the information we prepared for the other races. Of course, it’s nothing compared to yours.”

Luo Feng nodded. The inheritance he had obtained was incredibly detailed—from machine type to valuable-making stream to other streams. The memory stones from Duan Dong River contained incredible information, yet Luo Feng had only extracted a little bit providing the other races with a simplified version. It was nothing compared to what the humans had.

“Based on what Purple Moon Holy Land provided, we can give a bit more to lure the other races,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “It’s very unlikely for someone to become a universe supreme master from a universe master, so it’s okay to give them the information. Besides, with time going by, and with the systematic training provided to humans, there will be a great number of universe knights and even universe masters. Humans will soon grow stronger and stronger, and there will be more beings as powerful as Teacher Origin, or beings who can transcend incarnation! Our status will be very stable.”

Luo Feng nodded. If the humans were advancing quickly, they needed to help out their subsidiaries as well. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be loyal to the humans.

“By the way, how was the practicing in the past several centuries?” asked Primal Chaos City Leader.

“It’s going great.” Luo Feng couldn’t help expressing his joy.

Primal Chaos City Leader nodded with satisfaction. He knew that this disciple of his was always sensational when he truly showed his power, although he normally remained low-key. If he said it was “going great,” it meant he had gained a lot.

“Do you have a plan to become a universe supreme master?” asked Primal Chaos City Leader.

“Yes, but it’s very difficult!” Luo Feng exclaimed.

Of course, he had a plan. Regarding law comprehension and techniques, he was already at the pinnacle of universe masters. After all, it was already incredible for universe masters to be able to create merged supreme techniques, yet Luo Feng created a universe-supreme-master-level technique, “Nirvana Incarnation,” and he had perfect godly power… He was able to break into a universe supreme master!

However, this was beyond difficult! In the past few hundred years (hundreds of eras in the space of inheritance), his greatest accomplishment had been understanding Star Tower better!

Luo Feng was full of joy every time he thought of Star Tower. It was, after all, the most mysterious true treasure he possessed and had proven incredible beyond his expectations! When he was still weak, he hadn’t found it to be special. But after getting stronger—especially after the war hundreds of years ago—he had found a highlight of Star Tower. After hundreds of eras of comprehension, he had discovered that the highlight was only a small part of Star Tower! It was an exceptional and extraordinary true treasure. The stronger his power grew, the more he learned of its functions.

“It’s remarkable. It’s much more precious than Shi Wu Wing. Based on the broken memories, Shi Wu Wing was used by a being much mightier than true gods! As for Star Tower, it was already enough to beings at that level. How did teacher Sitting Mountain Guest create a true treasure at that level?”

Luo Feng found it hard to believe. In his opinion, universe supreme masters (true gods) wouldn’t be able to create Star Tower.

Teacher once said something unexpected happened when he was making it, Luo Feng thought. Is it because of that? Besides… Teacher created the Flame God race, but they failed him, so he later created the earthlings… What does teacher Sitting Mountain Guest want?”

Luo Feng felt that everything about Teacher Sitting Mountain Guest was mysterious! Nine Volume Manual was exceptional, and Sitting Mountain Guest was the only one known to be able to create a manual like that.

For what it’s worth, I owe teacher Sitting Mountain Guest big time. If he needs my help, I’ll do everything I can to help him! Luo Feng thought. I’m already powerful enough, and there’s nothing to be afraid of. I’ll wait until the day Teacher Sitting Mountain Guest comes to ask me for help.

After several eras of practicing, he understood much more about Star Tower, and he was also pondering how to become a universe supreme master!

He had four bodies now. If he followed the normal route of law evolution, his god country would become a miniature universe while all the bodies would be combined into one. After combining into the original earthling body, 99 percent of the godly power in Remote Ocean would return back to the original universe. Luo Feng couldn’t allow that to happen. Fortunately, he had the inheritance from Duan Dong River, so he knew exactly what he should do to avoid it!

I can only follow another path—a more difficult path, and a path to be more powerful, thought Luo Feng. I will start with my godly body and break the laws with my strength, after which I’ll become a true god! Only by doing that can my godly body absorb all the godly power, holding it in my endless Remote Ocean.
