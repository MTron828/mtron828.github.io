Chapter 1242: Luo Feng’s Blade Technique

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng comprehended assiduously. Up against the three ice mountains, any great being would pale in comparison. And those beautiful law engravings that resembled meteor-like rays embodied the final, true secrets. Just looking at them was a kind of enjoyment, and they enabled Luo Feng’s understanding of blades to consistently increase by leaps and bounds.

Immersed in the process of comprehending, Luo Feng hardly noticed half a year go by. Although it was said to be half a year, his Remote Ocean body was comprehending within a miniature universe, which therefore brought the interval up to as long as 5,000 years.

“Combination? Star River Master may be formidable, but his so-called combination of secret technique, ‘River in the Dark,’ is beyond rigid.” Luo Feng gently shook his head. “First, it is similar to a miniature universe—a secret technique used to complement attacks. Although the combination was quite well done, the intention of forming this combination seems to arise from the need for a shortcut. This is the one true path we need to take if we want to come up with a combination of the strongest secret technique.”

A blade suddenly appeared in Luo Feng’s hands. It was Absolute Guest; since he had gained Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor, the strongest battle technique he wielded was naturally Extermination God, so Absolute Guest was seldom used.

“Foggy Light,” Luo Feng whispered. “I achieved a breakthrough for this technique and have brought it to the state of a strongest secret technique, so now, I shall use Foggy Light… to create a combination.”

Because he was a high achiever in the studies of diagrams of secret engravings, he was able to comprehend quite a few strongest secret techniques while in the Boat of Mausoleum. He did likewise for Foggy Light, which was originally an ultimate secret technique of a universe overlord. He improved it to perfection, and thus, it reached the state of a strongest secret technique of a universe master.

Standing above the chaotic airflow and looking far into the distance at the three ice mountains, Luo Feng’s hand, which was holding Absolute Guest blade, suddenly moved.

Hua!

A hazy thread suddenly appeared in midair, left in mid-air by his blade. It was like a dream; it seemed to be filled with the essence of Foggy Light. Shortly after, another appeared. Thread after thread appeared continuously. Instantly, a tremendous number of dreamlike threads—enough to cover the entire space between heaven and earth—appeared in midair. As time passed, the speed at which the threads were being formed quickened, and the power of the threads grew more terrifying as they continued to burst out while gaining strength.

Hong!

Streams of hazy threads resembling fog continued to appear until, finally, they all transformed into a shadow of a blade that seemed to fill up the entire void space. As this blade shadow brushed past, it seemed to clean up the entire void space as though it were a piece of cloth. It wiped away everything. It might have seemed like a simple virtual shadow, but it wielded a power that could make one shudder and tremble.

“The first move… shall be named Foggy Light Void Space.”

Luo Feng laughed lightly. Creating a combination of strongest secret techniques was nothing too difficult for him these days, especially after spending such a long time on cultivation through concurrently studying the Rhinoceros Emperor Game and the secret techniques of the Ninth Deep Abyss. Be it the ability to comprehend or the ability to create secret techniques, he had long been highly accomplished.

If it was merely to create a combination of strongest secret techniques, Luo Feng was capable of going faster. Yet, after learning the secrets the three ice mountains contained and comprehending the 360 blade manuals, Luo Feng was no longer interested in resorting to such substandard, shortcut combinations of strongest secret techniques like River in the Dark. He was more oriented toward using a true combination of ultimate techniques!

The concept of Foggy Light Void Space was achieved by continuously superimposing and overlapping until the perfect limit was met. Then the ultimate power would be released!

That cold, mechanical voice suddenly resounded. “The first move of candidate’s blade technique has been created.”

Luo Feng was shocked and looked up at that star in the dark sky with a slight frown. “Seems like the blade technique I created is still under supervision…”

Whether it was truly his creation or not was, in fact, easy to tell; executing a technique that he created by himself, compared to executing someone else’s creation that he had acquired resulted in differing amounts of power being released.

“My combination of strongest secret techniques has yet to meet the requirements? The expectations must be very high.”

Luo Feng was no longer complacent over his creation, Foggy Light Void Space. He continued to comprehend the three mountains of blades.

******

Time passed, and the more he studied the inheritance of the blade, the more profound Luo Feng felt it was—to the extent that he started to feel dissatisfied with his earlier creation, Foggy Light Void Space. He wanted to create an even stronger blade technique.

******

Within Huge Axe Creator’s miniature universe, Remote Ocean body sat cross-legged with both eyes looking into the void space. A trace of godly power took the form of a fleeting human shadow that was executing moves from the various sets of blade techniques while numerous blade techniques were being created. The diagrams of secret engravings were extremely skilled in the creation of secret techniques to begin with. Even though Luo Feng’s starting achievements in the diagrams of secret engravings were merely at the level of a universe knight, he was still able to create Golden Light, which was an ultimate secret technique of a universe master—albeit by a stroke of luck.

To create secret techniques according to the laws and studying the diagrams of secret engravings to create secret techniques were fundamentally two different methods. Between the two, diagrams of secret engravings were more direct.

At that moment, Luo Feng’s was changing his mind as sets of blade techniques were emerging at an extremely fast rate—so fast that he practically found it unbelievable. This was how impressive the studies of diagrams of secret engravings was.

“Compared to the 360 blade manuals, my blade technique is shabby. The path of the golden space should be much stronger. Should be. Should be…”

Luo Feng felt a vague emotion stirring in his heart. After he spent such a long time comprehending the three mountains of blades, that feeling got even stronger, as though the burning passion in his heart was being suppressed by a layer that seemed impenetrable and impossible to break through. Within him, that feeling remained in deliberation.

As his comprehension of blade techniques deepened and his achievements in the diagrams of secret engravings increased, nearing the limit of a universe master, Luo Feng attained a clearer comprehension of what his next move should be.

In the blink of an eye, nine years had passed. In the land of inheritance, standing on the chaotic airflow, Luo Feng drew Absolute Guest blade from behind.

Clang!

The sound of the blade being wielded was transmitted throughout the void space. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Upon flipping my palms… There will be one universe.”

Luo Feng was silently chanting.

“Rise!”

His blazing godly power was like the vast sky, and with Luo Feng as the core, it spread out to enshroud a part of the void space to form a world of its own. Shortly after, this miniature universe suddenly shrank and collapsed. As it collapsed, it transformed into streams of dazzling golden blade rays. Altogether, 10,081 streams of golden blade rays were densely packed together, complementing one another as they hacked toward the core position. It was like a giant star that had been destroyed, expanding one moment, then shrinking and transforming into a black hole the next. Its power was simply unbelievable.

Luo Feng’s face registered a highly emotional expression as he whispered, “This move has met the limit of the path of the golden space! The evolution of the golden space… 10,081 possibilities, all combined into one move. Only the destruction of the universe will be able to bear the weight of its power—a power so strong that it is even much stronger than the self-destruction of great being. This is a true combination of ultimate techniques. It may even be a notch higher than Five Chaos Master’s ultimate technique, which he created with adherence to the five great combination laws. This move shall be called ‘Golden Universe.'”

Excitement. Sobbing and sighs. Upon creating this move, Luo Feng knew that this move, which he had finally created upon exhausting all the comprehended secrets, was the true limit of the path of the golden space on its use of secret techniques. It was truly the one perfect move he had created.

“The second move of candidate’s blade technique has been created,” announced that cold, mechanical voice.

Luo Feng looked up at that star in the dark sky and waited silently for a moment. Then he frowned.

“Huh? I have already created this move, yet I am still unable to meet Duan Dong River’s expectation? This, this… Even this is not enough to meet Duan Dong River’s expectation? Could it be I must create a secret technique of a universe supreme master before I can meet his expectations?”

Foggy Light Void Space was a stellar combination of ultimate techniques. It was stronger than River in the Dark and probably comparable to Five Chaos Master’s Great Extermination ultimate technique. And Golden Universe was truly a perfect move he created upon exhausting all that he comprehended to meet the limit of the golden space. The way Luo Feng saw it, this was, theoretically, the true ultimate limit that he could reach for a secret technique at the level of a universe supreme master. There was no way he could further surpass it.

If these two moves he had created were still not enough to meet the requirements, there had to be something of a higher level that he had to create.

“Universe supreme master?” Luo Feng was frustrated. “What should I do?”

Becoming a universe supreme master was difficult. All the diagrams of secret engravings did not work out. With respect to the diagrams of secret engravings, Luo Feng’s peak was only at the limit of a universe master. Other paths might also be as such—unless Luo Feng chose to take a whole new path. Maybe then he could possibly achieve a breakthrough and become a universe supreme master.

If he was not a universe supreme master, yet he had to create a secret technique at the level of a universe supreme master, within the whole Universe Ocean, this could be said to be an impossible mission! Without a breakthrough, there was no way he could comprehend the secrets at that level.

Of course, previously, when Luo Feng’s achievement level in the studies of diagrams of secret engravings was only at the level of a universe knight, he had created Golden Light. Theoretically speaking, given his current achievement level in the studies of diagrams of secret engravings—which was near the limit of a universe master—it was possible for him to create a secret technique of a universe supreme master. Especially with the 360 blade manuals for reference and the three mountains of blades as guidance.

Theoretically, it was possible!

Since Duan Dong River had made this arrangement, and with the three mountains of blades as guidance, Luo Feng should be able to create a much stronger move. However, there was no precedence for this in all of Universe Ocean! It was too difficult!

“I will have to take a gamble.” Luo Feng gritted his teeth and decided to brave his way through it all.

In another land of inheritance within the space of inheritance, the handsome Blue Blood Knight looked at the two lofty ice mountains before him; within these ice mountains, there were countless meteor-like light rays dancing everywhere. Even if he could not decipher the secrets they carried, he still found them to be extremely beautiful.

“I have a feeling… a move has reached the ultimate limit of the path of time and space…” Blue Blood Knight mumbled to himself as he sought that feeling.

******

In another land of inheritance, on a chaotic airflow, Deer Bug Master sat cross-legged with brows furrowed in deep thought. Before him was a lofty ice mountain.

“With 36 manuals for reference, these law engravings contain the ultimate secrets…” said Deer Bug Master. “I am a sixth-tiered universe master to begin with. I have very easily created a perfect secret technique that can be said to be at the level of a universe master, and even moved on to creating two kinds of secret techniques in succession of one another. But, I have yet to meet the expected requirements. Could it be I must create a secret technique of a universe supreme master?”

Deer Bug Master was frustrated. He was a sixth-tiered universe master and had lived long enough to know all the secrets required to create secret techniques at the level of a universe master.

It was merely because a holy land universe was unable to breed universe supreme masters. Thus, he could only remain a universe master. Given his current power, if he were to be placed within the primal universe, he could be hopeful of breaking through and becoming a universe supreme master. And his current power was an accumulation of his experience over umpteen reincarnation eras. It was a rich accumulation, and this time around, he even had the help of Purple Moon Ancestor. Certainly, he would be able to achieve something remarkable.

“According to what Ancestor says, the law engravings are the true ultimate power. It is where all the laws are combined. With the help of the law engravings. It is indeed possible to comprehend, despite the difficulty involved. It all depends on one’s ability to comprehend.”

Deer Bug Master was extremely frustrated.

******

At that moment, several aged universe masters, particularly those from East Emperor Holy Land and Purple Moon Holy land—who had already created many combinations of strongest secret techniques—all seemed to be stuck at the same threshold.

It was just that those who passed the second bottleneck had 36 manuals for reference and an ice mountain to view. Those who passed the first bottleneck did not have any manual to start with. Only an ice mountain to view!

Wishing to meet Duan Dong River’s requirements merely based on this simple and basic inheritance was extremely difficult. Yet not a single great being dared to show any hint giving up. They were all trying their best. All of them coveted that slightest trace of a possibility—the trace of a possibility of receiving the core inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River.
