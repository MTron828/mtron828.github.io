Chapter 1449: Enslave

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng had captured Morosa alive this time so that other Sector Beasts wouldn’t be able to kill him. By doing so, he hoped that the ultimate king of Sector Beasts would never be born. Then they would stand a chance of surviving the catastrophe of Sector Beasts this time. However, according to Morosa, it was not going to work, so Luo Feng thought of a different way. He had decided to enslave Morosa.

As long as Morosa became his soul slave, Morosa would trust Luo Feng completely from the bottom of its soul. It would even be willing to die for Luo Feng, and it would tell Luo Feng everything it knew.

Once I enslave it, I might be able to cultivate Morosa into the ultimate king, Luo Feng thought. Perhaps it’s almost impossible to do it, but if it becomes my slave, it’ll devote its entire heart to me. It will tell me everything about the hive of the Sector Beasts. It’ll also tell me the strengths and weaknesses of Sector Beasts. I can only defeat the Sector Beasts after I know all about them.

No matter what, enslaving a Sector Beast would give Luo Feng a much better chance of winning.

Chi!

After the trace of triangular light was absorbed by the body of Morosa, it said something in a mild voice, and then Luo Feng wasn’t able to sense it anymore.

“I failed?” Luo Feng frowned.

“Hahaha…” Both of the two heads of Morosa were guffawing, and it looked scornful. “Milky Way Horde Leader, you’re too arrogant. Do you really think you can enslave me? I am a majestic creature birthed by Universe Ocean, and I am a destructive being—the opposite to the original universe. Do you really think you can enslave me?”

Luo Feng said coldly, “To be accurate, the ultimate king out of the one billion Sector Beasts represents destruction and stands against the original universe. As for you? You’re not qualified to do so.”

Morosa stared at Luo Feng with his two singular eyes and smiled wickedly. “That’s right. I’m not there yet. However, you’re only a creature born in the original universe. Do you really think you can enslave me?”

“Just sit and watch,” said Luo Feng indifferently.

Luo Feng flicked his fingers, and suddenly, traces of invisible threads gathered in front of him. The threads suddenly formed a strange picture. There was an ancient word made up of engravings on the picture.

“Enslave!”

The transparent picture broke the surrounding space and flew toward Morosa, penetrating its body.

Chi!

Morosa said something in a mild voice again, while Luo Feng lost his sense of the picture.

“Huh?” Luo Feng frowned.

“What now?” Morosa was exhilarated. “Show me everything you’ve got! Show me now! I’m a Sector Beast at the same level as you true gods. You’re only a true god yourself… Do you really think you can enslave me? Quick! Show me!”

Morosa was being suppressed by Luo Feng at the moment, so it reveled in upsetting Luo Feng.

“Humph!”

Hua!

Two traces of blurry, golden light shot out of Luo Feng’s eyes, and the two light pillars intertwined. All of a sudden, countless traces of golden light wound around each other, forming a gigantic network of golden threads. It covered Morosa and penetrated its body, but then, it vanished.

“How?” Luo Feng said. He heard Morosa’s jeering, but he didn’t care, as Morosa was only a suppressed Sector Beast. “The skills I performed are all the top-tier enslaving skills from Duan Dong River and the World of Jin.” Luo Feng couldn’t believe it. “I didn’t even feel its resistance before the skills I performed dissipated.”

Normally, those facing enslavement would fight against it. One party was trying to enslave the other, while the other party attempted to resist it. If one was too weak to resist, it would be enslaved.

However, Luo Feng didn’t even sense resistance when performing his top-tier enslaving skills. They all vanished once they entered the body of Morosa.

“And I didn’t feel any power consumption.” Luo Feng was confused.

Godly power and the power of the Sector Beasts would consume each other. However, that wasn’t the case for blurry godly power. Many true gods were able to perform soul attacks, and those attacks could penetrate the bodies of Sector Beasts and damage their souls. However, the blurry godly power he used vanished without even being resisted by the Sector Beast.

Does that mean that since it represents destruction, I’m not qualified to enslave it? Luo Feng shook his head. He wasn’t willing to give up like this. I might need to use the power of Sector Beasts.

Luo Feng pondered the issue.

******

Morosa was exhilarated. It was sneering and ridiculing Luo Feng. “Do you really think you can enslave me? Hahaha…! Come! Let’s see what you can do…” But then Morosa’s demeanor changed. “How?”

Morosa stared at the white-caped man in front of him, dazed. Luo Feng’s forces and power were quickly changing. Soon, Luo Feng became dark, emitting wicked forces—as if he were a Sector Beast. The only difference was that Sector Beasts had two heads while Luo Feng only had one. He didn’t want to change his shape as well.

“How can you become…?” Morosa shook his head. “It must be fake. You’re only simulating my look. The power you use isn’t the power of Sector Beasts. I can say that for sure.”

Ordinary Sector Beasts were also able to turn into true gods and produce godly power forces. However, those were all fake, as they weren’t actual godly power.

“Oh?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Luo Feng pointed, and the threads immediately gathered in the sky, soon forming a new picture. There was an ancient word, “Enslave,” on the picture; the difference was in the power that constituted the picture. The power used this time was the peak of the power of a Sector Beast.

The picture flew toward Morosa, who grew anxious for the first time. The picture penetrated its chest.

Chi!

The image immediately went into its chest.

“Sector?”

Luo Feng raised his eyebrows. He was able to sense the sector inside Morosa’s body through the picture. He had performed all sorts of skills, but they had all vanished each time they touched the sector. He hadn’t even been able to sense it. But this time, it penetrated the body, even after touching the sector.

“No wonder nothing worked before,” whispered Luo Feng. “There’s a sector inside the Sector Beast body that resists all other forms of power.”

The soul of Morosa was hidden in its sector, the most important part of its body.

Hou!

Its soul was roaring as it tried to resist it. The picture emitted endless traces of light and tried to suppress it. It tried to attach itself to the soul, attempting to merge with the soul.

Hou!

Its soul was trying everything, and the sector was empowering the soul. For a long time, it was a stalemate.

Peng!

The picture disappeared. Luo Feng had failed again.

******

Morosa looked at Luo Feng. It couldn’t believe what had just happened. It hadn’t expected a great being born in Universe Ocean—whom it viewed only as food—would be able to use the power of Sector Beasts! Even though Luo Feng was powerful, Morosa only viewed him as a more powerful meal. However, it doubted itself now. This weak meal was able to use the power of Sector Beasts, yet he hadn’t turned into a Sector Beast! If he had, Morosa wouldn’t have been able to resist it.

Without turning into a Sector Beast and without being bestowed with their power, Luo Feng had still been able to perform the power of Sector Beasts on his own.

“Impressive,” said Morosa. “You’re more powerful than I thought, but so what? Ever since Sector Beasts were born, we have had magnificent willpower.” Morosa stared at Luo Feng. “Our souls are almost perfect. Do you really think you can enslave me? Impossible! Even if you have the power of a Sector Beast, you wouldn’t be able to enslave me.”

Luo Feng smiled. He didn’t care about how Morosa reacted. Although he had failed again, he understood that there was a chance that he could succeed in enslaving a Sector Beast by using the power of a Sector Beast.

That only means my soul enslaving skills aren’t good enough yet, Luo Feng thought. I need to learn better enslaving skills.

And then, Luo Feng sat down with his legs crossed. He sat on the ground, facing Sector Beast Morosa in the distance.

“Single thought void space,” suppression from the sealing space, and the origin of the small universe—all three combined were repressing every inch of the power inside Morosa so that it wasn’t able to self-destruct at all.

“Come, come you…” Morosa was swearing and taunting.

However, Luo Feng pretended that nothing was happening. He didn’t care about it. Instead, most of his mind was on the godly power avatar under the black-striped stone pillar. The godly power avatar was studying the soul enslaving technique in a place where time traveled ten million times faster. He started to learn something more complicated.

He had improved a lot after comprehending the evolution of chaos when his miniature universe was born. However, after a year as a true god, Luo Feng had exploited the potential of his body and understood the “Invisible and Formless” ability. He tried to integrate his comprehension after his power peaked. Also, he had focused his energy on some fighting techniques of Star Tower and Wu Qi God. Meanwhile, he had never studied the technique to enslave souls, and prior to this war, Luo Feng had never even thought of enslaving Sector Beasts.

******

The more solid his foundation was, the more advanced enslaving techniques he could learn.

This time, Luo Feng was studying an enslaving technique he had obtained from the World of Jin. This enslaving technique had been created by a holy being under His Majesty the Godly King from Jin Country when it still existed. Its name was “Three Stars Sector.” It was arguably the best soul enslaving technique in the World of Jin. Even the enslaving techniques created by the Godly King of Jin couldn’t compare to that technique.

Everyone had their own strengths. When it came to enslaving, that supreme being from Jin Country was the most powerful. Three Stars Sector was an enslaving technique utilized through illusion. There were different enslaving techniques, including enslaving by strength and enslaving by illusions. As for enslaving by illusion, this was done by trapping enemies in illusions without letting them realize it, and then the enemies would become slaves.

******

Time passed. The technique was intricate, and soon, more than one year had passed.

“Luo Feng? Where is he?” Primal Chaos City Leader asked. He couldn’t wait any longer.

Luo Feng had captured the Sector Beast alive because he’d wanted to question it. He had asked Primal Chaos City Leader and the others to leave first, saying he would come back soon. But now, one year passed, yet Luo Feng still wasn’t back.

Inside the miniature universe, Star Tower was floating.

Inside a suppression area in Star Tower, the Sector Beast faced Luo Feng. It kept taunting, laughing, swearing, and provoking, but Luo Feng simply pretended it didn’t exist.

“I’ll be back soon, teacher.” Luo Feng said via message. He had finally learned the first volume of “Three Stars Sector.”

“You…” Morosa was shocked, as Luo Feng, who had been sitting for more than a year, suddenly stood up.

Luo Feng stared at Morosa. “Let’s see whether or not you can still resist it.”
