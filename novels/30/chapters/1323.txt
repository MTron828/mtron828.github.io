Chapter 1326: Terrifying Great Thunder Star Master

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Great Thunder Star Master thought he couldn’t gain anything even if he kept fighting Luo Feng. On the contrary, he might suffer losses if he wasn’t careful enough. He immediately decided to leave, and just when he started to flee, endless and dimming golden light spread, covering an area of more than one square light year.

Snowy sand floated. It was as if it were another dimension. The sand floated around the ocean but was immediately annihilated when it got close to the core whirlpool. Apparently, it couldn’t cover that terrifying area.

Golden Country and Snow Sand Ocean! They were performed at the same time!

Under “Duan Mie,” the power was incredibly strong, and it bound Great Thunder Star Master.

“Humph!” Great Thunder Star Master looked aloof. The binding affected him, but he could still be 100 times faster than light speed. It would just take him more time.

“Suppress!” Luo Feng’s beast god suddenly yelled.

Star Tower, which was trying to strike at Great Thunder Star Master like a mountain, suddenly started to spin. It started to give out a dimming light, and there were engravings on the surface of the tower that looked like screw threads. The light on the screw-thread engravings kept spinning, and Star Tower pressed against Great Thunder Star Master! In terms of speed, even great beings couldn’t compare with weapons.

Weng!

Star Tower had lost its ferocity before. Instead, it kept pressing down, trembling. Star Tower immediately fell on the head of Great Thunder Star Master.

“Huh?” Great Thunder Star Master, who was trying to flee, was like a mouse being suppressed by a giant rock. He couldn’t move. “Heavy! Too heavy!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Great Thunder Star Master felt the full impact of the pressure being exerted by Star Tower. It wasn’t just weight, but suppression. When Star Tower fell on him, it was as if they were combined; the weight from Star Tower became his weight as well. It felt as if he were carrying a miniature universe! It was so heavy that he couldn’t walk at all.

It was like Remote Ocean!

Remote Ocean couldn’t move by itself, and it was staggeringly slow! Now, Great Thunder Star Master was slower than endless Remote Ocean!

“Impossible, impossible!” Great Thunder Star Master yelled, and lightning burst from his body. The thunder light ball at the center of his body suddenly exploded and reached its maximum power. Great Thunder Star Master could only fly slowly—slower than 10,000 kilometers per second. “No, no, no!” he roared, trying to speed up.

Ten thousand kilometers per second was his limit. The more he sped up, the stronger the pressure from Star Tower became!

******

Luo Feng was quite satisfied.

“I’ve already fully comprehended the fourth and the fifth level of engravings on Star Tower. The fourth level is called ‘Hit.’ The fifth level is called ‘Suppress.'”

Luo Feng didn’t bother coming up with mysterious names. However, the fourth and fifth level of engravings on Star Tower excited him. The main function of Star Tower before was hitting, and it was at level four. The fifth level was at level eight. Under Duan Mie, it was at level nine! Under such powerful suppression, even Great Thunder Star Master found it difficult to move.

If you have a helper you can collaborate with, you can blast my Star Tower away, Luo Feng thought. If we were somewhere safer, you could keep fighting me. After all, maintaining attacks at level nine consumes a great deal of godly power, and I kept performing Duan Mie, so it consumes much more. You have a larger godly body have more advanced godly power, so you’ll definitely have an advantage if we’re stuck in a long fight. Unfortunately for you… I set you up! Everything’s going as planned. Die, Great Thunder Star Master!”

Thoughts flooded Luo Feng’s mind. When he controlled the fifth-level engravings, and when Star Tower suppressed Great Thunder Star Master, a giant object appeared from the ocean. The ancient ship showed up and raced toward Great Thunder Star Master.

“No!” Great Thunder Star Master felt that he was being pressured by Star Tower and couldn’t get away. He used “Universe Imperial Cone” to attack it, but even his own body was constrained by the suppression, so he couldn’t move Star Tower at all. He was incredibly slow.

Boat of Mausoleum, which was ten billion kilometers long, charged at him. He was slower than 10,000 kilometers per second, so he couldn’t avoid it at all!

“Humph!” Luo Feng’s beast god watched.

He was doomed! Great Thunder Star Master was definitely doomed! His godly power could maintain suppression at level nine easily. Great Thunder Star Master was being hit by Boat of Mausoleum, which couldn’t be moved even by a large group of universe masters. This terrifying ship could definitely push Great Thunder Star Master into core whirlpool, which was exceedingly powerful.

There was a tranquil portal at the very center as that at the center of a tornado. Sometimes, there would be true treasures emerging from the core whirlpool. However, Great Thunder Star Master would be crushed and killed before it could reach the center of the core whirlpool. Even universe supreme masters needed supreme true treasure palaces to survive the core whirlpool.

******

Star Tower was for suppression, Boat of Mausoleum was for pushing, and the core whirlpool was for killing.

Luo Feng stared at that thunder giant and delighted in his life withering away.

“You made me—you made me do this!” Great Thunder Star Master suddenly roared in anger. “Luo Feng! Luo Feng! You made me do this! You did this! Drop dead!”

Luo Feng sensed that something bad was going to happen.

“Quick, push him!” Luo Feng drove Boat of Mausoleum with all his power, making it as fast as possible.

At that moment, Great Thunder Star Master had gone completely insane. After that roar, there was black air everywhere on his giant body, surrounded by lightning. Black air emanated outward, making him howl in agony.

That mysterious black air looked harmless, but Luo Feng’s instincts told him otherwise.

Danger, danger, danger! Every part of his godly power was screaming as if it had encountered a terrifying being. Dodge!

Luo Feng rushed into Boat of Mausoleum. Star Tower was suppressing Great Thunder Star Master, so he could only hide in Boat of Mausoleum.

Great Thunder Star Master was insane. “You want to kill me?” he roared. “You can die first!”

The endless black air surged out of his thunder body, and it slashed the surrounding space. Its speed was limited like a domain true treasure, covering the area after it was performed. It spread toward Luo Feng instantly and started to pierce Golden Horn Beast Luo Feng.

“This is nothing, nothing,” Luo Feng told himself. “I can totally resist it. My Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor is also in the shape of a beast god, like a pinnacle true treasure palace.”

Although Luo Feng was fearful in his heart, his godly power was terrified, as if at the mercy of all-consuming flames.

His godly power was terrified of the black air; it wasn’t influenced by Luo Feng’s mind. Luo Feng’s logic told him that nothing existing in Universe Ocean that was this horrifying. After all, he was very powerful, and the beast god formed by Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor was like a pinnacle true treasure palace. Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor needed to be broken before his godly body could be hit! However, no supreme masters were able to break a pinnacle true treasure palace.

Hu!

The seemingly ordinary black air enveloped the entire Golden Beast God.

How did Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor form a beast god? It was via godly power! That was why there was godly power burning on Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

The black air and the golden beast god kept consuming each other.

As the black air completely enveloped the Golden Beast God, the godly power maintaining Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor was suddenly consumed at a fast rate! The black air was consumed as well, but there was too much of it, and it was coming from every inch of the godly body of Great Thunder Star Master.

“Hold it, hold it, hold it…” Luo Feng tried to transmit his godly power as much as possible to maintain Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor, but it was consumed faster than it was being supplied. It was like a ball of flames being extinguished by water.

As for Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor, it was disintegrated as soon as the godly power was fully consumed.

Hu!

The horrifying black air twisted into a weird shape, enveloping Luo Feng. Godly power and black air kept consuming each other!

“Hahaha…!” Great Thunder Star Master roared recklessly. “You made me do this! You made me do this! You’re only a universe master, and you don’t have much of a godly body or godly power! We’re not even at the same level. If you were a universe supreme master, you would be able to last longer… However, you’re only a universe master. Even if your godly power were 1,000 times more, you would still die in the end. Hahaha… Once you die, all your true treasures, including Star Tower, will be mine. Even if you have multiple bodies, they won’t make it in time to save you.”

Great Thunder Star Master was furious and excited at the same time. Just as he stopped shouting—

Hua!

Luo Feng’s godly body in the distance was already annihilated. He had no idea how to deal with black air like this. Even the memory stones from the Duan Dong River inheritance didn’t have any records of such black air! Or if there was, it had been covered by the original mind.

Luo Feng had no idea how to resist or attack it! And without an attack, he could only use his godly power. As for his original body, at 100,000 kilometers tall, it was already annihilated.

Hua! La!

The four silver wings, Crazy Demon Extermination Armor, a world ring, and Blood Shadow Blade all floated.

This greatly excited Great Thunder Star Master.

However, the enormous spaceship, Boat of Mausoleum, didn’t stop at all! Rather, it still slammed into Great Thunder Star Master.
