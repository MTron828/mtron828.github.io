“How’s that possible?” Including the powerful leader of the 13 axe, the 13 of them stared with fear, because the opponent’s appearance was simply too strange. It was fast to the point of teleportation! However even in fear, they all struggled hard to use their weapons!

13 images, 13 Luo Feng.

Luo Feng’s eyes grew cold, his gaze was like a blade, 13 images all looking at the 13 members.

His blade flashed! 13 extremely beautiful flashes, infused with immense hatred. Na Ke and his group who were witnessing this scene, including the 13 axe who were being attacked, couldn’t help but get affected by the blade work. Their consciousness was getting enticed into the bladework itself!

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

13 flashes of the blade like surgical blades followed the outline of their helmets immediately entering within and retracting. The continuous floating 13 flashes flashed and vanished. The images vanished too and Luo Feng placed his blood red illusionary blade back in its sheath which was on his back.

Silence!

The 13 warriors stood there, motionless.

The pure and innocent Na Ke, Thunder Uncle, along with the group of guards were all still immersed within the blade work. Luo Feng couldn’t help but shoot them a glance with a slight pressure from his consciousness, causing the completely immersed punks to awaken from the shock. All of them took a while to comprehend what just happened.

“Why are the 13 axe all standing there motionless? My eyes weren’t deceiving me before right, I saw…”A Guard said, clearly still stunned.

“Shut up.” The tall and sturdy thunder uncle communicated angrily.

The guard immediately awoken.

“Dead, the 13 axe are dead.” The tall and sturdy thunder uncle communicated. “Can’t you see from the 13 armors and helmets traces of blood dripping down? Since you all still have some bit of strength, can’t you sense that there’s no energy coming from them at all?”

“It’s true, there are blood stains.”

“No energy at all.”

“My god, I, didn’t see wrongly did I?. That stupid one called Feng…no that powerful black armored guy casually made a move and simultaneously killed 13 people, and the 13 axe actually couldn’t even retaliate?”

“I just saw 13 black armored warriors simultaneously slashing, the blade work was simply captivating.”

The group of guards were completely subdued.

Blood river world favored strength! And the blade work that captivated them made them tremor within!

“I was really stupid, so stupid!” The tall and sturdy thunder uncle’s body was trembling slightly. “The 1st time I saw this absolute warrior, he wasn’t standing there stupidly looking at the Mangu beast. He didn’t even think of the beast as an opponent. Even the 13 axe with 3 cloud levels, they couldn’t even retaliate and were all killed! Much less the Mangu beast? That group of bastards still said he was stupid…obviously it’s purely us who are stupid! Right, before when the Yu Family and troops wanted to humiliate our young master, they were all scared away. It was definitely him who helped us. Without revealing a trace, he scared away people like Dripping blood until they all fled. That’s a true warrior, absolute warrior!”

The silver armored Na Ke’s gaze at Luo Feng was filled with burning madness.

“Absolute warrior! A true warrior! Absolute warrior!” Na Ke muttered. “ The 13 axe easily killed someone like Yu Yan Ta. And he was a legendary warrior…however big brother Feng actually killed the 13 axe with them unable to even make a move. And they are still standing there motionless, like they didn’t even do anything. This, what kind of strength is this?”

“Young master, this is a true absolute warrior. The training hermit!” Thunder uncle’s face was excited, communicating, “His impression is not bad. You go hurry and get close to him, to be on good terms with such an absolute warrior, is most important for our Na Family.”

“Don’t bother me.” Na Ke didn’t care about anything about the Na Family at the moment. All he felt at this time was excitement!

The excitement from meeting a legendary idol!

Na Ke was nervous within, however he grit his teeth and walked towards Luo Feng.

……

After killing the 13 axe, Luo feng couldn’t be bothered with the stunned guards. He was using his spirit energy to scan over the bodies of the 13 axe along with Yu Yan Ta.

“These 13 axe are wealthy, everyone of them has a space item.” Luo Feng’s scan had confirmed. Controlling his spirit energy be it space bracelets to wrist bands, arm guards, space belts, he took all the items from their bodies and kept them within his space ring.

“Let’s see what’s in them.”

Luo Feng flipped his hand and retrieved a bracelet, using his spirit energy to pry it and check.

“Feng, big brother Feng.” An excited and nervous voice resounded.

Luo Feng turned, looking at the flushed red faced nervous and excited silver armored youth Na Ke. At this time the youth took a deep breath, his eyes barely containing his excitement and worship, “Big brother Feng, are you the legendary warrior who remains low profile and constantly roaming about the continent, hermit?”

“Hermit?” Luo Feng was stunned, following which he nodded and smiled, “I guess so.”

“Ah!”

Na Ke was extremely excited, “I heard that the hermits are low profile and powerful. They travel from world to world, constantly roaming, and their sights are extremely broad, having been to many mysterious places. Like the Blood demon ocean, Forbidden mountains, Ancient god ruins etc, have you been there?”

Luo Feng realized.

The youth before him was worshipping him, asking if he had been to these places. However…

Just what were these places he was speaking of.

He’s been to the dark universe, primal universe primal chaos city, world within a world, absolute beginning secret region, and even to the Virtual Universe Company’s headquarters. However! The Blood demon ocean, Forbidden mountains, Ancient god ruins within Blood river world, he had never even heard of them.

“I haven’t been there.” Luo Feng smiled and shook his head. “Maybe there’ll be a chance in the future.”

“Hm.” Na Ke was extremely excited. “I heard that the Blood demon ocean is 800 worlds away from us! Even the leader of a world city would take very long to get there.”

Luo Feng was shocked within.

The distance wasn’t far, however there was no flying ship technology in Blood river world. One could only fly himself. With the high gravity, how long would it take to fly 800 worlds away?

The world distance of the aboriginals of blood river continent, referred to the area territory of a world. Every world territory had a diameter of hundreds of millions of km up to billions of km! With such an area, even if one travelled 100,000km a day, it would still take 10,000 days to pass through 1 world.

800 worlds…

How many years would that take?

Luo Feng and Na Ke’s team walked towards the distant and vast swallow mound city. He walked while checking the items left behind by the 13 axe.

From the check, Luo Feng had some unexpected surprises.

“There’s actually so much currency, the 13 axe are indeed wealthy. Hm, with these, it will be much more convenient.” Luo Feng wasn’t too excited about the money. What he was truly excited for was, “There’s actually so many books. Most of them were training methods and so on, but there was a large amount of books with common knowledge and information about exploring the continent, similar to encyclopedias.”

The techniques and skills, Luo Feng couldn’t even be bothered with.

Having seen the Time space scribbles’ thousands of techniques, Luo Feng could easily create skills that were better than these.

It couldn’t even compare!

The training of Blood river world, couldn’t even compare in any way with humanity’s sacred training land primal chaos city.

“Common knowledge, encyclopedias.” Luo Feng randomly picked one and this book used a soft but sturdy material. On it were 3 words… “Blood river crystal.”

“Before, I was still worried about not knowing any information on the crystals. Yet, right now I have a book that explains in detail.” Luo Feng was very happy. The money didn’t mean much to him, he walked while using his spirit energy to scan the book and swiftly read through it and understanding the detailed information on the crystals.

Blood river crystals, the gems of the entire continent.

It had incomparable mysterious energy.

It was a treasure given to the continent by gods.

Only the high and mighty undying shrines would occasionally give the world’s a blood river crystal. Other than these shrines! No other power or person could create the crystals, even to the point of where they came from or how they are created.

Blood river crystals can be absorbed into the body, producing an incomparably mysterious effect! (As to its mystery? These books could only guess, not publicly explaining its effects.)

However not everyone could absorb the crystals into their bodies, as it had high requirements on the warrior. Under normal circumstances, warriors who had massacred more would find it easier to absorb one crystal.

The blood river crystal was something every warrior from the vast continent seeked.

However…

It was simply too valuable and rarely seen!

In the vast continent, the undying shrines had set a rule: Domain level (Domain lord) warriors, only after absorbing one blood river crystal will he have the right to dominate a territory. Normal Domain level’s have no right to become city leader.

World level (Sector lord) Warriors, they too have to absorb one crystal to have the right to dominate a world city!

……

Blood river crystals were rare and valuable! And absorbing them was even harder.

Just one alone was difficult, absorbing two would have 10 times the requirements on the body, 3 crystals would have a 1,000 times the requirements! The further one goes, the harsher the requirements! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

There was a saying on the continent…

A warrior who has absorbed 3 blood river crystals would have incomparable mysterious powers. Such a warrior would be named a blood warrior. And the blood warrior can go acquire the Blood river medal from the world city, they were the pride of the continent.

A warrior who has absorbed 10 blood river crystals would be called a Black warrior. He can go to the undying shrine to acquire the valuable black river medal.

The legendary blood warrior, it took countless years to produce one.

Black warrior?

It was purely a saying. No one even knew if there ever was a black warrior. In the last trillion years, maybe there wasn’t even one.

“So it’s like that.” Luo Feng closed the book and filled with glee within. “No wonder acquiring the blood warrior title gives 100,000 points. And acquiring one blood river crystal alone only gives 10,000 points. These two are obviously different in difficulty.”

He looked up.

Ahead was the entrance of the ancient city that was 100 zhang tall.

He had finally arrived at Swallow Mound city!
