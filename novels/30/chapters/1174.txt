Chapter 1176: Fight

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng was shocked. If it weren’t for the spirit of Shi Wu Wing, he wouldn’t have been able to tell that it was a trap.

“Human.” A ripple came. “Grab my core.”

Hua!

A light spot was attracted and flew toward the white wing. Star Tower was close to the white wings and the light spot.

“Grab it, and I’ll tell you how to make me recognize you and seal your godly power in it.”

“I’ve grabbed it.” Luo Feng let out his godly body, and he grabbed the light spot. It was a strange white bead. ‘I’ve grabbed it with my godly power, but I can’t seal my life imprint on it.”

“Don’t rush it,” the ripple said. “The more powerful a true treasure is, the more complex the process it. Grab the core and put it in your godly body…”

Luo Feng couldn’t help but laugh inside. If he put that core component inside Star Tower, the light would be let out instantly.

“In my body? I don’t dare to do that. I’ve decided to let my soul slave try first,” said Luo Feng.

“Soul slave? Your soul slave won’t succeed,” said the spirit. “One needs to have a perfect life gene level and great willpower. Do you have such a soul slave?”

“I can at least try,” said Luo Feng.

“Then try,” said the spirit.

It kept waiting. Once it went into Star Tower, it would be able to kill Luo Feng.

Star Tower took a step back.

Shua!

A black being flew out of Star Tower and went up in the sky, it was Mosha body.

“I come here and make you recognize me as your master.” Mosha body flew toward that bead.

The space around the white wing was quiet, and Mosha body could exist in that space.

“You let your soul slave do it outside?” The white wing was startled, as it couldn’t kill Luo Feng outside.

“Why not?” Luo Feng asked.

Mosha tried, and nothing happened.

“Only those who can fulfill the conditions can succeed,” said the spirit. “Your soul slave won’t be able to do it.”

“Why didn’t you say so before?” asked Luo Feng. “Even if it’s a powerful true treasure, it won’t have any reactions. However, nothing happened when my soul slave tried just now. I can say for sure that it’s a fake core. Give me the real one.”

“It’s different for supreme true treasures.”

“You’re lying,” said Luo Feng. “Give me the real core.”

The ripple stayed silent for a while.

“You’ll never be able to get out,” said Luo Feng. “You have to have a master. Give me your real core. I’ll do it once you give me the real core.”

“Damn it! Damn human! How did you find out?”

“You have finally stop pretending?” Luo Feng jeered. “You’re not as smart as you think. You started to set me up the first time I talked to you. You started with your broken memories and the fight, which shocked me. Indeed, it shocked me as I couldn’t imagine that such a true treasure could be damaged! And then you told me that the conditions are hard. Perfect life gene and willpower. And then, you wanted a pinnacle true treasure. Hahaha… One claim after another, you were just trying to lower my guard down. After all, you’ve been trying to stop me by giving all those conditions.”

Luo Feng smirked and continued. “Lots of great beings aren’t sharp enough. They might be hesitant if they could easily get valuables. However, if the conditions are high, they would be thrilled to know that they matched the criteria. Then they wouldn’t be suspicious anymore.”

“How did you start to suspect me?” asked the white wings.

“You told me you needed my help for material to repair yourself,” said Luo Feng. “And then, you kept telling me how harsh the conditions were and that I needed to sharpen my willpower. These two statements are totally contradictory to each other.”

“Contradictory? Contradictory how?” The white wing still hadn’t figured out the problem.

“If I’m really a universe master,” said Luo Feng. “My godly power will be 100 times life gene. Yet you want a perfect life gene level, which alone is already almost impossible. How can I reach the perfect gene? A real universe master might just give up and not help you anymore. You need my help, so you pretended that I was a universe master. However, the conditions you have can make a real universe master give up. Don’t you think it’s contradictory?”

Luo Feng smirked. “You also know that I have a supreme true treasure,” he went on. “If I can really get a supreme true treasure, do you really think I am a universe master with a life gene level of 100 times? Haha…! It’s contradictory. You tried to set me up. You thought if I was excited about matching all the conditions, I wouldn’t notice. However, from your perspective, your narrative is full of problems.” Luo Feng sneered.

It was difficult to realize that it was a trap. Fortunately, Luo Feng was cautious from the very beginning, which was why he had been able to realize it was a trap.

“The trap is too complex,” said Luo Feng. “I spotted its flaws. Stop fighting and give me the core. You need to have a master anyway.”

“You? My master?” said the white wings. “You’re not even close. Only the top-tier beings in Universe Ocean can be my master. You might not be able to utilize my power after an eternity. It’ll be to my shame and to my previous owner’s shame.”

“How upsetting.” Luo Feng shook his head and sighed. Then he gave an order: “Absorb.”

“Yes, master.” Shi Wu had waited for a long time.

Hong! Long! Long!

Suddenly, four wings extended from the four portals of Star Tower, and they started to bulge from the size of specks to larger than a star—as if Star Tower had grown four wings.

“Light, light from the origin!” Shi Wu was excited.

Hong!

Inside this mysterious place, the giant white wings started to shake. So did the blade of light, as if a towering skyscraper was able to collapse.

“No!” The white wings were terrified. “Spirit? Your wing has a spirit too? How is it possible?”

The blade of light started to fly toward that silver wings like moths flying toward a flame, and the giant white wings started to tremble as well, as if the blades were about to move.

“No! No!” The spirit of the white wing tried to control it. Ripples were transmitted to Shi Wu. “You, stop!”

“Why?” Shi Wu asked in a mild-mannered voice.

“Those energies are mine—mine!” said the spirit of the white wings.

“We are one; they’re yours and mine,” said Shi Wu. “Though you were more severely injured, I was, too. I need energies to recover. Don’t worry. I won’t take them all, just enough to recover.”

Shi Wu Wing kept sucking the light. One tried to control it. One tried to absorb it. However, there was too much light for the spirit of the white wings to control.

Hua! Hua! Hua!

The blade of light flew toward the four silver wings, and when it touched them, it was completely absorbed, like water touching dry land. Light started to flow on the wings, and the force began to change. Of course, that was only what was happening on the outside. The changes inside were sharper.

Luo Feng could feel those changes as the owner of Shi Wu Wings. Shi Wu was delicate, and it could grow to several light years high. Those small components in Shi Wu Wing changed sharply after absorbing the light, like a rotten log turning back into fresh, new wood.

“So satisfying!” Shi Wu was exhilarated. “Master, my broken memories are further recovered.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Huh?” Luo Feng was curious.

“I can remember how terrifying that fight was,” said Shi Wu. “The wing true treasure was completely dismantled. The white wings are the ones on the top, and they were damaged. The other five pairs of wings were damaged inside. After a long time, the surface was still intact, but the inner parts were severely damaged. I need energies to recover. Master, you don’t have enough godly power to revive me. The light from the origin is turned from my former master, and that’s what can repair me. Only that severely damaged white wing needs other material for repair.”

The Shi Wu Wings kept bulging. Hundreds of millions of kilometers… Billions of kilometers… Tens of billions of kilometers…

One light year, two light years…

It kept getting larger and absorbing more light, making the Shi Wu Wings more powerful.

“No, no! It’s mine! It’s mine!” The white wing was infuriated. “Stop!”
