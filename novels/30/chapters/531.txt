Within the palace, Blood god Baqi laughed as he walked down from the throne.

Luo Feng remained knelt there.

“Hm.” Baqi looked at Luo Feng kneeling on one knee, more satisfied as he looked. Blood river world was different from the universe. The universe had the Virtual Universe company and other huge powers nurturing their geniuses, allowing them to compete. However it was mostly a protective kind of nurture.

Blood river world was different!

There were over 10 million world cities on the continent. Countless sector lords fought against each other! Even if one was a genius, no matter how powerful, you’ll still have to experience slaughter to slowly reach the top! Hence Baqi would accept elites to build his own blood god guards, this was him preparing his genius army!

Right now he was in training. However, the moment he revealed himself, his power and status would have to be earned through slaughter!

Blood river continent worshipped strength! Worshipped slaughter!

“97, at cloud level 9 you are able to defeat a domain level 1 blood demon.” Baqi stood there, looking down at Luo Feng, “Right now you’ve even absorbed 3 blood river crystals. Your improvement speed would be even faster! Your level of talent is considered top level even amongst the geniuses absorbed by the undying shrine.”

“Under me, your benefits will definitely be no less than those geniuses nurtured by the undying shrine!” Baqi said confidently, “If you are loyal to me, I will treat you well!”

“Thank you Lord, I will do my best to support you and work for you.” Luo Feng knelt there, clean and respectful.

When Baqi heard those words, his smile grew wider.

“Haha…”

“Hahaha…”Baqi began to laugh even louder. The laughter resounded continuously around the palace, even the blood god guards in their training rooms on the 3rd level all looked up, wondering why their lord was so happy.

Baqi was all smiles, personally lifting Luo Feng till he stood there.

“Work hard.” Baqi smiled at Luo Feng. “First break through to domain level. As for the blood river medal, I haven’t taken over a world city. The medals that I initially brought with me have all been given out.”

“Ah.” Luo Feng was stunned.

Given out?

Meaning, Baqi didn’t have any blood river medals?

“Haha, 97, you little punk, the moment you heard there weren’t any medals…your expression changed.” Baqi smiled, “I understand your thoughts. I grew up listening to the legends of the blood and black warrior too, working hard to become a blood warrior and black warrior, to get the blood river medal.”

“That medal, to those who receive it, is simply just a medal and has no other meaning. To those that don’t receive it…it’s however a target that they’d chase for thousands to tens of thousands of years.”

“Hm!”

“I may not have any right now, but I’ll inform the undying shrine to give me a few more.” Baqi smiled at Luo Feng, “I estimate in about 10 days, if they are faster… within 6 to 7 days, they will send envoys to deliver the medals to me. Then, I’ll hand one to you.”

“Thank you lord!” Luo Feng’s expression was filled with gratitude as he bowed.

“Haha…go on! Breakthrough to the domain level!” Baqi smiled. “Ah, right, these are two blood river crystals! When you’ve absorbed them, look for me again.” Following which, he flipped his hand and took out two more crystals, they floated out of his palm and straight to Luo Feng.

Luo Feng respectfully received them, “Thank you lord.”

Baqi smiled as he looked at Luo Feng leave respectfully, following which he couldn’t help but laugh loudly again, causing the entire palace to tremble.

……

As Luo Feng left the 5th level, he met a few other blood god guards. They were all curious as to why Baqi was so happy. Hence they came to ask! Luo Feng naturally explained to them. Immediately the group of guards were all filled with envy, congratulating Luo Feng.

After which, Luo Feng left the palace and rushed straight into the sky, towards where the aura was thick and red.

“The 1st time I met Blood god Baqi, he was brutal, cold and without remorse. He would have killed me in a heartbeat.” Luo Feng smiled and shook his head as he flew. Exclaiming within, “However after so many years, now he’s attitude is obviously much better. He even got closer once he knew I absorbed 3 crystals.”

This was a form of trust.

When they first met back then, even though he had submitted, Blood God Baqi probably still hadn’t fully trusted him.

However after so long of sticking by the rules within his huge pit quarters, obviously Baqi was very satisfied and finally began to trust him. Maybe the level of trust wasn’t comparable to his captain number 1 or others, but because of Luo Feng’s talent, obviously Baqi still favored him heavily.

“Pity!”

“Baqi, I cannot stay in this blood river world. My area…is even more vast.” Luo Feng muttered within, “After I receive the medal, I’ll leave!”

“The next time I come will definitely be much much later.”

Sou!

He swiftly tore through the skies and headed towards his huge pit quarters.

After Luo Feng left, not long after, Baqi personally used his communication device to send a message to the undying shrine, requesting more blood river medals.

……

Undying shrine, its core region was within the ancient god ruins.

The area was vast. There were large amounts of mountain ranges, occasionally swamps, rivers, forests and huge pits etc…in this ten million km area, the killing aura was all around. Be it high in the mountain peaks or deep in the swamps and rivers, or in the huge pits, or floating in mid air…

In every core of the whirlpool auras was a glaring red sun.

In this entire region however there were a total of 10,081 aura whirlpools about. Every one of them revolving, most of them however were about ten times less or more than Luo Feng’s pit, the smaller ones had an aura of only 1/10th. There were all forms of aura whirlpools.

All different in strength, size and position. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

10,081 whirlpools, separated into skies, rivers, mountain peaks, valleys, naturally formed phenomenons!

“Rumble…”

“Ji!”

“Ang!”

Like an ancient beast howling, passing through trillions of years of time and space, resounding within a region.

In the center of these 10,081 whirlpools, there was an ancient shrine a million km in area, completely black and red in color. The surface layer had incomparably complex statues, some of them were of beasts roaring, some of undyings battling and so on. The ancient shrine surrounded by the 10,081 whirlpools, emitted the same ancient aura.

Just how big was an ancient shrine that had an area of 1 million km?

Earth was tiny compared to this shrine.

The size of the shrine was comparable to the sun!

This was the center of blood river continent’s strongest power. Even the Virtual Universe company hadn’t completely dominated this place.

……

Undying shrine, majestic and tall, in level 9,829 of the palace.

“Yuke.” A black armored silhouette stood before the throne. Gazing downwards, his voice boomed like thunder.

Below, a white uniformed man was kneeling, his head on the ground.

“Go get 20 blood river medals and with the fastest speed send them to Baqi.” The armored silhouette said indifferently.

“Yes, great god.” The white clothed man knelt and said respectfully.

“Go!” The silhouette said.

Shua!

The armored silhouette vanished from the palace. The white clothed man got up and turned to head outside, simultaneously shouting loudly outside, “Wula, get the team of special envoys ready, we are leaving immediately from the shrine.”

“Yes lord Yuke.”

A voice resounded from outside.

……

After a while, a dark purple disc shaped universe ship swiftly tore through the skies flying away from the shrine. Up in the 15th level of clouds, it flew quickly towards the huge pit.

The ancient god ruins were simply too vast. The universe ships created by the undying shrine paled far in comparison to Luo Feng’s automaton ship. Even flying in the cloud levels, the resistance was much higher than flying in space. Hence just the flight alone, Baqi said would require 6 to 10 days.

6 to 10 days here was blood river continent’s time.

In truth, compared to earth time, it was about 1 to 2 months.

……

In that ship, after flying about 20 days of earth time, within a wide river in the ancient god ruins was an island.

On that island.

A warrior was in training.

At the depths of the river was a huge aura whirlpool, endless aura emitted from within, making this island…as the best place to train.

“Lord!”

“Lord!”

Two silhouettes fiercely emerged from the surface of the water, landing on the island. These two shouted hurriedly, their voices rumbling…resounding throughout the island. With a domain lord’s strength, the power of those roars, one could only imagine.

“Lord.” “Lord.”

The two of them rushed until they were before a beautiful silver white palace, there stood a beautiful receptionist.

Rumble!

A silhouette rushed out from within the palace, immediately appearing at the entrance. With a wave of his hand, a wave of world energy formed a huge palm and slapped the two underlings shouting. It Knocked them so far back that they flew into the distant vegetation.

“I’ve already said it before.” Before the palace, dressed in a white robe, a bewitchingly handsome youth, with fox like eyes was staring at the two who were spitting out blood. “When I am training if you are looking for me, first let the AI know and let it inform me! You actually shouted and made a ruckus. I am teaching you a lesson this time, next time, don’t blame me for being merciless.”

The two guards immediately were shocked to their senses.

“We know our mistake.”

“We know our mistake.” The two quickly flew over and bowed respectfully.

“Hm.”

The fox like youth cleared his throat and said indifferently, “Speak, just what has gotten you both so crazy.”

“There’s some historical remnants at the bottom of the river.” One of the guards shouted.

“There’s some historical remnants at the bottom of the river, very likely from that battle countless years ago.” The other guard spoke.

The fox like youth stared wide eyed.

Historical remnants?

From that legendary battle?

“Bring me there quickly!” The youth ordered in a shrill voice, his face flushed red from excitement.
