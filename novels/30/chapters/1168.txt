Chapter 1170 Mauled by the Crowd!

Earlier on, the pierce of that long shuttle caused the golden flames in the surroundings to form a winding whirlpool; likewise, the heavy water flow in the surroundings also became a gigantic whirlpool. With just one stab!

Powerful! Swift! An Yong Master was just about to execute his greatest technique with a wave of his scepter, so he was not in time to concurrently ward off the sudden attack. He reacted quickly by using his left palm to execute a stance from his greatest technique, ‚ÄúSealing the Sky.‚Äù However, the power of this stance was weakened because it was executed with his left palm, where it should originally be executed through his scepter. Furthermore, An Yong Master did not have any attack type true treasures in his hand for self-defense.

The tip of the long shuttle pierced right through his palm.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù

An Yong Master‚Äôs godly body trembled. A large quantity of godly power was consumed, and his breathing weakened rapidly. In a split second, it had weakened to 50 percent and below. But in the blink of an eye, his avatar‚Äôs godly body, which was housed within his internalized world ring, speedily transmitted endless godly power to him, allowing him to recover right away.

Hong! Long! Long!

Darkness fell upon the water domain, and it fell into a chaotic world. Chaotic airflow spread all over.

‚ÄúShi Wu Wings, empower!‚Äù

‚ÄúFlame Sand Cup, empower!‚Äù

‚ÄúMiniature Universe, empower!‚Äù

Luo Feng was unstoppable. After executing Miniature Universe, without lifting a finger, he could rely on the terrifying oppression he had exerted earlier to gain an advantage over his opponent.

Not far away, by his side, the towering Blood Cloud Palace Master exuded endless ferocity. Holding onto his long shuttle, which was tens of thousands of kilometers long, he was also charging toward An Yong Master with a murderous intention.

Luo Feng and Blood Cloud Palace Master were joining efforts!

Everything was happening according to Luo Feng‚Äôs plan. Previously, with his Golden County and Flame Domain, he had defeated Ice Sand Ocean, thereafter everything fell within Luo Feng‚Äôs control. An Yong Master was unable to explore his surroundings, so naturally, he did not know that Luo Feng had secretly released his Golden Horned Beast body in the guise of Blood Cloud Palace Master.

‚ÄúBlood Cloud Palace Master!‚Äù An Yong Master saw him and was furious. He transmitted a roar of rage. ‚ÄúBlood Cloud Palace Master, although you have disappeared for a long time, you remain a figure of repute; in the primal universe, you did not bother to get acquainted with anyone. Yet today, you dare to lay an ambush on me without considering your position! And to help this human form Luo Feng sneak an attack on me?‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha! I shall get acquainted with whoever I please,‚Äù said Blood Cloud Palace Master, full of insolence. ‚ÄúWho are you to control me? I find Luo Feng pleasing to the eye, and both of us come from the same primal universe. Even if I don‚Äôt help him, do you think I will help you, someone from the first universe era?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlood Cloud, the two of us shall act in concert to deal with him!‚Äù Luo Feng shouted.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Blood Cloud Palace Master shouted back in response.

An Yong Master was forced to retreat with mixed feelings of anxiety and rage. Everything was supposed to be happening in his favor, but he hadn‚Äôt expected Blood Cloud Palace Master to turn up and attack him so suddenly. As a side note, it would be useful to know that the various top forces were always gathering information on certain high-end great beings.

Even Luo Feng‚Äôs information was sought after most thoroughly‚Ä¶ The Divine Eye clan would naturally have searched for information on Blood Cloud Palace Master and learned that Blood Cloud Palace Master fought against Star River Master in the original star and might have been on the losing end, but he did not lose much or even any of his godly power. Star River King had given his best but could only give up and leave in the end.

This battle raised the overall evaluation of Blood Cloud Palace Master. Over 100 different powers of Universe Ocean changed their evaluation right away.

The news is accurate, An Yong Master thought. I was originally extremely strong in defense, and I believed in the principle of ‚Äúan eye for an eye,‚Äù thus I dared to give ‚Äúan injury for an injury.‚Äù I did not expect that one pierce from my long shuttle‚Ä¶ would cost me 50 percent of my Divine Eye clan body.

An Yong Master was speedily retreating to buy himself more time as he anxiously scoured for countermeasures to deal with his situation.

Even if it were one-to-one against Blood Cloud Palace Master, it would be difficult to gain the upper hand. With these two joining forces, Blood Cloud Palace Master now has Luo Feng‚Äôs help, who will put his domain and miniature chaotic universe into play, I will be completely suppressed‚Ä¶ Between Blood Cloud Palace Master and myself, I am afraid the result will always be failure without victory!

The thought flashed passed him within an instant. The speed of a great being was extremely fast.

How satisfying, thought Luo Feng. To be able to execute Miniature Universe within the Universe Ocean is truly a delight.

Luo Feng was high on emotions and let out an excited howl. Universe Ocean was filled with chaotic airflow all over, and the purity level of this chaotic airflow was extremely high. The surroundings of Tilted Peak Sector might have thinned down the chaotic airflow, but it was, nonetheless, incomparably pure.

After executing his Miniature Universe, Luo Feng was delighted to discover that‚Ä¶ the chaotic airflow he could control, when mixed together with those chaotic airflows of high purity level, could undergo a heightened boost in power in an instant.

‚ÄúMiniature Universe and chaotic airflow, gather!‚Äù Luo Feng gave a sudden shout of command.

Hua! Hua! UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

Miniature Universe gave form to two gigantic tornado whirlpools, and each moved to encircle Luo Feng‚Äôs blade and Blood Cloud Palace Master‚Äôs Star Tower long shuttle, respectively.

Hua!

Star Tower long shuttle moved to pierce An Yong Master again.

Xiu!

A dazzling golden blade sliced toward An Yong Master.

‚ÄúBastard‚Ä¶!‚Äù

An Yong Master was anxious and furious. With his scepter in his hand, he transformed into a hazy shadow to execute his greatest technique, Sealing the Sky. Then a loud, rumbling bang was heard, and An Yong Master felt a great tremor throughout his godly body. The dazzling golden blade had hit him from behind, causing his godly body to tremble and immediately weaken by 10 percent.

‚ÄúDamn, damn!‚Äù An Yong Master was infuriated.

‚ÄúHahahaha! An Yong, today shall be your day of annihilation.‚Äù Luo Feng was overflowing with arrogance.

Blood Cloud Palace Master revealed a sardonic smile. ‚ÄúYou are dead meat.‚Äù

Hong! Hong!

The two attacked in concerted efforts. Where An Yong Master could ward off Blood Cloud Palace Master, he would not be able to defend against Luo Feng. On the other hand, blocking Luo Feng would mean that he was not able to ward off Blood Cloud Palace Master.

After all, Blood Cloud Palace Master was able to activate the second-level power of Star Tower long shuttle, which was extremely fast.

Luo Feng‚Äôs blade technique, Golden Light, was also known for its speed. With the triple empowerment of Miniature Universe, Flame Ocean, and Golden Country, it was even faster, causing the speed of An Yong Master‚Äôs weapon to slow down. No matter how strong a technique he had, he could barely ward off Luo Feng or Blood Cloud Palace Master. Undoubtedly, his choice would be to ward off Blood Cloud Palace Master.

Blood Cloud Palace Master is certainly fourth-tier! thought An Yong Master. And with the empowerment of his surrounding domain, he would most probably be comparable to fifth-tier. That human form may only be on second-tier, but with the empowerment of his surrounding domain, he could be comparable to fourth-tier.

An Yong Master‚Äôs heart was in his throat. His anxiety was at its peak.

The power level was soaring; the increase was doubled.

Golden Horned Beast body had a supreme true treasure, barely making it a fourth-tier combat power. Usually, universe masters with supreme true treasures would wield combat power up to the sixth tier. However, Luo Feng was unable to bring the power of this supreme true treasure to full force for two reasons. One, he was only able to comprehend Star Tower up till its second form; two, the strength of his godly power was still too weak.

Combined with the triple empowerment, it was certainly comparable to fifth-tier combat power. However, true fifth-tier beings like Primal Chaos City Leader and Star River Master usually had pinnacle domain true treasures with them when they roamed Universe Ocean. With their capabilities, they could activate pinnacle domain true treasures to higher forms, and these activated forms were much stronger than those of Sky Wolf Master.

‚ÄúI may be weaker than Star River Master and Teacher, Primal Chaos City Leader, but I think I still have the confidence to trample An Yong Master with the two of us working together.‚Äù

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Blood Cloud Palace Master and Luo Feng‚Äôs original body attacked without inhibitions. They surrounded An Yong Master and subjected him to a crazy round of attacks!

‚ÄúStill dare to be so arrogant! Still thinking of killing me! Dream on!‚Äù Luo Feng ranted as he trampled on An Yong Master.

An Yong Master was so furious that his entire face glowered. The single-eyed shadow in the circular light behind him became distorted. He was angry beyond sanity. He was a universe master of top-tier existence (the fourth tier) with extremely strong defensive ability. If tackling an opponent one-to-one, even a universe supreme master might not have been able to force him to give in. But now, it was two against one, and every time there was an exchange of blows, he was on the defensive.

Godly body is weakening! Recover!

‚ÄúWhat great tolerance!‚Äù muttered Luo Feng.

Luo Feng was cursing and swearing at An Yong Master in his heart. An Yong Master only maintained his defense against attacks by Blood Cloud Palace Master, regardless of how Luo Feng rained his attacks on An Yong Master. Every time his godly body started to weaken, it would speedily recover.

In the blink of an eye, nine seconds passed. Luo Feng stopped his sustenance of Miniature Universe, and the next moment, the vast Miniature Universe dissipated. The chaotic airflow in the surroundings also dispersed. The suppression over An Yong Master was immediately reduced. An Yong Master saw his chance and quickly transformed into a stream of light and fled the scene.

‚ÄúWant to escape?‚Äù Blood Cloud Palace Master roared.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give chase!‚Äù Luo Feng shouted. ‚ÄúThis An Yong Master is a hardcore fellow who is almost impossible to exterminate.‚Äù

Luo Feng also recovered the sealed space.

An Yong Master released the sealed space while he was being mauled by Luo Feng and Blood Cloud Palace Master. The moment he felt the space ripples, he made his escape by teleporting far away immediately. He did not want to be surrounded and attacked. Using up his godly power was not a big deal. The sense of helplessness when subjected to attacks in such a manner was overbearing. It was a great insult.

Deep in the water domain, Luo Feng and Blood Cloud Palace Master stood side-by-side.

‚ÄúHe has teleported away.‚Äù

Luo Feng sneered. With a single thought, he summoned Blood Cloud Palace Master (which was actually Golden Horned Beast body in disguise) back into his world ring.

‚ÄúEven if news of Blood Cloud Palace Master and I joining forces against An Yong Master spreads, nothing much will happen,‚Äù Luo Feng said to himself. ‚ÄúAfter all, Blood Cloud Palace Master has no enmity toward the human race. Furthermore, An Yong Master would not wish to lose face, so he will not be spreading news so detrimental to his reputation.‚Äù

Whether the news spread or not really did not matter. Luo Feng had already offended the three major alliances (namely, the demons, automaton race, and the bugs soldiers). Those that he had established good ties with were the Ancestral God School, the Space Beast Alliance, and his own kind, the human race. They would not make much out of him forming an alliance with Blood Cloud Palace Master.

Shua!

Luo Feng flew straight out of the cave.

In the vast Universe Ocean, there were the seven Miniature Universes of the Divine Eye Clan. In the palace hall, An Yong Master sat on his throne, his face contorted into a fearsome look. His anger was insuppressible.

‚ÄúDamn, damn, damn!‚Äù An Yong Master roared. Suddenly, he frowned, and with a flip of his hand, a mirror appeared in front of him. In the middle, a figure clad in golden armor appeared.

‚ÄúAn Yong,‚Äù said the figure.

‚ÄúGolden Surveyor,‚Äù said An Yong.

‚ÄúAn Yong, I was just rushing out from the internal domain of Tilted Peak Sector. Why are you contacting me all of a sudden?‚Äù

‚ÄúGolden Surveyor Master, I have disappointed you.‚Äù An Yong Master lowered his head a slight degree to express his apology, then raised his head and said, ‚ÄúI was dealing with the human Luo Feng from the primal universe, but I had not expected him to have Blood Cloud Palace Master‚Äôs help. With Blood Cloud Palace Master and Luo Feng joining forces, even I will be at the losing end‚Ä¶ This operation has failed.‚Äù

‚ÄúFailed?‚Äù Golden Surveyor Master was a trifle annoyed. ‚ÄúIf you did not have full confidence, you should have enlisted my help right away. I have already penetrated layers of danger, and now you are asking me to turn back? Such an event had better not happen a second time!‚Äù

Hong!

The figure in the mirror vanished instantly.

An Yong Master could only let out a low grunt. There was nothing he could do. In terms of power and status, Golden Surveyor Master was always a notch above him. Owning a pinnacle domain type true treasure already, to a certain extent, reflected Golden Surveyor Master‚Äôs ability.

‚ÄúBlood Cloud Palace Master‚Ä¶ Human Luo Feng‚Ä¶ The moment I discovered Luo Feng, I wasted no time in sealing space. There was no way Blood Cloud Palace Master could possibly have rushed over from the outside world. He must have been in Luo Feng‚Äôs world ring. But no matter how close they were, it was unlikely that Blood Cloud Palace Master would have followed him so closely, unless-‚Äù

An Yong Master‚Äôs eyes flashed with realization as he gritted his teeth.

‚ÄúI knew it! The humans want to protect Luo Feng, and Blood Cloud Palace Master‚Äôs help is all part of their arrangement. No wonder‚Ä¶ No wonder Blood Cloud Palace Master has never taken any action against the human race and is always wearing a mask. Blood Cloud Palace Master must be human!‚Äù
