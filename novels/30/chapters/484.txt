Chapter 486: Undying Altar

“6.2 million mixed elements and luck?” A huge wave crashed within Luo Fengs heart. 6.2 million mixed elements! what a terrifying amount that was? The entire Black Dragon Mountain star field alone was only worth about 300,000 to one million mixed elements.

“Back then, your teacher had to break out his entire fortune to make it successfuly! When the cloud contact vine reached the undying level, it was extremely powerful. It was even more powerful than normal human undyings. When your teacher had it, it was almost like his power had doubled. Even if others were stronger than your teacher, they would find it extremely hard to kill him.” Babata said.

Very hard to kill?

Didn’t he get killed in the end anyway? Luo Feng thought.

“Points, points.” Luo Feng was nervous.

The amount needed to be a accumulated wasn’t easy to complete.

Breaking through however was very difficult. To nurture a cloud contact vine up to the sector lord level…the price alone gave him a headache, as it would require about 120k points in total.

“Buying the Time Space scribbles requires points, nurturing the cloud contact vine requires points, repairing the Yun Mo Planet ship requires points, and on top of that they all need such huge amounts of it.” Luo Feng thought, “At least currently my stress level still isn’t that elevated.”

……

Luo Feng had barely enough point to use at the moment. He didn’t need to nurture the cloud contact vine or repair the ship yet.

“Teacher!”

Within classroom 2, over a 100 absolute beginning members bowed respectfully.

“Hm.” A 30m tall demon god undying walked into the room. His entire body was almost like metal, with 3 horns on his head. With a rumble, “Gold, as strong as the sun and iron, it’s sturdy, unstoppable! Space holds within it all sorts of things and their energies. When time stops space is all that is in the universe!”

Silence. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This undying didn’t allow anyone to speak at all during his classes, and he would always start the classes with those symbolic words about gold like the sun, space encompassing everything! This violent tempered and wild being with a weird temperament, still had many members that enjoyed his lessons.

This undying explained to the class. With a wave of his hand, origin laws could be seen floating in its path.

“It’s that way.”

“Ah.” Luo Feng carefully listened, occasionally realizing something important, sometimes nodding and at other times frowning.

After a while…

The class ended.

Luo Feng turned and was taken aback. Yi Ke who was beside him had suddenly vanished.

“Ah? Usually even if he leaves the virtual universe, he would say goodbye.” Luo Feng was curious, “It’s weird that he left halfway?” At this time, Luo Feng tried to call Yi Ke, however…

“It’s cut off?”

Luo Feng smiled, “Must be something important.”

The call denial service was normal and regularly seen. Usually while one was studying, training or on a mission…they couldn’t be distracted. Hence, they would choose to cut off all contact from the virtual universe network. There was of course one more possibility and that was death. The moment one dies, the AIs and quantum computers would be unable to go online, naturally not allowing any calls.

******

After finishing the lesson, Luo Feng didn’t rush to choose a technique from the golden horned beast. He decided to head to the undying altar and Fantasy ocean to give it a shot.

“Points!”

“Right now I require 100s of thousands of points, and i would even need more in the future.” Luo Feng was worried. “How do I get more points? Just from the heavenly bridge won’t be enough at all.” From what the two domain lords Yi Ke and Za Ji wu had said, Luo Feng was able to deduce that the points would get more valuable later on. Even undying would use money to exchange for points.

Because, the Virtual Universe Company’s treasure trove only allowed exchanges for points.

“First I’ll hit the undying altar and fantasy ocean to take a look.”

……

Core members could easily enter any of the 3 places, heavenly bridge, undying altar and fantasy ocean.

Undying altar.

A black endless mountain range and on each of the peaks there was a golden altar. With one look, one could see that on the tens of thousands of peaks there were similarly tens of thousands of golden altars.

Shua!

A black haired youth appeared in one of the golden altars.

“Hm?” Luo Feng appeared before the altar, feeling somewhat uncomfortable. “I can’t feel the universe origin law ripples. I can’t feel the energies from the outside world too, the genetic energy within is gone too, and my spirit energy has been reduced to a bare minimum as well.”

Peculiar, it was a very uncomfortable feeling!

Losing his genetic energy, spirit energy, all the ripples of the origin laws…everything was gone.

The only thing that remained was his physical body strength!

“Purely testing my strength.”

“Undying altar!” Luo Feng looked up. This altar had a total of 99 points. Right at the top was the 100 point mark. “Only when one’s body exertion reaches 100 points will one have perfect control over their body.”

Standing on the altar, he swiftly reached the stand.

On the stand was a human shaped target. Beside it was a screen with the words, which, when translated into mandarin read, “Within 1 second, please use your fists, elbows, head, knees and feet separately to attack the target. According to the lowest attack, we will determine your strength.”

“5 attacks?” Luo Feng was stunned.

He originally thought it would be like earth’s measurement, where just 1 punch would do.

He didn’t expect that he had to do 5 attacks separately with these body parts all within 1 second.

“Let’s give it a shot.” Luo Feng started to wiggle his muscles and bones.

“Pa!” He attacked the target.

Rumble! His leg swished through the air.

“Hm.” Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed, immediately attacking the target before him.

In an instant Luo Feng’s body became like a circular movement. His fists were like a mythical beast punching strongly against the target’s head, 1 attack!

After which he bent his body and condensed his energy, violently kicking the chest of the target, causing it to cave in slightly, 2nd attack!

The moment he landed, he once again fiercely jumped up and raised his knee to smash into the target’s stomach, exploding with energy, 3rd attack!

After which he arced his body and almost like a large bow, slapping backwards and smashing his forehead into the target’s chest, 4th attack!

After which his entire body jumped up and with a right twist, his muscles seemed to condense into knots and released all his energy into his right elbow, smashing hard into the target, 5th attack complete!

“Hm?” Luo Feng looked at the screen.

The numbers that appeared…

“31, 28, 36, 29, 35, score 28, points awarded 0.”

“My exertion is only 28 times?” Luo Feng shook his head.

Back on earth, that 9 level thunder blade’s highest level was only 7 times. Of course the current Luo Feng’s perspective was completely different. He could easily create thousands of techniques better than the 9 level thunder blade, just like how the creator of the 9 universe tablet could write so many techniques in Time Space Scribbles.

“In 1 second, use 5 portions of your body to attack, the lowest score will be your score.”

“Hm, the requirements are harsh.”

After trying that one time, Luo Feng understood why, “In a short amount of time to use all these parts to reach 100 points, that would mean one should have perfect control of his body.”

“Again!”

5 continuous attacks, 5 results again, “35, 30, 36, 29, 35, score 29, points awarded 0.”

“Again!”

Score 28.

“Again.”

Score 30.

……

Time and again, he tried non stop over hundreds of times. His best score was only 32, and the lowest was at 26. Ultimately, he still got 0 points!

Passing the heavenly bridge, fantasy ocean and undying altar could help one get points.

However they had different rules.

The 9 universe heavenly bridge had a total of 27 levels. The 1st level gave 100 points, 2nd 200, 3rd 400…and they compounded on, each giving twice the amount of the last level before.

The fantasy ocean had many islands. From the outermost island, as one was heading inwards deeper into fantasy ocean islands, the hypnotism and mental pressure would get increasingly terrifying. The point system was similar to the heavenly bridge.

From outside going in, there were a total of 21 islands.

The 1st gave 100 points, 2nd 200, 3rd 400…it compounded on, the deepest of the fantasy ocean being island 21.

……

Even undyings and the knights would attempt fantasy ocean and heavenly bridge as they yielded high points.

However the undying altar was different.

Perfect control of one’s entire body was a prerequisite to becoming undying. Hence the points given were the lowest of the 3.

If one got a score of 50, he would be awarded 1,000 points.

Score of 60, 2,000 points.

Score of 70, 4,000 points.

Score of 80, 8,000 points.

Score of 90, 16,000 points.

Score of 100, 50,000 points.

But for a score below 50, 0 points.

……

“My strength usage is so weak?” In that particular altar amidst the tens of thousands of golden altars on the black mountain range, Luo Feng tried over and over. He tried for a total of tens of thousands of times. Even after using one entire day, his best score was still only 34.

He couldn’t blame anybody.

Firstly he was a spirit reader, he never really trained using his strength that way.

Even though the Mosha clan was proficient in close combat, it was after all an energy life form. It didn’t rely on muscles or bones to unleash its strength, it didn’t even have a strength per se, hence it couldn’t train in this aspect.

As for the golden horned beast, it was a blood and flesh life form, and it did emphasize on strength exertion!

However!

These many years, the golden horned beast had been specializing in Absolute space and Deities of the world. The rest of it’s time was spent studying the gold origin laws. It never actually trained in any battle techniques. However, its body make up was naturally gifted in strength exertion. Even if it didn’t specially studied it, it could still reach about 60 or 70 points.

Human body’s strength usage however was harder.

For Luo Feng to reach 34 points, that was still mostly because of his strong consciousness and his comprehension of the origin laws.

“How shameful, I actually got 0 points.” Luo Feng thought. “When I return, I have to find a battle technique for the golden horned beast that emphasizes on strength exertion. Strength exertion is one of the requirements to become undying, I cannot overlook it.”

“Hm, so what if I can’t get any points from the undying altar, I’ll head to fantasy ocean next.”

“My consciousness and willpower is what I’m the most confident in.”

“Fantasy ocean, I have to go deeper and get more points.” Luo Feng immediately headed towards fantasy ocean.

Suddenly…

“Hm, mail?”

Luo Feng pointed in mid air and a screen appeared, and on it was a mail. “It’s from the Virtual Universe Company?”

Di!

Luo Feng opened the mail and as he read, his entire face went completely pale.

“That’s not possible, it’s impossible.” Luo Feng couldn’t help but shake his head.
