Chapter 1356: Split

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After entering the World of Jin, Luo Feng was particularly curious about true gods of void space. They were at a higher level than true gods. He tried to get as much information about them as possible.

Based on the comprehensive information about true gods from Duan Dong River inheritance—and the information he had received from his conversations with Northern Wind and Wu He—he knew that true gods had miniature universes, and their orders, once given, would be strictly enforced.

However, that could only be achieved in Universe Ocean and the original universe, and it couldn’t be achieved in the World of Jin. The so-called “strictly enforced” orders were a form of respect shown by the original universe. They gave a particular area to true gods for them to control.

That was how true gods did things. However, when the original mind chose not to back down, as when true gods were fighting universe masters, the original mind would stand with universe masters. Then true gods couldn’t do it anymore.

Apparently, making their orders strictly enforced wasn’t an ability that true gods gained after fully comprehending laws. Instead, it was a gift like having multiple bodies and other inherited techniques given by the original universe. If the original universe wanted it back, they wouldn’t be able to do it anymore.

However, there was a huge gap between true gods and true gods of void space. Once someone became a true god of void space, they would have a much deeper understanding of the universe, and based on their law comprehension, they would be able to control a void space completely. It wasn’t a gift. Rather, it was total control. Even the original mind couldn’t strip someone of abilities they gained by themselves.

True gods of void space! With a single thought, the void space was formed! In that vast void space, true gods of void space could display incredible power!

True gods couldn’t use their abilities to slaughter universe masters, yet true gods of void space could use one thought to form a void space to slaughter true gods and universe masters. That was the difference between abilities bestowed by the original mind and those comprehended by oneself. With the power of forming a void space with a single thought, any true god of void space could be an overlord of an area in the World of Jin.

The entire Nine Smoke Marsh was blocked from the outside, as a void space surrounded the entire marsh.

“Morons from Xuan Yu Mountain! You dare to cross us again?”

A clear voice that sounded like flowing water echoed in Nine Smoke Marsh. It sounded like it could penetrate one’s mind. All of a sudden, the power contained in the void space around Nine Smoke Marsh seemed to be multiplied as if two void spaces were fighting for control.

Hong! Long! Long!

Lots of strange beasts rushed out of Nine Smoke Marsh, and the strange beasts were all roaring. In front of those thousands of true god strange beasts were three larger beings. The middle one had green scales, a tentacled body, and nine heads. They all looked breathtaking. She was Nine Smoke, the ancient being who ruled Nine Smoke Marsh. Nine Smoke Marsh was named after her!

Hua! Hua! Hua! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After the true gods rushed out, led by those three true gods of void space, law universes surged to the sky.

In the grass, Luo Feng and Wu He looked up and saw the two armies standing against each other.

“Nine Smoke is a very powerful true god of void space.” Wu He transmitted his voice. “Nine Smoke Marsh is famous for her. Even my father appreciates her power. However, she has a strange temperament. Nobody can satisfy her, which is why those powerful true gods of void space don’t want to be with her.”

Luo Feng transmitted his voice. “But Nine Smoke Marsh has three true gods of void space.”

“That’s because…” Wu He smiled oddly. “The other two true gods of void space were chased by their enemies, and they didn’t have anywhere else to go except to stay with Nine Smoke. My father said he could easily kill the other two true gods of void space.”

Luo Feng was dazed. Could there really be such a large power gap between true gods of void space?

It sounded about right. He was a universe master, and if he took a long enough time, he could kill a true god. As for other universe masters, if he utilized all his power, he could kill them with one move. Among those true gods of void space, even if the gap wasn’t that large, it was still possible for one true god of void space to suppress another.

“Wu He,” Luo Feng said, transmitting his voice. “I heard that all the major tribal powers and strange beast powers all led by true gods of void space, but I haven’t heard of anyone stronger than a true god of void space. Is there anyone more powerful?”

Although he didn’t know the levels above true gods, based on Duan Dong River, the ultimate goal of the law path was to control the chaos law, yet that wasn’t the end. The three ancestral teachers from Duan Dong River were above the chaos laws. As for true gods of void space, they hadn’t even manipulated chaos laws yet.

“Tribal powers, strange beast powers… No matter how powerful they are, they are led by true gods of void space,” said Wu He. “As for those more powerful? There are…”

Luo Feng listened carefully to what Wu He was about to say.

“The supreme leader of the East Army,” he said. “The general of the Easy Army!”

“The general?” Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed.

“The military is the most powerful organization in the World of Jin. There are East Army, North Army, South Army, and West Army! The four generals who lead the four armies are the supreme beings in the World of Jin. Rumor has it that they’ve already surpassed true gods of void space and reached a higher level.”

“What level is that?” asked Luo Feng.

“I don’t know.” Wu He shook his head. “My father didn’t tell me.”

Luo Feng was confused.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Wu He asked, irritated. “If you really want to know, you can earn military credits and trade them with the information in the military.”

Wu He was displeased. Although he was a child of the Northern True Ocean, he was actually the weakest child, so his father always neglected him.

******

Just when Luo Feng and Wu He were transmitting their voices to communicate with each other and were looking up, the negotiation between the supreme leaders of Nine Smoke Marsh and Xuan Yu Mountain didn’t go well at all.

“Nine Smoke, you’re being too reckless. You don’t want to share anything with us? Do you really think four true gods of void space of Xuan Yu Mountain can’t rival you alone?”

“You want to share something? Be my sidekicks. Then I’ll happily give some to you.”

“Ah! You’re asking for your own death! Warriors from Xuan Yu Mountain—punish that goddamn bastard from Nine Smoke Marsh!”

Following a furious roar, the two teams started to engage in battle. Soldiers fought soldiers, and leaders fought leaders. Both teams charged at each other swiftly.

Luo Feng looked up. It was as if the clouds from both sides immediately crashed into each other and merged.

“It has begun,” said Wu He, exhilarated.

“It has begun,” Luo Feng said. He held his breath.

******

There were many variables in war, and it was difficult to predict which side would win. Even though true gods of void space could influence the situation to a large extent, their soldiers were more influential.

Quantity sometimes made up for quality. Law masters were weaker than true gods, but 10,000 law masters performing their combined techniques could defeat any true god!

Similarly, true gods were weaker than true gods of void space, but 1,000 true gods could rival a true god of void space. And if a machine-type valuable was involved, such as “Jiu Xiu,” 100 true gods could wield the power of thousands or even 10,000 true gods, and they had a stronger defense and were more flexible. 100 true gods using Jiu Xiu could certainly rival a powerful true god of void space. As for those weaker true gods of void space, they might be killed.

In a true, major war, true gods could play a very important role if they were equipped with machine-type valuables, like “Jin Luo Sky and Land,” which required at least a million true gods to operate; it could kill a whole group of true gods of void space at once.

The World of Jin was ruled by His Majesty the Godly King, so some machine-type valuables that needed a group to operate were forbidden to use, not to mention Jin Luo Sky and Land. Even Jiu Xiu wasn’t owned by any tribal or strange beast powers.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

In the dark land, the two powers were fighting each other, and law masters were the ones who died first. Lots of godly bodies were quickly consumed, and under some terrifying combined attacks, some law masters were killed instantly while their weapons and armors dropped.

“Weapons and armors!”

Universe masters in the distance kept dying, and their weapons and armors kept falling. This excited Wu He.

“These are all worth military credits.” Wu He’s eyes gleamed. He gazed at the falling weapons and armors, then looked at Luo Feng. “Milky Way, hurry up! Those weapons and armors are not precious at all. Few of them will be gathered up by the warriors, and others will be neglected. We can totally certainly a great many weapons and armors. We might get 10,000 military credits! Then we can finish our task and survive.”

Bodies of true gods and weapons of law masters were the requisites for proof. Even if Wu He didn’t kill the law master, as long as one died and he retrieved the weapons, the military points could still be counted as his.

In some ways, it encouraged mutual killings.

Luo Feng shook his head. “There are only 10,000 law masters from Nine Smoke Marsh who participated. It’s unrealistic for you to collect 10,000 weapons and armors. If we can collect the bodies of true gods, we can finish the task immediately.”

“You—you…” Wu He was anxious as he gazed at the falling weapons and armors. He appeared both worried and furious. “Milky Way! You…! How powerful do you think you are? True gods are important great beings to all powers. If a true god dies, someone will be responsible for collecting their body. You won’t stand a chance of getting them! As for fighting them? Do you really think you’re strong enough to meddle in a fight like this? You’re being suicidal!”
