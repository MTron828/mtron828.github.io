Chapter 1311: Last-Ditch Struggle

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Get in, everyone.”

“Get in.”

Father God from the automaton race, Shock Demon Ancestor, Dream Demon Ancestor, Prison Race Devil Ancestor, Holy Master from the crystal race, Bug Empress, Northern Territory Alliance Master, Space Beast Ancestor, Black Universe Creator, E Zhou, Virtual-Real Devil Master, and Shi Hua Island Leader all gathered the universe masters under them back to their world rings or true treasure palaces.

For what it was worth, the united forces alliance team didn’t count on winning anymore. They just wanted to get away while preserving as much power as possible! As long as they could escape Remote Ocean, the humans were still at a disadvantage. However, if the humans captured a group of universe masters, the united forces alliance would lose that group of universe masters, who could add to the humans’ power. The effect was significant.

“Quick!”

Luo Feng transmitted his voice in Remote Ocean. “Uncle Darkness, we need to act now. The united forces alliance is making a last-ditch struggle.”

“Okay.” Darkness Master was nervous.

Mosha body, beside Star Tower, was holding Ancient God Eye, standing on top of the ocean. He turned around and looked at Star Tower, saying, “Teacher, the united forces alliance is making a last -struggle. We need to capture as many universe masters as possible. I’ll go use Star Tower.”

“We have more than a100 universe masters here. We don’t need Star Tower,” Primal Chaos City Leader urged. “Go and capture those universe masters.”

“Okay.”

Mosha Luo Feng waved his hand, and Star Tower shrank and fell into his hands.

“Go!”

Mosha body reached light speed and entered the dark universe, trying to capture the universe masters as quickly as possible.

…

“Larger! Larger! Larger!” A giant silver snake was swimming in the endless ocean, enlarging itself.

Dream Demon Ancestor controlled the true treasure palace. However, when the pinnacle true treasure tried to enlarge itself, it was suppressed by the godly power ocean and couldn’t get larger! It put back his true treasure palace and showed its original body. Its godly body became larger. The ocean’s binding power couldn’t match that of universe supreme master Dream Demon Ancestor. It couldn’t enlarge itself infinitely.

Without restraint, it could enlarge itself like Star Tower. However, if it was confined to a small area, and area would decide how much it could bulge. If it was in a cave on an ordinary planet, it could easily become larger and crash through the resistance! However, in a room in Boat of Mausoleum, even a supreme true treasure couldn’t break through it.

When Luo Feng was encircled by the universe supreme masters in Universe Ocean, of Mausoleum had been devoured by the eternal true god of Divine Eye clan, yet it could still bulge and crash through that eternal true treasure! Ordinary supreme true treasures couldn’t do that.

“Damn godly power ocean.”

Northern Territory Alliance Master, Father God, Shock Demon Ancestor, and Virtual-Real Devil Master were all furious yet helpless. They couldn’t even control true treasure palaces, so they would rather control their own godly bodies. They all revealed their true bodies and started to grow larger.

Although the power of their bodies was stronger than Luo Feng’s godly power ocean, the ocean was performing Duan Mie; the resistance was still strong, and it was only slightly weak than them! Their godly bodies couldn’t be enlarged quickly enough. Generally, they could become ten billion kilometers long immediately, but at the moment, the rate was much slower—a million kilometers, ten million kilometers, 50 million kilometers, 100 million kilometers…

“Larger, larger, larger.” Bug Empress’s Empress Palace was becoming larger at a normal speed.

Empress Palace was a supreme true treasure, so it was strong enough. All the 12 giant objects were bulging, including Empress Palace and the original bodies of the 11 universe supreme masters. Those original bodies—whether they be a silver snake, a wicked giant, a beast, or a beauty—were all growing. 100 million kilometers, 500 million kilometers, a billion kilometers…

The ocean water tried to suppress the bodies, making them slower and slower. Empress Palace, however, was still fast and was already tens of billions of kilometers tall.

******

The human team watched the 12 giant objects becoming larger and larger in Remote Ocean water.

“They want to enlarge their godly bodies to draw closer to each other so that they can help the Freedom Alliance?” said Primal Chaos City Leader.

He watched the universe supreme masters from the united forces alliance growing. He waved his right hand, and an art valuable floated on the water, quickly becoming larger. A mountain, a lake, and a wooden house!

The mountain, the peaceful lake, and the wooden house floated on the tumbling godly power ocean, which confused all the universe masters from the other races. What was Primal Chaos City Leader doing?

One of Primal Chaos City Leader’s bodies appeared and walked to the mountain while another body walked to the lake.

Weng!

A green sky covered the godly power ocean, and gray land stretched out under it.

Hong!

The wooden house was like the center of the universe, gleaming and covering an area of one square light year! The green sky and the gray land were like two lids, combining into a universe whose center was the wooden house.

“What is this…?” The universe masters of other races felt a strong pressure as the endless light covered the entire area.

The 11 universe supreme masters and Empress Palace all slowed down immediately and sharply. Palm Universe and Five-Color Aurora Lake combined were dissipating the Golden Country of Luo Feng. After all, Golden Country overlapped with Palm Universe.

Palm Universe and Five-Color Aurora Lake. The two of them combined were so powerful that Xi Qu Starlight Lake was annihilated as well.

“What is that?”

“How can the humans have another valuable?”

“It’s a valuable for controlling space and time. It seems to be more powerful and wields even more pressure.”

Father God, Prison Race Devil Ancestor, Shock Demon Ancestor, and the other supreme masters were all nervous. They were struggling and burning their godly bodies, trying to become larger.

******

Shi Hua Island Leader started to transmit his voice to all the universe masters from Freedom Alliance. “Separate! Each team from the Freedom Alliance immediately broke into three or four teams, with each team carrying around 20 universe masters. They tried to run away separately! The human team only has Star Tower and Black Prison Tower, so they can’t be that efficient. Separate now so that the humans can’t capture many universe masters.”

Shi Hua Island Leader was already three billion kilometers tall and still trying to grow larger. He was in the Freedom Alliance, so he was closer to true treasure palaces belonging to the Freedom Alliance.

“Separate. Separate. Separate!”

One team from the Freedom Alliance was just captured while Shi Hua Island Leader protected another team. There were still four teams left. Their members started to split up. Each team had around 20 universe masters; some of them had bodies, so there were a bit more than 20 bodies.

The combination of those 20 godly bodies was already more powerful than top-tier level six, and it had reached level seven. Attacks at level seven could at least blast away the godly power ocean around them so they could fly slowly. If there had been fewer of them, they wouldn’t have been able to even move in the godly power ocean.

******

“Capture!”

Luo Feng and Darkness Master stared at the four true treasure palaces flying in four different directions.

“Swallow,” Darkness Master said and waved his hand. Black Prison Tower flew out, bulging, and starting to swallow.

Luo Feng frowned. “They are starting to disperse. It’s going to be harder.”

Those separated true treasure palaces flew slowly and were not far from each other. But even though they were not far, it would take more time. And with time flying by, the teams from the Freedom Alliance would be farther from each other.

Hong!

Ancient God Eye and Black Prison Tower combined, swallowed the green, boat-sized true treasure palace. The universe masters inside could do nothing to resist it.

******

“Capture! Capture! Capture!”

With Ancient God Eye and Black Prison Tower combined, the human team tried to capture as many true treasure palaces as possible.

With time going by, Shi Hua Island Leader was already eight billion kilometers tall. He reached his hands and grabbed a true treasure palace. “Come here!”

The universe masters inside the true treasure palace didn’t struggle; instead, they cheered, “Alliance master!”

Shi Hua Island Leader took it back easily.

******

“No!” said Luo Feng. “One of the true treasure palaces was taken by Shi Hua Island Leader.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He was getting nervous. Shi Hua Island Leader was the closest one to the palaces, so he was the first to act. There were other universe supreme masters in the united forces alliance, too. Empress Palace would enter the area soon.

“I’ll capture them as many as possible.”

Luo Feng stopped thinking.

On the human’s side, every possible asset was being utilized—the godly power ocean, Five-Color Aurora Lake, Palm Universe, Ancient God Eye, Star Tower, and Black Prison Tower. Luo Feng’s Remote Ocean was blocking those universe supreme masters and was also performing Duan Mie to maintain its maximum power. But it still took time to capture them.

******

Hong! Long! Long!

The largest object from the united forces alliance in Remote Ocean was Empress Palace, which was already 200 billion kilometers tall. Empress Palace was surrounded by godly power ocean winding around it, controlling the palace.

“That Luo Feng’s a handful!” Bug Empress said begrudgingly.

If Luo Feng’s godly power ocean hadn’t been winding around it, Empress Palace would have been ten times taller, and all the true treasure palaces from the Freedom Alliance would’ve been saved.

“Go!”

“Save us, Bug Empress!”

“Come in.”

“Come in.”

A long white arm extended out of the giant Empress Palace and grabbed the palace true treasures. The universe masters inside didn’t resist, making Bug Empress’s efforts much more effective.

******

Bug Empress and Shi Hua Island Leader were both trying to take as many true treasure palaces as possible.

As for Luo Feng, Darkness Master, and Mosha body, they were divided into two teams capturing the true treasure palaces.

Finally, other than the 11 giant godly bodies and the towering Empress Palace, there were no true treasure palaces from the united forces alliance left in Remote Ocean. Apparently, they had all been taken.

In the endless godly power ocean, Mosha body, Luo Feng’s original body, and Darkness Master stood side by side, checking on the universe masters they had captured. Darkness Master sighed. “We tried our best. Empress Palace is too large, and the universe masters from the Freedom Alliance cooperated with her. We’ve only captured 208 universe masters. Far fewer than I expected.”

He sighed again, but when he and Luo Feng exchanged eye contact, they couldn’t hold it back anymore.

“Hahaha…”

“Hahaha…!”

Luo Feng and Darkness Master started to guffaw, laughing recklessly with relief.

After this fight, nobody would be a threat to the humans anymore!
