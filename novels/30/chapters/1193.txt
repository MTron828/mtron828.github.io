Chapter 1194: Go to Road to Desperation Together

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In Hong Alliance City of the virtual universe, inside the main palace, many universe masters were gathered.

“I just heard it from the second universe incarnation era, but I don’t know whether it’s real or not.” Firestone master looked around. “Luo Feng helped me once. If he’s in danger…”

“It must be false,” said Void Gold Master, shaking his head. “Chaos and I went into Universe Boat together, and Chaos told Luo Feng not to get into the inner area. Besides, Luo Feng is relatively weak, and he shouldn’t be able to get into the inner area, not to mention God-Destroying Valley! And he’s certainly not powerful enough to fight Five Chaos Master.”

“Makes sense.”

“Yes.” The universe masters present all nodded.

Five Chaos Master from the first incarnation era was at the same level as Primal Chaos City Leader. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t panic first,” said Peng Gong Master. “I am related to some universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land. Let me ask them first.” Peng Gong Master smiled, and all of a sudden, all the universe masters looked to Peng Gong Master. Peng Gong Master was very low-key, yet he had a very high status.

Peng Gong Master gradually turned solemn. “I’ve confirmed it.” Peng Gong Master glanced around. “Luo Feng indeed got into the God-Destroying Valley of Universe Boat, and he fought Yin Tuo, Five Chaos Master, and Ultimate Arrow Master. And then Molten Lava Devil God showed up, which injured Yin Tuo like never before, and it forced Ultimate Arrow Master and Five Chaos Master to flee into Lava Ocean. Ultimate Arrow Master died while Five Chaos Master survived. However, he suffered a lot.”

“This…”

“Is this true?”

All the universe masters in the main palace were amazed. Ultimate Arrow died? Yin Tuo was severely injured? And Five Chaos was forced into Lava Ocean?

“Are you sure, Peng Gong?” Void Gold Master couldn’t help asking, as Ultimate Arrow Master was at his level.

“I am.” Peng Gong Master nodded. “I’ll call Chaos here.”

Primal Chaos City Leader was also thrilled when he learned the news. The first thing he did was summon Luo Feng.

“Come here, Luo Feng.”

Luo Feng showed up in the palace and looked around. “Teacher, Peng Gong Master, Void Gold Master, everyone…”

“Milky Way Horde Leader.”

“Milky Way Horde Leader,” everyone said with respect.

They kind of looked down on Luo Feng, as he was a new universe master. Yet after learning that he had caused Ultimate Arrow Master to die, had severely injured Yin Tuo, and had made Five Chaos Master go through Lava Ocean, they had nothing but respect for Luo Feng.

“Is it true?” said Primal Chaos City Leader.

“Yes.” Luo Feng nodded. “Yin Tuo was kicked twice by Molten Lava Devil God, and his Golden Sulphone Armor might have been broken. As for Yin Tuo himself, he might not have much of his godly body left.”

“As for Ultimate Arrow Master, his Core of Blade Sector fell in the hands of Five Chaos Master. He’s dead now.”

“As for Five Chaos Master, he might have lost dearly going through Lava Ocean.”

Luo Feng told the story directly, yet the universe masters present were all thrilled.

“How about you?” asked Primal Chaos City Leader.

“I can only go through Lava Ocean as well,” said Luo Feng.

Immediately, the universe masters were all worried. Going through Lava Ocean? Does he still want to live?

“I arrived at Blazing Water Lake, yet I’m being chased by Sealed Huller Master, Pan Ke Master, You Ya Master, and that Five Chaos Master…” said Luo Feng. “I’m running for my life, yet teacher summoned me.”

“Four? Sealed Huller Master? Five Chaos Master?” Primal Chaos City Leader held his breath.

Luo Feng nodded.

“What can you do now?” Primal Chaos City Leader frowned. “You’re in Blazing Water Lake, and it’ll take me decades to get there. Huge Axe Creator is in Tilted Peak Sector. Who will go there to rescue you?”

Void Gold Master shook his head. “There’s no time.”

Peng Gong Master frowned.

Luo Feng said directly, “Relax, teacher. That Five Chaos Master won’t stop until he kills me… I might just sacrifice my original body, and I won’t hold back. They’re chasing me, so I can’t be distracted. I’ll go first.”

Luo Feng bowed and disappeared.

“Won’t stop?” Primal Chaos City Leader and Peng Gong Master were quite concerned, yet they couldn’t do anything.

“Impressive.”

As for other universe masters—especially the universe masters from the races other than the human race—were all thrilled. It was already impressive enough for him to indirectly kill Ultimate Arrow Master, and now, he was fighting Five Chaos Master? Even Sealed Huller Master from Purple Moon Holy Land? It was crazy. They normally didn’t dare to mess with Sealed Huller Master and Five Chaos Master.

“Just run, Luo Feng!” Five Chaos Master roared. “Let’s see how far you can run. How am I supposed to adventure in Universe Ocean if I don’t kill you? You’re dead! Dead!”

“Dead!” said Luo Feng. “Stop talking and do something!”

Luo Feng was charging—flying the highest. Pan Ke Master and You Ya Master were closest to him, less than 100 million kilometers beneath him, and with their speed 100 times faster than light speed, they could reach him in several seconds.

Five Chaos Master and Sealed Huller Master were dashing toward him from another direction. They were relatively far away from Luo Feng. Five Chaos Master was 100 billion kilometers away, and Sealed Huller Master was even farther away.

Hua!

The higher it was, the colder it got. Frozen Lake Fire was on the top.

There were flames in the deep of the sky, where Frozen Lake Fire had existed for an eternity. Sometimes, there would be ripples, and they would sometimes hit Blazing Water Lake, which froze the entire Blazing Water Lake.

“It’s Frozen Lake Fire at the top!”

“It’s been several days, and it’s Frozen Lake Fire up there. Why does that Luo Feng keep flying higher? Frozen Lake Fire is extremely cold, and even top-tier palace type true treasures will crack. It seems that he has a pinnacle palace type true treasure.”

Shua!

Luo Feng went into his Crimson Pyramid, and he went into the Frozen Lake Fire in that Crimson Pyramid.

“Come in, You Ya.” Pan Ke Master took out a silver ball where there were complex engravings, and they went into it.

The silver ball went into that Frozen Lake Fire as well.

After a while…

“Went into Frozen Lake Fire? You won’t be able to run away!” The eyes of Five Chaos Master glinted with madness. Then his Extermination Godly Armor was dismantled, and Five Beast God was formed. He was inside Five Beast God and controlling it, and he went into Frozen Lake Fire as well.

After a while, Sealed Huller Master also entered Frozen Lake Fire in a pinnacle palace type true treasure.

Pan Ke Master and You Ya Master were both confused.

“So weird.”

“Luo Feng is slowing down.”

“Indeed, he is. So weird.”

“Sealed Huller, Luo Feng slowed down.”

“Just follow him,” answered Sealed Huller Master. “It’s the Road to Desperation in the front, so he won’t be able to make it.”

******

Luo Feng slowed down. Pan Ke Master and You Ya Master knew they weren’t able to do anything to Luo Feng, so they slowed down as well. On the contrary, Five Chaos Master and Sealed Huller Master were moving forward at their fastest speed.

Slow and fast. Five Chaos Master got closer and closer to Luo Feng. 60 billion kilometers, 50 billion kilometers, 40 billion kilometers… 10 billion kilometers, 5 billion, 1 billion, 100 million…

“You’re asking for death, Luo Feng. If I don’t kill you, it’ll be a waste.”

Luo Feng slowed down and transmitted his voice through Golden Country. “Five Chaos, how persistent of you to chase me for so long,” said Luo Feng. “Do you know where it is in the front?”

“It’s the Road to Desperation,” answered Five Chaos Master.

“It is,” said Luo Feng. “It’s the Twelve Abysses in front.”

There was Frozen Lake Fire at the top of Blazing Water Lake, and it came from the Twelve Abysses. The Twelve Abysses were twelve endless spaces, six of which were bursting out endless Frozen Lake Fire. As for the other six, they kept swallowing the fire. Hence, they formed a circle. Once the explosive power was stronger than the gravitational power, the Frozen Lake Fire would touch Blazing Water Lake.

The abyss was the Road to Desperation!

For one thing, there weren’t other exits but the abyss. Also, only universe supreme masters could survive it, and even universe masters with supreme true treasures didn’t dare enter.

“Abyss…” said Luo Feng.

He flew to the top, and Frozen Lake Fire formed a huge whirlpool. There was a massive black hole, and Luo Feng was only able to defend against its gravitational power using Star Tower and Golden Country.

“Are you trying to scare me?” said Five Beast God. “Humph! The closer it gets to the abyss, the more powerful the gravitational power will be. And the gravitational power you’re able to withstand is weaker than what I can withstand. You’re dead!” Five Beast God dashed at Luo Feng like a beam of light.

Luo Feng looked up at the abyss, which was a place more terrifying than Lava Ocean. He wouldn’t be able to get out.

“Don’t regret it if you keep following me,” said Luo Feng.

“Haha, you’ll be the one who’ll regret it,” Five Beast God roared, and the claws already hit the Crimson Pyramid.

“I’m not your match, so…” whispered Luo Feng.

Hong! Long!

Miniature Universe was formed. It enveloped Five Chaos Master and Luo Feng. The Miniature Universe wasn’t able to resist that gravitational power whatsoever, and it didn’t even try. It was sucked into that abyss. Miniature Universe crumbled under that swallowing power. Five Chaos Master was struggling, but it was already too late.

“No!” Five Chaos Master was terrified and tried to fly back.

Luo Feng’s voice resounded around Five Chaos Master: “It’s my honor to go to the Road to Desperation with Five Chaos Master.”

******

Silence.

A silver ball appeared outside the abyss, and after a short while, a palace appeared as well.

“Maniac, maniac!” Pan Ke Master and You Ya Master were both shocked.

That was the Road to Desperation. Even universe masters with supreme true treasures didn’t dare enter it.

“That Silver Wing Horde Leader is so crazy,” said Sealed Huller Master. “He’s crazy with others and also with himself.”

Sealed Huller Master stared at that abyss, and he knew that Five Chaos Master was doomed! He suddenly realized how wrong it was for him to try to seize Luo Feng’s valuables.

“Luckily, he went to Five Chaos instead of me.” Sealed Huller Master felt lucky.
