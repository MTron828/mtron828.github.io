Chapter 1446: The Final Insanity of Morosa

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Change!”

Luo Feng’s blood, flesh, skin, and the structures deeper that were constituting his life started to change, and soon later, his skin became dark, and there was black mist surrounding his body. At the same time. Another head appeared on his head, and each head had a single bloody eye. It was permeating wicked forces, and it was definitely a Sector Beast!

The forces coming from it were definitely the forces of Sector Beasts!

Luo Feng had already reached the legendary level of 100,000 times, which was sheer perfection! Also, it had the characteristics of Sector Beasts and universe masters, true gods, and true gods of void space. Two different lineages were combined in the same body.

The negative side and the positive side usually neutralized each other. However, Luo Feng had reached the peak and was able to merge the two sides, reaching perfection! He was able to permeate godly power. However, if he deliberately altered the force, he was able to easily transform all the energies in his body to an opposite energy: “the power of Sector Beasts.” Certainly, that was the only thing he could do. As for the “colorful portal,” the “separation of bodies,” and the skill to breed endless warriors, Luo Feng didn’t have any of those. He was only able to transform the energies; he couldn’t change his soul!

******

There were one billion Sector Beasts in total, and while they had high life gene levels, they weren’t at the perfect level of 100,000 times. Only the king was perfect. Although Sector Beasts could simulate the force on the surface, they weren’t able to convert their energies into godly power completely.

If they were really able to convert the energies, there would have been no need for them to be afraid of Nine Remoteness True Master.

Even though they had slightly lower life gene levels than Luo Feng, they were born for destruction. From level one, level two, level three, level four… they kept evolving and getting stronger. The final king of Sector Beasts would be at the same level as the original universe, which was a level Luo Feng could never attain.

After all, Luo Feng was only a creature born inside the original universe. No matter how great he was, he couldn’t compare to Sector Beasts.

Sector Beasts were bred by Universe Ocean, standing in opposition to the original universe!

Converting his energy into the force of Sector Beasts was only one of the skills. “Invisible and Formless” also meant Luo Feng was able to perfectly hide his life force. His diagram of life structure was perfect, which was why he could perfectly hide it. Plus, he was also able to alter his force and imitate other forces!

“Change!” Luo Feng immediately changed. He turned into Sector Beast Morosa, emanating the same force as Morosa. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Change!” Luo Feng became Primal Chaos City Leader, having the same life force.

“Change!” Luo Feng became Nine Remoteness True Master.

“Change!” Luo Feng became Blood Orchid Ancestor.

“Change!” Luo Feng became a spaceship, Boat of Mausoleum, even emanating the same force of the valuable.

“Change!” Luo Feng became a floating rock in the space, with the same force.

He had the perfect diagram of structure, and he was able to turn into flesh and blood, metal, and plant life forms with the same force. It meant that Luo Feng could turn into any great being or any object.

Of course, when it came to those that were too special—like His Majesty the Godly King from Jin Country—the willpower contained within couldn’t be duplicated by Luo Feng. He was able to turn into anyone and anything within his limit.

“Incredible. Much more incredible than the limitless godly body and flexible sizes of bodies.”

Luo Feng was thrilled. At the third level of godly body, one had a limitless godly body and a flexible size. However, compared to “Invisible and Formless,” after reaching perfection, it was still inferior.

Of course, this ability was not invincible.

If I am locked in place, then it will be useless, Luo Feng thought.

If he were trapped in a “single thought void space,” no matter how he changed, his enemies would be able to see him changing, so he wouldn’t be able to get away.

No matter how powerful an ability was, there were weaknesses. Even Sector Beasts had weaknesses, not to mention Luo Feng.

******

While Luo Feng rejoiced to discover the ability he had after his life gene level reached 100,000 times, Sector Beast Morosa met Nine-Headed Demon Master again.

“These were what happened when you disappeared, my king,” said Nine-Headed Demon Master respectfully.

“Did you leave out anything?” Morosa gazed at Nine-Headed Demon Master with his two singular eyes.

“No.” Nine-Headed Demon Master shook his head.

Morosa waved his claws. “Go.”

Nine-Headed Demon Master bowed, teleported, and disappeared.

Morosa stood in the space of chaos air, and the air was surrounding him. He stood still, sometimes looking furious, sometimes looking reluctant, sometimes looking mad.

“Milky Way Horde Leader.”

Both of the singular eyes of Morosa glinted with insanity. “I can’t kill you, and I have no chance to become the king anymore. But I’ll make you regret what you did.”

Luo Feng at true-god level made Morosa desperate. He felt like an ant facing a mountain. If it could become the king of Sector Beasts, it could definitely kill Luo Feng. However, even in the nest of Sector Beasts, it was a weakling who would be crushed by the others. Back in the nest, it would be killed… It was better for him to behave insanely and perhaps successfully get his revenge.

“No matter what, I’ll give all your information to Beddy and the others. Hahaha…”

Morosa immediately started to send the message. All the Sector Beasts were able to use telepathy, and they could send their messages to each other naturally.

“Beddy, and other idiots! I am the great Morosa! Aren’t you all trying to kill me? Unfortunately, none of you are qualified to kill me… I, Morosa, will die very soon. The one who is going to kill me is the most powerful great being in Universe Ocean. The human, Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng!

“Remember this name: Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng! He’s powerful beyond all your imagination. When he was only a universe master, he was able to overpower all the other true gods and was already the number one great being in Universe Ocean. When he was fighting me, he was at such a great advantage that I couldn’t resist him at all, and I could only flee. I went back to level one from level three because of him… Beddy, even you’re not his match. And now, he has already become a true god! He’s only going to get more powerful, and I can’t even imagine how powerful he is now. If it’s a one-to-one battle, even if you are at pinnacle level four now, you’ll be killed by him, Beddy… All you idiots must fight him together—or consume each other to give birth to level-five Sector Beasts or higher.

“Fight and kill each other, and let the final king be born! Remember, beware of Milky Way Horde Leader. Don’t let him destroy the Sector Beasts! Beddy! Haha! You failed to kill me after all.”

The message was spread.

The eyes of Morosa gleamed all the more madly, as it wasn’t afraid of death anymore. Now that its message had been sent, the Sector Beasts would start to prepare for everything now.

“Haha… Milky Way Horde Leader, this is only the first gift for you. I have a second gift…” Morosa in instantly teleported and disappeared.

******

In the core area of one of the three Lands of Extremis, in Tilted Peak Sector, in the Land of Darkness, was the hive of Sector Beasts.

Every Sector Beast received the message sent by Morosa, and it shocked all the Sector Beasts in the hive. They hadn’t realized that the life forms in Universe Ocean, which they treated as food, could give birth to such a terrific creature.

“The one who knocked Morosa back to level one was only a universe master.”

“Milky Way Horde Leader?”

“Now that he’s a true god…”

“Is he really more powerful than Beddy?”

All the Sector Beasts everywhere in the hive immediately remembered Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng.

Si! La!

The ferocious Sector Beast known as “Beddy,” who was swallowing flesh and blood endlessly, suddenly raised both of its heads. Black blood dripped from the edges of its lips. The dying Sector Beast was yelling, “Did you hear that, Beddy? Even you’ll be killed by that Milky Way Horde Leader if you meet him. You’ll die! You’ll die as well!”

Ka! Cha!

Beddy opened its mouth abruptly and swallowed half of the head of the dying Sector Beast. Its eyes were cold.

“Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng?” Beddy whispered the name.

One miniature universe after another was located outside the original universe, and they floated around the original universe. They belonged to the true gods from the original universe, so they were all very close to it.

These miniature universes were all very safe. They were all connected to the original universe through universe portals, so even if they were swallowed by the Sector Beasts, the true gods from the original universe could arrive as soon as possible to fight them by following the universe portals.

Morosa had never attacked the miniature universes of the true gods that belonged to the original universe era.

Hua!

The chaos air trembled. A black, ugly being showed up in space. Morosa was staring at the miniature universe in the distance. He muttered, “This? Is this the miniature universe of the greatest and the first leader of the human race, ‘Teacher Origin’? It seems to be called the primal universe… Teacher Origin is completely suppressed, and he isn’t even able to control his own miniature universe. He can’t even drive it to morph, which is why it remains at the primal status. And without Teacher Origin to control it, that means his small universe doesn’t have his willpower to guard it.” Morosa was looking forward to it. “Which means it’ll be the most efficient to swallow his miniature universe.”

Swallowing the origin of a miniature universe depended, for one thing, on the level of the miniature universe. The more advanced a miniature universe was, the more resistant it was.

For another thing, the willpower of the true god also mattered. When Morosa had swallowed Purple Moon Holy Land, he had been able to eat it quickly. However, when Purple Moon Ancestor had utilized his willpower to guard it, the holy land had become much more resistant.

I should be able to eat the miniature universe of Teacher Origin much faster than others, Morosa thought. Let it begin. If I can swallow the universe of the earliest leader of the human race, will Luo Feng and the humans lose their minds?

Morosa expected as much.
