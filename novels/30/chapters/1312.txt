Chapter 1314: Hu Yan Bo

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The war among the top beings from almost all the superpowers in the original universe was over, yet the ordinary life forms didn’t know anything about it. Lower-tier wars would be catastrophic to them, yet the war among the top beings didn’t affect them at all. Of course, if one side lost, the beings in their territories would be ruthlessly slaughtered.

The united forces didn’t win. The human team didn’t lose. This was how the war had ended!

It could have been foreseen that the two teams would keep fighting each other for a long time. Unless one side was absolutely confident that they could crush the other side, such a large-scale war wouldn’t happen again.

******

Hu Yan Bo had died, and Yun Mo Star had been destroyed! However, since Babata had become undying, he had rebuilt Yun Mo Star quickly, taking back the power area that had previously belonged to Hu Yan Bo before (except for the area around Earth).

Purple stars shone their light upon Yun Mo Star through dark clouds. On Earth were warriors gathered from all kinds of planets; they were trained strictly on the planet, while warriors most loyal to the master of Yun Mo Star would be chosen from among these candidates.

“Come at me, idiots from A Luo Star!” a giant being roared at the camp opposite to him. “I’m right here waiting! Come if you can!”

The giant had a red horn on his forehead. He stood just outside the camp. The members of the opposite side were irritated. Someone tried to rush out, but they were pulled back.

“What a maniac! Are you suicidal?”

A voice came from the camp. “Don’t worry about that maniac.”

“Hahaha, wahaha…” The single-horned giant man was reckless. “Idiots from A Luo Star, you are cowards! You’ll be cowards before me forever.”

A being appeared in the sky. He wore a casual, silver-white cape as he floated in the sky. He looked down and whispered, “Is this how Yun Mo Star looked like before it was destroyed? Babata spent so much time rebuilding it. It seems Hu Yan Bo does have a strong impact on him.” Then Luo Feng kept flying.

He flew relaxedly. Neither the security guards nor the other means of detection spotted him. Some warriors flew past in front of him, but they didn’t notice him either. This was what true control over space and time meant.

He flew for a while as he wanted to observe Yun Mo Star, and it took him a while to arrive above a black castle.

Luo Feng looked down and shouted, “Babata!”

******

On the throne inside the palace sat a child in a black cape. He had two antennae on his forehead and red eyes. His face was chubby. He may have looked cute, but the female servants from other planets who were performing down there knew how terrifying he was.

“Babata!” said a voice.

“Huh?” The black-caped child raised his head.

Shua!

He teleported and disappeared.

******

In the sky above the black castle, the silver-caped form of Luo Feng stood in the sky, and a black-caped child appeared beside him.

The black-caped child looked at Luo Feng and shouted, “Master!”

“You seem pretty relaxed,” Luo Feng chuckled. “But it seems you’re still practicing hard. You can teleport now.”

“The resources you provided, and the path you suggested…” said Babata. “Even the most mediocre can become undying, not to mention someone smart like me.”

The ordinary class didn’t know about that war, but Babata was undying and had been summoned to the primal universe before. The undying fighters had come back only after the war had ended. Besides, everyone in Primal Chaos City was talking about the war. Although they didn’t know the details, they had heard that Luo Feng was one of the top performers.

“Let’s go to the outer space of Yun Mo Star,” said Luo Feng.

“Why?” Babata was confused.

“I’m going to resurrect Hu Yan Bo,” said Luo Feng.

Babata’s body shook, as he couldn’t control his emotions.

Luo Feng sighed in his heart. Babata was, after all, closer to Hu Yan Bo. There was still some distance between him and Babata. For one thing, Babata had called Luo Feng by his name at first, but as Luo Feng grew stronger, Babata had started to revere him and call him “Master.”

How could he not be in awe of Luo Feng? Luo Feng was one of the top beings in the human race—even in the entire original universe.

On the contrary, Babata and Hu Yan Bo had been through countless life-and-death battles, and they had spent an eternity going on adventures through the universe. Babata had been with Hu Yan Bo ever since becoming an intelligent life form. It was not difficult to imagine how close they had been.

“Okay,” said Babata with thrill. “Let’s go to outer space.”

Luo Feng nodded, took Babata, and disappeared.

******

In the outer space of Yun Mo Star, Luo Feng, wearing his silver cape, stood outside the atmosphere while Babata stood beside him, looking worried.

“Watch closely,” said Luo Feng. “Up!”

Luo Feng looked around the space in front of him. With a thought, time in the area started to turn back. The scenes were rewound, including the scene when Yun Mo Star had been rebuilt and the scene when Yun Mo Star had been attacked and destroyed—Luo Feng controlled time and accelerated the rewinding.

“Huh?” Luo Feng stopped.

The triangular Yun Mo Star spaceship appeared. There were beings inside it.

“Is it this one, Babata?” asked Luo Feng.

With a thought, the beings inside Yun Mo Star spaceship appeared. A handsome man showed up at the front of the control room in the spaceship, and beings were standing behind him, including Babata!

“Wu Za, Wu Xia…” Babata couldn’t stop trembling, and he shouted at Luo Feng, “Yes, it’s them! It’s them.”

Luo Feng was surprised. Babata was, indeed, closer to Hu Yan Bo and his servants. He decided to resurrect those soul slaves as well, to show his gratitude to Babata and Hu Yan Bo. Hu Yan Bo’s help seemed tiny now, but it was highly influential to him.

“Freeze!” Luo Feng moved his mind. It locked Yun Mo space, Hu Yan Bo, and his nine soul slaves! Everyone was frozen in place. “Turn back time!”

Luo Feng let the time go back to the original.

It was like a spring bouncing back! Luo Feng didn’t have to endure any burden if he decided not to save anyone, but there would be a price to pay if he wanted to bring back lives by taking them from the past to the present. The punishment was actually for Hu Yan Bo and his nine soul slaves, yet Luo Feng was the one who bore it, as they couldn’t. To Luo Feng, it was easy for him to revive universe knights, not to mention some undying fighters.

After a while, Yun Mo spaceship floated in the sky. Apparently, Lu Feng had even brought back Yun Mo Star spaceship from that time. If a being was still alive, he couldn’t bring it back. As for objects, however, they could be brought back even if they still existed. For example, an existing true treasure could be duplicated by bringing one from the past when turning back time. The punishment for this, however, would be horrifying. It would cost more to bring back a single true treasure than to get ten new true treasures.

Of course, the punishment for bringing back Yun Mo Star spaceship was nothing to Luo Feng. After all, Yun Mo Star spaceship wasn’t even a treasure.

Hua!

The door opened, and a handsome man in a black cape strolled excitedly through the doorway. He took a step and walked into the space. Undying fighters behind him walked out one by one as well. They all looked excited and nervous.

The handsome, black-caped man looked at Luo Feng, then noticed black-caped child beside him. “Babata!” he yelled.

“Big brother!” Babata couldn’t help it anymore. He teleported to beside the handsome man, Hu Yan Bo, and hugged him. This man was both like a big brother and a father to him. “Big brother, big brother, big brother…” Babata kept shouting as he embraced Hu Yan Bo, and his voice showed how much he had missed Hu Yan Bo.

Luo Feng looked in the distance and sighed. Babata was indeed close with Hu Yan Bo.

Hu Yan Bo and his nine slaves were all dazed. They all had the memories from the past, so they all knew that they had died… Yet they had been brought back now!

A universe master turned back time and revived them? How?

What dazed them more was Babata, who had previously only been an intelligent life form, had teleported to them!

“Teleportation? Babata, you—you’re undying now?” said an ape-shaped undying life form standing behind Hu Yan Bo.

“Yes.” Babata nodded. “With the help of my master, Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng. I’m an undying emperor now, and I can teleport.”

“Milky Way Horde Leader?”

Hu Yan Bo and his soul slaves were all bewildered. Of course, they knew Milky Way! Hu Yan Bo had a land in the Milky Way, yet they had never heard of any “horde leader.” They hadn’t expected a Milky Way Horde Leader to be here after being resurrected, and they couldn’t imagine that Babata—who had previously been an intelligent life form—was an undying emperor stronger than all of them now. After all, Hu Yan Bo was only an official.

“How long have we been dead? Ten million years? 100 million years?” Hu Yan Bo couldn’t help asking. “And who is this Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng?”

“Milky Way Horde Leader is one of the top beings in the human race, and he’s also one of the supreme beings in the original universe,” answered Babata. “It was Master Luo Feng who turned back time and resurrected you all. That is Master Luo Feng…” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He pointed at Luo Feng in the distance.

Hu Yan Bo and his slaves turned around to look at the silver-caped man standing in the distance. Their attention had been entirely on Babata. Until he pointed at Luo Feng, they hadn’t even realized he was standing there.

Hua!

The silver-caped man walked forward, which astounded Hu Yan Bo and his slaves. Amazing! This was a being who could turn back time! They were nothing in front of such a being.

“Teacher Hu Yan Bo,” said the silver-caped man.
