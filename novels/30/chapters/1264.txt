Chapter 1266: The War is Coming!

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“All universe knights and emperors—enter Demon Ancestor Universe!” The two demon ancestors gave an order.

The war started!

All these emperors and universe knights could be future universe masters, so they couldn’t be put at risk. As for those domain lords and sector lords, it would be difficult to say whether there would be a universe knight, so even if a lot of them were killed, a new group would be born in the near future.

In the virtual space of the demon race… FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Shock Horn, I’ll lead this time!” said the giant silver snake. “You’ll guard our race.”

“Okay,” said the strange beast with the serrated shell. “The bug race and the automaton race only have one universe supreme master, respectively, so you’ll be enough! Take my keepsake. If something goes wrong, I’ll be there as soon as possible.”

“Okay.”

******

At the same place, Shock Demon Ancestor and Dream Demon Ancestor looked at the 12 great beings in front of them.

Dream Demon Ancestor said, “This was it about the foundation of the human race. I’ll lead and protect all of you! However, you 12 should be divided into four teams of three, and when it’s critical, two teams should cooperate, or all of you shall cooperate with each other… To sum things up, you should make sure that you’re safe. What you need to do is to assist me! I’ll be the center of this war.”

“Yes, Demon Ancestor.”

All the universe masters were excited.

The union of three races—they just wanted to destroy the entire human race. The 12 of them combined already dared to approach the human race, not to mention when they were led by Dream Demon Ancestor.

Dream Demon Ancestor gave the order: “Go!”

******

In the territory of bug race, far away, a purple oval a trillion kilometers tall was floating in the sky. There were twisted engravings on the purple oval like the arteries and veins of a human.

Hu!

A streak of light flew toward the purple oval and flew in along a crack. Then another streak of light flew in the purple oval.

“Empress!”

Inside the beautiful palace in the huge purple oval, the six bug clan queens wearing gauze coats all saluted the bug clan Empress on the throne.

The bug clan Empress looked down and said, “We must get the inheritance from Duan Dong River. If we succeed, we can transcend incarnations! You six will all stay in my nest and lead the warriors to fight. You’ve prepared fully for this fight. Although there are only six of them, you’ll be as powerful as the 20 or even 30 universe masters of the demon race and automaton race if you cooperate with each other well.”

“The demon race and automaton race can’t compare to us,” said a bug clan queen. “If the war is a group effort, we’ll be at a huge advantage. We also use our storage and will stay in our Empress’s nest. We don’t need to worry about our safety. Instead, we just need to utilize all our power.”

“If we attack at the same time and attack only one universe master, even if he doesn’t die, he’ll be stunned and sealed.”

“That’s right.”

“If we cooperate with each other, we can reach the limit of the original universe.”

All six bug race queens were confident.

“Then we shall let the humans see how powerful our race is,” Empress chuckled. “Let’s go!”

Her smile was breathtaking, but it was cruel and ruthless.

******

Inside the automaton universe…

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

A towering being made of steel teleported into the area and flew toward that black oval.

“Father God!”

“Father God!”

“Father God!”

The willpower was spread.

“Let’s go to the original universe. To the human territory!” said the black oval, and the metal beings all answered and flew into the portal.

******

The demon race, the bug race, and the automaton race were very fast. Within the same day that the prison race spread the news, they started to act.

The human race was on high alert.

******

Primal Chaos City in the primal universe.

At this time, Primal Chaos City had become the real center of the human race. Darkness Master, Peng Gong Master, and Luo Feng were all there.

“Brother, Peng Gong, Luo Feng! Come now!” A voice resounded at three different corners in Primal Chaos City. At the three corners lived Luo Feng, Darkness Master, and Peng Gong Master.

Luo Feng opened his eyes. “It’s begun?” he whispered.

Sou!

A teleportation.

In the main palace, three beings showed up after teleporting. They looked at each other first, then at Primal Chaos City Leader.

“Chaos, is the news leaked?” asked Darkness Master.

Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “The news has just spread. Besides, Teacher Origin told me that his virtual universe has already detected the demon race, the automaton race, and the bug race. There will be supreme beings coming at us. We need to prepare ourselves.”

“Teacher Origin?” Luo Feng, Darkness Master and Peng Gong Master all looked surprised.

“I’ve never told you.” Primal Chaos City Leader said. “The virtual universe of Teacher Origin covers the entire original universe! Unless some universe masters given orders that are strictly enforced, the virtual universe covers almost everywhere—other than rare areas like original stars! As long as the virtual universe covers it, Teacher Origin himself is watching!”

“Ah!”

Luo Feng, Darkness Master, and Peng Gong Master looked joyful. They were happy to learn what Teacher Origin could do. What made it even better was that it would be like monitoring the entire warzone. Besides, he was monitoring the entire original universe.

“Even if universe supreme masters act and repel the virtual universe,” said Primal Chaos City Leader, “Teacher Origin will be able to tell which area it is, and he can tell where the universe supreme master is.”

“Okay.”

They all nodded.

“The news was just spread. The three races will need time to arrange everything, but it won’t take long,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “You three will be the major fighting forces this time! Act now! There are still some pinnacle true treasures in our race. If you need them, just apply to use them.”

“Oh?” Luo Feng, Darkness Master and Peng Gong Master were kind of surprised.

“I need a pinnacle domain type true treasure.” Luo Feng smiled. “However, I’ll trade it for my pinnacle palace type true treasure.”

“I’ll need an illusion true treasure.” Darkness Master nodded.

“Okay, let’s act now. I’ll tell the other universe masters,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Then the other three universe masters will be divided into three teams and will follow you. They’ll assist you. Perhaps they’re not powerful individually, but when they cooperate with each other, they’ll be of great help.”

Luo Feng and the others nodded and left.

******

During the inheritance of Duan Dong River, lots of great beings of the Divine Eye clan died, and the Boat of Mausoleum had gained some pinnacle true treasures. There was one pinnacle soul type true treasure! However, there weren’t any pinnacle domain type true treasures, so he got it from the storage within the race.

“Most of the valuables were left by Huge Axe Creator.” Luo Feng sighed.”Shi Wu Wing has three pairs now. Although they’re merged, the power isn’t stronger. I’ll just separate them.”

Luo Feng had already had a plan. The first two pairs would be carried by his original earthling body so that it could perform Golden Country, and with a pinnacle domain type true treasure, space binding would be fully utilized.

As for the white wing, Golden Horned Beast would be carrying it. After all, the white wing was used as blades. It was already powerful enough. When Nirvana Renaissance was performed with it, it would be incredible.

******

Luo Feng, Darkness Master, and Peng Gong Master had soon gathered in the main palace, and there were 12 universe masters this time.

“The 12 will be divided into three teams and follow you three,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “The team of Void Gold Master will follow Peng Gong Master; the team of Qing Dong Master will follow Darkness Master; the team of Ice Mountain Master will follow Luo Feng. Go prepare first. If the three races do anything, I’ll notify you immediately.”

“Okay.”

“I can’t wait.”

All the universe masters were belligerent. Humans were very proud.

They wanted to fight humans? Let them come!

“Luo Feng, stay here first,” said Primal Chaos City Leader.

Everyone left.

Primal Chaos City Leader said to Luo Feng, “Are you sure about the power of the Golden Horned Beast?”

“Confirmed.” Luo Feng nodded. “When he uses all his power, he can rival a universe supreme master. Compared to other universe supreme masters, he’s just not fast enough! Of course, he can’t fight as long as other universe supreme masters! However, I have lots of protection on him.”

Golden Horned Beast had Star Tower and the white wing, both of which were supreme true treasures! And the godly blood on the white wing was terrific. The fighting power of Golden Horned Beast was, indeed, incredible.

“Okay.” Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “Don’t tell anyone about this body. This time, you, Darkness, and Peng Gong will be the major fighting powers. As for this Golden Horned body, it’ll be a safety net.”

“Okay.” Luo Feng nodded.

“Go now,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Once something happens, I’ll let you know. But I bet it’ll be today.”
