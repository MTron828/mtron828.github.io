Chapter 1395: The Killer Trap of Purple Moon Holy Land

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Within the military camp of the East Army, where Python River Army was stationed, Luo Feng was leisurely flying in the sky above the lake as he passed by it to head toward his own island.

On an island beneath Luo Feng, two warriors were in the midst of a conversation when they raised their heads and saw him flew by.

“Look, it’s Milky Way.”

“He is Milky Way? I heard the captains of the six troops are all afraid of that Milky Way.”

Warrior Milky Way had made his way back to the military camp, and news spread rapidly within the sixth troop under the first main team of Python River Army.

“Warrior Milky Way from your sixth troop is back? My friend has heard of his name from way back then and would like to get acquainted with him.”

“He just got back to his own island.”

A red-faced warrior from the third troop of the first main team of Python River Army made a brief tour and soon caught wind of the news that Warrior Milky Way had returned. It was common knowledge that it was impossible for warriors within the military camp to spend all their time only on cultivation. Making friends and sparring with others were also extremely important, especially for warriors from special army troops who were highly reputable. Many great beings would be more than willing to befriend such warriors because warriors of this caliber had high chances of becoming true gods of void space.

The red-faced warrior quickly left the military camp of Python River Army and headed for the military grounds of another special army troop.

“Cheng Mu! Cheng Mu!”

The red-faced warrior looked down as he sent out a voice transmission that swept through the vast expanse of forest beneath him.

From a huge wooden house constructed entirely of numerous large, sturdy trees, a double-faced, four-armed man flew out. He was clad in a suit of cyan armor and raised his head to look. The moment he saw his visitor, he smiled and said, “Qu Hua, I was just about to go look for you, and here you are. I just cooked something delicious. Come and try it.”

“Cheng Mu.” The red-faced warrior dashed down from where he was. “Haven’t you been looking for that warrior Milky Way from our Python River Army?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Yes,” the green-armored man replied right away. Then he excitedly asked, “Is he back in camp?”

“Yes, he just got back not long ago,” the red-faced warrior replied with a smile.

The green-armored man revealed his delight. “I have long wanted to meet him, but whatever it is, nothing matters more than eating.”

“Good, good, good.” The red-faced warrior was suddenly filled with anticipation.

Universe Ocean, within Purple Moon Holy Land Universe.

In the palace hall, Purple Moon Ancestor sat in silence with his eyes closed as though he could just sit there for endless eras.

Beneath him, also in cross-legged positions, were various figures that took the form of either other bodies of gods or avatars sustained by godly powers. All of them were universe masters who had entered the World of Jin. Suddenly, from amongst them, a double-faced, four-armed man opened his eyes and shot to his feet.

“Ancestor!” the cyan-clothed man reported with great reverence, “I have received news that warrior Milky Way just returned to the military camp of the East Army. Right now, he is at Python River Army’s military grounds.”

The moment this was said, the other universe masters around him opened their eyes in shock.

“Huh?” Seated above them all, Purple Moon Ancestor opened his eyes. A trace of coldness flashed in his gaze as he looked down at the crowd beneath him. “If that is the case, then we shall all need to start preparing to act together.”

“Yes, Ancestor.”

The numerous universe masters beneath all responded positively to his orders.

******

Within the military camp of the East Army in the World of Jin, the universe masters of Purple Moon Holy Land who had joined the East Army were preparing for action.

Within Purple Moon Holy Land Universe.

A number of universe masters below started to speak up.

“Ancestor, it is confirmed. Luo Feng is indeed in the military grounds of the Python River Army.”

“Ancestor, we are already standing guard by the wormhole transportation point outside the military camp. The moment he comes out, we will all know right away.”

“Ancestor…”

“Very well.” Purple Moon Ancestor looked down and nodded with satisfaction. “Since this Luo Feng has already entered the military camp of the East Army, if we are to strike, we must make sure this one move will exterminate him. Cheng Mu… it’s up to you now.”

“Rest assured, Ancestor,” Cheng Mu Master replied deferentially.

Purple Moon Ancestor nodded in silence, but in his heart, he was silently saying, Luo Feng… even if you have the legendary inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River, so what? East Emperor, that old fellow! He is not qualified to vie with me, and you do not stand a chance in a fight against me either! Regardless of how impressive a talent you are, if dead, you are nothing more than useless.

*******

World of Jin, military camp of the East Army.

In the vast forest found within the land where the special army troop “Swan Queen Army” was stationed.

The red-faced warrior was incredibly carefree as he swayed about in the form of flowing light. “This is so delicious. I have never eaten anything so delicious before when I was in the tribe. If I could frequently enjoy such delicious fare, I would prefer to spend half the time I spend on cultivation on eating instead. Cheng Mu, the next time you create such a marvelous dish, do remember to call me.”

“That’s for sure.” Cheng Mu Master tilted his head and laughed.

After the red-faced warrior left, Cheng Mu Master’s expression suddenly became quite stern. “Are we going to activate the killer trap?”

Cheng Mu Master was feeling an intangible pressure. As a universe master who had made it into a special army troop, Purple Moon Ancestor had handed a heavy responsibility over to him.

“I have given up every hope for a future in the World of Jin just to see to your death, Luo Feng. And you… You should be proud of that.”

Cheng Mu Master’s heart was filled with resentment. He had long been familiar with the three most dangerous lands of Universe Ocean, but this World of Jin… Since the moment he first entered, he had been completely mesmerized. He truly did not want to leave.

However, the moment the deadly trap was activated, he, Cheng Mu, would no longer be able to come to the World of Jin again.

“Let’s begin.” Cheng Mu Master hesitated no further. Transforming into flowing light, he flew out.

The vast piece of forest was the military ground of the Swan Queen Army.

The Swan Queen Army was divided into two major groups. One consisted of law masters, and the other consisted of true gods. Both sides were completely isolated from one another. Right in the center of the military camp was a towering godly palace. Before the godly palace were a few guards. This godly palace was where the commander of the Swan Queen Army resided! Within the army, those who could assume commander positions of special army troops were all true gods of void space. Outside of the army, they would all have been overlords.

There were six guards before the godly palace. Two were true gods, and the other four were law masters.

“Stop.”

“Stop. This is the commander’s residence. Trespassing is prohibited.”

The moment Cheng Mu Master descended, he said, “I seek an audience with the commander regarding an important matter.”

“Warrior!” a true god guard shouted out. “You think our commander is someone you can meet so easily? Quickly take your leave.”

“I have something very urgent that needs to be brought to the commander’s attention,” Cheng Mu Master said with great urgency.

Seeing how persistent he was, the two true god guards could not help but look at one another as they hesitated. After all, this warrior who had come forth was also a fellow warrior of their Swan Queen Army.

“Let him in,” a cold voice resounded.

“Yes, Commander,” replied the two true gods standing guard outside the palace. The guards looked toward Cheng Mu Master. “Enter.”

Cheng Mu Master heaved a sigh of relief and entered the godly palace.

The palace seemed to be like a maze. The corridors were full of twists and turns, and there were chambers everywhere. Cheng Mu Master could only follow the path as he made his way forward.

After a short moment, Cheng Mu Master saw a garden. There were countless lovely flowers within the garden, and there was a beautiful lady with nine feathery tails that were green with a tinge of gold. There were exquisite feathers all over her head, but her face was so striking that it stole Cheng Mu Master’s breath away instantly.

“Is she the legendary Swan Queen?” Cheng Mu Master said to himself.

The Swan Queen Army had been created by this Swan Queen. To be able to establish a special army troop, one had to be a true god of void space. Over a long period of time, some true gods of void space might break through to become eternal true gods. So naturally, the true god of void space who was next in line would take over their place. However, a breakthrough was too difficult, so the majority of the true gods of void space would usually continue in their positions as commanders.

This was how it was like for this Swan Queen.

“Cheng Mu pays his respect to Commander,” Cheng Mu Master said, bowing deferentially.

“What matter could be pressing enough for you to come here to see me?” Swan Queen’s eyes were radiating green light as they gave Cheng Mu Master a once-over. “If you cannot tell me something that is really pressing, then you shall be dealt with the military way. You will be fed to my children.”

Cheng Mu Master showed no hint of fear. He replied right away, “Commander, I have chanced upon a big secret.”

“A big secret?” Swan Queen was still speaking in a casual manner.

“That warrior, Milky Way, from the sixth troop of Python River Army’s main team,” Cheng Mu Master said in a highly anxious manner. “He… He is actually from another powerful group from the outside world. He has snuck his way into our World of Jin. After I caught wind of this news, I was afraid that I would be annihilated. Thus, I did not dare to expose the truth. It was only after I returned to camp that I dared to report to Commander about what I found out.”

“The outside world, entering my World of Jin?” Suddenly, there was a surge of murderous intent bursting out from Swan Queen’s eyes. Any life form from the World of Jin would show absolute loyalty to the World of Jin and pure hostility to life forms from the outside world. Swan Queen stared at Cheng Mu Master. “Are you sure you are not lying to me? My World of Jin has not had life forms from the outside world visiting here for a long, long time.”

“I would never dare to lie to Commander. How could I dare to lie about something like that?

Swan Queen stared hard at him. “You must have evidence.”

“I…” Cheng Mu Master started to get flustered. “I saw it with my own eyes, but evidence…? What evidence could I possibly have?”

“Based on nothing but a casual comment from you, I am supposed to investigate that warrior, Milky Way?” Swan Queen retorted coldly.

Despite her words, deep in her heart, Swan Queen had her suspicions. Even if this warrior under her command dared to lie to her, he would not tell such a preposterous tale. Who knew? There might have been truth to what he had said. Regardless, she needed to find some time to investigate and verify.

“I, I…” Cheng Mu Master was very anxious. “Commander, I truly saw it with my own eyes.”

“Humph!” Swan Queen snorted coldly. “I shall spare you of your sin this time around. Take your leave.”

Cheng Mu Master was going crazy as he said through gritted teeth, “I saw him with my own eyes. He is a warrior from the outside world. Commander, you just have to execute your hypnotizing methods and make him fall into an illusion. Then naturally, he will tell you everything willingly. If there is anything untrue to what I saw, or he does not admit that he comes from the outside world even when he has fallen into an illusion, then I am willing to die!”

“Illusion?” Swan Queen was growing impatient as she said, “I don’t think I need you to teach me what to do. You may take your leave!”

“Commander! Everything I say is the truth. Nothing but the naked truth! If you are kind enough to spare him, you will put our World of Jin at a great disadvantage.” Cheng Mu Master was so frantic with anxiety that he started to glare. “Whatever I say, I am willing to die to prove the credibility of my words!”

Hong!

Suddenly, Cheng Mu Master exploded in his entirety. His godly power was annihilated completely, and thereafter, he was reduced to nothingness.

Swan Queen was shocked to have witnessed the entire scene. “Self-destruction? Using his death to prove his loyalty… I simply can’t believe this warrior could be loyal to such a degree.”

Through the years, there were many such warriors who were incomparably upright. She herself had come across quite a few. There were also quite a few who chose death to prove themselves, but this was the very first time she had witnessed a scene of self-destruction unfolding right before her very eyes.

“What a loyal and upright warrior. Such a pity.” Swan Queen shook her head with a sigh. Then her green eyes started to sparkle. “Could it be that there are truly life forms from the outside world in my World of Jin?”

Sou!

Swan Queen vanished into thin air.
