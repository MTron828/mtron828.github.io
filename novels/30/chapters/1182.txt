Chapter 1185: Yin Tuo

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was the eleventh day after Luo Feng had entered God-Destroying Valley, and Luo Feng had become more careful. It was definitely the most dangerous place in Universe Boat, even without that Molten Lava Devil God. He couldn’t afford to be careless in the slightest in God-Destroying Valley.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

Lava sometimes dropped from the sky, which made God-Destroying Valley incredibly hot, and the space was twisted. Occasionally, huge rocks also fell from the sky.

“Huh?” Luo Feng frowned. His golden country detected a great being behind him. “Is… is he Yin Tuo from the first universe incarnation era?”

He immediately matched the aura and look of the great being with the database he had.

Yin Tuo: A great being from the Ancestral God School in the first incarnation era. He is a special life form that looks like a child. He is a special life form who wasn’t born in the universe era Luo Feng lives in. He is extremely powerful.

Also, he followed the path of golden beast god. He was proficient in close combat and spiritual force weapons, too. The spiritual force weapon he used was a pinnacle true treasure known as “Golden Sulphone Armor”! He was a top-tier universe master who could rival Ice Mountain Master and Void Gold Master. He was a special life form with a unique godly body, and it was almost impossible to kill him.

The Ancestral God School represented the origin law of the original universe. After one incarnation, the Ancestral God School from the first universe era escaped, and they couldn’t get back to the original universe. Without the help of the universe origin, the advantages the Ancestral God School had were gone. It became a loose alliance. However, Yin Tuo himself was a handful—worse than An Yong Master.

“It’s him?” Luo Feng frowned. “Even Void Gold Master is easier to deal with than him. It’s impossible to kill him.”

Yin Tuo tried to get the control over space and time, yet he was rejected by the dim golden light. Luo Feng’s control over space and time had already surpassed that of universe masters even before going to the wing space, not to mention now.

“Hahaha! Human!” a squeaky voice said. “How dare you come to God-Destroying Valley. This silver true treasure of yours is indeed special, and that golden domain is indeed powerful. I’ll spare your life if you give me those silver wings. Deal?”

Luo Feng sneered. “In your dreams, Yin Tuo!”

Hong!

Through his golden country, a huge rock dropped from the lava ocean behind him. The rock had a diameter of more than 300 million kilometers. It plummeted at a terrifically high speed. That rock could have killed most universe masters if it had a diameter of more than 100 million kilometers, and with Golden Country, the power of the rock surged. It flew toward Yin Tuo.

Hong! Long! Long!

The rock twisted the space, and it plummeted like a streak of light.

“Humph.”

Yin Tuo yelled, and golden fragments burst out of his body. Billions of golden fragments showed up in the sky and surrounded him as if the fragments were connected. Many law threads connected them immediately, and the golden fragments started to merge with each other.

Ka-cha! Chi! Hua!

A ferocious, single-horned golden lizard 100 thousand kilometers long appeared. It was a golden beast god. The single-horned lizard was forceful just like a beast god, and Yin Tuo was staying in the body of the lizard.

“How impressive the technique is!” Luo Feng couldn’t help exclaiming. It was just like a rebirth of a beast god. He couldn’t do that yet.

Hou!

The golden lizard roared, and it raced toward that rock. It didn’t dodge it; instead, it hit the rock like a freight train.

Peng!

The moment they collided, the golden lizard changed its shape, and its tail slashed the rock. The rock was derailed and kept plummeting. The power from the rock also burst outward when it hit the tail.

Hong!

The golden lizard changed its direction and flew toward Luo Feng.

“It borrowed the energy?” Luo Feng was shocked. “No wonder Yin Tuo is unkillable!”

“Human, you’ve angered me!” the golden lizard said.

“Haha! Then you’ll soon be infuriated,” said Luo Feng.

He looked back. The golden lizard lashed his tail and changed its direction easily. It dodged the lava, and it was fully utilizing the power of golden beast god. Luo Feng was thrilled, as it was like watching the rebirth of a beast god.

A joyful thought went across Luo Feng’s mind. I can’t believe I get to fight a beast god now. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Suddenly, a whirlpool was formed in the lava ocean in the distance.

“Lava whirlpool?”

Luo Feng felt intimidated, as lava whirlpools represented one of the most terrifying threats in God-Destroying Valley—one of the seven most terrifying threats under Molten Lava Devil God. The records in the human race were rare. However, Jie Fanzi had detailed records, including some of the circumstances when individuals had been trapped by lava whirlpools. Apparently, Jie Fanzi had adventured in on such whirlpool before.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

Horrendous wind was formed, and some of the giant rocks on the ground flew out and started to spin in the sky. They spun faster and faster.

“A lava whirlpool right in front of you!” a voice from the golden lizard said. “It’ll get larger and larger as time passes. It’ll definitely expand faster than you can run away. The space around us was already clotted, and there are no space ripples. Haha! You dare come here! I’ve adventured in this place for hundreds of eras, and it’s like my home. You dare fight me here? Haha…”

“Like your home?” said Luo Feng. “Do you think Molten Lava Devil God will show mercy to you?”

Luo Feng rendered that golden lizard speechless for a while.

“You won’t be able to talk later.”

The lava whirlpool kept spinning, and the whirlpool kept getting larger. It reached Luo Feng instantly.

Hong!

The wind was almighty. If someone was trapped in that wind, it would be like being hit by an elementary universe master every 0.01 seconds! Although attacks from an elementary universe master weren’t that strong, the frequency would be able to at least severely injure a universe masters who didn’t have good defending abilities.

Luo Feng was able to resist it, but it sharply slowed him down.

“Hahaha…” laughed the golden lizard. “I’ve been here for hundreds of eras. Human, you’re dead.”

The golden lizard moved in the wind and kept spinning. At the same time, his tail was lashing, making him move easily in the wind.

Hua!

The golden lizard flew to the surface of the rock.

Ka-cha! Ka-cha!

He extended his hoofs and stuck them into the rock. Then he infused his godly power into it… The rock flew toward Luo Feng. It flew in curves and was suppressed by Luo Feng’s Golden Country, but it was still much faster than Luo Feng.

Hong!

The celestial rock got quicker and quicker, and it was impossible to slow it down. It at dashed Luo Feng.

Luo Feng shook his wing and flew toward another rock. He landed on a rock with a diameter of 300 million kilometers.

“You know how to hide!”

The golden lizard controlled the rock. Luo Feng was on a slightly smaller rock.

Hong!

Hong!

It was billions of times stronger than Mars hitting Earth.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

Under that wind, and rocks hit each other, and they all broke down into a multitude of shards. Luo Feng still trembled.

Hua!

A giant golden hoof slashed toward Luo Feng.
