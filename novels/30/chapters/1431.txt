Chapter 1434: So Useless

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“First stage of a newborn… I have regressed by one stage. What should I do?”

Sector Beast Morosa was in agony. It was a highly ambitious Sector Beast, so even within its own nest, it would be the one standing at the peak. The only thing that could instill some fear in it was the most powerful Sector Beast, “Beddy.” Other than Beddy, there was nothing else it feared.

Beddy was also fully aware that only those like Morosa, who had crossed over to the third stage, were a threat to it. It kept a watchful eye over the fights and devouring activities of these third-stage beings!

“Regressing to the first stage, the powerful strength that I originally possessed would immediately disperse. I am forced to fall all the way to the first stage, though it was the pinnacle first stage!”

Sector Beast Morosa was pondering. It might have been severely injured by Luo Feng’s killer moves, but the remaining amount of power still far exceeded the power range of the first stage. If it could not bear with it, it would naturally disperse. Now, it was at the pinnacle first stage. For the Sector Beasts’ nest, this level of power was considered to be power at the bottommost level.

“I still have a chance, still have the final glimmer of chance…” Sector Beast Morosa said to itself. “There is only a handful of Sector Beasts within the nest that have crossed over to the third stage. The majority are in the second stage. As for those in the pinnacle first stage? Maybe there are, maybe there aren’t. And even if there are, they must be hiding somewhere, living their lives quietly as they resigned themselves to their circumstances.”

“My power is very close to the second stage. Besides, I am Morosa, a Sector Beast who stands at the pinnacle… Sensing a hint of my aura from afar, the others would feel scared! They are unaware of the fact that I have become weak.”

Many thoughts were racing through Sector Beast, Morosa’s mind, as he contemplated his action plan. For instance, when two weaker Sector Beasts were fighting one another, it could wait until the later stage of the fight, when one party was about to emerge as victor. Then it would exude its aura from afar, scare the winning party away, and kill the losing party instead. Even the losing party in its state of severe injuries would most likely be more powerful than Morosa.

“I must give it a try and fight on. I am now at pinnacle first stage. I just need to eat one Sector Beast from the second stage. I will be able to move up to the second stage right away. Even if vying to be the ultimate king was impossible, there was still the possibility of threatening Universe Ocean.”

Sector Beast Morosa quickly pondered over the situation to come up with its plan. “If I fail, I will divulge the secret of devouring the origins of miniature universes to speedily increase one’s powers!”

“Milky Way Horde Leader… I will be back!” Sector Beast, Morosa’s two heads looked toward the primal universe before it instantly teleported and disappeared.

After the battle with Sector Beast Morosa, Luo Feng also boarded Star Tower and headed back to the primal universe. After all, he had gotten what he was after through this battle: the blood of a Sector Beast. Naturally, it would have to be brought back to the primal universe for his Remote Ocean to analyze and study. Perhaps this time, he would be able to surpass the last step and achieve a breakthrough where the life gene level of his godly body would exceed 90,000 times.

“Aye!” Standing inside Star Tower, Luo Feng, garbed in a suit of white robe, sighed gently.

Beside him were Hong and Fire Dome. The two had witnessed the entire battle. After the battle ended, Luo Feng also let them in on some detailed information, so they were clear about the entire process.

“We are in trouble.” Luo Feng shook his head. “This battle was fought by my team on Star Tower… I’m afraid many true gods of Universe Ocean have already caught wind of the news. The various races of Universe Ocean are already devoid of endurance against attacks. But this time, I have failed to kill Sector Beast. I think this might cause the various races of Universe Ocean to collapse.”

Hong said, “Luo Feng, do not overtax yourself. You have already done enough. Besides, didn’t you say so yourself? That Sector Beast has been banished back to the first stage from its original third stage. Its power is now very, very weak. The chances of it restoring itself to full power is almost impossible. Any true god who is just a tad more powerful would be able to annihilate it.”

Luo Feng shook his head. “Saying that it would be unable to restore its power, that was purely my personal conjecture. I have deduced that it will need to devour other Sector Beasts in order to advance to the second stage and eventually into the third stage. However, these are purely deductions! Although it is very easy to kill right now, it is highly unlikely for that Sector Beast to show itself when it is vulnerable. It will remain in hiding as it gradually regains its power while also thinking of ways to increase its power. When it shows up again, it will certainly be even more difficult to handle than before!”

Hong and Fire Dome both gave slight nods. Fair enough. Any living being with some degree of wisdom would think likewise. When weak and small, it was a natural reaction to go into hiding.

“Teacher, no matter what, at least for a short period of time, that Sector Beast will not reappear,” Fire Dome said.

Luo Feng nodded slightly and said with a sigh, “All right, I have to go and send out this piece of news. I truly don’t know… How would the various true gods of the Universe Ocean react the moment they caught wind of this news?”

******

Within an individual plane surface that solely belonged to Luo Feng, on the public square before a palace that was suspended in the air of the primal universe, more than 50 true gods had gathered together from the Ancestral God School, the human race, the various races of the Hong Alliance, and the Space Beast Alliance. The true gods were all discussing things via voice transmissions, as no one dared to make a single utterance out loud for fear of distracting Luo Feng, who was sitting before them cross-legged.

“This time, during the battle with the Sector Beast, the team on Star Tower was much stronger than the team on the vessel. It will definitely be able to annihilate that Sector Beast. Hmm. That Sector Beast deserves nothing more than death.”

The true gods were all waiting with apprehension. They all felt as though they were facing a life-and-death situation. More on point, it was a situation that made them even more nervous than a life-and-death situation! The Sector Beast was a threat to everything they had sought to protect. If there was no longer anyone who was able to stop this Sector Beast, then regardless of whether one wanted to transcend a reincarnation era—or protect one’s race or close friends—all would be futile efforts, as everything would be annihilated.

“Milky Way Horde Leader is getting up.”

“Milky Way!”

Suddenly, there was a commotion. From where he was seated in a cross-legged manner, Luo Feng stood up. His gaze swept through the numerous true gods present. Then slowly, he said, “Everyone, after this battle, that Sector Beast will not show up again so soon. At least not in this recent period of time.”

Everyone was taken by surprise.

“Milky Way Horde Leader, what you just said… What do you mean?”

“Once that Sector Beast is dead, does it mean that after a period of time, the other Sector Beasts will also come out of their nest? No matter what, so long as we can kill one, we are sure to be able to kill more!”

The numerous true gods were all engaged in discussion. They were all filled with anticipation. If they had managed to kill one Sector Beast, then it would be a great boost to their confidence.

Luo Feng pointed far into midair and drew with his consciousness. Immediately, the battle scene appeared. “All of you, take a careful look, and you will understand everything.”

Scenes of the battle between Luo Feng and Sector Beast replayed before everyone. As for the method of Whirlpool World, it was clearly made public to the audience. To Luo Feng, who was already the number one being in Universe Ocean, even if he wanted to go public about something, no one could do much to stop him.

As for the conversation between Luo Feng and Sector Beast, there was no need nor elaboration. Luo Feng merely provided a brief explanation to update the crowd.

“It had deteriorated from the third stage to the first stage,” said Luo Feng. “It is so weak that not a single true god would fear it. Any true god that is slightly more powerful will be able to annihilate it. So, that Sector Beast will not show up again so soon—at least not for this recent period of time.”

Silence prevailed.

The numerous true gods witnessed the entire battle. Everyone had complex feelings. While they marveled about how powerful Luo Feng was, they were at the same time feeling greatly shocked. That Sector Beast’s means of escape were indeed formidable. Even when trapped in a sealed space, it could actually execute an ultimate survival technique that resembled a portal to make a speedy escape in an instant. Although Sector Beast Morosa seemed to have paid a hefty price to execute this technique, it had, at the very least, managed to stay alive.

If he did not kill his enemy, then once the enemy regained all its power, it would stage a comeback!

“Everything is as expected.”

Luo Feng said no more as he turned and directly walked into the palace. All that needed to be said had been said. What had to be disclosed had been disclosed.

If the true gods of Universe Ocean were so desperate that some had decided to pledge allegiance to the Sector Beasts. That would also be the choice they made.

Amidst the clouds high up in the skies of Earth, a lone figure was seated.

“How unexpected. He did not succeed?” Sitting Mountain Guest was sitting on the clouds as he frowned. “The Sector Beast is unexpectedly quite a tough nut to crack! This Sector Beast disaster is scarier than I had expected. Now, the Sector Beasts are still growing up and are not in their final moments. In the future, though… I’m uncertain of whether this disciple of mine will be able to stop them. I have put in such immeasurable efforts…”

Sitting Mountain Guest revealed a trace of anxiety in his eyes.

Purple Moon Holy Land Universe.

Purple Moon Ancestor sat on his throne with his eyes shut as he sank into deep thoughts. He was waiting for news, waiting for news about the battle between Luo Feng and the Sector Beast.

“Luo Feng, although I really would have rejoiced over your death, it is a fact that we need to rely on you to deal with that Sector Beast! Even if you bear deep hatred for us, you also have to deal with it; for your humans, for your homeland in the pulse of the Earth, you have to deal with it… You have to win, you must win!”

Purple Moon Ancestor was chanting in his mind. I have cultivated for endless time and transcended reincarnations. Now, I have been met with a greater opportunity… I can become even more powerful, but my miniature universe must never, ever be devoured. The moment that happens, I am truly finished. Also, there is my clan to think of… This is my only worry.

Purple Moon Ancestor shut his eyes. He could “see” very clearly every single space within the entire Purple Moon Holy Land Universe; he saw the birth of numerous children and saw them growing up; he saw how they either matured whilst honing their skills in blood and fire or faltered and fell… This was his clan. The clan that gave birth to him.

A long, long time ago, he was also just an ordinary member of the clan. But later on, he continued to rise and rise until he became the strongest master of the entire clan. He established his holy land universe and was thereafter regarded as a tried-and-true ancestor of his clan.

“All of them. They are all a part of my clan. The endless years of hard work and effort I’ve spent. The paths of hard work I’ve trod… Everything and anything. The moment the Sector Beast devours my miniature universe and causes my miniature universe to collapse, then everything will ultimately come to an end. Luo Feng… If I can’t kill you, you will become my greatest threat. But this time, you have to kill the Sector Beast. You must!”

Purple Moon Ancestor was fervently looking forward to the death of the Sector Beast.

Suddenly, the numerous great beings beneath Purple Moon Ancestor transmitted an announcement without delay: “Ancestor, we have news.”

Purple Moon Ancestor opened his eyes suddenly and looked toward the crowd beneath. “Has Luo Feng killed the Sector Beast?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“No,” someone from the crowd below replied. “The Sector Beast is not dead. It escaped.”

Purple Moon Ancestor’s expression changed drastically.

What…? This was only a single Sector Beast that had come out of the Sector Beasts’ nest, and yet Luo Feng was unable to kill it?

“Based on the information given, Luo Feng has gained the absolute upper-hand and has caused the Sector Beast to suffer a great loss of power. Yet, toward the end, that Sector Beast decided to pay a humongous price to execute just one move. It was a move that seemed to involve something that resembled a portal, through which it instantly transported itself away!”

The underlings were filled with reverence as they said, “At this moment, the power of this Sector Beast could be so harmless that none of the true gods would be afraid of it at all.”

“Nonsense!” Purple Moon Ancestor’s face was ghastly pale. “Sector Beast is weak and small. Would it let you find it? That Sector Beast will definitely hide while it restores its power!”

“Sector Beast, Sector Beast. Just one Sector Beast is already such trouble.”

“We don’t even know how many more are in the Sector Beasts’ nest!”

“This Luo Feng is just so useless!” Purple Moon Ancestor said through gritted teeth. His heart was filled with agony and fear.
