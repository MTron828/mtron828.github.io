Chapter 1407: Hatred Deep within the Soul

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Get lost!” Purple Moon Ancestor’s face seemed to be clouded by a layer of frost as he bellowed furiously at the crowd beneath him.

The group of universe masters beneath him were all on their knees, shuddering in fear and overwhelmed by uneasiness. Purple Moon Alliance’s loss this time around was massive. As many as half the entire force of universe masters had entered the World of Jin, and all had perished. The number of universe masters left within the Purple Moon Holy Land still alive was down to less than 100. Even if the universe-masters-to-be all achieved breakthroughs successively, the number of universe masters would barely break 100. But, speaking of universe-masters-to-be, there truly was not a single one.

“Ancestor, we… Are we still going to the World of Jin?” Of all the numerous universe masters who were still on their knees beneath him, none had left, but there were still some who had to ask him this question, as they were filled with great dissatisfaction.

Purple Moon Ancestor looked down at them. His expression was increasingly awful, and he was silent for a long while before saying, “The newly promoted universe masters will go to the World of Jin! And you all shall not reveal your identities as members of the Purple Moon Holy Land!”

The newly promoted universe masters, feeling somewhat delighted at the decision, responded, “Understood.”

They had never set foot out of Purple Moon Holy Land, but this time, because a great number of universe masters had lost their lives, they, as universe-masters-to-be, had been able to achieve breakthroughs. So long as they could change their appearances and not take up symbolic forms—like “three heads and eight arms” or “double faces with four arms”—the other groups of powers within Universe Ocean would definitely not be able to guess their true identities.

Once they had infiltrated the World of Jin, if great beings from the other powerful groups within Universe Ocean saw them, they would probably think of them as natives of the World of Jin.

“Take your leave.” Purple Moon Ancestor’s voice was getting more and more hostile.

Hua!

A group of universe masters finally disappeared and left. Only Purple Moon Ancestor was left in the hall. As arrogant as he was, he had been forced to tell them not to reveal their identities as members of the Purple Moon Holy Land. He must have felt extremely ashamed and insulted.

“Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng!” Purple Moon Ancestor gritted his teeth.

He was furious. He was unwilling. But so what? This was an act of destructive revenge, and he was aware that, other than the humans, he simply could not think of any other top power that would do such a thing!

“I may not be able to do anything to you, but with the birth of the Sector Beast this time around, I don’t think you will not be able to make it out alive.” Purple Moon Ancestor gritted his teeth. Every time the thought of a Sector Beast came to mind, he grew more agitated because a Sector Beast was a major threat to him.

Purple Moon Ancestor tilted his head back and roared.

“Ah! Ah! Ah…!”

How long had it been? Just how long had it been since he had felt so helpless?

Yet no matter how angry Purple Moon Ancestor was, there was nothing he could do. There was no way he could kill Luo Feng. Even if he wanted to make use of the World of Jin to kill him, the moment he failed, all the universe masters under him command that had been brought into the World of Jin would perish. Without all those universe masters, he was unable to do anything to Luo Feng.

******

If Purple Moon Ancestor was merely furious and unwilling, then the various races from the united forces alliance from the primal universe were filled with endless enmity and hatred!

“Sister!”

“Sister!”

An extraordinarily beautiful young girl, with butterfly wings that were partially transparent, stood amidst the void space. She wore a pained expression as though she was suffering, and the eyes beneath her delicate brows seemed to contain great agony and sadness. Various scenes were replaying in her mind as she recalled growing up with her sister. Her sister had been guiding and protecting her all this while. Her sister was an extraordinary talent and had become a noble universe master of the bug clan. Under her sister’s help and guidance, after many long years, she had finally become a universe knight.

Those years had given rise to a relationship between the sisters that transcended all else—including her life. Her sister was the most important person in her life.

The extraordinarily beautiful young girl raised her head and let out a piercing scream. “No!”

Then her face became contorted. Fiery hatred blazed in her eyes as she said in a hoarse voice laden with endless hatred, “Humans! Humans, I want you all dead! Dead! Dead!”

A faint blue light suddenly appeared around the space surrounding the beautiful girl, enveloping her. In an instant, she was being transported away.

Three minutes later, in the human territory, the towering bug clan mother nest hung suspended in space. Around it, many bugs soldiers appeared.

A wave of anger was transmitted from the mother nest.

“Go out there and kill. Kill all the humans.”

Various bizarre noises were heard as numerous bug soldiers roared and yelled while speeding across the vast void space.

“Oh!”

“Roar!”

They were charging toward the faraway life planet while the mother nest had already vanished with a single teleportation. It teleported like a flash of lightning to reach as far as 10,000 light years away.

“Go and kill, kill all the humans!”

The bug clan mother nest was still giving out the order. Great batches of bugs soldiers continued to roar as they charged out.

This bug clan mother nest was teleporting like crazy. With every 10,000 light years span it teleported across, it released a large batch of bug soldiers. They were largely from the universe level. A small number were from the domain level, and a few were sector lords! There was not a single undying being.

“Kill all the humans! My children, go out there and kill!”

The mother nest moved erratically while releasing countless bugs warriors. To a mother queen who was a universe knight herself, creating billions of universe level bug soldiers was nothing difficult. All of them were at the universe level and more than enough to massacre countless planets.

******

At the sixth minute after the bug clan’s mother queen had started the rampage in the human territory, the hideous mother nest came to a halt and remained unmoving in the middle of space. Everything quietened down, and around it, the numerous bug soldiers suspended in the air also stopped.

Hua!

A lone figure walked over from afar.

A piercing, hysterical voice was heard from the bug clan mother nest. “Milky Way Horde Leader!”

Luo Feng walked over leisurely, shaking his head. He whispered with a sigh, “Why go to such lengths?”

He pointed into the distance.

Peng!

Far away, a part of void space suddenly shrank, then expanded. Right away, that part of space was annihilated. The lofty mother nest and the countless bug warriors previously occupying that part of space were all reduced to nothingness.

Luo Feng shook his head and sighed. The bug soldiers’ universe knight mother queen had entered a region that was within Ganwu Universe. Once Luo Feng had received information transmitted over from the virtual universe, he had immediately made use of God Country Transportation and a couple of teleportations to rush over. As that bug clan mother nest was constantly teleporting and changing direction, Luo Feng only managed to catch up with it at the sixth minute after the start of the rampage upon entering the human territory.

“Just one revenge. A universe knight annihilated. Is this what we call hatred?” Luo Feng sighed gently. Then, with a single stride, he vanished into the shadows of the starry sky.

All was silent, and everything was shrouded in darkness. It was as though nothing had happened.

******

Milky Way Holy Land.

Luo Feng returned to a cluster of undulating palaces.

“Horde Leader.” The three universe knights at the forefront bowed and greeted with unparalleled reverence. Out of the three, a tall and sturdy universe knight with green tentacles said, “We have teleported repeatedly and killed all the bugs warriors we found in various places who were in the midst of their rampage. Many of these bug soldiers did not even make it in time to descend on the planet before we killed them. It’s just that… there were still 369 life planets where all the humans were killed. Of these 369, there were 102 where the very planets themselves were completely shattered.”

Luo Feng nodded.

In his heart, he could not help sighing. The total population of humans on over 300 life planets most likely numbered in the billions. Yet, in a moment as fleeting as the blink of the eye, all of them were dead. From the perspective of the entire human race, ordinary humans were able to multiply in numbers generation after generation. Overall, even if many were killed, this was nothing much at all. But they were, after all, still life forms that were full of vitality. Among them, there might have been potential talents that could have risen to be the cream of the crop—perhaps even people like Rong Jun, or even an existence like Luo Feng could have been born, although that was highly unlikely. But now, all of these people were merely lifeless corpses.

“Revenge for much too many,” Luo Feng said to himself. “Those who bear hatred for my human race… There are simply too many of them.”

In recent months, the various groups of top powers within the united forces alliance had lost a great many universe masters. Some of them had been from the pinnacle races, but most were from the common pool of races at large. The more powerful races would normally have, at most, one or two universe masters, and these universe masters would be the leaders of their races. To the universe knights of those races, these universe masters were like their parents and mentors!

Some could no longer contain the hatred in their hearts; right away, they had charged forth to take their revenge for the loss of their mentors. There were also others who had decided to put up with the burning hatred. They bore it as best they could, for the sake of their race.

******

“Fighting the humans? How can we fight them? Our Northern Territory Alliance is already so weak, and our Alliance Master has long abandoned us. Now, the various races within our alliance are so weak. After adding up all the universe masters… we are still not a match for that one single Milky Way Horde Leader. You still want to fight?”

On an ordinary, desolate planet, various godly-powered avatars had gathered for a discussion. They did not dare to come in their original bodies, as they were afraid that they would be killed by the humans all at once.

“This great hatred—how can be we not take revenge?”

“The hatred is certainly great. Two of my brothers were killed. They had been my company for an eternity, and together, we led our race in establishing our footing in this vast universe. Now, they are both dead! They were my most important family member. My most valued companions. And how I wish I could charge in to where the humans are and massacre them all…! But what would be the outcome? If we were to enter important grounds like the primal secret region or Milky Way Holy Land, then not only will there be nothing we can kill, but we will only go there to die! If all I can do is kill ordinary humans, after a couple of decades, another generation will emerge once again. They will not be affected at all. If we go now… it will only serve the purpose of venting our moment of hatred. We need to live, and we must live for our race!”

“But—but I am not willing to! I am overflowing with resentment!”

“You are resentful—just like the Qu Nong race, who had all their universe masters wiped out. They are all rushing to escape for dear lives now. They needed to ensure that their race could survive, but their resentment was far greater! What could they have possibly done? Back when we were still strong, the humans were already exerting their influence over us. What about now? The various minor races were already so afraid that they had left the united forces alliance. How many universe masters left behind would dare to persevere in their desire to fight the humans? For those supreme masters who were lone travelers, the moment they saw how the situation could be played to their disadvantage, one after the other, they left our united forces alliance. As for the few universe masters who were resolute enough to stay behind… the moment the humans sent over an army large enough, the impact of that willpower was strong enough to cast down a great number of them. How many could stand strong in a fight against the humans?”

The godly-powered avatars of the surviving universe masters of the Northern Territory Alliance all fell silent.

How miserable and dreary their situation had become! Various minor races had left the united forces alliance because they simply could not go through another devastating loss. Universe masters who were lone travelers had also left because, to them, the future was bleak and hopeless.

Who remained? The bug clan, the demons, and the automaton race. Yet who would dare to fight the humans again? Who would dare?

“Even if our hatred was larger than life, what more could we do?”

“I don’t know how many other races bear hatred for the humans, but it is fated… that within the entire primal universe, the humans will be the race that truly dominates. No one will be able to stand in their path. No one at all!”
