Chapter 1263: The Final Distribution of True Treasures

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Within Universe Ocean, in the deep region of the endless chaotic airflow, a Boat of Mausoleum was at rest; in the other direction, a crimson pagoda appeared out of nowhere, where it immediately transformed in a crimson streak of light. It flew toward that Boat of Mausoleum, and, while merely inches away from the Boat of Mausoleum, it vanished into thin air.

“Golden horned beast body.”

In the hall, with a stone blade on his back, Luo Feng watched the golden horned beast appear before him. They looked one another in the eye. Both pairs of eyes reflected the same steely determination.

“War!” Luo Feng whispered.

When Huge Axe Creator was annihilated, Luo Feng was aware that this period would be the most critical time for the humans; universe masters scattered all over Universe Ocean and the Original Stars were rushing back, so his golden horned beast body, which was initially deployed to the deeper region of the Universe Boat to obtain the legacy of Jie Fanzi, was naturally summoned back immediately.

After all, his golden horned beast body was holding onto Shi Wu Wings and Star Tower, which made up a total of two supreme true treasures! This was superior combat power altogether. During a war that would decide the fate of a race, such power was a necessity.

If there is war, my original earthling body and my golden horned beast body can set off for war together, Luo Feng thought.

His original earthling body had the formidable Blood Ghost Blade suitable for attacking even the toughest opponents! Even if pitted against a universe supreme master, he would still dare to take up a one-on-one fight.

Golden horned beast body had Shi Wu Wings. The godly blood stains on Shi Wu Wings could bring about extremely effective impact on willpower, especially when dealing with ordinary universe masters. It could simply wipe them out! And with the protection of ‘Star Tower’… it could easily deal with an enemy force as big as hundreds and thousands of soldiers. Each had different combat personalities.

Come on, Luo Feng silently said to himself.

He had already prepared himself. Perhaps in Universe Ocean, he would be at a disadvantage when confronting universe supreme masters because his godly power was holding him back, but in the original universe, there was an ultimate limit of power. The sixth tier was the ultimate limit, and every universe supreme master would be allowed to unleash their combat power to as much as this limit allowed before the original universe would start to exert suppression.

It was a powerful suppression, so powerful that relying on Blood Ghost Blade, Luo Feng dared to fight the war. It was just a pity that he could only fight the war without being able to hold his opponent back. The initiative still lay with the opponent.

After meeting up with Golden Horned Beast, Luo Feng boarded the Boat of Mausoleum and speedily returned to the original universe. The trip to and from took him a total of 18 days.

Primal universe, Primal Chaos City, within Primal Chaos City Leader’s Palace.

“Teacher.” Luo Feng met with the other body of Primal Chaos City Leader that sported a more hideous appearance.

“You’re back.” Primal Chaos City Leader nodded.

“The other races are keeping quiet, not making any moves recently. They have yet to learn of the news of Huge Axe Creator’s annihilation, I suppose?” Luo Feng asked persistently.

“Not a single movement yet.” Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “Maybe it hasn’t been long enough, and internally, our race is keeping the secret well under wraps. When seen by any of those beneath us, the large-scale movement of undying spirits will appear as a lack of order—a messy commotion! As for those in Universe Ocean who may or may not have seen Huge Axe’s miniature universe collapsing, we will just have to depend on our luck.”

“Yes.” Luo Feng nodded.

If they were lucky, no one would pass by the place where Huge Axe’s miniature universe was for the next ten to 100 years.

If they were unlucky, then perhaps that very day, some universe master would penetrate the walls of the original universe and make the discovery.

“It will be best if no one discovers it. The longer, the better.” Primal Chaos City Leader gave a rare smile. “If we can give rise to another universe supreme master, that is ideal. You have brought the two supreme true treasures safely back, which is a contribution beyond words.”

Luo Feng nodded and could not help but ask, “Teacher, the distribution of the two supreme true treasures…?”

“Let’s go, we will talk when we get inside the virtual universe,” Primal Chaos City Leader said.

“Oh.” Luo Feng was left with no choice.

Previously, he had talked Teacher into it. But it seemed like Teacher had already made up his mind that the two supreme true treasures would be distributed to Darkness Master and Peng Gong Master. Luo Feng was in disagreement because these treasures were his contributions; of course, it made sense that they would be distributed according to his wishes, which was why teacher and disciple had both came to an agreement that the final decision would be made only after a thorough discussion with Peng Gong Master and Darkness Master.

******

In the virtual universe, at the long stone table before Huge Axe’s godly palace, four figures were now seated. They were Primal Chaos City Leader, Darkness Master, Peng Gong Master, and Luo Feng! The four of them were now the strongest beings of the entire human race, and they formed the four pillars supporting the race.

“Two supreme true treasures are brought back.” Primal Chaos City Leader smiled. “They are Black Prison Tower and Yan Jun Rod! The special traits of Black Tower Prison… Brother, Peng Gong, both of you should know. I feel that it is very suitable for you, my brother.”

“Me?” Darkness Master was momentarily shocked. No matter how detached and aloof he could be, he could not help but feel his heart trembling because this was a supreme true treasure they were talking about. “Brother…” Darkness Master started to speak.

“Don’t refute this,” Primal Chaos City Leader said with a nod. “Your power is comparable to mine, even though in war you may be a bit less powerful. The help that Black Prison Tower can supplement me with mainly lies in providing me with stronger defensive ability. But for you, you can put it to highly good use in terms of attacking. In your hands, it will be able to unleash stronger powers. And Peng Gong, that Yan Jun Rod—out of us all, only you are skillful with the use of rod-type weapons to launch attacks. There is no need for you to decline any further.”

Peng Gong Master hesitated a little.

True. Out of all the strongest beings of the human race, only he was skilled in using rod type techniques, and now that the human race was facing a critical moment, he should not try to object so strongly. Yet if that was the case, would it not mean that he and Darkness would each be taking one supreme true treasure? What about Primal Chaos City Leader? For countless years, Primal Chaos City Leader had been known to be only second to Huge Axe. He was the most hopeful candidate for the next universe supreme master.

“Primal Chaos City Leader, you…” Peng Gong started to say.

“Teacher…” Luo Feng said.

He was also hesitating, unsure of how he should go about persuading. If his persuasion worked, then the previous meeting with Primal Chaos City Leader alone would have been more than enough to get him to agree with him.

“This is not just my decision. It is also Teacher Origin’s decision.” Primal Chaos City Leader finally opened up.

“Teacher Origin’s decision?” Luo Feng, Peng Gong, and Darkness were all shocked.

Suddenly, on an empty stone chair by that long stone table, a white-robed man appeared. Luo Feng and the rest quickly turned around and with great reverence, shouted, “Teacher Origin!”

Looking at the white-robed man, the tension and pressure that had been weighing Luo Feng down of late finally loosened up a little.

The human race… still had Teacher Origin!

Even when Teacher Origin was under eternal suppression, he was still able to provide humans with the original universe as their land of retreat.

“The few of you here are all quite powerful.” Teacher Origin looked towards Luo Feng and the other three. “If you all are given some time, together with the systematic guidance Luo Feng obtained from the ancient civilization, all four of you can be hopeful in becoming universe supreme masters… What a pity that time is a luxury that the humans seriously lack at the moment. But if you all are pitted against any one group in a fight, given your powers and the supreme true treasures, you all should have nothing to fear!”

“And yet, only Luo Feng has gotten the inheritance from the pulse of Duan Dong River, which is the same as saying the humans have gotten the inheritance! This time around, Huge Axe’s annihilation…” Teacher Origin’s eyes flashed a hint of grief. “Considering the numerous universe supreme masters within the original universe, I’m afraid not many could remain unmoved. My human race will come to face all sorts of attacks, be it openly or in the dark, from the various groups of powers in the entire original universe.

“There is nothing else to fear. Given your powers, even if you are pitted against a universe supreme master, under the limit set by the original universe on universe supreme masters, you have nothing to fear. My only worry is that you all will be sealed!”

“Sealed…”

Everyone’s expression changed, Luo Feng along with the rest. Yes, even if they had other true treasures—or even supreme true treasures with them—there was a possibility of being sealed all the same! Once they were sealed, if they were brought to a certain miniature universe, they would certainly be at the mercy of their captor.

And the strongest defense capable of resisting this seal: Star Tower and Black Prison Tower!

When a supreme true treasure palace was pitted against a seal, the outcome would depend on which was stronger.

“When two to three universe supreme masters join forces, first, they will surround you all so that no one can escape. Second, they will suppress you all with a seal right away.” Teacher Origin shook his head with a sigh. “Once you are being sealed, all will be too late, so you all must bear this in mind… Sealing you is very easy, but if you all are thinking of sealing a universe supreme master, that is difficult.”

Luo Feng and the rest nodded. His words were so true. Even if the space ripples were locked down and teleportation was impossible, the speed of a universe supreme master was still able to soar by leaps and bounds to reach a speed that was way beyond the limit of the universe laws! They were in total control when it came to initiating a war or not. If they wanted to leave, they could depart anytime; if they wanted to rage war, they could fight anytime.

“However, our human race does have some capital, too,” Teacher Origin said solemnly. “We have Black Tower Prison. And Luo Feng also has a Boat of Mausoleum, so we got to put them to good use… In this war, it will be better to lay low at the beginning, but the moment we start attacking, we must do so viciously! Make the other races feel the pain, fear, and hesitation. Then we shall have achieved something. At least there will be some effect on those other races who do not have much power but are just here to reap some benefits from us; this will send running.”

Primal Chaos City Leader, Darkness Master, Peng Gong Master, and Luo Feng all nodded. The nine top powers in the original universe weren’t the only groups that had to be considered! There were still various other groups like the Thorn Ring Alliance and many more. Many other groups of powers that were one notch lower in abilities might also find the human race an easy target for bullying and thus, join in the siege. That would be a terrifying notion.

“For the distribution of true treasures this time around,” Teacher Origin said, “Darkness will take Black Prison Tower, and Peng Gong will take Yan Jun Rod! As for Primal Chaos City Leader… you will take charge of the primal secret region. You shall not attack recklessly. If Primal Chaos City Leader has to attack, that will indicate that the human race is facing its final stage of desperation.”

Luo Feng, Darkness Master, and Peng Gong Master hesitated slightly.

Finally, all of them nodded. They all knew what Teacher Origin meant. Obviously, when there was the need to go out onto the battlefield, the race had to depend on the three of them, while Primal Chaos City Leader would be the last line of defense in the primal secret region!

Time passed.

The human race had always remained cautious and maintained vigilance, so it seemed like the various races in the original universe and the other groups of top powers within the Universe Ocean were still oblivious to Huge Axe Creator’s annihilation. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Universe Ocean, within East Emperor Holy Land Universe.

In a remote location within the vast East Emperor Holy Land universe, Luo Feng had chosen a dilapidated universe that was nearer to the original universe to carry out their deal, but that place was much too far from East Emperor Holy Land. Even if North True Star Master were to teleport over long distances, he only managed to return to East Emperor Holy Land half a month after Luo Feng arrived back at the original universe.

Within North True Star Master’s palace…

Hua!

North True Star Master stood within his palace where a lone figure was suspended in midair. It was East Emperor Ancestor, who had appeared out of thin air a while ago and was radiating cyan light.

“Ancestor.” North True Star Master bowed respectfully. “I have gotten hold of the memory stone.”

“Give it to me.” East Emperor Ancestor looked down at North True Star Master with a glimmer of desire in his eyes.

“Yes.”

With a flip of his hand, a black stone appeared in North True Star Master’s palm: memory stone. With a wave of his hand, the memory stone appeared before East Emperor Ancestor, who then looked down at it in his palm. The look in his eyes changed… He had desired it so much…

Shortly after, a stream of light ray shone from East Emperor Ancestor’s palm and enveloped the memory stone. Instantly, a large amount of information from the memory stone surged directly into East Emperor Ancestor’s mind.
