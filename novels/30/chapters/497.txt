Luo Feng didn’t wear his black armor today. Instead, he was dressed in a long black robe and stood empty handed by the wall.

“Pure feather family?” Luo Feng smiled. Hu! His entire being vanished into the wind, without a trace or sound, entering deep into the luxurious mansion.

……

Pure Feather mansion took up 10km in area. It was split into the outer mansion and inner mansion. The outer mansion were for lower or more ordinary members of the family, hence the security around there was more lax. However, it was obvious that the security around the inner mansion was tighter.

Shua!

Shua!

A black robed man took 3 simple steps, within the dark vegetation, walls, walkways 3 images appeared, and he had already reached near the inner mansion.

“The blood river crystal mission is one of the dangerous missions. It won’t be that easy to acquire it.” Luo Feng half squatted below a huge rock. His gaze swept the area and his spirit energy connected with the universe space, feeling the surrounding life energies. “The energies within the inner mansion is obviously much stronger. Just the universe levels alone, there are quite a few!”

To wander in casually was impossible.

Sou! Luo Feng was incomparably serious. As he unleashed his illusionary movement, his entire being became a silhouette in the dark night, almost like a tiger with wings, and he swiftly entered the inner mansion.

“Be serious, don’t look like you are falling asleep.”

“Captain, who would dare invade the Pure feather family mansion? There’s no need to be that serious.”

“Not being serious is fine, however you still have to at least put up an act. Otherwise it’ll be bad if you are discovered. I am saying this for your own good.”

A guard team was patrolling the inner mansion, the guards were walking and communicating.

Hu!

From behind them, a blurry silhouette swiftly flashed past them, reaching deeper into the inner mansion. When Luo Feng used the Illusionary movement, he was even harder to detect. Plus, he was following the flow of the universe space and dodged all the dark sentries. However, this had shocked Luo Feng, as the security was extremely tight. The 2nd most powerful family next to the city leader’s family, was definitely no joke.

“Ahead is that useless advisor’s living quarters.” Luo Feng stuck to the stone pillar in the walkway. Almost like a shadow, his eyes were gazing coldly at the distant quiet quarters.

Shua!

Luo Feng resonated with the ripples of the universe space, forming 3 peculiar arcs and entered the quiet pavilion.

Pavilion 2nd level.

Dressed in a white robe, a pale skinny man sat at his study desk, thinking about something.

There was definitely a large group of tacticians in these large families, as such business families favored these tacticians more. As for this white robed man, he was the Pure feather family’s highest ranking tactician, the most favored Yu Ke Qi. He held an extremely high position in the family.

Just from his quarters being in the inner mansion and having such a big and quiet pavilion, one could see his status.

“Yu Ke Qi.” A voice resounded.

“Hm?” The white robed man trembled. He turned to look behind him, where stood a black robed black haired man.

“Master!”

The white robed man bowed respectfully, his eyes filled with a burning loyalty.

“Hm.” Luo Feng nodded. These past 6 days, in order to get every detail on the Pure feather family, he planned carefully and studied from many angles, and did not just rely on the general information he got from the city’s systems. He had also used soul control techniques on a few important people within the family to do a proper check.

As for these soul techniques, his teacher, the master of the Yun Mo Planet Hu Yan Bo who specialized in the soul aspect, had great accomplishments in them. He could even do slave imprints, naturally there were many other lesser techniques. And the Time Space scribbles 1st book too had many soul techniques.

Against this white robed man, he had only used a technique akin to hypnosis.

“I want to see your family leader now, are you ready?” Luo Feng asked.

“Please relax master, I am the trusted aide of the family leader, he has complete trust in me. Even if I wanted to see him late at night, it won’t be a problem.” The white robed Yu Ke Qi was extremely confident.

“You lead the way.” Luo Feng said.

“Yes.”

The white robed Yu Ke Qi said respectfully, “Master only has to follow behind me.” Following which, he immediately went downstairs with Luo Feng following him.

“Creak!” After opening the door, Yu Ke Qi brought Luo Feng about publicly.

Walking along the walkways, they were extremely silent.

“Hm?” Luo Feng could see a guard team in the distance walking over. The leader of the team looked at the white robed man and smiled, “Mr Yu.”

“Hm.” Yu Ke Qi nodded indifferently.

The guard team didn’t even question who was the black robed man and left. Yu Ke Qi communicated mentally, “Master please relax, because of the occasional important matters, I would have talks with the family leader late at night. I would also occasionally bring people to meet him. Even though I am usually instructed to bring these people, the guards don’t know anything. Hence, there’s absolutely no problem in me bringing someone along.”

“Hm.” Luo Feng nodded.

They continued.

1 level after another.

Luo Feng simply walked about openly from sentry to sentry. They didn’t even have any reaction. No matter what, the two of them continued deeper into the mansion.

“The deeper we go, the tighter the security is. Even if I wish to enter here without anyone noticing me, it would be impossible.” Luo Feng looked ahead at the vast surroundings. With just a glance, he was able to determine that there were at least 1,000 people patrolling. Obviously, they had already reached the family’s core.

“Open the door!” Yu Ke Qi shouted.

“Yes Mr Yu, please wait a moment.” Immediately the guards opened the door.

Under the surveillance of 1,000 guards, Yu Ke Qi brought Luo Feng into the core of the mansion.

“Master, this is already the core area of the family. The family leader, the important disciples and a few absolute powers, treasure troves, dojo etc are all here.” Yu Ke Qi communicated. “The family leader’s living quarters isn’t far from here. Hm, at last, we’ve arrived to the front of the palace.”

Luo Feng carefully examined it.

Ahead was a 500m long and wide ancient wall, and within it was a 9 storey high palace. Outside the palace, stood two guards.

“Open the door.” Yu Ke Qi said.

“Who is he?” Of the two guards, the one on the left frowned and pointed at Luo Feng.

“He’s someone the leader wants to meet.” Yu Ke Qi frowned. “Hurry and open the door.”

“The leader didn’t inform us of meeting anyone late at night today.” The left guard continued to carefully analyze Luo Feng. He coldly said “And at this time, the leader has already begun to rest.”

“The leader has long wanted to meet him, however there hasn’t been a chance. Today I’ve managed to bring this lord over, of course I brought him here immediately.” The white robed Yu Ke Qi’s expression was serious, ordering, “Are you willing to bear the consequences? Hurry and open the door!”

Luo Feng frowned, communicated, “What’s the matter?”

“Master, normally these two don’t even bother to stop me. However, they are acting a bit strange today.” Yu Ke Qi replied mentally, he was suspicious too.

“Why aren’t you opening the door?” Yu Ke Qi’s expression was ugly Roaring, “What’s up with you two?”

The two guards’ expressions changed.

One of them smiled embarrassedly and said, “Mr Yu, we two brothers don’t actually wish to stop you. Only today, the leader just got his hands on…anyway, it’s not convenient for guests. If he was disturbed, he would very unhappy. If he really wishes to meet this man…we brothers will pass the message?”

“Ah.” The white robed Yu Ke Qi frowned and communicated to Luo Feng, “Master, the leader is currently with a woman, what do we do?”

“Enter!” Luo Feng communicated.

Under the effects of the soul technique, Yu Ke Qi couldn’t reject Luo Feng’s order. Looking at the guard, “Go pass the word! The leader meeting this lord is more important than screwing some woman.”

“Ok.” The two guards immediately opened the door and one of them headed in.

……

Luo Feng stood outside and was looking through the open door.

“Leader, leader.” The guard that went in shouted seriously within the palace.

“What’s the matter?” An enraged voice resounded.

“What’s the matter.” A sweet voice resounded.

“Family leader, Mr Yu has brought someone over. He’s saying that he’s someone you’ve been wanting to meet. Leader, will you meet him?” The guard asked.

“Mr Yu has brought someone?” Suddenly the large door on the 1st level of the palace rumbled open. A casually dressed bare footed tall and sturdy man in a luxurious night gown looked out, his gaze landing on the black robed Luo Feng. He immediately began to grow suspicious.

“Anymore and the plot will be revealed.” Luo Feng became a blur and rushed into the yard.

Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!

9 black silhouettes immediately rushed down from the upper levels of the palace. Simultaneously, silhouettes covered the skies and lands, rushing from all sides of the yard inwards.

The Pure feather family leader, his position was incredibly high and mighty. How could he not have personal bodyguards?

300 bodyguards!

9 great shadow guards!

“There’s actually 9 universe levels, a super power is indeed a super power.” A black robed Luo Feng had a cold expression on. His eyes were ice cold as his arms extended.

The 300 guards and 9 shadow guards that rushed out, were all originally holding battle blades or knives, or their own personal weapons, and were prepared to control them to assassinate Luo Feng. However, under Luo Feng’s powerful spirit energy control, the 300 guards used their own weapons to pierce their own heads!

“No!” The 300 guards and 9 shadow guards, along with the 2 guards at the door stared with fear. However, their strengths weren’t enough to control their own weapons!

Shua!

With flashes of blades, knives, weapons!

311 heads were sliced off. Fresh blood floated in the darkness of the night. Only 3 people remained alive in the yard.

The white robed Yu Ke Qi stood there stupidly and the family leader of the Pure feather family had fear in his eyes. Only Luo Feng’s black robe swished, expressionless.

Shua!

In one step, Luo Feng had already reached beside the leader and grabbed him by the neck, like grabbing a little chicken. Following that, with just one step, his entire being vanished.
