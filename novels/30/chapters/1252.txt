Chapter 1254: A Suggestion from Eastern Emperor Ancestor

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Even if the universe supreme masters were using all the techniques they had, Luo Feng was still completely safe in Boat of Mausoleum. After all, after its recognizing Luo Feng as its master, Luo Feng knew all the power of Boat of Mausoleum, besides, he concentrated on the deal proposed by North True Star Master.

“A deal with me?” Luo Feng was shocked, and thoughts flooded his mind.

Who’s Eastern Emperor Ancestor?

He was the ancestor of the oldest holy land of Universe Ocean, and he was also the richest one.

“What kind of deal?” Luo Feng transmitted his voice.

North True Star Master relieved as he finally got a response as it was better than nothing. North True Star Master transmitted his voice to the surface of Boat of Mausoleum, “First, congratulations for getting the inheritance of Duan Dong River. About the deal, our ancestor said that he needs the inheritance, and inheritance you’re about to get…Of course, the ancestor doesn’t care about the valuables, memory inheritance is all that matters.”

“Memory inheritance?” Luo Feng sneered. “North True Star Master, don’t you think Eastern Emperor Ancestor is overthinking? I got the inheritance after defeating hundreds of thousands of competitors, why does the ancestor think he can just take my inheritance? Don’t even count on it.”

“We can offer everything.” North True Star Master wasn’t angry. He went on saying, “Our race has the oldest holy land out of Universe Ocean, much older than that Purple Moon Holy Land. We also got lots of inheritance, and we even know some hidden secrets of Universe Ocean, and we also have the most supreme true treasures. As long as you say yes, the hidden inheritance, the secrets and even supreme true treasures, just name your price.”

“No deal!” answered Luo Feng.

Luo Feng was indeed tempted by the offer, after all, Universe Ocean was so mysterious and there were so many unknown things. Eastern Emperor Ancestor might know the best. Secrets, supreme true treasures, they were all tempting him. However, memory inheritance was the utmost important thing in Duan Dong River bloodline, and he had made a vow, he couldn’t betray the vow.

North True Star Master said, “It’s just memory inheritance.”

“Say no more. If this is the deal, then don’t think about it,” said Luo Feng.

North True Star Master had expected this to happen. Eastern Emperor Ancestor had already told him that he didn’t have much hope, and he also said that an inheritance that only had one inheritor each generation must have a way to prevent secrets from being let out.

“How about part of the memory inheritance?” asked North True Star Master.

“Part?” Luo Feng didn’t refuse it. “Which part does the ancestor want?”

North True Star Master rejoiced in his heart.

It was good as long as the conversation was still going.

“Of course, the practice experience,” said North True Star Master. “Our ancestor wants the more complicated experience.”

“Your ancestor truly knows what’s the most valuable.” Luo Feng grinned.

Among the memory inheritance, there were ‘three techniques’ left by the three ancestral teachers, which was the core of the core; there was normal core memory inheritance, which was gathered by each generation of Duan Dong River and recorded the experience of other supreme beings; there was also ordinary inheritance, which was made up of over a hundred million memory stones, and they were all basic inheritance, and only few of them could surpass ‘true gold’ level.

Without doubt, extremely complicated practice experience was invaluable. Even the experience from great beings outside Duan Dong River would be included into the core inheritance if it was collected by Duan Dong River. That Eastern Emperor Ancestor wanted that kind of inheritance, which meant he knew how important it was.

Unfortunately, extremely complicated and sophisticated practice memory inheritance was all core, so Luo Feng couldn’t let it out at all.

“Perhaps I can trick him.” Luo Feng thought. “My race doesn’t have a solid foundation, and we don’t have enough valuables. Perhaps I can trick that Eastern Emperor Ancestor into giving me some supreme true treasures, then we humans will be much stronger.” After all, he was the only one who knew about Duan Dong River inheritance.

Which meant it was likely that he could succeed.

And there was no downside even if he failed.

Eastern Emperor Ancestor wouldn’t just rush out. The two ancestors didn’t get out of holy lands during the inheritance in Boat of Mausoleum, and neither did they show up when he was being encircled. Obviously, there was something stopping them from getting out.

Even the inheritance from Duan Dong River didn’t persuade them to get out, not to mention some supreme true treasures.

“Heng, part of the inheritance.” Thoughts flooded Luo Feng’s mind. He said coldly after making up his mind, “Even I can’t give out the inheritance of Duan Dong River. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s possible!” North True Star Master secretly rejoiced as he knew a lot from Eastern Emperor Ancestor.

He immediately added, “Of course, we won’t force you to leak the information that you’re forbidden to leak… Our ancestor only wants the practice experience. Duan Dong River is so ancient, so it must’ve gathered lots of training experience of other supreme beings. You can just exchange those with my race.”

“That ancestor indeed knows a lot.” Luo Feng was shocked. Unfortunately, that Eastern Emperor Ancestor didn’t know that even the training experience of great beings outside Duan Dong River was included in the core inheritance.

“No wonder it’s Eastern Emperor ancestor, he indeed knows a lot,” said Luo Feng. “There’s indeed some experience of great beings outside Duan Dong River.”

North True Star Master got more excited.

“However, there was only inheritance of three supreme beings,” said Luo Feng.

“It might be more than three.” North True Star Master thought to himself, but he didn’t ask more questions.

“Milky Way Horde Leader! Name your price! Our ancestor wants the inheritance from those three great beings,” said North True Star Master.

“We can talk about my price later,” said Luo Feng. “Doesn’t the ancestor know that the memory inheritance that surpasses universe supreme masters is affected by the will of the original universe?”

“Haha, of course, he knows,” said North True Star Master. “However, Duan Dong River should be using something like memory stones to store the information. You’re not powerful enough to know the information, yet our ancestor has already transcended the incarnation… Just give the objects like memory stones to our ancestor, and he can see it.”

Luo Feng was dazed.

That was right.

Though he couldn’t see it, the great beings who transcended incarnations could.

“Can we talk about your price now?” asked North True Star Master.

“Ten supreme true treasures! The hidden inheritance of your race! And the secrets of Universe Ocean!” said Luo Feng.

North True Star Master was shocked.

It was a huge price.

Ten supreme true treasures? Even in Eastern Emperor Holy Land, there were only few supreme true treasures as the ancestors never went out of holy land and only universe masters adventured Universe Ocean… Besides, the supreme true treasures were largely owned by universe masters themselves, so there was only a limited storage. If it was Purple Moon Holy Land, it might need to take supreme true treasures from other universe masters and universe supreme masters.

Even it was Eastern Emperor Holy Land, it might use up all its storage!

“This, this is…” North True Star Master wanted Luo Feng to cut down his price. “Our race knows a lot about secret inheritance and secrets in Universe Ocean.”

“What inheritance? What secrets? Those are just additional things,” yelled Luo Feng. “Do you really think the secret inheritance you know can rival mine? As for secrets? Those are just secrets a long time ago, and I just want to satisfy my curiosity. I have no problem not knowing them.”

North True Star Master felt helpless.

“Ten supreme true treasures it is. Besides, I need one for each category,” said Luo Feng.

North True Star Master was infuriated.

It was not that easy!

Even universe supreme masters needed to fight for supreme true treasures! The supreme masters from Easter Emperor Holy Land were relatively weak as they didn’t have their ‘small universes’ anymore, so they rarely went out. As for universe masters, they couldn’t match other universe supreme masters, so they only had a few supreme true treasures.

Luo Feng wanted ten? Didn’t he understand that even the Divine Eye clan only had around ten supreme true treasures after three universe eras? Especially after the war in Boat of Mausoleum, there weren’t even ten anymore because two true masters died.

“Quickly make your decision. I don’t have time to say long, “said Luo Feng.

“You’re too demanding. I need to ask our ancestor,” said North True Star Master.

“Go, quickly.”

Luo Feng was certain that Eastern Emperor Holy Land could have them as even Divine Eye clan had almost ten supreme true treasures. Besides, several universe masters had supreme true treasures with them this time, so even ten supreme true treasures were still a huge price for Eastern Emperor Holy Land, it didn’t need all universe masters to contribute their supreme true treasures.

…

Eastern Emperor Holy Land.

In the main palace of North True Star Master.

“Ancestor.” North True Star Master looked at Eastern Emperor Ancestor.

“Three?” Eastern Emperor Ancestor wasn’t angry at all, instead, he looked glad. He nodded, “If Luo Feng really has the training experience of three ancient beings, I can totally give him ten supreme true treasures! However, we can’t just say yes like that. We need to talk to him.”

Supreme true treasures?

It had nothing to do with Eastern Emperor Ancestor. The storage in the holy land or the deaths of several universe masters were nothing to the ancestor.

The training experience of those ancient supreme beings were truly valuable to him.

“However, I need to see whether the memory inheritance is actually worthy or not,” said Eastern Emperor Ancestor. “I don’t want him to fool us with fake inheritance and take ten supreme true treasures, otherwise we’ll be a joke.”

North True Star Master felt hurt.

Ten supreme true treasures! There were only around a hundred supreme true treasures in Universe Ocean! Only the ancestors of the two holy lands would be willing to make a deal with ten supreme true treasures.
