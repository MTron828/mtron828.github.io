Chapter 1428: After the Battle

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng stood in the void space with furrowed brows, deep in thought.

“Unexpectedly, it still managed to escape.” Luo Feng wore a heavy expression. “And its power was much stronger than what Nine-Headed Demon Master and Blood Orchid Ancestor told me previously! Seems like, over these past dozen years, it has become much stronger. The worst prediction speculated earlier on has now become reality—by devouring the origins of various miniature universes, it is growing and becoming stronger.”

Luo Feng felt the pressure. This Sector Beast only needed to devour the origins of miniature universes to become stronger. If this situation was allowed to go on, the longer the delay, the scarier this Sector Beast would become.

In regards to this battle, Luo Feng hadn’t been fully confident of winning right from the very start. After all, his Golden Horned Beast body was the one fighting the Sector Beast while only equipped with a few common machine-type treasures. His most precious treasures—like Shi Wu Wings, Wu Qi God, and Star Tower—were all with his Remote Ocean body and his Mosha body.

“Even the combination of Universe Chain and Snowy World wasn’t enough to trap it. My Divine Eye secret technique was also unable to weaken its power… However, it finally showed its true self when it was unable to find an escape route. That was before it dashed out of Chain Universe.”

Luo Feng nodded silently. From this, he could deduce that the Sector Beast had been forced into a corner. Previously, when it had engaged in battle with Nine-Headed Demon Master, even when it needed to escape, it hadn’t shown its true self. Any move that required it to reveal its true self in order to execute it must have been an ultimate move! However, Luo Feng was unsure of whether this was the ultimate move of the Sector Beast—or if there were others he did not know of! After all, he had been unable to apprehend it, and it had managed to get away unscathed.

There might have been some escape tactics that had not been executed. According to the derivation, once the Sector Beast surpassed its gestation period and entered its growth period, a threshold within its body would be crossed. Its main purpose was to breed a large number of powerful warriors for battling purposes. Its role was to breed warriors to carry out destruction, similar to how the primal universe bred billions and trillions of living souls! Thus, Sector Beasts certainly had many survival-focused talents.

“Will it pull any other strange moves?” Luo Feng was worried.

After pondering for a long time, Luo Feng shook his head.

“No matter what, this time around, I managed to force it to reveal its true self, which might mean it is nearing its ultimate limit! And my Golden Horned Beast body’s combat power is not enough. When Remote Ocean body and Mosha body arrive with the various treasures they carry with them, they will be able to display much stronger combat power. Just with Wu Qi God and Blood Ghost Blade, my combat power soars up two levels right away.

“The other team is really much stronger than Golden Horned Beast body alone. Absolute dominance. This time, I was able to force it nearer to its ultimate limit. Even if it does have some other weird tactics, the moment my other team makes a move, the various methods it executes progressively should allow me to suppress its weird tactics. I have 90 percent confidence of being able to apprehend it.”

Taking one look at the vessel beside him, he flew in right away, while the chain trailing behind him also followed suit.

Hua!

Immediately, the vessel tore through space and sped away.

In another area amidst the void space, Sector Beast, Morosa, was on the run. It was escaping with a troubled mind.

A universe master had unexpectedly executed a stronger “willpower attack” than it could! One of the types of moves Sector Beast was highly skilled in was the category of soul attacks. Previously, when the nine true gods, including Firefly True Master, had laid siege to it, with a single soundless scream, everyone—even Nine-Headed Demon Master—had been affected. In regards of willpower, Sector Beast Morosa had been born with the skill to execute soul attacks, and it was certainly much stronger than Nine-Headed Demon Master; when it came to the execution of such attacks, it had already attained the level of an eternal true god.

But in regards to willpower, Luo Feng was on par with it! Its ability to execute soul attacks, however, was purely a gift of its innate talent. Luo Feng, on the other hand had undergone the cultivation of one of the strongest secret techniques of the World of Jin, Divine Eye Secret Technique, which enabled him to get his willpower—which was at the level of an eternal true god—to unleash extremely strong power. This was the role of a secret technique! All these secret techniques could enable powers of similar levels to unleash extremely strong power.

Like the secret technique of blazing godly power! Like the secret technique of willpower!

Also, for those who could create profound secret techniques, they were definitely beings from the ancient civilization who stood at the peak of their times, like the three generations of ancestors and the Godly King of Jin. That Sector Beast might have been talented, but its talent was not as sensational as the Divine Eye Secret Technique, which Luo Feng had successfully cultivated to six scrolls.

“What strong willpower. What a massive godly body. Already able to force me to show my true body.” Sector Beast Morosa’s eyes flashed with killing intent. “That human Luo Feng is definitely the most powerful human I’ve ever met. He was even more powerful than that Nine-Headed Demon Master! However, even though he might be more powerful than me, he is unable to handle me. I was still able to escape from his clutches. If I have no reason to fear this Milky Way Horde Leader, who should I fear?”

Sector Beast Morosa gave a hideous laugh. It might have feared Luo Feng, but Luo Feng was unable to do anything to it!

Just one battle with this Milky Way Horde Leader, and I incurred such a loss, thought Sector Beast Morosa. Next time I see him, I should escape immediately… Within such a short period of time, even if my powers can get any stronger, I will still be at the same level as him. Forget being on par—even if I am a little more powerful than he is, he will still be able to escape from me. So fighting him would be a total waste of energy. Not worth it!

“This time, the amount of power I used up through one battle with him was equivalent to the amount of power I can gain from devouring two origins of miniature universes,” Sector Beast Morosa muttered to himself. “If I ever meet him, I should quickly move away.”

Not only him, but the other powerful eight figures of the Universe Ocean, he thought. Whenever I encounter them, I should steer clear. Even if I come face-to-face with them, I will give way. For now, I shall do my best to devour as many origins of miniature universes as possible to increase my power as quickly as I can. Haha… No matter what, at least when it comes to this Universe Ocean Number One Master, I will be able to face him without fear.

Sou!

With a direct teleportation, Sector Beast Morosa disappeared amidst the chaotic airflow of the void space. This battle had chased away the last trace of worry in Sector Beast Morosa’s mind. Although it dreaded having to face Luo Feng, it no longer feared him. It was already convinced that within Universe Ocean, no one was able to kill it!

Virtual universe, in a particular plane of space that solely belonged to Luo Feng.

In the public square before the palace that was suspended in the starry sky, a group of true gods had gathered. At first glance, there were more than 50 of them! Apparently, other than the human true gods, those who had turned up included the true gods from the Ancestral God School, the Space Beast Alliance, and the various races of the Hong Alliance.

Everyone maintained silence. Before them all, Luo Feng sat cross-legged with eyes shut, unmoving.

Not a single true god dared to disturb him because they all knew that at that very moment, Luo Feng was engaged in a battle with that Sector Beast and was giving it his all. Naturally, they did not want to distract him. This battle with the Sector Beast concerned the survival of countless races within the entire Universe Ocean.

“Will Milky Way be able to kill that Sector Beast?”

“He is sure to succeed.”

“Milky Way Horde Leader is the Universe Ocean Number One Master.”

They were all transmitting messages to one another. Since that first message transmitted by Sea Badger True Master had informed them all that Milky Way Horde Leader was already at its miniature universe and was fighting the Sector Beast, the tension had built up across the entire Universe Ocean! As for the numerous true gods within the primal universe, the majority had rushed over via the virtual universe, including Divine Eye True God and Skeleton Master. They were all using their transmission tokens, waiting to learn the outcome.

Hu!

Sitting cross-legged before the crowd, the white-robed figure of Luo Feng opened his eyes and gently exhaled. Instantly, the large group of true gods looked toward Luo Feng expectantly. Standing at the forefront of the crowd was Primal Chaos City Leader.

“How was it?” Primal Chaos City Leader was quick to ask.

The numerous true gods in the surroundings, including the Old Beast God, were all holding their breath as they waited expectantly.

Gently, Luo Feng shook his head. “It managed to escape.”

“Escaped!”

“What? The Sector Beast has escaped?”

“Even Milky Way Horde Leader was unable to kill the Sector Beast! Then who else can be able to kill Sector Beast?”

At merely a single sentence reply from Luo Feng, and various true gods present instantly collapsed. They were all on edge. If the Sector Beast did not die now, then in the future, it would be their turn to die. All their races would be wiped out.

“Everyone!” Luo Feng looked up. His eyes swept through the crowd as he spoke.

Amidst the anxiety and chaos, the numerous true gods quietened down. They did their best to hold back their anxiety and frustrations to hear Luo Feng out.

“Previously, Nine-Headed Demon Master and others fought the Sector Beast in a battle.” Luo Feng remained seated in his spot as he looked at the numerous true gods before him. “This time around, it was my turn to fight the Sector Beast in a battle. I have discovered some information about this Sector Beast.”

Immediately, every single true god present was all ears, listening intently.

“On top of the various information we discovered previously,” Luo Feng said, “we can first confirm one point. The Sector Beast relies on devouring the origins of miniature universes to increase its power. Currently, its power is comparable to Nine-Headed Demon Master and company. Obviously, it is much stronger than before.”

“Ah!”

“Even stronger?”

“It has become stronger?”

The numerous true gods felt their hearts sink. This was a disastrous piece of news. This proved that the Sector Beast would continue to become more powerful as it fed on more origins of miniature universes. And such an increase would happen at an extremely fast rate!

Luo Feng continued. “The second piece of bad news: Previously, when the Sector Beast was fighting Nine-Headed Demon Master and company, its golden giant form was merely a disguise… While I was fighting it, I forced it to reveal its true form. The look of its actual self should be something like this.”

Luo Feng pointed in midair beside him. Immediately, an image took form showing the appearance of the ugly Sector Beast body, all black in color. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Upon showing its actual body, its two eyes—one on each of its two heads—emitted red light,” Luo Feng said. “These two beams of red light were extremely powerful! This power can be estimated to surpass the normal combat power it usually displays when fighting by around two notches. This was the move that it deployed to escape from me. These are the two main points. The good news is, since we have forced it to show its original form, I suppose it must have reached its ultimate limit.”

Still, the numerous true gods felt heavy-hearted as they listened on. God, this was truly a nightmare.

Through his transmission token, Luo Feng was also transmitting the news over to Divine Eye True Master, Skeleton Master, Jue He Master, Bei Chi Star Master, and many other great beings. Clearly, all of them felt anxious and unsettled upon hearing his report. This was because both were disastrous pieces of information. One meant that the Sector Beast could grow rapidly. The other specified that whenever the Sector Beast took the form of its original body, it would emit red light and then, its combat power would increase by two notches.

“However, there is no cause for worry, everyone,” Luo Feng said. “I can sense that we have our godly power and Sector Beast has its strength. Its strength is not inexhaustible… It was in a battle of strength with me. As we used up more and more of our powers, it finally felt the pinch of exhausting its powers in this manner, so it fled. I even sensed that, towards the end, it was slightly weakened. From this point alone, we can deduce that with a great number of true gods combining their efforts—or with those who possess a great deal of godly power, such as Nine Remoteness True Master—we will be able to deal with it just by using up our godly power alone. Also, I have several other bodies. The battle with the Sector Beast this time was fought by just one of my other bodies, which had not even brought along enough strong treasures. Meaning to say, I have not even revealed my strongest power.”
