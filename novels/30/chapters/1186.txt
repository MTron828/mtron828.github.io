Chapter 1188: Extreme Anxiety

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Five Chaos Master looked at Molten Lava Devil God—who had appeared from the lava ocean high in the sky—and felt something amiss. He was shocked inwardly, as he knew that trouble was brewing, yet he maintained a calm composure. He knew that based on the distance between Molten Lava Devil God and himself, given his ability, he would have enough time to escape to the tangency point deep within that underground maze to teleport himself away.

The surrounding space was frozen, thus disabling teleportation. Likewise, at the entrance of the underground maze, teleportation was impossible. Only at the deepest area of the cave, waves were gradually showing. One had to reach a tangent position before escape was possible.

“How lucky that human was,” said Five Chaos Master. “If Molten Lava Devil God had not appeared, I would give him a taste of my Five Beasts Great Extermination.”

Five Chaos Master set his standards high. Out of all the new generation universe masters of the primal universe, only the top-notch ones had fought against him. To him, even Star River Master was no threat. Star River Master, a weird, unique life-form, was barely comparable to him in battle. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Only Primal Chaos City Leader was able to earn some of his respect. Primal Chaos City Leader’s human godly body was comparatively smaller, but he was able to go head-on with Five Chaos Master’s Five Beast Great Extermination!

Five Beast Great Extermination was a fusion technique composed of the most powerful techniques of the Five Beast Gods Path! Executed together with his precious and rare true treasure… the power was so great that it was unbelievable. He had spent more one reincarnation era to bring this technique to completion, yet Primal Chaos City Leader was able to fight him all the same. To him, the only one from the primal universe who could hope to become a universe supreme master was none other than Primal Chaos City Leader.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

A few thoughts flashed through his mind. Five Chaos Master was about to turn and make a rapid escape when he suddenly felt an endless, golden, blazing flame in his surroundings, suppressing and squashing him relentlessly. He felt as if countless ropes were binding and tying him up.

“What!” Five Chaos Master turned his head in disbelief as he looked at Luo Feng behind him.

If there were no obstructions, he could escape. Yet with this terrifying obstruction, he had no time at all.

From his Golden Kingdom, Luo Feng’s voice resonated in the ears of Five Chaos Master, Yin Tuo, and Ultimate Arrow Master. “No one leaves!”

“Human Silver Wings Horde Leader, are you out of your mind?” Ultimate Arrow Master had been calm about killing Luo Feng but was now on tenterhooks. It was not worth it—not at the expense of his life. He was not willing to die.

“Silver Wings Horde Leader, I have already given up going after your life!” the golden horned lizard shouted in anxiety. “You should not stop me further. They want to kill you, not me.”

Five Chaos Leader was staring coldly. Apparently, he was extremely furious. “Silver Wings Horde Leader, are you thinking of perishing together?”

“Perishing together?” Luo Feng said. He was flying at lightning speed. “The obstacles you all are facing now are helpful boosters to me. This is my territory. Haha, of course you are the ones to die while I live! Five Chaos Master… I heard you have another body, but I’m afraid even your strongest body would go crazy if you lose this precious and rare true treasure that you have painstakingly spent three reincarnation eras to gather to completion.”

“We die, and you live?” Five Chaos Master’s voice was transmitted to Golden Kingdom. “What arrogance. Once I execute Five Chaos Sector, together with my Water Ripple Prison, I would be able to bring you under complete suppression, unless you execute your Miniature Universe… But even if you did, Five Chaos Sector and Miniature Universe would perish together. Thereafter, I would be sure to execute it again. You and I will be in a standoff; by then, no one will be able to escape. I have lived for close to three reincarnation eras. It is nothing having to see my end, but it’s different for you. How long have you lived so far? Life’s too short, and perishing with me now is simply not worth it.”

“Silver Wings Horde Leader, it is now more important to escape for dear life,” Ultimate Arrow Master added.

“Yes, yes, yes, making it out alive is more important!” said Yin Tuo, filled with anxiety.

“Haha! You have another body, and so do I,” said Luo Feng. “A standoff it shall be. At most… we die together!”

Luo Feng continued to fly at lightning speed.

While description might take some time, when it came to communication with powers at their level, the speed of interactive transmission via godly power was so incredibly fast that it was intimidating. And the speed of Molten Lava Devil God was equally intimidating! Its power had attained an unbelievable level. Even universe supreme masters with supreme true treasures would become flustered and run away the moment they saw him. This was enough to know his might. He was even referred to as a human form supreme true treasure as he had reached the level of “force against technique.” All kinds of laws were meaningless to it, and its speed had reached a limit that far exceeded 100 times light speed. Its speed had exceeded thousands and millions of times the light speed.

Just as he was emerging from within the lava ocean—

Hong!

Both legs landed on the endless, black, rocky land. One stomp of this lofty Molten Lava Devil Monster—a towering figure of 10 million kilometers—was mightier than any other celestial rock by thousands and millions of times.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

Endless black rocks from the large surrounding domains were bashed to pieces in an instant.

Pa! Pa! Pa!

A large gully cracked open a distance away. At the same time, a surrounding area of a few billion kilometers meters of the black rocky land had completely sunken down by a few million kilometers. The impact of his single step was so strong that many caves and tunnels of the underground mazes deep beneath the affected land gave way and collapsed.

One, single step… It was as though he had trampled on the hearts and souls of Five Chaos Master, Yin Tuo, and Ultimate Arrow Master. All of them were filled with anxiety!

“Human, you really want to perish together?” Five Chaos Master demanded. His eyes looked murderous. This was his master body for battles, and he had brought along with him various precious true treasures, just like how Luo Feng had Star Tower and Shi Wu Wings with him. It was the same for Five Chaos Master. It would drive him crazy to be annihilated.

“Human, hurry, hurry, hurry!” Ultimate Arrow Master was mad with worry.

Yin Tuo was truly worried. “Silver Wings Horde Leader, I have given up trying to kill you. Why are you insisting of dragging me to doomsday with you?”

Although they were all crazy, the idea of dying at the hands of Molten Lava Devil God was too great an injustice for them.

Instead of heeding their words, Luo Feng jested, “If we all die together, we will have forged a friendship of life and death.”

Five Chaos Master gazed at Molten Lava Devil God in the distance. Actually, Molten Lava Devil God was still very far away. Due to his massive godly body, he could clearly be seen even extremely far away. The distance might have been very far, but with his ability to use “force against technique,” and that speed of his, which exceeded 100 times light speed by thousands and millions of times, Five Chaos Master was burning with anxiety.

Five Chaos Master’s face grew distorted, and his eyes flashed murderous intentions. Through gritted teeth, he said, “Silver Wings Horde Leader, if you continue to fight, we will all perish. And I swear… I, Five Chaos, will come after you and hunt every single body of yours to death. Every body of yours that I see, I will hack to death!”

“I welcome your attacks,” Luo Feng taunted. “The pressure you give me will be a good way for me to hone my skills. With such honing, I will be able to trample on you in the future, and I shall enter the hall of universe supreme masters.”

Ultimate Arrow Master appeared conflicted. This annoying human was still in the mood for jokes in this life-and-death situation! But he was also aware that… for him to be joking at this moment—to even be able to laugh—it meant Luo Feng must have made his decision and would not change his mind further.

“I—I—I do not…” Yin Tuo stammered anxiously.

“You wanted to kill me for my treasure not long ago, isn’t that so?” said Luo Feng. “At this point, you’re still thinking of escaping, but it’s too late.”

Luo Feng threw a glance at the golden horned lizard behind him, and at the same time, he saw the immeasurably towering, gigantic Molten Lava Devil God. It was very far away, yet Luo Feng could still feel a pressure exerted by its towering figure.

“Ah! Ah! Aah!” Five Chaos Master wailed, burning with rage. Oh, how angry and furious he was! This young fellow, whom he had no trouble killing before now, was thinking of dragging him to hell’s gate. He did not want to meet his downfall at the hands of this young upstart, so he had to tolerate him!

“Silver Wings Horde Leader, we should escape together,” he said. “Release the domain’s suppression over me. I swear I will not pursue you, and I will give you a pinnacle true treasure.”

Five Chaos Master was really trying to compromise because time was of the essence. In the distance, Molten Lava Devil God was approaching at lightning speed. Its huge legs were stepping on the endless, black, rocky land, and every step was a step of destruction; his attack was more terrifying than any other universe supreme master.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Gallop, trample—the endless rocky land was trembling.

“Silver Wings Horde Leader!” Five Chaos Master stared at Luo Feng. At this moment, his eyes inevitably betrayed the hint of a plea. For someone so arrogant like him to lower himself… this was not easy for him at all. Yet he was unwilling to give up everything precious that he had spent three reincarnation eras accumulating.

“Hurry! We do not have time to waste!” Ultimate Arrow Master was pleading anxiously. “Silver Wings Horde Leader! Silver Wings Horde Leader!”

“Why didn’t I hurry off earlier when I still could?” lamented Yin Tuo. “I should never have stayed behind to watch the crossfire between Luo Feng and Five Chaos Master. Being a busybody, now I have to pay with my life.”

“Hahaha…” laughed Luo Feng. Earlier, he had been joking and teasing; suddenly, his eyes burned with murderous intent. His face became dark and frightening. “The almighty Five Chaos Master is actually begging. How interesting. Dream on. Previously, I allowed you to trample on me in any way you liked, but did the thought of just letting me go ever occur to you? Now you want to leave? Too late!”

“We did give you chances previously!” Ultimate Arrow Master quickly protested.

“Chances? Those were chances? You told me to leave my palace true treasure and wings true treasure. Then you would spare my life?” Luo Feng sneered. “Very well, Five Chaos Master… You shall hand over ‘Forbidden Temple’ and ‘Extermination Godly Armor.’ Then I will let you go! As for you, Ultimate Arrow Master, you shall hand over ‘Core of Blade Sector,’ and I will let you go. Yin Tuo, you shall hand over ‘Golden Sulphone Armor’! I will spare your life!”

Five Chaos Master, Ultimate Arrow Master, and Yin Tuo went silent—especially Five Chaos Master. Water Ripple Prison was a pinnacle domain true treasure while Forbidden Temple was a pinnacle palace true treasure. Extermination Godly Armor was his life… It was more precious that Water Ripple Prison and Forbidden Temple put together; it was comparable to a unique object.

“Didn’t you all say you gave me chances?” said Luo Feng. “I am now giving you all chances, too. Your chances are here. Take them.” His eyes were filled with jest and indifference.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Molten Lava Devil God’s footwork was extremely fast. Every step could cover at least 10 billion kilometers. He was within eyesight now.

Molten Lava Devil God was becoming bigger and bigger, which made Five Chaos Leader increasingly anxious—so anxious that he was losing his sanity. He wished he could devour Luo Feng bite by bite. He wanted to bite off mouthfuls of Luo Feng’s flesh and bones and suck his blood dry!

This loathsome Luo Feng! Five Chaos Master was raging in his heart.

“Don’t you think of going out of here alive!” Five Chaos Master suddenly roared.

Behind him, a single-eyed shadow released an endless light, inducing a change between the heavens and the earth, which transformed into a world of Five Chaos Sector within an instant. Water Ripple Prison was executed once again. Together with Five Chaos Sector, Luo Feng’s Golden Kingdom and Blazing Flames Ocean were annihilated in an instant. Yet Luo Feng maintained his sickening smile and executed Miniature Universe.

An endless chaotic airflow spread out. On the one hand, there was Five Chaos Sector and Water Ripple Prison. On the other hand, there was Golden Kingdom, Miniature Universe, and Blazing Flames Ocean.

The two were crazily entangled, with Miniature Universe and Five Chaos Sector constantly colliding against one another.

Peng!

Both were shattered into shards and pieces. However, they had been fighting for only a split second. Molten Lava Devil God had progressed to dangerously close by.

Near Molten Lava Devil God, the golden horned lizard said in a voice filled with despair, “It is too late now.”
