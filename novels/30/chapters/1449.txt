“The biggest enemy?” Luo Feng was terrified.

“Yes!” said Morosa. “Master, you should know that every Sector Beast is very proud of themselves, as all of them think Sector Beasts are the noblest creatures in Universe Ocean. However, I am working for you now. Being furious or intimidated by your power, they will treat you as their ultimate enemy, and they might even join forces to fight you. They’re already evolving at peak speed now. Master, you can’t waste any time.”

“How much time do we I have?” Luo Feng asked, frowning.

“Originally, it will take at least several trillion eras for the ultimate king to be born,” said Morosa. “As for now, it might only take around several hundred thousand eras. Besides… Master, you should act as soon as possible because the Sector Beast standing at the peak grows the fastest. Beddy is now at level four, and if it keeps swallowing, it can totally reach level five in ten eras. And in the next hundred eras, it is likely to reach level six! And when it reaches level six, it’ll kill all the other Sector Beasts as soon as possible. Which is why, master, you’d better act soon. Ideally, in the next era. The sooner, the better.”

Luo Feng was pondering what Morosa had just said.

“Okay.”

In World of Jin, far away the godly powered avatar of Luo Feng was still in the military camp of the East Army.

“Has it begun?” whispered the godly powered avatar. “The five laws of Sector Beasts. It’s indeed a catastrophe.”

He then triggered the ring of military points on his wrist.

Weng!

The space around him changed, and it became a vast world of military arms. A golden being arrived and said respectfully, “Mister Milky Way.”

The godly powered avatar nodded. “Give me a list of all the true god level valuables.”

Although there had been more than one trillion eras, Luo Feng hadn’t made a large amount of exchanges yet. There were many different valuables within the human race, but those only cost Luo Feng a small part of his military credits. He had obtained a large number of military points from Swan Queen and Fire-Polishing Wu. However, he hadn’t exchanged them for valuables yet, as he wanted to prepare for the Sector Beast crisis and obtain valuables that were actually helpful for the situation.

Now, he had obtained lots of information from Morosa, so he could convert the military credits into valuables useful for dealing with Sector Beasts. Besides, he could always resort to the Godly King of Jin in Wu Qi Tower, and it wouldn’t be difficult for him to get a valuable.

In Milky Way Holy Land in the original universe.

Hong! Long! Long!

The space cracked as if the apocalypse was coming. A space-and-time portal was formed. Luo Feng, dressed in a white cape, stood there, manipulating everything.

“Freeze.”

A giant but dark door was floating there. It was the entrance of the universe portal, which led to the miniature universe of Luo Feng.

Luo Feng gave an order. “Guard the portals. Don’t let anyone damage it.”

“Yes,” answered the three true gods and over 100 universe masters.

Luo Feng nodded, feeling relieved. In the time since he had enslaved Morosa, he had built three universe portals after returning to the original universe, and they were all portals leading to his miniature universe. To the great beings from the human race, they all thought that Luo Feng had the biggest chance of transcending incarnations!

Luo Feng’s miniature universe was indeed enormous—1,000 times larger than those of great beings at the same level! Which meant it was able to accommodate far more great beings. When this universe era was over, many humans would move to the miniature universe of Luo Feng, so three portals were far from enough.

“You guys are responsible for everything in Milky Way Holy Land now,” said Luo Feng. “You can decide on the common issues, and if something important comes up, report it to Primal Chaos City Leader. From now on, I won’t see anyone until I come out.”

“Yes,” the great beings answered.

Luo Feng turned around, took a step, and disappeared from the space. He had already entered Star Tower, where he began the most crucial training.

Inside Star Tower, Luo Feng sat with his legs crossed, contemplating.

I need to get to the hive of the Sector Beasts as soon as possible, he thought. I’d better leave in one era, and in this era, I must finish “Undying River!”

This crisis concerned billions of races in Universe Ocean. Luo Feng didn’t care about the other races, but he held the human race and the earthlings dear. To protect his teachers and family, Luo Feng was willing to die, if that was what it took.

If I can finish Undying River, I can revive myself even if I get killed. I can’t lose this fight. I have to finish Undying River.

Luo Feng closed his eyes and started to practice one of the three secret techniques of Duan Dong River: Undying River.

Before completing Undying River, Luo Feng wouldn’t dare to journey to the horrendous hive of Sector Beasts. After all, there were over ten million Sector Beasts in the hive. If they teamed up and attacked him, he would be easily annihilated. When the quantity was large enough, it could make up for the quality.

******

Time passed. One year after another went by.

Beside the black-striped stone pillar, time was passing ten million times faster than outside, and Luo Feng kept exploiting his potential. He kept perfecting his comprehension and techniques, studying the Divine Eye Secret Technique and Lie Yuan Technique. Although he wasn’t strong enough to practice Lie Yuan Technique, he needed to comprehend it, and then, when his willpower reached the holy level, he would be able to finish practicing it in one shot.

Wu Qi God, Shi Wu Wing, and Star Tower… These were three of his most important valuables, so he needed to pay more attention to them.

Inside Luo Feng’s miniature universe.

Inside the chaos air, Luo Feng, clothed in a white cape, was walking among the air. He quickly entered the origin of the universe.

Luo Feng looked at the 100,000 stars floating in the space of origin, and the whirlpool space at the center of the 100,000 stars. He smiled and waved his hands, and a drop of golden blood appeared. There was golden light gleaming on the blood, and there seemed to be a screen of light covering it. Engravings flowed on the screen.

“This drop of blood contains my complete life imprint,” muttered Luo Feng. “If I die, this drop of blood will be able to absorb energy, and I can be revived. I can only make one drop of Undying River blood in over 1,000 years.”

Luo Feng looked at that drop of blood, which flew into the whirlpool space. It kept spinning relentlessly in the whirlpool like all those 100,000 stars.

“One drop is enough. Even if I die, I can still be revived with this drop. When I am resurrected, I’ll just make another drop of blood.”

Luo Feng turned around and left the space of origin.

******

1,890 years after Luo Feng enslaved the Sector Beast, two beings stood in the space outside Milky Way Holy Land.

“Are you going to go to the hive of the Sector Beasts alone without telling anyone?” Primal Chaos City Leader was surprised.

“No need to tell anyone else.” Luo Feng shook his head. “If I succeed, then let’s tell others. But if I fail, we had better not tell anyone…”

“Don’t you need to say goodbye to your family…?” Primal Chaos City Leader asked, hesitating.

“No need.” Luo Feng shook his head. “I am just here to tell you, Teacher, that I’ll be alive whether I succeed or not. There’s no need to worry my wife and family members. Only you should know about it, teacher.”

Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. Luo Feng then stopped talking, then took a step and disappeared.

Primal Chaos City Leader stood in space, silent for a while. Then he whispered, “Please, come back alive!”

Even though Luo Feng had said with certainty that he would come back alive, Primal Chaos City Leader was still worried sick. It was the hive of Sector Beasts, after all.

On that day, Luo Feng left for the hive of the Sector Beasts. Other than Primal Chaos City Leader, none of the great beings in Universe Ocean knew about it.

In the vast Universe Ocean, Star Tower was progressing forward, teleporting. The destination was the fourth Land of Extremis, the World of Jin. He had chosen to go in the 1,890th year because the World of Jin would be opened again at this time, meaning he could enter again. He had decided to go to the World of Jin and convert his military credits into lots of valuables first.

“Morosa.” Luo Feng looked at Morosa at his side. Morosa was all he had now.

“Master,” said Morosa. “You’re going to the World of Jin now. I can travel there with you. However, when you go to the Land of Darkness, I can no longer enter. All the Sector Beasts would be able to sense my presence… If I go there, it means I leak your presence to all the Sector Beasts. I need to stay in Universe Ocean so I can sense the traces of the Sector Beasts. Then I can notify you at any time.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Luo Feng nodded.

After he brought back the valuables from the World of Jin, he would put the Sector Beast in his miniature universe. No matter how far he was from the miniature universe, he could know exactly what happened there. If Morosa spoke in the miniature universe, he would know, even if he was in Land of Darkness.

“Wait,” asked Luo Feng. “Morosa, I’m going to the Land of Darkness now. If you’re not going with me, you can go to Purple Moon Holy Land. I’ll arrange for one of my godly powered avatars to position Boat of Mausoleum outside Purple Moon Holy Land. No one in Purple Moon Holy Land can do anything about Boat of Mausoleum… In your Boat of Mausoleum, just start swallowing—swallowing that Purple Moon Holy Land. As you swallow Purple Moon Holy Land, you can also sense what is going on in the hive of Sector Beasts, and you can also tell my godly powered avatar. When my godly powered avatar knows, I’ll know about it as well.”

“Okay.” Morosa was eager, as it craved delicious food.

Luo Feng’s eyes glinted ferociously. Purple Moon Holy Land was of no use when it came to dealing with Sector Beasts. Now that it was useless, and since Purple Moon Holy Land was already his mortal enemy, he would just get rid of it.

“However, it’ll take me a long time to swallow the origin of Purple Moon Holy Land,” said Morosa. “Purple Moon Holy Land is more powerful than the miniature universes of normal true gods, and it has strong resistance. I can only swallow it 1/100th as fast as miniature universes of true gods, and it’s enormous. It might take me a long time to completely swallow it—perhaps 100,000 years.”
