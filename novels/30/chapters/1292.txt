Chapter 1293: The Great Change

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng teleported himself to appear within the hall and looked around him, where various figures were appearing successively after teleportation. A short moment later—including Primal Chaos City Leader, who was standing high above—a total of 19 universe masters appeared. All the human universe masters were present. Not even one was absent.

Luo Feng was in awe. There were a few universe masters who had remained in the original universe. But now, the “avatars sustained by godly powers” of these few universe masters had all rushed over.

“What is going on? Teacher has actually summoned all the universe masters of the human race.” Luo Feng was feeling the pressure. Even when they were out battling against the united force of the three races, this was something that had never happened before—all the human universe masters gathering together in one place.

At that time, within the hall, everyone wore heavy expressions. Silence. None of the universe masters spoke.

An invisible pressure caused every single universe master to feel heavy-hearted as they looked toward Primal Chaos City Leader.

“Everyone!” Primal Chaos City Leader said. He walked down the stairs, looked around at the numerous universe masters, and slowly said, “The situation has undergone a great change.”

“What change?” Long Yan Master could not help asking.

“Primal Chaos City Leader, what has happened?”

“What is the exact situation now?”

“Teacher!”

One by one, the universe masters spoke up. Even Luo Feng was asking persistently. This scene apparently had all the universe masters on pins and needles.

Primal Chaos City Leader said solemnly, “I just received news that a large number of scattered races…”

Luo Feng and the rest suddenly felt knots in their stomachs. The universe masters of the scattered races were the key to the final battle this time around! The human camp and the united force camp… Who could obtain enough support? The winner would be in a more advantageous position. Judging by the situation, could it be that most of the scattered races were turning to the united force camp?

“A total of 282 powerful races, close to 10,000 ordinary races, and a tremendous number of weak races…” Primal Chaos City Leader said in a solemn tone. “They must be forming an alliance secretly!”

“What!”

“An alliance?”

“The scattered races are forming an alliance?”

Suddenly, the hall was in an uproar. Luo Feng and everyone else was shocked.

Those billions of scattered races—the so-called “ordinary races” and “weak races”—all lacked strength. Like the golden horned race that was living in the human territory in great numbers, none of these races had a single universe master. This was why they lived precariously within the universe. Most lived as vassal races, relying on the stronger races or even relying on pinnacle races for survival. So even though it was said to have a total of billions of races, the actual total was mainly composed of the alliances of the 282 powerful races!

“How did it turn out to be like this?”

“How can such a thing happen?”

“The scattered races. These—these scattered races! How dare they form an alliance? They think they can actually combine forces?”

At that moment, there was chaos in the hall. Everyone was shocked and flustered.

This was earth-shattering news for them all! Previously, there were nine top powers in the primal universe. Every top power, like the Hong Alliance and the Bug Clan Alliance, had a total of around 40 universe masters. The Northern Territory Alliance had the greatest number of universe masters, but it was, at most, around 100, and they were dispersed all over! This was why it was always considered relatively quiet in the primal universe.

A combination of the various scattered races was difficult to fathom. Their territories were scattered in all corners of the primal universe, and some bore extreme hatred for one another. Combining forces?

The human camp and the united forces camp had never considered this before! After all, within such an extremely short period of time, for countless scattered races to combine forces… That would be something very difficult to achieve.

“282 powerful races. Just… just how many universe masters would there be?” Ice Mountain Master could not help asking.

“How is that even possible?” Luo Feng was also in disbelief.

Forming an alliance was easier said than done. It implicated many races, as well as their grudges, benefits, interests, and conflicts. Who had higher status? Who was lower? Who would be the leader?

Primal Chaos City Leader said in a solemn tone, “This has already happened, and it will be made public soon. Previously, the scattered races were not under such great pressure, but now, under the influence of the two camps forcing them to choose sides… Naturally, some of these universe masters do not wish to take particular sides but were worried that if they choose to stand alone, they would be too weak. That is why races start to rope in universe masters to form cliques.

“Although these signs appeared earlier, I didn’t take them seriously. Who would have thought that within such a short time, an entire alliance could take shape? And… the alliance master of this alliance is none other than Shi Hua Island Leader!”

The moment this was said, everyone within the hall was shocked into a daze.

Shi Hua Island Leader?

Shi Hua Island Leader was one of the supreme masters who traveled alone and had always been so mysterious. Out of all the supreme masters, Shi Hua Island Leader, Sitting Mountain Guest, and Northern Territory Alliance Master were known as the three most mysterious ones. Such a mysterious fellow would actually become an alliance master of a super alliance?

“This super alliance consists of six major groups of secondary powers and some other smaller groups of powers,” Primal Chaos City Leader said seriously. “There is a total of 282 powerful races, and the total number of universe masters exceeds 400! And the human camp and united forces camp have seen a number of universe masters leaving us to join that super alliance.”

“Leaving the camps?” Luo Feng and the other universe masters’ expressions became more twisted.

“Primal Chaos City Leader, how many universe masters have left the human camp?” Deserted Mirror Master quickly asked.

With a nod, Primal Chaos City Leader replied, “As you all know, the vassal races that turned to us were, after all, reliant on us! During a war, we can reasonably detain a number of these universe masters as hostages in our original universe. But when the war ended with the united force of the three races, we certainly had no reason to not allow them back into the primal universe.

“Previously… they were faced with two tough choices, but after many struggles, they finally decided to turn to us. But when this alliance was secretly being built up, it also got in touch with the universe masters who turned to us and the united force camp, respectively. Just a little persuasion was enough to get these universe masters to turn their backs on us.

“Some time ago, the total number of universe masters in our human camp had risen to over 180. But now, including myself, we only have 162, and there are still universe masters coming forward to bid farewell.” Primal Chaos City added with a sigh, “When they choose to leave, how is the human camp able to stop them?”

Dead silence.

Luo Feng and the other universe masters were all devastated.

Earlier on, when the scattered races chose to support the human camp, they were merely turning to the humans as the humans had given them certain promises. But it was not possible for them to sell themselves to the humans forever! These scattered races had already fought a battle for the humans, and without even asking for any benefits, they left. Even if they were not allowed to leave, they would fly out from the ‘original universe’ and into the Universe Ocean.

Now it seems like the humans wanted to kill them all. If the humans really dared to do so, this would blow up into an even greater furor.

******

There was only silence within the hall. Not one of the 19 universe masters spoke a word. Everyone was at a loss for words.

Finally, it was once again Primal Chaos City Leader who got the ball rolling.

“Within the past few days, major groups of powers from Universe Ocean have gotten in touch with us.” Primal Chaos City Leader said. “They were all asking for the guidance from the ancient civilization to learn about how they could cultivate to transcend reincarnation. Among them, many knew about the influence of the willpower of the origin of the primal universe. So they are requesting the cultivation experiences to learn about how they could cultivate to reach the ultimate limit of a universe supreme master. And they are all willing to trade these experiences with supreme true treasures.”

The various top groups within the Universe Ocean were all very powerful. Like the Divine Eye Clan, the Skeleton Clan, and many others—all of them had several universe supreme masters. For them to take out a supreme true treasure to trade for the cultivation experiences on how to cultivate to reach the ultimate limit of a universe supreme master, they would be most willing to oblige! After all, when confronted with doomsday, who would still be unwilling to give up their true treasures?

“Those loathsome powers of Universe Ocean just have to choose this most critical moment to negotiate with us,” Void Gold Master said coldly. “They know that we are in a difficult situation now.”

“This is precisely why they are here to tempt us, because we are in such a predicament,” Darkness Master said in a low voice.

“Not only them…” Luo Feng started to say. “Not too long ago, that East Emperor Holy Land contacted me again.”

“East Emperor Holy Land?”

Suddenly, everyone looked at Luo Feng.

The humans were unwilling to strike deals with other groups of powers because giving out part of their inheritance to these other groups of powers, they would most probably be shaping a powerful opponent for themselves in future! But East Emperor Holy Land was different. Because East Emperor Holy Land already had an existence that transcended reincarnation. He already had the experience of cultivating to the ultimate limit of a universe supreme master.

Even if the humans were to give snippets of a part of that experience, it would just be icing on the cake for them! And there was no influence or effect on the human race at all.

“East Emperor Ancestor is very sly and greedy.” Luo Feng sighed and shook his head. “It is not going to be easy trying to get another supreme true treasure from him.”

“He is just doing this because he knows that we humans are in a predicament now,” Remote Lord Master said through gritted teeth.

Every top power within the Universe Ocean was coveting after the same thing. It was just that they could not get themselves involved, so they could only wait for the critical opportunity at that right moment when the humans were stuck in a predicament. Then they would make use of the temptation of a supreme true treasure! After all, most of the top powers within the Universe Ocean mainly sought to form a coalition with the humans. The others like the united forces camp were completely off their lists.

As for loaning the united forces camp with a supreme true treasure? They were worried that would be the last time they set eyes on their treasures!

“We’ll wait!” Primal Chaos City Leader said in a low tone. “We can only wait.”

“Wait for the response when this super alliance is formed by all those scattered races put together! Before that, just a single race alone will certainly lack the clout to demand anything from us. But now… they have more than 400 universe masters, which is much more than the united forces camp! This is a strength that could truly influence the outcome of the final war, or, in other words, whichever side they decide to take. That will be the winning side!

“Now they have enough clout. Especially that Shi Hua Island Leader. So soundlessly he became an alliance master of a super alliance. For this mysterious Shi Hua Island Leader to make it this far, it will be impossible for him to want nothing more. What does he want? He must have a goal in mind.”

“So—this super alliance will make a move very soon,” Primal Chaos City Leader said with much solemness.

Luo Feng and the others all nodded with heavy hearts. Actually, everyone could guess that, with enough influence, their opponents would definitely have requirements of extremely high expectations! Must the humans really oblige? If they did not give what was requested, what if more than 400 universe masters joined the united forces camp instead? To the human race, this would be a great catastrophe!

Within the demons’ territory, Blood Tooth Star.

Bouts of intentions were falling upon this star, and the avatar of Black Lotus Master, who was from the Northern Territory Alliance, was here. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Loathsome. How dare they, these weak little groups of powers—inferior groups of powers—how dare they combine forces! Forming such a super alliance and causing some universe masters who have originally turned to our united forces camp to detach themselves from our camp. They cannot be stopped, nor can they be persuaded!

“Shi Hua, Shi Hua, this fellow, Shi Hua… I should have realized that he had such extraordinary methods. I would never have expected him to be able to come up with such a super alliance. Coming up with such a super alliance is an extraordinary feat. My guess is, with Huge Axe’s annihilation, he may have foreseen the imminent situations, so he must have started planning this in the dark for quite some time.”

“Now, the initiative lies in the hands of this super alliance.”

“Let’s just wait and see.”

“Let’s wait to see what this super alliance is up to.”

The united force camp and the human camp were both caught off guard.

Half a month later, the super alliance was established, and formal news was publicly announced to the entire primal universe. This super alliance was named “Freedom Alliance,” and once established, it would become the leading power within the primal universe right away.
