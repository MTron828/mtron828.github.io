Chapter 1342: The Other End of the Wormhole

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Inside Boat of Mausoleum, Luo Feng looked shocked. His body shook.

Primal Chaos City Leader realized something was wrong. “What happened, Luo Feng?” he asked.

“The Mosha body I sent in died,” said Luo Feng.

He was terrified. Even if there were some dangerous places in Universe Boat and Tilted Peak Sector that couldn’t be inspected, they were vacuums, meaning they couldn’t be inspected. Luo Feng could at least sense that there were dangers.

However, his domain could detect everywhere in that giant object, yet he had still been killed under that situation! And the pinnacle true treasure palace was also shattered without a trace! Even the energies in the origin of Shi Wu Wing made some sort of sound when slashing pinnacle true treasure palaces into pieces.

“Died? How?” asked Primal Chaos City Leader.

“It must be wind,” said Luo Feng.

“Must be?” Primal Chaos City Leader was dazed.

“I didn’t see it at all, so I couldn’t detect it.” Luo Feng shook his head. “My domain type true treasure worked perfectly fine and was able to inspect everywhere. The wind just came out of nowhere. My pinnacle true treasure palace and my godly body were both shattered, and Mosha body died. He couldn’t fight. Not even a little bit.”

Primal Chaos City Leader was shocked. Even pinnacle true treasure palaces couldn’t resist it? Then everyone who went would be doomed unless he had a supreme true treasure.

******

Eight universe masters from the Hong Alliance entered to conduct a search. Luo Feng had gone in through the crack between the lips. He had gone in first and had died first.

The following day, another universe master died. On the fourth day, two other universe masters died. On the fifth day, another universe master died.

In the ten days following Mosha Luo Feng’s death, the other bodies of the seven universe masters from the Hong Alliance all died. Nobody survived, which terrified all the universe masters from the Hong Alliance. Even the three Lands of Extremis weren’t that incredible.

In the palace of Boat of Mausoleum, the last universe master who had gone in had died, and the universe masters were discussing this heatedly.

“Milky Way Horde Leader was met with a wind that couldn’t be detected. Once that wind blew, the pinnacle true treasure palace he was in was annihilated. As for Xue He Master, he was met with fire that came out of nowhere, which immediately burned the pinnacle true treasure palace. As for other universe masters…”

By wind, fire, or mist, seven had died instantly without even putting up a fight. One had encountered water stretching out and freezing the time and space around him so that nobody could teleport or flee. The water had easily eroded the pinnacle true treasure palace, killing the universe master sitting inside.

“Everyone,” said Primal Chaos City Leader.

They all became quiet and looked at Primal Chaos City Leader.

“Based on the information I have, it’s not just the great beings from the Hong Alliance who have died,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Even great beings from other powers who journeyed in and entered the endless abyss couldn’t find the route, and they couldn’t clearly see the environment around them. They were all trapped in the abyss and were killed by the fire, wind, or other forces that showed up out of nowhere in the abyss… Even supreme true treasure palaces were destroyed. Not to mention pinnacle true treasure palaces.”

“Supreme true treasure palace?” Everyone was stunned.

“I just received the news,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “The skeleton race from the first universe era sent a great being in a supreme true treasure palace. He was met with fire, which burned the palace instantly. He couldn’t resist it in the slightest.”

Everyone was shocked. Luo Feng sighed. It had burned a supreme true treasure palace? Some designs in Boat of Mausoleum could indeed kill some great beings hiding in supreme true treasure palaces. However, they couldn’t destroy a supreme true treasure palace. The abyss in this gigantic object, on the other hand, had done just that.

“Even supreme true treasures can’t resist it. What can we do about it?”

“Literally nobody has survived. The death rate isn’t that high even in Lands of Extremis.”

Primal Chaos City Leader suddenly yelled over their panic, “Everyone!”

Luo Feng looked to his teacher in surprise. All the other great beings in the palace did so as well.

“I just heard the news,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Several powers from the first universe era have entered the natural wormhole in the endless abyss.”

Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed. While he was inspecting the object, he had also found a natural wormhole, yet he hadn’t dared to go in. Instead, he had kept moving forward.

It seemed that those from the first universe era were in more of a hurry, as they had dared to enter the wormhole. Chances were, it hadn’t ended well. Otherwise, they couldn’t have spread the news.

“What’s on the other side of the natural wormhole?” asked Xue He Master.

The other seven universe masters had also found the natural wormhole. No matter how they entered the giant object—through the ears, the nostrils, or the mouth—they had all entered the endless abyss and continued right past the giant wormhole.

“Enter the natural wormhole!” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “It’ll lead to a secret place full of chaos air with a miniature universe in it.”

“A miniature universe?”

“Miniature universe!”

Everyone was dazed, including Luo Feng. The natural wormhole led to a space where there was a miniature universe? Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“We’ve confirmed that the natural wormhole leads to a mysterious space, and it’s in the human-shaped object,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Besides, the great beings from the first universe era are also trying to get into that miniature universe. They have arranged their machine puppets, and some of them are even trying to get in themselves… However, when they touched the membrane of the miniature universe, they were annihilated immediately.”

“Ah!”

“The membrane is that powerful?”

“How is it possible?”

Everyone in the palace of the Boat of Mausoleum was shocked. Luo Feng couldn’t even imagine that. Normally, the membranes of a universe couldn’t attack. Some universe supreme masters would try to use their miniature universes to kill enemies, but it was after the enemies had entered the miniature universe, and they used the power of the origin of the miniature universe to do it. It sounded ridiculous that the membrane itself could kill.

Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

No matter how the powers in Universe Ocean tried, they all died without exception. This 100 percent death rate intimidated all the powers. Even a slight chance of survival would help, but there was none.

******

Just when giant objects in Universe Ocean were all panicking and feeling helpless, the news was spread that the three ancestral gods were summoning all the powers in Universe Ocean and were going to pass on the message of the original mind.

“What? The three ancestral gods?”

“I thought the ancestral gods from the original universe never left the original universe.”

“A message from the original mind?”

Everyone was surprised. The ancestral gods—who had never set foot in Universe Ocean—arrived and were given the message of the original mind. Both attracted the collective attention of Universe Ocean. Plus, the powers suffered losses when they were inspecting the giant object, so they all gathered around.

******

Boat of Mausoleum also went along.

“A message from the original mind?” Luo Feng frowned. “This is the first time that the three ancestral gods entered Universe Ocean. What do they want?”

Primal Chaos City Leader looked solemn. “They’re here for a good reason.”

When he was trying to kill Great Thunder Star Master, he was able to perform a power that was exactly the opposite of godly power. That was when Luo Feng realized that there was a hidden secret in Universe Ocean that he didn’t know of.

“This giant object is one of them,” said Luo Feng. He also wanted to know what the ancestral gods had to say.

Hong!

Supreme true treasures went along, and Boat of Mausoleum was among one of them. There were three beings in white capes standing in the space around ten million light years away from the giant head. They stood side by side, and their white capes glowed with colorful light. They were incomparably powerful, and their force permeating everywhere.

Palaces floated around the three beings in white capes, followed by lots of great beings.

Luo Feng and the others walked out of the gate of Boat of Mausoleum. They stood in the space and looked at the great beings in white capes in the distance.

Luo Feng sighed. “What a powerful force,” he said.

He felt like the space and time within hundreds of square light years were controlled by the three ancestral gods, and they were much more powerful than any universe supreme master.

Primal Chaos City Leader transmitted his voice. “Remember, they are the representatives of the original mind. Their power is bestowed by the original mind.”

“Let’s see what they’re going to say.” Luo Feng was staring, too.

The humans didn’t have any emotional attachment to the original mind, as Teacher Origin was suppressed by it.

******

As time went by, more and more great beings gathered. The ancestral gods were the ones that gleamed the brightest.

“Three universe eras, two holy lands, and all the powers have arrived,” said the one at the center. “We’ll begin. We enter Universe Ocean because of the order from the original mind, and we’re here for that giant object.”

He then pointed at the giant object.

“When you get in, you will find a natural wormhole,” said Ancient Ancestral God. “If you enter the natural wormhole, you’ll be transported to another place. There’s a miniature universe in the space, and it’s called the ‘World of Jin’! That is the only place in that giant object where you can survive.”
