Chapter 1398: Cast One Net, Catch Them All

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Purple Moon Holy Land had been treating him with such hostility time and again. Previously, they had intervened in the “primal universe internal war,” seeking to uproot and destroy the humans’ foundation once and for all. And now, they wanted to destroy him in the World of Jin.

“Luckily… Luckily I have received a title. If not, I would be caught unprepared. Being able to self-destruct to destroy my other bodies to ensure my survival is already more than what I can ask for.”

Luo Feng was a little intimidated during the aftermath of his situation.

If he did not receive a title, there could be two possible outcomes. One was to be directly killed by Swan Queen, which would be a true death without any second chance for revival.

The other outcome was that with his own willpower, he would have to grasp the few seconds he had to self-destruct before he fell into the illusion! If he could self-destruct, at least he could protect himself from death even if his two other bodies were destroyed. However, the treasures that he had brought along, such as Blood Ghost Blade and Boat of Mausoleum, would be gone—especially the Boat of Mausoleum, since there was a space of inheritance inside.

Of course, only an heir would be able to enter the space of inheritance! The space of inheritance was under the control of his other energy body, so even if it was seized by his opponent, that other party would still be unable to enter. However, while the other party was denied entry, his own earthling original body would also have no chance of entering; only his other energy body could continue to remain within this space of inheritance. And this space of inheritance was lost on the outside.

Harmonious Snow looked toward Luo Feng. “Milky Way, those two commanders, Swan Queen and Fire-Polishing Wu. How do you intend to deal with them?”

“Swan Queen and Fire-Polishing Wu?” Luo Feng frowned. It was clear that he was feeling some anger.

Harmonious Snow responded right away. “The two of them were not aware of your true identity beforehand. They took you to be an ordinary warrior, which was why they were that… Milky Way, would you, slightly—”

“Harmonious Snow,” Luo Feng interrupted him. “You may rest assured that I am not so extreme as to go after their lives. However, for pressing their luck and trying to go over my head, there is no way I can let them off easily. He nodded. “The punishment for them is very simple…”

Luo Feng had gone through the punishment once, but what he said made Harmonious Snow blink in disbelief. It was almost unimaginable for someone like Milky Way, who was a godly king, to come up with such a handling method.

“Do you get it?” Luo Feng asked.

Fire-Polishing Wu and Swan Queen were in a sorry state. They were both bound by ropes composed of condensed airflow, so there was no way they could move whatsoever. Both lay on the ground. On the surface, they were already a sorry sight, but in their hearts, they felt all the more anxious and flustered. The two could see Luo Feng and Harmonious Snow, who were not far away. Even if they could see the two in conversation, they could not hear a single word that was being discussed.

“Swan Queen, you really got me into deep trouble this time around,” said Fire-Polishing Wu, raging and furious.

“I am also in bitter trouble, too,” said Swan Queen, also unable to hold back her emotions. “How would I have known? From what I know, the four generals were the highest and most powerful of our World of Jin. Now, this Lord Milky Way has appeared out of nowhere! Our World of Jin is obviously not like what it appears to be the surface. It is much more mysterious. I just did not expect us to have to be the ones to chance upon this mysterious side.”

Fire-Polishing Wu shook his head in agony.

The Jin Dynasty might have fallen, but out of those formidable great beings who had followed His Majesty the Godly King out to battle back then, there were quite a few who were much stronger than the four great generals. Perhaps this Milky Way was one of the super great beings who had followed His Majesty the Godly King out to war and managed to survive…

“Let’s wait.”

“And pray we are spared.”

Fire-Polishing Wu and Swan Queen lay down, feeling hopeful. At that moment, General Harmonious Snow approached them from afar.

“General.”

“General.”

Both pairs of eyes lit up. They had been under his command for a long time, so they believed they should have a chance of surviving.

General Harmonious Snow walked over. Looking at Fire-Polishing Wu and Swan Queen, who were both lying on the floor, he said without further ado, “The two of you are lucky. Lord Milky Way does not want to take your lives.”

Swan Queen and Fire-Polishing Wu let out sighs of relief. So long as they were spared, how good it would be to stay alive! If this had been a war with other powerful groups, losing their lives would not have been a big deal, but to die in their own territories would be a grievance too great to bear.

“Both of you might be exempt from the death penalty—but certainly not spared the rod.” General Harmonious Snow looked them both in the eyes. “You both have accumulated a tremendous amount of military credits over countless years and have quite a number of treasures in your possession. Now… you shall be stripped of all your military credits and treasures as a form of punishment.”

“Ah!” Both pairs of eyes widened in shock.

Heavens! How could this be? This… This—this was simply…

“Did you not hear me?” General Harmonious Snow frowned as he ordered, “Leave your treasures behind. Why aren’t you both leaving?”

The ropes composed of condensed airflow on Fire-Polishing Wu and Swan Queen automatically broke down and dispersed.

“If you are not going to leave your treasures and depart, does it mean you intend to give your lives instead?” There was a hint of coldness in his eyes as General Harmonious Snow spoke.

How different Milky Way’s status was! He was an heir highly regarded by His Majesty the Godly King. For His Majesty, sacrificing a warrior was not a loss worth lamenting, but the situation would be different for an heir. Two miserable true gods of void space, still hoping to bargain for more than their worth?

“Yes, yes, yes!” Fire-Polishing Wu said, first to respond. “Thank you, Lord Milky Way, for your benevolence. Thank you, General, for your help.”

Hua!

All of a sudden, a pile of treasures appeared beside him. Within an instant, all of Fire-Polishing Wu’s automaton type treasures, soul treasures, armors, weapons, and all other materials appeared before them. He kept none at all. Even the so-called suit of armor on his body, which was, at that moment, merely godly power in its condensed form.

“Mm?” Harmonious Snow looked at Swan Queen.

Although she was most reluctant, Swan Queen was unwilling to die. “I will leave mine, too.”

Within a short moment, Swan Queen and Fire-Polishing Wu had left a pile of treasures. Then, now in a sorry state, they flew off. Their manner as they flew was no longer mighty, as it had been before. Swan Queen no longer left that compulsory streak of flowing, rainbow light she always had while flying; instead, she flew off wordlessly in a most forlorn manner. No other warriors were around to witness such a scene.

“They are gone.” General Harmonious Snow said.

“Mm.” Luo Feng walked over and looked at all the treasures on the ground. He nodded and with a single wave, putting away everything before him.

“As for the military credits that they both accumulated, I will arrange for those to be transferred over to you.” General Harmonious Snow lamented with a sigh. “What a ruthless hand you dealt. For law masters and true gods, they are still able to earn military credits through the missions assigned by the army. But the moment they become true gods of void space, there are no such army missions anymore. If they want to earn military credits, it is incomparably difficult. Yet you took everything that they had painstakingly earned over the countless years away so swiftly and quickly.”

Luo Feng merely smiled. Of course, he knew. This was the reality in the World of Jin. Law masters and true gods were all assigned army missions, but to assign true gods of void space, who were commanders, with missions… For what? Could they possibly be assigned to kill other true gods of void space of the World of Jin?

This was why they were not assigned any army missions—unless there was some foolish true god of void space who dared to provoke the army. Then a few true gods of void space would be deployed to settle the situation. This was when a certain amount of military credits would be given out. But to provoke the army? How many of these true gods of void space would be foolish enough to dare to provoke the army? This was why, generally, the only way for true gods of void space to earn military credits was to command, lead, teach, and guide troops. Commanding itself was a contribution of service. Naturally, every different level of command would bestow these true gods of void space with different amounts of military credits.

However, accumulating military credits in this way was far too slow.

General Harmonious Snow left, too.

Luo Feng headed toward the military point. Just as he entered the hall, the world suddenly changed.

Hua!

A figure accompanied by a beam of golden light appeared before Luo Feng, and most deferentially, he greeted, “My greetings to Lord Milky Way.”

Luo Feng smiled. Every warrior coming in here would have met this figure with golden light. In the past, this figure bathed in golden light was completely hard-hearted, yet now, it was incomparably reverent.

“There isn’t a single warrior around.” Luo Feng looked around. The surroundings were void of everything. Apparently, Luo Feng had been led to an isolated domain.

“Lord Milky Way, this is the ‘ring of the military point.'” The figure bathed in golden light flipped his hand, and in the middle of his palm, an exquisite ring appeared. “Lord Milky Way may make use of this ring of the military point to enter the World of Military Arms anytime you wish. So long as you are within the World of Jin, you may enter the World of Military Arms. There is no need for you to personally come down here to the military point.”

Luo Feng’s eyes lit up.

“The authority of Lord Milky Way begins the moment you receive this ring of the military point.” The ring flew from the figure over to Luo Feng.

With arm outstretched, Luo Feng received the ring. “I would like to look at information on all the warriors who are law masters and those who have joined the four major armies in the recent three eras,” he said. “Also, would you be able to simulate the auras of these warriors?”

“Of course,” said the figure bathed in golden light. “The life form’s aura is indeed the most accurate identification method to determine their identity. Of course, we can do a simulation. Lord Milky Way has enough authority for such a request.”

Suddenly—

Hua! Hua! Hua!

In the empty space beside him, figures started appearing one by one. All these were simulations of the warrior figures who had joined the four major armies over the recent three eras. At first glance, all of them made a mighty sight. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“That’s quite a big number,” Luo Feng muttered to himself. “Luckily, it is only three eras.”

Luo Feng was considered to be from one of the earliest batches. Since he had entered the World of Jin, only slightly more than two eras had passed. Warriors sent by Purple Moon Holy Land could certainly still be found within this time span.

“Let’s begin.”

Luo Feng quickly started checking through. How fast could the speeds of conscious calculation and godly power response of a great being be? Merely a moment had passed. He had very quickly made his selection.

“A total of 96 from Purple Moon Holy Land joined the four major armies,” Luo Feng said quietly.

In fact, Purple Moon Holy Land had sent more than what he had calculated. However, to be accepted into the army, the universe masters needed to first join the selections. No matter how amply prepared Purple Moon Holy Land was, there was no way it could ensure a 100-percent entry rate.

“These 96 of them,” Luo Feng contemplated. “If I want to kill them all… I must do it in one swift move. I cannot afford to take my time. The moment they are alerted, they will escape very quickly.”

“Mm? That’s not right!” Just as Luo Feng was deliberating on how he should kill these 96 universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land, his expression registered a slight change. “If I kill them all this time around, won’t I be alerting Purple Moon Holy Land? Then, when the next era comes, will Purple Moon Holy Land still send universe masters in here?”

Primal universe, primal secret region, in the endless Remote Ocean.

“Teacher.” Amidst the mighty waves, a lone figure appeared. It was none other than Luo Feng.

“Luo Feng,” said Primal Chaos City Leader, looking at him. “You mentioned you have the authority to kill all the universe masters of Purple Moon Holy Land who are within the World of Jin?”

“Uh-huh.” Luo Feng nodded.

The Wu Qi Tower mission. The deal between the Godly King and himself. It was highly unlikely that Luo Feng would tell anyone else about these or several other factors.

“This Purple Moon Holy Land has always pitted itself against us humans,” Luo Feng said in a low voice. “If not for the fact that I am of a different status and authority level within the World of Jin, I’m afraid I would nearly have been played nearly to death by them. This time, I must take my revenge well. Let them, Purple Moon Holy Land, be unable to regain their strength and vitality within the next few reincarnation eras. But I was thinking, the second era has yet to end. Only a part of it has passed, so I’m guessing they will likely send in another big group during the third era. Now that the third era is nearing, when the time is right, I will cast the net and wipe them out once and for all!”

Primal Chaos City Leader’s eyes lit up as he nodded repeatedly. “Great! They used the first era to find out more about the place. The second era, they only sent in a portion of their universe masters. When the third era comes, they will send in another batch. By then, within our Universe Ocean, almost half of every group will be considered as having entered the World of Jin. To make a move, we do indeed have to wait until the third era!

“Also! Not only do we have to make a move against Purple Moon Holy Land, but we also need to make a move against the united forces alliance, which always seem to be fighting the human alliance. We may have the upper hand now, but to truly gain the absolute advantage, who knows how long that will take? Now that you are in the World of Jin, let’s finish off those in the World of Jin with one blow… The power of the demons, the bug soldiers, the automaton race, and several other races will definitely weaken. Eventually, they will no longer have the ability to resist.”

Primal Chaos City Leader’s eyes were sparkling with madness and anticipation.
