Chapter 1386: Thousand Eyes

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

On the sixth level of Wu Qi Tower, Luo Feng appeared and immediately surveyed his surroundings. This was a world of mountains and hills and appeared immeasurably vast.

The aged voice resonated from the sky high above. “You just need to stay alive to pass the sixth level! Then you may enter the seventh level. Warrior Milky Way, you are very close to the peak of Wu Qi Tower…”

Luo Feng smiled. He just needed to stay alive? What a basic requirement! It seemed to him that this would be an extremely difficult level.

Hong!

Somewhere far away from Luo Feng, within the world of mountains and hills, the vast expanse of a particular region suddenly started to tremble as though some massive creature was about to emerge from beneath. The land started to crack, giving rise to uneven bumps, and a great many shattered mountain rocks started crumbling and tumbling off in all directions. Gradually, a dark green shadow began to emerge from underground.

“There really is a beast emerging from underground?” Luo Feng muttered softly under his breath.

The massive green creature emerged from underground with a loud rumble to fully appear on the surface. It had one of the ugliest faces Luo Feng had ever seen, looking a bit like a dark green toad. However, every inch of its skin seemed to contain an eye. At first glance, it seemed to have at least a few hundred eyes.

“Roar!” The beast tilted its head back and let out an angry roar.

Anxiety! Every eye on its body emitted a golden ray of light. The golden rays shot out in all directions, reaching a maximum distance of 100 million kilometers, then dissipating.

Based on the amount of golden light, Luo Feng arrived at an immediate verdict on the number of eyes on this beast. “A thousand eyes.”

The thousand-eyed beast let out a loud howl before looking at Luo Feng. Half of the eyes on his entire body were looking at him. At the same time, its booming voice, which resonated throughout heaven and earth, declared, “It’s been so long. So very long. I… I finally have the chance to emerge once again. Warrior, I will deal with you slowly. Very slowly. The longer you endure… the happier I will be. On this sixth level of Wu Qi Tower, it is difficult. Very difficult to chance upon a single life form.”

Luo Feng laughed. The longer he could endure? His godly body was now as tall as 100 million kilometers. With such a massive godly body, as well as the rampage he had gone on, scouring and collecting treasures on the third level—especially after that plant life form warrior had been annihilated—he had earned himself a pile of automaton type true treasures. The various automaton type true treasures, when put to good use via effective combination, would enable him to unleash extremely strong combat power.

I will survive, thought Luo Feng. If you seek to force me into giving up on survival, it will be extremely difficult.

“Roar!”

Suddenly, the thousand-eyed beast raised its head and gave an earth-shattering, ferocious roar. The surrounding earth broke up into pieces of continents that started floating up. Every continent had a diameter of around 100 million kilometers; at a brief glance, there was at least 1,000 of them. Then these continents rapidly compressed and condensed together, forming numerous black blades. Each blade was around 300,000 kilometers long. A thousand blades were suspended in void space as the thousand-eyed beast gazed at Luo Feng.

“Warrior,” it said. “I hope you have lived long enough!”

Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

A thousand black blades—arranged as if to create a military formation—flew so quickly that they sounded as though they were whistling toward Luo Feng.

“Huh?” Luo Feng frowned.

He was in trouble! The most difficult opponents to deal with were the ones who had control over a large number of spiritual force weapons. If the opponent had merely one such weapon under its control, there wouldn’t be cause for alarm. But controlling 1,000 of these…!

Any single great being, when controlling a spiritual force weapon, would usually go all-out in order to get his spiritual force weapon to unleash its strongest combat power. This was why the common practice was to control one such weapon at any one time. To control ten or even 100 at a time would only serve to weaken the weapons. If that were the case, it would be much better to control one spiritual force weapon at a time instead!

There were some unique circumstances. Luo Feng, for instance, had several other bodies, so naturally, he was able to divide consciousnesses. Every consciousness was fully capable of unleashing an outburst of the strongest combat power.

This thousand-eyed beast had been born with the ability to divide out into 1,000 consciousnesses, and every single consciousness was able to release an outburst of the strongest combat power.

Sou! Sou! Sou!

Thousands of blade shadows, flowing like electricity, instantly enshrouded the sky above Luo Feng, then swooped down quickly, leaving Luo Feng no room for escape. As soon as he managed to ward off the first blade shadow, the other 999 had already moved to surround him. He was entrapped within their blade formation.

Bang!

Luo Feng executed his warm-up method, and with Blood Ghost blade in his hands, it was as though his entire being was a gigantic blade. With a single bang, he established contact with the other blade and very quickly made use of its strength to fly backward. However, upon being thrown backward, the black blade was quick to recover and gave chase. The other black blades around him also charged toward him.

“How troublesome.” Luo Feng gritted his teeth. “Spiritual force weapons and great beings! The difference is that the speed at which these spiritual force weapons move is far faster than great beings! However, to me, this is pointless.”

Luo Feng started executing his body technique without inhibitions.

To him, this form of quantity-based attack was meaningless. If it was a collective attack, Luo Feng might have perhaps been scared and attempted to escape, but this was merely a siege. Tt every one time, there could, at most, be eight to ten blades attacking him; he certainly did not fear such attacks.

“The fifth level, sixth level, and seventh level… Out of these three levels, the sixth level would most probably be the easiest level for this warrior, Milky Way.” Black Mist commander looked at the screen and further commented, “Warrior Milky Way’s body technique is the most astounding thing about him. And the aspect being tested on the sixth level is mainly one’s body technique!”

“Earlier on, a handful already made it past the sixth level,” said the silver-armored female commander. “With body techniques much stronger than any of them, it would naturally be much easier for Warrior Milky Way to pass the sixth level.” She smiled lightly and added, “I am just wondering: To what extent of his skill will this warrior force Thousand Eyes to execute?”

The burly commander by the side also nodded. “Warrior Milky Way is taking things so easily. Thousand Eyes must feel as if his dignity is at stake. He will attack even more aggressively and continuously until he can suppress this Milky Way and deprive him of any possibility of retaliation. Then it will rest its case.”

“I am going to place my bet!” said the evil-looking beast commander seated at the far right. “Thousand Eyes will execute its Thousand Eyes Heart Light in order to defeat Warrior Milky Way.”

It was indeed a breeze for Luo Feng.

Previously, to hone his body techniques within the virtual space in the space of inheritance, Luo Feng had made use of all possible ways, and in the virtual space, he had sparred with generations of super great beings to learn from their skills. Among them, there was certainly a substantial number who controlled spiritual force weapons! Luo Feng had even tried sparring with opponents like the three generations of ancestors… So what could possibly be new to him?

His body techniques included various warfare methods to help him deal with close-range combat, spiritual force weapons, and restraining-type weapons!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A thousand blades surrounded Luo Feng, and everything seemed to become a single, blurry, knife-like shadow. This shadow clashed and crashed against the other blades. Crisp sounds of blades knocking against one another were heard, and most of the time, these sounds were made when Blood Ghost Blade was colliding with another blade surrounding it. Occasionally, Luo Feng’s godly body would receive a blow. Bet no matter what, he tried his best to situate himself in the most advantageous position.

“If we are to go on like this, even one era later, you still can’t do much harm to me.” Luo Feng looked at the far away thousand-eyed beast.

The thousand-eyed beast tried its best to control his weapon. In such a situation, how could it now realize how easy things were for his opponent? It was also shocked. Since the day it had first stepped foot here, Luo Feng was, by far, a warrior with the most powerful body techniques that it had ever encountered. And it seemed like, up till now, it had yet to force this warrior to reach his limit.

The thousand-eyed beast let out an angry roar. “You little warrior!”

Suddenly, the attack method of the 1,000 blades laying siege to Luo Feng all at once changed. Previously, all the blades had surrounded him in order to attack, but it was merely a simple coordinated method of attack.

But at that moment—the moment the blades attacked—it would be ten blades acting together. At one point, 1,000 blades were divided into 100 teams, and every team had ten blades working in perfect harmony. Therefore, their collaboration enabled their power to soar by more than ten times, instantly forcing Luo Feng—who had previously been able to take things easy—into a tight corner.

“Just what kind of a beast is this?” Luo Feng muttered. “One heart for 1,000 blades? And every blade technique is so powerful!”

Luo Feng was going crazy as he tried his best to put up resistance. Not only must he dodge and evade, but he also had to attack at the same time. His body technique was truly at a full-force outburst. This was it!

At times dodging, at times attacking—the perfect combination of attacking and dodging to borrow strength from one another. This was the strongest body technique. At one point in time, it was as though everything within heaven and earth was falling apart.

Hong! Long! Long! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Nine Days Path was a blade technique that was often executed. Once this blade technique was executed, every blade in the surrounding would be immediately ripped apart, bombarded, and then thrown off into the distance. At that time, the entire 1,000-knife formation was thrown into a complete mess.

Hong! Long! Long!

Anywhere Luo Feng traversed would be bombed and torn apart, leaving behind destroyed lands. Furthermore, he was relying on borrowed strength when dodging. Thus, he was completely in control, as well as placed in a totally advantageous position.

“I was wrong.” The evil beast commander watching the scene on screen was shocked as he exclaimed, “Even with Thousand Eyes executing Thousand Eyes Heart Light, it still could not defeat Warrior Milky Way. Earlier on, during the fight, he merely seemed to be dodging the attacks. Who would have expected him to incorporate his blade technique into his body technique? This had allowed his body technique to attain an even higher level of strength.”

Attacking was the best form of defense. One powerful attack could lend strength to a dodge, making it easier by ten to 100 times. Yet, on the other hand, any mistake in attack would bring about a nightmare.

That was why it was extremely difficult to incorporate an attack into a body technique. It required a great deal of experience and someone who was extremely gifted to be able to refine and create such a body technique. Even Luo Feng himself, who had spent more than eight million eras to create this body technique, was extremely proud of it. Judging by the accomplishments of generations of heirs of Duan Dong River… even Luo Feng felt that his ability to comprehend was extremely high.

“Executing Thousand Eyes Heart Light.”

“Thousand Eyes must be going crazy after being cornered into such a desperate situation.”

The four commanders were discussing among themselves.

“As expected, even if Thousand Eyes Heart Light was executed, Thousand Eyes would only gain a slight advantage,” the burly commander said. “There was no way he could defeat that Warrior Milky Way. His body technique… was at the level of law master and had achieved perfection to become absolutely formidable.”

In the world of mountains and hills within the sixth level of Wu Qi Tower.

“Warrior, you are indeed very impressive,” said the thousand-eyed beast. “Even I am unable to defeat you. You are truly one of the most powerful warriors I have ever come across… maybe, you will be able to reach the peak of Wu Qi Tower.”

The dark green, thousand-eyed beast suddenly bore a hole and penetrated deep within the ground with a loud crash. Then he disappeared from Luo Feng’s line of sight. The thousand blades in Luo Feng’s surroundings instantly became countless flowing lights that flew out into the distance. Thereafter, they landed with loud crashes to become mountains and hills.

Luo Feng heaved a sigh of relief.

“Such madness. 1,000 blades all wielded with one heart,” Luo Feng was muttering to himself. “His energy outburst, from the start until the end, is comparable to mine. Yet, at the very end, he could release an outburst at this level.”

Luo Feng was also aware of this. It was that he was weak, but his opponent was strong. His opponent might have just been maintaining this energy. The true identity of this opponent might have been a true god of void space!

At that moment, a streak of light descended from the sky and enshrouded Luo Feng. Instantly, Luo Feng disappeared from the world found on the sixth level of Wu Qi Tower.
