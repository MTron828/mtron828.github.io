Chapter 1362: Greed

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Catch him!”

“Seize him!”

All the strange beast true gods were furious. Even the true gods from Xuan Yu Mountain were shocked. For a law master to be able to kill a true god in such a short time was incredible. Fortunately for them, that law master had seized the true god bodies of Nine Smoke Marsh, so those from Xuan Yu Mountain didn’t need to worry.

Yet Nine Smoke Marsh was very anxious!

“The bodies of the brothers of Nine Smoke Marsh!” roared the strange beast with three golden horns. “More than 30 bodies. We must get them back. We must get them back!”

“Get them back!”

“Get them back!”

The strange beast true gods were yelling. After all, there were only a certain number of true gods in Nine Smoke Marsh, so they all knew each other well; some of the dead bodies might have belonged to very close friends. It was a great being’s destiny to die on the battlefield, but their bodies would still be buried appropriately after they died. However, more than 30 bodies had been seized—and seized by a law master. How could they let it go?

“Ba Ku La, go get that law master and get the bodies of our brothers back!” yelled a strange beast true god with three golden horns.

“I’ll catch him.”

Hong!

Streaks of light flew away, racing after Luo Feng. There were 50 of them in total.

******

Luo Feng kept changing directions in the grass in Nine Smoke Marsh. He slowed down, not wanting to cause any ripples. He was fleeing the true god battlefield, and because he was changing his direction, the 50 true gods didn’t go the right way.

“50 true gods are coming after me, and they are not some mediocre true gods. Most of them have true god level armor.”

Even though Luo Feng was confident, he still didn’t want to be surrounded by all 50 of those true gods. There were, after all, 50 of them. And besides, true gods in the World of Jin were, in general, more powerful than those in Universe Ocean. Godly power wasn’t suppressed in the World of Jin, so that made them two levels more powerful. Even that mediocre, eight-clawed strange beast true god had a technique at level eight, and if he utilized all his power, he might be at level nine. When he had been fighting Luo Feng, he was already injured, so he was only at top-tier level eight. He also didn’t have true god armor to protect him, so he had been killed by Luo Feng’s blades.

“If I get encircled by those 50 true gods, it will be worse than being encircled by f500 true gods in Universe Ocean. Even if I were Boat of Mausoleum, I still couldn’t guarantee that I could get away.”

Luo Feng had to be careful.

Sou!

He changed directions without warning and moved toward the periphery of Nine Smoke Marsh.

******

The fight between Nine Smoke Marsh and Xuan Yu Mountain involved too many great beings. More than 10,000 true gods were involved, and Nine Smoke Marsh had sent 50 true gods to capture Luo Feng. It didn’t affect the overall power of Nine Smoke Marsh.

On the periphery of the battlefield of true gods—

Sou!

The captain was retreating. “50 true gods are trying to capture the new soldier Milky Way. Don’t capture me instead.”

He was on the opposite side as Luo Feng, so he wasn’t in any danger whatsoever. It took him several days to get back to the battlefield of law masters. He decided to pretend to be a tribal warrior and disguised himself in the great army.

“That new soldier Milky Way is too powerful.” The captain was in the army, and he recalled how Luo Feng had killed a true god. “He’s too powerful. I need a machine-type valuable to be able to rival him. More than 30 bodies of true gods. That equates to a great many military credits. He can get a machine-type valuable with those. If I can get another machine-type valuable, I can survive even incarnation-level tasks. Then I can train myself in the military, become a true god, and get a more advanced inheritance.”

His gray eyes glinted with greed. He wanted those bodies!

“How can I get them?” The captain came up with an idea. He immediately sent a message to all the 17 soldiers using his token. “Everyone.”

“Captain.”

“Captain.”

“What do you want, captain?”

“Captain.”

They all responded.

The captain kept sending the message. “Several days ago, the eight-hooved strange beast true god who was responsible for collecting bodies was killed by another true god, and at that moment, that new soldier, Milky Way, suddenly appeared and seized the body! He then got away!”

“What?”

“He got the body of that eight-hooved strange beast true god?”

“That strange beast who collected bodies?”

All the soldiers were shocked.

The captain continued. “Yes. That strange beast true god. The new soldier Milky Way seized the body and the valuables left behind, including the valuable that holds all the bodies of true gods. That strange beast true god had collected more than 30 bodies of true gods before! Now, Milky Way has all of them!”

All the 17 soldiers were all excited. More than 30 bodies of true gods! That would equate to an enormous military credit!

“The true gods from Nine Smoke Marsh are furious, and 50 true gods are now trying to find Milky Way,” the captain continued. “They want to capture him.”

“I just saw it,” one soldier replied. “Lots of strange beast true gods. I was wondering why they would be flying in the sky without fighting.”

“I’ve seen them as well,” said another.

“I saw many strange beast true gods as well.”

“I saw many strange beast true gods yesterday as well.”

The captain said, “Those strange beast true gods are still flying everywhere. Apparently, they haven’t captured him. The entire Nine Smoke Marsh is blocked from the outside by true gods of void space, which means that Milky Way must be within Nine Smoke Marsh, yet those strange beast true gods can’t find him. There’s only one possibility. He’s hiding among the army of Xuan Yu Mountain.”

“That’s right.”

“That’s right, he must be hiding in the army of Xuan Yu Mountain. Xuan Yu Mountain is an enemy of Nine Smoke Marsh. He’s among an army of law masters… The strange beast true gods from Nine Smoke Marsh don’t dare to go the army of law masters.”

True gods were indeed powerful. However, when there were over 10,000 universe masters, even true gods didn’t dare to mess with them.

“Everyone,” said the captain. “Those strange beast true gods can’t enter the army of Xuan Yu Mountain, but we can. We now go and look for him, and once we find him, we’ll tell other soldiers. And we’ll gather and fight that new soldier Milky Way.”

“There’s no guarantee that we can kill that new soldier Milky Way.”

“The new soldier Milky Way is powerful!”

All the soldiers answered.

The captain said, “I know it will be very difficult to kill him, but he’s most afraid of being exposed now! If we can threaten him and force him to give us most of the true god bodies, he can still keep a few of them. If he dares not to give them to us, we’ll tell those strange beast true gods where he is, and he’ll be doomed.”

“That’s right. We can’t get enough military credits by ourselves. We might as well threaten him!”

“He will give it to us.”

“He has so many bodies of true gods, and I only need one.”

“We’ll force him to give us the bodies!”

The eyes of the captain glinted coldly. Everything was going exactly as he expected. He hadn’t even told them that it was the new soldier Milky Way who had killed the strange beast true god. The 17 soldiers under him were all cheerful and weren’t afraid of Luo Feng at all.

That new soldier Luo Feng is indeed powerful, but those soldiers all have true god armors, so it’s not an easy job to kill them, the captain thought. They know I might be using them, but for military credits, they’ll still give it their best shot. No matter what, I’ll have most of the true god bodies.

The captain’s eyes glinted all the more insanely. He had wanted to befriend Luo Feng before, but under the temptation of the military credits, he now opted for another path.

After all, the best thing that could guarantee his survival was power.

******

“I can’t find him.”

“That law master seems to have disappeared. We can’t find him.”

All the strange beasts were scattered around different battlefields, and they were looking for Luo Feng.

“He must have been hiding in the army of Xuan Yu Mountain, among those law masters.”

“He’s got to be.”

All those strange beast true gods all figured that out, yet they didn’t dare to mess around the law master army.

****** Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Both the strange beast soldiers and the captain speculated that Luo Feng was in the army of Xuan Yu Mountain.

And they had it right.

I’ll be found no matter where I hide, thought Luo Feng. However, if I hide here, the strange beast true gods won’t dare to enter even if they know I’m here.

The tribal warriors were all yelling in anger and fighting the strange beasts. Luo Feng was one of the tribal warriors.

There seemed to be no order. However, if a strange beast true god dared to rush into the army, the tribal warriors would attack him immediately. Also, if a tribal true god raced toward the strange beasts, the law master strange beasts would attack that tribal true god at the same time as well.

It was a hidden law! Law masters could fight each other fairly. However, when it came to true gods, they would join forces against the true god.

Lots of tribal warriors gather in Nine Smoke Marsh. Strange beast true gods know that I’m here, but they don’t dare to inspect it. After the war ends, I’ll leave Nine Smoke Marsh immediately.

Luo Feng spent the days here. One month after another passed.

Luo Feng had been in the tribal warrior army from Xuan Yu Mountain for three months. With his power, it was easy for him to survive in the army. Just when Luo Feng was enjoying his time, waiting for the day when he could leave.

“Kill the bastards from Nine Smoke Marsh!” Luo Feng’s body was enormous, and his messy hair made him look like a savage. He was roaring right along with other tribal warriors. But suddenly, he slowed down.

“Huh?” Luo Feng glanced around.

A tribal warrior looked toward him.

The tribal warrior smirked and moved his lips. He didn’t make a sound, but Luo Feng knew what he was saying: “Milky Way.”

It’s a soldier under the captain, Luo Feng realized immediately.
