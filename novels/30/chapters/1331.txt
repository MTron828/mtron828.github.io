Chapter 1332: Luo Feng’s Godly Armor

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng hadn’t expected to get his godly armor in this way, even though Peng Gong Master’s Yan Jun Rod and Huge Axe Creator’s godly axe could both extend and form armor! Luo Feng had owned three pairs of wings before, yet they didn’t extend to form armor, so he hadn’t expected this. Even though Pei Xing Master had black armor and black wings, Luo Feng hadn’t anticipated that the black armor was an extension of the wings.

The five pairs of wings merged with Luo Feng’s body. Under Luo Feng’s godly power, his wings extended, covered his body, and formed a suit of godly armor.

The spirit of Shi Wu transmitted a message in his mind. “Master, this is the subsidiary armor of Shi Wu Wings. It’s a supreme true treasure armor.”

The message amazed Luo Feng. “Supreme true treasure?”

“Shi Wu Wings were a machine type valuable used by a being much stronger than universe supreme masters,” said the spirit of Shi Wu, sounding upset. “Two pairs of wings are only inferior to supreme true treasures, and three pairs can already rival supreme true treasures. As for four pairs, they are already more powerful. The wings you have now are from the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth pair.”

Luo Feng nodded.

He had acquired the first, the second, and the sixth pair before. And he had seized the third and the fourth pair from Pei Xing Master.

“Only adjacent wings can perfectly integrate with each other,” said the spirit of Shi Wu. “There are still some inconsistencies between the sixth pair and the first four pairs… The power can’t multiply well. However, the first four wings are already perfect. They definitely surpass ordinary supreme true treasures, and even the subsidiary armor can rival a supreme true treasure armor.”

Luo Feng rejoiced. He had seen the endless power in the wing space before, and he knew that Shi Wu Wing was extraordinary. With more and more wings being integrated, it was indeed getting stronger.

“Why couldn’t the first two wings form a suit of armor?” asked Luo Feng.

“Master, the wings of Shi Wu Wing have different functions,” replied the spirit of Shi Wu, continuing to send messages. “The first and the second pairs of wings are like the foundation—like the roots of a tree. They are the base. With other wings being integrated, other powers will come. I presume that the third to the fifth pair of wings have subsidiary powers, and the sixth pair is for attack!”

Luo Feng nodded. It made sense. The first and second pairs of wings were like the foundation of a skyscraper—the keel of a ship!

“I see. Attack type supreme true treasures can all extend to form armors!” Luo Feng exclaimed. “Machine type valuables are quite variable and have all sorts of uses! They’re also good at fighting those above their level! How can they not extend to form armor? I only have the armor now because this machine type valuable isn’t complete yet. Shi Wu, what’s the power of this godly armor? Be more specific.”

“Firstly, attacks under level eight can be completely neutralized by godly armors,” said the spirit of Shi Wu. “Attacks over level eight can be weakened to 1/1,000,000th. Besides, the godly armor has a high limit. At least no universe supreme masters can reach the limit.”

Luo Feng was amazed. Attacks under level eight can be completely neutralized? And attacks over level eight could be weakened to 1/1,000,000th? That wasn’t too amazing. After all, even Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor could weaken the power to 1/100,000th.

However, the limit couldn’t even be reached by universe supreme masters. What did it stand for? It meant the weakening power of 1/1,000,000th could be completely utilized! The more powerful an attack was, the less efficient the weakening power of an armor would be. If the enemy was too strong, it might only be able to weaken it to 1/1,000th, 1/100th, or lower, which made him more dangerous.

Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor was impressive at the universe master level. However, when fighting universe supreme masters, its limit would often be exceeded.

“1/1,000,000th? Perfectly utilized?” Luo Feng was shocked. “That means universe supreme masters who have supreme true treasure armors can never be killed by material attacks from other universe supreme masters! Right.”

Luo Feng nodded. It seemed to be true. Those with supreme true treasure armor couldn’t be killed by material attacks. Only some dangerous places in the Lands of Extremis could kill them. Teacher Origin was great at soul attacks at top-tier level ten!

“With that subsidiary armor, I won’t need to fear any material attacks anymore.” Luo Feng was the essence of confidence. “However, I can’t get trapped in a fight for too long.”

Attacks were different from defense. Attacks were aided by techniques and true treasures, and they had no upper limit! As for defense, it depended on the armor! Weapons could help sometimes, but the armor was the most vital part. If someone was too weak to defend himself, he had to resort to armor, as only armor could resist material attacks.

Even if the armor can weaken the power to 1/1,000,000th, my godly body will still be consumed, Luo Feng thought. Universe supreme masters have enormous godly bodies and high-level godly power… I have a small godly body and low-level godly power, and I need to maintain Duan Mie. If I get trapped in a long fight, I’ll be doomed.

Luo Feng understood that he needed to finish a fight quickly.

Compared to real universe supreme masters, one of his weaknesses was that he couldn’t get trapped in a long fight. Also, he couldn’t exceed the speed limit. Of course, he had Star Tower, Blood Shadow Blade, the subsidiary armor of Shi Wu Wings, and Boat of Mausoleum to make up for this.

The five wings were open and floating in front of Luo Feng.

He infused his godly power into the wings and studied Shi Wu Wings. He had found that his Shi Wu Wings were very special. Valuables like Star Tower or Black Prison Tower had many different levels of engravings, but his Shi Wu Wings were exceptional and only had four levels of engravings.

The first pair of wings contained the first level of engravings. The second pair contained the second level of engravings. And the fourth pair contained the fourth level of engravings.

There were only four levels. The first level was called space and time in chaos, and the second level was called Golden Country. The third level…

“The third level is beyond complicated.” Luo Feng frowned. He had already spent more than an era studying the engravings in the space of training. “It’s more complicated than the fifth level of engravings of Star Tower.”

That was how it was. As a machine type valuable, there were few levels of engravings, yet the quality was outstanding. Undying-level Luo Feng could have fully comprehended the first level easily.

As for the second level, he had practiced in Beast God Sector for more than 100,000 years and had reached universe master level on the engraving picture path before he had fully comprehended the second level and practiced Golden Country.

As for the third level, it was too complicated even for him. The gap between each level was exceedingly large.

But Luo Feng wouldn’t give up easily. He could sense that the subsidiary armor was only a side power. The engravings contained on the third wing were truly amazing, which was why he devoted lots of his energy to studying them.

Time passed.

Boat of Mausoleum started to leave Tilted Peak Sector. It spent around 300 years to do so, and 300 years was equivalent to 300 eras in the space of training!

Over the course of 300 eras, Luo Feng spent most of his energy studying the godly power path. As for the rest of his energy, he spent it on the third level of engravings of Shi Wu Wings…

“Too difficult… I can’t understand them. I can’t!”

Boat of Mausoleum flew out of Tilted Peak Sector. Luo Feng shook his head. “I think it’s as complicated as the sixth level of engravings of Star Tower.”

The sixth level of Star Tower was at top-tier level eight! Universe supreme masters like Great Thunder Star Master and Father God of the automaton race could understand the engravings at that level. As for those more powerful, like Huge Axe and First True Master, they could comprehend the engravings at top-tier level nine. Teacher Origin was able to comprehend those at top-tier level ten.

“I’m only a universe master. After I created a blade technique at top-tier level seven, I can comprehend engravings at top-tier level seven or level eight.”

Luo Feng understood that he needed to create superior blade techniques to fully comprehend the engravings at top-tier level eight. He needed a fundamental improvement. Could universe masters create blade techniques at level seven?

None of the great beings in Universe Ocean thought it was possible. However, those great beings also thought that universe masters couldn’t even create blade techniques at top-tier level six, yet the selection criterion for Duan Dong River inheritor was to create a blade technique at top-tier level six as a universe master.

“Based on the records, many talents from the ancient civilization created techniques at top-tier level six as universe masters. All the inheritors of Duan Dong River did that. Creating techniques at top-tier level seven as a universe master was rare in the ancient civilization, yet half the inheritors of Duan Dong River did that. Only two inheritors from Duan Dong River created techniques at level eight as universe masters, including the ancestral teachers.”

Luo Feng had made a decision. After creating Nirvana Incarnation, Luo Feng hadn’t created a better technique. He had much better training conditions after getting the inheritance, and it was likely that he could create a technique at top-tier level seven. He had to train himself as a potential talent like those from the ancient civilization.

“It might take me a long time to become a universe supreme master. I’ll try to improve my power as much as possible. I’ll let them know that after getting the inheritance from Duan Dong River, I can be their better even as a universe master.”

He then decided to temporarily give up comprehending the third level of engravings of Shi Wu Wings and to turn to the godly power path and blade technique creation.

“I can now…” In the chaos air, Luo Feng was driving Boat of Mausoleum and going to Universe Boat to get the valuables left by Jie Fan Zi. “I can totally go look for the last pair of wings. One pair has a very short detection distance. Two pairs of wings can detect through dozens of light years. Three pairs of wings… When I first detected Pei Xing Master, we flew toward each other for around 20 years. The distance must have been thousands of light years, and the summoning was very strong, which means three pairs of wings can detect 10,000 light years.

“That means… For each additional pair of wings, the detection distance must be 1,000 times farther. Four pairs of wings can probably detect tens of millions of light years, and five pairs of wings can probably detect billions of light years.”

Luo Feng was thrilled, as a miniature universe only had a diameter of 100 million light years. The three Lands of Extremis were only 100 million light years. The holy lands were larger but were still only at billions of light years.

“If the last pair of wings is hidden in one of the miniature universes, I’ll be able to sense it if I fly closer to those miniature universes.”

Luo Feng grew even more excited. He only had the last pair of wings left for Shi Wu Wings.

“I’ll go find where the last pair is.”

Luo Feng couldn’t resist the temptation anymore. He immediately drove Boat of Mausoleum and flew toward the nearest miniature universe. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As for valuables left by Jie Fanzi, he would deal with those after getting the sixth pair of wings.
