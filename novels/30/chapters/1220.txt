Chapter 1221: One Was Annihilated

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

All six of them—Deer Bug Master, the three universe masters from Divine Eye clan, Liu Jiu Master and Luo Feng—remained silent, but no one retreated.

You’ve got to be kidding.

Perhaps many things would go through their minds when they just started to make choices, but once they had made their decisions, why should they flinch? From the moment they took their first steps on the path of a great being, death and crises were never far away. Perhaps they might die with much unwillingness, but not a single one would fear death. For the powerful inheritance of this ancient civilization, they would all rather give their best shot to fight for it!

“Good.” Duan Dong River nodded. “Follow me.”

Duan Dong River turned and walked toward another side-door of that foggy hall.

Hua!

The side-door automatically opened. Duan Dong River walked in. Although Deer Bug Master, Luo Feng, Shadow Dust Master, and the other three great beings all had doubts about where they were heading, they still followed his lead.

******

Following behind Duan Dong River, the group walked along a wide path for a short moment before they were completely blocked by a floodgate. Duan Dong River continued walking until he was standing right before the floodgate. Then he stopped.

“Wait a little while. The floodgates will open, and you all will continue along this corridor.” Duan Dong River’s gaze scanned Luo Feng and company. “So long as the six of you are able to walk all the way down this corridor in a straight line and make it to the next hall alive, you will be considered to have passed the most basic level of the selection process and can start to get connected to the inheritance.”

Inheritance!

All six of them, including Luo Feng, Deer Bug Master, and Shadow Dust Master, made a shudder as their eyes lit up.

So long as they could walk all the way down this corridor and make it to the next hall alive? They would be considered to have passed the selection process and start getting connected to the inheritance?

They were all very excited, but all six were also aware that Duan Dong River’s inheritance was very powerful, so the selection process would not be simple… Meaning to say, this corridor would truly be a death corridor. And amongst them, there would likely be someone who would be annihilated. Everyone had to give their utmost best.

“Six of you!”

“As you make your way down this corridor, you can use your weapons, and you can use every technique and method you know,” Duan Dong River instructed slowly. “All you have to do is to make it to the next hall alive.”

Duan Dong River turned to look at the floodgate and pointed to it. “Raise it!”

Hua!

The heavy, large floodgate rose slowly, revealing a wide, deep passageway that seemed to have no end. This made Deer Bug Master, Luo Feng, Liu Jiu Master, and the other three all frown. What dangers awaited them within this death corridor? What methods had Duan Dong River—from a great ancient civilization—deployed for his selection process? Once they failed the selection process, they would have to face the danger of death.

The easiest stage of the selection process was the one before them now. All they had to do was to stand on a magicube instrument for a short while. If they did not pass, they could leave right away.

“You, you, you, you, you! Five of you, go in.” Duan Dong River pointed at five great beings.

“Us?”

“Me?”

“All five of us go in together?”

There was an uproar. All five of them—Deer Bug Master, Liu Jiu Master, Shadow Dust Master, Sorcerer Sprite Master, and Golden Square Master—registered shocked expressions. Duan Dong River had pointed at the five of them and asked them to go in together.

Shadow Dust Master pointed at Luo Feng and could not help asking, “What about him? What about Milky Way Horde Leader, Luo Feng?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Deer Bug Master and the other four started to get a little unsettled. They could not doubt or change Duan Dong River’s decision, but during the screening by the magicube instrument earlier on, they had noticed Duan Dong River revealing a trace of a smile when it was Luo Feng’s turn. At that time, they had found it suspicious.

Furthermore, among them, Luo Feng’s cultivation period was the shortest, at only a dozen eras. Was that not substantially short?

“The five of you will go in together, and he will go in alone,” Duan Dong River said coldly. “Why? Are you unwilling to? Then leave. Now, you are still able to leave this place alive. If you do not leave… The five of you must quickly make your way in. If you don’t enter, you may be disqualified.”

Deer Bug Master, Liu Jiu Master, and the three great universe masters of Divine Eye clan looked at one another, then took one glance at Luo Feng.

“Let’s go.”

“Let’s go.”

Five figures entered the corridor at the same time.

Hua!

The heavy and wide floodgate lowered with a loud crash. The corridor was sealed once again. By the entrance of the floodgate… only Duan Dong River and Luo Feng remained.

Duan Dong River looked at Luo Feng. “Once you enter, there will be no chance for retreat.”

Luo Feng nodded, but many thoughts were rising in his mind. The other five went in together? But he was to enter alone? Why was he so special? Could it be Duan Dong River really looked at him in a different light, or was there a special form of danger awaiting him?

Was this a blessing, or a curse?

******

Within the corridor, Deer Bug Master, Liu Jiu Master and the three great universe masters of Divine Eye clan looked behind them at the floodgate that was once again lowered. Their expressions were slightly different than before.

“The situation does not look promising,” Shadow Dust Master said in a shrill voice. His eyes flashed with a murderous glint. “If an heir was to be chosen, then considering someone like Luo Feng, who has cultivated for only a dozen eras to attain such high achievements to those like us, who have cultivated for close to three reincarnation eras to attain such high achievements, only a fool would not choose Luo Feng. I suspect that the weird magicube instrument test was not only testing our blood lineages and life characteristics; it was most possibly detecting our life spans, too!”

The five of them were shocked. That was right. No one knew what that weird instrument actually screened them for.

“It must have detected some unique characteristics,” Shadow Dust Master laughed coldly. “If not, why would Duan Dong River let out such a rare smile? Apparently, he must be very satisfied with Luo Feng, but why? I think the instrument must have detected that Luo Feng has only lived for a dozen eras and has the shortest period of cultivation. Such an outstanding talent with an extremely short period of cultivation, even to the three reincarnation eras—he is unbelievable. Even if we were to compare him within the ancient civilization, I think he would still be phenomenal. With such an extraordinary talent appearing to inherit his legacy, of course he would be greatly pleased. Thus, the differential treatment!”

“Right.”

“True.”

“That is highly possible.”

One by one, they spoke their minds. Even Deer Bug Master nodded in agreement. They were all of high positions and were clear that when it came to choosing disciples, there would never be absolute fairness. Once they set their eyes on a certain disciple, during any selection process, they would always give differential treatment.

“But what else can we do? Now that the five of us have to go through this corridor together, there is no way we can plant accidents along Luo Feng’s way.” Golden Square Master shook his head. “I think Duan Dong River must have thought about that. That’s why he separated Luo Feng from us. Even if we had any plans in mind, we will not be able to execute them now.”

Deer Bug Master shook his head. “Let’s go. Let’s not think further. This is the inheritance Duan Dong River left behind. We can only act according to his wishes. We can find another opportunity to deal with Luo Feng. Right now, there is simply no chance at all… We can only move forward from here. This death corridor… There is a possibility we might not even be able to make it through.”

“Breaking through the death corridor, everything can be used. Deer Bug Master, with your supreme true treasure, you have a much greater chance.”

“Humph.” Deer Bug Master said no more and flew ahead right away. Liu Jiu Master also transformed into a streak of light and flew ahead.

The other three from the Divine Eye clan looked at one another, nodded slightly, and also continued advancing down the corridor. The only advantage to being part of Divine Eye clan was that the three of them were of one heart! With joined hands, they would not be the least bit bothered even if they had to fight against someone like Deer Bug Master.

******

At the other side of the floodgate, Luo Feng could also vaguely guess that Duan Dong River’s method would have caused the other five universe masters to start targeting him as their enemy and treating him with hostility. They would see him as the greatest threat when it came to the inheritance.

Hong!

A strong wave was faintly transmitted from the other end of the floodgate, and Luo Feng could not resist turning over to take a look. He could only see that heavy floodgate.

Next up, bouts of energy waves were transmitted over in a continuous stream. Apparently, some dangerous life-and-death situation was happening deep within this death corridor.

“Lord Duan Dong River, why would I be separated from the other five?” Luo Feng suddenly asked.

Duan Dong River stood with his eyes closed, his entire being seemed to become an iceberg emitting cold air. Hearing Luo Feng’s question, he opened his eyes and replied, “You only need to follow my instructions. Do not question why I decided on such a selection process. If you are displeased, you may leave. If you choose to leave now, you can still have the chance to live…”

With that, he closed his eyes again.

Luo Feng could only put up with everything that he was asked to do.

******

The Skeleton clan was a pinnacle clan from the first reincarnation era. Within the vast Universe Ocean, there was a total of four miniature universes.

Within the first miniature universe, four towering figures were scattered in four different directions. In midair, they looked at one another. These were the four devil masters from the Skeleton clan.

Red Lark Master stood in midair deferentially as he reported what he knew to the four towering figures. “This was our personal encounter—Jittery Sea’s and mine. That was indeed a terrifying inheritance. An inheritance of a super great being named Duan Dong River*Wu, who was from the ancient civilization. This Duan Dong River*Wu… based on my speculation, must be a great existence that was only second to a so-called general from endless reincarnation eras ago, even before the completion of Universe Boat. His inheritance was definitely something major, and from the descriptions of it, throughout the entire ancient civilization, every generation will only have one heir for this Duan Dong River inheritance.”

“Jittery Sea?” said a towering figure. “Is that true?”

Jittery Sea Master, who was standing to the side, also replied deferentially, “Yes, that is the truth. The two of us were eliminated right from the very first stage of selection. The reason was simply because we do not belong to the same clan, so we do not qualify for the inheritance.”

“Red Lark, whatever the two of you experienced, simulate a part of the memory you have into a projection for us.”

The four devil masters of Skeleton clan were extremely solemn. This matter seemed very serious, even when heard in summary. It was clearly a great deviation from the norm.

“Yes.” Red Lark Master replied deferentially.

A three-dimensional projection appeared in midair. From the moment they charged into the Boat of Mausoleum, the projection started to play. They saw images of Duan Dong River appearing within the hall and saying those words, and they started to get emotional. Then there was the inheritance… one line from Duan Dong River: “Not from my clan, and yet you wish to inherit something from a pulse on my Duan Dong River? Dream on! Get lost!” These words sent chills into the hearts of the four devil masters.

“How loathsome.”

“Such an opportunity, but, because of those three beings from Divine Eye clan, we cannot enter.”

“Loathsome!”

The four devil masters also let out ferocious roars. All were clearly furious.

“Spread this!” A hoarse voice shouted. “Let the news be spread to the three great reincarnation eras and the Two Holy Land Universes. Spread it to them all. Let the whole of Universe Ocean know. Let great beings from all over gather here. We must create chaos, create chaos within the Boat of Mausoleum so that we can destroy Duan Dong River’s inheritance! In short… so long as there is chaos, we Skeleton clan stand a chance. Even if we have no chance, we can destroy it and deprive the Divine Eye clan of their chance. The Divine Eye clan and the Skeleton clan are arch enemies sharing endless hatred for one another. We cannot give them such a great advantage.”

“Spread the news.”

The other three devil masters roared furiously, all in extreme rage. Without hesitation, they started transmitting the news to various groups of powers within the entire Universe Ocean.

Within the deep region of the Universe Boat’s internal region, on Flame Ice Continent, inside the Boat of Mausoleum.

Luo Feng stood at one end of the floodgate, feeling the bouts of energy waves transmitted from the depth of the corridor, yet he was clueless as to what was happening inside.

“Huh?” Duan Dong River suddenly opened his eyes, then whispered, “One annihilated. Four left.”

Luo Feng was shocked. He involuntarily glanced at Duan Dong River.

One annihilated?
