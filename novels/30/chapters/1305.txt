Chapter 1308: Bloodbath! Luo Feng’s Insanity! (Part 3)

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Dream Demon Ancestor, Shock Demon Ancestor, and Father God from the automaton race… Those from the united force were all elevated.

They were all looking forward to the end, and they all thought that it was impossible to kill Luo Feng. After all, as powerful it was as Luo Feng, as long as he didn’t look for his own death, nobody was able to kill him as he had Star Tower and Boat of Mausoleum.

However, Luo Feng seemed to be suicidal now! How could they let such a great chance go?

More than 800 universe masters and more than 10 universe supreme masters! Some of the universe masters even had multiple bodies, so there were around 900 godly bodies of universe masters! And with the universe supreme masters numbering in the teens, all the blurry godly power made an attack at once. It amounted to the combination of 1,000 godly bodies of universe masters. What level of power was it?

Universe masters were ranked from level one to level six. As for universe supreme masters, they could only use the godly power of universe masters with life gene levels of 10,000 times even in Universe Ocean, as they were suppressed by the mind of the original universe. Therefore, ordinary universe supreme masters could only wield power at level seven, and those lucky enough to get supreme true treasures could reach level eight, like Father God from the automaton race!

Huge Axe Creator—before getting the supreme true treasure—had been at level eight! After acquiring the supreme true treasure, he had been able to wield more power with the engravings on the supreme true treasure, at which point he had reached level nine!

At level seven were the mediocre universe supreme masters. Level eight was the ordinary level. Level nine: Both Huge Axe Creator and the first true master from the Divine Eye clan were at this level. Level ten was Teacher Origin’s level!

Teacher Origin had roamed Universe Ocean in the past, and nobody had been his match, which was why he was at level ten! This was the definitive limit of a universe supreme master. In the three universe eras, nobody except Teacher Origin had reached that level.

Although no individuals couldn’t reach this level, numbers could help. And at this moment, more than 800 universe masters and more than 10 universe supreme masters were making attacks at once, which was as powerful as 1,000 godly bodies of universe masters. How terrific that was!

An average universe master was at level four. More than ten universe masters could reach top-tier level six. The combination of 100 universe masters could reach level eight! And the combination of 1,000 universe masters exceeded level nine, nearly reaching level ten!

“The combination of 1,000 godly bodies of universe masters should reach level ten. Luo Feng, you’ll die trying to resist it all by yourself.”

“You’re dead.”

“Even the most powerful universe supreme masters in Universe Ocean can only wield power at level nine. Now, almost 80 percent of the top-tier power in the original universe has been combined… 80 percent of a universe era, and it reached level ten already. Even if you have a supreme true treasure to guard your soul, your godly power is inferior to a universe supreme master. You’re dead!”

“Die!”

“Die, Luo Feng!”

“Die.”

The united forces alliance looked forward to seeing Luo Feng die. All 17 true treasure palaces made attacks at the same time.

“Blurry Godly power!”

“Attack!”

The leaders in the palaces gave orders one by one.

The old beast god, Space Beast Ancestor from the Space Beast Alliance, sighed. He was at least an acquittance to Luo Feng. However, the current situation had to do with his fundamental interests. As for Sitting Mountain Guest? He couldn’t change anything, as it was an action taken by the entire alliance.

Space Beast Ancestor gave the order. “Attack.”

The universe masters under him started to make attacks, including Golden Horn Master.

******

It was silent.

All the universe masters from the human team were watching closely. Many were even staring at Luo Feng. They wanted to see how Luo Feng would come to an end! The peerless genius from the human race… Would he become stronger in the future and reach the level of Teacher Origin or even transcend incarnations?

Or would he die?

The universe masters present—even the three ancestral gods with the mind of the original universe—couldn’t guarantee that they could resist the soul attacks from more than 800 universe masters and 10 universe supreme masters! Like Primal Chaos City Leader and Darkness Master, they were certain that they would die if they tried it!

Primal Chaos City Leader stared at Luo Feng. “Luo Feng…” he said.

He had been worried before. However, Luo Feng was confident. Besides, Luo Feng had handled the soul attack from more than 100 universe masters of other races.

But that was only around 100 universe masters. It was way more powerful this time!

Luo Feng was confident that he could resist it. Primal Chaos City Leader didn’t want the humans to be forced back to the original universe, so he agreed to it.

“Luo Feng.”

Darkness Master, Peng Gong Master, Ice Mountain Master, Void Gold Master, and Long Yan Master all gazed at Luo Feng.

The fate of humanity depended on this! Would the humans be forced to leave the original universe? Would the human territory be occupied and all the life forms within it be slaughtered? Or could they still prosper in the original universe? This was the moment!

******

“Attack!”

“Attack!”

“Kill Luo Feng!”

“Die, Luo Feng.”

All 17 true treasure palaces performed blurry godly power attacks. The ocean water was everywhere, covering all the palace true treasures, so the great beings only needed to attack the water! When the universe masters and universe supreme masters attacked Remote Ocean, they were effectively attacking the soul!

Hong!

The attack was silent, but blurry godly power at this level was too strong, so even the space around the godly power was turned into particles. As for those from the human team staying in Star Tower, they all felt the space tremble.

“Luo Feng!”

“Luo Feng!”

They all looked to Luo Feng.

Primal Chaos City Leader’s eyes turned red, and his godly body trembled. He was worried about the fate of humans and Luo Feng. Was Luo Feng still alive?

Luo Feng, clad in silver wings and silver boots, had his four wings open. He stood still, as if frozen in place.

“Luo Feng? Luo Feng…?”

The human universe masters all stared at Luo Feng, holding their collective breath.

All of a sudden, Luo Feng—standing still as a sculpture—turned his head and smiled at Primal Chaos City Leader, Darkness Master, Long Yan Master, and the other universe masters… He smirked. He showed his white teeth, and he had a bright smile.

The brightness of his smile inspired the human universe masters. They all felt that the future looked more promising.

“Luo Feng!”

“Luo Feng. Hahaha…!”

The human universe masters rushed forward. They were all excited, and some of them even had tears in their eyes. They were all exhilarated. Even Primal Chaos City Leader had tears in his eyes. Universe masters of other races on the human team were also thrilled. They were not as elated as the humans, but they were still amazed by how strong Luo Feng was.

It became cheerful in Star Tower. The human universe masters were all joyous. It was a moment that determined humanity’s fate!

If Luo Feng hadn’t been able to resist it, he would have died, which would have meant humans that the humans would need to retreat back to the primal universe. Then, under the suppression of the powers in the original universe and Universe Ocean, the humans would never be able to prosper. In addition, the ordinary humans in the human territory would have been slaughtered.

But if Luo Feng could resist it, it would be a disaster for the united forces alliance! It meant the united forces couldn’t even touch Luo Feng.

“That Luo Feng resisted it?”

The three ancestral gods and universe masters in Ancestral God Altar were also thrilled. They were all top beings, so they knew precisely what that meant.

That had been an attack from almost 80 percent of the power in the original universe! Yet Luo Feng was able to resist it.

“The united forces alliance is in big trouble!” Double-Face Ancestral God said with a grin. “The humans will definitely win! Let’s see how badly the united forces alliance will lose!”

“We can make attacks now. Their attacks will be blocked by the endless waters. We can defeat them one by one. Haha…”

“We’ll definitely win.”

Ancestral God School chose to stay in the altar before, yet they changed their plan immediately.

******

The united forces alliance was dead silent.

All its universe masters and universe supreme masters were dazed. They had been confident that the blurry godly power could kill any universe masters, even if they had a supreme true treasure to guard their soul. They carefully sensed the water around them as they desperately desired to feel its binding power receding. However, the water was still powerful, suppressing all the true treasure palaces. And the godly power was still burning and forceful, which meant Luo Feng was still alive!

“He’s still alive?” Shock Demon Ancestor, in a true treasure palace, found it hard to believe. “How can Luo Feng still be alive? Even if he has a soul supreme true treasure, his godly power isn’t able to resist an attack at this level. Teacher Origin even killed a universe supreme master before. How did Luo Feng survive? It’s impossible, impossible!”

Bug Empress was also shocked to her very core. “He was unlikely to survive. He should be dead now. Dead.”

She was great at soul attacks, so she knew how powerful that attack was. It was certainly at level ten! Beings in the original universe couldn’t reach level ten, and even in Universe Ocean, only Teacher Origin could reach that level of power. Teacher Origin had been invincible, and he had been great at soul attacks. Even universe supreme masters with their godly bodies needed a soul supreme true treasure to survive Teacher Origin. (Although they could only wield the power of universe masters with a life gene level of 10,000 times, they were immensely strong at defense.

As for universe masters, even one who had a powerful mind and a soul type supreme true treasure would certainly not be able to survive Teacher Origin! An attack at level ten could definitely kill all universe masters!

“How did he survive?”

“How?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Damn it.”

“We’re in big trouble now.”

The united forces alliance was in unprecedented danger.
