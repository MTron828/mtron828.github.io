Chapter 1320: Capture and Wait

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“I, I…” Thunder giant looked around. The 11 universe masters around him tried to stay away. They would have loved to see this thunder giant suffer. These universe masters of other races could tell that Luo Feng was seeking the thunder giant for personal issues!

Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng had been in Universe Boat for a long time, and he’d never made reckless killings before. However, he was suddenly targeting one of the universe masters. Apparently, there were some personal issues between them.

“Thunderstorm star race!” Luo Feng looked down at the thunder giant. “Thunder Shuttle Master!”

“I, I…” Thunder Shuttle Master said, horrified. “Milky Way Horde Leader, I have never seen you before, and there’s no grudge between us. Why are you targeting me?”

He was brave, but he was still terrified by a being who could easily kill him.

“No grudge?” Luo Feng sneered. “Of course, there is. Otherwise, why would I target you?”

The other universe masters were watching them fight. They were barely acquaintances with Thunder Shuttle Master. Besides, they were competitors with each other for the true treasures about to be born. They were happy that Luo Feng was targeting Thunder Shuttle Master. They all knew how powerful Luo Feng was, so none of them dared to meddle. Otherwise, they would bring trouble upon themselves.

“Milky Way Horde Leader, I…” said Thunder Shuttle Master.

“No need to say anything,” said Luo Feng. Then he yelled, “Get in!”

Suddenly, a black hole appeared at the bottom of Star Tower, and it started to swallow the thunder giant.

“No!” Thunder giant yelled and struggled to get out. “I’m from Thunderstorm Star! My ancestor is Great Thunder Star Master! Luo Feng, if you kill me, you’ll make yourself an enemy of Thunderstorm Star and Great Thunder Star Master.”

The space trembled under the roar. Apparently, that thunder giant was hysterical.

“I am making myself his enemy!” said Luo Feng.

Hua!

Although the thunder giant struggled against the swallowing power, he was still flying toward the base of Star Tower. Finally, he was completely sucked in. This turn of events terrified all the 11 universe masters of other races in the area. They were all silent as the powerful Thunder Shuttle Master was sucked into Star Tower.

Everyone was terrified. They knew Luo Feng was powerful, but they were still frightened to witness it with their own eyes.

“That Luo Feng is mad.”

“He has no respect for Great Thunder Star Master, who is one of the most powerful universe supreme masters from the first universe era. Even races like the Divine Eye clan don’t want to be enemies of the Thunderstorm race, which has a small population but great power.”

Luo Feng held Star Tower and landed slowly. The sight horrified all the universe masters. What did he want? He had already captured Thunder Shuttle Master. Why wasn’t he leaving?

Luo Feng stepped on the ground and looked around at the powerful universe masters around him. Most of these universe masters were at level five, and the weakest were at top-tier level four. He said, “I captured Thunder Shuttle Master because of Great Thunder Star Master! You can spread the news and tell everyone that I’ll stay at the center of Whirling Swamp Ocean and wait for him for ten years! If he doesn’t show up within ten years, I’ll kill Thunder Shuttle Master! Did you hear me?” Luo Feng glanced around.

“Don’t worry, Milky Way Horde Leader, we’ll spread the news for sure.”

None of the universe masters dared to disobey him. He was too powerful and had just made himself an enemy of Great Thunder Star Master. Of course, they didn’t want to go against him. It was only spreading the news; they would have done that even Luo Feng hadn’t asked them to.

“Then you can just wait here until the valuables are born. No need to worry about me.” Luo Feng waved his hands, and Star Tower landed on the ground. It immediately became larger and reached 100 million kilometers tall, standing at the center of the huge reef. Luo Feng entered Star Tower and started to wait.

“Thunder Shuttle Master,” Luo Feng said, transmitting his voice. “If your Great Thunder Star Master doesn’t come, don’t blame me for your death.”

Thunder Shuttle Master didn’t say a word.

Luo Feng was under the spotlight of the three universe eras and the two holy lands in Universe Ocean. Everything he did attracted attention. He hadn’t targeted anyone after entering Universe Ocean. However, he had suddenly captured Thunder Shuttle Master from Thunderstorm Star and was now waiting for Great Thunder Star Master! And he had set a deadline of ten years!

“Universe supreme masters can easily break the speed limit, and they can arrive at Whirling Swamp Ocean no matter where they take off from. Luo Feng gave a deadline of ten years—clearly enough time.”

“Why does Luo Feng want to make himself an enemy of Great Thunder Star Master?”

“Who knows?”

Core ground of Tilted Peak Sector, in 10,000 Waves Waters, an area close to the Land of Darkness.

That same day, the news was spread. 10,000 Waves Water was an area in the core ground of Tilted Peak Sector, and it was famous for its illusions. Even with a supreme true treasure palace, it was difficult to get out if one was lost. Of course, it was still much safer than the Land of Darkness. After all, nobody had ever managed to survive the Land of Darkness.

Hong! Long!

An ancient ship floated on the waves. On the ship sat a giant mountain creature, an iron creature, and a thunder giant. They were the three eminent creatures from the first universe era: Dragon Rock Ancestral God, Zhen Jia Emperor, and Great Thunder Star Master.

Dragon Rock Ancestral God sat there, and his voice rumbled. “Great Thunder, that human brat captured a universe master of your race, and he has now spread the news that he’s going to wait for you in Whirling Swamp Ocean for ten years! Ten years is already enough for any supreme masters to get to Whirling Swamp Ocean from anywhere in Universe Ocean. Besides, if you don’t go, you’ll be the laughing stock of all the powers in Universe Ocean.”

“Are you going, Great Thunder?” Zhen Jia Emperor asked, eyes gleaming.

The thunder giant sat there and said, “I am!”

“Great Thunder, if you don’t go, you’ll be a joke,” said Dragon Rock Ancestral God. However, the issue we’re dealing with is of the utmost importance.”

Zhen Jia Emperor added, “That’s right. If another universe supreme master comes, the two of us alone might not be able to deal with it. Last time, when we were fighting Huge Axe, we almost failed.”

“Humph!” Thunder giant snorted. “Only a couple of decades, and chances are, there won’t be any supreme masters. Besides, that Luo Feng is provoking me. How can I not go? He’s only a universe master, and he’s looking down on universe supreme masters just because of his valuables. He’s being suicidal. If I can have this chance to kill him, it’ll help us transcend incarnation.”

“Kill that brat?”

Both Dragon Rock Ancestral God and Zhen Jia Emperor shook their heads. What a joke. Even a large group of universe supreme masters combined couldn’t hurt Luo Feng.

“Great Thunder… Does Luo Feng know that we had something to do with Huge Axe’s death?” Dragon Rock Ancestral God asked. “Is that why Luo Feng is targeting you?”

“Perhaps Huge Axe told the humans before he died,” said Zhen Jia Emperor. “Then it’s natural that Luo Feng’s targeting you. If so, universe masters of my race will be in danger as well.”

“It doesn’t matter whether Huge Axe told the human race before he died or not. How does that impact us?” said Great Thunder Star Master coldly. “They don’t even have a supreme master. What can they do to us? Besides, we’re close to our true death, and we’re from the first universe era. We have to seize this one last chance.”

Zhen Jia Emperor and Dragon Rock Ancestral God both agreed.

“I’m going to deal with that Luo Feng. I’ll come back soon.” Great Thunder Star Master took a true treasure palace and flew away like a streak of light.

Zhen Jia Master and Dragon Rock Ancestral God exchanged a glance, then gave an order to the universe masters of their races.

Zhen Jia Emperor immediately gave an order using the godly power avatar in his small universe, and so did Dragon Rock Ancestral God.

“Those in Universe Boat, leave Universe Boat as soon as possible.”

“If you can’t leave Universe Boat, hide in some secret places in Universe Boat. Try everything to avoid Luo Feng.”

******

Time passed.

Star Tower stood at the center of Whirling Swamp Ocean on the reef, yet there were already 13 universe masters already. Apparently, some pinnacle true treasures would soon be born in Whirling Swamp Ocean. Many great beings knew about this.

Luo Feng didn’t kill beings recklessly, and with the temptation of valuables, two more universe masters had come here. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Purple Moon Holy Land.

“Pei Xing, you’ve already reached level five!” said a universe master from Purple Moon Holy Land with three faces and eight arms. “You can leave the holy land. Congratulations.”

“You can finally go to Universe Ocean,” said a male being with four faces and 16 arms. All his four faces looked exhilarated. “I’ve heard so much about Universe Ocean, yet I couldn’t go before. Fantastic, fantastic.”

Sou!

With great excitement, he started to fly out like a streak of light. He sometimes teleported, sometimes flew at a fast speed. Before long, he had flown out of Purple Moon Holy Land.

“Universe Ocean!” He looked at the endless chaos airflow and looked back at the giant holy land. The four-faced, 16-armed being was exhilarated. “I’ve been in the holy universe for 18 universe eras, and finally, I enter Universe Ocean. This is Universe Ocean! And there are three Lands of Extremis!”

This new universe master, “Pei Xing Master,” was excited.

“During the fight for the Duan Dong River inheritance, Deer Bug Master and the others died, so I had a chance to become a universe master.”

Pei Xing Master was exhilarated. A holy land could only withstand a limited number of universe master, rendering him and the others at the universe-knight level; they couldn’t make a breakthrough.

But during the fight for the Duan Dong River inheritance, Deer Bug Master and a group of other universe masters died. That meant the “universe-masters-to-be” finally had a chance. And based on their power, Purple Moon Ancestor had allowed some of them to become universe masters.

“Finally, I can enter Universe Ocean.” Pei Xing Master opened his black wings, and a suit of black armor covered his body as he gazed out at the endless space. “I, Pei Xing Master, will become something!”

Pei Xing Master was ambitious!
