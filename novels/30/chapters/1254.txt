Chapter 1257: Get Back the White Wing

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was far from Universe Ocean to Tilted Peak Sector. However, when using teleportation and natural wormholes, it took much less time than traveling inside Universe Boat.

Hua!

The water was tumbling in Tilted Peak Sector, and there was a bloody tower floating above the waters.

“It’s Tilted Peak Sector.” Luo Feng, in the body of Golden Horned Beast, was looking down in Star Tower. “It’s only been tens of thousands of years since the last time I came here. Only tens of thousands of years… The white wing hasn’t found a master yet.”

His Shi Wu Wing had already had a spirit! The white wing also had a spirit! If they were combined, only one of the spirits could survive, and with Luo Feng’s affirmation, Shi Wu would definitely be the only one that survived. The spirit of the white wing would be annihilated, which was why the white wing had gone crazy the last time Luo Feng was there.

“It can’t find a new master after countless universe eras, so it would be impossible for it to find a new master in only tens of hundreds of years!” Luo Feng smirked.

Shua!

The bloody tower teleported and dived into the waters. It teleported itself several times in the water. With the supreme true treasure, he went straight toward the cave.

******

Traveling along the dark cave and passing nine light screens, the bloody tower entered the wing space.

Hong! Long! Long!

Blade storms filled the entire space. The bloody tower shrank to the size of a speck of dust, and it approached that gleaming light wing.

After almost a month, it finally reached the area in front of the light wing.

“White wing.” Golden Horned Luo Feng saw the core of the light wing, and the scratches and blood on it.

The bloody tower kept approaching it. Now, the mind attack from the white wing was nothing to Luo Feng.

Weng!

A ripple came from the white wing and was passed to Luo Feng through Star Tower.

“Space Beast!” said an ancient voice.

The Golden Horned Beast pretended to be surprised and said, “Who are you?”

“I am the spirit of the wing true treasure!” said the ancient voice.

The Golden Horned Beast made a surprised voice. “The spirit of the true treasure? Then what’s that mind attack and the blade storm?”

The ancient voice continued, but Luo Feng secretly smirked.

To get the white wing back, Boat of Mausoleum was separated from Star Tower when it arrived at the periphery of Tilted Peak Sector. Boat of Mausoleum was hidden in the chaos airflow around Tilted Peak Sector with the earthling original body and Shi Wu Wing while the Golden Horned Beast came to take the white wing!

Luo Feng knew for certain that once the two valuables were merged, the spirit of the white wing would die. So if the white wing saw Luo Feng coming, it would do everything it could to prevent Luo Feng from taking ownership over it, and it might even kill itself along with Luo Feng. Even though the white wing was only an object instead of a life form, it shouldn’t have terrifying skills.

However, to make sure everything went smoothly, he allowed the Golden Horned Beast to go first!

The white wing only knew that he was human; it didn’t know he had a Golden Horned Beast body.

Humph. After you recognize me as your master, you won’t be able to do anything about it, thought Luo Feng.

******

The Golden Horned Beast pretended to be incomparably excited to find a supreme true treasure, and he was talking with the spirit of the white wing. The spirit of the white wing rushed to recognize the Golden Horned Beast as its master, so he didn’t lie to him the way he had lied to Luo Feng. Instead, it told the Golden Horned Beast the conditions directly.

“I’m more powerful than you think!” said the white wing. “And because of that, the requirements are very high. If you’re a universe knight, you must have the willpower of a universe supreme master! And if you’re a universe master, your willpower must surpass that of a universe supreme master. If you can’t meet the conditions, tell the other great beings in your race to come. I’ve been lonely for too long, and I want to get out.”

The white wing tried everything to persuade the Golden Horned Beast.

Luo Feng sighed.

Wow! It was being so nice! It had been very sneaky when his original body had come in, yet now, it was so passionate.

“Howl! Are you being serious?”

“Of course I am,” said the white wing.

“Howl!” The Golden Horned Beast looked extremely excited. He roared, “It’s great! I arrived here easily and withstood that mind attack because my willpower is at the universe supreme master level. Also, I’m a universe knight, so I meet the conditions!”

******

The spirit of the white wing was exhilarated. The thing it was most afraid of was being retrieved by Luo Feng, as that meant it would die.

The whole process was very smooth under the guidance of the white wing.

“Seal your godly power on the wing, and then I’ll recognize you as my master.”

The white wing was very cooperative. It wanted to leave the wing space more than anything, and it wanted to tell the new master that a human possessed another part of this true treasure. It wanted the new master to use it to kill that human. After that, it would swallow the spirit of Shi Wu Wing.

“I am the true spirit of the wing true treasure. That goddamn thing took so many energies from the origin… It has to die.”

The spirit of the white wing hated Shi Wu’s guts. It was instinct.

******

“Succeeded!” the Golden Horned Beast yelled.

“Master, the wing is also damaged,” said the spirit of the white wing. “It needs to absorb some precious materials to recover or swallow some pinnacle true treasures.”

After the white wing being taken, the blade storms also disappeared, and the wing space became ordinary. Teleportation was possible now.

Shua!

The bloody tower reached the entrance after one teleportation.

The spirit of the white wing was thrilled. “Finally! The legendary Universe Ocean…”

******

The bloody tower left Tilted Peak Sector and entered the deeper area of the chaos airflow. The Boat of Mausoleum, in the size of a walnut, approached it and sucked it in.

The Golden Horned Beast was sitting inside Star Tower.

“I can feel it. The strong attraction. Master, it’s that human. The human who has the component.” The white wing felt the calling. “I used to be a mighty true treasure, but after that bloody war, it was dismantled, and the human got the other components. I can feel the attraction. He’s nearby.”

The Boat of Mausoleum showed up beside Star Tower, and a human walked out. He was wearing a silver wing and silver armor with a stone blade on his back.

“The spirit of the white wing.” Luo Feng looked at the white wing on Golden Horned Beast.

“You…!” The spirit of the white wing immediately understood. It could feel the absolute command—that it had to do anything the human wanted. “Ah! I should’ve let out all my energies! Damn human!”

The spirit of the white wing roared, realizing that it would die soon.

“In case anything happened,” said Luo Feng coldly. “Now, it’s time for you to die.”

Actually, a single thought from Luo Feng could annihilate the spirit of the white wing. However, he preferred for Shi Wu Wing swallow it, as he could learn more.

“Merge!”

Luo Feng used his godly power to control it.

Hua!

The pair of white wings and the four silver wings floated in the sky at the same time and started to integrate. The components connected to one another, and the origin was transferred to the bottom silver wing. After all, the silver wing was complete, so it didn’t need to worry about an energy leak.

The power spread when they were being integrated.

“Such strong power…” Luo Feng held his breath. “This machine type valuable must be better than the machine type valuables used by universe supreme masters.”

Luo Feng saw that the restructuring process was extremely complicated. The power stopped spreading, and the giant six wings were floating.

The bottom four wings were complete. The top two wings had sharp edges, and there were lots of engravings on the edge, making them keener. According to the spirit of Shi Wu, the complete Shi Wu Wing had six pairs. The other five pairs were like blade backs and blade bodies, while the white wing was like the edge.

“Come.”

The six-winged true treasure flew toward Luo Feng and merged onto his back.

Hua!

The six wings shone! Without any godly power, the true treasure slashed the space in the control room easily.

“Even without the origin, it can rival a supreme true treasure!” Luo Feng exclaimed. “If I use my Nirvana Renaissance, it might only be weaker than my Blood Shadow Blade… If I use the origin… Unfortunately, I can’t use the origin yet.”

The origin was like an engine. It was used to store energies.

When great beings used the complete six wings, the godly power should infuse the origin, which would transfer the godly power into something more aggressive—energies in the form of blade storms! The energies could be stored in the origin, and in an actual fight, it could use the storage before using the godly power.

However, the stored energies belonged to the former master instead of Luo Feng. He could infuse his godly power into the origin and transform it into blade storms, but it would be much weaker! When he used the origin, he had to expel the energies from the former master. The two kinds of godly power were at different levels, so they couldn’t be stored in one place.

Once it exploded, it would be used up at one time, but Luo Feng couldn’t utilize even one-tenth of it.

The only way he could use it was to infuse his godly power to expel the energies left by the former master. When the former energies were expelled all at once, it would be extremely powerful, so Luo Feng didn’t dare to use the origin. He only used his godly power to drive Shi Wu Wing, making Shi Wu Wing work like an ordinary supreme true treasure.
