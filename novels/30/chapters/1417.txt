Chapter 1419: The Reluctance to Kill

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Streaks of distorted rays of light entangled with one another as they surrounded Firefly True Master, forming a cocoon around him. The cocoon released a black fog.

“Ah!”

Within the cocoon, Firefly True Master was struggling like mad, causing the cocoon to suddenly balloon up. Then, without warning, another spot bulged out, and the bulging of the cocoon at random spots continued successively while the black fog became all the more pervasive, increasingly spreading outward.

“Save Firefly True Master!” roared an infuriated Nine-Headed Demon Master. At the same time, he was blazing up his godly power rapidly to its limit. Then he transformed into an incomparably dazzling golden light and directly charged at the Sector Beast, Morosa. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Sector Beast Morosa also knew that this Nine-Headed Demon Master was not to be trifled with. He was one of the eight great overlords of Universe Ocean. Once again, it opened its mouth. Soundlessly…

Wa!

The soundless scream was only directed at Nine-Headed Demon Master. Nine-Headed Demon Master was momentarily stunned but recovered fast enough to continue charging toward Morosa. As one of the eight great overlords, his willpower certainly was not his shortcoming. He might not have been Luo Feng’s equivalent, but his willpower had also reached the ultimate limit of a true god of void space. Receiving the impact of the soundless scream, he undoubtedly felt a sharp pain, but he was able to endure its intensity.

“Sector Beast!” Nine-Headed Demon Master’s hands sported sharp, golden claws. The pair of sharp claws was an automaton-type treasure. “Tear!”

Nine-Headed Demon Master roared. Suddenly, the pair of sharp claws acting as his hands expanded and became a pair of sharp claws one million kilometers long. Tearing through the void space and moving along a mysterious trajectory, the sharp claws connected with one another. At that moment, the entire void space seemed to be divided into two sides, one black and the other white. Its sharp claws manipulated these two different sides of void space and descended directly upon where the Sector Beast Morosa was.

“Scram,” said Morosa. Two of the Sector Beast’s palms suddenly surfaced into view, and rapidly, they expanded and grew bigger.

Hong! Long!

The pair of golden claws instantly crashed into those palms. Right away, it grabbed Sector Beast Morosa’s body and suddenly tried to tear it apart!

Hua!

This tearing move was the essence of Nine-Headed Demon Master’s attack. Yet Sector Beast Morosa’s body was like rubber. Even though it was being pulled outward—to a length of ten million kilometers—it was still not torn apart.

The elongated Sector Beast angrily roared, “You are Nine-Headed Demon Master? As expected, you are much stronger than the other fools, but it’s still pointless. You can’t kill me!”

“Save me! Save me!”

From afar, the gigantic cocoon of black fog was emerging into view. The consistent bulging was still very apparent, as Firefly True Master was still struggling like mad from the inside. At the same time, he was relying on a domain-type supreme true treasure for voice transmission.

“All of you, attack that black fog cocoon!” Nine-Headed Demon Master shouted his orders via voice transmission.

“All right!”

“Leave it to us.”

The other seven true gods, upon hearing his orders, immediately attacked the black fog cocoon in a frenzied manner. All at once, the cocoon was bombarded by all sorts of moves. Yet it was tenacious. Every time it was bombarded, the force would only be enough to either cause a temporary dent on the cocoon or cause it to become elongated; there was simply no way it could be torn apart.

Also, the streaks of black light rays from the black fog cocoon were connected to the faraway Sector Beast, Morosa. Morosa was in the midst of maintaining the existence of the cocoon. Thus, the power he had will not be able to

The seven true gods were anxious yet helpless.

“Nine-Headed Demon Master, this black fog silk cocoon can annihilate our godly power like mad, and it is incomparably tenacious. That Sector Beast must be providing it with power, and that power is continuously counteracting against us… There is no way we can tear apart that cocoon.”

“There is no way we can attack it to break it apart from the outside. Maybe it is easier from inside.”

“Break!”

Within the black fog cocoon, Firefly True Master was roaring crazily.

Hong!

The cocoon suddenly expanded. It continued to expand until it was expanded to over ten times its original size, and internally, Firefly True Master was apparently going crazy and hysterical. But there was still no way he could break out of that cocoon.

Firefly True Master anxiously transmitted a voice message. “Everyone, it is swallowing my godly power like crazy. Continuously absorbing, and its energy level is not reducing but, on the contrary, increasing! However, I am doing my best to resist, burning up my godly power to resist it. It needed to use its strength to suppress mine, and we were trying to annihilate one another. Previously, when you were all attacking this black fog cocoon from the outside, I felt that its resistance was obviously weakened… All of you should continue to attack. Attack this black fog cocoon! It has limited tolerance. There is no need to use other ways because the other ways will not produce much effect. So long as we use our godly power and try our best to make it use up its power so that it is unable to replenish its supply of godly power in time, we will be able to cause this black fog cocoon to collapse.”

Everyone outside, including Nine-Headed Demon Master, all felt that his reasoning made sense. Godly power was very important to every true god. With the help of an automaton type treasure, a true god’s godly power could unleash hundreds and thousands of bouts of combat power. If they had directly used their godly power to get their opponent to use up its power, then they would be wasting their godly power. For true gods with smaller bodies, this would be a just cause for hesitation.

“Let’s work on using up its power.” Nine-Headed Demon Master ordered.

“All right.” Blood Orchid Ancestor was the first to receive the orders.

A tremendous amount of flowers and vines extended out to ensnare the cocoon in a frenzied manner as Blood Orchid Ancestor launched her attacks with a great deal of godly power.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

Like a pair of red-hot tongs being dunked in water, the reaction between the godly powers and the black fog cocoon was sudden and volatile. Both sides tried madly to consume one another.

Hong!

Within the black fog cocoon, Firefly True Master was also doing his best to put up a resistance. He transmitted a voice message in a most anxious tone: “Everyone, altogether. Let’s try our best together! So long as we can wear it out, the cocoon will break. I just need a moment to achieve this!”

The other true gods, who were feeling hesitant, looked at one another. Then, with gritted teeth, they released their godly powers together in a mighty manner. Without further ado, they charged toward the black fog cocoon.

Hong!

Internally and externally, the eight great true masters combined their efforts. All their godly powers combined to deal a mighty attack. Suddenly, the numerous streaks of distorted light rays that were scattered and spread all over the place by Sector Beast Morosa all converged to surround the black fog cocoon. At that moment, there was no longer a single light ray penetrating the void space. All of these rays were now surrounding the black fog cocoon, as if in preparation for a full-scale attack.

Peng!

Mere seconds later, the black fog cocoon split open with a loud rumble. Firefly True Master dashed way out, looking like a very sorry sight.

“Hahaha…!” Firefly True Master laughed, pleasantly surprised.

Then his delight turned into fear. His godly power had already been used up by as much as 70 percent. That black fog cocoon was absorbing it at a rate that was much too fast.

Peng! Hong!

In the distance, Sector Beast Morosa and Nine-Headed Demon Master were engaged in heated crossfire. Nine-Headed Demon Master was relying on a pair of golden automaton type huge claws that could place Sector Beast Morosa under complete suppression. However, Morosa was also executing a soundless soul attack, which allowed it to easily evade Nine-Headed Demon Master’s attacks.

“Firefly True Master?” Sector Beast Morosa turned back and looked toward Firefly True Master. With a hideous smile, he said, “I had intended to devour you. Who would have expected you to make a successful escape? In that case, you can meet your doom right away.”

Sector Beast Morosa’s body suddenly shook and vibrated.

Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

The numerous distorted light rays that were scattered all over the place when the black fog cocoon had shattered suddenly lit brightly and transformed into dazzling black rays. These rays were no longer distorted as they gathered to form a black, shining column! This black column of light charged toward Firefly True Master so quickly that he was given no chance of escape.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

To the naked eye, it would have appeared that Firefly True Master’s body was gradually disappearing, part by part.

What incredible annihilation! Two opposing powers at that moment were annihilating one another. It was an eye for an eye; killing 1,000 of the enemy would mean incurring a personal loss of 1,000! Yet the Sector Beast, Morosa, could afford to fight on… Earlier, it had already devoured a large portion of Firefly True Master’s godly power, so devouring more than half of the origin of a miniature universe was hardly worth a mention. However, it could not digest the godly power fast enough to transform it into its own power, which was why it had to temporarily store it. Undoubtedly, it was not afraid of using up its godly power.

“No!” Firefly True Master said, attempting to fly toward its battleship.

Greatly shocked, Blood Orchid Ancestor manipulated her vines as she attempted to block the black column of light. She wanted to help build a stronger resistance.

Nine-Headed Demon Master was greatly taken aback. “Stop!”

The rate of annihilation was simply too fast. The black column of light collided with Firefly True Master, causing his body to disappear part by part. Just as the various other parties were about to intervene, Sector Beast Morosa raised its head and let out another soundless attack. This time, every single true god was affected. The one who suffered the smallest impact was Nine-Headed Demon Master, who happened to be the furthest away from Firefly True Master.

“No, no, no…” Firefly True Master tried his best to fly toward the battleship. So long as he could make his way into the ship, he would be safe.

Suddenly, that black column of light started to move and flow. The instantaneous flowing movement gave form to a black, foggy cocoon. It once again enshrouded Firefly True Master, preventing him from escaping.

“Break open!” said Blood Orchid Ancestor as her crimson vine flowers finally flew over.

Hua!

The cocoon vanished into thin air, and Firefly True Master disappeared with it. What was left behind were some treasures, like weapons and armor, that floated in the void space.

Far off in the distance, Nine-Headed Demon Master and Blood Orchid Ancestor were all shocked. Firefly True Master had been annihilated?

******

Hong! Long! Long!

The entire miniature universe started to vibrate. Cracks formed within space as it began to collapse.

Every living soul that belonged to this miniature universe—from universe masters of the Firefly clan to universe knights, undying fighters, and ordinary living souls—were annihilated in the blink of an eye.

******

In the void space, Sector Beast Morosa felt neither joy nor anger.

“Disappeared? Disappeared? Killing that Firefly True Master, the origin of his miniature universe actually disintegrated and returned back to Universe Ocean? My delicious meal! Oh, my delicious fare! If I had known, I would never have killed that Firefly True Master.”

Regret! Sector Beast Morosa sorely regretted his actions. Devouring the origin of a miniature universe would allow him to absorb a tremendous amount of energy—even more than devouring ten true gods! Yet, by killing Firefly True Master, the origin of Firefly True Master’s miniature universe had collapsed right away to retreat back to Universe Ocean. There was no way he could get hold of it.

“Sector Beast!” Nine-Headed Demon Master and company went crazy with rage as they besieged Sector Beast and started to rain attacks down on him like mad.

“If I kill another true god, won’t I be destroying another miniature universe? That was my meal…!” Sector Beast Morosa was reluctant to kill another true god, so he turned to flee. “I would rather feed on the origin of the miniature universe first, then kill the true god later! Now is not the time to kill them.”

Sector Beast Morosa turned to make its escape.

“You want to escape?”

Nine-Headed Demon Master and the other true gods persisted in attacking it and blocking off all possible routes of escape. This infuriated Sector Beast Morosa. As the surrounding void space had been frozen, there was simply no way it could teleport. By relying on flying alone, would it be able to escape from their clutches at all? Nine-Headed Demon Master and company could follow it wherever it went. There was no escape.

Star Tower was advancing amid the chaotic airflow within void space. Luo Feng, clothed in his white robe, held onto a transmission token.

Nine-Headed Demon Master transmitted the news. “Milky Way, Firefly True Master is dead. However, we are no longer taking any chances. The Sector Beast is trying to escape now, but the surrounding time and space are frozen. It is not possible for it to escape! Milky Way, we can suppress it, but killing it would cost us dearly. Who knows? We might see another one or two true gods annihilated. This is why we did not force it into a corner. We only tried our best to ensure that it could not escape. Also, we tried as hard as we could to stall for more time until you and Nine Remoteness could arrive.”

“Great,” Luo Feng replied. “How did Firefly Master die? Even with all of you around, it actually managed to kill a true god?”

From where Nine-Headed Demon Master was, there was silence. No news at all.

A short moment later, a piece of news arrived: “Milky Way, the Sector Beast! The Sector Beast… has escaped!”
