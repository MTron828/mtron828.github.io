Chapter 1377: Awakening

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The vast world on the second level of Wu Qi Tower was a dark red piece of land filled with hot air that soared sky-high. Even neutron stars from Universe Ocean might have been instantly burned to naught the moment they entered this land.

There were five regions with five miniature worlds.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Five dark red rock giants were being tyrannical beyond reason as they went on a rampage, hitting five warriors and reducing them to a sorry state.

In the distance, Luo Feng and the other four warriors watched in silence. There was worry in the eyes of the other four warriors.

“Rock giants are simply indestructible. We must try our best to buy ourselves time.”

The other four warriors were thinking of solutions to deal with their predicament. They had just undergone a round of fighting on the first level and did not have as much time to rest compared to the first five warriors. They took a short rest off to the side, where they could see in advance the dangers that could be found on the second level. This was also a form of compensation.

About half an hour later, after the previous batch of five warriors struggled through a tough round of fighting…

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Luo Feng and the other four warriors could feel the vibrations in their surrounding time and space. Then they were speedily being transmitted elsewhere.

******

Luo Feng felt the distortion of time and space in his surroundings as though he was being transmitted through a wormhole. When everything within his surroundings had stabilized, he had already entered a miniature world.

“Transportation only gives us such a short period of rest. But it also allows us to know the danger beforehand, which seems like a fair exchange.” Luo Feng looked up toward the sky.

Up in the sky, amidst the layers of dark clouds, a gigantic, ancient diagram of secret engravings appeared. The diagram of secret engravings was beautiful beyond words—so mysterious that it was unfathomable—and it enshrouded the entire miniature world Luo Feng was in.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

The ancient diagram of secret engravings was like a massive battleship with numerous gun barrels pointing downward and pouring out endless rays of light. Every ray was comparable to an attack from a true god! Fortunately, this was merely a test to hone and train skills, which was why those rays were spread over the entire region. If they had all been concentrated on one area, the combined attack of billions of rays would have been overpowering; even an eternal true god would not dare put up any resistance.

From this, it could be seen how extraordinary this Wu Qi Tower, left behind by His Majesty the Godly King, truly was.

“Huh?” Luo Feng looked up into the sky. Blood Ghost Blade, which was a stone blade slung across his back, was instantly unsheathed. “Dang!”

Blood Ghost Blade warded off the attack from a streak of light. Luo Feng retreated six steps back in succession, and six large footsteps were imprinted on the ground where he trod. A short moment later—

“I have blocked off nine streaks of flowing light. All are of different colors but carry the same amount of power.”

In his mind, Luo Feng had come to an accurate assessment. He took a brief look at the ancient diagram of secret engravings, chuckled to himself, and then looked down at the vast land beneath.

“You rock giants… Hurry up and appear soon. Otherwise, I would have to use up a fair bit of my godly power just to deal with this ancient diagram of secret engravings.”

Luo Feng made a mental move of intention. “Golden Claw God!”

Hong!

Luo Feng’s appearance underwent an instant transformation. As an automaton type treasure, Golden Claw God could change color as it pleased, and so Luo Feng was transformed into a black, humanoid monster in an instant. His godly power was blazing up to facilitate the emergence of Golden Claw God, which instantly caused Luo Feng’s speed, defense, resistance, attack, and various aspects to soar by two levels.

Luo Feng was reluctant to execute Extermination. The moment he did so, his godly power would be quickly drained. Coping with a crisis at this level, the amount of power he had under such a circumstance was adequate.

Hong! Long! Long!

The earth trembled, and Luo Feng rose up into the air immediately while looking down. From the depths of the numerous gigantic cracks found on the surface of the ground, a scorching crimson-red liquid was continuously erupting, rising up in surging, flowing tides. The great amount of the liquid was rapidly converging to condense into a huge, liquified monster. Then the crimson-red, liquified form rapidly condensed further. Eventually, a dark red rock giant was formed! The crimson-red liquid continued surging in to keep the rock giant replenished.

“Roar!” The dark red rock giant tilted its head backward and let out a roar, then immediately charged toward Luo Feng.

“Great timing,” said Luo Feng, revealing a hint of a smile.

Thrusting hard with his feet, he left a huge claw print in the burning ground. Golden Claw God Luo Feng also charged toward the dark red rock giant head-on. In terms of volume, Golden Claw God Luo Feng maintained a height of 10,000 kilometers, and he was in the state that allowed him to unleash his greatest potential, while the dark red rock giant was close to 200,000 kilometers tall. Golden Claw God Luo Feng merely reached waist-level of that rock giant.

Hong!

The rock giant let out a deafening roar. Soon after, a huge, rocky fist like a mountain peak came flashing toward Golden Claw God Luo Feng’s face.

Shu!

Luo Feng’s figure transformed as if he meant to dodge the blow. The fist followed Luo Feng’s transformations closely, giving chase to deal its intended strike. This punch felt as though it could envelop everything between heaven and earth, denying Luo Feng any chance of escape.

“This Wu Qi Tower that His Majesty the Godly King built,” said Golden Claw King Luo Feng. “Even any random creature that is formed by condensing energy can possess such a subtle fist technique.”

Golden Claw King Luo Feng sighed inwardly. At the moment, he was like a gigantic blade figure and had changed course three times almost instantaneously. That didn’t seem like much. However, to truly attain the ultimate level of his technique, changing course as many times as possible would mean that he had yet to accomplish that level. Ideally, a one-time change in direction should have caused his opponent’s attack to fall short of the target. That was truly impressive! In Nine Smoke Marsh, Luo Feng had been able to easily evade the attack of a true god. But in the face of this red rock giant, he had to change course three times in succession in order to dodge a single punch.

Hua!

As he was dodging, Golden Claw God Luo Feng’s sharp claws deliberately touched the rock giant’s arm, causing the rock giant’s huge form to sway in an unstable manner. Golden Claw God Luo Feng immediately seized the opportunity to hide beside the rock giant.

Hong!

A substantial amount of endless flowing lights descending from the ancient diagram of secret engravings high in the sky and bombarded the rock giant’s body, but none managed to hit Luo Feng.

“Roar!” The rock giant turned around to attack Luo Feng.

“The moment I am within close range, you can rest assured that I will make full use of you as my shield,” said Golden Claw God Luo Feng.

Golden Claw God Luo Feng was like a ghost. Every move he made seemed to be in a linear manner, yet he changed courses several times at lightning speed, leaving the dark red rock giant befuddled as he ran circles around it! The rock giant bellowed. At times, it would turn around suddenly; at other times, it would mindlessly swing its fists in all directions! There were even times when its fists transformed back into the crimson-red liquid to attempt to enshroud and contain Luo Feng.

In short, it was attempting many approaches. Yet Golden Claw God Luo Feng persisted in pestering the rock giant, circling the surroundings and utilizing it as his shield. Not a single one of the descending flowing lights from high above was able to strike Golden Claw God Luo Feng anymore. He would rather exchange occasional blows with the rock giant than be bombarded even once by those flowing lights.

“From how I see it, the rock giant is no trouble at all. On the contrary, it is a great help. With it around, I can consider myself covered by a huge shield. By using this shield, I can easily hide from the attacks of all those flowing lights.”

Luo Feng was executing that terrifying body technique of his to his heart’s content, dodging when he could and borrowing strength when he should. There was simply no way he could be stopped or blocked.

He would never insist on a fight against the rock giant because he was well aware that a rock giant would speedily recover even if it got hurt in battle. It was an undying life form in every sense. If he were to insist on recklessly fighting it, he would only be speeding up the consumption of his godly power.

Besides, at the moment, he was not executing Extermination. He stuck with dodging as his main strategy. Against those descending lights from high above, he had the rock giant as his shield. And Luo Feng’s godly power was being consumed at an extremely slow rate.

Godly King Valley. Within the silver-gray palace beside Wu Qi Tower, on the third level.

Within the hall, a suspended screen was displaying the scenes of internal battles within the ten major miniature worlds. The current circumstances of all ten warriors were shown very clearly. Within the hall, there were four thrones. The one on the far left was enshrouded by a gigantic cloud of black mist. Suddenly, that throne started to tremble.

From within the black mist, a voice spoke. “Body technique…”

Hua!

The magnified scene of the current miniature world instantly shrank while the scene of another miniature world grew in size to occupy almost 90 percent of the screen. Within the scene of that miniature world, the being that was engaged in battle with a dark red rock giant was none other than Luo Feng!

“This body technique… It’s so—it’s so…”

The black mist commander seemed to be extremely shocked. As one of the four major commanders of Godly King Valley, he had overseen generations of selections of Wu Qi Tower and had seen countless elite warriors. But this was truly the first time it had witnessed something like this—such a terrifying display of a body technique!

This was, however, merely formidable in terms of body techniques; it did not represent all other aspects as being equally formidable. The ability to reach such a level might not imply that this warrior was equally superior in other aspects, but he surely had surpassed many elite warriors.

“Such a warrior! How is it possible that none of the other four generals mentioned a word about him to me at all? He is definitely an important seed. A most important seed that His Majesty the Godly King would need. And yet, the list of names submitted to me did not bear the name of this warrior.”

The black mist commander exclaimed this last sentence in a furious voice. His purpose in staying in Godly King Valley for countless years was to seek the one important, peerless character that His Majesty the Godly King required.

“Warrior Milky Way? Python River Army? Oh… So, he just joined the army. No wonder the four generals did not mention anything about him. He just entered the army, and yet he is here to carry out a mission to receive a title. It appears he has absolute confidence. Milky Way? Milky Way?” Black Mist commander’s voice contained a hint of delight. “You three other fellows! Time to wake up from your deep slumber! Hurry over! Hurry over!”

His rumbling voice penetrated the entire silver-gray palace and reached a great depth underground. There, the other three commanders were deep in slumber. The commanders of Godly King Valley did not have many responsibilities, so the four commanders would usually assign one to preside over the general situation of Godly King Valley and also to overlook all general matters of the entire Godly King Sector. When unique circumstances arose, the other three commanders would be summoned.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

Three extremely powerful auras arose, which caught the handful of true god guards within the Godly King Valley by surprise.

On the third level, within the hall of the silver-gray palace, there were four thrones. The far-left one was enshrouded in black mist. The second throne to the left was occupied by a beautiful lady garbed in a suit of silver armor. Her gaze seemed to be the origin of all light, and under her watchful eye, it would be like bathing under the warmest lights. One could unknowingly fall into a world of light.

Seated beside her was a tall, burly commander with blood-colored armor. This commander wore a helmet sporting nine sharp silver horns that resembled machetes and exuded an overbearing air of arrogance.

Entrenched on the far right was a scaly-armored beast that was black all over. This scaly-armored beast had two faces, and each face only had one eye. At that moment, one of its eyes was open while the eye on the other face was shut. The wide-open eye was entirely black and seemed to absorb everything. It exuded an immeasurably intense, murderous aura.

A voice was heard resounding from the black mist. “Quickly. The three of you, take a look. Look at that warrior controlling the Golden Claw God.”
