Chapter 1164: An Yong Master and Luo Feng

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Two towering beings fought each other in the water area of Tilted Peak Sector. An Yong Master held a golden scepter, sometimes using it as a long staff, sometimes as a hammer. Constantly, he performed a supreme technique. Besides, An Yong Master didn’t defend himself against Firestone Master at all!

“Maniac…! The beings from the first universe era are all maniacs, and An Yong Master is a maniac even compared to those other maniacs.”

“Aaah!” Firestone Master roared.

He tried to stay away to buy some more time. However, in Ice Sand Ocean, he was significantly slower, and he was at an absolute disadvantage, which was why he was caught up to by An Yong Master time and time again.

“Firestone from the human alliance, die and become a sacrifice on the path of my eternity,” said An Yong Master.

He had a gentle voice, but that scepter was piercing the universe space.

Hong! Long! Long!

The golden scepter had an oval head, and the head of the oval was like a gourd.

Si! La!

The scepter avoided the shuttle from Firestone Master, and the head hit the chest of Firestone Master. Without a true treasure weapon to resist it, the power of An Yong Master hit the chest of Firestone Master.

Crash!

The armor trembled, and his chest trembled as well. His godly body cracked, and he bounced away. Just when he bounced away, his shuttle hit An Yong Master as well.

Peng!

There was a deep sound. An Yong Master’s godly body was weakened after getting hit, but it quickly recovered. He only paused for a second before charging again.

Firestone Master was indignant. “Maniac! He is insane! Why did I have to run into him? I would have at least been better off if I’d run into others.”

Actually, he was a pinnacle universe master like Flame Emperor. An Yong had better true treasures and a stronger godly body, so he was one level superior to Firestone Master.

Firestone Master was at pinnacle level while An Yong Master was at the top-tier level, rivaling Ice Mountain Master. Firestone Master’s life should’ve been in danger, as he was only one level inferior. However, An Yong Master was trading his own injuries for his enemy’s injuries and was utilizing his speed and consuming his godly body. Even those at his level would be in trouble, not to mention Firestone Master, who was one level beneath him.

When Luo Feng was fighting Star River Master, Star River’s supreme technique “River in Darkness” had been first resisted by Star Tower, but Luo Feng’s godly body was still consumed. If it weren’t for Star Tower, Luo Feng might have been annihilated with one move.

Injuries for injuries… It wasn’t easy to implement. If Firestone Master had been as powerful as Huge Axe Creator and able to resist the scepter, An Yong Master wouldn’t have been able to implement that move. However, An Yong Master was better at techniques, and he used several supreme techniques interchangeably. Sometimes, he used it as a hammer, sometimes a staff, and sometimes as a bayonet… Each move had terrific power, and Firestone Master wasn’t able to resist most of them.

To trade injuries for injuries, one needed to have enough confidence in his godly body. After all, he was hurting himself while hurting others, if he didn’t have a strong enough godly body, he would die before killing his enemy.

A voice was transmitted through the water area. “Firestone, I don’t dare to venture into Ice Sand Ocean, so I can’t help you. You’re on your own now.”

“Roach Prison Master?”

Firestone Master felt happy first, but then was let down. It was useless. Roach Prison Master was at his level. That Ice Sand Ocean covered an area of several square light years, and it would take him a long time to fly here. Besides, even if he made it, Roach Prison Master wasn’t strong enough.

“Nobody can save you,” said An Yong Master, holding his scepter. “You only have 50 percent of your godly body left, and I can kill you within ten moves.”

“Damn it… You just have your armor and body!” Firestone Master roared.

He ran away when he saw An Yong Master, as he knew how An Yong Master fought. An Yong Master’s armor was a top-tier pinnacle true treasure armor, and it was able to weaken the attack to 1/100,000th.

The godly body of An Yong Master had a life gene level of almost 10,000 times! He had a plant body, and it had a godly body several million kilometers tall. Even if he were trading injuries for injuries, he could implement it smoothly with that huge body constantly supplying power.

“My godly body is also a special life form, and it’s 100,000 kilometers tall. Under my weapon, it might take him a long time to kill me. But he’s trading injuries for injuries; it consumes my godly body hundreds of times faster.”

Firestone Master was still hit no matter how hard he tried.

Hong! Long!

His godly body was being weakened. 42 percent… 37 percent… 31 percent…

An Yong Master smiled. “Die.”

“No! No!” said Firestone Master.

He had tried everything to dodge the attacks or to use his weapon to resist them, but it was no use! An Yong Master used his techniques alternatively, and Firestone Master couldn’t defend himself against them at all.

******

Roach Prison Master was at the shallow water area. He looked at the endless Ice Sand Ocean and sighed.

“Firestone, only Peng Gong Master and Primal Chaos City Leader can get there to save you. Otherwise, nobody can help you now.”

Hong!

A being showed up.

“Roach Prison Master,” said a familiar voice.

Roach Prison Master turned his giant head and he a black-haired human in silver armor.

“Luo Feng?” Roach Prison Master was disappointed. He transmitted his voice: “Luo Feng, Firestone Master is being hunted by An Yong Master, and only Peng Gong Master and Primal Chaos City Leader can save him. We can’t do anything about it. Don’t go in. You’ll be in danger if you enter that Ice Sand Ocean.”

“Perhaps I can’t defeat An Yong Master,” said the black-haired human, “but I’m not afraid of him, either.”

“Huh?” Roach Prison Master was dazed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

And then, a dimming golden light appeared in the water area. At the same time…

Hong! Long! Long!

Golden flames extended and crushed Ice Sand Ocean with the help of Golden Country.

Shi Wu Wings and Fire Sand Cup… A combination of the two!

******

Helpless! Firestone Master felt helpless. He only had 20 percent of his godly body left, so he couldn’t even resist anymore.

An Yong Master smiled and moved forward. “Die!”

But suddenly, An Yong Master grew angry. “Who—?” he roared.

Hong! Long!

Ice Mountain Ocean, which had trapped and slowed down Firestone Master, was dismantled. The water became an ocean of flames. The sight thrilled Firestone Master. Suddenly, he heard a voice.

“Still not going, Firestone Master?”

“This voice…” Firestone Master was dazed.

Wasn’t that Luo Feng?

“Quick! Go!” Luo Feng urged.

Sou!

Firestone Master ran away. He felt unhindered. While in Ice Sand Ocean, he felt like he was trapped in the swamp. However, he didn’t feel any resistance in the golden flames; instead, the flames were boosting him and making him faster.

It was the opposite for An Yong Master. He immediately slowed down.

“Who is it?” An Yong Master roared. “This is the Flame Sand Cup of Yuan Ao Master! And that golden light domain can control the space and time! Who are you?”

He had a stronger godly power than Luo Feng, but he was at a disadvantage. True treasures and techniques had different requirements for godly power.

True treasures and techniques had thresholds and limits. When it came to “Miniature Universe,” becoming undying was the basic requirement, and it would take 10 percent of the godly body. However, when Luo Feng got stronger, he would hit the limit. If Luo Feng became a universe master and improved his godly body 100 times, Miniature Universe wouldn’t take 10 percent of his godly body, because when universe masters performed supreme techniques, it only took them a limited amount of godly power.

Ultimate techniques were also different from supreme techniques. The same rule applied to true treasures. The user needed to be strong enough to drive it.

The more powerful one got, the more powerful true treasures he was able to wield. However, there was a limit to true treasures, which was why ordinary true treasures were abandoned by universe masters. They craved pinnacle true treasures and even supreme true treasures.

Top-tier true treasures, pinnacle true treasures, and supreme true treasures…

“I won’t let you run away if I have a pinnacle domain type true treasure,” said An Yong Master. He was exasperated and rescinded the space seal.

Hua!

Firestone Master was thrilled. He teleported himself to the shallow water.

“I see how it is,” said An Yong Master.

He sensed that Firestone Master was only several light years away… He teleported himself there as well.

******

Luo Feng and Roach Prison Master were both in the water area when Firestone Master showed up.

Firestone Master felt awkward. “Luo…” he said.

Luo Feng’s facial expression changed. “Wait.”

A being appeared near them,—a being with a scepter. There were halos behind his head, and a single-eyed phantom was in the halo. It was An Yong Master!

An Yong Master’s eye glinted with anger. He glared at Luo Feng.

“Human, I’ve never seen you!” An Yong Master said furiously.

Luo Feng glanced at An Yong Master. “Now you do.”

Shua!

Luo Feng and the two universe masters teleported themselves, and they got out of the water area and fled away.

“Human! Silver-armored and black-haired human!” An Yong Master shouted with madness and indignation.
