Chapter 1345: Wu and Jin

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

There were a billion members in the might Dry Wilderness Tribe. They had seen many creatures like Luo Feng who traveled around the world to sharpen themselves. It was so common that he wasn’t even received by the seniors of the tribe. However, he was still warmly welcomed by hundreds of families around the child’s family. Some great beings even came to fight Luo Feng.

“This race is obsessed with fighting,” Luo Feng sighed.

On a towering mountain, the strange giant beast and Rampaging Devil God were fighting each other.

Hong! Hong!

“Moron! Is that all you’ve got?” Rampaging Devil God roared. “Come, come, come!”

“You’ve angered me!” roared the strange, giant beast. “Angered me!”

Rampaging Devil God behaved even more recklessly and didn’t back down. He thought, I learned how to pronounce “anger.”

Great beings had great memories. Nobody had ever spoken that kind of language in Universe Ocean, so Rampaging Devil God couldn’t understand a word of it at the start. He listened to the pronunciation of that strange giant beast, and he could decipher the meaning of the common language of the ancient civilization; he could infer the meaning that corresponded to each word. It was very easy to learn a language that way.

Rampaging Devil God kept provoking the strange giant beast as he attempted to learn the pronunciation of each word. After half an hour of fighting, he had learned the pronunciation of more than 300 words.

“You’re not strong enough. Not strong enough!” Rampaging Devil God yelled.

“Howl!”

The giant strange beast was furious. This outsider had armor to protect his body, so it was difficult to fight him. As for the giant beast, he moved without any burden, and he didn’t have any precious armor from the land he randomly occupied.

“I’m angering you, angering you, angering you!” Rampaging Devil God roared, using the word he had just learned.

The giant strange beast stopped. “Damn, damn you!”

Rampaging Devil God was joyful. He had just learned the pronunciation of the word “damn.” He wasn’t stupid. He had met a true god instantly after entering the World of Jin. Apparently, the indigenous creatures were powerful beyond imagination. It was important to learn the language, and the best way to learn it was to talk to a certain creature!

I’ll keep bullying you to force you to talk. I only seek to wrong you anyway, Rampaging Devil God thought.

“You… Damn you!” The giant strange beast looked up and roared. “Come here! This guy is a handful, and he has armor. Kill him and divide the trophies!”

The voice was transmitted via godly power, and the limit speed in the World of Jin was 10,000 times faster the speed of light in the original universe. After only a few seconds, great beings burst out from different places in the mountains, and they were all ferocious, strange beasts.

Rampaging Devil God looked around. 12 beings appeared in the sky, and all of them were true gods.

“You ask for help!” Rampaging Devil God roared and tried to retreat like a streak of light.

“Seize him.”

“Don’t let him run!”

“He has armor.”

“Capture him!”

The giant, strange beast and the 12 beings flew in all directions and encircled Rampaging Devil God.

There were many members in the Dry Wilderness Tribe. In one area, two beings were fighting like two streaks of light.

Peng!

Luo Feng’s foot bore a gleaming golden light, and it struck the chest of his competitor like a burning star. The giant man rolled over and hit a hill in the distance. Rocks fell from the hill.

“Milky Way!” The rolling man flew over, holding a black stick. He roared, “That was impressive—I couldn’t even resist it. I’ve fought many travelers who came here before, and none of them was as powerful as you.”

Hundreds of children watching the fight in the distance all flew over. The leader of the children cheered. “Uncle Milky Way must have been to lots of tribes!”

“Haha!” Luo Feng strolled the leader of the child who was named “Zhen Mo E.”

Luo Feng had been in the Dry Wilderness Tribe for three days. In that time, he had pretended to be a common traveler obsessed with fighting. He learned more and more about the World of Jin during this conversations and battles with the warriors from the Dry Wilderness Tribe.

First of all, the World of Jin was an enormous world. Luo Feng didn’t know the actual number, but he knew that the World of Jin had a diameter of at least a trillion light years! Although this miniature universe looked small from the outside, it was much bigger inside—much larger than the holy lands. Only the original universe was bigger than World of Jin.

“The World of Jin is indeed incredible.” Luo Feng looked at the little child, Zhen Mo E, beside him and sighed.

There were countless tribes in the World of Jin! They fought each other for territory to survive, and their warriors were extraordinary as well. Besides, all creatures born in the World of Jin would become undying when they matured! They took the energies from the World of Jin from birth, and as time went by, they mastered a law.

Everyone could become undying, and after some training, they could become law knights (universe knights). However, it was very difficult to become law masters (universe masters). Normally, only one out of 100 ordinary warriors (law knights) could become a law master.

As for true treasures, it was rarer. And those more powerful than true treasures were exceptional. However, based on his conversations with the locals, there must have been beings more powerful than true gods, as there was one in Dry Wilderness Tribe. He was the greatest being of the tribe, and he was also their pride and joy. It was their leader, “Dry Wilderness”! Because of the power of this leader, the status of Dry Wilderness Tribe was very stable.

“Incarnation transcendence, incarnation transcendence!” Luo Feng was excited upon hearing the news.

Surpassing true gods meant successfully transcending incarnations! There was a powerful being that surpassed true gods in Dry Wilderness Tribe, which meant there must have been lots of beings like this in the World of Jin. It was right for the powers from Universe Ocean to come to the World of Jin to look for chances of transcending incarnations.

On the sixth day of Luo Feng’s stay in Dry Wilderness Tribe, he was talking to his best friend here, Northern Wind. “Northern Wind,” he said. “I’m leaving.”

“Leaving? Are you continuing traveling?” said Northern Wind.

Northern Wind was a highly gifted warrior, and the entire tribe believed he could become a true god! He was also the most powerful universe master that Luo Feng had fought. Of course, Luo Feng could still suppress him, which was why they admired each other.

“No! I’m joining the military this time.” Luo Feng looked into the distance.

“The military?” Northern Wind’s eyes gleamed.

“Yes.” There was a measure of expectation in Luo Feng’s voice. “I’ve been traveling for a long time, so it’s time for me to join the military. I want to be stronger, so I want to join the military of the king. That’s the best way. That’s where countless great beings of the World of Jin gather.”

After learning lots of information from the tribe, Luo Feng knew that the tribes in the World of Jin also called this world “World of Jin.” Besides, the entire world had a common master, “Majesty of Godly King.”

Luo Feng knew that the World of Jin was only one power that belonged to the great Majesty of Godly King, and it was for honing great beings. Only supreme beings were summoned by Majesty of Godly King, left the World of Jin, and fought for him.

To fight for Majesty of Godly King was the desire of all the indigenous creatures in the World of Jin. However, Majesty of Godly King hadn’t taken supreme beings from the World of Jin for a long time.

Luo Feng was astounded when he learned this information. The entire World of Jin belonged a single king? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Because of the inheritance from Duan Dong River, Luo Feng knew that there were many powers in the ancient civilization. “Wu” was one such power, and the supreme leader of Wu was the so-called “Majesty.” That was the information Luo Feng got from the inheritance.

The previous Duan Dong River was bestowed with the name “Wu,” and it was an incredible honor. In the military of the World of Jin, only those most talented and bravest elites could be bestowed the name “Jin.” And Majesty of Godly King hadn’t summoned warriors from his World of Jin for a long time.

Luo Feng extrapolated that Wu and Jin must be different powers from the ancient civilization. Duan Dong River was from the “Wu” team; the World of Jin was from the “Jin” team.

Majesty of Godly King hadn’t summoned great beings for a long time. The World of Jin was in Universe Ocean now, and it was in the human-shaped object. Luo Feng extrapolated that the great Majesty of Godly King from Jin might have died, and that human figure was Majesty of Godly King!

“That godly body is so powerful that it can crash Universe Boat. The shock waves can annihilate supreme true treasures, and the breath inside his body could annihilate supreme true treasures. That’s a supreme being from the ancient civilization.”

The ancient civilization was mighty. Universe Boat, Duan Dong River, the black-striped stone pillar, Boat of Mausoleum, Shi Wu Wing… He could tell from everything that had been left behind.

But even though the ancient civilization had been powerful, it hadn’t ended well. The beings in the World of Jin were lucky to still be alive. However, they couldn’t leave the World of Jin at all. If they did, they would die instantly.

******

The World of Jin was for cultivating great beings for the military, which was why a portion of warriors at the law master level would be taken away! They would spend a long time in the military, after which they could retire. If they were layabouts, however, they would be hunted by the entire World of Jin.

The military was the most powerful force in the World of Jin. There were lots of pieces of armor in the military. The so-called “supreme true treasures” were only outfits for true gods. There were also lots of inheritances. However, the elimination rates in the military were very high. And if someone was eliminated, he would die! It was so ruthless that fewer than five out of 100 who entered the military survived.

There were many benefits to joining the military; 99 percent of the great beings in the World of Jin, including those stronger than true gods, gathered in the military. The core secrets were shared only there, which was why Luo Feng had to go! He believed that with the inheritance from Duan Dong River, he could earn a place in the military!

“Are you going to the military?” Northern Wind roared. “Wait. There will be a group of warriors from my tribe going, and I’ll join as well… We can go together.”

“Oh?” Luo Feng nodded. “Then let’s join the military together.”
