1,800 years passed, and the membrane of the miniature universe, the “World of Jin,” kept changing from dark blue to light blue. And one day, it turned white. True treasure palaces floating outside the World of Jin started to move.

“It’s turned white.”

“We can enter now.”

“Let’s go.”

More than 200 great beings flew toward the World of Jin and tried to use their weapons to poke the membrane first. Then they realized that although the membrane was still exerting great power, godly bodies of universe masters could easily get through.

After confirming that they could get through, the first true treasure palace flew in. Other true treasure palaces followed, including Luo Feng’s Boat of Mausoleum.

The World of Jin seemed to have a diameter of ten million light years from the outside, and the great beings entered it from different areas so they wouldn’t gather.

******

Hong!

After the silver boat made it through the membrane of the miniature universe, it immediately rushed into the World of Jin.

Luo Feng’s godly power sensed the inexplicable force around him. It was a power so pleasing that his entire soul was as cheerful as a fish returning to a lake from a desert. This amazing sensation mesmerized Luo Feng.

“It feels so good! There’s no restraint at all.” Luo Feng was happily surprised.

******

Rampaging Devil God was exhilarated.

“Hahaha! This World of Jin is awesome! There’s no restraint at all, and I can utilize all my godly power!”

Xiu!

He drove his palace true treasure, diving downward. He landed quickly on an ancient and endless land. There were towering mountains around him. The sky and land were filled with energy, and compared to the chaos air in Universe Ocean, the energies made Rampaging Devil God much more comfortable.

“This is where great beings should live!” Rampaging Devil God was exhilarated. He roared. “Howl!”

Hong!

A streak of light flashed, and it was 1,000 times faster than light speed. A being with three heads—one golden one and two silver ones—appeared in front of Rampaging Devil God. All the heads had giant fangs. The three tails were like barbed, metal whips.

The strange, giant beast looked down at Rampaging Devil God and roared, “F*ck off. This is my land!”

Rampaging Devil God could tell from the force of that strange beast that he was also a universe supreme master.

“A universe supreme master?” Rampaging Devil God was astounded. Although the ancestral gods had mentioned that there were creatures in the World of Jin, he was still surprised to discover that the first creature he met was a universe supreme master.

“F*ck off!” the strange beast roared in anger again, giving another alert.

Rampaging Devil God was even more dazed. He could understand the language, but he had no idea how to speak it! The language used by the strange, giant beast was very special; even if one hadn’t learned it, he could easily understand its meaning. Rampaging Devil God didn’t know how to speak it.

Rampaging Devil God opened his mouth, yet he didn’t know what to say. “I… Ah, you. You—I…”

“Howl!” The strange giant beast was furious. He didn’t attack, as he could tell that Rampaging Devil Master was as powerful as he was, yet this individual—who was gleaming with golden light—ignored him as if he was provoking him!

Hong!

He turned into a streak of light, and three curves of light appeared in the sky left by the three tails of the strange giant beast. They swept toward Rampaging Devil God, who tried to dodge them. Suddenly, three giant gullies showed up on the ground.

Rampaging Devil God grew anxious. He wanted to transmit his voice using his godly power. Under normal circumstances, he could totally transmit his voice to convey what he was thinking. However, his blurry godly power was destroyed by the giant strange beast as soon as it was sent.

The giant strange beast grew more furious. “Soul attack?”

Rampaging Devil God felt helpless. He couldn’t even transmit his voice. “I won’t fight you,” said Rampaging Devil God.

“Howl!” The strange giant beast charged at him.

******

More than 200 great beings from Universe Ocean arrived. They were exhilarated to get into the World of Jin, as it was a wonderful world. Of course, few were as unlucky as Rampaging Devil God, who had met a true god right as soon as he entered.

Hong!

The silver boat landed on a vast plain. Then it disappeared, and Luo Feng, clad in silver armor, showed up. He wore only Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor and he a pinnacle soul true treasure to protect his soul. He was also carrying Blood Shadow Blade. By all appearances, out of all his equipment, only Blood Shadow Blade was special. This was his first time here, so he hadn’t brought his most powerful valuables.

“What a beautiful world.” Luo Feng took a deep breath. A fresh, powerful force infused his body, and it was turned into godly power. “I can transform something into godly power that easily? In the original universe, I can only do that by using the law ocean. I can’t believe I can transform the energies into godly power so easily. It is such a stable world.”

Luo Feng’s godly power trembled. There weren’t even any ripples in the space around him. It was stable beyond Luo Feng’s imagination.

“Beautiful, stable, and majestic…” Luo Feng was amazed. It was a perfect world, and it might actually contain the ultimate secret of Universe Ocean.

Sou! Sou! Sou!

A great being flew forward, stepping on the ground. He was fast and landed in front of Luo Feng immediately. It was a child with two black braids in his hair. He clutched a large piece of meat in his hands as he looked at Luo Feng.

“Outsider,” said the child, “this is the land of Dry Wilderness Tribe. Why are you here? Are you one of the travelers our elders talk about?”

Luo Feng was shocked by the language spoken by the child. The indigenous being in front of him was very mediocre. He was merely an emperor undying. However, the language he was using was that which had been used to document the information in the memory stones of Duan Dong River. Apparently, this was the common tongue of the ancient civilization. With the inheritance from the ancient civilization, Luo Feng had easily learned this language.

Luo Feng nodded and spoke in the common tongue. “That’s right, I am a traveler.”

“Wow! I want to be a traveler as well. However, I need to become a law knight before I can do that.” There was envy in the child’s eyes.

******

In the virtual universe, Luo Feng and Primal Chaos City Leader stood at the top of Thunder Island.

“I’ve entered the World of Jin,” said Luo Feng. “I can confirm that it’s an incredible and extraordinary world… It’s far beyond our imagining, and the language they use is the common tongue of the ancient civilization. I know this language, Teacher. I’ll leave the information about the language in the virtual universe.”

“The indigenous creatures in World of Jin are using the common tongue of the ancient civilization?” Primal Chaos City Leader was startled. “Then the World of Jin might be a remnant left behind by the ancient civilization. No wonder there are secrets about incarnation transcendence in it. The language is indeed important. It is the most important factor in integrating with the indigenous creatures.”

******

The World of Jin.

Luo Feng carried his blade, and under the invitation of the child, he headed toward Dry Wilderness Tribe. During his conversation with the child, he could tell that there were many beings who started to travel around when they became “law universe knights.”

Law knights must be universe knights, thought Luo Feng. Law masters must be universe masters.

“That’s our tribe.” The child was excited.

“He!”

“Fly!”

Two beings standing 100,000 kilometers tall were fighting in the distance. One held a blade, and the other held a spear. They were hitting each other like gods. One was blasted away, rolled, and hit the mountainside in the distance.

A universe master. Luo Feng was thrilled. It seems they both have perfect life gene levels.

Hong!

“Kill!”

Luo Feng carefully tried to sense the area. He saw there were many more great beings fighting in the distance. They were all universe masters.

“The warriors of my tribe are training,” said the child. “There are a billion creatures in my tribe, and they’re all incredible warriors. They became law masters after countless battles.”

A billion creatures? Thoughts flooded Luo Feng’s mind. Incredible. It seems that it’s also difficult to become a universe master in the World of Jin.

He extrapolated as much as possible while he speaking with the child. After all, he knew nothing about the World of Jin.

Sou! Sou!

Luo Feng and the child kept flying closer to the tribe.

“Huh?” Luo Feng spotted three towering beings standing in the sky. They were all exceptionally powerful. They wore black armor and carried hammers and axes. Their forces permeated the area. “True gods! Three true gods!”

Luo Feng was shocked to have found three true gods so soon after entering the World of Jin. How powerful did that make the rest of the World of Jin? It was such an exceptional world, yet according to ancestral gods, the creatures living here would die instantly if they entered Universe Ocean.

It was a powerful world, yet it was under heavy restraint. There was, indeed, a huge secret behind this place. Luo Feng grew more cautious.
