In the human territory in the primal universe, Luo Feng sat cross-legged at an elevated height in the hall. With no walls in his surroundings to block his view, he could look far into the distance within that endless void space at the other magnificent palace buildings.

In preparation for the imminent battle, Luo Feng had been putting in his best as he trained hard and cultivated conscientiously. Yet he may have reached a point where there was a bottleneck that could not be rushed. To break through a critical bottleneck, there were many factors that could bring about sudden enlightenment, be it the changes within the universe or engaging in fights with other great beings midway or even during the process of teleportation. In short, there was a possibility of a breakthrough the moment one managed to gain comprehension.

The mighty Thousand Treasure River spread out to cover a region of a few light years as the voice resonated in Luo Feng’s mind instantaneously. “Luo Feng, make your way to the main hall as quickly as you can!”

“Teacher!” Luo Feng opened his eyes right away. “War is here?”

Without hesitation, Luo Feng rose.

Shua!

With an instant teleportation, he vanished.

******

Within the quiet palaces resided numerous great beings from other races. They were entrenched in a certain area either in the form of mountain ranges or in a form that resembled meatballs that were totally green in color. Numerous pairs of eyes on these godly bodies could cause one’s heart to tremble. These universe masters for the other races were not far from one another, and they were scattered all over the surroundings of Primal Chaos City Leader’s Palace.

They were all waiting. Waiting for the war to arrive! They were aware of the danger of taking part in this war, but the dangers and benefits corresponded with one another! If the human alliance could become the third holy land universe, then by joining the alliance, at least their own races would be allocated a portion of the space for their own legacy. As the high-level universe masters of their race, they would be able to live longer lives.

Furthermore, the humans would give part of the experiences of how to become a universe supreme master from a universe master. They were aware that the humans might not tell them everything, but perhaps they would share a tenth of what they knew. Or possibly as little as one percent, which was better than not knowing anything at all. So long as they knew a small portion, it would be greatly beneficial to them.

“For our race!”

“For our race!”

The various universe masters were all of one mind. When it was time to fight, they had to fight. For this fight, they had charged their way in. There were many advantages to gain, but at the same time, this was a war, so there was also the risk of annihilation.

Shortly after, the mighty Thousand Treasure River spread out again, as Primal Chaos City Leader’s voice resonated by the ears of every single universe master. “Dear universe masters, please make your way to the main hall as quickly as you can.”

“It’s coming.”

“Finally, it’s here.”

“War.”

These universe masters from different races had waited for a long time, and every single one had feelings ranging from excitement to disquiet to insanity. However, they were all prepared! A short moment later, they had all teleported.

******

In the primal universe, within the main hall of Primal Chaos City Leader’s City Leader Palace, numerous figures started appearing out of nowhere. The number of great beings gathered in the hall continued to rise from 60 to 70 to 80 to 90. In a fleeting moment, everyone had arrived within the same hall. Then silence prevailed.

Primal Chaos City Leader stood on the steps of the stairway and looked down. Even up to that very moment, he himself had never sat on that throne before. “Dear all,” he began.

The great beings standing below included humans, some races that belonged to the Hong Alliance, and some races that did not belong to any main group or power. Of course, from the moment they joined the humans’ camp, all scattered races would naturally become a part of the Hong Alliance! Among the large crowd of super beings in that huge hall, the one standing at the forefront was—the silver-winged, armored form of Luo Feng, with his blade slung behind his back! Chubby Peng Gong Master with his big pot belly held on to Yan Jun Rod! And the black-robed Darkness Master exuded a silently, deadly aura!

“The demons, the bug clan, and the automaton race have started making their moves,” Primal Chaos City Leader said solemnly. “And the three races have joined one another this time. Apparently, after we taught them such a harsh lesson by causing them to lose six of their universe masters, not a single one of those three races dared to charge into our human territory alone. They are so scared that, now, they only dare to come forward after joining forces.”

Smiles started to form on the faces of the great beings beneath him right away.

Right! So what if there were three races? They were too scared of the human race all the same and could only make their moves after they joined forces.

“At this moment, they are already gathered. I suppose they will soon take action.” Primal Chaos City Leader looked at the numerous universe masters. “Now, let’s follow our original plan. This war… all the universe masters who are taking part—other than Milky Way Horde Leader, Darkness Master, and Peng Gong Master, who have the autonomous right to take action—will all get into Black Prison Tower.”

Quite a handful of universe masters registered traces of relief. Black Prison Tower was a supreme true treasure. Inside, the level of security was naturally much higher. Of course, during the actual war, they would not be all hiding within the tower; otherwise, who would attack the enemy? They all had to be stationed at the exit points of Black Prison Tower where there were no obstructions. This was the only way they could attack the outside world! However, if they could attack the outside world, that meant the outside world could retaliate along the same route. But since they were at the exit points that were also the entrance points, they could certainly hide into the depth of Black Prison Tower anytime, which was much better than being out in the void space without any shield at all.

“Darkness Master.” Primal Chaos City looked toward his younger brother.

Darkness Master nodded slightly, outstretching his hand. A black pyramid appeared in the middle of his palm.

“Black Prison Tower?” The universe masters from the other races all looked over with shining eyes. This was a supreme true treasure! They, from their own scattered races, would never qualify to possess such a supreme true treasure.

“Go!”

Darkness Master manipulated it with his mind, and instantly, Black Prison Tower flew to the middle of the huge hall and expanded rapidly to become a towering pyramid. Around it, three side doors appeared concurrently. This supreme true treasure had side doors and one main door—just like how the first level of Star Tower had many side doors all around its border, while the bottom part could split open to form a deep abyss that would swallow everything up. Or like the Boat of Mausoleum, where the bottom part of the vessel could split open to form a gigantic entrance. But the Boat of Mausoleum did not have a suction ability, so the smaller cabin doors along its edge were more commonly used.

“Everyone, please enter,” Primal Chaos City Leader said.

Following his command, Long Yang Master, Ice Mountain Master, and Deserted Mirror Master from the human race walked in without hesitation. The other universe masters hesitated briefly and exchanged glances. Then, one by one, they walked in, too. A short moment later, within that huge hall, only a Black Prison tower remained with Primal Chaos City Leader, Luo Feng, Darkness, and Peng Gong.

“Darkness,” Primal Chaos City Leader said solemnly. “In here, there is a total of 21 members who are originally from our Hong Alliance and also, 70 new additions who have decided to join our force. Altogether, a total of 91! All will be under your command. This will be our most important source of power. With 91 of them joining forces, any universe supreme master can be blown away or knocked out of his wits. How the 91 of them should be grouped and how they are going to attack or defend is up to your discretion.”

“Noted.” Darkness Master nodded, and without another word, he stepped into Black Prison Tower.

He was the master of Black Prison Tower, which was why he could control those other races. The moment anyone tried to fool around, Darkness Master could send that member into eternal imprisonment within Black Prison Tower. Even if someone tried to escape, there was no way he could escape from that strong suction force of the supreme true treasure. In this war, Darkness Master’s main task was to manage this group of 91 universe masters.

In fact, the chances of these various races escaping during the critical moment were not high. This was because out of the 92 universe masters who joined the human camp, only 70 of them would be taking part in the war. The other 22 were to remain in the original universe. They were to play the roles of hostages. For example, if a certain race had three universe masters, two would step out onto the battlefield while the other one would stay behind in the original universe. The human race’s excuse for such a strategy would certainly be for the lineage of these other races to have continuity. They had to divide the risk as much as possible! The other races knew the actual reason why the humans were doing so, but they would show no rejection. Actually, the demons, the automaton race, and the bug clan were all doing the same thing.

“Luo Feng, Peng Gong, the rest are up to the two of you.” Primal Chaos City Leader looked toward Luo Feng and Peng Gong Master.

Luo Feng and Peng Gong Master nodded. Then Luo Feng waved, and instantly, a vessel landed within the main hall. It was the Boat of Mausoleum.

“Let’s go,” Luo Feng said.

Together with Peng Gong Master, the pair flew right into the Boat of Mausoleum.

“Set off for the headquarters of our virtual universe and wait there patiently!” Primal Chaos City Leader ordered.

Hong! Hong!

Black Prison Tower and the Boat of Mausoleum teleported and vanished at the same time

******

The headquarters of the virtual universe was originally the gathering ground for domain masters, sector lords, and undying fighters of the virtual universe company, while the primal secret region was more concealed. For these two places, one was openly known, and the other was secretly hidden. One handled various foundational matters, while the other handled higher-level matters like the cultivation of core talents.

The headquarters of the virtual universe and the primal secret region both had the universe passageways that led to the primal universe. It was also a place that the humans had to protect!

Based on speculations, if the enemy wanted to attack, they would likely attack either one of the two—either the headquarters of the virtual universe or the primal secret region. And these two places were now well-equipped with the establishment of a stable god country passageway. If the enemies were to attack the primal secret region, they could retreat right away.

******

A black pyramid and an aged vessel were both floating in the void space above the headquarters of the virtual universe.

“Luo Feng, are you nervous?” Peng Gong Master asked with a smile.

“Of course, I am.” Luo Feng let out a deep breath and looked toward Peng Gong by his side. “This is an alliance of the three other races, and based on the information we have, even though a number of scattered races came over to us, there were also others that went over to the other three races! And they have four supreme masters, w. When we truly fight them, these supreme masters all have an edge over us.”

Because supreme masters originally wielded seventh-tier combat powers or even eighth-tier combat power, under the suppression of the primal universe, the most they could execute was sixth-tier as the top.

This was why they could totally multi-task without issue, like manipulating far-range attacks while engaging in close-range battle, and at the same time, unleashing combat power at the level of sixth-tier as the top! One supreme master was easily capable of taking on two opponents at the same time! During the war with the demons earlier on, this had been made apparent to all.

“And Father God of the automaton race and the Bug Race Empress, when confronting them one-on-one, they are both much more powerful than Shock Demon Ancestor and Dream Demon Ancestor,” Luo Feng whispered. “This is a tough war we are facing.”

“We still have some hope of winning this war,” Peng Gong Master replied.

Luo Feng nodded. Although he still felt that heaviness in his heart. Because Father God of the automaton race and Bug Race Empress were both highly skilled in group battles, and they had strange techniques that were very unpredictable. One could already catch a glance or two from observing the battle between the automaton race and the bugs.

“Luo Feng, Peng Gong, Darkness, these are the coordinates. The united force of the three races has just arrived here via their god country transportation.” Primal Chaos City Leader was quick to inform Luo Feng, Darkness, and Peng Gong through the virtual universe.

“Understood.”

“Noted.”

“Setting off now.”

Luo Feng and the other two stayed very focused, as they could not afford to be distracted.

Shua! Shua!

The black pyramid and aged boat teleported successively one after the other toward the faraway coordinates! The coordinates were extremely close to the headquarters of the virtual universe, but Luo Feng and company only needed to teleport over a distance of around 300 light years to arrive there.

******

In the distance, there were some lonely and quiet desert planets. Beside these desert planets, there was a star level in its final stage where it was still radiating faint and dim red light rays. It was this place within the starlit sky.

A gigantic purple sphere, an aged vessel, and a black oval were all in the void space. They exuded an endless, oppressive force that caused time and space to become contorted. Even the star levels far away started to tremble under this oppression and began to undergo drastic changes.

Hong! Hong!

That aged vessel of the ancient civilization and the black pyramid appeared at the same time.

The united force of the three races! The human camp! All gathered within this space.
