Chapter 1353: Rampaging

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Join forces?” Yu Luo, his body fully covered in green, spoke in a cold voice. His eyes swept through Captain and the 17 other warriors behind. “Dear respected Captain, why would I dare join hands with you? Huh? Back when I was still a new recruit, when I was merely sent for an ordinary mission, I tried so hard to please you, following behind you all the time, and what did I get out of it? You used me as bait… If not for my strong ability for self-preservation and the few treasures my grandfather gave me before I joined the army, I think I would have died during my very first mission. A captain like you? You think I would want to join forces with you?”

Yu Luo and the eight warriors behind him looked at the captain with great sarcasm in their eyes.

Captain replied in a low growl, “Every warrior has different abilities and status, and of course, status varies. Back then, you were only a new recruit and didn’t know much. How can you blame me for it? This time, it is a disaster-level mission. Every time such a disaster-level mission occurs, many warriors are bound to be annihilated. Do you think just the nine of you working together have a chance of succeeding?”

“Don’t worry. We do not need your concern.” Yu Luo shook his head and gave a cold laugh. “The nine of us have been through thick and thin together. Since we are in this together, we have sworn an oath… We feel assured putting our lives in one another’s hands. As for you? Humph! We do not trust you at all—let along to place our lives in your hands.”

“Humph1 You can save your efforts!” A beast warrior behind Yu Luo shouted. “If you rope us in now, then, at the most crucial moment, you are going to make use of us again, I suppose.”

Yu Luo looked toward Luo Feng and Wu He, then said coldly, “The two of you new recruits, the moment you are accepted in here, you are sent on a disaster-level mission. Just your luck. But remember… If Ku Fa is willing to take you in, you are still going to be fine. But this captain? He is going to make use of you and leave you all to your own devices, for sure. And… Captain, to ensure that we are not going to be used by you, we are going to make the first move.”

Finishing his piece, Yu Luo, together with the eight warriors under his command, walked directly toward a faraway contorted wormhole near the Great Evil Hall. This was a wormhole that had been created by a great being and could lead one out of the military camp.

Sou!

Nine figures went into the wormhole and disappeared in an instant.

Captain and his warriors were extremely angry.

“Ku Fa.” Captain looked towards Ku Fa and asked, “What about you?”

“No need.” Ku Fa shook her head and smiled. Her smile was incomparably beautiful. Turning to look at Luo Feng and Wu He, she said, “You two new recruits, this is a disaster-level mission. I am unable to help you. However, the journey is long from here all the way to Nine Smoke Marsh, and it will be fraught with dangers. I have a true god level battleship, so let us set off together. I will bring you all over the Nine Smoke Marsh safely. Once we get there, we will go our separate ways.”

“All right,” Wu He replied right away.

“All right,” Luo Feng also said, nodding.

“Let’s go.”

At Ku Fa’s order, the ten warriors under her command, together with Luo Feng and Wu He, all raced toward the faraway wormhole. Then all of them went through it.

Only Captain and his warriors remained. The other warriors were all of the same mind as they spoke up.

“Captain?”

“Do not be bothered, Captain. Without them, we are still able to complete the mission that the army has assigned.”

That burly Captain looked toward the wormhole and sneered coldly. “Ku Fa and Yu Luo. How long has it been since they joined the army? How many times have they successfully made it through disaster-level missions? Do they think that every disaster-level mission is the same? This time, we are talking about the Nine Smoke Marsh, from what I know, Nine Smoke Marsh recently had a great battle with Xuan Yu Mountain, so security is extremely tight now. If we want to succeed, we must join forces. Forget it. Since they are so confident, we shall see when this mission comes to an end… how many of them are left.”

“Captain, you are someone who has survived a reincarnation-level mission. How can Yu Luo and Ku Fa be compared to you?”

“True. I think they will not even be able to survive through one era.”

These warriors placed great faith in their captain.

It was an indisputable fact that his abilities were the best. He had lived for an immeasurable length of time and even owned an automaton type treasure. He might have been a bit selfish, but when it came to perilous missions, perhaps a few would be annihilated who followed such a captain. But following Ku Fa and Yu Luo—therein lay the possibility of total annihilation of an entire team.

Captain gave the order. “Let’s go!”

“Yes, sir,” everyone responded.

Hong!

The group of warriors left in a flash.

******

Through the space wormhole, the group made it out of the military camp to arrive at a vast area above the mountains and forests. With a wave of her hand, the beautiful Ku Fa shook out a black battleship, which was a palace type supreme true treasure. Then everyone, including Ku Fa, quickly entered this battleship. Luo Feng and Wu He, too, did not hesitate to enter.

“To make it from here to Nine Smoke Marsh,” Ku Fa’s clear and melodious voice could be heard saying, “at our fastest, we will still need twelve days. Everyone, do have some patience and prepare as we make our way there.”

Luo Feng stood inside the cabin, yet he was not worried in the least. If this had been Universe Ocean, it would not have been so easy to enter another great being’s palace true treasure. This was because if another great being was allowed in, the moment that other party harbored ill intentions, he might take the palace true treasure back into his miniature universe and kill the original owner! But in the World of Jin, there was no need for such worry.

In the World of Jin, whether one was an undying, a law knight, a law master—or even stronger beings like true gods and true gods of void spaces—their god countries and miniature universes were all within the core space of the entire World of Jin.

In the core of the World of Jin, there was an incomparably vast space that was regarded as the “space of the origin” of the World of Jin. A large number of god countries and miniature universes existed in this space. But great beings of the World of Jin were unable to enter the space of origin, so of course, there was no way they could enter their own god countries or miniature universes. There was no way they could use their miniature universes to kill enemies!

Not only that, but the World of Jin was also different from the Universe Ocean in many other ways. For instance, in the World of Jin, there was not a single being with another body! All undying fighters, law knights, and law masters only just one godly body!

The ability to divide bodies had been originally bestowed upon living souls by the primal universe. Since the living souls of the World of Jin did not receive such a gift from the primal universe, obviously none of them would have a second body.

This was why, in this supreme true treasure battleship, even if Ku Fa were to suddenly turn hostile, the most she could do was entrap everyone within it. Killing any of them was beyond her means. And when it was time for the next round of the mission (one era later), the army would look around for missing warriors who had yet to return. Upon investigation, those warriors who were found to be dead left there. As for warriors found to be held captive, even Ku Fa might have to face a sentence according to the military laws.

When Luo Feng, Wu He, Ku Fa, and the warriors under her command left the army to head towards Nine Smoke Marsh—in the East Army military camp, at one of the military arms points outside the main hall…

“This is the military arms point?” A beast with a huge golden shell raised his head to look at the gigantic hall.

Another beast by its side, with a winding and serpentine-coiled body, transmitted a voice message. “Rampaging, you have already taken the true god level armor. Why are you still here at our military arms point?”

The beast with a golden shell was none other than Rampaging Devil God.

Back when it had most tragically landed on the World of Jin, it had unfortunately provoked a true god level beast. He had fought it purposefully for quite some time to master the language of the ancient civilization. However, he had been met with a greater mishap thereafter—with a group of true god level beasts hot on his heels. Fortunately, it was most skillful in defense, so it had managed to escape unscathed. Since then, he had been wandering about.

True gods, in the World of Jin, were regarded as great beings, and a true god of void space, though truly a super overlord, would still remain within one’s own territory and not roam about. That was why Rampaging Devil God—who had experienced much throughout his various venture, albeit with great prudence—was able to form relationships with some beasts while roaming in the World of Jin and gradually got to know more about the internal situation.

Very quickly, he understood, that the countless inheritances and treasures of the World of Jin were all within the army! So here he was to join the army!

Though normal law masters could join the army, that was only the baseline requirement to make it into the army. Some who cultivated quickly to become true gods before being accepted into the army would join in later. Of course, the army would welcome them most willingly! With true gods joining the army, the chances of elimination during the selection process was much lower. For every ten true gods, only three would be eliminated. Rampaging Devil God was strong in defense, so naturally, he would be able to pull through the arduous process to be accepted into the army. He was even bestowed with a standard armor.

“Why are you so bothersome!” Rampaging Devil God said. “Wait for me. I will go in for a while.”

Rampaging Devil God charged in right away.

Within the hall, at the military arms point…

Buzz!

Time and space seemed to transform when he entered, and he felt like he had entered another world.

“This feeling is similar to the feeling of the human’s virtual universe,” Rampaging Devil God muttered to himself as he looked at everything before him. It was an extremely prosperous sight before him. There were many warriors, and every single warrior was presented as a golden figure. At that moment, another golden figure flew right over to stand before Rampaging Devil God.

“However, this is more magical than the human’s virtual universe,” Rampaging Devil God said to himself. “The virtual universe only involves the consciousness, but this involves the entire body entering.”

“True god warrior.” The golden figure descended. “Speak of your demands.”

“I want to exchange for military credits with this treasure, then I want to change for another treasure.”

Rampaging Devil God was a little anxious as he held onto his Bloody Sea Devil Armor. This was the supreme true treasure that allowed him to run rampant in Universe Ocean, and it had extremely strong willpower that could exert an impactful influence. But now, he had standard armor, and there was not much difference in the effect of their powers.

Standard armor could render any attack below the seventh-tier powerless. Bloody Sea Devil Armor could render any attack below the eighth-tier powerless. As for the degree of the weakening effect, Bloody Sea Devil Armor had a higher tolerance limit. Yet, to Rampaging Devil God, even the limit of a true god level standard armor had to be, at the very least, an attack at the level of a true god of void space. There was no need for such strong armor in Universe Ocean.

As for whether the attacks would be rendered powerless at the seventh tier or the eighth tier, what true god great being would release an attack lower than the eighth tier?

Buzz!

The two eyes of the golden figure shot streaks of golden rays and scanned Bloody Sea Devil Armor. “This is a true god of void space level armor. It is worth 300,000 military credits! Are you going to trade it with your military credits?”

The moment Rampaging Devil God heard “true god of void space level armor,” his eyes widened. He was instantaneously rooted to the ground.

“Are you going to trade it with your military credits?” the golden figure asked again.

“Trade, trade, trade,” Rampaging Devil God said repeatedly. He was entranced with ecstasy. This was a big win—a big win!

Sou!

The golden figure reached out for Bloody Sea Devil Armor and took it without further ado. Then it said, “You need to trade for a treasure. This is the inventory list. You can choose whatever you want.”

A large screen appeared and floated before Rampaging Devil God. There were many detailed lists appearing on the screen, and under every list, there were many treasures.

******

A short while later, Rampaging Devil God sauntered out into the military arms point in the main hall. His friends walked up to greet him.

“I made a killing this time. In a short moment, I exchanged for a supreme true treasure palace and even managed to get hold of four sets of supreme true treasure attack treasures. I now have a complete set of attack, defense, and escape, as well as all kinds of abilities. Upon returning to Universe Ocean, I can rampage to my heart’s content.”

Rampaging Devil God was extremely satisfied.

“The only pity is,” he continued, “I am not a part of the special army. If I was, I would have been able to exchange for an automaton type treasure.”
