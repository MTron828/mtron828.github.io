Chapter 1302: The Surprise Attack

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon hearing Primal Chaos City Leader’s voice, Luo Feng, Peng Gong Master, Darkness Master, and the others all knew that something was terribly wrong. All their expressions changed drastically.

“Teacher Origin just made a discovery.” Primal Chaos City Leader immediately notified the numerous human universe masters within the hall. “The united force consisting of the demons, the automaton race, and the bug clan is going to make use of god country transportation, all at the same time. Their gathering point should be around the surrounding region of one of the demon’s territories, Blood Tooth Star. Right now, they have all gathered and only need to make use of god country transportation and teleportation. Thereafter, very soon, they will arrive at our primal secret region. This leaves us with little time. We must gather all our universe masters immediately. Everyone must hide in Black Prison Tower. My brother, the task of protecting our universe masters, I will leave it to you.”

“Yes.” Darkness Master nodded.

Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!

Numerous figures started appearing successively within the hall. They were the figures of universe masters from various races that had joined the human camp. Seeing how pressed for time they were, Darkness Master saw no need for words. With a wave, a black pyramid instantly expanded at an alarming rate and stood erected within the hall. At the same time, he shouted out his orders: “Everyone must enter Black Prison Tower right away. We are going to prepare for war.”

“All right.”

“Into Black Prison Tower.”

“Supreme true treasure Black Prison Tower.”

This was the first time some of these universe masters from the various races had laid eyes on Black Prison Tower, especially those who had just joined the human camp. None of them were flustered because they understood that by hiding within a palace true treasure—with their opponent having no treasures of willpower with impactful forces—they would be very safe. The moment they were unable to resist further, they could immediately hide in the safety of the palace true treasure. At the very least, they would have no problems staying alive.

Sou! Sou! Sou!

Streaks of light flew into Black Prison Tower. No matter what, all pre-war preparations were completed. They could respond to the start of a war anytime.

“Everyone.” Primal Chaos City Leader transmitted his voice clearly and gave very detailed instructions to over 100 universe masters in Black Prison Tower. “United forces camp will attack suddenly, and my guess is, they will arrive very soon! The strength of the united forces camp far surpasses ours. But there is no cause for worry. I have another piece of good news for you all. The Freedom Alliance has agreed to join us, the human camp. So long as we can press on for a time, we are bound to obtain victory in this war.”

“Luo Feng, Peng Gong, Darkness,” Primal Chaos City Leader looked towards the trio including Luo Feng. “You are all clear on what you must do.”

Luo Feng and the others nodded with smiles. Merely fight a war to pass the time! Very simple!

Primal Chaos City Leader transmitted his orders without delay. “All undying fighters and sector lords are to leave via god country transportation right away! Leave via god country transportation right away!”

Upon receiving his orders, within an instant, all servants and patrol guards who were originally situated within this core ground immediately reacted in an orderly manner. A group of sector lords would follow one undying, and this would make up one small team. Then a few small teams would make their escape together. Within a minute’s time, several hundred god country transportation waves appeared within the core ground of the primal secret region.

Primal Chaos City Leader also nodded silently. “Let’s set off then!” he commanded.

Luo Feng and the other two nodded as well. “Yes.”

As Darkness Master transformed into a streak of light and flew into Black Prison Tower, Luo Feng, Peng Gong Master, and Primal Chaos City Leader also transformed into streaks of light and flew toward the towering Star Tower that stood erected outside the palace.

In the primal secret region, there was a void space that was filled with a thin fog. With their mighty presence, 11 massive objects occupied this void space.

“We have entered the human’s primal secret region.”

“One more teleportation and we will arrive at the human’s core ground. Let’s prepare to fight a noteworthy war.”

“Let’s all prepare ourselves.”

“Now, I shall… unify our teleportation!”

The cold voice of Father God of automaton race resonated throughout the entire void space at the same time, as though his voice transmission could transcend time to reach out to any place of his choosing.

Hua!

Soundlessly, 11 massive palace true treasures vanished from the void space.

******

The secluded clusters of palaces were suspended in a particular area of this void space. Behind these clusters of palaces was a gigantic vessel, the Boat of Mausoleum, while in front of them, a towering nine-story tower stood erected: Star Tower. At that moment, there was not a single sound heard from these clusters of palaces; they were already devoid of living souls.

Weng!

In a particular spot, 11 towering palace true treasures suddenly appeared. Every single palace true treasure exuded a formidable force.

“How come there isn’t a single human to be found?”

“Emptiness!”

“No living soul. Not even living souls from other races can be found!”

They had just arrived, and every universe supreme master heading a troop within each palace true treasure was shocked to realize that this core ground had become a ghost town. They could not locate a single living soul, and this was the exact situation that worried them the most.

Right away, Black Universe Creator transmitted a report about the current situation. “Star Tower and the Boat of Mausoleum are there! Star Tower may be strong in defense, but it is still possible to cause it to waver. On the other hand, the Boat of Mausoleum… no matter how we attack, our efforts will be futile. That human camp must be afraid and timid, so they have all hidden inside the Boat of Mausoleum, where they can wait slowly for the Freedom Alliance to arrive.”

“Everyone, they are hiding in the Boat of Mausoleum, so there is no way we can touch them,” Devil Ancestor of Prison Clan replied via a voice transmission. “What should we do?”

“Loathsome humans. Timid humans.”

“They just ought to die.”

“How could they have learned so quickly that we had set off? We acted so quickly. By right, they should have been taken by surprise.”

The numerous universe supreme masters were all angry and displeased.

At that very moment—

Hong!

Suddenly, from one of the side doors on the ground floor of the lofty, nine-story tower—a black pyramid that was one billion kilometers tall—suddenly flew out. The deep abyss at the bottom of the tower had already opened, and a group of universe masters stood in a circle by the edge of this deep abyss. Darkness Master, Long Yan Master, Ice Mountain Master, and many universe masters from various races could be seen. A total of 139 universe masters were gathered in one place.

The moment Black Prison Tower made its appearance, 139 universe masters launched a joint soul attack.

“Attack!”

This overwhelming soul attack swept up everything around it, and since a soul attack was intangible, there was no way the naked eye could detect it whatsoever. All at once, 139 universe masters—even those who were more skilled in close-range combats and material attacks—were all executing soul attack techniques instead.

Hua!

Right away, the intangible soul attack charged toward a round-capped palace true treasure that was nearest to it.

“Not good.”

“Beware of the soul attack!”

The united forces camp could immediately sense something amiss. However, they had charged straight into the core ground right away, which meant that they were already very close to Star Tower. Furthermore, they had thought that the great beings of the human camp were hiding in the Boat of Mausoleum, so they did not exercise vigilance against Star Tower. A while later, over 100 universe masters were launching joint attacks focused on one of the eleven palace true treasures.

A pinnacle palace true treasure was not a supreme true treasure, so it was incapable of warding off a soul attack.

“Block it!” Devil Ancestor of Prison Clan roared in rage.

Hong! Long! Long!

A big group of universe masters in his surroundings were oblivious at the beginning, but as the soul attack closed in on them, naturally they started to sense it. They, too, executed soul attack techniques with their blurred godly power and threw their attacks at their opponent.

However, it was a force of 139 universe masters on the other side while they only had around 40 universe masters with a single universe supreme master. The difference was much too vast.

This was one disadvantage of dividing forces. By dividing themselves into 11 teams, indeed, the effect of Ancient God Eye would be greatly reduced, but at the same time, once any one team was attacked by the humans, it would almost be impossible to put up a resistance over such a terrifying attack.

So the ideal situation was for 11 troops to throw out attacks together and to rain down attacks until the humans were struggling to defend themselves, eventually reaching their breakdown point. This way, their opponents would not be able to attack and, of course, they were no longer threatening.

But judging by the exchange of blows earlier on, the joint soul attack by the humans was intangible, so by the time the united forces detected it, it was already too close to them. There was no way the other teams could make it in time to render help or block the attack. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Hong!

The mighty soul attack, upon breaking apart the resistance put up by Devil Ancestor of the prison clan and his team, immediately fell and hit them hard.

Devil Ancestor of the prison clan and around 40 universe masters in his team were all hit by the impact of the soul attack.

“Ah!”

“Ah!”

“Humans!”

At that moment, yells, curses, and roars all sounded at the same time. Yet no matter how they shouted and cursed, a number of universe masters, upon being hit by the impact, fell with a crash and completely lost consciousness.

“Attack! Attack! Attack!”

It was only then that the other ten teams arrived mightily and charged toward the human camp.

“Devil Ancestor, what should we do?”

“What’s our loss like?”

Right away, the universe masters were asking persistently.

Devil Ancestor transmitted his message. “We are still doing fine. Only one unlucky fellow has been annihilated.” Then he shouted another order: “Attack!”

The universe masters under his command who had made it through this ordeal immediately roared in rage and started to execute their attacks in a frenzied manner. They threw their attacks at Black Tower Prison in the distance.

The humans’ soul attack had previously been terrifying, but it had consumed quite a bit of power, and they were quite weakened. Furthermore, Devil Ancestor of the prison clan had immediately put himself before his team and resisted much of the impact from the attack. The others were only hit by the remaining impact of the aftermath. Universe masters were naturally extremely strong in soul defense; thus, only one unlucky universe master was unable to bear the force of the impact. As for the rest, though it was exhausting, they were all able to bear the impact and pull through to the end.

******

11 palace true treasures from the united force camp launched an overpowering attack capable of inundating everything between heaven and earth. Then, at the same time, they swept toward Black Prison Tower. Their might was so powerful that it threw the humans into a state of shock.

Sou!

Black Prison Tower, which was originally flying out of the side door of Star Tower, retreated back into Star Tower instantly.

“It’s too powerful. The attack from the united force camp is simply too powerful. We are not able to block it at all.” Darkness Master transmitted his reason for retreat right away.

Previously, when the human camp exchanged blows with the united force of the three races, the humans had suppressed to such a great extent that it was on the verge of collapsing. And at that time, the difference in power of both parties was much smaller than it was now.

This time around, it was 11 universe supreme masters and around 400 universe masters. The other party had over 100 universe masters. The difference in power was far too vast.

“Darkness Master continued with his report. “That palace true treasure that we attacked is now unleashing an outburst of powerful attacks, and the teams in the other palace true treasures were all comparable to one another. Primal Chaos City Leader, from the ambush we laid just now… there should be nothing much to gain. At most, we would have killed one to two universe masters, or maybe none were harmed at all.”

“Then for now, we shall wait,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “Wait inside Star Tower. Wait for the Freedom Alliance to arrive.”

Behind another side door within Star Tower were Luo Feng, Primal Chaos City Leader, and Peng Gong Master.
