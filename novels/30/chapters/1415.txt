Chapter 1416: The Great Army of Universe Ocean

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Primal Universe, within the borders of Ganwu Universe, Milky Way Holy Land.

The present-day Milky Way Holy Land was known as one of the two major centers of the human race. One center was the primal secret region. The other was Milky Way Holy Land. As the human race was now powerful enough, Remote Ocean was no longer required to stay within the primal secret region. This was why Luo Feng had first shifted it into a god country before changing it again from a god country to Milky Way Holy Land.

With the endless Remote Ocean, Milky Way Holy Land had six true gods and over 100 universe masters; it even had universe knights and countless undying fighters. It was where Luo Feng, the number one master of Universe Ocean, resided. The entire Milky Way Holy Land had already been expanded, with various clusters of palaces in undulating waves all over. Amongst them, there was a vast piece of the starry land that belonged to Hong, and another vast piece belonged to Fire Dome. These two lands already occupied close to the entire Milky Way.

“Fire Dome.” Luo Feng, garbed in his white robe and walked along the corridor of the void space. Following close behind him was a youth with long, red hair. He might have seemed like a youth, but he was actually “Fire Dome True God’, the illustrious super talent whose teacher was Luo Feng, the number one master of Universe Ocean.

“Teacher,” Fire Dome said, bowing with reverence.

Luo Feng spoke as he walked. “I imparted to you the inheritance of the pulse of Jie Fanzi and also the inheritances of various pulses of the World of Jin. You are, unquestionably, extremely gifted. Your secret technique has also attained an extremely high level of achievement. However, your willpower is apparently hindering your path to perfection. Right now, your willpower is only at the true god level… As a true god, this level of willpower is much too weak.”

“You disciple understands.” Again, Fire Dome bowed reverentially as he responded.

Inwardly, Luo Feng lamented. Both he and Hong were from the pulse of Earth. As great beings from Earth, so long as they were outstanding figures, their willpower should have been more determined and powerful. But this second disciple of his was relatively weaker in this respect.

“When the next era is here, you will head for the World of Jin. I will make the necessary arrangements. Going there will allow you to hone your willpower. If your willpower can be increased to the void space level, I can start imparting willpower secret techniques to you.” Luo Feng gave Fire Dome one brief glance.

Immediately, Fire Dome became extremely excited and said, “I will definitely do my best and not disappoint you, Teacher.”

He could not forget that back when he had first become a true god and went to the World of Jin to hone his skills, he had considered himself to be among the top tier of true gods. He was full of confidence. In light of this, facing his Teacher—named “Number One Master of Universe Ocean”—he was eager for a chance to learn through sparring.

Luo Feng saw through his thoughts with a mere glance and said, “You can try. Put in all you’ve got.”

So Fire Dome executed his secret technique of blazing his godly power and made use of his automaton-type treasure as he readied himself as thoroughly as he could.

Yet all it took was one look from Luo Feng!

One single look, and Fire Dome instantly felt as though the time and space around him vanished. What remained were only those incomparably terrorizing eyes that could drown out everything in a fleeting moment. Right away, Fire Dome lost consciousness and crashed to the ground!

Every time he recalled his first time facing Teacher… Just one look from Teacher, and he had been knocked out right away! Fire Dome had always found the willpower secret technique from Teacher’s set of knowledge overwhelming. Yet, at the same time, he yearned to learn more about it. The numerous disciples under Luo Feng all knew that their teacher had an extremely powerful willpower secret technique, yet up until now, none had been able to inherit it.

According to Luo Feng, “It is not me refusing to impart the technique to you. It is just that for all of you, your willpower simply does not reach the threshold for cultivating the technique.”

What a stinging remark!

“Huh?” Luo Feng’s expression suddenly changed.

“Teacher…?” Fire Dome was in doubt as he started to ask a question. Then he too showed a change in expression as he exclaimed in shock, “Sector Beast!”

“Sector Beast…” Luo Feng said slowly. “Finally, it’s here.”

Then Luo Feng looked up.

Far in the distance, a figure appeared. It transformed into a streak of flowing light and sped toward Luo Feng. Very quickly, the figure descended. This black-haired man garbed in a black robe was none other than Hong.

“You sensed it, too?” Luo Feng nodded. “Big brother and Fire Dome, both of you have to come along with me. We will go look for Firefly True Master.”

Hong walked over, shaking his head while sighing. “Previously, I suffered a loss because of this Sector Beast. Who would have expected another Sector Beast to appear in such a short time? I’m afraid the reason is because Eye Devil God and I went over to their territory. Thus, those Sector Beasts also thought about the idea of coming out. Only after you have truly fought against one will you understand how truly terrifying these Sector Beasts are. Luo Feng… This time, we really need to depend on you.”

“Let’s wait and see first. No one knows exactly how strong this Sector Beast is.” Luo Feng instantly waved and—Hua! A nine-story tower appeared. “Let’s go.”

Luo Feng was the first to walk towards the doors of Star Tower, with Hong and Fire Dome closely behind as all three entered. At that moment, another figure was approaching from the distance. It was Mosha body, and it, too, followed the rest, entering Star Tower.

Luo Feng was exercising extremely high vigilance. Even though he had many treasures with him, in terms of defense, Star Tower was still extremely powerful. His Remote Ocean body and Mosha body had set off at the same time. And even if Mosha body were to lose and perish in the war, Remote Ocean body could still take over the treasures left behind by Mosha body after it was destroyed.

“Divine eye.” Amidst the chaotic airflow, Luo Feng and company were on board Star Tower, rushing their way to Firefly True Master. Luo Feng took out a transmission token. “What? You are unable to make your way there quickly?”

“Milky Way, these Sector Beasts have appeared outside Firefly True Master’s miniature universe. No one knows exactly how many have come to Universe Ocean. It might be quite a few. If we all set off for Firefly True Master’s miniature universe at the same time, what if other Sector Beasts suddenly appear and charge into my miniature universe…? I would not be able to rush back in time. This would spell big trouble. I have already sent two of my true gods, who are rushing over now. After all, even if we discover the presence of Sector Beasts, we need to alert all the groups of powers from Universe Ocean into leaping into action.”

Luo Feng understood his point of view. It was similar to why he left his Golden Horned Beast body in the primal universe. He could disintegrate another body of himself anytime he wanted and bring it back to its original form when it was within the endless Remote Ocean.

“Nine-Headed, all right, all right. I am rushing over too,” said Luo Feng, transmitting his instructions to another top-tiered great being. “Your miniature universe is also near Firefly Master’s miniature universe. You make your way over first and keep the situation under control. I will rush over as fast as I can.”

Of the eight great overlords of Universe Ocean, Luo Feng served covertly as the leader, and at that very moment, he was speedily trying to establish contact with every single one.

This time, out of the eight great overlords, three were rushing over. Other than those three, there were many other true gods. For instance, from the human race itself, as many as seven true gods were rushing over. Clearly, this was the first time a Sector Beast had made an appearance in the Universe Ocean, as the various powerful groups were exercising extreme caution and vigilance.

******

The various true gods were all at different distances from Firefly True Master’s miniature universe. Some were near, while others were very far away. Luo Feng, who had set off from the primal universe, would have been considered to be very far away.

After all, among the three reincarnation eras, numerous true gods’ miniature universes from the first reincarnation era were far from the primal universe. They were scattered far, and even within the first reincarnation era, distances between the various miniature universes differed. Some were closer to one another, some were equally distant from one another.

Time continued passing by, and around the membrane wall of Firefly True Master’s miniature universe, almost half of Firefly True Master’s meandering body was out of the membrane wall as it gazed far into the distance.

“No! Loathsome.”

Firefly True Master was very anxious. It could clearly feel the origin of its miniature universe being continually eaten away. It was the most fundamental form of encroachment. It was almost impossible to recover; an immeasurably long period would be required just to recover to only a small degree. That was also why the willpower of the primal universe origin was so dreadful.

“What should I do, what should I do?”

Firefly True Master was filled with anxiety, but it did not dare leave without even a single automaton-type treasure—especially when Control Dark Master, who was under its command, had been swallowed the moment it encountered that Sector Beast. This further eroded Firefly True Master’s confidence.

“Ancestor.”

By his side, there were several other universe masters from his Firefly clan.

“Ancestor, even if the various parties are rushing over, they are, after all, rushing from all corners of Universe Ocean. They will need time. The number one master of our Universe Ocean, Milky Way Horde Leader, will need to travel from the primal universe.”

“Milky Way Horde Leader will not be able to make it in such a short time.”

“The nearer they are to us, the faster they will be able to make it here. However, those nearer to us might not come. Some of the true gods are worried that they, too, might get attacked by the Sector Beast.”

These universe masters were all very anxious too.

******

“Hahaha…”

Amidst the void space, Sector Beast Morosa stood tall. Rays of distorted light penetrated the endless void space to swallow the origin of that faraway miniature universe.

“How gutless,” said Sector Beast Morosa. “The origin of his own miniature universe is being swallowed by me. How can that Firefly True Master possibly be unaware? In the very beginning, he had sent one universe master over to look into the matter. Yet since then, there hasn’t been a single move made. Obviously, it was fearful of me, and thus, did not dare to deal with me. Haha! It seems I have overestimated Universe Ocean. I’m afraid the various races of Universe Ocean are pretty weak after all.”

Sector Beast Morosa was exhilarated. It had prepared well for a war, but it had not expected that, even after waiting for quite some time, Firefly True Master would make no move other than to send a universe master to probe around. After that, it had made no further moves.

Firefly True Master was truly anxious.

A piece of news was transmitted over. “Firefly, I have arrived.”

One of the clawed hoofs of Firefly True Master grasped a transmission token, and the moment it received this news, it was instantly delighted. “Blood Orchid, you are here? I have been so worried. Some of the other true gods are either scared or worried about their own universes and simply stayed away from here. There are others who are rushing over from very faraway places. Blood Orchid, my coordinates are…” Firefly True Master was extremely agitated.

“I will be there immediately,” came the reply.

Firefly True Master was very excited as he looked around. “Blood Orchid Ancestor will arrive soon.”

“Blood Orchid Ancestor?”

“With Blood Orchid Ancestor here, things will be much better.”

“Blood Orchid Ancestor and my Firefly clan did share a relationship with one another, and when such something happens, she is the first to come and help. As for the other three miniature universes nearest to us, not a single one came.”

The universe masters all sighed while lamenting how true friends could be identified only at the most crucial moments.

A short while later—

Hua!

A black, triangular tower teleported over and appeared in the vicinity. Then it flew over rapidly. Firefly True Master raced to receive it as it came to a halt and a towering figure walked out. She was surrounded by countless crimson flowers, looking very finely adorned. It was her: Blood Orchid Ancestor!

Back when the World of Jin had yet to emerge, three true gods had frequently stayed around the black-striped stone pillars. They were Bei Chi Star Master, Blood Orchid Ancestor, and Rampaging Devil God. When the World of Jin had emerged, Blood Orchid Ancestor had made her way there, as expected. After spending a period of time honing her skills, she had become more powerful. In terms of power, she was not far below the eight major overlords. If the eight major overlords were said to be the top-notch team, she would have been regarded as second only to them.

Her greatest advantage was her body. As a plant life form, Blood Orchid Ancestor had a massive body. At the moment, she took the form of a woman surrounded by flowers. However, that was only a transformation that she took on. It was not her original look.

Previously, she had spent quite a long time at the black-striped stone pillars, so her willpower was extremely strong, too.

“Me?” Blood Orchid Ancestor looked in the distance at the numerous universe masters of the Firefly Clan, then turned toward Firefly True Master with a dubious look. “It’s just me alone?”

Firefly True Master wandered over and said a bit awkwardly, “The other true masters were quite far away, so they have yet to arrive. Milky Way Horde Leader, Nine-Headed Demon Master, and Nine Remoteness True Master are also in the process of rushing here now.”
