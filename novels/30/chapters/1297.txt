Chapter 1299: Division of the Camps

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In the core ground of the primal secret region, the palaces of Luo Feng and Primal Chaos City Leader were scattered all over the area. Thousand Treasure River was rippling, and a nine-story tower that was several tens of billions of kilometers tall was being suspended right in the middle of Thousand Treasure River.

“Eh?” A figure suddenly flew out from within the tower. He wore black all over and was looking down at the sight before him.

“Snow Sand Ocean!”

Mosha Luo Feng quickly took control of the situation. At one time, the boundless Snow Sand Ocean was rapidly moving to enshroud the surrounding area of around ten billion kilometers, so naturally, the palace where Luo Feng resided, along with part of the base of Star Tower, would be enshrouded.

Hong!

The turbulent waters of Remote Ocean directly surged out of the palace where Luo Feng resided like a water dragon—at a speed that was almost as fast as the speed of light. At the base of Star Tower, a side door adjacent to Luo Feng’s palace opened. This side door was around one billion kilometers tall, so jets of ocean water columns surged in easily.

Mosha Luo Feng was drifting about amidst the icy, snow-white sand grains with brows slightly furrowed. “The water column has a diameter of 100,000 kilometers. Even if it charges over almost as fast as the light of speed… to turn the entire endless Remote Ocean around, I will still need a long, long time.”

Indeed, it would take an extremely long time. Until today, the diameter of the water column was only 100,000 kilometers, while the endless Remote Ocean was a massive ocean with a diameter of 80 billion kilometers.

This water column continued erupting at the speed of light, yet even if the eruptions were still consistent after one year, it was still only a small part of the entire endless Remote Ocean. There were many universe masters whose godly bodies were not even 10,000 kilometers tall, but for this column of the ocean water of Luo Feng’s endless Remote Ocean, even after one year of transportation, the Remote Ocean showed no trace of movement at all. This showed how vast it truly was.

“I still need to continue establishing god country transportation passageways,” Mosha body said to himself.

Hong!

Mosha body was here while the original earthling body was in god country. They both worked single-mindedly to start establishing stationary god country transportation passageways. Stationary god country transportation passageways were very common sights. Ordinary undying fighters such as the emperor of Black Dragon Mountain empire could also construct such stationary passageways. Or perhaps, to an ordinary undying, this might not be a small price. But to Luo Feng? Even if he were to construct 10,000 or even one million of such stationary transportation passageways. It would be something so simple and casual to him.

“Rise. Fix!” Mosha Luo Feng pointed to one of the empty grounds on the courtyard of his palace. That area had an approximate diameter of one million kilometers, and the entire passageway speedily fixed and stabilized.

A god country transportation passageway could be big or small. The smaller it was, the easier it was to construct; the bigger it was, the more stable it had to be, so the more difficult it was to construct. Especially when the god country transportation passageway continued to expand, the price to pay would soar accordingly. Luo Feng might own quite a sizable fortune, so it did not affect him at all, but he was also unwilling to waste too much of his fortune. When he was constructing the entrances of these god country transportation passageways, the largest diameter would normally be one million kilometers, and the smallest would be a few tens of thousands of kilometers.

One after the other, passageways were established!

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Numerous water columns of Remote Ocean—be it immeasurably thick or extremely fine—surged and gushed toward that side door like thousands of horses galloping together at a high speed that could almost match the speed of light. That side door was, after all, as tall as 100 billion kilometers, so it could easily accommodate the impact of so many water columns of the Remote Ocean. However, as the number of passageways continued to increase, Star Tower was forced to expand further, and this expansion took place in all other directions possible.

That was still acceptable. The space of the core ground was enormous. After all, Thousand Treasure River spread over an area of a few light years, which was a good measure of how vast and wide that space was.

Star Tower continued to expand to hundreds of billions of kilometers tall, then continued expanding. Eventually, all the side doors and the deep abyss at the base of Star Tower opened to accommodate more and more ocean water flowing in from the Remote Ocean.

“Construct, construct, construct.” Luo Feng was constructing without restraint. “Too slow, too slow, too slow.”

He was also frustrated over how massive the endless Remote Ocean was. However, he could only continue to construct god country passageways painstakingly. As many as one million passageways fully occupied the surroundings of Luo Feng’s palace grounds, and their total surface area added up to a diameter of 100 billion kilometers.

Even so, within three days, the endless Remote Ocean was fully transported into Star Tower from god country.

Within these three days, many great beings from various races, and even some undying fighters, sector lords, and guards of the human race were filled with doubts. Why would that endless Snow Sand Ocean envelop such a great piece of domain? Yet, even if they were dying of curiosity, there was no way they could seek comprehension.

Within Star Tower. In a vast, individual space, the water of the endless Remote Ocean was flowing out. Luo Feng, Darkness Master, Primal Chaos City Leader, and Peng Gong Master were positioned above this space.

“I consider myself to have truly experienced this.” Darkness Master sighed. “These three days, I have stayed around and truly felt how massive this endless Remote Ocean is! With a passageway with a diameter as wide as 10,000 kilometers, even if you take one to ten years to transport, or even up to 100 years, it would still be very far behind. If this was the transportation of my godly body, I don’t even need the time for a blink of an eye.

Primal Chaos City Leader laughed and said, “Otherwise, how could Nine Remoteness Master’s Nine Remoteness Ocean be considered comparable to a supreme true treasure? Because the other races were completely helpless against his Nine Remoteness Ocean… that’s why it is worthy enough to be compared to a supreme true treasure.”

Peng Gong Master looked down with great envy. Such a massive godly body!

“It’s overly massive. Moving it is tedious and difficult,” Luo Feng said, mocking himself. “You see, just moving it here from my god country has consumed so much of my strength. I’ve been constructing transportation passageways like crazy because I can only depend on these transportation passageways to gradually channel over the ocean water of the endless Remote Ocean.”

In fact, Luo Feng had been racking his brains for a solution on how to transfer the endless Remote Ocean over.

Because the endless Remote Ocean could only move about in its entirety, and it moved so slowly that it was almost tortoise-like speed. In the beginning, Luo Feng had to bring Star Tower into god country. Then Star Tower was expanded to a massive size so that ocean water from the endless Remote Ocean could gush into Star Tower all at once. This would facilitate the transfer well. This was earlier on, when Luo Feng was still quite weak.

He once had to depend on Star Tower to achieve such a transfer! However, that was when Remote Ocean was still small! And the level of its godly power was weak! But now…everything was different.

Upon bearing the entire endless Remote Ocean, the speed at which Star Tower moved became ridiculously slow! Luo Feng felt overwhelmed by exhaustion. Even if the speed of movement was slow, making use of god country transportation passageway, it should be able to move fast. Yet the truth was, when Star Tower barely made it to the entrance of the god country transportation passageway, it caused the entire god country transportation passageway to collapse!

The oppressive force exerted on Star Tower after bearing the endless Remote Ocean was simply overwhelming! God country transportation passageway was too weak and fragile by comparison; there was no way it could accommodate a Star Tower that was bearing the endless Remote Ocean.

Luo Feng was dumbfounded, too. Could it be there was no way he could transfer Star Tower that was bearing the endless Remote Ocean?

Fortunately, Luo Feng recalled that he could establish more god country transportation passageways so that the ocean water from the endless Remote Ocean water could directly flow through. This ocean water from the Remote Ocean was well-suited for flowing. Naturally, it was fast and efficient. This made Luo Feng sigh in relief. Luckily, this took the form of ocean water. If this was a massive mountain range or a world tree or the likes of it, he would have worries such as whether he was able to construct a god country transportation passageway that was so massive!

******

No matter what, after painstakingly going through various hardships, he finally managed to move endless Remote Ocean from the primal secret region into Star Tower with the use of god country transportation. Then Luo Feng stored Snow Sand Ocean and everything resumed peace and quiet. Those great beings from various other races were filled with doubts, but still, they were unaware of what happened over the past three days.

Following this, the human race started a long and slow wait. Various methods were in place. They were just pending the replies of the various groups of powers.

“The Ancestral God School has promised to join the human camp!”

“The Ancestral God School has requested that we give them a part of that guidance first. Then, after the war, we will give the other part.”

“All right.”

“Haha…! With the Ancestral God School joining the human camp, it will be equivalent to gaining three more ‘sixth-tier as the top level’ combat powers. And the Ancestral God School has two supreme true treasures.”

The moment they heard this piece of news, the sea of humans was a scene of jubilation. On the contrary, the united forces camp was in a rage when they learned of the news. The internal disagreements within the Freedom Alliance went on. When they heard that Ancestral God School had chosen to join the human camp, these disagreements within the Alliance grew even more heated! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

******

Updates arrived successively.

“Black Universe Creator has decided to join the united force camp!”

“Northern Territory Alliance Master has decided to join the united force camp!”

“E Zhou is joining united force camp!”

“Virtual Real Devil God is joining united force camp!”

The humans might be feeling bouts of pressure, but they continued to prepare themselves. Since the humans had no intentions of giving out information on cultivating to reach the ultimate limit of a universe supreme master, it was a fact that these supreme masters who traveled alone were not going to help the humans. On the other hand, the united force camp was rejoicing.

******

At that very moment, the division of powers between the two sides was gradually coming to light. Other than Sitting Mountain Guest, Demon Beast Ancestor, and a few other great beings who had not made their stand yet, the majority of the groups of powers had already announced their decisions. Now, only the Space Beast Alliance and Freedom Alliance had yet to make their final choice.

“The Space Beast Alliance has sent its envoy here again. Quite an eloquent one, he even said that imparting them information on cultivating to reach the ultimate limit of a universe supreme master will not affect the overall situation that the primal universe is in… Through the conversation, it is so obvious that there is a hint of a threat, and apparently, this Space Beast Alliance is also contemplating whether or not it should join the united force camp.”

“There is no need to bother about him. Now, the Freedom Alliance’s decision is our greatest concern.”

******

Right now, within the entire primal universe, various groups of races were all looking toward the Freedom Alliance. It was the most important source of strength, especially with the united forces camp’s increase in ability, which had already surpassed the human camp’s power by leaps and bounds. But the moment the Freedom Alliance decided to help the humans, then no matter what, the united forces camp was destined for failure.

Fight! The internal disagreements within the Freedom Alliance were severe.

The majority wanted to join the human camp. At least they could obtain the guidance from the cultivation experience of the ancient civilization on how they could cultivate to achieve the universe supreme master level.

The other part of the Freedom Alliance—including Shi Hua Island Leader—wanted to pressure the humans into acquiescing to their demands. Otherwise, they would join the united forces camp as a way of threatening the humans.

The differences between both parties, especially when the situation within the entire primal universe eventually depended on their decisions, became even more serious. The more aggressive party headed by Shi Hua Island Leader and the more stable party that consisted of the various other groups were engaged in an extremely intense fight against one another.

******

It was the third month since the endless Remote Ocean had entered Star Tower.

“Luo Feng.”

“Teacher.”

Luo Feng met with Primal Chaos City Leader.

“Come over to Earth as fast as you can,” Primal Chaos City Leader requested. “The avatar of the alliance master of the Freedom Alliance, ‘Shi Hua Island Leader,’ has landed on Earth this very moment.”

“Landed on Earth?” Luo Feng frowned.

“Yes. He is here alone to negotiate with us humans.” Primal Chaos City Leader was very solemn as he continued. “Because we have many great beings of various races in our primal secret region right now, he is unwilling to disclose his identity… Therefore, the venue for negotiations will be on Earth. Seems like Shi Hua Island Leader intends to help the human camp.”

“Alone?” Luo Feng seemed to have an inkling of what was going on. “What Teacher means to say is that he is not representing the Freedom Alliance… but representing only himself?”

Primal Chaos City Leader nodded slightly.

“All right, I will go and meet up with him.” Luo Feng nodded.

The individual being sent for negotiations was a clear reflection of the degree of importance. Currently, within the human camp, the ones of the highest status would be Primal Chaos City Leader, Luo Feng, Darkness, and Peng Gong. Out of these four, the status of Primal Chaos City Leader and Luo Feng were of higher importance.
