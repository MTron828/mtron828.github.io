Chapter 1341: Go In

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The head of the giant object was enormous, and there were true treasure palaces on top of it. Almost 90 percent of the great beings in Universe Ocean were around the head.

“It’s enormous.”

“This must be the mouth of that human shape object.”

Boat of Mausoleum landed. Luo Feng, Primal Chaos City Leader, and the other great beings from the Hong Alliance were all looking into the distance, amazed. There was a vast abyss in front of them, and judging by the outer shape of the giant object, it had its mouth closed, yet the abyss was only a crack between its lips.

That abyss was 1.9 million light years long, and it was 120,000 light years at its widest. Even Luo Feng’s domain true treasures could only inspect a small part of it. Ten milky way galaxies could have filled this crack.

Sou! Sou!

Streaks of light appeared above the abyss and shot out.

“Quick, quick. If there are valuables in this giant object, those who find them first can get them! Quick!”

All the powers were nervous. Although they were frightened and intimidated by the giant object, they were still keen to find out more about it, which was why they immediately sent universe masters with multiple bodies to check.

“Let’s go, Luo Feng.”

“Chaos!”

The great beings in the Hong Alliance were nervous as well. The valuables were on a first-come-first-serve base, and everyone knew it. They were nervous upon seeing all the other powers sending great beings.

Primal Chaos City Leader looked around and said, “We know nothing about this giant object. We don’t know how dangerous it is inside. Even universe supreme masters can’t guarantee they can survive it. We’ll send universe masters with multiple bodies in first. Then, even if they die, they will only lose a body and some true treasures. The main entryways of that giant head are the ears, the nostrils, and the crack between the lips. We might enter separately through different portals.”

Nobody knew which entryway led to the valuables, which was why they would need to try all of them.

“Okay. I’ll go.”

“I’ll go, too.”

Great beings were very efficient, and they transmitted their voices using their godly power. Immediately, eight universe masters decided to send bodies in, including Luo Feng.

Primal Chaos City Leader said, “Everyone who’s going in, be careful. Also, when you enter, please record your route. Then other great beings from the Hong Alliance can learn from it. Now, everyone, off you go.”

“Let’s go.”

“Go.”

The gate of Boat of Mausoleum opened.

Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!

Streaks of light flew out swiftly, including a black, oval-shaped palace. Other great beings from the Hong Alliance were all looking at the great beings of their team, including Primal Chaos City Leader. They all wished that they could get the huge chance contained in that giant object.

Inside the black, oval-shaped palace, Luo Feng stood looking at the outside. He was wearing black armor and carrying a blade. A blurry black light permeated the oval-shaped palace, centered on him. It covered an area of several square light years. This was Luo Feng’s Mosha body.

“Inspection,” he muttered.

Luo Feng was full of expectation. Actually, he only carried his golden horned beast body and the earthling original body while journeying in Universe Ocean. However, for the present purpose of inspection, he had immediately sent his Mosha body, which had been in the original universe, back to Remote Ocean and killed it. The true treasures carried by his Mosha body had been kept by endless Remote Ocean. Then Luo Feng immediately had spared some godly power from his golden horned beast body and condensed a new Mosha body.

Mosha body had a life gene level of 5,000 times, and it was 10,000 kilometers tall. Its godly power wasn’t even 1/1,000th that of his golden horned beast body, so it was okay for the golden horned beast to spare that much.

As for the valuables that Mosha body was carrying now, they had been obtained over the course of the past eight million years. Luo Feng had kept some true treasures he had obtained from Jie Fanzi after donating most of them to his race. He had also journeyed throughout Universe Ocean in Boat of Mausoleum, so he had obtained quite a few true treasures, meaning it had been easy for him to get a set of true treasures.

The armor and the blade Mosha body was carrying were both pinnacle true treasures, but they were only ordinary pinnacle true treasures. As for pinnacle palace type and domain type true treasures, they were much more precious.

“It’s done.”

“Let’s see what’s inside that giant object.” Mosha Luo Feng drove the black, oval-shaped palace, performing short-distance teleportation time and time again. Each time, he only teleported within the domain range. He also documented his route while he was moving forward.

******

In Universe Ocean, three beings walked out of the wormhole shoulder to shoulder.

“Based on Nine Remoteness, the powers from Universe Ocean can’t wait anymore, so they sent some great beings in. Regardless, they were careful enough to only send those with bodies. At least most of them did that.”

“They’ll soon realize how terrifying that fourth Land of Extremis is.”

“Not our business. We’ll just move at normal speed. As for the death toll, it’s their luck. Tell Nine Remoteness and the others. Other than those like Nine Remoteness who are not afraid of death, others can’t go in. Although we know about this fourth Land of Extremis, we can’t spill the secret.”

The three ancestral gods went because they received an order from the original mind. They knew about the secret, yet they didn’t dare to leak it to their great beings. As ancestral gods, they benefited greatly, yet there were still many rules that they needed to follow.

Hong!

The giant object kept slowing down under the chaos air. Eventually—

Hong! Long! Long!

It completely stopped.

“The human-shaped object has fully stopped.”

“That armor… Is it decorative? Or is it a valuable like the armors we’re wearing? Let’s see whether we can make it recognize us as owners.”

The great beings who remained outside had many thoughts. They believed that powerful valuables would recognize masters, so they all endeavored to give it a go. However, before the great beings landed, there were already those who had tried. They had all failed.

That giant armor was like a decoration. It was not subject to master recognition, and no matter how it was attacked, it wasn’t damaged even in the slightest.

******

Luo Feng entered via the crack between the lips. He was driving a true treasure palace and teleporting at a short distance. He was very fast, and soon enough, he had already traveled ten million light years forward. That giant object had already stopped.

“An endless abyss.”

Inside the palace, Mosha Luo Feng looked down, and he couldn’t see the bottom. He looked to his side, but he couldn’t see the end, either! It appeared endless! He could only see the exit dimming at the front, and using his domain type true treasure, he could tell that there wasn’t any route at the front. He had to go down.

“Go down!”

Hong!

The black, oval-shaped palace immediately dove down, and it started to teleport at a high frequency again.

“Huh? There’s a huge area that my domain true treasure can’t detect,” Mosha Luo Feng said.

He overjoyed. Ever since he started detecting, he hadn’t been able to find anything out of the ordinary. In dangerous places in Universe Boat and Tilted Peak Sector, domain true treasures couldn’t detect them. He had been in this giant object for a long time, and this was the first time his domain true treasure wasn’t able to detect something.

“I’ll go and see.”

He drove the black oval palace and got closer. After half an hour, Mosha Luo Feng looked to the front in the palace.

“That is…”

Hong! Long! Long!

An endless whirlpool appeared in his sight. The whirlpool twisted the space, spreading outward.

“A natural wormhole?”

Mosha Luo Feng could immediately tell that it was a natural wormhole.

“That wormhole is too large and too powerful,” he said. “Only universe masters and those stronger could get through such twisted energies. I haven’t seen a natural wormhole this big in Universe Ocean or in the original universe.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Mosha Luo Feng was thrilled. Apparently, the natural wormhole led to another area.

“Go. Go deeper.”

Mosha Luo Feng drove the true treasure palace, dodged the natural wormhole, and kept diving.

All great beings who inspected dangerous places knew that there were two ways to move forward in dangerous areas: teleportation and flying! Teleportation could take them to areas that could be inspected, and great beings only did that when they could make sure the area was safe. Flying was far less risky. At least great beings wouldn’t fall into dangerous places without a fight.

As for natural wormholes, nobody knew what was on the other side. Wormholes in Universe Ocean and the original universe were okay. As for those in Universe Boat, Tilted Peak Sector, Flowing Level Mountain, and this giant object, nobody would enter.

“Move forward!”

The abyss seemed to have no end, but it appeared safe. Mosha Luo Feng drove the true treasure palace and kept moving forward, teleporting.

“There’s no end, no end. I’ve been here for 15 days.”

On the 15th day, Mosha Luo Feng lost his patience a bit. After all, there were lots of dangerous areas in the other three Lands of Extremis, yet there seemed to be nothing but an endless abyss in this giant object with nothing in it, and teleportation was allowed everywhere.

Hu!

A freezing breeze suddenly blew by. Even though Luo Feng’s domain true treasure covered an area of several square light years, it couldn’t detect the breeze. It was completely silent.

It blew through the black, oval-shaped true treasure palace, which was suddenly like dust, crumbling and separating, spreading across the ground and disintegrating into nothing. As for Mosha Luo Feng inside the oval palace true treasure, he only felt cold before his godly power was completely frozen.

The blade, the armor, and Mosha Luo Feng himself all turned into dust, spreading, and disintegrating into nothing.

In the endless abyss, there still seemed to be no danger. It was tranquil, and teleportation was still possible everywhere. But Mosha Luo Feng and the true treasure palace he drove had all turned to nothing. It was as if they had never been here.
