Chapter 535: Too Valuable

As the white robed Yuke and Kuyan left with the 8 envoys, Luo Feng left the palace too.

Sou!

He became a beam of green light rushing into the sky, quickly reaching his huge pit quarters.

“Undying shrine, Beast god statue?” Luo Feng looked at the skies. He could see 1,000 li in the sky, and there, a dark purple disc shaped ship floated around.

“Beast god statue!” Luo Feng recalled the statue.

Howl!

Li!

Looking at that statue was almost like looking at a live ancient beast itself.

Through the statue and its mysterious energy, he could feel the ancient beast’s first calw scene. Such artistic grace, unleashing an attack that could destroy the entire land and skies, it was so natural! The ancient beast’s claw was one that was infused with both universe laws and ground and sky laws.

It came into contact with almost every law!

Looking at the beast statue, the golden horned beast too had some revelations. It could use this to understand how to improve in its training. Maybe the statue wasn’t as godly as the 9 universe tablet.

However, to the golden horned beast, its importance was maybe even higher than the 9 universe tablet to it.

The only thing was that the statue was protected by two sector lords now.

“Hmph.” Luo Feng thought, and entered his huge pit quarters.

Blood river world space, Tian Shi palace.

This palace was located in space. In terms of size, it wasn’t smaller than a planet.

Within the 1st level of the palace, a group of sector lords in charge of surveillance were shocked as they looked at the huge screen.

“Ah, His majesty Luo Feng’s automaton ship has entered Blood River world.”

“Luo Feng’s ship, it’s been in space for so long. Why enter it now?”

“He’s preparing to return?”

“Be on your toes.”

The group of sector lords didn’t dare relax. Right now, Luo Feng was heavily favored by the upper echelons of the Virtual Universe company. In terms of position, he was much higher than the group of sector lords.

……

15th cloud level, the dark purple disc shaped ship was flying swiftly.

In the 18th cloud level, disguised fully as a cloud was a silver white pyramid automaton ship. It too was swiftly flying. In terms of speed and flexibility…this undying automaton ship was much better in many aspects compared to the Yun Mo planet ship, much less the technologically backward ships of Blood River world.

Automaton ship, control room.

Black clothed Luo Feng sat in the sofa. A light screen appeared before it, and on it there was a marker.

“Beast god statue, I definitely have to get it. The 9 universe tablet, it’s hard to get even one chance to study it, and each time, there is a allowed study period of only 7 days. And this statue…is extremely important to the golden horned beast.” Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed. In the vast universe, the strong preyed on the weak, and many races were destroyed and extinct due to this law of the jungle.

Everything was based on strength!

Even though the points from the blood river crystal were very important, and his rewards this time were huge, the beast god statue was hundreds to thousands of times more valuable than the 100k points!

“No matter what, I have to get it.” Luo Feng thought.

“Master, the target has been acquired. Currently maintaining a distance of 1.6million km.” The AI from the automaton ship spoke.

“Activate star annihilator cannon!” Luo Feng said coldly.

“Yes!” The ship’s AI wouldn’t defy him in the least.

A voice however resounded in the control room, shouting, “Luo Feng, what are you doing, why are you activating the star annihilator cannon? That’s a star annihilator cannon, and is comparable to an undying’s full attack. Just one shot can completely destroy a planet! The amount of energy used is shocking too. The automaton’s reserves aren’t that much, your one shot will use 1/3 of the reserves!”

While Babata was shouting in rage…

The control room resounded with the AI’s voice, “Star annihilator cannon 1 countdown, 60…59…58…”

“There’s a treasure I need to get from that ship.” Black clothed Luo Feng said coldly.

“Damn, is there a treasure that requires you to use this cannon? A star annihilator cannon is one of the pinnacle weapons in the entire human race of the universe. One shot is akin to an undyings full attack. However, because of its dispersed attack, it cannot be as condensed as a true undying, hence it cannot kill an undying. However, anything under an undying…will definitely be reduced to ashes! Aren’t you worried that the treasure you want will be destroyed too?”

The black clothed Luo Feng said coldly, “That’s a statue made of jade gold from Blood River continent.”

“Jade gold? Hm…” Babata seemed to realize, muttering, “What a waste.”

18 beast god statues, were from an era before a war over trillions of years ago.

Most of them had been retrieved, yet none of them seemed to be damaged in the least. Obviously, to actually damage these statues was extremely hard, even the undyings found it hard to do!

Even if one broke through a space ring, with the space inside broken, the statues would still remain unharmed.

Even after an undying is killed, the statues were still in perfect condition.

Undying shrine…

They’ve always regarded the statues as extremely important items to be worshiped. As their history was very special, what they represented was terrifying. Hence the undying shrine worshipped these statues! Other than the fact that they remained in perfect condition over countless years, the undyings had yet to find any other special use for them.

“30…29…28…” The countdown in the control room continued!

……

About 1.6million km from the automaton ship, the dark purple ship was flying.

Whether it was the automaton race or the human race, they mostly battled in space. Since the area in space was vast and unlimited, their scanning radius was naturally huge too. Much less this…automaton ship was made from a race of technology! Which was equal to an undying.

If it were detected by the ship made by the backward Blood River continent, that would be a joke.

……

Within the Dark purple ship.

“Yuke, that Baqi sure is arrogant. I painstakingly went all the way there, yet he didn’t even smile at me.” The fox like youth Kuyan sat crossed legged, lifting a wine glass and saying dissatisfied.

“Baqi was also known as blood god, he made his name because of his madness and slaughter. He may be closer to his blood god guards. However to others, he’s always been cold.” The white robed Yuke shook his head and smiled. “There is no way around it. Baqi is a genius of a trillion years, hence he can back his arrogance. We can only accept it!”

The fox like youth simply snorted coldly.

In front of Baqi earlier, he was affectionate and friendly. However, now he couldn’t hide it anymore.

“Kuyan.” The white robed Yuke changed the subject, “You giving this beast god statue to the undying shrine this time will get you a huge reward.”

“Haha…”The fox like youth smiled the moment he thought of the reward.

……

“6…5…4…3…2…1!” Energy storing complete!”

Within the silver white pyramid’s control room, Black clothed Luo Feng sat in the sofa. His eyes gleamed coldly as he ordered, “Fire!”

……

The silver white pyramid was 1,200m tall.

The large pyramid at this time revealed itself. The beautiful tip of the pyramid had a condensed glaring light ball as the entire surface of the ship had large amounts of light energy gathered at the tip. It got stronger and stronger, until it sparked like lightning, finally forming a light ball with a diameter of 300m.

With the order within the control room, “Fire!”

Chi!

The light ball at the tip became a light pillar with a diameter of 300m and immediately followed the calculated path from the AI within the ship and fired out!

……

Within the dark purple ship.

The fox like youth was still smiling, “Yuke, you relax, this…”

chi!

The 300m diameter light pillar immediately passed right through the purple ship, that ship’s diameter was but about 100m, it was completely engulfed by the light pillar. Under this terrifying attack, the two sector lords within the ship Kuyan and Yuke could only stare wide eyed in fear and were reduced to nothing.

The other 8 envoys within didn’t even have time to react and were destroyed!

Peng!

The space rings all broke apart one by one, and all the stored spaces within too were sliced open, with large amounts of items within being reduced to dust. However, within the fox like Kuyan’s ring, there were several items that managed to survive the light pillar’s attack. Especially that beast god statue…

Even after the space was destroyed, it was perfectly undamaged, almost like this attack was nothing but a gust of wind against it.

The light pillar immediately reduced the ship to dust. Simultaneously, a 300m diameter cavity appeared in the wilderness of the ancient god ruins below. The light pillar condensed and gathered and finally a huge explosion occurred! Rumble…tens of thousands of km around exploded. The area at the middle of the explosion was decimated, and countless rubble and stones flew everywhere.

Star annihilator cannon!

The truth that just one shot could destroy an entire planet, was not a joke at all.

……

At the depths of the huge pit, within the palace.

“Such a strong energy ripple?”

“Who is it?”

Sou! Sou!

Two silhouettes, one blood god Baqi and another Qi Niu swiftly rushed towards the energy ripple. Even the two captains of the blood god guards swiftly rose into the skies. All these characters flew out of the huge pit and headed towards the terrifying energy ripples.

“What’s going on?”

“Why has the lord left?”

The blood god guards all rose into the skies and flew out of the huge pit. Luo Feng too followed suit.

“Baqi, blood god guards.” Luo Feng looked at the guards swiftly flying out, thinking, “It’s time to say goodbye!”

Sou!

As Blood god Baqi rushed towards the energy ripples, Luo Feng rushed into the skies and simultaneously took off his wrist communicator, tossing the hard to destroy communicator deep into the pit. He himself swiftly flew through the 18 cloud levels and as the automaton ship drew close, he vanished into his internal world.

……

A huge crater with a diameter of tens of thousands of km could be seen.

Blood god Baqi and Qi Niu floated in mid air, gazing down at the size of the crater, and were utterly shocked.

“There’s no trace of origin law ripples.” Blood god Baqi’s face revealed shock. “This, this isn’t an undying’s attack”

“It’s the outsiders!” Qi Niu’s eyes too were filled with shock.

“Inform the shrine, immediately inform the shrine!”

……

And in the space above Blood River world, the automaton ship disguised as a meteorite flew.

Luo Feng lay in the sofa, lifting a wine glass and looked at the beast god statue that emitted a terrifying energy. He smiled happily and said, “1/3 of the energy reserves were used to exchange for a beast god statue. It’s definitely worth it. With such a small capital investment, I’ve gotten a huge profit, huge profit indeed!”
