Chapter 1404: A Helping Hand from the Generals

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“This is a major crisis that could exterminate all races within the Universe Ocean and bring the human race to its end!” Primal Chaos City Leader told Luo Feng after watching the three ancestral gods disappear. “It may be important to help Teacher Origin regain his freedom, but compared to this major crisis, Teacher Origin’s situation seems mild. You must never, ever be influenced.”

“Also!” he added. “Now, you are merely a universe master, but your combat power is already quite powerful.” His brows furrowed as he frowned. “Once you become a true god, your power will definitely increase by a few more levels. By then, it will be much easier for you to deal with the Sector Beast, you will also be more confident! And now, the willpower of the primal universe origin is guiding you, encouraging you to go to war. Is it truly because… it earnestly wanted the Sector Beast dead? Or because it wanted to borrow the efforts of the Sector Beast to kill and destroy you? After all, other than Huge Axe, none of us really exchanged blows with a Sector Beast before. Known to be the existence that represents destruction, its attack methods should be absolutely terrorizing.

“Even if you have multiple bodies, if your soul is exterminated, then the various other bodies would perish altogether. If the willpower of the primal universe origin truly wants you to kill the Sector Beast, then you have no cause for worry. But if it intended to borrow aid from the Sector Beast to kill you, then you need to exercise extreme vigilance.

“This is where you can never let your guard down. After all, for countless years, even if the Sector Beast was truly unstoppable, at the very most, the primal universe would self-destruct and transform back into the origin; when the worst was over, it could still evolve back into the primal universe. The power of the primal universe… For anyone to truly be able to destroy it from the fundamental level, it is simply unheard of. If that was so, then why would it want to kill the Sector Beast? Is it for real? Or is everything merely part of a larger plot?”

Luo Feng nodded repeatedly as he listened. It was true. A Sector Beast represented destruction, but the primal universe represented life. A Sector Beast would take an extremely long time to be born, but the primal universe was continuously undergoing destruction and rebirth. In fact, it had never truly been destroyed before. This was because even a Sector Beast had never been truly able to destroy the primal universe.

“I understand,” said Luo Feng, nodding solemnly.

“After all, Teacher Origin is already suppressed,” Primal Chaos City Leader lamented. “If even you are being led to annihilation by the willpower of that origin, no matter how confident I am, I am still very much aware that in certain aspects, I will never be as good as you and Teacher Origin.”

Luo Feng did not rush his way to the Land of Darkness. After all, according to what the willpower of the origin had openly said, it had to be destroyed before this reincarnation era.

What a lengthy unit of time a reincarnation era was; after all, Luo Feng had not even lived past ten million years. Compared to a reincarnation era, that was such a short period that it carried little significance. This was why Luo Feng had more than ample time to prepare.

At the same time, Luo Feng was also preparing for the upcoming “Big Sweep.”

******

Another couple of days passed.

In the Milky Way Galaxy, within the Milky Way Holy Land, Remote Ocean Luo Feng sat in the nine-story tower floating before his eyes. Earlier, he had completed the comprehension of the third stage of Shi Wu Wings. But, following the increase in the level of secret technique, even Luo Feng—who was on Star Tower—could roughly comprehend how much more profound the secret techniques were at the higher levels. He would likely stay here to study and comprehend. Luo Feng also hoped that, through his understanding and his grasp of the various other secret techniques, he could also boost his progress on the godly body path.

On the godly body path, all comprehension of life genes had, in fact, something common to the secret techniques, the Rhinoceros Emperor Game, and several others. They all had some degree of connection to one another.

“Teacher?” Remote Ocean Luo Feng suddenly stopped what he was doing. With a flip of his hand, he retrieved a communication token.

“Luo Feng.” There was incoming news, and it was sent by Sitting Mountain Guest.

Immediately, Remote Ocean Luo Feng grew serious. Ever since the fourth most dangerous land had emerged, Teacher Sitting Mountain Guest seemed to have disappeared and did not seem bothered about any of these anymore.

“Teacher,” Luo Feng responded.

“Those three ancestral gods must have already looked you up,” Sitting Mountain Guest said.

Luo Feng was taken aback, but still, he replied, “Yes.”

“Humph. Other than you, there is no one else they can look for,” Sitting Mountain Guest replied. “But you have to bear this in mind. Do not hasten into going over to the Land of Darkness. After all, that place is the nest of the Sector Beasts. There will be many Sector Beasts inside… If you are ready and have decided on when to go over to deal with them, come look for me before you go.”

Luo Feng was filled with uncertainty. “Teacher, over to your place?”

“You just need to remember to do so!” Sitting Mountain Guest cut off the communication line curtly.

Luo Feng was dumbfounded. “What is going on?” He frowned as he tried to make sense of his doubts.

Previously, Teacher Sitting Mountain Guest was usually considered someone with an even temper. He had always been very concerned about Luo Feng, too. But since the emergence of the fourth most dangerous land, Sitting Mountain Guest had changed. Even in the midst of such massive events, he had not bothered looking for Luo Feng at all. This time around, Teacher Sitting Mountain Guest made a sudden call to Luo Feng, and although it was merely a curt conversation with a single instruction, Luo Feng could feel that Teacher was, most likely, still deeply concerned about him.

“There seem to be some changes in Teacher’s temperament…” Luo Feng whispered. “Could it be due to the World of Jin? The Nine Volume Manual! It is a set of lost knowledge of the Jin Dynasty that was not supposed to be imparted to outsiders. Star Tower is a true treasure that was most likely created by a true god. I had my suspicions earlier on that Teacher was related to the Jin Dynasty. Plus, Teacher has ordered me to look for him before I go ahead to deal with the Sector Beasts…”

Luo Feng’s brows furrowed as he sank deep into thought. He was no fool. Of course he could feel how mysterious Teacher was being, and he felt that the secret that Sitting Mountain Guest was keeping would be quite a big deal.

******

Luo Feng cast everything aside. The most important thing that he had to prepare for at the moment was… the Big Sweep!

In a blink of the eye, one year had passed. In the World of Jin, at the military camp of East Army, at the base camp of Python River Army, Luo Feng was in the hall of his stone house.

“Ring of military point…” Luo Feng wore the ring of the military point on his wrist. Activating his godly power, there was a sudden change in the surrounding time and space, and a figure bathed in golden light appeared out of nowhere.

“Lord Milky Way,” the figure bathed in golden light greeted.

“Show me simulations of all the law masters and true gods who passed the selections for the four major armies that I have investigated on so far,” Luo Feng commanded.

Within the year, he had carried out as many as six rounds of investigations to ensure that he was constantly kept abreast of the overall number and any information about the great beings from the united forces alliance and Purple Moon Holy Land that had entered the World of Jin.

“Yes,” the figure with golden light responded with reverence.

Hua!

Within the vast surroundings of the space originally only occupied by Luo Feng and the figure bathed in golden light. Numerous figures were rapidly appearing. These figures followed a very systematic way of queuing up. They all stood unmoving on the same spots, looking like fools while exuding their life auras. In the world of military arms, it was relatively easy to simulate life auras.

“Hmm…” Luo Feng looked around while carefully sensing with his godly power.

The basic appearances of certain universe masters remained the same. After all, the natives of the World of Jin had not seen them before, so whether or not their appearances were different did not matter much to them. This was why, by just searching with his naked eye, he could already discover a few targets.

“Keep these 61 and clear away the rest,” Luo Feng ordered while speedily using his godly power to lock down 61 universe masters amidst the crowd.

“Yes,” the figure bathed in golden light replied in reverence.

Suddenly, a large number of warrior figures started vanishing one by one, leaving behind 61 warriors who were law masters.

“Show me the list that recorded the time they entered the army,” Luo Feng ordered. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had just given his order when, instantly, above these 61 law masters, their accurate times of entry into the respective armies appeared in order of precedence.

“These 61 law masters arrived in batches.” Luo Feng looked and nodded his head in silence. “In total, they were divided into five batches, and the final batch entered two months ago. So, from two months ago until now, there isn’t a single one that entered the army…”

Based on what he had investigated over the course of the past year, during the first month of the third era, he had only set the average number of soldiers joining the army at twelve. From the second to eighth month, an outbreak was considered to have occurred. The number of soldiers joining the army was at its peak.

With the passage of time, at the later stage, the number was obviously reduced. Then, in the final two months, there was no longer anyone joining the army.

“Hmm. I suppose the numbers of universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land and the united forces alliance are almost reaching their limits,” Luo Feng said to himself. “Throughout the year, Purple Moon Holy Land had a total of 110 universe masters joining the army. On the other hand, the united forces camp sent 166 law masters. This can be considered one batch. In total, Purple Moon Holy Land must have a total of 205 warriors still alive! And the united forces camp must have a total of 238!”

Luo Feng nodded as he thought it over.

“I suppose the majority of universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land have charged their way in, and it is likewise for the united forces alliance, where as many as half of its forces may have barged their way here.”

It was undeniable that the two groups of powers attached great importance to this. Or, rather, every universe master harbored an intense yearning. If the number that was eliminated during the selections was also taken into consideration, then the number of universe master who came in was evidently much, much higher.

“Judging from the number of warriors, it’s quite obvious that the number being disqualified during the selections is not big.” Luo Feng nodded discreetly. “Seems like, during selections for the universe masters from my Universe Ocean, their death rates were much lower than those of the natives of the World of Jin.”

Luo Feng speculated that the various powerful groups would act in batches. Every batch would most likely bring along some treasures, and there might even be supreme true treasures among these treasures.

After all, some of the universe masters from the various groups who entered the World of Jin during the first and second eras had carried out exchanges with their races’ supreme true treasures at military points to ensure that they had maximized their benefits. It went without saying that many of the supreme true treasures within Universe Ocean were treasures at the level of true gods of void space. Even for those that at true god level, some of these were very unique.

By seizing the World of Jin, he would be able to exchange quite a fair number of treasures of a true god level.

“It’s time for action.” Luo Feng took in a deep breath as a glimmer of murderous intent flashed momentarily in his eyes. “The four generals.”

Luo Feng established direct contact with the four generals of the four major armies through the world of military arms. Merely a short moment later, four simulated figures appeared not far from Luo Feng.

“Milky Way.”

“Milky Way, why have you summoned us? That’s quite rare.”

Harmonious Snow and the other three generals had already acknowledged Luo Feng as the heir of Godly King, as they were aware that Luo Feng could make use of the strength of the World of Jin. They were also aware that His Majesty the Godly King greatly favored Luo Feng, so the moment he summoned them, they would naturally turn up without further ado.

“I want to kill a batch of law masters,” Luo Feng said in a straightforward manner.

The four generals were flustered.

“Kill a batch?”

“Kill how many? How many millions?”

The four generals were very worried, as they were reluctant to kill too many warriors so brutally. Such an event would bring about chaos.

Luo Feng laughed. “Fret not. Not even 500 of them.”

“Not more than five hundred!” The four generals could now laugh along with him.

Such an insignificant number of law masters! It would be equivalent to a normal fight within a random tribe, where the number of law masters who died was unknown. Fewer than 500—this was not substantial enough to trouble them into rendering their service.

“The reason why I am requesting that you four generals lend me a helping hand is because all these warriors, close to 500 of them in total, are scattered among the four armies,” Luo Feng explained. “My plan is to attack and kill them all in one move, and… my requirement is that these must be soul attacks. They are scattered all over the four military camps. Killing them all in one go is very difficult, so I can only consider it if I enlist the help of all four generals. If you all could execute your miniature universes together to enshroud the entire military camp, I would be able to eliminate all those souls directly in one go, and none shall survive.”
