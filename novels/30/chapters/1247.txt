Chapter 1248: Preaching

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Primal Chaos City Leader and Huge Axe Creator were very clear of the kind of person Luo Feng was, as they had watched him grow and mature. Just like how he had been absorbed into the Universe Virtual Network Company at the very beginning, it had always been the same way with Luo Feng. When there was no outburst, all was peaceful; the moment he had an outburst, it would certainly result in an amazing surprise.

Since he had first become Primal Chaos City Leader’s disciple, he had lain low and completely effaced himself, and he had kept to such obscurity that the outside world started speculating whether he was alive or dead.

Through his journey of growth, his character and style of handling matters were clearly observed by both Primal Chaos City Leader and Huge Axe Creator. They were very clear on the fact that Luo Feng would only start on something if he was prepared for it and that he had the confidence to bring it to completion. If he was not prepared or lacked the confidence, he would never casually commit to it. On the contrary, if he verbalized his decisions in a resolute and confident manner… then he was bound to succeed!

“Everything is within your heart?” Huge Axe Creator gave a hearty laugh. “Everything? What great confidence you have! But just listening to your words makes me very happy.”

“From an undying to the limit of a universe supreme master.” Primal Chaos City Leader could not hold back his question: “So, do you know how you should break through a reincarnation era?”

Huge Axe Creator, who was listening by the side, also looked at Luo Feng.

Breaking through a reincarnation… even Huge Axe felt the fear and sense of loss. Even he was not confident.

Luo Feng was slightly taken aback. Breaking through a reincarnation? He was truly clueless.

With a serious expression, Luo Feng said, “The inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River is extremely vast. However, I am under the influence of the willpower of the primal universe, so I am only allowed to access information about the inheritance up to the limit of a universe supreme master! Any further than this—I will need to break through a reincarnation era to break free from the influence of the willpower of the primal universe.”

“Willpower of the origin?”

Huge Axe and Primal Chaos City Leader looked at one another. Others might have been unaware, but previously, the two of them were most frequently in contact with Teacher Origin; after Teacher Origin was suppressed, whenever he needed to connect with the human race, it was mostly through the two of them. This was why they had the opportunity to hear about the willpower of the origin from Teacher Origin.

Hua!

There were many stone chairs on either side of the long stone table. Luo Feng, Huge Axe, and Primal Chaos City Leader were seated there when suddenly, on the stone chair opposite Huge Axe’s—which had been empty all this while—a white-robed figure appeared. It was Teacher Origin, but all three of them, Luo Feng, Huge Axe and Primal Chaos City Leader, did not realize this.

“Willpower of the origin?” To the side, white-robed Teacher Origin frowned as he listened.

“But how a universe supreme master continues to cultivate, and how to reach the limit of a universe supreme master—these, I do know,” Luo Feng said. “With this limit as the basis, if I were to achieve a breakthrough and reach a new level—”

“If you reach a new level, then you will certainly be able to break through a reincarnation,” Huge Axe Creator said, finishing his sentence.

“Ah!” Luo Feng was shocked and looked toward Huge Axe Creator. He could only speculate, after all, regarding reincarnation. There was no information to be found within the inheritance at all, and it was also impossible to find any information past the limit of a universe supreme master. He had not expected Huge Axe to say this so confidently. Primal Chaos City Leader also looked towards Huge Axe with a shocked expression.

Huge Axe looked at Luo Feng and Primal Chaos City Leader and said, “It’s very simple. When you all achieve your breakthroughs to become universe supreme masters, you will understand why I know this. The bottom-line: For a complete breakthrough to the level of a universe supreme master—to level up—you must make it past a reincarnation. If you can’t reach the next level, then take a gamble and try your luck. There is still a possibility of achieving a breakthrough. As for how high your chances are? Take a look at the countless universe supreme masters who have been annihilated for umpteen reincarnation eras, and you will know how low your chances are.”

“True.” Luo Feng and Primal Chaos City Leader nodded their heads.

For countless reincarnation eras—at least ten million reincarnation eras—every one of them had at least dozens of universe supreme masters. Sailing down the long river of time, exactly how many universe supreme masters from Universe Ocean were annihilated, was a number that was hard to tell.

But the ones who succeeded were easy to track: Purple Moon Ancestor and East Emperor Ancestor. Just the two of them!

As for whether these two ancestors managed to break through and surpass the level of a universe supreme master in order to successfully break their way through a reincarnation, or if they simply took a gamble within their limit of a universe supreme master to barely scrape through and succeed… no one knew.

“How can a universe master become a universe supreme master?” Primal Chaos City Leader asked persistently. This concerned him personally.

Huge Axe also pressed for answers. “For a breakthrough, every universe master must tread a different path. Did the inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River provide any guidance?”

“Yes!” Luo Feng said with a nod. “In that ancient civilization, there are countless great beings. Because there were many who managed to achieve breakthroughs, to become a universe supreme master, one has to make it past an extremely large threshold. Naturally, there was a systematic way of recognition, and also, various experiences to tap from, which can help you maximize the chances of successful breakthroughs. By the end of this reincarnation era, our human race may have four to five universe supreme masters. But if there is more guidance—this number may multiply many folds.”

Previously, Divine Eye Clan had seen the emergence of seven universe supreme masters! The human race only had two up until today (whereby one of them, Teacher Origin, was being suppressed). As a result, being able to see the birth of four to five universe supreme masters would already be considered great news.

“Multiply many folds?” Huge Axe and Primal Chaos City Leader were both shocked.

“Doesn’t it mean that almost every universe master will become a universe supreme master?” Primal Chaos City Leader asked. The human race only had a total of 19 universe masters.

“No.” Luo Feng shook his head. “That’s not what I meant. From a universe master to a universe supreme master, there is an extremely frightening threshold to pass. With the guidance of the ancient civilization, although the chances of breaking through are maximized, there is still a high level of difficulty. What I was referring to was the entire cultivation system. That is, from an undying—to a universe supreme master. For instance, the human race currently only has a few thousand universe knights and close to 20 universe masters. Under a more improved system, the human race could possibly have over 100,000 universe knights and a few hundred universe masters! Such a cultivation method enables those who are naturally less talented and who may otherwise only reach the level of a universe knight to progress all the way to becoming a universe master.

“This explains why the average talent of these few hundred universe masters cannot even be compared with as few as about 20 universe masters of our human race. I suppose a few hundred universe masters should be able to give rise to dozens of universe supreme masters. If they are lucky, it may also be possible to reach a number close to 100 universe supreme masters.”

Silence.

Primal Chaos City Leader and Huge Axe Creator had quietened down. They were in the aftermath of a shock. So powerful! How many universe supreme masters could one reincarnation era cultivate? Take the first reincarnation era and the second reincarnation era, for instance. Both eras only had around 30 universe supreme masters.

In the near future, could the human race become stronger than a reincarnation era?

“This…” Primal Chaos City Leader opened his mouth to speak but was at a loss for words. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Are you confident?” Huge Axe’s eyes were, on the contrary, glimmering.

Luo Feng nodded, “Of course! A universe supreme master is merely one of the many stages along the path that a great being takes. As our human race gets stronger, and the more territories we claim in the primal universe, our numbers will increase. Close to 100 universe supreme masters will also be highly possible for us.”

“Great,” Huge Axe replied right away. “Then you shall provide us with some guidance and let us see just how impressive this ancient civilization could be.”

“Sure.” Luo Feng was well-prepared. Naturally, he would be confident.

Huge Axe nodded. “I shall arrange for the few of them to make their way here.”

******

On this piece of land suspended in the vast void space was Huge Axe’s godly palace. Before it was a long stone table with stone chairs on either side. There, several figures were starting to appear.

“Huge Axe Creator, why are you looking for us so urgently?” Peng Gong Master asked amidst smiles.

At the same time, other universe masters were appearing one by one. They were Darkness Master, Void Gold Master, Qing Dong Master, Deserted Mirror Master, Peng Gong Master, Long Yan Master, and Ice Mountain Master. Including Primal Chaos City Leader, there was a total of eight universe masters.

The moment they arrived, the first thing they would notice was that Luo Feng was present, too. Instantly, all of them could feel their insides burning as anticipation settled in. They all knew that Luo Feng was receiving the inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River from that ancient civilization. For him to show up this time around, it seemed like the matter concerned that inheritance.

“Luo Feng has started to receive the inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River,” Huge Axe said. His eyes swept across the universe masters once before he fixed his gaze on them. “Primal Chaos, Darkness, Peng Gong. The three of you are the most hopeful ones for becoming universe supreme masters. Void Gold, Long Yan, Deserted Mirror, Qing Dong, and Ice Mountain. The five of you are quite hopeful candidates, too. You all should join us in listening… Let us listen to what Luo Feng can tell us—the universe masters—about achieving our breakthrough to become universe supreme masters!”

Hua!

Primal Chaos City Leader appeared to be quite at peace. He merely smiled, but the other seven were shocked and their emotions ran high. A breakthrough from universe master to universe supreme master? There was simply no precedent to follow, as each and every universe master had to walk a different path. This was already giving them headaches because if they wanted to attempt a breakthrough, it had to be done within and during the time of their current primal universe era. This meant that, once this reincarnation era ended and they had to go into the miniature universe, they would no longer have the chance to try again. How can they not panic?

Qing Dong Master was the first to speak up. “Luo Feng, are you confident?”

“Milky Way, can I become a universe supreme master?” Peng Gong Master was more straightforward and asked directly.

Luo Feng addressed their concerns right away. “For the few of you here… Our human race is very gifted. Even without any system to guide us, we have made it up to now with each and every one of you being so extraordinary. The moment we have the ancient civilization’s guidance, certainly there is hope for the few of you here to become universe supreme masters of our human race. As for who can achieve the breakthrough, this I cannot guarantee. I just know that… after listening to what I have to say, you all will foster a better understanding.”

“All of you shall stop asking now,” Huge Axe ordered. “Just let Luo Feng speak.”

The many universe masters who had yearned for such a breakthrough for endless time all sat there, desperately holding back their doubts and questions, suppressing their worries and anxieties as they fixated their gazes on Luo Feng. They started to pay close attention to what he had to say. White-robed Teacher Origin listened intently.

Luo Feng’s gaze swept through everyone present. “From universe master to universe supreme master! Everyone must tread a different path, which, in fact, could be classified into two major categories!”

Everyone held their breath and listened carefully.

“The first category: starting off by godly power!” Luo Feng said with utmost confidence. “The second category: starting off by laws!”

Huge Axe Creator, who was paying close attention, was instantly filled with doubts. He asked, “Starting off by laws… This process of becoming a universe supreme master—from what I know, everyone has to advance from the laws, like the universe master from Space Beast Alliance combined the laws of the Eight Beast Gods! Many others mainly started off from time and space. All of them had different directions.”

Luo Feng smiled. “Starting off from the laws, almost 90 percent of the universe supreme masters did as such,” he explained. “As for starting off with godly power… What is godly power? Godly power gives rise to form—that is, the body! Godly power contains life imprints, thus constituting the core of life! Just like how we humans have souls, while some other races do not but still have the core of life. In short, any universe master can convert into endless godly power!”

Everyone listened in silence.

“What is the foundation of becoming a universe supreme master? To break! To break limits! To break free from suppression! Breaking free from all kinds of shackles would allow us to enter a whole new world!”

Luo Feng paused, then said solemnly, “Just like how we start off with the laws, we have to achieve our breakthrough via the laws to enable God Country to break through the bottleneck. And once God Country passes the bottleneck, it will naturally start to evolve and transform into a miniature universe.

“On the other hand, to start off by godly power, the perfect life gene of a universe master is 10,081 times! This is the limit. Starting off by godly power requires one to surpass this limit! To enable one’s godly power to evolve into a whole new level! Once our godly power has evolved, the body and soul would follow suit. This is what it means to use force against technique! We are utilizing our absolute power to overcome and break free from the shackles! Once we achieve our own breakthrough, the capacity to bear the weight of God Country would naturally increase. That is when we can propel God Country to break through its bottleneck and start its evolution into a miniature universe.”

All the universe masters present there were now listening wordlessly.

The various races within Universe Ocean all seemed to be blindly crossing the river together, with no concrete direction or aim to advance into. Because of the small numbers, it was impossible to establish a systematic way of study. And there was no one, like a super great being, to take leadership for strategizing or for organizing to ensure conformity and integration of members.

“Break free from the shackles!” Luo Feng said. “Then we can control our fate. From there, the laws will have to retreat, and the tables will be turned. We will dictate while the laws follow! Starting off with godly power is extremely difficult, while starting off with laws is relatively easier. I would suggest starting off with the laws, then moving on to figure out how and what we should do.”
