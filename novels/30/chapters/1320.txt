Chapter 1323: Happy Surprise

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Contrary to what Luo Feng thought, none of the human universe masters were afraid. All of them were ambitious and aggressive, and they didn’t give a damn about the killing order of Purple Moon Holy Land. First of all, the inheritance from the ancient civilization made the humans more confident. Also, they had just defeated the entire united forces alliance, so Purple Moon Holy Land was nothing to them. Besides, the main battlefield would be in the original universe in the future, and few would go to Universe Ocean. Even though Darkness Master and Primal Chaos City Leader went there sometimes, they only sent their bodies.

For what it was worth, Purple Moon Holy Land could only make threats in Universe Ocean. They were not a real threat! Even if there was trouble, it would be a learning experience for the humans.

The meeting among seniors was quickly finished, and the beings disappeared from the thrones. Primal Chaos City Leader and Luo Feng were the only two left.

Primal Chaos City Leader glanced at Luo Feng with a smile. “Are you still worried?”

“Not anymore.” Luo Feng shook his head and smiled.

“You shouldn’t have been,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “You made a huge contribution during the fight between us and the united forces alliance. All the universe masters respect you wholeheartedly! You’ve helped our race a lot, and you’re influential. You are certainly a leader. As long as you don’t do stupid things—like making enemies everywhere—the race will stand by your side no matter what. After all, everyone makes enemies in Universe Ocean. Beings will try to kill you even if you mean them no harm. It’s okay to make enemies.”

Luo Feng nodded. It was true. The Thunderstorm Star race was very weak, so he didn’t need to worry about it. Purple Moon Holy Land was powerful, yet the humans could also withstand them. Of course, if Luo Feng made enemies everywhere and led all the powers to attack humans, the humans would be upset. No matter how confident a race was, it didn’t dare to make itself an enemy to all powers. If the humans lost the battle against the united forces and retreated back to the primal universe, the other races might hit them while they were down; all the powers in both the original universe and Universe Ocean would unite and suppress them. That would be a most miserable situation. Fortunately, that hadn’t happened.

“Teacher.” Luo Feng recalled the information he had acquired before and asked, “Is there a universe master called ‘Pei Xing Master’ among those new universe masters?”

“Yes.” Primal Chaos City Leader looked at Luo Feng.

“His wing true treasure…” Luo Feng frowned. “Can we have some more detailed information about him?”

“Wing true treasure?” Primal Chaos City Leader glanced at Luo Feng and looked pleased. “Is his wing somehow connected to your silver wing?” He only gave Luo Feng one pair of Shi Wu Wings, and Luo Feng had found another pair. After absorbing lots of blade energies, it was only under a supreme true treasure now.

Luo Feng nodded. “It’s only an assumption.”

“Okay, I’ll help you check now.” Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “There are around 400 universe masters in the Hong Alliance now, and the intelligence network is enormous. It should be easy to find. I’ll tell you immediately after I get the information.”

“Okay.” Luo Feng nodded.

Every universe master had a group of friends who would send messages to each other. There were around 400 universe masters in the Hong Alliance, and everyone had many friends—even friends in Universe Ocean. It was definitely a giant intelligence network. The larger the network, the more detailed the information would be. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After the killing order from Purple Moon Holy Land spread, all the powers in Universe Ocean sighed.

“Luo Feng is crazy. Does he really think he can fight Purple Moon Holy Land? It’s a holy land! No matter how mad the fight is, and even if a group of universe masters die, they can recover after a few universe eras! Even if they’re defeated by the humans, they can hide in Purple Moon Holy Land for a universe era or two.”

“That’s right. The humans need to seize the time to breed more universe supreme masters. For the great beings from Purple Moon Holy Land, they can just return to Purple Moon Holy Land, but the humans can’t do the same thing.”

All the powers sighed. They all thought the humans were bringing trouble on themselves by fighting a holy land.

Tilted Peak Sector.

There was a three-level tower, and each level was dodecagon. The strange tower kept going inside Tilted Peak Sector.

“An order from the ancestor?” Pei Xing Master looked to the outside of Tilted Peak Sector and whispered, “Ancestor thinks too highly of that Luo Feng. He’s only one man, yet we all need to avoid him? Especially those who venture into Universe Boat? Fortunately, I’m in Tilted Peak Sector, so I don’t need to care about him… Luo Feng? Just wait and see. I’ve been staying in the holy land and have never come out. Now that I’m in Universe Ocean, I might have such luck in the future, and I can surpass Luo Feng.”

Of course Pei Xing Master was jealous of Luo Feng. After all, he had never been in Universe Ocean before. How could he not be jealous? He had never had the chance.

“I must look for the opportunity carefully.” Pei Xing Master kept searching in the inner area of Tilted Peak Sector.

******

The strategy of Purple Moon Holy Land against the humans was to avoid Luo Feng, who was a terrifying handful. They only targeted other human universe masters. Now that Luo Feng was in Universe Boat, the universe masters around him all avoided him, even if they had something important to do.

The great beings from Purple Moon Holy Land in Universe Ocean were all intimidated, whereas those in Tilted Peak Sector and Flowing Level Mountain were just as relaxed as before.

******

Only half a month after the senior meeting in the human race, Primal Chaos City Leader summoned Luo Feng and notified him that there was some new information.

“Teacher,” Luo Feng said. He had high expectations.

“A universe master within the Hong Alliance has many friends, and he’s friends with two universe masters from Eastern Emperor Holy Land,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “After talking with him, we know that the true treasure wing Pei Xing Master has appeared in the original universe more than ten universe eras ago. It was used by a universe master from other universe eras. However, he was killed by a great being from Purple Moon Holy Land, and the wing true treasure was seized. It didn’t show up in Universe Ocean until recently.”

Now, Luo Feng understood. More than ten universe eras ago… No wonder there wasn’t any detailed information about it from the other three universe eras. Only the two holy lands would know more about such ancient information.

“That true treasure wing was called ‘Five-Color Cloud Wing’ before,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “It’s one of the best top-tier true treasure spiritual weapons. Firstly, it can change directions and accelerate its speed very fast. Secondly, it has binding power. The binding power performed before can’t compare to that which Pei Xing Master performed. Apparently, Pei Xing Master performed a supreme technique using Five-Color Cloud Wing.”

Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed. One of the best top-tier true treasure spiritual weapons? That sounded familiar.

His Shi Wu Wing was one of the best top-tier true treasure spiritual weapons before the origin was recovered, and after it was recovered, it was one of the best pinnacle true treasures, second only to supreme true treasures. And it helped with flying?

“Another piece of information” Primal Chaos City Leader smiled and added, “Five-Color Cloud Wing stood for silver four wings during that universe era.”

Luo Feng was shocked. It was easy to change the color of a true treasure. However, the Five-Color Cloud Wing had been silver during that universe era, so silver might have been its natural color.

“That’s the information,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “You can decide what you want to do about it.”

Luo Feng smirked. “I’ll seize the chance, certainly.”

******

On a reef at the center of Whirling Swamp Ocean in the inner area of Universe Ocean.

Nobody in Universe Ocean knew that Luo Feng was in Whirling Swamp Ocean. As for Great Thunder Star Master? Even if everyone knew about their feud, nobody dared to meddle. Everyone knew that Luo Feng was incredibly powerful, so if someone actually messed with him, he would treat them as he treated those from Purple Moon Holy Land.

Luo Feng didn’t kill and made enemies recklessly. If someone messed with him and brought trouble upon themselves, no powers in Universe Ocean would interfere.

“Great beings find that Great Thunder Star Master has appeared in Universe Boat.”

“He was spotted twice, and he’s racing here. He’ll arrive very soon.”

“It’s going to be incredible. The furious Great Thunder Star Master and Milky Way Horde Leader, who has the inheritance from Duan Dong River. What’s the fighting going to be like?”

15 universe masters had already gathered on the reef, including a level-six universe master from the Eastern Emperor Holy Land.

Inside Star Tower, Luo Feng was looking down. He could hear those who were talking outside.

“Great Thunder Star Master,” Luo Feng whispered.

He had already learned about the traces of Great Thunder Star Master from the Hong Alliance’s intelligence network. He reckoned that it would take Great Thunder Star Master around a month to arrive here.

Great Thunder Star Master, I’ll use you to test the two techniques of my Star Tower, Luo Feng thought.

Blood Shadow Blade was at top-tier level seven, and with Duan Mie, it was at top-tier level eight.

Star Tower was even more incredible. The fifth level of engravings on Star Tower was at level eight, and with Duan Mie, it was at level nine! Even the most powerful universe supreme masters in Universe Ocean could only wield power at top-tier level nine. Most of them were at level eight, while some of them were at level seven.

With Duan Mie, Blood Shadow Blade, and Star Tower, Luo Feng could stand among the top universe supreme masters. Only a few could surpass him. Of course, one of his weaknesses was that he couldn’t break the rules! No matter how powerful a universe master was, he still had to follow certain rules, like the speed limit… This was Luo Feng’s weakness.

Even though Luo Feng was absolutely confident, other powers in Universe Ocean still found it foolish that he dared to provoke Great Thunder Star Master. Besides, humans still needed to deal with the more powerful Purple Moon Holy Land and those from the original universe. They all thought that Luo Feng was too crazy.

“Huh?”

Luo Feng frowned in Star Tower as an important email was sent to him through the virtual universe. Luo Feng clicked on the email.

Suddenly, he stood up and looked exhilarated. “Teacher…! He became a universe supreme master?”
