Chapter 1329: “It”

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The time and space of the primal secret region—the power center of the human race—were already transformed. Under the control of the new true god, Primal Chaos City Leader, even the laws were already changed. At least the enemies couldn’t get to the center in a short time through god country transportation or teleportation.

After Huge Axe died, the humans had much weaker control over space and time, which was why the united forces alliance had been able to reach their center in a short period of time.

Hua! Hua! Hua!

Waves appeared in the endless Remote Ocean standing in the space. A being showed up on the waves.

“I’m back.”

Luo Feng stepped on the waves, and the godly power immediately supplied his original body. The godly power also went into Boat of Mausoleum and supplied the golden horned beast. Both bodies recovered instantly. To the endless Remote Ocean, such godly power was nothing.

“The godly power path is indeed complicated and mysterious.” Luo Feng waved his hands, and a world ring flew out. The endless waves tumbled and swallowed the world ring.

Lots of special materials gained from Universe Boat by Luo Feng in the past 800 years were hidden in that world ring. There were 92,083 kinds of rock material, as well as flames, gases, liquids, metals, and so on. Other than those lifeless objects, pieces of the dead body of Thunder Shuttle Master and Great Thunder Star Master were also in the world ring.

There were many routes on the godly power path. Endless Remote Ocean had the inherited technique Creation, which could analyze life genes and create life forms! Naturally, analyzing life genes was the most effective. Before he had gone to Universe Ocean the last time, Luo Feng had put many objects from the original universe in Remote Ocean for it to analyze.

Luo Feng had a simple method. Endless Remote Ocean could analyze the life forms! His godly power then stayed in the space of inheritance to further study them. Once he had made some breakthrough during the studies, he would use his endless Remote Ocean for testing again.

“Unfortunately, the creatures I prepared last time are already rotten.” Luo Feng shook his head. Some creatures only have a lifespan of around 1,000 years, so they had already aged to death during the course of study.

“Teacher!” Luo Feng shouted on the waves of endless Remote Ocean.

Shua!

A being showed up beside Luo Feng. It was Primal Chaos City Leader. He wore a golden cape, and his eyes looked as if they had recorded the birth and death of a universe. He appeared very calm, which amazed Luo Feng, as his teacher and Huge Axe had two different auras. Huge Axe was more adventurous and intrepid, while Primal Chaos City Leader was more conservative and reserved.

“Congratulations, Teacher.” Luo Feng noticed the improvement in the power of his teacher.

“Still not as impressive as you,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “I just became a universe supreme master, yet you’ve already killed one. Few in Universe Ocean have killed universe supreme masters.”

“It’s luck,” said Luo Feng.

“You said before the fight that you had a 30 percent chance of winning.” Primal Chaos City Leader shook his head. “It’s not about luck.”

Luo Feng stopped arguing. He waved his hands, and Star Tower appeared beside him. An armor giving out cyan light flew out from the side gate at the base. An ancient force permeated from the armor, which shocked Primal Chaos City Leader. “Great Thunder Godly Armor?”

Luo Feng nodded and said, “Yes. Teacher, you just became a universe supreme master, and I just killed that Great Thunder Star Master. This Great Thunder Godly Armor is my gift to congratulate you on becoming a universe supreme master.”

“You don’t even have a supreme true treasure.” Primal Chaos City Leader shook his head. “This Great Thunder Godly Armor would be very useful to you. Keep it for yourself.”

Luo Feng was dazed. “Teacher, I have several supreme true treasures, so I really don’t need this one. I came here to give you the armor. Please take it.”

Primal Chaos City Leader frowned and said, “Stop arguing with me. You know how I am. If this were an attack type or palace type supreme true treasure, I would’ve taken it already. However, you don’t have a supreme true treasure armor. You’re adventuring through Universe Ocean now, yet I’m guarding the primal universe and won’t go out for a while. I don’t need Great Thunder Godly Armor! You do!”

Luo Feng was anxious. “How… However… even Darkness Master and Peng Gong Master have a supreme true treasure. But you…”

He was indeed grateful. But he also had several valuables, so he didn’t need this supreme true treasure. As for survival skills, almost nobody in Universe Ocean could compare to him. He had already planned to give Great Thunder Godly Armor to his teacher.

“It’s different for Darkness and Peng Gong,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “That was during the war. Besides, you have both the attack type and palace type supreme true treasure, which is why I allowed that to happen. As for Great Thunder Godly Armor, I don’t want it. End of discussion.”

Luo Feng was dazed, but he had to acquiesce. He realized that his teacher was just balancing the power and rights in the human race. A great being like this wouldn’t accept gifts from others for no reason—even from his own disciple. If it was a valuable valueless to his disciple, he would accept it, yet it was a supreme true treasure armor that was vital to his disciple, so he couldn’t accept it.

I’ll adventure through Universe Ocean, Luo Feng thought. I’ll keep going on adventures, and if I get new armor, my teacher won’t have any excuses to reject it.

Luo Feng understood that it was very difficult to get another supreme true treasure armor.

“Teacher, this is a set true treasure Great Thunder Star Master left after he died, Universe Imperial Cone.” Luo Feng pointed to Star Tower, and a set of valuables flew out of the gate at the bottom of Star Tower and floated on the waves. There were 36 triangle cones.

“Universe Imperial Cone?” Primal Chaos City Leader’s eyes gleamed, and he exclaimed, “This is a very powerful set true treasures, only second to supreme true treasures. I’ll accept this valuable. Thank you.”

Primal Chaos City Leader could feel the passion of his disciple, and he had already upset his disciple by rejecting the armor. He wanted to make Luo Feng feel better by taking Universe Imperial Cone.

After the congratulatory gift, Luo Feng told his teacher, “Teacher, I need to ask you for a favor.”

Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “Just say the word.”

“My Remote Ocean has the power of ‘Creation,'” said Luo Feng. “I need billions of creatures and objects from the original universe, alive and lifeless. I need them all. Even though I prepared some last time, the original universe is enormous. Only with the power of the entire Hong Alliance can we gather enough material.”

Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “This concerns you becoming a universe supreme master. Rest assured, I’ll tell the entire Hong Alliance. Even if we search every inch of the original universe. We’ll prepare all the materials, valuables, and creatures. How do I give them to you?”

“Just put them in the endless Remote Ocean,” said Luo Feng. “Especially those creatures. There are billions of life forms in the universe, and those from the weak races have short lifespans. I might need to practice for tens of millions of years or even more… Those creatures might die during the period. I’m thinking that we should capture as many as possible so that they can keep breeding. Then I’ll have infinite sources to study.”

Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “Okay. It’s so simple. I’ll prepare some world rings and let them live there. Do you have any requirements for their power?”

“From the weakest to sector lords,” said Luo Feng. “The more powerful a life form is, the more difficult it is to analyze them. I might need a long time to study a sector lord.”

“Okay, I’ll go arrange it now.” Primal Chaos City Leader was careful.

“Don’t capture too many,” said Luo Feng. “Just capture a few of them for them to breed. I’ll study them, and I won’t hurt them. I need as many kinds of life forms as possible, but I only need a few from each kind.”

Luo Feng was worried that some races might go extinct because of him. After all, there were many universe knights in the Hong Alliance, and when they acted, they might annihilate an entire race. That was why Luo Feng said that he only needed a few from each. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Teacher!” said Luo Feng. “I’m going to Universe Ocean now, and please don’t tell anyone where I’m going.”

“Do you mean…?” Primal Chaos City Leader understood it immediately. “You want them to think you’re still in Universe Boat?”

“That’s right.” Luo Feng nodded. “If someone knows that I came back to the original universe, then other powers will know that I’ve left Universe Boat. I’m afraid that Pei Xing Master might get away. Though it’s unlikely that he can get away, I don’t want to risk it! After all, if he enters Purple Moon Holy Land, I won’t be able to do anything about it.”

“Okay.” Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. He now understood why Luo Feng had chosen to meet him in endless Remote Ocean. Endless Remote Ocean belonged to Luo Feng. Nobody would know that Luo Feng’s original body had already been back to the original universe if Luo Feng showed up here. “I won’t use Universe Imperial Cone until you kill Pei Xing Master.”

Luo Feng shook his head and smiled. “It depends on my luck. I still can’t be sure whether the wing of Pei Xing Master is exactly the one I want. I’ll leave now, teacher.”

After saying goodbye, Luo Feng left the human territory and entered Universe Ocean, heading toward Tilted Peak Sector.

******

It would take a long time to get to Tilted Peak Sector. No great beings were able to find the periphery of Universe Ocean, and anyone could get lost if they fly too far in Universe Ocean.

In an area where nobody from the three universe eras and two holy lands had ever been…

Hong!

In the endless chaos air, an enormous object started to fly at high speed—a million times faster than light speed, then ten million times faster than light speed. The speed limit was nothing to it, and its volume was larger than that of a miniature universe. The giant object was in the shape of a human.

The human-shape object, which was larger than a miniature universe, was flying in a straight line at a steady speed, flying toward the original universe.
