Chapter 1239: The Resistance of Ice Cliff Fortress

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The aura alone dissipated by the deep abyss that Ice Cliff Fortress was dragged into was enough to instill fear within Luo Feng.

“This ancient civilization that has been dead for umpteen reincarnation eras, truly has very impressive methods. It is, indeed, a civilization worthy of creating the Universe Boat! Just Duan Dong River’s remodeling of the Boat of Mausoleum alone was able to make the Boat of Mausoleum so terrifying.”

Over 200 great beings in the hall were listening intently; they wanted to listen to the voices from within the Ice Cliff Fortress, to judge what the fate of the pulse of Divine Eye clan would be.

“After all, that is a supreme true treasure palace. It would be difficult to die in there.”

“Haven’t you heard? In Duan Dong River’s hometown, that ancient civilization does not have such a thing known as a supreme true treasure.”

“The writings found on countless true treasures belonged to that civilization, so obviously, those countless true treasures were left behind by that ancient civilization… Since Duan Dong River dared to say so, then I’m afraid he really is certain about it.”

“No such thing known as a supreme true treasure? What do you mean?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Several great beings could not help discussing discreetly.

Similarly, countless thoughts were surging in Luo Feng’s mind.

Right. That ancient civilization was incomparably powerful and had many beings who were more powerful than universe supreme masters. Even the ancestors of the two holy lands might not be a match for the pinnacle existences of that ancient civilization. With such a high field of vision, their way of viewing weapons would naturally be different. Based on his own experience within the space of the wings and various other adventures while roaming about for all these years, he had come to know that supreme true treasures were also different in terms of strength! Some were strong, the others were weak!

In the eyes of the weaker ones, they were unable to unleash the ultimate power of supreme true treasures, so naturally, they were not able to judge which was strong and which was weak. However, to the ancestor of the holy lands—to Duan Dong River—in the hands of a more terrifying existence, the ability to judge the strength of those true treasures came easily.

Therefore, there was no such thing as a true treasure known to that ancient civilization.

As for the so-called supreme true treasures, the ancient civilization had a clearer way to differentiate them. It was just that, that differentiation method was of little significance to him. Because in the current era, the most powerful beings were the universe supreme masters.

As for the ancestors of the two holy lands? They had never stepped out of their holy land universes before! The groups of powers from the outside world were all suspicious of whether these two ancestors were still alive or not.

“Shi Wu Wings was actually composed of six pairs of wings.” Luo Feng nodded silently. “According to the snippets of memories from the spirit of the wings… there must have been two super great beings exchanging blows, and that caused Shi Wu Wings to become damaged. For such an incredible true treasure as Shi Wu Wings could be reduced to such a state, how terrifying could these two super great beings be? The most likely guess would be great beings from an ancient civilization.”

Upon comparison with the ancient civilization, after endless reincarnation eras, the deterioration of power was obviously severe. It would be so inferior that it might be rendered incomparable to that civilization.

******

Just as Luo Feng was thinking about that ancient civilization, imagining how impressive it was, speculating why it disappeared with the passing of time—

Hua!

The ground within the hall split apart again, and at the spot where it split, a terrifying aura was exuded.

Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!

Three streaks of light flew out, and then suspended right before Thundercoat Devil God; these three items were, namely, a fist-sized ice jade sculpture of Ice Cliff Fortress, a strange-looking beast statue, and a dazzling tri-color pearl.

“These three treasures,” said Duan Dong River. “Based on your method of categorization, two are supreme true treasures, and the remaining one is more unique. It may not be as powerful as a supreme true treasure, but I find it quite suitable for you.” Duan Dong River looked down and smiled. “Thundercoat, do accept it.”

Thundercoat Devil God looked blankly at the three treasures before him. His eyes reflected complicated emotions.

“These—these three treasures…”

“Ice Cliff Fortress?”

“Isn’t that True God Sector?”

“Phantom Heart Pearl?”

The 200-plus great beings, especially the five universe supreme masters, could tell at first glance. Jealousy arose within them all, but the next moment, there was an uproar among them!

“Ah, these three treasures. Could it be the pulse of the Divine Eye clan has been annihilated?”

“Second and Seventh True Masters are both within the Ice Cliff Fortress. Could it be they both have died?”

“Those universe masters who are able to self-destruct early enough can rely on their ability to divide their bodies and increase their chances of survival. But Second True Master and Seventh True Master do not have other divided bodies. They could not escape even if they wanted to. These two universe supreme masters have their own supreme true treasures with them. How could they have been killed so easily?”

“Too, too…”

“This—this is simply…”

“That ancient civilization is simply terrifying.”

Over 200 great beings were smacking their tongues disdainfully.

To the great beings, a supreme true treasure palace was an absolute safe place unless one was so reckless as to charge into another miniature universe, try enter a core ground, or tired of living to foolishly try to break through a reincarnation era or doing things that were out of the norm… If not any of these, then it would be impossible to bypass the protection of the supreme true treasure palace to annihilate the existence living within it.

Field of vision! Based on Duan Dong River’s field of vision, of course he would know that there was no such thing like an absolutely invincible true treasure. In his eyes, Ice Cliff Fortress… He speedily came to a verdict for the strengths and weaknesses of Ice Cliff Fortress.

Over 200 great beings in the hall were surprised and envious. After all, they were talking about two true treasures and an Illusion Heart Pearl, whereby Illusion Heart Pearl was a unique treasure suitably used for executing illusionary attacks. Also, it had the function of guarding one’s soul and was an extremely powerful treasure useful for soul-related areas. Thundercoat Devil God was a born natural in the execution of illusions. Thus, he was a suitable choice to entrust this treasure to.

“Illusion Heart Pearl will easily recognize you as its master.” Duan Dong River looked down and said, “As for the remaining two supreme true treasures, if your willpower is strong enough, you can also get Ice Cliff Fortress to recognize you as its master… True God Sector is the only difficult one. Getting it to recognize someone as its master is extremely difficult. You need to go back and ponder deeply. Spend some time with it. Perhaps you may still succeed.”

Thundercoat Devil God nodded with great excitement. He was not one to waste time either; on the spot, he quickly got to the task of the recognition of a master. The process of getting Illusion Heart Pearl and Ice Cliff Fortress to recognize him as their master was accomplished in one swift move.

“Haha… I may have various pinnacle true treasures, but the only one that is truly unique is Thundercoat.” Thundercoat Devil Master sighed. “Always being close to fighting and killing, but my skill of illusions never did have a good treasure to complement it. Now, with Illusion Heart Pearl, my means of attack are much stronger. Furthermore, with Ice Cliff Fortress as protection, the Divine Eye clan…”

Thundercoat Master’s nine pairs of eyes were twinkling but with a murderous shine. This evoked sighs from the other 200-odd great beings. The poor Divine Eye clan. With this great boost in power, would Thundercoat Devil God let them off easily the moment he got out?

“Thank you, Lord Duan Dong River.” Thundercoat Devil God was so filled with gratitude that he gave a deep bow.

“We are done here.” From where he sat high up in his throne, Duan Dong River gave a slight nod. “You may also take your leave. As for the other candidates…”

Duan Dong River swept his gaze the other 200 odd great beings. “Getting in contact with the inheritance is going to commence right away. Once you get into contact with the inheritance, those who failed must die, and to die means the annihilation of the soul. You various bodies will all perish. All of my pulse must have a soul to be able to start cultivation, so I have chosen only those of you with souls… So, naturally, I have my means of dealing with souls.”

Over 200 great beings were present, but every single one was in for a shock.

Yes. Indeed, the magicube instrument had been the key. Rock Giant Master, the Skeleton clan, and a few other life forms had been eliminated because they were soulless. As for the other rock life forms—plant life forms who were able to enter thereafter—were unique and all had souls.

“Only Milky Way and Blue Blood made it past the third bottleneck,” Duan Dong River said coldly, looking down. “The two of them are the most hopeful ones. And the four who managed to break through the second bottleneck… You all also have a trace of hope. As for those who made it past the first bottleneck, unless you display an outburst of potential within a short period of time, you will only be here to make up the numbers.”

“Now,” he continued. “Thundercoat and the other five universe supreme masters… I will send them off. If any of you here decide to give up, you should quickly make your choice now. This is your last chance!”

Duan Dong River’s voice resonated about the entire hall; the entire hall was in dead silence.

From the very beginning, Duan Dong River had given the candidates many chances to give up and back out. So long as they did not get into contact with the inheritance, there was always some leeway, yet if they got in contact with it, that would change. Which was why this was their last chance for survival. Even Second True Master and Seventh True Master, who had hidden in Ice Cliff Fortress, were annihilated. Who else would dare to entertain thoughts of being fortunate enough to escape death?

“I’m out!”

“I’m out!”

“I’m out!”

Quickly, great beings started standing up, one after another, to volunteer their retreat. Peng Gong Master of the human race from the primal universe—who had managed to pass the first bottleneck—another universe knight, and an undying godly soul all chose to back out of the competition.

“Both of you will retreat,” Huge Axe Creator instructed from the virtual universe. “Being able to make it through the first bottleneck, you have already proven that you have extraordinary potential. Going on to vie for the inheritance would only mean courting death… Our race has Luo Feng here. It will be pointless for both of you to go. Peng Gong, you are one of the great beings supporting our race. There is no need for you to meet your end this way.”

“Understood.”

******

“You shall back out. As for other great beings from our race, let them try for a breakthrough! Remember, bring as many true treasures back as you can. A loss of so many true treasures will be a great blow to our race.”

“Understood.”

******

“Other great beings from our Holy Land will all try to break through the bottlenecks. You must gather enough information about the inheritance. You shall back out, too, and bring the supreme true treasure back.”

“Understood.”

******

Various groups of powers were making speedy arrangements.

Due to various reasons—be it to bring back their true treasures, or because the leaders were unwilling to see a certain great being from their clan becoming ashes and dust—regardless of whatever reason, the number of retreating figures in that hall was soaring.

A short moment later, in that faintly hazy hall within the Boat of Mausoleum, the number of great beings who decided to stay and continue to keep in contact with the inheritance dropped to 236. The others had decided to leave.

“All of you quickly leave.” Duan Dong River pointed far away.

Hong! Long!

The floodgate of the corridor opened.

“Exit through the same route you came in by!” Duan Dong River shouted.

Six universe supreme masters (including Thundercoat), several universe masters, and a small number of universe knights and undying godly souls speedily flew through the corridor and quickly disappeared in the distance.

Hong! Long! Long!

The floodgate was lowered to shut the place off again. The remaining 236 great beings in the hall were all resolute.

Even if we die! We must send some information back!

Luo Feng looked around, secretly in deep respect for out of the remaining 236. It was fated for 235 to be annihilated! Only he, Luo Feng, and Blue Blood Knight had the highest hope of survival. The other great beings were there to take a risk, especially those who merely passed the first bottleneck. It was almost as though they were there to meet doomsday.

Every clan could rise and establish its footing in its own reincarnation era. This was because the great beings of that clan were willing to stand out at the zero hour! In fact, all great beings had made their way up from the bottom and had encountered countless life-and-death situations. They had long since looked upon death lightly and expressed more interest in whether their deaths were worthy or worthless.

For their clan to be able to transcend reincarnations to attain eternal existence, dying would be worth the price!

“All of you here are on the path of no return.” Duan Dong River stood up. “It is fate’s calling that only one of you will receive the inheritance from the pulse of Duan Dong River. Follow me.”

Duan Dong River turned back to look at the throne.

Hong!

The throne and stone wall behind it suddenly split apart to reveal a vast and spacious individual space where there were endless splashing sounds of waterfalls. The fragrance of flowers wafted through the air; there was even the faint chirping of birds and the loud roars of beasts.

“This is the space of inheritance of the pulse of my Duan Dong River.” There was a remote quality to Duan Dong River’s eyes, and he slowly said, “Almost every generation of great beings was here in this space to receive the inheritance. It was just the same for me.”
