Chapter 489: Training world

Translator: Translation_Nation

Editor: Translation_Nation, chuchutrain

Luo Feng grabbed the mouse and opened the management folder, which had options for Life, study and training. He picked training from the three options.

“Training mission danger level is separated into 5 levels.” Luo Feng looked at the screen and frowned. “Which level should I pick?”

Looking at the 5 levels on the screen.

Safe, Mortality rate 0%. Normal, Mortality rate 10%. Difficult, Mortality rate 20%. Dangerous, Mortality rate 50%. Impossible, Mortality rate 90%.

“This is the 1st time I am taking on a mission. I have no knowledge about it.” Luo Feng thought. “I cannot pick randomly, and picking the impossible level would be too irresponsible. If it was Wuka or Rong Jun and the others…they would be prudent and pick the difficult level!”

“Then I…” Luo Feng pondered for a moment and nodded. “I’ll pick the dangerous level!”

Dangerous level, the 2nd highest of the 5 levels had a mortality rate of 50%.

The ones picking the missions were all the most exceptional geniuses of the 1,008 universe countries. Even though all of them had enough wealth to buy treasures and trump cards, many didn’t dare pick too hard of a level the first time. Normally, only after acquiring enough experience would they pick the dangerous level! Even so, the mortality rate was still 50%. This showed just how dangerous it was.

“I’m different from them.”

“I have my two great clones, which are even stronger than this body.” Luo Feng thought, “If I don’t pick a more dangerous mission, there would be no challenge.”

Even though he was confident, he still needed to be prudent, he didn’t dare pick the most terrifying impossible level.

90% Mortality rate!

This was truly impossible for the moment.

Those who dared pick that were all fully prepared and incredibly confident. Yet, 9 out of 10 still died. The surviving ones were probably very lucky, this…was the impossible level!

……

Luo Feng gently tapped and chose the dangerous level missions.

“Di!”

A screen appeared with red warning words.

“Warning! Warning! Your majesty Luo Feng is doing a mission for the 1st time. According to the records and calculations history from the Virtual Universe Company, those picking a dangerous mission as their 1st mission have a mortality rate of 78.2%. Please choose wisely. If you wish to continue, please confirm. Otherwise, please cancel this and accept another mission.”

Luo Feng frowned.

Picking the dangerous level as their 1st mission had a mortality rate of 78.2%?

“Hmph, there’s definitely a way to survive the mission, since the impossible level exists above it! The survival chances of the dangerous level are definitely bigger. If I can’t even pass the dangerous level, wouldn’t that be a joke?” Luo Feng didn’t hesitate and immediately confirmed the selection.

A new glossary appeared on the screen and on it were detailed introductions.

“Dangerous level mission, many core members would usually choose this after much experience and preparation as the mortality rate was still 50%. Similarly, since the danger level was high, the awarded points would be more shocking too.

Below are the dangerous level missions:

1 Wei Si Ka Planet (Virtual Universe Company Primal secret region)

2 Seven Flames Palace (Virtual Universe Company Heaven and Ground secret region)

……

6 Green Demon world (Virtual Universe Company Last Phase secret region)

……

9 Dragon pagoda Planet (Virtual Universe Company Absolute beginning secret region)

……

18 Nine star ocean ( Huge Axe dojo Huge Axe secret area)

……

29 Prison Battlefield ( Universe Mercenary Alliance Glory secret region)

……

36 Blood River world ( Virtual Universe Company Absolute beginning secret region)

……

186 Flame Ice Continent (Universe Galaxy Bank Black hole secret region)

The list was filled with a blur of missions. There were a total of 186 missions that he could accept, and all of them were within secret regions. These were controlled and remodeled regions from the 5 great leviathans. The 186 secret regions were where the missions were located.

“186?” This Dragon pagoda planet is in the absolute beginning region?” Luo Feng gently tapped the 9th mission dragon pagoda planet and took a look.

Universe secret region, the small ones were similar to a galaxy or the milky way. The big ones were similar to a star sector, or even like the size of the Ganwu universe country!

How many planets were in the Milky way galaxy?

How many galaxies were there in the Ganwu universe country?

Hence, in the vast and mysterious universe secret regions, new continents may be produced in the voids of the regions, or even some special planets. Anyway, these special territories within the secret regions, many people could never calculate even with their entire life spans.

“Dragon pagoda planet, a planet produced within the absolute beginning region. Over countless years of being engulfed in universe energies, it resulted in many powerful dragon clans forming within the planet. There were some powerful thunder dragons proficient in flesh and blood battles, some humanoid dragons proficient in spirit attacks, or the golden dragon which was a fusion of the two…” Luo Feng looked at the detailed introduction of the planet.

The introduction was very long.

And the Dragon pagoda training mission was all about hunting dragons!

Become a dragon hunter!

“Hehe, challenging indeed.” Luo Feng muttered. The strongest within the Dagon pagoda is akin to a pinnacle sector lord, while the weakest are at least universe level. One has to be extremely cautious while hunting. The moment a strong dragon discovers you, that wouldn’t be hunting anymore, but rather being hunted instead.”

Luo Feng looked at several missions and was shocked at the many places.

“Blood river world was also located within the absolute beginning secret area.” Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed. The best choice for this 1st mission was one within the absolute beginning region. Otherwise, just flying to the other regions alone would take a very long time, and there were a total of 5 special sectors within the dangerous level missions. Luo Feng was leaning towards Blood river world.

“Blood river world was a floating vast continent within the absolute beginning region. A universe secret region is usually produced from the universe evolution, and this blood river world is a powerful world that was produced within during the early stages of the absolute beginning region. It’s ancientness far exceeds the most ancient universe country.

Within the blood river world, there live countless powerful humans. They’ve formed their own language, culture and training culture.

They heavily respect strength.

……

The detailed introduction for blood river world was very long, and Luo Feng read on nervously.

“Such a mysterious world. There are even aboriginal undyings.” Luo Feng looked with shock. “What a pity, because it’s within the universe secret region, with large amounts of cosmic dust obstructing the way, it made the undyings unable to accelerate to lightspeed and engage in universe travel. Hence, even the undying remained as aboriginals on blood river world.”

Blood river world had a diameter close to 1 light year, which was about 9 trillion km!

Such a vast surface had allowed their population to reach a huge number. Also, since the universe origin laws were circulating within, the strong were like clouds.

“A reminder.”

“The people of blood river world hate outsiders.”

“Hence, to accept this mission, one first has to not bring any technology related items along. As for the few special spirit and genetic weapons, unless blood river world already has them, they cannot be brought as well. One also has to follow the attire of the normal people of blood river world.”

“If one’s looks are too peculiar, he would also have to undergo physical alteration to fit in with the look of the people of Blood River world.”

“Blood river world’s language differs from universe language. One has to learn the language before entering.”

……

Luo Feng laughed and nodded. “Luckily the humans of blood river world have tens of thousands of races. My looks are considered normal.”

“As for weapons”

“With the study of origin laws, it doesn’t make a difference whether I use a blade or spirit weapon.”

“About language.”

“With my consciousness speed that’s comparable to a quantum computer, I should be able to learn it in half a day.” Luo Feng finally decided on choosing Blood River world. Although it was an ancient world over a trillion years old, this was a place with a new culture, and had humans as the leaders of the planet, unlike the other missions with different and strange things with those secret areas.

Blood river world’s mission was:

1 Acquire 1 Blood river crystal, (This was a blood river world specialty, as blood river crystals can be found nowhere else in the universe.). A successful mission equals 10,000 points.

2 Acquire the title Blood warrior and the Blood river medal. A successful mission equals 100k points. (Reminder, 99.5% of those who take this mission complete the 1st one.)

As long as 1 of the 2 was completed, it would represent that the mission as a success.

“Di.”

“Please confirm the acceptance of the Blood River mission.”

“Acceptance successful.”

“Please fill out the departure time. The Virtual Universe Company will arrange for a ship to send you to blood river world.”

……

Luo Feng smiled at the mission.

There were two reasons why he chose this mission. First reason was because of its unique culture and it’s unique training culture. The second reason was because it gave a large amount of points, amounting between 10k to 20k. Very few missions had 2 choices of missions, and the 2nd mission of Blood river world actually reward 100k points when completed.

My god.

How much was 100k points? Only passing the 11th level of the heavenly bridge gave 100k points, and Luo Feng was stuck at only the 5th. As for the 11th? It would take at least another 1,000 years.

“Blood warrior title, blood river medal? Maybe it’s very difficult, however I still have to try.” Luo Feng smiled.

After receiving the mission, he began to do all sorts of preparations.

“Nan shen armament is one of humanity’s 9 godly weapons. The blood river world has no such materials to make it. Hence, when I enter blood river world, I cannot take it out. The gold shadow blade too is the same way. I’ll custom make a sharp blood shadow blade.” Luo Feng custom made the blood shadow blade and a 6 edged shield.

The materials were all available on blood river world!

“As for cloud contact vine?”

“The cloud contact vine was a plant life form, and it was rare within humanity’s 1,008 universe countries. There’s no such thing on blood river world. I’ll temporarily let the Mosha clan clone wear it.”

“Luckily! Blood river world has the space ring.”

“I’ll order some armor, helmet and boots.”

Luo Feng swiftly made preparations. He first had to make sure that there weren’t any stark differences between him and the native people. As the world was huge with tens of thousands of different human races, as long as he wasn’t too peculiar, it naturally wasn’t too much of a problem!

However…

If anyone took out a laser gun in blood river world and was discovered by an absolute warrior, sector lord or undying, that would mean certain death, as blood river world had no such technology advancement.

“Blood river world language?” Luo Feng spent 3 days and with a consciousness speed comparable to a basic quantum computer, he learnt 18 types of blood river language.

“Hm!”

“Everything is prepared!”
