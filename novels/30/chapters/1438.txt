Chapter 1440: True God

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The true gods of the Ancestral God School were gathered at the Ancestral God Palace.

“So unbelievable. Even we true gods cannot help but kneel?” Cold Whale True God roared in his deep voice. “Milky Way Horde Leader was merely a universe master previously. Even if he has now begun on his breakthrough to become a true god… we are true gods too. So why is it that even when he is umpteen light years away, we are still kneeling to him as if we have no control over our own bodies?”

“Not to mention you true gods,” said the aged ancestral god. “Even we three ancestral gods, who have always been favored by the willpower of the origin, had gone down on our knees when the golden light penetrated through time and space to shine upon us…” The aged ancestral god shook his head.

“So ridiculous.”

“So unbelievable.”

The many true gods, including Nine Remoteness True Master, found this very difficult to understand. After all, they were true gods! And they all had their own miniature universes. In terms of social status, even the willpower of the origin had to show them due respect. Their orders, once given, were strictly enforced because this was what they were entitled to. Even the willpower of origin was unable to make them fall to their knees and bow down to it! However, just moments ago, regardless of how far apart Luo Feng was from them, every single one of these true gods of the primal universe had gone down on their knees.

“What an exaggerated yet unbelievable sight,” Double-Face Ancestral God said. “It’s unquestionable. Milky Way Horde Leader must have started his breakthrough to becoming a true god!”

“Yes, he must be starting to transform into a true god!”

“What a commotion, with the entire primal universe bowing down to him…! How impressive is his might! It must be an exceptionally unique breakthrough.”

There was no dissenting opinion among these various true gods of the Ancestral God School. Everyone had taken the reason for these exceptional happenings to be Luo Feng starting to become a true god.

Luo Feng was described as “starting” to become a true god because there was a process to becoming a true god. First, he had to expand his god country into a miniature universe. Then his godly body had to undergo a breakthrough at the most fundamental level. And these steps, naturally, required some time.

******

The group of true gods from the Space Beast Alliance were all speculating.

“How did Milky Way Horde Leader become a true god? What a commotion he created, bringing the billions of races of the entire primal universe down to their knees so involuntarily…”

“Even if it was the legendary godly power path he had taken, I have seen for myself, when I was in the World of Jin, the inheritance of the ancient civilization. I do not recall seeing any documented records describing such a scene when one becomes a true god via the godly power route.”

“True. Regardless of law route or godly power route, this situation is unprecedented.”

They were filled with doubts. What could have happened to Milky Way Horde Leader for him to create such a great commotion? Such an occurrence was unheard of.

******

Within the human territory, Void Gold True God said amidst sighs, “No wonder Milky Way Horde Leader had yet to become a true god all this while. Given his exceptional talent, he would have become a true god in the billionth era. Yet, all this while, he had not. He had merely maintained his status as a universe master and become the Number One Master of Universe Ocean. Milky Way Horde Leader chose an extremely difficult route—a route that even someone like Milky Way Horde Leader, with his exceptional talent, would need to painstakingly cultivate for billions of eras. Today, he finally arrived at the path to breakthrough, and the moment he succeeded, his success reverberated throughout the entire primal universe, where the billions of races fell to their knees before him. Even true gods had to kneel before him.”

Void Gold True God lauded Luo Feng’s achievement. “If Milky Way Horde Leader succeeds, all the various races can be hopeful of stemming the Sector Beast crisis!”

“Haha…”

“Milky Way Horde Leader. His power must be so incredibly profound now.”

“Impressive.”

Amongst themselves, the humans had long ago placed Luo Feng on a pedestal, where they looked up to him with high regards. Luo Feng’s breakthrough this time around had such a massive impact that it was soul-awakening. Even the numerous true gods were brought to their knees. Other races may have been a little jealous, but the humans were incomparably excited and thrilled because they belonged to the same race. When Luo Feng made such a great achievement, they, too, would naturally stand to gain endless benefits.

In the future, if Luo Feng did transcend reincarnation, then the entire human race could exist for eternity.

******

The billions of races within the primal universe were in frantic discussions. The same went for the ordinary life forms on countless planets. They did not know who Luo Feng was, but that lofty golden figure was imprinted within the core of every living soul. Thus, it was unforgettable. On the other hand, the higher-ups of those races would most certainly be able to recognize that this was the Number One Master of Universe Ocean: Milky Way Horde Leader Luo Feng!

“Milky Way Horde Leader has finally achieved a breakthrough.”

“The billions of races from Universe Ocean have hope now.

“Now, we can be hopeful of pulling through the Sector Beast crisis.”

All the weaker races were filled with excitement and anticipation.

******

There was a miniature universe not too far away from the primal universe. It was Sitting Mountain Guest’s miniature universe.

Sitting Mountain Guest flopped down on the peak of one of the mountains amidst the rolling mountain range. He was a sorry sight, but there was a trace of relief on his face.

“Almost. Almost…” Sitting Mountain Guest shook his head while feeling thankful. “I almost knelt too!”

Earlier on, Sitting Mountain Guest had been in his own palace, carving on a piece of rock when the golden light suddenly shrouded his surroundings. At that point, Sitting Mountain Guest’s expression had changed drastically, and with great perseverance, he had immediately fled to where a universe channel was. Within his palace, there was a universe channel that connected his palace to his miniature universe. With great difficulty, he had resisted that golden light and made his escape through the universe channel to return to his miniature universe.

“What is going on?”

Sitting Mountain Guest frowned as doubts filled his mind. He was shrouded by the golden light, and it had imprinted a lofty, golden figure on his soul. Without question, he was able to recognize his disciple, Luo Feng.

“What is wrong with Luo Feng? Why is he kicking up such a storm? The ordinary true gods were all unable to put up any resistance and knelt right away. Even for me, if I had stayed a moment longer, I think my will would have submitted to that golden light, too.” Sitting Mountain Guest frowned. “That golden light does not contain the willpower of the origin; rather, it contains the supreme law!”

The willpower of the origin did not scare Sitting Mountain Guest at all. The willpower of the origin only had the ability of thoughts. By itself, it did not pose much of a threat. But the supreme law was a totally different story.

The supreme law dictated how everything operated within the entire Universe Ocean, such as why the primal universe forever went through the cycle of destruction and birth, and why there was the birth of Sector Beasts. Why must the true gods transcend reincarnation after they had finished undergoing three reincarnation eras? Everything and anything had to follow the laws! The supreme law did not have any ability of thought, no trace at all. It was merely a set of rules to be adhered to. Yet it was above all else.

“Luckily, the supreme law was only there to guide the life origin of living souls,” Sitting Mountain Guest said to himself. “Life forms of the lower class naturally hold great respect for the life forms of the higher class, and they will definitely admire those higher-class life forms… The supreme laws merely served to guide and reinforce so that every single life form, including true gods, would obey their instincts and bow before the golden light. Luckily, it’s only for guidance. If it were to force us to go down on our knees, even I myself would have to kneel.”

Sitting Mountain Guest sighed. He was not afraid of the willpower of origin. Because the willpower of the origin was restricted by laws, it had to fulfill the requirements of various regulations and restrictions. But the Universe Law of Universe Ocean was different. Even though he had much understanding about a great many secrets, when it came to the supreme law, his understanding was patchy.

“My disciple… Could it be that he finally achieved his breakthrough?” Sitting Mountain Guest was filled with doubts. “No doubt, he has taken the godly power route. For such a long time, he did not break through. I suppose he set high targets for himself since he has great ambitions to attain the third level of the godly power route. However, no matter what, the third level of the godly power route should not lead to a commotion of such extent. Even the supreme law has descended to offer its congratulations!”

Sitting Mountain Guest could tell that this had been a means of congratulating Luo Feng. This achievement was simply incredible, so even the supreme law was here to send its congratulations. Also, it was the cause of the billions of races bowing before him to express their best wishes.

Within the solar system in the human territory, all the golden light had dispersed.

Luo Feng regained normality.

“Huh?” Luo Feng was in a daze. “Just now…”

A moment ago, he had felt as though he had seen every single being in the primal universe, had traversed countless secret grounds, and had every single living soul dropping and kneeling to bow before him. Very quickly, Luo Feng thought no longer.

“My life gene level.” Luo Feng could distinctly feel the fruitful outcome of this breakthrough. Clenching his fist, he could feel the tremors of his godly power. This delighted Luo Feng. At his level, his grasp of control over his strength was extremely precise. Previously, he could even verify that his godly power level had reached up to 89,999 times. That was how high his degree of precision was.

“100,000 times! A full whole 100,000 times. No more, no less. My life gene level has actually gone up to 100,00 times.”

Luo Feng was seriously shocked. God! This was simply unbelievable.

The godly body was divided into three levels. 30,000 times to 60,000 times constituted the first level. 60,000 times to 90,000 times would be the second level. 90,000 and any limit that was almost 100,000 times constituted the third level.

The inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River documented that no one had ever attained a level of 100,000 times. There was also no precedent for anyone achieving 100,000 times within the records of the World of Jin. It was noteworthy that these were records, meaning to say that in the ancient civilization, the pulse of Duan Dong River, and the World of Jin, no one had ever heard of a being with 100,000 times life gene level. This was only a legend! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Even to the ancient civilization, it was only a legend. There had never been anyone who had managed to achieve it! There were no records of it at all!

“I—I did it…” Luo Feng stammered, in a daze. He mumbled to himself, “First, I reached 89,999 times. Then I did a thorough study on the school of universe masters, true gods, and true gods of void space, then on the school of the Sector Beasts in order to find the commonality between these two schools… Could it be that, throughout the ancient civilization, no universe master was able to achieve this? Right. It seems like in the records of the World of Jin, the records on Sector Beasts were also legends, and the Sector Beasts present in the records all seem to have been very powerful. Those were Sector Beasts in their growth stages.”

At the moment, Luo Feng did not understand why he could have attained 100,000 times. This was because he lacked exposure to relevant knowledge!

After all, even the pulse of Duan Dong River and the pulse of the World of Jin had never seen any great being who managed to achieve 100,000 times in life gene level via the godly power route. Since no such occurrence had ever been discovered, naturally, the exact cause was unclear. Luo Feng had succeeded, but he could only arrive at some vague speculations to explain his success.

“Time for my breakthrough.”

Luo Feng took a stride forward.

Sou!

Immediately, he teleported back to Milky Way Holy Land. Amidst the vast Milky Way Holy Land, high up in the sky above the boundless Remote Ocean, Luo Feng, who was fully clothed in a white robe, appeared out of nowhere.

“Boundless Remote Ocean, recombine!” Luo Feng looked down at the Remote Ocean beneath him.

Hong! Long!

Endless fog instantly rose to surround Remote Ocean. Thereafter, his life gene level rapidly skyrocketed from 89,999 times to 100,000 times. However, this time, the breakthrough he achieved no longer featured the supreme law appearing to congratulate him. Following this breakthrough, his godly power increased in quality while his body naturally shrank a little from the previous diameter of 12 light years to a diameter short of 11 light years.

Hua! Hua! Hua!

Boundless Remote Ocean was swallowing like mad. In the vast void space above, the shadow of the ocean of laws of the primal universe started to emerge according to the primal universe law. A tremendous amount of ocean water appeared out of thin air and fell continuously upon the boundless Remote Ocean.

In the past, Remote Ocean needed to rely on the talent technique Creation to automatically recover in order to gradually increase in size. Yet at that moment, it had reached 100,000 times.

A limitless godly body! Which could absorb to its heart’s content!

The boundless godly power water descended from high above and meshed with the boundless Remote Ocean. This caused the Remote Ocean godly body to continuously increase. At the same time, Luo Feng’s Remote Ocean body, Mosha body, and Golden Horned Beast body—which had been stationed about Universe Ocean, patrolling the grounds—were rushing back.

The moment of the final breakthrough, the various bodies would combine. These other bodies would then dissipate to nothing. If they did not make it back in time, wouldn’t the treasures they carried with them be at risk of being lost?
