Chapter 1348: Battle of Life or Death

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

All the 3,000 warriors and strange beasts were led by several true gods and headed toward that giant stone arch.

“Milky Way.” Northern Wind’s eyes gleamed, and he transmitted his voice. “Kill as many as possible. If you perform well enough, you’ll be selected into the special army.”

“Special troop?” Luo Feng was startled.

Northern Wind transmitted his voice. “There are many troops in the east army, and 99 percent are in the ordinary troops. Chances are none of the 3,000 candidates can get into the special troop. However, you’re very powerful, so there’s hope for you. Remember, we need to stay close to each other when we just get in.”

Northern Wind and Luo Feng then followed the crowd and entered through that stone arch.

Hong!

The time and space immediately changed after they passed the stone arch. They entered a deserted plain, and there was sand everywhere.

“Where is this…?” Luo Feng looked around, and soon, the other 2,999 warriors and strange beasts also looked around.

They could see clearly an area of 100 million square kilometers, and it was darker in the distance. It was a desert.

The control over the time and space of the ancient civilization is perfect, Luo Feng thought. He was standing right beside Northern Wind, and the other warriors were also staying around them.

As they were looking around, an invisible force arrived, covering the entire desert. All the warriors and strange beasts looked up. A single-horned man in black armor appeared in the sky. He looked down with his cold, golden eyes. Suddenly, two beams of golden light shot out of his golden eyes!

Hong! Hong!

The beams hit the desert, becoming circles around 1,500 warriors and strange beasts. Then the group of warriors and strange beasts encircled on the left had a blurry red light, while those on the right had a blurry yellow light.

An invisible pressure covered everyone, and all were intimidated.

The force wasn’t strong, yet its superiority and the trembling of godly power made everyone realize that the being in the sky wasn’t a true god. Instead, it must have been someone at a higher level… A true god of void space!

Luo Feng looked up. A true god of void space? A being who could transcend incarnations?

The single-horned man looked down and yelled, “You will be divided into two teams! You’ll try to kill each other and to kill as many as possible. When I tell you to stop, those who survive can join the military. Show all your power, and if there are any exceptional ones, you might be able to join the special troop!” Then the single-horned man yelled, “Begin!” and disappeared into the darkness.

******

Half of the warriors and strange beasts glowed in red light while the other half was yellow. They couldn’t help feeling ferocious.

“Damn it.” Northern Wind clenched his teeth.

Luo Feng glanced around. Although the warriors from Dry Wilderness Tribe all stayed together, almost 100 warriors were still encircled on the opposite side.

“No wonder Northern Wind told me to stay close to him.” Luo Feng looked around.

“Kill!”

“Howl!”

The warriors and strange beasts all started to roar and turned into streaks of light. The warriors from Dry Wilderness Tribe all knew well enough, not to fight those from the same tribe, and they chose to fight those from other tribes or lands, trying to kill them.

“Special troop?” Luo Feng’s eyes glinted fiercely.

He had three goals he wished to achieve in the World of Jin. The first one was to gather creatures from the World of Jin, especially bodies of true gods, for him to study the composition of creatures. It could help him achieve a life gene level of 90,000 times as soon as possible and became a true god.

The second goal was to learn about the secrets in Universe Ocean. And the third was to gather machine type valuables!

He knew about the ancient civilization, so he knew clearly that for the ordinary class—and even for the great beings class—machine type valuables were highly useful. Only when someone became a supreme being would machine type valuables be rendered useless. The more ordinary someone was, the more useful a machine type valuable would be!

A true god with a precious machine type valuable could rival a true god of void space!

Even though he had Boat of Mausoleum, that was only for defense. Shi Wu Wing was also an assistance type, and it was highly advanced. The complete Shi Wu Wings would be for highly advanced beings to use. Luo Feng needed those most suitable for him!

The east army had a great many machine type valuables—even ones that could be used by millions of true gods all at once, not to mention those used by individuals. Those within the second category were Luo Feng’s target. As long as he could obtain some of them, the humans would have a very strong and stable status in Universe Ocean.

However, he inferred that the original mind knew everything, yet it had still told the ancestral gods to guide them instead of stopping them. That meant the more powerful a machine type valuable was, the more difficult it was to get it. On his trip here, he hadn’t seen any true god obtaining a machine type valuable. That meant only those with special statuses could obtain them, not mediocre ones. Only those in the special troop could obtain them!

There were special forces in the army on the earth, and training was offered in the virtual universe company. The same rule applied here. There were countless soldiers in the army of the World of Jin, and it was normal that there were special troops who were equipped with special valuables.

******

Broken bodies and blood were scattered everywhere, and the great beings from both teams fought each other crazily.

“Kill!”

Luo Feng held Blood Shadow Blade and rushed toward the warriors and strange beasts. He killed everyone with a red light!

The blade light was gleaming and sweeping across the area. The time and space were very stable, so there were no space ripples even beneath the power so many universe masters fighting each other.

The World of Jin is a world where there is lots of fighting, thought Luo Feng. The ancient civilization has never ended here, so the great beings are generally more powerful than those in Universe Ocean.

He could tell that the weakest ones were at top-tier level four, while most of them could reach level five or even top-tier level five. As for Northern Wind, he was covered in gray, and each attack from him could reach level six. He was the center of Dry Wilderness Tribe, and he had a supreme true treasure armor.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

During the fight, some great beings from other teams might make sneak attacks, which made the fight furiously! They were all universe masters, so it was difficult to kill someone in one shot. However, universe masters fought at high speed; it was not surprising that two-thirds died within half an hour, meaning the weaker ones needed to be careful and stall for time. All they needed to do was to stay alive.

The weaker ones were careful, but the stronger ones—especially the two with supreme true treasures—were trying to display as much power as they could. They wanted to be selected for the special troop. They included Northern Wind from the yellow-light team and a strange beast from the red-light team.

“Argh!” the strange beast roared and rushed toward Northern Wind. “Die!”

“You’re the one dying!” Northern Wind yelled as he rushed forward.

Hong! Hong!

The two of them fought each other, and after only a few attacks, Northern Wind was hit on the head and rolled away. He immediately stood up and clenched his teeth, shouting, “Burning godly power technique! My father is the master of Northern True Ocean! This is the power burning technique of Northern True Ocean.”

The strange beast with two wings was roaring, which upset Northern Wind.

Luo Feng, who had just killed a warrior from the opposite team, turned around and yelled, “Let me fight him, Northern Wind.”

Hong!

Luo Feng raced forward like a bolt of lightning.

“Great.” Northern Wind retreated. He had found this strange beast to be terrifying during his fight against him. It carried a set of supreme true treasures, and he had the godly power burning technique. Though there were rules in the military, and some inheritance information within the military was forbidden to be leaked, the elements comprehended by individuals were exceptions to the rule.

Northern True Ocean was a superpower among the strange beasts. There were nine true gods of void space in Northern True Ocean, and the leader was a mighty limit true god of void space. They all enjoyed high status in the World of Jin. Compared to them, the Dry Wilderness Tribe were nobodies.

“Die!” the strange beast roared and dashed at Luo Feng.

“Burning godly power technique?” Luo Feng sneered. It wasn’t anything new to him. There were many volumes in Duan Mie created by the three ancestral teachers, and universe supreme masters could learn the first three volumes! It was not uncommon for some great beings to create techniques like those of the first and second volume. After all, the World of Jin contained a rich inheritance from the ancient civilization as well.

“Slash!” Luo Feng’s shadow took on a blurry appearance.

Hua!

Luo Feng went to the back of that strange beast, and his Blood Shadow Blade turned into a thin trace of light. That light immediately expanded and became a miniature universe, enveloping the entire strange beast.

******

The killings were brutal, and with time passing, warriors and strange beasts died. But the most ferocious fight was the one between Luo Feng and the strange beast.

The strange beast had a set of supreme true treasures, and he had a godly power burning technique. Luo Feng had practiced for over eight million years, and in the space of inheritance, that was more than eight million eras. Over the course of eight million eras of training, his blade techniques and close combat techniques had been greatly enhanced. However, he wasn’t sure about the situation in the army, which was why he didn’t use all his power. After all, it would be incredible if he utilized all his power.

He was a talent that was cultivated by the inheritance from Duan Dong River. And in the World of Jin, all the precious inheritance was in the military. How could he be so powerful without the special inheritance? It was unrealistic! The military might carefully examine his background, which would get Luo Feng into trouble. After he learned more about the military, he could slowly increase the amount of power he demonstrated, improve his power, and get what he wanted.

“Your godly power is under 50 percent now. You’re not my match!”

Luo Feng was mad. His body moved fast as lightning. During those eight million eras, he had created a close combat technique, Flowing Gold, based on the close combat technique Blood Ocean created by the third ancestral teacher from Duan Dong River.

Peng!

The strange beast rolled and hit the endless sand. His godly body was at less than 50 percent, being ten times weaker than it had been at the beginning, and he was not Luo Feng’s match.

“Stop!”

A powerful force arrived suddenly.

If the force before had been like a breeze, this one was like a mountain.

Hong! Long!

The universe masters who were fighting all groveled, including Luo Feng. They couldn’t resist this power in the slightest.

Is this the power of a true god of void space? Luo Feng wondered in amazement. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The single-horned man walked down and looked around. 921 survived.

“You and you!” The single-horned man pointed at Luo Feng and that strange beast. “You two will join the Python River Army.”
