Chapter 1425: Sworn Enemy

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng was filled with expectation as he maneuvered Star Tower. He was on his way to Purple Moon Holy Land universe when Divine Eye True Master sent a message.

“Milky Way Horde Leader. That Sector Beast was at the peripheral region of Purple Moon Holy Land, where, likewise, it devoured the origin for a day and then left. At the same time, Purple Moon Holy Land wanted me to inform you, Milky Way Horde Leader, that you… are no longer required to go there.”

Luo Feng’s greatly enthusiastic heart instantly cooled down. Luo Feng’s expression darkened as he transmitted his response. “What do you mean… no longer required to go there?”

“What Purple Moon Holy Land meant was, the deal agreed upon previously is called off,” Divine Eye True Master said helplessly.

“Then what about the promise they made previously?” Luo Feng continued to ask in an indifferent tone.

Divine Eye True Master said, “The other part of the news means… The promise made earlier on was based on the condition that Milky Way Horde Leader would help them deal with the Sector Beast. But now, the Sector Beast has left of its own accord. There is no need for Milky Way Horde Leader’s help in dealing with it, so, unquestionably, there is no need for them to give you a true treasure in exchange.

“Milky Way… honestly speaking, when they transmitted this piece of information, even I felt angry just listening to it! But, you should know. The Sector Beast is not only an enemy of Purple Moon Holy Land but a common enemy for all the races within Universe Ocean! I know you are filled with anger now, and you will most likely want to let the Sector Beast devour Purple Moon Holy Land to its heart’s content… While swallowing for eight to ten days is no big deal, if the time it spends on devouring grows too lengthy, we cannot stand idly by any longer.”

“I know,” replied Luo Feng. “I will place importance on the big picture. But spread my word… From this point on, Purple Moon Holy Land will be my, Luo Feng’s, sworn enemy.”

Someplace far away, Divine Eye True Master was taken aback. He could also feel the intensity of that endless anger raging in Luo Feng.

“Milky Way…” Divine Eye True Master could not help but feel worried. To deal with the Sector Beast, they had to depend mainly on Luo Feng.

“I will look at the big picture!” Luo Feng said. His response sounded reasonable enough, but all the more, Divine Eye True Master felt that his words contained limitless fury.

Within Star Tower, Luo Feng’s expression was hideous as he held onto his transmission token. His anger was so great that his veins were threatening to pop out and burst.

“Purple Moon Holy Land, Purple Moon Holy Land…” His eyes flashed coldly. “I wanted to give you all chance, but since you all are not appreciative, my Shi Wu Wings would rather make do with their imperfections and make you all regret that you have done!”

Toward Purple Moon Holy Land, Luo Feng no longer held on to any feelings of pity. However, he was also aware that he could not allow the Sector Beast to continue devouring the origin of Purple Moon Holy Land as it pleased. After all, every time it devoured an origin, it would disappear for half a year. Various races of Universe Ocean had long suspected that the Sector Beast spent that time “digesting and absorbing” whatever it had swallowed to increase its power! A human grew when it consumed food. A golden horned beast grew when it ate metals. All operated on the same theory. The Sector Beast might, unfortunately, feed on the universe origin to become stronger. It seemed highly possible.

Purple Moon Holy Land was, after all, a holy land universe of a true god of void space. That origin would likely be the equivalent of hundreds and thousands of origins of true god level miniature universes combined! If Luo Feng allowed the Sector Beast to continue devouring like that, who knew what would be the result would be?

If the Sector Beast became incomparably powerful, to the extent that no one could fight against it, then Purple Moon Holy Land could be faced with its doomsday. But if this continued, the entire human race—including Luo Feng and his family—would have to face the fate of annihilation… This was what Luo Feng could not accept. He did not dare to use the lives of family and friends, and the lives of the entire pulse of Earth, as bargaining chips. He was reluctant to gamble with them!

“Purple Moon Ancestor, you are indeed ruthless!” said Luo Feng. “You have already guessed that I would not dare to take such a gamble and that I would not risk it all just for a single piece of a true treasure… Perhaps you are not concerned about the universe masters under your command, or perhaps your Purple Moon Holy Land would prefer to continue withdrawing into passive defense.” Luo Feng’s gaze turned icy. “But your Purple Moon Holy Land shall be my, Luo Feng’s, sworn enemy, and I shall remember this! Before I achieve my breakthrough to become a true god of void space, I will definitely try to destroy your Purple Moon Holy Land.” Luo Feng was bellowing the words in his heart as he spoke them. “I will think of every way possible to ensure that you live to regret this.”

To destroy a miniature universe of a true god of void space—usually only an eternal true god executing some superior methods could achieve such a feat. This was a piece of information that Luo Feng had learned in the past. However, Purple Moon Ancestor’s miniature universe was not considered large.

The smallest miniature universes at the level of a true god of void space had diameters around one billion light years, and the biggest could have diameters as long as ten billion light years! The Purple Moon Holy Land miniature universe had a diameter of 2.1 billion light years, while East Emperor Holy Land miniature universe was 3.2 billion light years in diameter.

The size of a miniature universe was related to many different factors, including the erection of the internal structural framework when a miniature universe was established, or whether the godly power route or the law route had been chosen to become a true god. The bigger the miniature universe, the more power was provided, and the more stable it would be.

For instance, the legends of true gods of void spaces had mentions of a “miniature universe with a diameter of 10 billion light years” that was comparable to the lowest level miniature universe of eternal true gods! Of course, that was merely a legend. Even for an extraordinary talent who had once attained 90,000 times life genes—or even for the three generations of ancestors at the true god of void space stage—none of their miniature universes had ever reached ‘0 billion light years. This perfect, ultimate limit was only a legend!

When one was a true god of void space, it was usually unlikely for the miniature universe to be of a diameter that was merely one billion light years. Normally, the size would not be so ridiculously small. Weaker true gods of void space would have miniature universes with diameters around two billion light years, while stronger ones would have miniature universes with diameters around three billion light years. The elites’ miniature universes could reach diameters of four billion light years, while those of extraordinary talents could reach around five billion light years. In short, the higher-level one attained on the social scale, the more difficult it was to maintain the miniature universe.

As for a talent that achieved 90,000 times life genes via the godly power route? And the three generations of ancestors? A true god of void space with a miniature universe that had a diameter of ten billion light years, this was just a legend of the ancient civilization. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Purple Moon’s miniature universe is not big, thought Luo Feng. It’s even smaller than East Emperor’s. If I become a true god of void space, by relying on an automaton type treasure and various secret techniques, I can certainly achieve an outburst to unleash the power of an eternal true god. Perhaps then I might be able to destroy Purple Moon Holy Land universe!

Luo Feng made a mental note.

******

Luo Feng’s expression grew increasingly awful as he tried to contain his anger.

“Teacher…”

“Luo Feng?”

Fire Dome and Hong were looking at Luo Feng. They felt a little worried, as they did not know what might happen next.

“I’m all right,” Luo Feng replied. “Let’s go back and continue to guard against the Sector Beast.”

“We’re no longer going to Purple Moon Holy Land?” Fire Dome was shocked.

“Not going.” Luo Feng shook his head. He walked straight to the steering wheel and sat down, making no further comments.

Fire Dome and Hong looked at one another as they both speculated what was going on. However, both of them soon heard the news from Primal City Chaos Leader. What they learned greatly angered them. This was outright bullying. The promise made previously had been broken in the blink of an eye. How shameless could they get? It seemed Purple Moon Ancestor was not the least bit interested in appeasing the wrath incurred by the humans and Luo Feng—not even the slightest trace of it.

If that was the case, then they would be their sworn enemies!

Time passed.

This time, less than a month after it devoured the origin of Purple Moon Holy Land miniature universe, the Sector Beast reappeared in Universe Ocean. The timing defied the expectations of every powerful group. This time, it moved on to devouring the origin of Rampaging Devil God’s miniature universe.

Upon devouring the origin of one miniature universe, it disappeared for half a year. Upon devouring the origin of another miniature universe, it disappeared for another half a year.

Sector Beast had resumed its attacks on miniature universes, and this worried the various races of Universe Ocean. If it went on, many miniature universes would collapse.

******

It had been three years since the incident with Purple Moon Holy Land.

Within the void space surrounding Sea Badger True Master’s miniature universe, a silver-white vessel hung suspended in space. Luo Feng’s Golden Horned Beast body was inside the vessel. Although it was known as Golden Horned Beast body, Luo Feng had already transformed it so that it took human form.

Perhaps for common universe masters, size and form would have an impact on their power. As for Luo Feng, who had achieved 89,999 times life gene level on his godly power route, he could easily change his life structure to take on the form he would require, according to the circumstances he was in. And he could also unleash his power to perfection.

A piece of information was transmitted over to Luo Feng. “Milky Way Horde Leader, Milky Way Horde Leader! Sector Beast has appeared outside my miniature universe now!”

Golden Horned Beast Luo Feng was momentarily shocked, but shortly after, he showed his delight. “A message from Sea Badger True Master?”

“Milky Way…”

Suddenly, Divine Eye True Master and several other true gods were sending messages over as well.

“Hahaha…” laughed Golden Horned Luo Feng. “After such a long wait! See, what did I say? So long as no one knows my whereabouts, I will secretly stay hidden. Then surely, there will be at least a chance of encountering this Sector Beast while it is out to devour miniature universes.” Luo Feng was thrilled. “What a pity it did not cross paths with the other team I deployed.”

Luo Feng had divided his other bodies into two teams this time around. One route was taken by his Remote Ocean body and his Mosha body, who traveled with a series of powerful treasures like Shi Wu Wings, Wu Qi God, Star Tower, and Blood Ghost Blade.

The other route was taken by his Golden Horned Beast body alone. Although equipped with several automaton-type treasures, in terms of the ability to unleash power, it was inferior to the other team.

“Even so, the automaton-type treasures that my Golden Horned Beast body possess far surpass Divine Eye True Master and Jue He True Master’s treasures.” Golden Horned Luo Feng was very confident. “This Golden Horned Beast body has combat power that is stronger than any of them.”

Speaking of power, his other team was, of course, much stronger—great enough to surpass the power of all the other seven true masters put together.

As for his Golden Horned Beast body, compared to the other seven true masters, it might have been slightly stronger, but the advantageous position it had over them was not obvious. Of course, given Luo Feng’s comprehension and cultivation for the past trillion eras, even this ordinary Golden Horned Beast body could prove to be an extremely difficult opponent.

“Maybe this time around, I will be able to kill that Sector Beast.”

Golden Horned Luo Feng smiled.

Sou!

This silver vessel teleported over right away. At the same time, Luo Feng transmitted a message to Sea Badger True Master: “Sea Badger, I’ve arrived.”

“Arrived?” Sea Badger True Master was shocked. It had only sent out the call for help a moment ago. Nonetheless, it was overjoyed. Milky Way Horde Leader was the first to arrive. At least he would be able to prevent that Sector Beast from devouring too much. “These are the coordinates of where the Sector Beast is.”

Sea Badger True Master sent the coordinates right away.

Within the peripheral area of Sea Badger True Master’s miniature universe, a chaotic airflow was filling up the void space. A certain area within this endless chaotic airflow was filled with black fog. In the midst of it was a lofty figure. It was Sector Beast Morosa, and it stood upright, right in the middle of the black fog, waving its tail as it delightfully devoured the origin of that miniature universe.

Streams of distorted light rays extended and penetrated the void space.

“Wu!” Sector Beast Morosa was quite pleased. It felt that the whole Universe Ocean was its plaything.

Weng!

The surrounding space suddenly froze.

“Sealing of space!” Sector Beast Morosa was shocked. “So fast!”

Based on its experience, anytime it was devouring a miniature universe, the master of that miniature universe—a true god—was likely to drive his palace supreme true treasure over to harass him. But the sealing of space was highly unusual because those true gods were usually quite eager to chase him away. Why would they seal space? Only when top-tier true gods like Nine-Headed Demon Master arrived, or if a big group of true gods arrived together, would they dare to seal the space.

Hua!

A silver-white vessel arrived. When the cabin doors opened, a man wearing a suit of golden armor strolled out.

Sector Beast Morosa took one look and was instantly taken aback. “A universe master?”
