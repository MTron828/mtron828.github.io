Chapter 1371: Setting a Killer Trap

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Venue for mission to receive a title (Law master level): Godly King Valley.

Details for mission: Godly King Valley, place of residence of His Majesty the Godly King, who was the existence who created Wu Qi God. There is a tower, Wu Qi Tower, that is nine stories high. The ninth story is the highest level. Up until today, only His Majesty the Godly King had ascended to the ninth story before. The goal of this mission is… Enter Wu Qi Tower and get to the ninth story. The one who makes it up to the ninth floor will be sealed with a title!

Reward: 10,000 military credits earned if one survives and returns back; by returning alive with success achieved, one will be sealed with a title. There are endless benefits.

Penalty: There will be no penalty should one fails to accomplish the mission.

Important reminder: This mission is extremely dangerous; all the participants are top-notch law masters representing the four armies of the World of Jin, who have undergone much training and honing of skills. They are all amply prepared, but the number who are annihilated still reaches a high average of 90 percent. You must always be careful and vigilant.

The mission to receive a title might have seemed easy, as there would be no penalty if one failed. Yet the insanely high mortality rate was, in fact, the most terrifying penalty! Every single law master who accepted the mission to receive a title would know about this extremely high mortality rate, so all of them would have prepared palace type true treasures, or even automaton type true treasures to bring along as they tried to achieve success. But the number of deaths was still exceedingly high.

“There is no room for carelessness,” Luo Feng reminded himself discreetly. “The moment I lose my life, Golden Claw God, Boat of Mausoleum, Blood Ghost Blade, and Python River Armor will all be taken away by the other warriors. And then I will become a laughing stock.”

The captain’s voice was transmitted from the side. “This mission is very simple. You new recruits, so long as you do not behave recklessly, will be able to pull through this mission easily! Previously, it was a disaster-level mission. Under my leadership, we have survived. You nine new recruits… You are still not willing to hurry over to our team? We are willing to accept you all. Why are you all still hesitating to join us?”

The captain and the warriors under his command were all beckoning loudly to the nine new recruits.

“Humph, follow you?” Ku Fa said coldly. “Even if you all pull through this time, the next time around, you may all perish. Have you not tasted enough loss? Previously, I joined forces with Yu Luo, leaving your captain with no choice but to continue helping you. Do you really think you have a chance of survival?”

The nine new recruits immediately started to have second thoughts.

“I am willing to go with Ku Fa and her troop,” Wu He started shouting from the side.

Luo Feng, who had been contemplating his mission to receive a title, turned around. There was a very disharmonious situation unfolding beside him, with the captain on one side and Ku Fa on the other. With Wu He also joining Ku Fa and company, it was down to the nine new recruits who were filled with uncertainty. The new recruits even looked toward Luo Feng, as they all felt that the captain, Ku Fa, and everyone else were fearful of Luo Feng.

“If you choose to follow Ku Fa and her troop, at the very least, she would not have the power to give up on any of you even if she intended to,” Luo Feng said lightly.

The moment this was said, a handful of new recruits who had been hesitating a moment ago walked toward Ku Fa’s side. After the first one had made a final decision to join Ku Fa and her troop, the other new recruits also followed suit and made their way toward Ku Fa and her company. They all felt that what Milky Way said made sense. In terms of power, Ku Fa was not the captain’s match, so even if Ku Fa wanted to take advantage of such a big group of warriors, she did not have the capacity to do so.

Suddenly, those warriors under Captain’s command were bellowing as one.

“Milky Way! Are you trying to make an enemy out of Captain?”

“Milky Way!”

Captain kept mum, but that pair of gray eyes under his curved horns glared hard at Luo Feng.

“Making an enemy out of your captain?” Luo Feng shot a look at the captain and gave a light snort. “Is he even worth it?”

The warriors immediately glared at him while the captain’s expression instantly changed to one of great displeasure. “Milky Way!”

“I have no time for this nonsense. Ku Fa, Wu He… Time to go.” Luo Feng smiled as he greeted Ku Fa and Wu He. Then, right away, he flew toward the contorted space wormhole not far away.

Ku Fa and her warriors still felt some resentment toward Luo Feng for refusing their offer, but they were also aware that even the captain and his warriors were helpless against that Luo Feng. All the more, Ku Fa and her warriors were unable to do anything. She and her warriors did not hold any feud against one another, so their enemy’s enemy should be their friend.

“Let’s go.”

“Let’s go.”

In a mighty manner, Ku Fa, Wu He, and their group of warriors also flew straight into the wormhole.

The expressions of the captain and his warriors were awful. One by one, the experienced warriors all looked at their captain.

“Captain, how can we just let Milky Way go like that?”

“Captain, if we just let him be, Milky Way will still find ways to be at odds with you. We don’t even have ten warriors on our side now. On the other hand, Ku Fa and company have the greatest number of warriors. If Milky Way decides to stir up trouble… Captain, you might lose your prominence. We cannot let him go unrestrained any further.”

“Captain…”

The captain replied with great indifference, “We shall not be bothered with him for the time being.”

Sou!

With the captain in the head, the troop flew into the wormhole. The other experienced warriors looked at one another. Why would their captain, who was always so proud and ruthless, show leniency to Milky Way? Could it be that he was also fearful of Milky Way? These old warriors were starting to entertain all kinds of thoughts in their minds, but at that same time, they, too, flew into the wormhole.

In a certain region outside the East Army military camp, a great number of wormholes were clustered together.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Batches of warriors were emerging from the wormholes in succession, all chatting among themselves. Then, maneuvering their battleships, they speedily left.

Not too far from this region, on a large, ancient tree, was a warrior clad in gray armor. He was keeping watch.

“There are so many who are going out to accomplish their mission,” the warrior in gray armor said, transmitting a voice message. “What do you say? Just keep watching like this? How long are we going to continue keeping watch?”

At another spot not too far away, a warrior leaned against a large tree, looking very comfortable, but in fact, he was keeping a close watch over a large area of a certain region. “Now, the previous era has just ended,” he replied. “A new era has just begun, and all the lesser troops are setting off to carry out their military mission. Now is the most turbulent time… If Luo Feng wants to set off, I think he should set off now. Ancestor has given specific orders for the ten of us to keep watch over the surroundings here. After we get through this 100-year period, we can set off to accomplish our own missions designated to us.”

At that moment, there were ten universe masters in total from Purple Moon Holy Land, and all of them were gathered in the same area, keeping a close watch. This was the peak period when warriors would head out. The chances of Luo Feng appearing were currently the highest. How could they afford to be careless? Even if it meant they had to put off accomplishing their own missions, they had to continue to keep a close watch.

“Look, it’s the Blood Ochre Army.”

“Watch it closely. That is a special army troop. It is highly possible that Luo Feng will appear within a special army troop.

Amongst the great number of warriors appearing, occasionally, warriors from special army troops would also appear. With the passing of time, a small group of warriors from special army troops sometimes could be seen.

Hong!

Suddenly, a group of figures flew out from the exit of one of the wormholes.

“It’s the Python River Army, which is also a special army troop. Keep a close watch.” The 10 universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land Universe were keeping watch, and now, six of them were looking in this one direction.

All they could see was a group of figures flying out in succession. All of them wore their Python River Army standard armor, and judging by their armor alone, their identities were easily verified! Because there were universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land who had already entered the World of Jin as part of the first batch of newcomers, they had already obtained some information about certain special army troops within the East Army.

“Milky Way, we shall part ways here then.”

“Milky Way, if you are not going on the mission with us, where are you going?”

Wu He and Ku Fa asked their questions one after the other.

Luo Feng smiled as he replied, “I have important matters to see to.” As this was just a casual conversation, whether it was Luo Feng, Wu He or Ku Fa, all of them were speaking normally, without any of those sneaky voice transmissions.

The six universe masters were all keeping a close watch, yet even when they laid eyes on Luo Feng, they did not realize he was their target. Since joining the army, Luo Feng’s appearance had changed slightly. His complexion had changed a little; it seemed rougher. Furthermore, he was covered by his Python River armor, with a helmet over his head. That was why they did not recognize him at first glance.

Although they might be far away and could not hear the content of their conversation well, the six universe masters only needed to read the movements of their lips to discern the content of their conversation!

“Milky Way?”

This name caught their attention right away.

“That target has an appearance resembling a human! Very possible that it is Milky Way Horde Leader, Luo Feng.”

“Lock eyes on target.”

“I will go verify right away.”

Of the ten universe masters who were standing guard from afar, one separated from the team right away. Soon, a seemingly ordinary warrior clad in a silver armor suit transformed into a stream of flowing light and flew toward the region around the wormhole where a great many warriors had gathered.

Sou!

There were simply too many warriors around Luo Feng. And why would he need to pay close attention to such an ordinary warrior? That warrior flew past Luo Feng.

“Huh?” Luo Feng’s brows twitched as he turned around.

That aura… It was an aura he recognized. There were only so many great beings from Universe Ocean in the World of Jin. Back then, just to stop that massive object, several thousand universe masters had gathered together. Naturally, Luo Feng was acquainted with many other universe masters. And that aura a moment ago belonged to one of those universe masters that he had gotten to know back then.

This aura that I am detecting must have come from Purple Moon Holy Land. Could it be so coincidental? To actually meet one of them here?

Luo Feng had his doubts.

Seems like he has discovered me, too. Even if he has discovered me, what can he do…? Here, Purple Moon Holy Land has no authority at all.

Luo Feng had never really held Purple Moon Holy Land in high regard. Plus, the rules of the World of Jin were determined by the army. Here, Purple Moon Holy Land was nothing at all.

“I’m leaving!”

Luo Feng maneuvered a battleship and charged across the vast expanse of space, where he left at high speed.

******

The warrior clad in silver armor who had flown by Luo Feng’s side just now, confirmed within a split second, “That is Luo Feng’s aura. It is his aura! Just now, that warrior from the Python River Army is Luo Feng. I am sure of it. It is Luo Feng!”

“Information confirmed. Let’s head back right away to report this to Ancestor.”

The universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land were extremely excited as they immediately brought the news back to Purple Moon Ancestor.

******

Universe Ocean, in Purple Moon Holy Land universe.

Within the main hall, a purple figure stood at an elevated position. Beneath him, ten universe masters were down on their knees.

“Are you sure that it is Luo Feng?” asked the purple figure, looking down.

One of the universe masters, who was kneeling at the bottom, replied reverentially, “Yes, it is Luo Feng. His name in the World of Jin is ‘Milky Way’! And I personally flew past him and sensed his life aura. It is the godly body of Luo Feng’s earthling original body.”

“Very well.” Purple Moon Ancestor nodded slightly. “Since we have confirmed that he is a warrior of the Python River army, someone must look into this for me right away. Exactly which large troop—or small troop—from the Python River army is he in? We must be very clear about this.”

“Understood!”

Every single warrior standing below him responded. This was very easy, as there were only so many warriors from Python River army. So long as the name was known, adding on the appearance… Surely, it would be easy to clarify and investigate.

“After investigating the matter, there is no rush for action,” said Purple Moon Ancestor ordered. “The moment you have clear answers, just wait patiently. Wait for Luo Feng to return to the military camp. The moment he does… you can start the killing! If you rush the attack and the Hong Alliance learns about it first and informs Luo Feng, he may escape before we can do anything. That is not good. Wait until he returns to the military camp. Wait for him to fall into our deadly trap. Then there will be no way he can ever think of escaping!”

“Understood!” the ten warriors respectfully replied in unison.
