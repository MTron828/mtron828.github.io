Chapter 1197: Go to Universe Boat

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng was holding the black pendant in the bloody pyramid. The material of the black pendant was almost the same as that of the cyan keepsake. There were strange beast sculptures he had never seen before on the keepsake, and there were nine fangs on the strange beast. Its eyes emitted fire as if it were the king of darkness.

“The black pendant represented the black secret space.” Luo Feng nodded as he played with it. “The objects in Universe Boat are indeed mysterious. The gravitational power is able to tear apart pinnacle true treasures, yet this one remains intact.”

Are there valuables in the black space? Luo Feng wondered.

Actually, it was highly likely that there were valuables in the black space, especially valuables from the great beings from the first universe era. They didn’t want their valuables to fall into the hands of those from the second universe era or those from the original universe, so they’d rather keep them in the secret space and hide the keepsakes.

Of course, some great beings would destroy the valuables outright. Different great beings had different ideas.

I wish that Five Chaos Master left some valuables in the secret space, Luo Feng thought. However, that secret space is a land of valuables.

Black keepsakes, cyan keepsakes, and silver keepsakes—each of them represented three individual spaces. The secret space itself was very special. Luo Feng’s original plan was to go to the Black-Striped Stone Pillar to sharpen his willpower, which was why he closely followed that black keepsake.

“After such a long time being hit by gravitational power without being protected by godly power, the life imprints in the black keepsake are already very weak.”

Luo Feng tried to make it recognize him as its master. The godly power went in, and it found that the life imprint inside was already very weak. After trying several times, the life imprint left by Five Chaos Master was gone.

The black keepsake would belong to Luo Feng once his life imprint was infused.

Hong!

The bloody pyramid landed on the green water layer. The green water was extremely cold and could rival Frozen Lake Fire.

“If I got trapped in the abyss, it would be very difficult for me to get out. I need to carefully inspect this abyss first. The map left by Jie Fanzi only has a very brief record of this abyss.”

Dimming golden light started to permeate on the green water.

It was deep, enormous, and complex. Jie Fanzi had only been here for a while, so perhaps he didn’t even record one-millionth of this abyss.

“I need to depend on myself in this abyss.” Luo Feng started to inspect his area carefully. After all, he would reside here for a while.

Chaos airflow permeated everywhere in Universe Ocean.

Two beings were teleporting time and time again. The forces from them were both pretty ordinary; however, every universe master in Universe Ocean would be able to identify them. After all, all the universe masters adventuring Universe Ocean would be notified that some beings must not be messed with.

These two could definitely not be messed with. They were the third true master and the sixth true master from Divine Eye clan. The sole-eye phantoms behind them had already disappeared, which made them look like ordinary human beings.

“Five Chaos suffered a great loss this time, and those other races laughed at us of the Divine Eye clan. Humph! This time, we’ll show the power of our Divine Eye clan together. Even the two holy lands don’t dare to mess with us, yet that human from the original universe dared to.”

Indeed. The two holy universes didn’t want to mess with the Divine Eye clan. The Divine Eye clan was indeed extremely powerful, as there were lots of universe masters. Of course, it was nothing compared to the two holy lands. However, there were seven universe supreme masters topping the two holy lands. Universe supreme masters wouldn’t be bred in the holy universes.

Besides, the small universes of the surviving universe supreme masters from the holy lands were already annihilated. Even though they were still alive, their power was significantly weaker after the miniature universes were annihilated.

Which meant the two holy lands were indeed intimidated by the Divine Eye clan.

“The end is coming,” a green-eyed man said. “We have to take our last chance, and anyone who dares to mess with us will be punished. Luo Feng fell into the abyss with that Five Chaos, so the silver-winged true treasure and Extermination Godly Armor are in the abyss. Some universe supreme masters will go—even that Huge Axe from the human race.”

“Yeah, it’s possible.”

“Huge Axe is young. Although he’s powerful, he doesn’t have a supreme true treasure, so he isn’t our match. We have seven universe supreme masters, and we obtained ancient techniques from the three Lands of Extremis. Perhaps only Teacher Origin can suppress us. As for the others, we don’t need to be afraid. We will punish any universe supreme master who comes this time, especially Huge Axe.”

“Yes.”

“We’ve arrived.”

Sou! Sou!

The seemingly ordinary beings arrived at Universe Boat.

******

Universe Ocean, the inner area of Titled Peak Sector.

The waterfall covered everything, and there were giant rocks flying in it.

Hong!

A shining axe appeared.

The giant axe was more than 90,000 kilometers long, and the head was enormous. There were ancient engraving sculptures on the haft. The engravings were mysterious, which made the huge axe gleam… It tore the space around it apart. The waterfall bounced back, and the huge rocks were cracked. All the laws retreated!

“Break!”

Hong!

The space in front of it was clotted, and, hence teleportation was impossible. However, the huge axe resisted all the laws, and it kept getting faster and faster. 100 times faster than light speed, 10,000 times faster than light speed… The speed kept surging, and after only several minutes, it made its way through this clotted area.

Then it teleported and disappeared.

******

Huge Axe Creator finally made his way out of Tilted Peak Sector after lots of godly power, teleportation, and rapid movement.

“Finally.”

A huge, barefoot man was standing in the space right outside Tilted Peak Sector, watching the endless space in front of him. “The Divine Eye clan is from the first universe era, so they’ll act crazily, as they’re facing the life limit. Besides, they’re very proud of themselves and even look down upon the two holy lands. They’ll seize this chance to show their power. Haha, Teacher Origin roamed Universe Ocean, and no universe supreme masters dare to be reckless in front of him. I’ll take Teacher Origin as an example. With this huge axe, I’ll be able to show my power. Divine Eye clan, I’ll start with you.”

The barefoot huge man was furious and confident. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hong!

With one teleportation after another, he soon left Tilted Peak Sector and started to head off to Universe Boat.

In the depths of the ninth abyss.

The bloody pyramid was flying slowly, and it inspected the area around it using Golden Country. There were quite a few special areas in the abyss, and 99 percent of the areas could not be inspected by Luo Feng.

“No wonder the map left by Jie Fanzi is so brief. I can only use my eyes for inspection.”

Luo Feng looked out from the bloody pyramid. Star Tower was a supreme true treasure, so it couldn’t block Luo Feng’s sight. He used the most primitive way to inspect the surroundings.

One day passed.

“The abyss is indeed very dangerous,” said Luo Feng. “Top-tier palace type true treasures won’t be able to survive more than five minutes, and even pinnacle palace type true treasures won’t survive more than a day. Luckily, I have Star Tower.”

Luo Feng was terrified by how dangerous the abyss was. He could run into places as dangerous as Lava Ocean, and the only difference from God-Destroying Stream was that there weren’t being like Molten Lava Devil God who would attack people.

“It’s so dangerous, but there isn’t a single true treasure born. This doesn’t make sense. Normally, the more dangerous a place is, the more likely that powerful true treasures will be born, yet it’s completely the opposite here.”

Luo Feng was confused. There were great beings from universe eras who came here for inspection. Yet they all proved that there weren’t true treasures born in the abyss. Even if there were, they were left by dead great beings.

Hu!

Star Tower kept flying. It found different dangerous areas, yet it failed to find any valuables.

“Huh?” Luo Feng frowned. He wasn’t blocked by Star Tower, and he saw a black object.

“Go there.” Luo Feng controlled Star Tower and flew there. It kept getting closer and closer. That black object looked like a black scale—a black scale from Extermination Godly Armor.

“Is it…?” Luo Feng looked excited.

Star Tower flew into the windy area.

Endless golden light permeated. Even though it was disturbed, it could still attack or bound, and it grabbed the black scale immediately. After a while, it took the black scale back in Star Tower.

Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed. “It’s a scale from Extermination Godly Armor! I’ve found one! So the others are close!”
