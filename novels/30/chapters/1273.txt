Chapter 1275: Luo Feng To End It All

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Within the main hall of the Boat of Mausoleum.

“Hahaha…”

“Satisfaction! Such satisfaction!”

“The demons may not even have the chance to lament now, and to think they can take advantage of us when we are weak. They must be gritting their teeth out of abhorrence for us now, and they must be filled with unwillingness. Haha, the more they abhor us, the better it is, let them hate us all they want. Haha…”

In the main hall were Luo Feng, Peng Gong Master, Darkness Master, Long Yan Master, Ice Mountain Master, Qing Dong Master… All 15 universe masters were gathered, and all of them were incredibly exhilarated and excited!

“Look! Look at those two demon ancestors!” Remote Lord Master pointed outside. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were no obstructions hindering their view from the internal walls of the hall inside or the cabin walls of the Boat of Mausoleum, so Luo Feng and his company of universe masters could easily look out at the starlit sky outside. From where they were, they could see far into the distance, where a gigantic silver snake and a beast with a serrated shell were entrenched in a spot amidst the starlit sky. Apparently, these two demon ancestors were looking over at the same time, and their eyes were filled with the flames of endless, burning rage.

Hatred! Anger!

“Haha…” Luo Feng and his group of humans, who were all higher-ups of the race, laughed even more heartily than before. This war was turning out to be better than expected!

“Luo Feng, how many did we catch? I vaguely saw that beside Shock Demon Ancestor, only three remained, and you have caught six of them… Are they still alive?” Qing Dong Master asked.

“Out of the six universe masters I caught, three had other bodies,” Luo Feng said with a smile. “The other three self-destructed right away after regaining consciousness. There are three remaining!”

“There are three with you,” Darkness Master said. “In my Black Prison Tower, there are two, adding on the one you killed! This time around, the demons lost a whopping total of six universe masters and also quite a sizable number of true treasures.”

“Six!”

“Tsk tsk. What pinnacle race has lost six universe masters in one go before? This is something that has no precedence.”

“Before Shock Demon Ancestor and Dream Demon Ancestor, we have caused them a loss of six universe masters… The other groups of powers who are a notch less capable will certainly not dare to make any rash moves now.”

This was a matter of course. Like the Thorn Ring Alliance, Nine Territories Alliance, and some other alliances, they probably only had a total of 20 to 30 universe masters! Even when all the powers of the higher-ups within the alliance were put together, they might not even be comparable to the demons. Merely two universe supreme masters from the demons would be powerful enough to wipe out the entire group of universe masters.

Even the demons had to lose six universe masters. What if the Thorn Ring Alliance were to fight the humans? In just one confrontation alone, would they not lose as many as 10 to 20 universe masters?

The other races were shaken by the news they heard and did not dare to intervene in this war. So a large batch of mediocre groups would not intervene recklessly; in fact, throughout the entire original universe, the total groups—including mediocre powers, scattered powers, and some others—was the majority of the original universe’s total! They might not be so powerful when they stood alone, but collectively, they did add to the overwhelming number.

“Luo Feng, how did you manage to do it?”

“What happened?”

“Yes, yes, Luo Feng! How could the Boat of Mausoleum catch hold of six universe masters at one go?”

Long Yan Master, Deserted Mirror Master, Void Gold Master and the rest were all filled with curiosity and questions.

“You all want to know?” Luo Feng’s gaze swept over every single one of the universe masters there. They all nodded.

Of course, they wanted to know. How vicious this method was, to catch hold of so many universe masters at one go! Of course, they wanted a glimpse of that effective method that Luo Feng had used, and since Luo Feng could tell Darkness Master and Peng Gong Master about his strategy earlier on… this must not have been some despicable, underhanded method.

“Don’t regret it,” Luo Feng said teasingly.

“What is there to regret?” Long Yan Master looked dubious.

“You all will know in a while.”

Darkness Master, Peng Gong Master, and Luo Feng looked at one another, then laughed.

With a wave, Luo Feng said, “Look carefully!”

Hong!

The doors of the main hall opened automatically, and a group of universe masters turned to look toward the door. A short moment later, a bout of incomparably strong willpower suddenly enshrouded the group. At that moment, some were forced to their knees with their bodies trembling—such as Remote Lord Master—while the majority of the other universe masters all wore terrible expressions. Only Ice Mountain Master and a few others were able to resist the impact. As quickly as it came, the willpower vanished into thin air, and these universe masters were able to recover completely.

“An impact of willpower?”

“Such a strong impact of willpower!”

“What treasure is this?”

The universe masters were still in shock, yet they could not help asking questions.

Darkness Master who was standing to the side, said, “For most of you, your willpower is not strong enough, so you are unable to get near that treasure at all.”

Luo Feng nodded. “That treasure is in another place along the corridor of the Boat of Mausoleum, a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers away from here. I have removed the protective cover over it just now, so you all felt the impact of its willpower. If that treasure were to be placed before you all, those whose willpower is able to meet the limit of a universe master would be fine. Others, I’m afraid, might not be able to shoulder the impact. The even weaker ones might lose consciousness.”

“It’s really that impressive?”

“Meeting the limit of a universe master in order to safely arrive before this treasure?”

Long Yan Master, Ice Mountain Master, Deserted Mirror Master, and all the others were aghast. The impact of this willpower was simply overbearing.

Luo Feng laughed. The impact of the willpower of that drop of godly blood might be spread out in all directions, but even so, one’s willpower had to meet the limit of a universe master’s willpower in order to stand safely before it! If one could restrain and restrict the entire impact of its willpower in one direction… it could sweep up all the great beings below the willpower of a universe supreme being. This was definitely an extremely terrifying weapon.

It was not easy to find a vessel that carried pure godly blood. True treasures like Shi Wu Wings and Star Tower could! And the Boat of Mausoleum could do the same. Furthermore, it could seal off the impact of willpower.

“I know, Luo Feng. Once the cabin doors of your Boat of Mausoleum open, there will be a sudden impact of willpower surging out for sure!” Remote Lord Master stood up and lamented with a sigh, “That group of universe masters is originally under our joint attack, be it illusionary or otherwise. For them to suddenly experience the impact of such strong willpower, I’m afraid those with weaker willpower will be knocked senseless, and even those with willpower meeting the limit of a universe master… because they are also under attack, they too will probably be affected. Only those whose willpower has met the level of a universe supreme master can be fully confident. With the supplementary help of a pinnacle palace true treasure’s suction power, there is really not much resistance they can put up. In a moment, they can be sucked in.”

“Yes, that is why only Prohibition Master, Blood Chisel Master, and Scorched Catfish Master managed to escape.” Luo Feng sighed.

When there was war, those destined to be caught were those who were weaker. The powerful ones were more difficult to apprehend.

******

After they relished in the moment of celebration, it was soon time to part.

“Let’s go back to the primal secret region.”

“You all go ahead,” Luo Feng said. “I will stay behind to control this Boat of Mausoleum and end this once and for all.”

“Mm.”

Everyone nodded, including Darkness Master.

At the same time—

Buzz!

Hazy black light rays appeared within the main hall, just like how Luo Feng could make use of god country transportation to get within Star Tower. This was the same concept; if Luo Feng, as the master of this Boat of Mausoleum, was not obstructed by anything, he could certainly make use of god country transportation. And this was the safest transportation ground. If he was somewhere outside, the two demon ancestors filled with endless rage would probably attack him.

Amidst the hazy black light rays, Darkness Master, Peng Gong Master, Long Yan Master, Void Gold Master, and the rest in the group all looked at Luo Feng. All were nodding or smiling! Faintly, on the other end of god country transportation, they could see that vast god country world.

Shua!

Then everyone disappeared.

******

In the virtual universe, at the apex of Thunder Island, Luo Feng went to meet his teacher.

“Great victory.” Primal Chaos City Leader closely followed the situation of the war and how it progressed. The moment he saw Luo Feng, his emotions ran high. “Well done. This turned out much better than we planned. This way, the situation the human race is in will improve.”

“Yes.” Luo Feng nodded. “Teacher, shall I then follow our original plan and start negotiating with the demons?”

“Yes, go ahead.” Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “I hope the demons know when to back off. They better not let greed get the better of them!”

“All right.” Luo Feng nodded.

******

Inside the Boat of Mausoleum, Luo Feng sat on his throne in the main hall as he sighed with relief.

“First step. Not bad at all.” Luo Feng said to himself. “At least we humans are no longer in such a desperate situation.”

Initially, what he was most afraid of was that when the humans were defeated, other races who feared losing out because they were a bit slower would all rush over to attack them. Then almost all the groups in the entire original universe would be rampaging their way toward the humans… That would have been a truly desperate situation. The humans would have had to give up all of their territory and retreat fully into the primal universe. What would their future be like then?

Great beings would rise after they had gone through the grueling life and death honing processes. And if they became public enemies of the original universe, then all the powers in Universe Ocean would certainly lay siege on them! Then the human force would not be able to make any advances and would be stuck in an even worse predicament.

“They are all gone. It’s only me here.”

Luo Feng rose to his feet. Staying behind alone was because, firstly, with everyone else gone, there had to be someone left behind to control the Boat of Mausoleum; secondly, there had to be a final closing negotiation!

With one deliberate movement…

Hong!

The Boat of Mausoleum vanished into thin air while Luo Feng appeared amid the quiet, starlit sky.

******

Contrary to what the humans were feeling, the two demon ancestors—watching the Boat of Mausoleum from afar—were filled with rage, reluctance, and shame. They were going made. Their shame morphed into anger, with various feelings becoming entangled in a complex mix of emotions. This loss was unprecedented for the demons, and the two ancestors felt guilty in the eyes of the other demon universe masters.

“The impact of that willpower… just what treasure is that?” Dream Demon Ancestor said via voice transmission. “Within the universe, there may be some items that carry evil air or impact of willpower, but those impacts are usually very weak. Most are not even worthy of an undying level! Treasures that could impact those at the level of universe knights are even fewer in number. But that human race actually owned a treasure with willpower that can exert an impact strong enough to bring our universe masters to the verge of breaking point…!”

“Never heard of it,” Shock Demon Ancestor said in a low voice. “Maybe it is inside that Boat of Mausoleum. After all, that Boat of Mausoleum was left behind by Duan Dong River!”

“The loss by our clan this time around…” Dream Demon Ancestor’s eyes were filled with dissatisfaction.

“Loss? Of course, we must remedy our loss.” Shock Demon Ancestor stared hard at the Boat of Mausoleum in the distance.

Hua!

The Boat of Mausoleum vanished into thin air. In its place was a man of the human race who stood amid the starlit sky. With a pair of silver wings and a stone blade slung across his back, he walked over while saying, “Shock Demon Ancestor, Dream Demon Ancestor, do you want your five demon universe masters back alive?”
