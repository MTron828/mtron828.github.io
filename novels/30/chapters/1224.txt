Chapter 1227: Malice

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

On the life-and-death corridor of Boat of Mausoleum.

There were six figures standing in scattered directions while observing the ongoing Rhinoceros Emperor Game.

“Any movement?” Luo Feng’s brows were furrowed, and he looked outward.

He could vaguely feel the bouts of ripples being transmitted over from the other end of the corridor. He guessed that was where he had earlier exchanged blows with Monster Cuello. The ripples produced during their battle had caught the attention of Shadow Dust Master, Sorcerer Sprite Master, Deer Bug Master, and the two other universe masters from Heaven Clock Clan. Their expressions did not look very well.

“Could it be that another great being has arrived?” Luo Feng mumbled to himself. “Duan Dong River has left the floodgate open, and for those from the Skeleton Race, who were eliminated at the very beginning, he did not kill them. Rather, he let them off unscathed. Obviously, he wanted the news to spread so that he could attract the attention of more great beings.”

The greater the number of candidates, the higher the chances of finding a great being that could accept his inheritance. Luo Feng could understand Duan Dong River’s intentions, but his actions added pressure to Luo Feng.

“Rhinoceros Emperor Game is really difficult. Although it has not even been a year here, in Huge Axe’s universe, I have been comprehending for a couple thousand years.” Luo Feng sighed. “A few decades of comprehension, yet I am still in the pondering stage. Now, I have merely passed up to the 119th stage and have instantly mapped it out onto the crystal pillar.”

From the first to the 10,081st stage, Rhinoceros Emperor Game was unbelievably demanding on one’s ability to comprehend.

Although the regulations had been summed up earlier—indicating that one only needed to decode a complete solution for the first to the 123rd stage—to achieve full comprehension and then to instantly map it out was still very difficult. Luo Feng had to fully comprehend the first 100 stages before he felt that he had made some improvement. That was an improvement in his ability to comprehend, as when he was thinking about the mapping process, his consciousness could take up a more multi-dimensional structure.

A short while later—

Hong!

A strong ripple was transmitted.

A great many figures were flying over. Luo Feng and the other five could not resist turning around to look, and what they saw brought changes to their expressions.

“So many.”

“This—this is really a lot!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“How can there be so many?”

Luo Feng and the rest were shocked. With one look, the dense crowd of figures included at least a couple hundred great beings, and most of these hundreds of figures had similar appearances. For instance, their godly bodies were generally surrounded by green leaf vines. The majority of these figures were obviously from the same race, with only a handful who obviously were different from this race.

Shadow Dust Master’s expression changed slightly. “Almost all of them are from East Emperor Holy Land Universe. Only three are from another race. East Emperor Holy Land Universe has unexpectedly sent so many over.”

“Look, not all of them are universe masters! There are even universe knights and undying souls,” Sorcerer Sprite Master added. “Previously, Monster Cuello had been extremely terrifying, but now, even universe knights and undying souls are able to make it pass Monster Cuello to come here alive… I think Monster Cuello must have taken into consideration the intruder’s ability before showing its power.”

“Yes. This news is very important. Previously, clans only brought more universe masters over to try their luck. They did not bring any undying godly spirits. This news must be transmitted to our clan!”

“If we are talking about undying godly spirits, the Divine Eye Clan has tons of them!”

Shadow Witch Couple’s bodies immediately started to report the news to their clan.

But… the Divine Eye Clan acted first and sent Second True Master and Seventh True Master, who had already set off.

An icy-cold voice resounded. “The turnout is quite big this time.”

Luo Feng turned to take a look and saw a lone figure that was formed by converging light rays standing in the distance—Duan Dong River. Luo Feng merely cast one brief look. Thereafter, he did not pay further heed to Duan Dong River. Every time there were newcomers, Duan Dong River would come out to repeat the same explanation. Earlier on, when the two universe masters from Heaven Clock Clan arrived, Duan Dong River also gave the same explanation.

Occasionally, Luo Feng would pay attention to the situation in his surroundings, but in doing so, he felt that it did not have the slightest bit of influence on his speed of comprehension. He, Deer Bug Master, and Shadow Witch Couple, being the earliest batch, were in an advantageous position. Even if an outstanding great being turned up later, so long as any one of the four managed to meet the basic requirement, he or she would naturally be able to get in contact with the inheritance first.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

“Previously I managed to complete mapping out the first 100 stages. I felt as though things were brightening up, and I was cheering up over the fact that I had made marked improvement. Now, I have fully comprehended the first 123 stages. I am left with this 124th stage.”

Luo Feng cast a glance at that 124th endgame that was quite a distance away. Then he focused all his attention on the crystal pillar before him and started to try decoding! The first 123 stages were fully comprehended, but because the solutions were already publicized, there was no difficulty at all. All he had to do was comprehend the solutions thoroughly. At that moment, he was facing the first true attempt at decoding.

It was not like before, where he just had to look at the outcome of the decoded game to comprehend it. This time, he had to look at the endgame to decode the game. Obviously, he felt terribly bothered.

Once!

Twice!

Luo Feng tried to map the layout, even for those basic elements that he was unclear of, he mapped them based on his gut feeling. With the passage of time… Luo Feng’s mind got clearer, as though his mind was sketching from tens of thousands of dimensions that were combining with one another, and very quickly, the basic elements were determined. This was his first attempt at decoding, and suddenly, he felt that he had gained new experiences on top of the knowledge he had learned from his previous comprehension.

Half a month passed.

Weng!

A three-dimensional virtual shadow of a cone was forming within the crystal pillar. From the outside, no one could see it. The three-dimensional virtual shadow was perfect, suspended in midair. Not the least bit of godly power could be dissipated.

A bout of ripples was immediately transmitted to Luo Feng’s consciousness: “The 124th stage has been decoded to perfect completion.”

Luo Feng was secretly happy. Finally, he had managed to succeed in his first attempt at decoding…

“I shall move on to the 125the stage.”

******

Time passed.

When the group of great beings from the East Emperor Holy Land Universe arrived, Luo Feng and company could feel the ripples caused by battling of supreme great beings from the outside world. And since those were ripples caused by battles in the outside world, to have that amount of power, the battles must have involved universe supreme beings.

It was the fifth month since great beings form East Emperor Holy Land Universe arrived.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

The terrifying ripples were transmitted across the different layers within the Boat of Mausoleum, with their power weakening while traversing layers. When it reached the life and death corridor, where the comprehension of Rhinoceros Emperor Game was ongoing, even the undying godly souls were able to detect the ripples.

For the majority of great beings, like Luo Feng and Deer Bug Master, the amount that they detected was naturally much stronger.

“That loathsome East Emperor Universe!” Deer Bug Master’s eyes flashed with a glimmer of rage as he looked coldly at the universe masters, universe knights, and undying godly souls of East Emperor Holy Land from afar. “That North True Star Master actually blocked the doorway. He actually blocked the cabin doors. Humph! North True Star Master is in an advantageous position only because he has many supreme true treasures. That is why he dares to show such arrogance.”

The three reincarnation eras knew very little about North True Star Master. But for someone who had lived for a long time, Deer Bug Master knew a lot about North True Star Master.

Incomparably ancient, North True Star Master was one of the few remaining universe supreme beings of East Emperor Holy Land Universe. East Emperor Holy Land Universe had been around for a long time and had therefore received countless ancient inheritances. North True Star Master may not have owned a miniature universe, but even relying on the ancient inheritances, his battle power was still considered quite strong among all the universe supreme beings.

Taking the field this time, East Emperor Holy Land Universe was putting in its 101 percent best; North True Star Master had the other universe supreme beings loaning their true treasures to him, so he had brought along a whopping four supreme true treasures! The four supreme true treasures were palace type, domain type, close combat attack type, and long-range attack type, respectively.

Once he blocked the door, great beings from the Purple Moon Holy Land who arrived later would not be able to charge their way in.

Deer Bug Master was furious and grumbled his displeasure. “Loathsome.” Then, pushing North True Star Master out of his mind, he put in his best effort into studying the secret techniques.

******

Battles in the outside world were ongoing. Purple Moon Holy Land and East Emperor Holy Land were really fighting each other to life and death, and both parties were amply prepared. As North True Star Master was first to arrive, his blocking of the entrance of the cabin doors had really left his opponent with no way out.

This time, North True Star Master could arrive earlier due to certain reasons. One, he had an attack type supreme true treasure to help him pave his way. And two, the clan had a more detailed map of the Universe Boat, so he could find an even nearer shortcut.

The difference in arrival time of both Purple Moon Holy Land and Divine Eye Clan was not that far apart. Merely three days.

On the third day of battle between Purple Moon Holy Land and East Emperor Holy Land…

“North True! Scram!”

“North True, you think you are able to stop the three of us?”

“Get lost!”

“Eternal True God! Go, get him away.”

At the cabin doors, Purple Moon Holy Land and the Divine Eye Clan joined forces. The three universe supreme masters were doing their best to lay siege to North True Star Master. The universe supreme masters of the Divine Eye Clan… Every single one of them owned a miniature universe. The power that each possessed was extraordinary. Furthermore, Second True Master and Seventh True Master were also skilled in concerted moves.

North True Star Master might not have been afraid, but he could only hold out for that short moment before he was blasted away.

******

Luo Feng and a couple hundred great beings were hard at work, trying their best to comprehend the Rhinoceros Emperor Game, and, not surprisingly, Luo Feng and Deer Bug Master were the few who were faster.

As for the other universe knights and undying godly souls who had come over, their speed of comprehension was much slower—especially a handful of undying godly spirits, who, although they were already briefed by the other universe masters of the same race about the rules of the Rhinoceros Emperor Game, were still unable to grasp a full understanding of it.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

From where Monster Cuello was, there were bouts of energy ripples being transmitted over.

Luo Feng was aware of it. Most likely, this would be another large batch of newcomers.

“So many have come, but in the end, only one can receive the inheritance.”

Luo Feng sighed. Madness, the clans had all gone mad.

After a long while, a mighty group of a couple hundred figures flew over. At first glance, a majority consisted of undying godly souls from Purple Moon Holy Land! As for the overall number of universe knights and universe masters, Purple Moon Holy Land seemed to have the same number as the Divine Eye Clan, which was also similar to East Emperor Holy Land Universe, or probably only short by two. But if Deer Bug Master was added to the headcount, then Purple Clan Holy Land would, on the contrary, be at an advantageous position.

“This is the most basic rule.” Deer Bug Master took one look and started telling the latecomers discreetly.

Hazy light rays started to gather.

The light rays gave form to a green-haired man. He had eyes that were peaceful like the ocean, and as his gaze swept the 1,000-plus candidates present, he said, “Those who have come later, this is the last test before moving on to the next hall. It is a test on your comprehension. This is my hometown. It is a game that is most widely spread. It should not be seen simply as a game, but rather, as an important means to help you hone and cultivate your comprehension. He can test and increase your comprehension, and he is given the name—Rhinoceros Emperor Game!

Duan Dong River gave a slow and elaborate introduction.

“Let’s begin. Within a limited time, those whose decoding progress has reached my minimal requirement may enter the next hall.” Duan Dong River scanned the room with a cold look. “Do not underestimate this Rhinoceros Emperor Game… The four who came the earliest—humph! Up until now, only the human was able to perfectly decode the 124th endgame. The other three are still too slow. If this goes on—humph…!”

Duan Dong River shook his head and laughed coldly. Then he vanished into thin air.

The moment his words were heard, almost simultaneously, over 1,000 candidates present—from the Divine Eye clan, the Purple Moon Holy Land, the East Emperor Holy Land, and the other groups of powers—all looked over at Luo Feng!

Luo Feng’s expression changed slightly, too. “That loathsome Duan Dong River. This is pure malice. How could he? How could he utter such words?”

“Attack this human! So that he cannot focus on comprehending!”

“Attack.”

“Attack this human.”

Deer Bug Master and Shadow Witch Couple stood afar wordlessly with distant looks on their faces. As for the Divine Eye clan, Purple Moon Holy Land, and East Emperor Holy Land, all three had sent two to three universe masters out almost at the same time to launch attacks on Luo Feng. Duan Dong River might have given instructions for them to work on comprehending, but he did not forbid killing during the process of comprehending.
