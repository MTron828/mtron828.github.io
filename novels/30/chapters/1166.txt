Chapter 1167: Attraction from the Wing

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

On top of Tilted Peak Sector, the giant rocks flew several times faster than light, and three beings gathered, all of them glowing.

“Imperial didn’t leave any message when he died,” said a great being of Divine Eye clan. “I can’t even imagine the danger he ran into. Even if it’s in the inner area, few places could render Imperial Master unable to leave a message. It’s normal only at the center of Tilted Peak Sector.”

“Yes, it’s indeed very dangerous this time.”

“We shall follow the order from the first true master, and once we find somewhere dangerous or strange, we’ll report it immediately.”

“I’m just afraid that our efforts will be in vain. Chances are Imperial didn’t even die in the area specified.”

“That’s right.”

“That’s the area that was specified days before Imperial died. He might have died in the area around it, and chances are he died in the inner area.”

“Doesn’t matter. Just follow the order. I’ll be responsible for this area; An Yong, that one; Time Banishing, that one.”

“Okay.”

Hua! Hua! Hua!

They dispersed.

******

The area was too large, and there were countless creatures such as water flow spirits. None of the powers dared to claim that they had inspected the entire water area, and the water area would change as time went by.

After six days…

“I’ve finished.”

“Me too.”

“No one.”

Three universe masters met. They looked at each other, but no one had found anything. What should they do?

“One reference area is too large. We use domain type true treasure for inspection, and each time, we can inspect several light years,” said An Yong Master. “Though it’s fast, we can’t find the real lands of valuables.”

“Of course we know. Then what should we do? Go in there one by one?”

“However? It’ll take forever to walk one light year. An area one light year long, one light year wide, and one light year tall… how long will it take?”

The inspection wasn’t flying. Imperial inspected those caves carefully and got out if he didn’t find any valuables. He walked slowly across the caves, cracks, and woods. It would take more than 10,000 eras to finish one light year. And it would take far more than 100 million eras to finish the entire era.

“We can’t do a detailed inspection. We can only do a brief one.”

“Let’s report it back.”

“Okay.”

“Keep inspecting!” ordered First True Master. “It’s been a long time since Imperial died in that reference area. And he might have left the area before he died. Keep searching. Inspect all the areas around reference area 193293.”

“Yes,” replied An Yong Master obediently.

They wouldn’t resist, not even for a brief inspection. It took another few years for them to inspect the 100 nearby areas. They acquired senior true treasure weapons by luck and found two strange places. However, when the Sixth True Master arrived, he didn’t find anything.

“What a waste of time.”

“Who knows where Imperial died? Perhaps in the inner area!”

It was in vain. The Divine Eye clan did thorough research as well. They first inspected the water area, then researched whether the true treasure Imperial Master had appeared in the hands of the great beings of other races. The Sixth True Master went there directly… However, they could only admit failure in the end. They didn’t gain anything.

Usually, the Divine Eye race wouldn’t just give up if its great beings were killed! However, they couldn’t find anything this time, so they could only deal with it. An Yong Master, Time Banishing Master, and Replenishment Master separated from one another.

Time Banishing Master and Replenishment Master left while An Yong Master kept going deeper in the water area.

“I met Imperial before he died, and he seemed to have gotten something in the water area,” said An Yong Master. “It’s likely that he died in the water area, I’ll keep inspecting in reference system 193293.”

12 years had passed since Imperial Master died. Luo Feng flew in the space, and he looked at the waterfall on the towering Tilted Peak Sector.

“Tilted Peak Sector is said to be one of the three Lands of Extremis. It’s been 30 years since I came here, and I haven’t run into any danger.”

Hong! Long! Long!

The giant waterfall was tens of millions of light years high, and each drop of water could rival a star. How powerful the entire waterfall was! If all the water was concentrated to one point, even universe supreme masters could be killed! While separated, the water at the bottom kept changing under the churning and crashing.

“I’ll go to the main mountain of Tilted Peak Sector. I’ll just stay on top. It’s not going to be dangerous if I don’t go in.”

Luo Feng kept teleporting himself.

Shua! Shua! Shua!

He kept approaching that mountain… And it was the first time he arrived at the main body of Tilted Peak Sector.

After 30 million light years of teleportation, Luo Feng was pretty close to the main mountain.

“Huh?”

Shua!

Luo Feng stopped in the sky. In front of him was the main mountain of Tilted Peak Sector. However, Luo Feng frowned and looked down. “How? My Shi Wu Wings?”

He looked back at his Shi Wu Wings, which were intermittently trembling.

Summoning!

It was like magnets attracting each other. His Shi Wu Wings seemed to be attracted toward something.

“It’s a weak call. Which direction is it? The deep of water area?”

Luo Feng looked down and frowned. He wasn’t inexperienced. Tian Yang Knight’s “Light Wings” had previously attracted his wing, but that attraction had been incredibly strong. This attraction, however, was feeble.

Is the third wing down there? Luo Feng wondered. I’ll go check.

Sou!

Luo Feng teleported himself ten light years.

“Much stronger.” Luo Feng’s eyes gleamed, and his Shi Wu Wings started to tremble heavily. Apparently, the summon was strong. “Down.”

Luo Feng teleported himself again.

Hong!

He entered the shallow water.

Hong! Long! Long!

His Shi Wu Wings started to shake intensely.

“Such strong summoning!”

Luo Feng was exhilarated. He performed Golden Country. The dim light permeated and formed a blurry golden light area with a diameter of 10 light years. Of course, this wasn’t the limit of Golden Country, but Luo Feng didn’t dare teleport himself too far in the dangerous water area.

Shua!

Luo Feng moved three light years forward and entered the danger zone. He could only teleport himself a little bit farther in the deep water zone.

Shua! Shua! Shua!

Following the summoning, he went forward. However, he moved 100 million kilometers forward each time.

“It has to be a component of the Shi Wu Wings,” said Luo Feng. “Hahaha! I knew it. I know there were other components. I didn’t expect to find them in the outer area of Tilted Peak Sector.”

Luo Feng was exhilarated. When he found the true treasure wing of Tian Yang Knight, the found that the third level of engravings wasn’t complete. Apparently, there were other components.

He’d thought that they may have been taken by other great beings in Universe Ocean. After all, many great beings had wing valuables, and chances were, the great beings who acquired a true treasure wing might give it to a universe knight, as they thought it wasn’t powerful enough. Another possibility was that it had been left in Tilted Peak Sector…

I can’t believe I sense it so easily, thought Luo Feng. Is it on a great being, or just resting in place somewhere?

Luo Feng flew quickly, and he landed in front of a cave.

“It’s inside. It’s coming from the inside.”

Luo Feng looked at the cave and started to move inside carefully. The cave was enormous.

Weng! Weng! Weng!

Shi Wu Wing trembled intensely, and Luo Feng even needed to suppress it with his godly power.

“The summoning power is too strong… much stronger than last time,” Luo Feng whispered. “Is it because my Shi Wu Wings are complete?”

Luo Feng felt confused. After more than three hours, Luo Feng saw the screen of light in the distance.

“A light screen?”

Luo Feng got close carefully and looked at the light screen in the distance. Although the Shi Wu Wings on his back were trying to fly off of him, Luo Feng was still calm and cautious.

“Something’s wrong. Very wrong.”

Luo Feng frowned. “If Shi Wu Wings have another component, and that component doesn’t have an owner, it should fly toward me. On the other hand, if the component has an owner, he should also be able to feel the attraction. Isn’t he curious?” Luo Feng looked to the light screen. “Based on what I know about Tilted Peak Sector, only special valuables will lead to light screens like this one.”

As for ordinary to top-tier true treasures, they would be randomly placed in a corner.

“A light screen and a summoning from Shi Wu Wings,” said Luo Feng. “That component isn’t flying toward me.”

Although Luo Feng desperately wanted to get this component, he didn’t dare to venture forward. He knew how dangerous Tilted Peak Sector was.

“This is so strange. I’ll let my Mosha body get in first.”

Luo Feng decided quickly. In the past years, every time he ran into something weird, he let his Mosha body go first.

Shua!

Mosha body appeared and flew forward. He touched the light screen and entered.
