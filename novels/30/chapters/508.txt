Night.

Luo Feng brought little Na Ke and rushed into the sky. Na Ke couldn’t help but look back down at Swallow mound city, as tears were flowing from his eyes.

“Na Ke, sleep, sleep, once you awake it’ll be ok.” Luo Feng gently said. His voice had an unbelievable amount of power, Na Ke could only feel his entire being drift into a blur as his eyes closed and he fell asleep.

“Now that he’s asleep, there’s less trouble.” Luo Feng rushed into the skies breaking through the many levels of clouds.

In one breath he rushed to the 18th level. Any higher and he would leave Blood river world.

With a thought, a silver pyramid appeared beside and Luo Feng carried little Na Ke into the universe ship.

Within the control room.

He placed Na Ke into a resting room for him to sleep in, Luo Feng then came to the control room.

“This is Blood river continent’s map. Babata, help me take a look and tell me where the coordinates of the ancient god ruins are.” Luo Feng’s consciousness connected to Babatas. Babata quickly calculated, returning to Luo Feng the area of coordinates, that territory belonged to the ancient god ruins region.

Even with any errors, it wouldn’t be too far away.

“Let’s head out towards the ancient god ruins! We’ll proceed 16 billion km and stop.” Luo Feng gave the order to the automaton ship. Actually the AI of the automaton ship…was a subsidiary AI that Babata had created. Under normal circumstances, it could perfectly control the ship.

However when it was times of crisis, Babata would take over and control the automaton ship with the optimum control.

“Yes, master.” The ships AI responded.

Sou!

The ship soared through the clouds and swiftly flew in space.

“External simulation 100%.” Luo Feng ordered.

Immediately before him a simulation of the space outside showed. One side was space while the other was the outermost layer of clouds from Blood river world.

“The vast blood river continent.” Luo Feng looked at the continent from space. “Yet no one dares to leave the cloud levels, the strength of the Virtual Universe Company is… too strong!”

“Babata, help me prepare a file for nurturing Na Ke. I cannot accompany him, I can only arrange for the best for him.” Luo Feng sighed. Babata’s voice resounded in the control room, “This little matter, you have quite a few treasures on you, plus the many others the dead domain lords gave you. Nurturing a little punk is very easy.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After a while.

Luo Feng acquired a detailed nurturing plan for Na Ke.

As Luo Feng sat in the automaton ship, it was swiftly flying in the space above blood river world.

A silver black marked disc shaped universe ship with a diameter of 180 m appeared in the 16th cloud level above Swallow mound city.

Hua!

The leader of the group was dressed in black armor. His blue hair was floating about and his eyes seemed vast and boundless. Behind him were four purple armored men and women. They all hid their strength, revealing only domain lord level power. ”I wish to know, just who has such guts! To kill my disciple in my territory!” The blue long haired black armored man’s eyes were like lightning, shooting down below. Even the cloud layers below split apart from his gaze, allowing him to easily see the tiny Swallow mound city below.

“Let’s go down!” The blue haired man said coldly.

“Yes.” Behind him the four purple armored domain lords followed respectfully. These 5 shot down like lightning, and the floating universe ship behind them vanished.

……

After a short period of time.

Within the city leader’s mansion, even though a part of it was already destroyed, the city leader’s mansion was even larger than the Pure feather family mansion. Hence, a large portion of it was still perfectly undamaged. In one of the palaces…whether it was Swallow Mound’s families, sect, army, information system and so on, all the department heads and brains had all arrived.

Silence!

The palace was completely silent. That formless pressure caused the group of prominent figures to perspire from their foreheads, and kneel respectfully on the ground, because they knew the man before them was…

The world city leader!

The leader of this side of the world!

“Your city leader Rock Wind Xiong is dead!” The blue haired black armored man sat above and said coldly. The group below him were stunned. “The two envoys from the undying shrine passing by Swallow mound city are dead too!”

The group below was even more shocked.

They really didn’t know!

“The murderer is him!” The blue haired man waved his hand and immediately a bunch of paper floated onto the ground. On every piece was a picture of a black fully armored silhouette with boots and helmet, that was using a 6 edged shield and blood shadow blade. Actually, this picture…was simply a screenshot from the footage that was sent.

“Murderer?” A group of people looked at the paper.

“The face has been blocked? Wearing black armor, everyone wears black armor around. How do we look for him?” The group were suspicious and helpless. “If he changes his look after killing them, how will we look for him?”

“We can confirm that he is a pinnacle domain level warrior.” The blue haired man said coldly. “Activate all your resources. Go look and check if any suspicious domain level warrior appeared in Swallow mound city within this past period.”

“Yes!”

The group knelt down.

“I want to get a report before daylight tomorrow.”

“Yes.”

The group left after. The blue haired man stood in the palace and was looking outside through the window as though he was looking at space. “To have the guts to kill my, Si Yong’s disciple,and to steal my blood river crystals. Hmph!” A cold snort resounded within the silent palace.

The Automaton ship was flying in the space above Blood river world. It began to slow down after about 22 hours.

“Master, we’ve already reached 16 billion km away.” The voice resounded within the control room.

“Hm.” Luo Feng nodded.

He went into the resting room and carried the sleeping Na Ke. He swiftly followed the pathway within to the cabin door of the ship. He then kept the ship and headed down towards through the blood river atmosphere.

Rumble!

Rushing through the 18th, 17th, 16th levels…

“Na Ke.” Luo Feng shouted.

“Hm.” Only then did Na Ke wake up. He looked at where he was floating in mid air, as he was carried by a formless energy, and before him stood Luo Feng.

“Big brother feng.” He was fully awake only now.

“Follow me down.” Luo Feng brought Na Ke, swiftly breaking through the 1st level of clouds, causing Na Ke to be shocked as it was still late night. Blood river world’s night was 6 to 7 times longer than a night of earth, and the distance of 16 billion km, caused the region below to look close to the time they left Swallow mound city.

Luo Feng brought Na Ke into the closest city. This city was called Meng Na city. It had an area of 10 million km, the side of the world they were in was called Yu Rong World.

……

“This Meng Na city is actually in Yu Rong world and is about 10 worlds apart from the Si Rong world before.” Na Ke was very shocked. “Big brother Feng, how long have I been asleep?”

“Relax, not even 30 days.” Luo Feng said.

Blood river world’s 30 days was about half a year earth’s time.

In truth, Na Ke had only slept for over 20 hours. However he would never know. With blood river continent’s different world’s attacking each other, plus it being simply too vast, there was no uniform timeline.

“Not even 30 days? That’s good.” Na Ke nodded. “I heard from many warriors that travelling 10 worlds would require a long amount of time.”

……

After settling down for a day in Meng Na city, Luo Feng placed Na Ke in that city’s Rain Blade sect. The leader of the sect personally welcomed the both of them.

“This is the punk I told you about, I’m leaving him here in your sect. When I finish my training, I will return to take him. When that time comes, I will naturally thank you.” Luo Feng looked at the Rain Blade sect leader before him. The leader nodded, “Relax, this little matter won’t be a problem!”

The leader of the sect was a skinny yet intrepid old man. As a cloud level (universe level) warrior, he was a prominent figure in Meng Na city.

However Luo Feng’s arrival last night had indeed shocked this old man. “This black haired youth, his power is beyond my comprehension, and I have no resistance before him. He should be a domain level warrior, and he’s really generous. To be on good terms with such an absolute warrior, that’s extremely lucky!”

At this time.

Na Ke began to stay in the Yu Rong world’s Meng Na city, Rain blade sect.

“Na Ke!”

“Your study of the bow and arrow before shows that your spirit energy is indeed strong. These are the spirit reader training techniques I have prepared for you.” Luo Feng took out a thick book, it was something Babata had printed using this world’s paper. Using this world’s words, a training manual for a spirit reader, from basic to deep had been created.

Actually, this was something only the elite disciples of the Yun Mo Planet could study.

“This training manuals, as long as you can study it, you can use it until you become an undying spirit.” Luo Feng said.

“Big brother Feng.” Na Ke looked surprised at the book before him. My god, the many worlds of Blood river continent were all fighting for valuable things. This manual that worked from star traveller level to undying, just how valuable was it.

“These are several suggestions I’ve prepared for you.” Luo Feng took out a thin book. “In it I’ve put down on how to use the treasures to enhance your training efficiency.”

“These are some treasures.” Luo Feng handed over a space ring.

“Using these treasures, as long as you train seriously, you can definitely become cloud level without any problem. As long as you work extra hard, you have the possibility of becoming domain level (domain lord). As for proceeding further, that’ll depend on yourself.” Luo Feng smiled at Na Ke.

Na Ke was shocked.

It was a gift from the heavens…

As long as he seriously trained, he could become cloud level (universe level)? Looking at the leader of the Rain blade sect, to be able to open a sect in a city, cloud level…this was definitely an absolute warrior in this city.

“Thanks, thanks.” Na Ke was so excited his eyes were red.

Luo Feng smiled.

What was this?

Back then, his teacher, the master of the Yun Mo Planet had prepared treasures for him to rush to the domain lord and even sector lord level! As long as he didn’t worry about the price, he could completely nurture a universe, domain lord and sector lord. Of course the price worth was simply too low. For example, the cost of creating a universe level alone could actually be used to buy an army of slave universe levels!

This Na Ke, was an aboriginal of Blood river world. He was born as a star traveller, plus with this world’s environment…his innate ability was much stronger than Luo Feng back then.

Luo Feng had only prepared some treasures enough to nurture him to cloud level!

“I know you really wish to return!”

“But remember!”

“Before cloud level, I definitely won’t allow you to return.” Luo Feng emphasized. “Travelling 10 worlds is simply too dangerous. Without the strength of a cloud level, that will simply be suicide.”

“Hm!” Na Ke nodded.

Luo Feng smiled, “Alright, whatever I’ve given you, don’t tell another soul.”

“That I know.” Na Ke was from a business family. Naturally he knew the outcome of revealing the treasures.

“Haha, I’m leaving.”

Luo Feng smiled and turned, vanishing from sight, leaving only Na Ke there.

Na Ke grabbed the thick book in his hands, flipping it open, the words on every page were very small, and the amount of information within was shocking.

“Father, you were right, this opportunity is a big one!” Na Ke kept the book in his space ring and his eyes were filled with resolve. “I will definitely train until I get strong, definitely!”
