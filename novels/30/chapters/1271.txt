Chapter 1272: Sixth-Tier As the Top

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Within Black Prison Tower, amidst the quiet space that was filled with black haze, two figures were rapidly sucked in. One was a tumbling sky wolf, and the other was an Ink Scepter beast—a three-tailed beast that was covered in scales and had three horns on its head. One was Sky Wolf Master; the other was Ink Scepter Master. Both of them were truly ancestral figures among the demons, yet at that moment, both were imprisoned.

“Not good.” Sky Wolf Master blinked. Just a moment ago, it had awoken from its illusion to give a sudden shout of objection.

Ink Scepter Master, who was by its side, was also frantic. “Sky Wolf, what should we do? We—we have been imprisoned in that supreme true treasure Black Prison Tower!” Ink Scepter Master was panicking.

“Black Prison Tower…” Sky Wolf Master looked around anxiously.

The space ripples in here were totally cut off from the outside world. Teleportation? God country transportation? No. There was no way they could escape.

“I… I don’t have any other bodies,” Sky Wolf Master said, on edge.

Done! This was truly a nightmare. It was needless to mention that for a universe supreme master to be imprisoned in this supreme true treasure palace, there would be simply no chance for escape. If the two of them had other bodies, then there would be nothing much to fret over. Yet neither Sky Wolf Master nor Ink Scepter Master were highly ranked demon universe masters. Neither had any other bodies.

If they did, then their status would naturally have been different. Even if they were suppressed within a supreme true treasure palace, with other bodies elsewhere, they could have simply self-destructed right away! That way, even if they lost their precious true treasures in the process of self-destruction, at least they could have ensured their survival!

“Wait!” Sky Wolf Master shouted. “We will wait for our chance! Dream Demon Ancestor is still out there. We still have a chance. I believe that Shock Demon Ancestor will rush over soon. By that time, our Ancestors just have to snatch this Black Prison Tower away from the humans. Then we can get out of here.”

“Right, right.” Ink Scepter Master was at his wits’ end. There was only this way out now. “Dream Demon Ancestor and Shock Demon Ancestor will surely come to our rescue!”

“No!”

“Loathsome!”

Just as the demon universe masters were howling and Dream Demon Ancestor—who had rushed over at such a transcendent speed of flight—was roaring with rage, their enemy, the humans, were—on the contrary—exhilarated. Peng Gong Master, Darkness Master, Luo Feng, and a large group of universe masters were all smiles, and they were so happy that their heartfelt joy was second to none.

“The basic target has been achieved!” Peng Gong Master exclaimed excitedly when they were back within the virtual universe. “We have exterminated one universe master, caught two universe masters: Sky Wolf Master and Ink Scepter Master, who are mere nobodies among the demons, so they are unable to escape no matter how they try.”

“It takes such a long time for a rare occurrence of a universe master’s annihilation, yet today, the demons lost three to us in an instant. If news gets out, those minor groups whose powers do not match up to the demons will naturally be scared out of their wits. We are able to cause the demons to lose three universe masters before their most powerful great being, Dream Demon Ancestor, so when it comes to dealing with those minor groups, exterminating them in one swift move should be a piece of cake!”

“That’s right.”

“Our basic target has been achieved. Now, we can kill and capture as we please. The more we kill or capture, the more effectively it will work out for us.”

Luo Feng, Peng Gong, and Darkness were all very excited. The human race had Black Prison Tower and Yan Jun Rod. On top of these, they also had Luo Feng’s treasure! This enabled the entire race to have three sixth-tier universe masters. Even though they might lose out in terms of speed, in the overall battle—or at least when facing the demons one-to-one—they still had an edge over the demons. But Luo Feng and the rest were aware that the inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River was destined to attract various powers.

The human race would have to face not only the demons but many other groups, which was why they were under extreme pressure. If Dream Demon Ancestor alone could be so scary, what if there were three such figures approaching them? Or five universe supreme masters? Most likely, one joint attack would sweep them away. Who knew? Maybe even Peng Gong Master would be sealed and suppressed.

Regardless of the final outcome of this war, Luo Feng thought silently, From the very beginning, we will give our best in fighting the demons… Not only is this the first battle, but it is the battle of deterrence. We must unleash our best to deter the other powers from attacking. We have to let them think that there is possible danger behind them.

If the humans seemed weak on the outside, the other groups would worry that the humans would be quickly defeated and would go under. Then it would be too late for them to reap any benefits, so they would all surge forward for the kill.

But if the humans appeared to be terrifying, those groups would, firstly, be unwilling to pay such a hefty price and, secondly, not be worried that the human race would be completely defeated by the demons, the automaton race, and the bug clan. Instinctively, they would just watch the show from the sidewalk. So long as the human race was given the chance for a breather… everything was possible! After all, as Luo Feng had explained to the other universe masters earlier on, this concerned all universe masters and universe supreme masters.

There was a possibility that at the critical moment, Darkness Master, Peng Gong Master, and Primal Chaos City Leader might just achieve a breakthrough. Once there was a breakthrough, the human race would have a greater chance.

“If I were to achieve a breakthrough from a universe master, the situation would be greatly different,” Luo Feng said silently to himself. “Now, only my original earthling body and golden horned beast body have extremely strong combat power. The moment I achieve a breakthrough from a universe master, Mosha body and Remote Ocean body will all possess the sixth-tiered combat power. By then, the situation for the human race will be greatly improved.”

Sixth-tier was the top. In the original universe, it was the strongest combat power possible! Reaching the level of sixth-tier was difficult. It usually required a fifth-tier top universe master with a supreme true treasure to achieve this top level! The human race only had a total of three fifth-tier top universe masters (Darkness, Peng Gong, and Primal Chaos City Leader), so even if there were two to three more supreme true treasures for the other universe masters like Ice Mountain Master and Long Yan Master, they would not be able to unleash the power that a sixth-tier top universe master could.

Luo Feng had been lacking in his law comprehension earlier on, so even though he had Star Tower, he could still only unleash an extremely small portion of its power.

Great being and true treasure had to come in a pair! This was the only way to achieve the sixth-tier combat power. Luo Feng was different, he had created “Nirvana Renaissance,” which was a secret technique at the level of a universe supreme master, so even without a supreme true treasure, he would still be able to unleash combat power that was at the level of a sixth-tier top universe master!

“Dream Demon Ancestor is charging this way.”

“That old fellow.”

The human race spotted Dream Demon Ancestor, who was charging toward them at an extremely crazy speed.

“I will stop him,” Luo Feng said. “Peng Gong and Darkness, both of you can continue dealing with that group of demons universe masters. Try hard to apprehend a few more.”

“All right.”

“All right.”

Peng Gong and Darkness had seen Luo Feng’s ability earlier on. They had the utmost confidence in him.

Hua!

Behind Luo Feng, the four silver wings suddenly expanded. Then, mightily, as though they could cover half of the entire starlit sky, they brought Luo Feng up into midair where he was suspended with Blood Ghost Blade in his grip. His eyes were fixated on Dream Demon Ancestor, who was charging over at an extremely fast rate with murderous intention. At that moment, Dream Demon Ancestor was behaving like a lunatic, letting out piercing screams of rage: “Luo Feng!”

“Go!”

With a move of his mind—

Hong!

A gigantic Boat of Mausoleum appeared in midair and collided head-on with Dream Demon Ancestor, who was charging over at top speed and had no intention of slowing down at all. Because the Boat of Mausoleum had just been taken out, its internal engine was just starting to churn and retreated a little upon the impact of the collision. Right away, Luo Feng waved and retrieved the Boat of Mausoleum.

“Loathsome humans!” Dream Demon Ancestor was still crazily in pursuit after the collision. It was simply too furious.

Hua!

Dream Demon Ancestor’s snakehead opened its mouth wide.

Xiu!

A cyan-colored shadow flashed past the length of the sky and skimmed toward Luo Feng.

Hu!

In an instant, Luo Feng waved Blood Ghost Blade firmly in his grip, and a thin blade ray was formed. It grew in size, and eventually, a large, black miniature universe was formed over that cyan shadow. The miniature universe split open. Streams of blade rays appeared in thin flashes to disappear the next moment. The cyan shadow, on the other hand, flew as fast as it could back into Dream Demon Ancestor’s widely opened mouth.

The two merely exchanged blows once. Dream Demon Ancestor kept his eyes on Luo Feng.

“What an impressive blade technique. A supreme true treasure I suppose?” Dream Demon Ancestor was deep in thought, devising a way to deal with Luo Feng. It realized that Luo Feng’s blade ray had an extremely terrifying penetrating power! If the defining characteristic of Yan Jun Rod’s power could be described as “massive,” then Luo Feng’s blade’s defining characteristic could be described as “sharp.” It was indescribably sharp!

The four wings at Luo Feng’s back spread out as he looked at Dream Demon Ancestor. Sixth tier was the top. It was, indeed, the limit as to how much power could be released within this original universe.

“My execution of Nirvana Renaissance has started to vaguely feel some obstruction,” Luo Feng said discreetly to himself. “I had not expected this so-called limit of the sixth-tier to not exert its influence not only over universe supreme masters, but also over universe knights and universe masters.”

Prior to this, within the entire original universe, there was not a single sixth-tier universe master. Even if there was a supreme true treasure, it would be owned by a universe supreme master!

At that moment, Luo Feng, Darkness and Peng Gong were all of the sixth-tier standard, and even so, they could still feel that layer of obstruction.

“Yes.”

“This imposed restriction is the suppression exerted by the willpower of the original universe over universe supreme masters, so that they were unable to achieve massive and mindless massacres,” Luo Feng whispered to himself. “But it was not so strong as to be able to make these universe supreme masters weaker than universe masters! This is why, even for universe masters, the greatest power they could unleash was only to the limit of the sixth tier as the top.”

Previously, there were many rumors but no truths to back them up. Luo Feng, Darkness, and Peng Gong had all become “sixth-tier as the top” universe masters, so they could clearly detect it. No way there could be a breakthrough, because once they got near, the obstruction they felt was far too great.

“Theoretically, for a true universe master, the sixth tier is the limit,” Luo Feng said to himself. “This is the case in the original universe, which is, in fact, considered quite an achievement. But I… am different from them, which is why I am always at a loss.”

Generations of reincarnation eras… Finally, there was a unique existence like Luo Feng, who had received the inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River! Because he had Blood Ghost Blade! With Blood Ghost Blade, his power was elevated by one level!

Extermination—created by three generations of ancestors. Once executed, his power would increase even more!

So, if there was no obstruction, Luo Feng would now have really given his all, used Extermination, and unleashed a seventh-tier combat power (within the Universe Ocean, it was the power of an ordinary universe supreme master). If he was able to reach the level of a universe master, then he would be able to unleash an eighth-tier combat power!

What a pity that the original universe might be able to suppress the universe supreme masters. But they were unable to suppress them to the extent that they would lose out against universe masters. After all, within Universe Ocean, Dream Demon Ancestor’s combat power was close to the eighth-tier standard, whereas the maximum within the original universe was limited to sixth-tier combat power.

“Human, you loathsome fellow!” Dream Demon Ancestor roared. “If this was Universe Ocean, do you think you would be my match?”

With his hand grasping Blood Ghost Blade, Luo Feng gave a cold laugh and said, “That was what Virtual Real Devil God once said to Double-Face Ancestral God. What a pity, indeed, that this is the original universe we are in!”

Luo Feng and Dream Demon Ancestor had only just started to exchange blows when, far into the distance, where the demon universe masters were besieged, there was a sudden outburst of terrifying power. From within that palace supreme true treasure beside Prohibition Master, a beast with a serrated shell over its body was suddenly seen slowly crawling out of that palace true treasure.

Right away, the demon universe masters shouted in excitement, “Shock Demon Ancestor!”
