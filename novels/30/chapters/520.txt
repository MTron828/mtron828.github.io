“Isn’t becoming a black warrior extremely hard?” Luo Feng was curious, asking, “From the books I’ve read, becoming a black warrior is almost simply a legend. However, to become a blood warrior, people still have some hope.”

“But of course.” The tall blood god guard laughed loudly, “Black warrior, that is the pride of our Blood River continent. Only after an immeasurable amount of time will one be born. And it’s been very very long since we’ve had a black warrior. Afterall, absorbing the blood river crystals, every one would have an increased requirement of ten times from before, and every person’s body has a limit. After a certain extent…the killing aura of the Ancient God ruins won’t have any use on the body. At that time, then that’d be no hope.”

Luo Feng was shocked.

Limit?

Right, he had only absorbed 2 crystals currently, and the killing aura was still benefitting his body. However one’s body would have a limit afterall. When that is reached, even staying in the Ancient God ruins wouldn’t be effective at all.

“Let’s hope that my body can take more.” Luo Feng thought.

“Come, 97. Let me introduce you.” The tall blood god guard walked towards the others. “I am the captain of the guards, number 1. You’ll call me captain from now on. This is number 2, the vice captain.”

“97.”

“How do you do 97.”

The many bronze armored warriors walked up to introduce themselves to Luo Feng, because they were all clear that the title of blood god guards were the closest guard team to the Blood God. They were like his right arms. In the future, their group would go through thick and thin together. Hence, they had to get close and be on good terms with each other. Afterall, they would become life and death brothers.

“97, you are the smallest.”

“Small and young.”

“Haha, 73, don’t look down on 97. This 97 is the only cloud level that has been allowed in.”

“You bunch of punks. 97, he even killed a blood demon. According to the levels of the outsiders, that is a domain lord level 1 blood demon.” The blood god captain Number 1 laughed loudly. “Their levels are ten times different, and that blood demon has even stepped through the laws gateway. However, 97 still won so simply. In terms of origin law comprehension, most of us don’t even compare to him.”

Immediately the group of guards all looked shocked at Luo Feng.

Luo Feng was shocked within.

One of the reason was because the captain knew of the term domain lord and the levels. The second reason was because he actually knew that Luo Feng had won easily against the blood demon, knowing that the demon had also stepped through the entrance of the origin laws.

And the lord before hadn’t spoken much in detail before too.

“Looks like, my battle before had been completely monitored.” Luo Feng thought. “Right, him and the vice captain, are the considered to be right hand and left hand of the blood god. Them and the blood god Baqi were all sector lord level. Sector lords could use their world energy…the wonder of the world energy. This was something his earth body had yet to discover, it was normal.”

“97!”

The captain number 1 smiled at Luo Feng. “From now on, we are all life and death brothers, all blood god guards!”

“Hm.” Luo Feng nodded.

“Haha…come, follow me.” The captain looked at the others. “All of you return to your posts, go back to your training and whatever.”

“Yes, captain.”

“Understood, captain.”

“Little thing, we’ll chat next time.”

A group of bronze silhouettes spoke and became beams of lights heading in all directions.

……

The captain brought Luo Feng. They were walking along the bottom of the huge pit and talking along the way, “The Ancient God ruins is the most ancient and mysterious place of our Blood River continent. Back then, our ancient warriors of the continent defended against the outsiders here. The outsiders were extremely strong, you cannot even begin to imagine.”

“Ah?” Luo Feng was shocked. “Just how strong are the outsiders?”

“I don’t know either.” Number 1 shook his head. “Anyway they are just terrifying. Just imagine, back then many undying spirits fell in this Ancient God ruins. From this, you should already know how intense and tragic that battle was.”

“Enough about the outsiders, I need to warn you of…the Ancient God ruins! Don’t wander about alone here.” Number 1 emphasized. “The lord is training in his palace here. The duty of us blood god guards is to protect him, killing enemies around. As he is training here, naturally we are all training here in the ruins too.”

“Hm.” Luo Feng nodded.

Training in the Ancient God ruins was a good thing.

“However here in the ruins, there are many dangerous places. This huge pit is one of them.” Number 1 pointed into the sky. “Above, is the killing aura whirlpool. The aura at the whirlpool core is terrifying. The aura there will make one unable to resist, it’s terrifying.”

“Whirlpool?” Luo Feng pretended to be curious. In truth, he had already seen it before.

“Hm, this bottom and the top part of the pit, the aura is already thick enough.” Number 1 said shocked. “However the closer you get to the whirlpool core, the thickness grows even more. I’ve heard that in the core center, the thickness reaches close to 10 times!”

“Close to 10 times?” Luo Feng was truly shocked now.

Before, he had made it to a region of 8 times, he could already see with his naked eye the core center of the whirlpool, and did not dare to approach closer.

“Hm.” Number 1 emphasized. “It’s very dangerous there, even my willpower can at most take up to 5 times only. I’ve heard that our lord is able to reach a region of 7 times.”

“7 times?” Luo Feng thought, just weaker than himself.

However to be able to reach 7 times, this blood god Baqi was already named a genius from a trillion years on Blood River continent. In terms of pure willpower…Luo feng was already much stronger than many sector lord pinnacles.

“Hence, you have to be careful.” Number 1 emphasized. “The moment you rush in and get invaded by the killing aura willpower…you will become like the blood demon you defeated before.”

“Hm.” Luo Feng nodded seriously.

This huge pit is one of the dangers of the Ancient God ruins. such a place, there are probably millions of these in the entire ruins. All are incomparably dangerous places where the aura gathers.” Number 1 exclaimed. “There are also many other dangerous places that haven’t been discovered over countless years. Anyway, recklessly wandering about will be tragic.”

Luo Feng was shocked

Millions of such places?

“Follow me to the palace.” The captain became a beam of light.

Luo Feng followed.

Luo Feng looked ahead at this palace that was erected amidst the red aura. It was about 2 km in length and width, and was a total of 7 storeys tall.

“Come in.” The captain entered and Luo Feng followed.

Very quickly arriving at the 2nd level.

“Ah?” Luo Feng’s ears moved. Looking in the distant room, that door was open, from within it, weak howls resounded. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The captain looked at Luo Feng’s expression and explained. “That’s where we tame the blood demons.”

“Ah.” Luo Feng nodded.

Blood demons, also the mad warriors.

“Our blood god guard living quarters are on the 3rd level.” The captain arrived at the 3rd level and followed the pathway, simultaneously pointing at a 1m wide walkway, “Beside every room is a number, from 1 to 200. Right now, 96 of them are taken, yours will be 97!”

3rd level of the palace, room 97, the door automatically opened.

“Di!”

A green light shined on Luo feng who had just entered.

“This is?” Luo feng was shocked.

“Don’t be shocked. This is a quantum computer that manages the entire palace.” The captain smiled. “These quantum computers were acquired from the outsiders back from the Ancient God battles. However, creating these quantum computers was extremely hard. Even among the undying shrines, only the upper levels have it.”

“Ah.” Luo Feng gave a look of envy.

Quantum computers? There was plenty in the universe, one could buy as much as he wanted. And he had a living AI that was much better.

Room 97, it was 20m tall and 30m long and wide room.

“This is your genetic armor.” The captain pointed at a bunch of stuff neatly organized on the ground. “These genetic armors will defend you according to how strong your genetic energy is. Simultaneously, it will change according to your will and is able to seal up all vital areas. Even if broken, it can quickly regenerate. It’s a very advanced armor. Only very few in blood river continent have it.”

“Hm.” Luo feng stared at the bronze armor.

“This is a communication device!” The captain pointed at the bracelet beside. “Wear it, and through it, you can contact the other guards and the lord! Simultaneously…the lord will know where you are from it!”

Luo Feng hesitated a little.

Communication device?

Probably more of a surveillance device.

“The lord has ordered that no blood god guard, without the lord’s orders, can leave him more than 100k km. If one does so, he would be deemed a traitor and killed.” The captain stared at Luo Feng and emphasized. “You must always remember…the moment you betray the lord, with his future position in the undying shrine, there’s nowhere for you to run in the entire Blood River continent.”

“Understood.” Luo Feng nodded.

Boom!

Luo Feng felt the ground of the palace slightly tremble. Boom! Boom! Trembles resounded all over. It was a heavy sound, it almost felt like the footsteps of a giant that was nearby.

“Hm?” The captain was shocked too, quickly leaving the room.

Luo Feng followed out of the room into the walkway. With one look, he could see ahead of the 10m wide walkway, there was a 12m tall, 20m long 4 hooved beast. From its appearance, it was similar to the bull like animals of earth. The muscles on its body solid and wrapped all about. There were also two curved horns protruding from the top of its head.

Those hooves were as thick as water jars, sturdy and forceful.

Its entire body was bronze in color, and the eyes were blood red. The most peculiar thing was its horns, they were so sharp that it made hearts tremble. Just from its walking along the pathway alone, its horns seemed to tear through the air and shake the space.

“Lord Qi Niu.” Number 1 bowed.

“Hm!” That 4 storey tall beast Qi Niu gazed down at Luo Feng. A fierce energy emanated from him, “He’s the new 97?”

“Yes, Lord Qi Niu.” Number 1 said, simultaneously communicating to Luo Feng, “97, this beast Qi Niu…is even stronger than our lord. His position in the undying shrine is very high too. He’s like brothers with our lord.”

Luo Feng was stunned.
