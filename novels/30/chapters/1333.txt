Chapter 1335: A Long Time

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Feng had been reading it for half a month, and he sighed, shaking his head, “What a shame. A peerless great being just died like that. If he’d had more time, he could’ve transcended incarnation and created another holy land. Unfortunately, that last step… He got stuck at the last step.”

It was almost impossible to transcend incarnation. Otherwise, there would have been more holy lands.

“Jie Fanzi only comprehended the most basic material of Water and Fire Origins. He hadn’t even fully comprehended it. If he had, he might have transcended incarnation already. If someone’s able to comprehend further, he’ll be incredible. If someone can fully comprehend the whole thing…!” Luo Feng could help but exclaim. It was a powerful and special technique that pointed to the origin.

Actually, even turning from true gods (universe supreme masters) to high-level beings didn’t involve universe origin mysteries like life reproduction. Jie Fanzi had tried to study techniques that were far beyond his level, so he had failed. He studied it for three universe eras and still failed.

“However… Jie Fanzi’s technique offers a unique path. After I become a true god, this Water and Fire Origins will be helpful to me on fire and water when I try to transcend incarnations.”

Since Luo Feng had obtained the inheritance from Duan Dong River, he knew exactly what he should do. He would become a true god following the godly power path! After becoming a true god, he would use all the ten basic laws—gold, wood, water, fire, mud, light, thunder, wind, time, and space—to condense a void space.

Water and Fire Origin could help a bit as well. Actually, starting from all the ten basic laws was the most efficient way! It was easier to use all ten basic laws. As for Jie Fanzi, he only used fire and water, so he had encountered too many obstacles and had finally died.

Luo Feng had collected many crystal balls and valuables, at the same time, the mind in the virtual universe also told Primal Chaos City Leader that happy surprise.

“Luo Feng, are you saying that Jie Fanzi alone had 32 pinnacle true treasure palaces? And he had 91 ordinary pinnacle true treasures?” Primal Chaos City Leader was astonished. “We didn’t even get that many true treasures from Thunderstorm Star! That’s far too many!”

“Jie Fanzi was at top-tier level ten!” Luo Feng exclaimed. “He left those valuables because he wanted me to spread the inheritance.”

Undying fighters could already practice inheritance. As long as someone fully comprehended the water law and fire law, he could start comprehending Water and Fire Origins. Based on the records, it was possible to reach the level of a limit universe supreme master. As for transcending incarnations? Jie Fanzi hadn’t succeeded, so that task fell on the shoulders of future generations.

“Jie Fanzi left so many true treasures so that future generations could continue his inheritance. We’ll definitely help.”

There were only 20 universe masters in the human race. It was more than enough.

“However, there will be more and more universe masters in the human race,” said Primal Chaos City Leader. “We need to think about the future as well.”

“I’ll leave all that to you, Teacher.” Luo Feng smiled. “I’ll start practicing now and adventuring in the three Lands of Extremis. I’ll send those valuables back to the race shortly.”

A great being could only use a certain number of true treasures. Jie Fanzi had too many true treasures, so he could only leave them in the storage.

Luo Feng had obtained many true treasures this time, so he would leave several for himself, giving all four of his godly bodies better weapons and armors. However, he alone couldn’t use that many true treasures. He would rather leave them to his race, like Teacher Origin and Huge Axe Creator.

“I’ll start practicing now!” Luo Feng took a step forward and walked out of the green keepsake space. Then he started to tour the three Lands of Extremis by Boat of Mausoleum.

******

Time passed. 1,000 years, 10,000 years, 100,000 years…

Time passed silently, leaving no traces. During practice, a few thousand years was like a blink of an eye.

Boat of Mausoleum became a silver boat. Luo Feng took the silver boat to the Lands of Extremis. He was well aware that he couldn’t go too deep in the Lands of Extremis, so he only ventured into the inner area. Sometimes, he would tour around at the periphery of the core ground, but he wouldn’t go too deep.

Luo Feng’s chief intention was to practice rather than to adventure!

Tilted Peak Sector was mysterious and variable. Universe Boat was a machine type valuable, and there were billions of areas within it. There were still traces of an intact Universe Boat somewhere. But Flowing Level Mountain was like a maze.

Luo Feng went back to the original universe once to distribute the true treasures during his travels.

******

The 600,000th year after Luo Feng started to tour Universe Ocean, in Flowing Level Mountain.

Hong! Long! Long!

The water stretched through time and space, and on a stone amid the water stood three beings.

“It’s getting more and more dangerous!” a red rock life form roared. “A true treasure is about to be born.”

“We’ll see which one of us is more powerful after the true treasure is born.”

“It also depends on our power.”

All three universe masters were looking forward to it. They were all nervous, and there was dimming light around them. Apparently, there was a domain true treasure covering the entire area. However, the domain could only cover a certain area. It couldn’t cover the tumbling water. They couldn’t tell in advance when the true treasures would be born.

Hong! Long!

The water, which had been moving recklessly, suddenly started to move normally. The water started to gather and spin. It connected the sky and land, and there was a waterspout!

“It’s right there!”

All the universe masters burnt their godly power and put all their efforts.

Hong!

A white boat burst out of the waterspout, which astounded all three universe masters.

“It’s Milky Way Horde Leader!” shouted a black creature with many wrinkles on his face.

The rock great being and the double-faced, four-armed great being were both shocked—especially the double-faced, four-armed great being. He retreated into a palace true treasure and tried to run away.

A white boat? Rumor was spread through the three Lands of Extremis that a human universe master who drove a white boat had appeared in some places where true treasures were born and had seized the true treasures! The three Lands of Extremis were enormous, and true treasures could be born anywhere, yet Luo Feng had seized true treasures dozen of times. Luo Feng was as talented at seizing valuables as five universe supreme masters combined!

He was so efficient because of Boat of Mausoleum. He was able to enter some dangerous places and claim the true treasures when the great beings were still waiting outside.

The black creature with wrinkles and the rock life great being stood aside and glanced at the double-faced, four-armed being trying to flee. “Poor Yu Lan.”

Yu Lan Master was a universe master from Purple Moon Holy Land.

For the past 6,000 years, Milky Way Horde Leader had been journeying through the three Lands of Extremis. He sometimes appeared in Flowing Level Mountain, sometimes in Universe Boat, and other times in Tilted Peak Sector. He always showed up with a great shock. If he met a universe master from Purple Moon Holy Land, he would capture them immediately. Nobody knew whether he captured them or killed them.

In the 6,000 years after Luo Feng killed Pei Xing Master, he had captured three more universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land. Even though most universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land had returned to the holy land after the news, some universe masters were reluctant to retreat. Instead, they stayed out and simply tried to be careful.

“Yu Lan has being very careful, and he only showed up because a true treasure is about to be born. We didn’t expect that Milky Way Horde Leader would have his eyes on that true treasure as well… Milky Way Horde Leader must have been in the waters, so they couldn’t detect him. Now that he has emerged, it’s too late.”

The black, wrinkled creature and the rock life both sighed. Everyone knew that Milky Way Horde Leader wouldn’t attack universe masters if they didn’t mess with him. Milky Way Horde Leader only targeted those from Purple Moon Holy Land, the fire origin race, and the dragon rock race. Those from the fire origin race and the dragon rock race had already hidden in the miniature universes. Only those from Purple Moon Holy Land still dared to come out.

“Stop fighting, Yu Lan Master.” The white boat flew over, and a nine-story tower showed up and suddenly expanded. Yu Lan Master was trying to fly away from the abyss at the bottom of the tower.

Star Tower started to suck it in!

Yu Lan Master flew out of his true treasure palace and attempted to flee. “Milky Way Horde Leader, Milky Way Horde Leader! Purple Moon Holy Land won’t let you go! They never will!”

Luo Feng drove his Star Tower again and tried to absorb Yu Lan Master, who had previously targeted the true treasure palace.

“No!” Yu Lan Master tried to get out, but he was still being swallowed. He became smaller as he got closer to the bottom of Star Tower and then was completely swallowed.

A voice came from the white boat. “Two… Sorry, I’m passing by, but I’ll take the true treasure.”

The two universe masters standing at the top of the mountain were both humble. The white boat flew away.

******

The white boat became black once it flew away. Even its shape changed.

In the space of suppression of Star Tower, Yu Lan Master with two faces and four arms saw the three beings in the distance.

The other three universe masters from Purple Moon Holy Land saw Yu Lan and walked forward.

“Yu Lan! Why are you here?”

“Yu Lan! How were you captured?”

A white-caped being appeared in the space of suppression. It was a young man with black hair.

“Milky Way Horde Leader.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Luo Feng.”

All four universe masters, including Yu Lan, glared at him.

The white-caped man shook his head and sighed. “Don’t look at me like that. It’s not that I want to kill you. It’s that your ancestor refuses to save you. Don’t blame me.”
