Chapter 1251: Blade Name Blood Shadow

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The mountain of valuables was built by the three ancestral teachers, and it had many restrictions as well. Each inheritor owned a mark of inheritance, which was why they could take an embryo. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to do that.

“Ze Ze!” Luo Feng walked on the mountain of valuables and looked around. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The traces of light were so powerful that they could instantly kill universe supreme masters. However, with the special constraints of the mountain of valuables, each embryo was suppressed.

“Spiritual force weapons! Close combat weapons! Countless special weapons! This is a machine.”

Luo Feng looked around. There was an oval fortress which was as large as Universe Boat! This giant fortress had 18 levels of attack units, and the engravings on them were blank, which required users to fill them. There was also a special boat, and the boat was actually a world of manufacturing, which contained lots of conditions for making true treasures.

There was another golden embryo, which was Jie Mu Embryo. It was weak at the beginning, yet it had great potential. When it was cultivated, it could follow the path of the bug race to have a huge army, or to follow the elite path. Either way, it was much better than the Bug clan queen.

There was also a giant, human-shaped machine that could be used as armor! It could be used as a mech or a puppet! It had different uses depending on how it was reconstructed. The components inside didn’t have any engravings, and they could be reconstructed in many ways.

In the ancient civilization, there were close combat, distant attacks, automaton, valuables-making, and miscellaneous techniques. The former four were the mainstream, while the fifth one was a combination of all special techniques.

Each category had many branches. Close combat and distant attacks were extremely complicated. As for the automation category, there were “sea of machines techniques,” “original body techniques,” and “fortress techniques.” The embryos of the different techniques were different as well, and there were 72 types of embryos of automation.

“No wonder automation was so popular in the ancient civilization.” Luo Feng looked at all the embryos and he was tempted. “This is too powerful. Even if someone is less strong in laws and techniques, he can still kill his enemies with these machines. Unfortunately, I can only choose one.”

Luo Feng stood at the mountainside and looked at a giant stone blade. It was enormous. Even though it was plugged inside the mountainside, it was as tall as the entire mountain. There was gleaming light around the blade, and the shape was exquisite.

“There were three blade embryos. One of them is broad, one of them is thin, yet this one is my favorite.” The more Luo Feng looked at it, the more he fancied it. “It looks just like the blood shadow blade, yet it has a larger handle so that I can grab it with both hands. I’ll take it.”

Luo Feng walked to the front, held his breath, and put his hands on the large stone blade.

Just as he touched it, a film showed up on the blade, and countless law engravings started to flow, which were much more complicated than the law engravings he saw in the iceberg.

Hong!

The entire mountain of valuables started to tremble, and the corners started to glow. The engravings were shining along with the film. There was an inheritance mark between the eyebrows of Luo Feng.

They were resonating. And then, the films and light all disappeared, and Luo Feng’s life mark was branded on the giant blade.

“This blade embryo might be with me forever, until I reach the top or until I die.” Luo Feng lowered his head and stroked the blade. “I’ll call it Blood Shadow.”

It had simple Chinese characters on the blade. He’d used lots of blades as he grew up, but with his power growing, he’d been changing his blades. Now, he had finally found a blade that he was going to use forever. Blood Shadow Blade!

Blood Shadow Blade is so powerful that I can’t even measure it, thought Luo Feng. I might as well not take the blade out if I don’t want to kill my enemies.

The blade embryo was the only weapon he got after he became the new generation of Duan Dong River, and it was an exceptional weapon. It could already crack the space without being driven by any techniques or godly power. Plus, it could already rival the power of a fifth-level top-tier universe master. Even supreme true treasures couldn’t be this powerful without being driven. It was a valuable that was superior to supreme true treasures, and there was only one level of engraving on it!

Former generations of Duan Dong River, thought Luo Feng. Even if you despise those supreme true treasures, you can at least put some in the space of inheritance.

Other than those valuables embryos, there wasn’t a single supreme true treasure. The stones of memories left by former generations of Duan Dong River had clear records. Each generation of Duan Dong River only left an embryo.

As for other true treasures? Other skills? They needed to be fought for by the following generations of Duan Dong River! After all, the juniors needed to fight to grow, and they couldn’t do so if they only depended on the valuables left by the seniors.

The silver-armored form of Luo Feng left the space of valuables and entered the main area of the space of inheritance. He stood in the sky.

“Come!” Luo Feng waved his hands, and a trace of light flew toward him and floated in front of him. It was an octagon token: the control center of Boat of Mausoleum.

“The former generations of Duan Dong River didn’t leave any machines for me in the space of inheritance. However, this Boat of Mausoleum is a machine. And my Shi Wu Wings are a machine as well.”

Luo Feng easily controlled the center of the Boat of Mausoleum. “Space of inheritance” and “Blood Shadow Blade” were the most precious objects, followed by Star Tower and Shi Wu Wing, then followed by Boat of Mausoleum.

Shi Wu Wing and Boat of Mausoleum were both machines. Boat of Mausoleum wasn’t very powerful, yet he could control some dangerous components inside, so it was definitely a machine.

As for Shi Wu Wing, it was an “original-body fighting” machine! This kind of machine usually just helped its user. Shi Wu Wing would only be a mere true treasure if it didn’t have an origin. The origin was like an engine, and the godly power of great beings was transformed into terrific energies through the origin; they were let out through the wings.

Flame Ice region.

Boat of Mausoleum, floating in the sky, immediately disappeared. A silver-armored and silver-booted man carrying a stone blade appeared.

“Teacher Primal Chaos City Leader said that both Eastern Emperor Holy Land and Purple Moon Holy Land have great beings hidden here to catch the inheritor.” Luo Feng looked around and hid the Boat of Mausoleum and space of inheritance. “However, I’m not afraid of them now. I hope they leave me no choice but to use Blood Shadow Blade.”

Luo Feng waved his hands, and a bloody tower showed up. It was Star Tower. Luo Feng went into the tower and flew away.

He made the technique Nirvana Renaissance, and it had the power of the fifth-level universe master with Crazy Demon Extermination Godly Armor. If he used Blood Shadow Blade, which was superior to supreme true treasures…

“Although I can’t fight universe supreme masters now, they can’t kill me.” Luo Feng was confident. “Once I become a universe master and have more godly power…”

Luo Feng would be the most terrific universe master in the history of Universe Ocean. Universe masters only had six levels before. However, Luo Feng might have been at the seventh or even the eighth level!
