“The killing aura of the ancient god ruins. The sayings states that going there to soak in the killing aura would help with the absorption of the blood river crystals.”

“They also state that slaughtering would help with the absorption too.”

“Also that the requirements for absorption are very harsh!”

Luo Feng nodded, understanding finally. “Obviously, mad slaughtering and soaking in the killing aura from the ancient god ruins would produce a special effect in the body. Raising that certain part of the body will allow one to be able to absorb the crystal!”

Slaughter?

His earth body could be said to have slaughtered a lot, compared to normal humans.

Yet it wasn’t that much either, his earth body’s slaughtering was indeed limited. However he did slaughter quite a bit in the virtual universe network. However, those were all simulated and it wouldn’t change his body at all.

“Haha…”

“The only reason I’m heading to the ancient god ruins is to become a blood warrior and potentially even a black warrior. However I didn’t even expect the 2nd crystal absorption to fail.” Luo feng shook his head. As he closed his eyes, his consciousness connected to the virtual universe network and entered the absolute beginning region to train.

In the pathway.

“My luck sure is bad, I lost again.” Yu Chun Yang cursed as he walked.

“Big brother, big brother.” A voice resounded.

“Hm?” Yu Chun Yang turned to look. An armored youth was running over, extremely excited as he smiled and said, “I say Ah Xiang, why do you look so happy? Has our young master Na Ke been found?”

“Nope! The old master has been looking all over for him. However he seemed to have vanished,but no one knows to where.” The armored Yu Xiang shook his head. “Swallow mound city is in such a mess. With the young master’s dumb temperament, who knows… he may have messed with the wrong people and gotten himself killed.”

“Damn, you dare curse the young master’s death?” Yu Chun Yang stared.

Yu Xiang rolled his eyes, dragging Yu Chun Yang to the side and communicated mentally, “Big brother, have you seen the bounty rewards around?”

“What bounty, I just came out of the casino. Why would I have looked at the bounties.” Yu Chun Yang shook his head.

“Come with me.” Yu Xiang dragged his older brother.

“To where?”

“Just follow me.”

The two brothers quickly arrived before the bounty posters in a walkway. The allure of the bounty was simply too huge after all. Even now, large amounts of people hung about looking at it, many muttering and dreaming about being the ones who gave the information or discovered the killer, receiving the bounty.

“1 million treasure currency? 1 hundred million treasure currency?” Yu Chun Yang stared wide eyed.

“Look carefully at the details of the bounty, that killer’s picture, the weapons and armor he uses.” Yu Xiang communicated within.

Yu Chun Yang looked, immediately his eyes stared wide, turning back to look at his bother, replying, “Ah Xiang, this, this is the absolute warrior we met when we accompanied the young master into the wilderness forest. Didn’t he use this shield and this type of blade. And he instantly killed the 13 axe, they didn’t even have time to react. The 13 axe has three cloud levels. That warrior…should be a domain level!”

“Right.” Yu Xiang nodded, communicating, “Our Swallow mound city rarely ever sees a domain level warrior. The shield and weapons are the same, it wouldn’t be that coincidental? This Lord Feng is really vicious. Even the envoys of the undying shrine were killed, too vicious.”

“Should we?” Yu Chun Yang’s eyes gleamed.

“Do we go or not?” Yu Xiang looked at his big brother.

“This…” Yu Chun Yang hesitated.

“If you are not going, I’m going.” Yu Xiang communicated. “Don’t regret it, even though the old master treats us not bad, however, didn’t we enter the Na family for money?”

Yun Chun Yang grit his teeth, “Alright, let’s go!”

Hence, the 2 swiftly headed to the city leader’s mansion.

……

City leader’s mansion.

Si Yong sat in the throne of the palace. Gazing below, there were three people bowing respectfully.

“Have you found anything?” Si Yong’s voice was solemn, yet filled with formless pressure. “After pasting the bounties, it’s definitely been better. However of the three you all mentioned before, two of them were determined to be false. That last one…we are unable to confirm. Yet, you say there’s a guarantee now?”

“World city leader!” A deputy general from the army was filled with glee, saying excitedly, “This time, the guarantee is much bigger than before! We’ve acquired three people’s confessions…they all state the same person.”

“Hm?” Above the palace, Si Yong looked up.

“He’s called Feng! According to the confessions of the three people…not long ago, this Feng was in the wild beast forest outside. There he met Swallow mound city’s Na Family’s young master Na Ke and his guards. Along the way, they were attacked by the 13 axe, but that mysterious warrior simply attacked and formed 13 images. With 13 blades, he killed all of them, and apparently they didn’t even have the chance to react!”

“13 axe, what organization is that?” Si Yong frowned.

“World city leader, they are a prominent organization within this Swallow mound territory. The 13 axe refer to 13 warriors, of which 3 are cloud level! And 10 of them at sky level pinnacle.” The deputy general said respectfully, “As for the deaths of the 13 axe, we’ve already confirmed that they were all done by that one person.”

“Ah?” Si Yong stood up violently.

This news was vicious!

Instantly producing 13 images and killing 13, and of which 3 were cloud levels…

“Space origin laws?” Si Yong’s eyes lit up, confirming within, “Right, the footage envoy Mo sent of the black warrior, he was using space laws, and his speed was extremely shocking.”

“Weapon?” Si Yong asked.

“Shield, blade, similar to the picture.” The deputy general said seriously.

“Very good!” Si Yong’s eyes gleamed, “Go, find out more news on this Feng!”

“Yes!”

……

Back then he couldn’t bear to leave his business and chose to remain in Swallow mound city. As his memory had been wiped, Nabu had been extremely anxious since he discovered his son was missing. He activated all his strength and resources to madly search for his son. So much so that he didn’t even look at the bounty.

When he actually saw it, he was shocked.

He too had suspected that the killer could very likely be Lord Feng! Hence he immediately wanted to control that group of guards.

However, other than the 4 he managed to control, the others weren’t around.

“Bring them away!”

“Bring them all away.”

“Hurry and look, this the namelist of the guards from back then. Find all of them. Also…hurry and find the Na Family’s young master Na Ke.”

The group of soldiers rushed into the Na family, grabbing Nabu and Thunder uncle away.

A purple uniformed beautiful lady stood outside the torture chamber. Clang! After it opened, the deputy general walked out.

“Greetings Lord.” The general was shocked as he saw the lady, bowing respectfully. This beautiful lady before him was one of the 4 great underlings World city leader Si Yong had brought with him, a domain level warrior.

“Interrogate the Na Family leader, have you found anything on Feng?” The lady questioned.

“No, he said he didn’t know either.” The deputy general shook his head. “I’ve carefully interrogated him, however I’ve discovered that this Na Family leader barely knew this Feng and had just met him a couple of times. Their relationship wasn’t deep.”

“Useless!” The beautiful lady roared.

The deputy general’s face flushed red, wanting to reply but not daring to say anything.

“Get out, take all of your men and leave. Leave it to me.” The lady said.

“Yes!”

The deputy general immediately took all of the army within the torture chamber, leaving only Nabu and Thunder uncle.

……

Within the torture chamber.

Nabu and thunder uncle were both pale, with injuries all over, they had been subjected to physical torture.

“Old master, we thought that the meeting of Lord Feng was a good thing. Who’d have expect we’d end up like this. It’s truly, truly…” Thunder uncle sighed. Beside him Nabu sighed too. “Lei Dong, this time our Na Family has implicated you.”

“Old master…” Thunder uncle was just about to speak.

That purple clothed lady walked in. By simply walking there, it caused both thunder uncle and Nabu to lose control of themselves. As their gaze fell on her body, they gradually fell into a daze.

“That group of idiots, using torture while interrogating, idiots.” The purple lady’s expression grew heavy, beginning her questioning. “You speak first, tell me the whole story of the meeting, and tell it clearly to me. Also tell me some of your conjectures…tell them all to me.”

Thunder uncle told the entire story.

Nabu too spoke.

Both of them, under the soul technique’s control, both guessed…that the killer was very likely to be Feng.

This questioning too made the purple clothed lady’s expression ugly.

The cold pierced through bones, a blurry long haired Si Yong stood in the pathway. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Master.” The purple haired lady walked over and bowed respectfully.

“From your footsteps, the results of the interrogation must not be very good.” Si Yong looked in the distance, his back facing the lady.

She lowered her head and said, “Yes, I used soul techniques and confirmed that these two weren’t lying. Their Na Family had indeed met with this Feng. However, this Feng seemed to have favored the young master Na Ke.”

“Na Ke? Where is he?” Si Yong asked indifferently.

“Na Ke has vanished.” The purple haired lady said softly. “And he vanished the night of the deaths of the envoys. Other than that, we cannot find any other information on this Feng. Also, Na Ke’s disappearance…even his father doesn’t know. Hence he’s been anxiously looking for his son, not even noticing the bounty, all this was revealed by some of his guards.”

“Na Ke’s disappearance is too much of a coincidence. I can guarantee that it has something to do with the killer!”

“Right now there are two possibilities.”

“One of them is that Na Ke knows detailed information on Feng. The killer was worried that his identity would be revealed. Hence, he killed him to silence him.”

“The second possibility is that Luo Feng knew it would be troublesome after killing the envoys, and that the trouble would befall the Na Family. Since he favored Na Ke, he took him away.” The purple haired lady said respectfully.

“What about Feng?” Si Yong’s voice was filled with a sense of rage. “I don’t want to know anything else about him. I just want to know…where this killer is. I want to catch him!”

“No idea, I cannot find anything.” The purple haired lady shook her head.

Rumble!

Si Yong waved his fist in rage. It hit the pillar on the side, immediately the mad explosive energy exploded, and terrifying shockwaves burst out from the pillar. It then fanned out and caused large amounts of constructs to be reduced to dust. Many waiters, soldiers and guards were immediately reduced to a mess, the lucky ones only had broken limbs.

In an instant, several km around the city leader’s mansion was reduced to waste, there were cries of pain and rumbling.

“Bastard!!!” Si Yong violently turned. His expression struggling, his explosive aura causing the skies and land to tremble.

“Master, what do I do with the Na Family?” The purple clothed lady asked respectfully.
