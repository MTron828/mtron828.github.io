Chapter 1365: The Order of Purple Moon Ancestor

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After leaving Nine Smoke Marsh, Luo Feng rushed to the East Army military camp. Other than him, there was also Wu He, who had secretly left Nine Smoke Marsh.

Out of the three troops of warriors led by the captain, Ku Fa, and Yu Luo—who were all designated with a mission and were still within the Nine Smoke Marsh region—only the captain had managed to obtain a true god corpse. The other warriors, including Ku Fa and Yu Luo, had not managed to gather enough military credits. They were all brainstorming possible solutions.

Should they kill amongst one another? Should they continue to hunt? Or wait to reap benefits while the others’ did the job? They were all certainly going to do their best, but it was also fated that a single disaster-level mission would cause many of them to be annihilated.

“Finally, I have arrived.”

Hong!

A lone figure appeared midair. That figure was none other than Luo Feng.

Looking far off into the distance, Luo Feng could see the vast, boundless military camp. He revealed a trace of a smile as he bowed his head to look down at everything beneath. He could also see the long queue of tribal warriors and beasts who had come to join the army.

Sou!

Luo Feng flew into the military camp.

******

Just as Luo Feng entered the East Army military camp, many wormholes on the peripheral region of the East Army military camp, within a contorted space, were transporting great beings.

Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!

With almost every single moment that passed, warriors continued flying out from the various wormholes.

“Let’s go. The mission this time around is considered easy. We can finish it quickly, and then we can have another era worth of free time.”

“Let’s go.”

“Aye. Our next mission will be at the reincarnation-level. Who knows how many from our troop will be able to survive? I hope this time, we can earn more military credits. Then we can exchange them for a few more treasures from the military point. Then hopefully, we can pull through the reincarnation-level mission.”

Batch after batch of warriors, ranging from relaxed to stern to worried state, all left.

The East Army was simply too big. With every passing moment, there were warriors leaving. And among those warriors leaving in a continuous stream, one warrior, who seemed to be an ordinary law master, stood on one of the branches of an aged yet sturdy tree in the distance.

“I am here on the orders of Ancestor. Upon being accepted into the army, I might have been assigned with missions, but I have never gone about executing any of them… Here I am instead, just waiting. I have been here for so long, yet I have never laid eyes on that Milky Way Horde Leader, not even once.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The silver-armored warrior was very worried, yet, at the same time, he maintained a watchful eye.

“Milky Way Horde Leader is very impressive, but so what if he is that impressive? Even if he did transcend reincarnation, he merely contributed another holy land to our Universe Ocean. To us of the Purple Moon Holy Land, he is no threat at all.” The silver-armored warrior could not make sense of this situation. “Once a holy land is established, it will be an eternal existence. My Purple Moon Holy Land universe is not afraid of any great beings, so I simply cannot understand why Ancestor holds this Milky Way Horde Leader in such high regard. Even all the way here in this World of Jin… he still gave orders for us to look into his whereabouts.”

The silver-armored warrior sighed inwardly. He simply did not understand. He was filled with doubts, but this was Ancestor’s order; he did not dare defy it.

******

The vast Universe Ocean was mysterious and unfathomable.

In one of the two holy land universes, Purple Moon Holy Land, Purple Moon Ancestor was growing angry and dissatisfied.

“Have you discovered Luo Feng’s whereabouts yet?”

Two nervous figures knelt before him with great reverence.

“Ancestor, previously, we watched the Boat of Mausoleum entering the World of Jin, so we followed it in. Based on his point of entry, if he wanted to make it to an army, it would be an 80 to 90 percent chance that he would end up at East Army! So after I joined the East Army, I have been watching the exits of the numerous wormholes, and indeed, I have yet to discover Milky Way Horde Leader.”

“We have certainly not discovered traces of him, Ancestor. Could it be that Milky Way Horde Leader has yet to join the army?”

The two universe masters remained on their knees.

“He has the inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River. Even if he is in the World of Jin, he is able to break away of anything easily, so much so that he is making a name for himself.” Purple Moon Ancestor looked down towards the two universe masters and said coldly, “Not only do the two of you need to keep a close watch at the exit of the wormholes, but you also need to frequently inquire about him. The moment he gains a reputation, you will be able to find out more about him easily.”

“Understood.”

“Understood.”

The two universe masters answered with great reverence.

“Ancestor, we… Our troop’s mission…?” The double-faced universe master with four arms could not help asking.

“The two of you shall rotate,” Purple Moon Ancestor instructed with great indifference. “While one keeps watch and patrol, the other will go out to complete its troop’s mission. When the mission is completed, return to the military camp to continue searching and investigating. The other team shall go out to complete their mission. This time around, very few of our Purple Moon Holy Land have entered the World of Jin. Until the next era, there will be quite a handful of universe masters going over. By that time, you both will have a much easier time.”

“Understood.”

The two universe masters were also earnestly praying for the next era to arrive.

“Get moving, then.” Purple Moon Ancestor dismissed them with a wave.

The two universe masters took their leave in a most respectful manner.

Purple Moon Ancestor’s face was blurred. Only a pair of eyes was visible. The gaze carried only a trace of feminine grace while the most of it was filled with endless murderous intent. “I had thought that it was impossible to kill you. Yet, who knows? The World of Jin has come into existence! In the World of Jin… the number who can kill you, Luo Feng, is just too many! Luo Feng, don’t blame me. You can only blame yourself for receiving that inheritance of the pulse of Duan Dong River.”

In the virtual universe, at the peak of Thunder Island, Luo Feng met with Primal Chaos City Leader.

“Luo Feng.”

“Teacher.”

Teacher and disciple sat apart from one another.

“I just completed a disaster-level mission and have gained quite a substantial amount of military credits,” Luo Feng said. “Completing this mission means that for quite a long period of time, I will be safe. I will try my best to uncover the mysteries of the entire World of Jin as soon as possible!”

“Hmm. You are the first of our human race to enter.” Primal Chaos City Leader nodded. “Your responsibility is the greatest. Now, throughout the entire Universe Ocean—whether within the primal universe, another reincarnation era, the two great holy land universes, or other words—great beings from all over have their sights on the World of Jin. After all, the first batch to enter will be able to get hold of first-hand information and understand more about the World of Jin, which is simply too alluring.”

Luo Feng nodded. This was to be expected. In the Universe Ocean, various great beings yearned to transcend reincarnation, and also, they yearned to get hold of a supreme true treasure.

However, in the World of Jin, there were many true gods of void spaces! Obviously, there would be a cultivation method that could allow a true god to achieve a complete breakthrough to attain the level of a true god of void space. This so-called supreme true treasure was actually the standard armor of a true god, and there was simply too many of them. Even various magical automaton-type treasures existed.

The opportunity to transcend reincarnation, find supreme true treasures, and gain automaton-type treasures was too alluring. All the powerful groups in Universe Ocean lost interest in the three most dangerous lands instantly. Everyone was extremely excited as they set their sights longingly on the World of Jin. The only catch was that the chance to enter only happened once every era.

“Previously, the willpower of the primal universe origin came looking for me through Ancestral God.” Luo Feng smiled. “Apparently, it is better for me to stay put here for the time being. The longer, the better. I will make use of this advantage of being in the World of Jin. Besides… this time, I have earned quite a bit of military credits. I may be able to bring some supreme true treasures with me when I return. After one era has passed, when I get out of here, I will send some of these supreme true treasures back.”

Primal Chaos City Leader was delighted upon hearing such news.

The World of Jin was the most important battlefield! Various groups of top powers would fight for it. Yet the human territory within the primal universe represented the roots of the human race! Only by expanding their territory could human talents multiply in numbers, and there could be continuity in the outburst of great beings being born. In this way, the human race could reach the level of the other two holy land universes or even surpass them.

“Teacher, I will head for the military point first,” Luo Feng said. “At the military point, I can trade military credits for inheritance and obtain various treasures. I believe I should be able to catch a glimpse of the more profound secrets of the World of Jin. When I have gained a better understanding of the military point, I will share the information with you.”

“Get going,” Primal Chaos City Leader replied right away. “But remember, don’t take risks. The World of Jin is much more dangerous than our Universe Ocean.”

Luo Feng nodded. He might have been roaming and wandering about the World of Jin, but he maintained frequent contact and had regular conversations with his teacher. He was constantly aware of the various happenings in Universe Ocean. Right now, Universe Ocean could be said to be calm and tranquil. Obviously, various parties were eyeing the World of Jin!

East Army military camp, Python River Army camp.

Luo Feng and Wu He arrived at the military camp at almost the same time.

“Milky Way, Milky Way.” Wu He went scuttling over to Luo Feng, following from behind. The wings attached to its neck flapped continuously as it said, “I have readied the treasure. You can give me one in exchange now.”

“You have prepared it?” Luo Feng looked at him jeeringly. “There is no rush at all. I will go to the military point first. When I get back from the military point, we shall have a good talk.”

Wu He was somewhere reluctant. If Luo Feng were to go to the military point, it would mean he would understand the value of certain treasures, and it also meant that Luo Feng would mercilessly oppress him. But no matter how reluctant Wu He was, he did not dare to argue with Luo Feng. All he could do was move his hideous-looking face and smile.

“Yes, yes,” he said. “When Milky Way is back from the military point, then we’ll talk. Milky Way, don’t forget to keep one for me!”

He was most worried that this new recruit, Milky Way, would trade all those true god corpses for military credits. That would truly deal him a devastating blow. It would be the same as sentencing him to death.

Luo Feng nodded. “Don’t worry.”

Sou!

Luo Feng left the camp right away, feeling overjoyed as he headed toward the military point at the main hall.

Python River Army’s lake camp was quite a distance from the main hall, but Luo Feng seemed to be enjoying the scenery as he went along. He was in a good mood, so he strolled to the military point at the main hall.

“The military point!” Luo Feng raised his head to look at the towering, ancient main hall.

“According to the rules, before accepting and after completing a mission, I would be qualified to trade for treasures in the military point. But if I turn up here without completing the mission… then I cannot enter.”

Luo Feng softly recalled the military rules, then made his way through the doors of that broad and towering hall. The moment he walked through the main doors, there was a sudden change in time and space. It was as though he had stepped into another world.

Luo Feng was taken aback. “What secret technique is this?”

Before him was a vast world—a world that was boundless—and there were many warriors scattered all over the place. Before each of them was a golden figure.

“Compared to the virtual universe, this is much more magical…!” Luo Feng secretly exclaimed.

Sou!

A golden figure appeared out of nowhere to land before Luo Feng. Luo Feng took a close look at the golden figure before him, yet he simply could not see its face clearly. The figure was completely enveloped in golden light.

“Warrior of Python River Army, you are on a mission.” The golden figure looked at Luo Feng. “You are not allowed to trade for any items at military points.”

“My mission is accomplished,” said Luo Feng.

With a single wave, Luo Feng revealed the serpentine corpse of a huge beast true god by his side. It was a gigantic corpse close to one million kilometers long. The corpse appeared so suddenly that even the warriors afar were in for a shock. Ironically, within this military point, almost all the warriors were law masters.
