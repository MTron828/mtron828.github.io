Chapter 1431: The Might of Star Tower

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The moment Luo Feng fought Sector Beast, he would change location without fail. That Golden Horned Beast body boarded his vessel and left right away. The team onboard Star Tower also followed suit in changing location. Furthermore, there were so many miniature universes within the Universe Ocean—where to go, exactly? At that time, Luo Feng instinctively made a move of intention, and Star Tower made its way right over to Rampaging Devil God’s miniature universe!

“My Star Tower team is much stronger Golden Horned Beast. That is where my strongest combat power lies!” Luo Feng’s fighting spirit was ablaze. “Twice I fought it, and twice it escaped. This time around, I will make sure it cannot escape!”

This confidence was not unfounded but based on absolute power!

Sou!

Star Tower immediately teleported and headed to the coordinates provided by Rampaging Devil God.

Sector Beast Morosa stood in the void space where the surroundings were filled with black fog. Streams of distorted light rays extended right into the void space and continued to devour the origin of the miniature universe. It was maintaining vigilance by keeping close tabs on its surroundings.

“I hope Milky Way Horde Leader and Nine Remoteness True Master do not appear here.” Sector Beast Morosa prayed fervently. “I need to become more powerful, much more powerful…”

Many true god teams were now appearing in Universe Ocean, and all these teams were led by true gods with super great godly powers. While Sector Beast Morosa was helpless against them, it did not fear them. It only feared Luo Feng and Nine Remoteness.

Merely a short moment later, the space around him suddenly froze. Sector Beast Morosa was shocked.

“Huh?” Sector Beast Morosa immediately looked off into the distance. A nine-story tower had appeared out of nowhere. When he saw the tower, he let his guard down. Luckily, it was not the vessel Nine Remoteness True Master and Milky Way Horde Leader traveled about in. But it only took a short moment for Sector Beast Morosa to display a drastic change in expression.

“No!” it said when it was finally capable of reacting. This was Milky Way Horde Leader’s supreme true treasure, which was highly-reputed throughout Universe Ocean: Star Tower! “How could it be you?” Sector Beast Morosa roared in fury.

One of the doors at the base level of Star Tower opened. Luo Feng, in a suit of black armor, walked out with a blade slung across his back. A tail that was swaying behind him.

“You’re right, it’s me again,” Luo Feng said.

“You, you, you…” Sector Beast, Morosa, looked at Luo Feng. It was fuming. It knew the capabilities of this Milky Way Horde Leader before it. Even if it tried to escape, Milky Way Horde Leader would be able to trap it right away. Then it would be forced to use up a large amount of energy to execute its ultimate technique before it could escape.

Sector Beast Morosa yelled, “Milky Way Horde Leader! Don’t push it! You yourself know… there is no way you can catch me. Don’t press your luck. If I really get angry, I will make sure you regret it this time!”

“Regret it?” Luo Feng stood in the void space. Everything was within his control at that moment. If he could get some information from Sector Beast Morosa, then it was obvious that Luo Feng would be most willing to listen.

“How are you going to make me regret it?” Luo Feng pressed, purposely challenging the Sector Beast with a tinge of sarcasm. “You alone? You are not my match. My human race is a race of the primal universe. We have many true gods that can arrive at any of our race’s miniature universes at any time. You stand no chance at all.”

Sector Beast, Morosa, said in a low voice, “True. Alone, I stand no chance, but what if I were to lead a group of Sector Beasts over here?”

Luo Feng trembled at the thought of it. A group of Sector Beasts? Oh, God…

A single Sector Beast was enough to create chaos in the entire Universe Ocean. If an entire group showed up, that would be a nightmare. The true gods could also form numerous teams, but if the Sector Beasts were to follow suit, how would the true gods fight them off?

“You had better not take my words lightly,” Sector Beast Morosa said in a low voice. “I do have such an ability.”

This was the truth. The Sector Beast was the noblest life form born in Universe Ocean. After one billion Sector Beasts were born, these billion were destined to devour one another until only one remained alive. The surviving Sector Beast would be the final king, and also, the final one who truly qualified to represent destruction! The final Sector Beast who was lucky enough to survive would then qualify to be placed on the same scale as the primal universe.

Because it was fated that there could only be one survivor, these Sector Beasts were all born with the ability to detect one another’s presence. Sector Beast Morosa was no exception; after it managed to escape the best, it could sense where the other Sector Beasts were, so even if it where to get lost within Universe Ocean, it could rely on its senses to return home! Not only were they able to sense one another, but they were also telepathic and could communicate with one another’s souls. And because of this, even if a Sector Beast intended to avoid fighting, there was no way it could get its way!

Within the Land of Darkness, there were other Sector Beasts who had detected Sector Beast Morosa’s escape. But none of them were concerned. They just had to wait a while longer to devour Morosa.

“They don’t know how delicious the origins of miniature universes are, or how devouring them can help to increase power. If they knew, they would definitely come charging out,” Sector Beast Morosa mumbled to itself. “However, this is such a precious opportunity, so there is no way I can give it up to them. These origins of miniature universes are all mine.”

Sector Beast Morosa was unwilling to share its secret. If it were to tell the others, then it would no longer be able to have everything to itself. However, if it was forced into such a dire situation by Luo Feng and Nine Remoteness—where not only was it unable to increase its power, but its power might be weakened instead—then it would, in a fit of anger, tell the numerous Sector Beasts within their nest in the Land of Darkness everything it knew. Even if the majority of Sector Beasts were unwilling to leave their nest (it was an innate characteristic of the Sector Beasts to not usually be keen to leave their nest), Morosa’s guess was that there would still be a few who were having a tough time within the nest and would be willing to leave.

******

Luo Feng made a mental note. Then, with a sneer, he said, “Oh? How do you intend to lead those Sector Beasts? Also… within your Sector Beasts’ nest, how many Sector Beasts are there in all? If the number is small, I won’t be daunted.”

“Hahaha. If you want to know more information, then you should go look into it for yourself. Go to the nest of the Sector Beasts. You should not behave like the two cowards previously, who only stayed around the borders. They were so afraid that they fled. Venture deep into our nest of Sector Beasts if you have the guts.”

As Sector Beast Morosa spoke, Hong, who was within Star Tower, frowned with closely knitted brows. Cowards? Of the two who had entered the nest, one of them was him, Hong!

“Since you have nothing else to say, let’s battle.” Luo Feng wanted to make a move right away.

“Stop!” said Sector Beast Morosa, its expression changing. Every single time they fought, it required a long time to restore its power. It was reluctant to fight Luo Feng any further. But the initiative rested in Luo Feng’s hands. Even if it were to divide bodies to make an escape now, Luo Feng would be able to apprehend him. So he responded right away, “Milky Way Horde Leader, let’s make a deal.”

“A deal?” Luo Feng raised a brow.

“Yes!” Sector Beast, Morosa, replied immediately. “I can swear an oath, that I will absolutely not lay a finger on your human race, and I will not devour the origins of your miniature universes. But you cannot put me in a difficult spot either. How about it?”

Luo Feng snorted. “An oath? Of what use is an oath?”

“I can issue an oath under the law, with the laws of Universe Ocean as witness whereof, I hereby issue my oath. By the time the law has been passed down… you will also be able to clearly detect it, and then you will come to understand that there is no way I can break an oath. After all, I am also a living soul that was bred from within the Universe Ocean. I trust you are aware that Zhen Jia Emperor and Dragon Rock Ancestral God are both on the Sector Beasts’ side.”

Sector Beast Morosa had long been aware of the fact that the various races of Universe Ocean had discovered the true identities of those two underlings. The various races of Universe Ocean had shunned Zhen Jia Emperor and Dragon Rock Ancestral God for quite some time.

“Why did they trust that we, the Sector Beasts, would not kill them? This was all because of… oaths! Oaths under the law!” Sector Beast said.

“An oath coming from a single Sector Beast like yourself? How can it possibly represent all the Sector Beasts?” Luo Feng shook his head in disbelief.

“Of course it cannot. For those who decided to seek refuge with the Sector Beasts, other than oaths, there are other ways… In short, the Sector Beasts would absolutely not attack them again.” Sector Beast Morosa looked at Luo Feng. “If Milky Way Horde Leader is willing to come over to us, I can allow you to possess a different kind of power. And in regards to all your ‘Sector Beast crisis,’ so long as you submit yourself to us, you will be a part of us and will not be affected at all.”

Luo Feng knew what the Sector Beast was referring to. This so-called “different kind of power” was the power that Great Thunder Star Master had previously used. It was the power the Sector Beasts possessed. However, Luo Feng was aware of the fact that there was no such thing as a free lunch. Even legends of the ancient civilization had records of numerous powerful nations that had been destroyed but had never sought refuge with the Sector Beasts. From this alone, he could deduce that seeking refuge with the Sector Beasts might lead to another situation. He might even become a slave with no power of resistance at all.

“Stop your nonsense.” Luo Feng ordered coldly.

“It’s also alright if you do not want to come over,” Sector Beast Morosa continued to say. “How about me not being an enemy of your human race? Wouldn’t that be good?”

“Even if we can hide from you, we cannot avoid the other Sector Beasts from your Sector Beast nest,” Luo Feng continued in his cold tone. “Are you able to get all the other Sector Beasts to swear upon the same oath, to never make any advances on my human race?”

Sector Beast Morosa was taken aback. How was that possible…? Like the powerful “Beddy,” who could get much more powerful by devouring other Sector Beasts, how was it possible to let the entire human race off the hook?

“In that case, be prepared to meet your doom!” Luo Feng shouted.

But Luo Feng did not react immediately. He wanted to see if there was any other way to force this Sector Beast Morosa into giving him more important information.

“Loathsome Milky Way Horde Leader! You are always forcing me into corners! I will absolutely not spare you, absolutely not!”

Sector Beast Morosa finally let go of all restraints and went wild. It no longer had the patience to negotiate with Luo Feng. With a loud howl, many diagrams of engravings appeared on its body. Enshrouded by 99 diagrams of secret engravings, its body immediately exploded with a loud crash and was divided into 99 parts. Then it started to flee.

Luo Feng looked on from afar, sneering. Inside Star Tower, which was not far away, his Remote Ocean body had ten silver wings widely spread behind it as its godly power executed the third volume of Duan Mie—Annihilation. It was also burning up its godly body to the ultimate limit and making use of Shi Wu Wings to activate this technique.

Weng!

In the vast void of space, a white fog began to fill up an area of several light years. This area of void space had long been isolated from the outside world, and an infinitely powerful restraining force enveloped this part of the void space.

At that moment, the restraining force far surpassed the force of Snowy World, causing the 99 escaping parts divided from Morosa’s original body to slow down. Although its speed was being reduced, it was still flying.

“Still able to fly?” Mosha Luo Feng, in his Wu Qi God armor, looked on from afar and shook his head. He could not be bothered to use a method similar to Universe Chain. He had something more powerful. “Star Tower!”

Luo Feng made a move in mind

Hong!

From afar, Star Tower suddenly released an incomparably violent outburst of energy, which instantly enshrouded an area of several light years. The entire area was enveloped.

Hua! Hua! Hua!

The nine entrances at the base of Star Tower were like nine bottomless whirlpools, crazily devouring everything. A bout of bizarre devouring force was produced at each entrance. And when the nine different forces combined into one point, an area of a couple of light years was selected by this bizarre, aggressive whirlpool. It was even stronger than that of “single thought void space”!

Originally, it was already very difficult for the 99 divided bodies to accelerate and fly out, yet upon falling into the endless Star Tower whirlpool world, it started to reduce speed rapidly.

Suddenly, rather advancing, it actually started to fly backward.
