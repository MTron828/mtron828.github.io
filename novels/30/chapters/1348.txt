Chapter 1350: Catastrophe Level

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Catastrophe level?” Wu He was shocked. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Luo Feng looked at the group of soldiers in front of him. The giant man in the lead said coldly, “I am the captain of the sixth squad of the first team, and all the rules and knowledge of the army are in here. Learn everything yourself, and if there are no special occasions, don’t disturb other teammates.”

Then two crystal balls showed up. Each crystal was the size of a finger; Luo Feng and Wu He took them.

“Go back to training! Prepare!” the captain yelled.

“Yes,” some soldiers answered, yet some other soldiers didn’t respond. Apparently, the captain didn’t have enough authority.

“I need to remind you that the catastrophe-level task is coming,” said a clear voice. It was a female with green skin and green wings.

“Ku Fa, do you really think those two newbies can survive the catastrophe-level task?”

“Humph!”

“They haven’t received the basic inheritance, and they don’t have enough time to train themselves. How are they going to pass the catastrophe-level task?”

The other soldiers all shook their heads, teleported, and left. They didn’t want to talk with Luo Feng and Wu He.

The captain took a look at Luo Feng and Wu He and said, “Prepare yourselves.”

Shua!

He left as well. Only Luo Feng and Wu He stayed.

“It seems that we’re unlucky,” Luo Feng whispered. “Wu He, what does ‘catastrophe-level’ tasks mean?”

Wu He bellowed, “We’re very unlucky! The army will go out and do the task prepared every era, and we’ll be ordered to make attacks at a specific place. For every 10,000 eras, there’ll come a task that is very dangerous, and it’s at catastrophe level. For every 100 million eras, there’ll be a task more horrifying—at incarnation level.”

“Incarnation level?” Luo Feng was dazed.

“That means if you’re faced with that task, you’re going for incarnations.” Wu He glanced at Luo Feng.

Luo Feng smiled. Those in the World of Jin treated incarnations as death, which meant the incarnation-level task was indeed full of dangers.

“If we were in the ordinary army, then even the incarnation level would fine for us,” Wu He said nervously. “However, this is Python River Army. The ordinary tasks in Python River Army equal those of the incarnation level of the ordinary army. As for catastrophe level… That means a real catastrophe for talents like us. The incarnation level is a nightmare. Half of experienced soldiers will die during the incarnation-level tasks! By comparison, the survival rate in the ordinary army is much higher. Those who have been training for a long time in the ordinary army can become supreme beings among law universes. Those supreme beings can survive the incarnation-level tasks. The more powerful someone is, the most difficult the tasks will be. At the law-universe level, no matter how powerful we are, there’s a limit. However, the military task is very difficult, and many die!”

Luo Feng felt intimidated. Only a few out of 100 who joined the ordinary army could live long enough to retire. According to Wu He, special armies like Python River Army had an even lower survival rate. His Majesty the Godly King, from the World of Jin, had designed a mad screening process.

“It’s much more dangerous.” Wu He’s eyes glinted madly. “But it’s much easier for us to get a precious inheritance and powerful valuables! Those supreme beings in the World of Jin, like true gods of void space, were all selected from the special armies. As for ordinary armies? They’ll stay mediocre for their entire lives! My father is the master of Northern True Ocean. I need to become as powerful as my father, if not stronger.”

Luo Feng took a look at Wu He and smiled. “Let’s go. We need to choose an island to live on first.”

******

Complicated information was contained in the crystal balls, but there wasn’t much of it. It simply introduced the military rules and regulations to Luo Feng and Wu He, who immediately grasped them using their godly power. They also knew that this lake belonged to Python River Army.

There were three teams in Python River Army, and each team occupied an area of this lake. There were nine squads in the first team, and each squad had its own area. They could choose any island without an owner for them to practice on.

Hong!

They teleported and became streaks of red light flying across the sky above an island.

“Soldiers in the special army have different treatments, as they can occupy an island while other great beings are banned from entering it.” Luo Feng looked down and felt satisfied. As for Wu He, he chose a more distant island.

Sou!

Luo Feng quickly landed. The island had a diameter of more than 100,000 kilometers. It was only a small island. At the center was a simple, stone-made residence. If he wasn’t satisfied with it, he could certainly rebuild it. Luo Feng didn’t care about that, as he only needed a place to rest.

“Freeze.” Luo Feng’s godly power spread, and he went to the deep area of the island. He touched a prismatic crystal stone and infused his godly power. The crystal stone’s color changed.

From now on, the island had an owner!

******

On the roof of the stone-made house, Luo Feng lay in a stone chair. The stone chair was huge, and Luo Feng’s godly body changed to 100 kilometers tall. He lay on the stone chair as if it were a bed. He looked into the distance and could see endless lakes and islands.

“I’ve entered World of Jin and Python River Army, the special army of the east army. One year later, there will be a task.”

Luo Feng was thinking about his path. Supreme true treasures? Machine type valuables? They both required military credits!

I really need blood and scale armors of true gods, Luo Feng thought. I need to get as many bodies of true gods as possible and take them back to the original universe.

In the past eight million eras, Luo Feng had devoted most of his energy to studying the composition of life forms. Humans were of flesh and blood type, so he would still be a life of flesh and blood type after he became a true god and all his bodies were combined as one. As a result, Luo Feng best understood flesh and blood type life forms. He could change the new Remote Ocean body into a flesh and blood life form using the structure of life genes, and he could make its life gene level reach 10,081 times.

However, Mosha body was an energy type life form, and Luo Feng hadn’t spent much time on them. Although he had an elementary understanding, its life gene level was only at 5,000 times.

I’ve improved too slowly. I haven’t even surpassed 10,081 times yet, let alone 90,000 times.

Luo Feng felt nervous. Based on his understanding, the higher a gene level was, the more difficult it was to get a higher gene level. His original life gene level was 10,081 times, so it would only take him a little time to analyze this level. He had succeeded in fully analyzing this level, and he had reorganized Remote Ocean body with a life gene level of 1,000 times. It was like turning wood into a diamond. He had changed the internal composition of Remote Ocean body, making it a powerful godly body at the perfect life gene level. However, surpassing 10,081 times and reaching 15,000 times or higher was much more difficult.

There were several levels. Level one was to surpass the perfect life gene level. Level two was to reach a life gene level of 30,000 times. Level three was to reach 60,000 times. Level four was to reach 90,000 times.

In terms of gene structure, true gods were far more advanced than universe masters, and they could provide more insights in terms of a breakthrough for Luo Feng. However, Luo Feng only had the body of Great Thunder Star Master and the hair and blood of Sitting Mountain Guest and Primal Chaos City Leader. That was far from adequate; he needed much more.

Luo Feng knew exactly the steps he needed to follow. First, he needed to analyze billions of life forms and billions of material structures. Second, he needed to create life forms.

Life forms that could procreate were the most difficult to create! The life forms Nine Remoteness Master created were born in the ocean. They were all energy life forms, so they couldn’t procreate. Those were the easiest ones to create. If Luo Feng wanted to create life forms that could procreate, he needed to study the origin of life forms, which was far more complicated. Of course, it would help to analyze many life forms.

Luo Feng estimated that his godly body could at least evolve to a life gene level of 50,000 times. Only after reaching that level could he create life forms that could procreate, which could, in turn, help him move higher on the godly power path.

Bodies of true gods and military credits! Luo Feng thought. I’ll go check the basic inheritance now.

Luo Feng, who had been lying on the stone chair, flew away like a streak of light.

******

There was a basic inheritance of Python River Army at the center of the island.

Sou!

Luo Feng immediately landed. There were pillars all around the island, and each pillar had a crystal ball. Wu He was shaking his head in the distance, and his body was winding around a pillar.

“Milky Way.” Wu He let go of the stone pillar. His claws clenched the ground, and the wings on his neck fluttered. He flew toward Luo Feng like a streak of light. “What took you so long? The catastrophe-level task is coming. We need to spend as much time as possible to study the basic inheritance. Although it’s a basic inheritance, it’s still a lot. That’s something even my father couldn’t teach me, and it is precious! Those from the army need to exchange the inheritance for military credits. We’re in the special army, which is why we can get a free basic inheritance instantly after we enter. However, the more complicated the inheritance was, the more military credits were required to get it. Be quick. I’ll continue with my comprehension.”

Wu He stopped speaking. Apparently, he wanted to fully utilize the time.

Luo Feng nodded. There were around 100 crystal balls on the island. He immediately spread his godly power and penetrated it into each crystal ball. Information flooded his mind.

“True treasure making, machine making, close combat, illusions, combinations, and burning godly power techniques.”

Luo Feng was greatly surprised. He had expected the basic inheritance to be mediocre, but it was, in fact, very useful. Those combat techniques, combination techniques, and burning godly power techniques could all improve his fighting power. As for the training, it only covered how to become a true god.

Burning godly power techniques only had one level, like the first volume of Duan Mie. Based on the instruction, law masters could only learn the first level while true gods could learn the second level.

The inheritance after that required military credits to be obtained.
