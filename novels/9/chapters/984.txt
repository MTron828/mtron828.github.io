Chapter 985 - The martial art god

[’Noob fighter’ losses]

How many times had Quinn seen this screen now? He had lost count. Due to him being a vampire, there wasn’t much sleep needed on his end, and the matches were ending relatively fast as well.

However, using no abilities, including that of the shadow and blood, limiting his physical abilities and having no beast gear proved to be a little too much of a disadvantage for Quinn.

However, it was safe to say it was working. Due to him not being able to rely on these things, he had to improve on the spot if he wanted to win. The only thing was. It was happening at a far slower pace than he had initially planned.

Quinn was losing matches using 30 percent of his strength. He thought the first few matches, his opponent might have been just strong, and eventually, he would find a way to beat them, but he never did and was getting tired of it.

In the next few games, Quinn decided that he would increase the limit by five percent each time until he eventually would win. At 35 percent his first match had hardly lasted longer than the others. He had, unfortunately, run into a speed user who was faster than him.

With Quinn’s current set of fighting skills, Quinn felt useless and was just frustrated. Soon after, he raised his stats to 40 percent. In his first match at this stage, he had lasted longer. His opponent had a growth ability, allowing them to grow the size of any part of their body and what they were touching at any point and time.

At this stage, Quinn was able to time his Flash Step perfectly to avoid the more vital attacks and had hit his opponents with well times hammer strikes and kicks, damaging the body well and eventually got a win.

It seemed at 40 percent the increase in strength had significantly helped, but this wasn’t what Quinn was hoping for. He stayed at the forty percent range, and eventually won a few fights, but after winning a few fights in a row, the matching system had put him against some tougher opponents, and Quinn ended up losing again.

When he had reached a stalemate, Quinn raised his stats once more to forty-five percent, thinking maybe it would change the outcome. Which it did, but not for the right reasons, going back to his old ways of relaying on speed and strength.

It seemed like the same pattern was occurring. Whenever Quinn would get stuck, he would just raise his limiter to beat his opponents and eventually, he had raised it to fifty percent. Winning nine fights in a row.

"No, this isn’t what I wanted," Quinn said while waiting in the white room, pausing, trying to reflect back on the fight that had just happened. "I haven’t really learnt any new fighting techniques, have I?"

"I would say so, but at the same time, I can’t blame you for raising your stats," Vincent replied. "It hasn’t been all for a lost cause. While forcing yourself to just use your body at that level, you used whatever you had to the max. I have never seen you have a better sense of timing, of when to attack and when to defend against your opponents.

"Which was why, whenever you raised your stats and went onto more difficult opponents, your fights seemed to be a lot easier. You are definitely improving, Quinn, but I would suggest you stop at fifty. From what I have gathered so far, at this point and stage, you should be able to defeat your opponents with this level of strength and speed."

Quinn agreed with Vincent, but it didn’t mean he was any less frustrated. Losing all the time wasn’t fun. He had a total of 32 wins while above three hundred losses on his record. As he got higher in the ranks, he was hoping that there would be those that fought better.

Instead, it was just those that were stronger with their abilities. There wasn’t much he could learn from them, other than timing and when to attack. He learned how to analyse patterns better and read certain movements, but there was only so much he could do.

Quinn wanted to improve his own combat skills but had no knowledge or anyone to teach him.

Most of Quinn’s current wins had happened while using fifty percent of his strength. Wanting to see how much he improved, Quinn decided that for the next fight, he would use no limiter at all. Even if he didn’t learn anything, he just wanted a break from the neck and neck fights.

At that moment, his opponent appeared in front of him. It was Chun once again, with the black armour and Dual axes.

’Hey, wait, it’s this guy again? Why am I fighting him?’ Chun thought.

After beating the Noob fighter last time, Chun had been on a winning streak. He had been doing so well, he even thought that he might make it into the top 100 anytime soon. Once again, Chun decided to have a look at Quinn’s stats.

’How many matches did this guy have after me, and look at how many losses he had. How bad is he?’ Chun thought. Still, having between him once, he felt he could do so again, and it would just be a free win for himself. If Quinn was facing him now, it also meant his opponent must have gotten several wins in a row as well.

When this happened, the system would deem the player too strong for the opponents it was matching them up against, and Quinn had won nine fights in a row at his current level.

On Quinn’s end, however, Quinn didn’t recognise the person. After all, he had fought so many people in a row and was hardly paying attention to what his opponent looked like. In the game, many people had similar avatars.

When the match started, Chun went to grab his axe, but looking up, he couldn’t see the person in front of him, and the next second he felt a punch hitting him right in the side of his face.

[Congratulations’ Noob Fighter’ is the winner]

"It looks like hundred percent of my strength is way too much, and I’m surprised the system was able to replicate my power. Still, it felt good to do that just once. I was starting to feel a little weak." Quinn said with an almost devilish smile on his face.

’What just happened?’ Chun thought. ’Did the game bug out.’

Instantly, Chun decided to rewatch the gameplay repeatedly, and he could see from the footage that his opponent had moved so fast and had hit him before he could do anything.

’That guy! I knew he was hiding an ability!’

[You have now entered the rankings]

[You have now taken the 100th spot]

This was indeed quite surprising to Quinn, that using fifty percent of his strength with no abilities, he could take one of the top hundred spots. Although he was a bad fighter, he had enough skills to beat most strong opponents through what he knew.

’But still, I’m going to be fighting the strongest of the strongest, there properly even stronger than any rank 1 on this game. I should at least be able to get this far.’ Quinn thought.

After reaching rank 100, Quinn was planning to take a small break, but then, there were quite a few requests for fights that had been sent his way.

’What is all this?’ Quinn thought as he was reading all the messages coming towards him. Soon he realised it was due to the public leaderboards. Now that Quinn was ranked a 100, anyone could see his name, select him and send him an invite.

’I guess one more fight won’t hurt.’ Quinn thought.

Looking through the messages, Quinn noticed that some of them had their rankings in brackets next to their name. The numbers close to him had asked for a match, but Quinn went through and looked for the highest number that had requested him to fight as he could and could see one of them stand out above the rest.

A person who was ranked fifty, and also had the name Martial Art God.

’Now, someone with a User ID has to be good at fighting, right? Why don’t we have a little go.’

Quinn thought as he sent his request out.

Due to Chun, having just lost his fight seconds ago, he was frustrated and had looked up to the Noob fighter he had lost to. Then when he saw the hundred ranking by his name, he felt like he could feel blood pouring from his ears.

’Wait, what! why is the martial art’s god, and this guy fighting against each other? Who accepts a match from someone fifty ranks above you!’ F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
