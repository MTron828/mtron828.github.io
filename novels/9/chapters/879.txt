Chapter 880: The vote for the crown

Usually, the vampire settlement would be filled with vampires going about doing their day to day business. Working in the marketplace, crafting arts and more, but today had been marked as a special event. It was almost like a public holiday to the vampires as they waited in their homes for the announcement to be made of who would be crowned next.

All the leaders had entered the vampire council room and had taken their seat, each with their vampire knights by their side. However, it felt a little odd in the room as it was emptier than it had been the last time they were there.

This was all because of a few empty seats and missing people in the room. The fourteenth seat at the end that would be accompanied by the head punisher, although that seat had been empty for years. The tenth seat that only recently got filled by its true leader, today there wasn‚Äôt even any of the tenth‚Äôs vampire knights, and finally the king‚Äôs seat along with the two vampire knights. On top of this, Bryce had only brought one leader with him, and it was the same for Lee.

Seeing this scene and display, the vampires couldn‚Äôt help but feel that their power had weakened during this generation and something needed to be done to get it restored. Standing up to address everyone, was none other than Bryce.

He often took care of the duties when the Royal knights were away, and in the past, with the king being frail and weak for a long period of time, they were used to Bryce doing this for a while now, and if there was one thing Bryce did know a lot about, it was the rules.

Which was why no one had a problem with his decision.

"First, to explain to everyone what we are here to do today," Bryce stated, placing his cane on the floor. What the other vampires did notice was that only one knight was with him, and Kazz was not present. Which was a first for Bryce.

"Based on the nominations made last time, there are only two that are in the running of becoming the next king. I, the first family leader, and Cindy, the second family leader. Unless anyone wishes to nominate themselves right now, or someone else they think is more suitable, then please speak now."

There was a moment of silence and odd glances around the room. Two of them came from both Muka and Jin, who looked at each other as if they were ready to do something, and they were as they had Quinn‚Äôs plan in mind, but nothing was spoken from them.

"Good," Bryce stated, stomping the cane on the floor. "Now, due to the situation with the tenth leader, we have agreed that the tenth family, will not be able to cast a vote. After all, we don‚Äôt know how involved him or his knights really are in this whole mess, so we are to do a vote with all the leaders present here. If there is a tie again, like last time, then we all know what will happen, but I hope through discussion we will be able to choose the right leader." Bryce explained.

"Further from that, once the king or Queen has been selected, they are free to choose two leaders to become their Royal knights, those leaders can choose to refuse or accept the position, but if there are no more volunteers, then the king will have the final say."

"Or Queen." Cindy interrupted, quite bravely as Bryce was in the middle of a speech, but she seemed confident and unafraid.

Nevertheless, Bryce continued without saying anything to Cindy, apart from a couple of glares.

"After the Royal knights have been selected, you must choose a time to make everyone aware of who will take your position of leader. I hope everyone has prepared their next leader already, just in case?‚Äô Bryce asked, looking around the room.

This was another reason why they were given a week. Because of this, a few of the castles needed to prepare a few things just in case they were elected as Royal knights. With a new king, it was time for a new generation, and it wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise if a few of the leaders decided to select a new leader and enter eternal sleep themselves. Although, maybe not with this group of leaders, as they all seemed more stubborn than ever.

What came as a surprise was that one leader had raised their hand, and that leader was the thirteenth leader, Lee.

Bryce nodded, showing that he was allowed to speak his turn.

"I wish to make a request. Although I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt be selected as a Royal knight, as I am not close to any of the contenders to be the next king or Queen. I was unable to prepare my next in line. As you all know, the one I wished to take my place no longer can, but I believe I do have a candidate that is not able to take that position at the moment. I wish to have Silver take my place as a leader and for you to lift the title of her being a vampire knight to allow me to do this."

The others were quite stunned at the request, not because the request was out of order but because of which family it had come from. The thirteenth family had always had a male as a leader. It was tradition, and even Lee wished to follow this tradition with him. But now, he had requested to change it.

"I don‚Äôt think there will be a problem, but I think we will have to wait for the new council to decide when it has been formed. If they agree, Silver will be stripped of her title as vampire knight, and then you are free to name whoever you want as your successor."

A small short smile appeared on Lee‚Äôs face after hearing these words. He was ready to right every wrong he had done in his family. Although, the smile soon disappeared as he was worried just what Silver was up to.

At the same time, this move was done, as a way to protect her. Now that he had made his intentions clear, it would be a bigger deal if someone was to try and harm Silver. Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

"If that is all done, then I believe we should get on with the Vote," Bryce stated. "I hope you have thought hard and well over who will be the next best leader. First myself, those in favour of me, Bryce Cain becoming the first leader, please raise your hand."

Slowly, hands started to rise in the room. The 3rd family, Suzan, the 6th family leader from the Muscat family, Kyle from the 7th family and Prima from the 12th family, but after there were no more hands raised. In total, there were only four people that had voted for Bryce, which meant that there would be a winner declared today.

As for the person who had previously nominated Bryce but didn‚Äôt vote for him this time, that was none other than the 8th leader Jill.

Everyone could see that this was unexpected for Bryce, as the cane started to shake under his hands. He was boiling with anger at the unexpected turn from his side, but he bit his tongue and kept his cool, not saying anything.

"Very well, all those who wish to vote for Cindy Cha, please raise their hand." Bryce asked, and Sunny, David, and Lee from the 5th, 11th and 12th family had raised their hands first. After a short while, the expected turner raised their hand, Jill from the 8th family.

All that was needed was the last two votes, and both Jin and Muka looked at each other and raised their hand.

‚ÄôIt looks like Quinn‚Äôs guess was right‚Äô, Jin thought.

‚ÄôI really don‚Äôt want to do this, but for now, it will be okay until we find out the truth. We shall use your plan, Quinn!‚Äô Muka thought.

"Me, the ninth leader and Jin the fourth leader, have decided that we would like to Vote for Bryce to become the next vampire king," Muka said out loud.

The other leaders turned and looked at the both of them. They had no clue this was planned, and it was an unexpected turn of events for nearly all of them. Jill had a look of great anger on her face as her first was clenched, but Cindy quickly gave her a look, calming her down.

With the change of votes, it had finally been decided that Bryce, the first leader, would become the next vampire king, and there was nothing the other side could do to stop it.
