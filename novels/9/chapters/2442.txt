Winter Wonderland

Everyone's eyes widened as they turned around to have a look at the sudden noise in the room. They were in a relatively small confined space and there was only one way for them to enter the cave. 

Even then, they would have to either climb in, or fly in which they should have been able to have seen, yet no one there did, and somehow four intruders had entered the room. Not only that, but one of them was nearly large enough that the top of their head was hitting the ceiling of the cave. 

"It's the demons!" Hikel shouted. "They've managed to find us!"

The markings on Hikel's body started to light up, but he hesitated in attacking using his ability. If he was to do a full attack now, then the whole place would crumble and fall, possibly trapping Quinn as well.

The first person to make a move was Peter, he would protect Quinn no matter what and if these people knew where they were then it meant they were all doomed. As he set off his body transformed mid strike, his head tail wrapping around his arm for an ultimate punch. 

Turning to his right, Calva's arm was already transformed into a giant bone shield. The fist hit dead in the centre of the shield and Calva's arm was sent jerking back a bit, but he managed to push back.

'The demon was able to match Peter's power!' Hikel thought. 'As I thought, there are plenty of strong ones like what we matched earlier, this is going to be hard.' 

At the same time, Calva was thinking something similar. 

'What type of strength is that, who are these people, are they demons?'

The two of them grunted in a power struggle and at the same time they opened their mouths wide. 

"I will not be defeated by a demon!" They shouted in unison. 

The bone shield started to transform, closing like a flower and trapping Peter's arm. Calva, had been ready, he was ready to face whatever he needed to after escaping from Quinn's shadow. 

After all, there was a high chance that Immortui had already defeated Quinn and he was just watching over him, or at least the ones watching over him will be strong enough to do so. 

With his other hand, he had a large bone sword, it was extremely sharp and jagged toward the end like a tooth. The sword was swung against Peter, seeing an opening, even if he blocked it with his hand the sword would slice right through it. 

From behind, a strange flexible object came out fast and hit it away. The strange object attached to his opponent's head was deflecting Calva's sword. The two were hitting against each other again and again

Peter was using his second head tail to defend against the sharp attacks and they were both going at it at full speed. 

'What is going on, my hand feels completely stuck, and if I pull I can feel it starting to rip part of my arm.' Peter thought, not that he was so worried since he could just heal and arm back, but he was more amazed at the strength. 

"Everyone stop!" Sil said, as he teleported next to the three Skully's that had yet to do anything. For a moment, everything froze, that was until Peter forcefully pulled on his arm, it ripped out of the trapped bones, and with his arm free he was ready to throw out another punch, until Sil with his own powers chucked a ball of wind that hit his fist at the same time. 

It wasn't enough to stop Peter if he went through with the punch, but was enough to show him that Sil was serious when he told everyone to stop. 

"Can't you see, these guys aren't demons?" Sil said.

"Aren't demons?" Russ quizzed, looking at the Skullys' faces. "They have f*cking skulls on top of their heads, that's the most demon thing I've seen."

Calva glancing, and looking at the situation was starting to get an idea of what was going on. He could see Quinn on the floor, all of them in a cave, and there was one whose energy felt similar to Quinn's. 

Although he felt like he might be able to fight his way out of the current situation, he didn't think it was the best thing to do.

"We're not demons." Calva said. " I jumped the gun, I thought you were with Immortui, and you… you are a demon." 

When saying those words, Calva was looking toward Hikel. Even if they had the same energy as Quinn, they were still creations of Immortui and in the first place Calva didn't know much about the demon race of vampires, who they followed, or the role of importance that Quinn held. 

Mentioning the word Immortui, he thought he was making his position clear, so he needed to be ready to fight or run. 

"With those scary freaking faces I don't think you should be pointing fingers and be calling anyone a demon." Russ commented.

"These guys." Sil said. "We saw them being killed by the demons before we saved Quinn. We're pretty sure they're natural inhabitants, and if my guess is right, they didn't just come out of nowhere, but they popped out of Quinn's shadow space."

"Yeah!" Anon said, his voice shaky. He was worried for more reasons than one. The champions were known as the strongest the inhabitants had to offer, and Calva was the strongest Skully to ever exist. 

What he had just witnessed was a crazy person rip his arm off, and go one on one with the Champion. Not only that, but the person that had appeared behind them for some reason Anon didn't feel like he was any weaker than the other attacker. 

Where did all these powerful people come from all of a sudden?

"We were in this space, Quinn put us in it, it was completely black, he did it to protect us… who are you guys?" 

That had been enough confirmation for Sil, and with him giving the go ahead the rest thought it had to be true as well. Mainly because they were unsure how they would have gotten in the cave otherwise. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Sil had decided to do all of the talking, since they were more calm around him compared to the others that were hostile with them moments ago. He explained that they were friends of Quinn's but he could see that they wanted a lot more answers than that. 

It was clear that they weren't inhabitants so they explained a little more, how they weren't from this world, and had travelled with Quinn here in order to take down Immortui. 

It felt quite unbelievable, but for the Skullys, to them it was the most reasonable explanation. 

How could people they never knew that were so strong appear at once, unless they were from another world. After they had done all the explaining it was time for the Skullys. 

They first explained what happened, how they were on the battlefield with Quinn, and what happened before Immortui arrived.  How he had managed to take out a demon king. 

"So Quinn met with someone on the same level as Unzoku before he fought against Immortui?" Hikel was stunned, he knew Quinn was impressive, but just how strong was he?

"You met Unzoku!" Calva was equally surprised, if they had met a demon king, they would have fought and they would have all met their fate. If they managed to survive and were here, it meant they all had a high level of strength. 

"I see, I guess Quinn had some reliable and strong friends after all. I guess he didn't know you guys followed him, otherwise he would have never made us make that promise."

"What promise?" Peter asked. 

Calva spelled it out for them, the request that Quinn had made before he had gone to face Immortui. What he said he needed in order to win the battle. 

"He… needs the blood of five demon kings." Hikel said. "Five that are just as strong as Unzoku." 

"But, I said I will help, so I will do so." 

Calva went into detail about who he was, and who the champions were as well, including the history of their universe. There was a reason for him saying all of this, just like Anon, Calva thought that getting the help of the other Champions would help them. 

Hearing this news, Hikel and Russ thought back to the other Champion they had met up with, his power was strong but the demons had a tight leash on them.

"Some might consider them stronger." Calva replied. "The good news is we only need four now, but it will be no easy task." 

Calva didn't need to mention that fact, they all knew it would be difficult and even now with all of them together, they were trying to figure out just how it would be possible, especially while trying to avoid the attention of Immortui. The question was, was it even possible?
