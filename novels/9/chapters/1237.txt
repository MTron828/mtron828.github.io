Chapter 1238 A little help

When Vicky had shouted out the ability name Second chance, Raten, Vorden and Sil had no clue what she was talking about. In the first place, they were the youngest members of the main Blade family, so they had yet to learn all the secrets like the others.

The original plan had been for Sil to return after two years of military service. Once he had gotten 'fixed' Hilston would have proceeded with whatever his plan had been. However, the plan needed adjustment, since there had been no improvement in Sil and then the start of the Civil war had messed things up even further. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, given the name of the ability itself and the worry he had heard coming from Vicky's voice gave him enough of an idea about what the ability would be able to do. The user of that ability would be granted a second chance at life. It was an incredibly powerful ability that they had discovered, even with the drawback that it could only be used once every twenty four hours.

The reason why not everyone in the Blade family used this ability was not only because it would limit the number of abilities they could functionally use, but also due to the high amount of MC cells it required. In the Blade family's case, this was a good thing.

Alas, Hilston Blade had now been killed for a second time within this twenty four hour frame period and even without such a cooldown, Sil had made sure to destroy his brain this time. The headless body of the strongest human dropped to the floor, revealing Slicer.

Just like Graham, she could be counted as an outlier amongst the Dalki, so she didn't succumb to her urges of needing to kill a human. Instead, she was more true to her primal desire of wanting to evolve by fighting strong opponents.

She had been surprised to see that the person she fought for so long, had miraculously been able to revive, only for him to be killed by his killer for a second time. However, while her interest in Hilston had faded, with Sil demonstrating his strength, she couldn't help but want to fight him. For all Slicer knew, he could prove to be the final push she lacked to reach an even higher form.

The female Dalki went ahead and swung her colossal tail, attempting to cut the newcomer down. Reacting, Sil hardened his body, but his defense was ineffective. The tail continued to go through his arm that was even able to best the Demon tier armour.

'This hardening ability is supported by the MC cells of six people put together, yet it's still going through so easily!' Watching the fight, and being in the fight were two different things. Now Sil himself was experiencing the power of a five spike Dalki, who was on the verge of death but also her next evolution.

"Sil, use your lightning powers now!" Vicky shouted.

The voice was familiar, so Sil took their advice. However, there was nothing he could do about the arm, Slicer had claimed for her own. From the forearm onwards it had fallen to the ground, but with the other hand, Sil used his lightning ability.

"This tickles!" Slicer shouted. "The old man's power was the same."

Running through the sand were Pai and Vicky holding hands, and they too fired off their lightning abilities, hitting Slicer again, pushing her far back and away. That wasn't the only attack that hit her.

A blade made of mud attacked a wound on Slicer's left side, while another two balls of wind hit Slicer from the right. Raten, and Vorden had also left to join the fight.

"We have to help out!" Fex shouted, since the rest had stayed by the sand dune.

"No!" Sam shouted. "That five spike is too strong. Right now, all of them have run out because of their emotional attachment, not thinking things through. That Dalki may be on its last legs, but it also means it's at its strongest right now. I won't let all of you lose your lives!"

It was then they could see Slicer shouting in rage, and swinging her two tail whips around, cutting the lightning attacks, while also disrupting the mud blade and wind attacks.

"Alright, I'll kill you all then!" She shouted, but there was one more person who had yet to join in, appearing directly in front of Slicer who could see a fist in front of her face.

"Don't mess with my family!" Borden screamed, putting all his anger and strength into this punch. Seeing Sil's hand on the floor infuriated him, and more so than anyone he knew the strength of the Dalki firsthand.

When the punch landed, Slicer's face turned to the side for a second, and from the corner of her eye, she could see who, or what had just hit her.

"You're a Dalki, yet you dare lay your filthy hands on me!" Slicer shouted, swinging her colossal tail against him, but before it hit Borden, Sil grabbed him and moved him out of the way just in time.

‚Äî‚Äî

Still, the sight of what had just happened had been seen by everyone who watched the livestream.

"That‚Ä¶was that a Dalki? Was it just me or did I see a Dalki go up against that five spiked one? Just what is going on?"

"I saw it too, it had scales and spikes and everything. It was a four spiked Dalki!"

"Why are the Dalki helping the Cursed faction?! See, I told you all that they really are working together! But why are they fighting against the five spiked Dalki? I'm so confused right now."

"Does it really matter what's going on? Maybe it's just an ability or something. As long as that five spike dies here, I'll support the Cursed faction. She has to be on her last legs and I don't care what happens but they just need to beat her!"

‚Äî‚Äî

It was strange, Borden with his rising anger had managed to summon four spikes, and deliver a punch to the Slicer, but it had accomplished virtually nothing. It was the first time for his strength to be lacking. It was then that the realisation had set in, of what a mistake they all had made.

"Sil! You're fast right, we can't beat her! I thought maybe with all of us we could do something but we have to get out of here!"

Even with the rest of the Blade family present, they were all unsure if they could beat the Dalki in front of them.

‚Äî‚Äî

Inside the command centre, Graham, watching everything, had a concerned look on his face, but when turning to look at Quinn, it had changed to a smile.

"It's brilliant, right? This strange man of the Blade family was not something that had been within our calculations. He proved to be far stronger than I could have ever expected. Perhaps he could have even been a hope to those humans. Yet, isn't it ironic that another human caused him to fall in battle?"

"Even in desperate times, humans are incapable of working together. Truly fascinating. If maybe all of these had helped, during the fight, Slicer would have been defeated, but now they have no one that can be a match against her." Graham stated with confidence.

Listening and watching the whole thing, Quinn found one thing weird, the look on his face just seconds ago. Something had to be up.

'Could it be that this female Dalki really is on her last legs?' Quinn wondered.

"I still don't know why you decided to betray us, but for you to not be the only one. It is something I will need to look into. And there is something that seems off about that four spiked Dalki. Perhaps I should ask Slicer to bring back its corpse once she is done with them." Graham walked up to the glass container staring at Quinn, he looked closer, as if he was expecting some type of reaction.

"The fight isn't over yet. They just need a little more help." Quinn said, as he closed his eyes.

Seconds later, and a beeping sound echoed throughout the room. Turning to his machine Graham could see that something had happened to his 'guest'. A moment later and a flatline was displayed.

'Did he just kill himself after saying those words?' Graham wondered about the strange behaviour. 'No, none of us should have the ability to just kill ourselves in such a fast manner either. The words were also too confident and he never kept his eyes off the screen. ‚Ä¶ It shouldn't be possible!'

'Slicer, she needs to get out of there NOW!'

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Sam was worried about Sil and the others, and he could tell that Fex wanted to run out there and help, but the two of them wouldn't be able to do a single thing against the beast. It was then that Sam could see Quinn in front of them all.

Quinn was now standing opposite Slicer.

"Another insect has joined the battle!" She growled.

[Demon tier Amulet has finished transferring energy]

[Soul weapon activated Shadow Overload]

"Everyone, in another fascinating turn of events, the Cursed faction leader, Quinn Talen, has now joined the fight against the five spiked Dalki!" Bonny reported.
