Chapter 941 - An old castle down, a new one in its place

Finally, the time for the meeting had come, and the three from the tenth family that were due to attend were on their way. In order to avoid the commotion outside and being spotted by the other vampires, Quinn had decided to use his shadow travel and brought along both Leo and Paul as asked.

While using the shadow travel, Quinn noticed that he no longer felt like his MC points were draining. It was as if a specific part of his body no longer got tired when using it.

’So this is what having over a thousand MC points feels like?’ Quinn thought. One of his main problems with using the shadow ability was how much MC each skill would use, it seemed to be more taxing compared to other abilities, but now Quinn could finally use his skills in more ways without having to worry.

While on the way there, Quinn’s mind started to wander and focus on something else. It was the question Paul had asked not too long ago.

’About Paul’s request, it should be possible, right?’ Quinn asked. This was something Quinn had never really thought about himself, but it must have been natural for those who had been turned unwillingly to want to be turned back.

However, for Quinn, it was a new power, he always treated it like an ability and it was because he had become a vampire his whole life had changed. It was now a part of him. What used to be problems and difficulties were no longer there. Although he did miss the taste of normal food now and then.

’What makes you think that?’ Vincent replied.

’When I lived your life, you placed your powers away in that book, you used your ability so you could become human and live with....’ Quinn stopped there as he realised that talking about old memories may have not been the best or politest thing to do. It felt natural for Quinn because he had lived Vincent’s life.

At the end of the day, Vincent never told him these things, and the two of them had never directly talked about Vincent’s past before.

’That was due to my ability, the equivalent exchange ability. This is something that you don’t have, Quinn. Perhaps there would have been something that could have been done, if I was still alive.’ Vincent replied.

’Yes, but there are others with the same ability, remember. Some that are still out there even now.’ Quinn replied, referring to the possibility of the original leader Richard Eno, and Jim. ’So apart from that, is there any other way? After thousands of years, did they never figure something out.’

Quinn didn’t hear from Vincent for a while, as he must have been thinking of something, and he eventually replied.

’Not that I know of, I’m not saying it’s impossible. I’m just saying even when I was alive there was no research put towards such a thing. Even Vampires that think they must protect humans see themselves above them, so why would they ever want to become one of them?’

’But you did.’ Quinn replied.

’I know, but I was certainly a special case. When I decided to, I used what tools I had available at the time. Anyway, my point is, there hasn’t been any research done, which is why I said not that I know of. Perhaps after my time someone has done something. I’ll be honest there is one family that might know the answer. The second family."

It was an unexpected answer for Quinn.

’Did you remember when Leo told you about the subclasses that they found. What interests me is how they even created such subclasses? There are only two ways to create a subclass. Either be born, this means one of their parents would have needed to be a subclass, or the second, is to turn a human. They had far too many subclasses for me to believe that they were born.’

Vincent certainly had a point, and it was something Quinn had never thought of before. But with Cindy dead, who was there to ask? Still, he had made a promise and he would certainly pop the question.

Arriving at the King’s castle the normal checks had been done, and it was time for the three of them to be led on inside.

’Well, at least the guards aren’t acting strange like last time. Were some of them working for Cindy, or was it something else?’ Quinn wondered.

When Quinn finally arrived, the large wide doors were opened and the usual council room could be seen, although what he hated was the fact that it seemed like everyone was already there before him, and he was once again the center of attention.

’Why is it, every time I come here, they look at me?’

Although this time, it was for a different reason. Those that were there and had seen Quinn fight. They were reminded of his power and those who weren’t had heard what he had done. Somehow a leader was able to go toe to toe with one that had the absolute blood power.

In a way, some of them felt fear, as they believed that this might be the coming of a second Arthur.

As Quinn walked past his seat, and his two knights stood by his side. He realised that there were some new faces in the room, and not just that, but Jill was not sitting in her seat. Instead she was standing by Bryce’s side, her hands kept together, her back straight.

The most noticeable thing was her eyes. They lacked any form of emotion in them. It was as if she had now become a doll.

Following Quinn behind, Leo’s attention wasn’t focused on the same thing as Quinn. Instead, he was feeling all the different energies in the room, and there was one in the room that was slightly different from the rest.

A detail that only his ability could pick up, and even Quinn with his Qi control might not have noticed.

’The man, in the second seat? Is he like the one from before?’ Leo thought. The person he was talking about was the original vampire Tempus.

"Now that the tenth leader has finally arrived we can begin this meeting." Bryce said, hitting his new cane on the floor once. A habit of his when he was leader but now he could do it even more so as King.

"There are many things that we are to discuss on the agenda, and I will go through them all. Once I have spoken the council table will be open for discussion about certain topics. I hope the recent events haven’t made us forget what the courtesy and rules are in the council room."

The others nodded, including Quinn.

For some reason, he thought he would have felt nervous, but right now, Quinn was feeling quite calm. He was reminded of the first time he had come into the council room, how big everyone looked and the energy pouring out of them. Now though, he didn’t feel afraid of them.

His calm demeanour also didn’t go unnoticed, and it was putting the leaders next to him a little at unease.

"First I would like to introduce you to the new leaders that you see around you. First of all, we should all pay our respects to the new second Leader, Tempus Cha." When introducing him, even Bryce bowed down which Quinn thought was strange.

’Quinn, that’s another original!’ Vincent said.

Still, Quinn didn’t act as if he was surprised. He knew something was up when he entered the room. There were only three people that were completely calm, their heartbeat beating as if it was just any other day. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

These people were, Quinn himself, Bryce and finally Tempus.

"Tempus is the new second family leader, and he said he will do everything he can to build up the second family and right the wrongs his family has committed." Bryce continued to explain.

"Next we have the new leaders replacing the seats that have been vacant for a while. From the seventh family, we have new Leader, Harlu Dawn." When his name was announced the young man stood up.

"After that, we have replacing the new twelfth leader, Kim Killton."

This time, a female vampire stood up, who had quite the baby face. As she had smooth chubby cheeks and wore quite young clothing. It was quite clear to Quinn which vampires were from a new generation and which were from an old.

It seemed like Leaders were a thing hardly replaced. Even if their face remained young their fashion sense stayed the same.

The new leaders gave a little speech stating what they planned to do to improve the family, and a little bit about their background, but what Quinn was concerned about was that no one stood by the eighth seat, where Jill should have been.

"As you may have noticed, the eighth seat is empty, and Jill is standing by my side. Now that all the past leaders no longer exist, including the original, we have decided that there will no longer be an eighth family anymore. The Original leader has betrayed the vampire settlement and I believe they no longer deserve to be a part of the council. This is the punishment the eighth family must bear."

Hearing this, the room was a little unsettled by the design.

"Moving on, the next agenda I would like to talk about, is bringing back the fourteenth castle."
