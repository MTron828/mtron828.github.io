Chapter 2505 Luce vs Russ

The demon king Luce stood there in his full white form. He had been unharmed by Hikel's attempt, and in the process, Hikel had lost his arms. It was a wasted effort in trying to finish the demon off. Without his arms, he would now be far weaker than before.

Still, Russ, having seen the power of what Hikel was capable of, knew that his explosive power or his suicide attack had to be strong. Otherwise, why would Luce transform into his demon form?

Having absorbed the large white wall of power, this gave Russ an idea. Thanks to his god slayer-tier item, he now had more MC cells than he had ever before. With his hands placed on the ground, two Hikels were summoned.

'If just two simple arms managed to cause that big of an explosion, then let's see what two complete Hikels blowing up will do!'

Both of the Hikels that had been made rushed forward and leapt right towards Luce. Their whole bodies started to light up, and seeing this, both Hikel and Peter thought they might be in trouble.

Out from the ground next to Peter, one of the four familiar Kings appeared. Giving off its mystic blue smoke was none other than Dunluck. Pete grabbed Hikel and threw him onboard while getting on himself, and the two scattered away in a hurry.

With each step Dunluck took, he was gliding in the air, getting far away.

'Don't you think we should help Russ?' Hikel said.

'You've been around him long enough, do you think he did this attack with the idea of protecting ourselves in mind?' Peter replied back.

It was true; right now, Russ had also summoned the shadow power and was ready to protect himself from the backfire of the explosion. And sure enough, both of them exploded, this time using their whole bodies with such force. A giant mushroom cloud, two right next to each other, had almost combined into one far larger than before. The whole surface of the planet felt like it was shaking. A giant deep crater had been made that pushed so far down that lava was now spewing out from the ground, and nearly the whole forest had been eliminated.

Peter and Hikel had managed to travel out of the area, almost heading right back to the mountain where they were before, and when they turned around, nearly the entire forest had been destroyed. It looked nothing like it once had.

'This is the power that I'm now able to achieve, with the blood control and my ability,' Hikel thought.

However, it wasn't quite right. There were two of him, for one, and there was something else that Hikel wasn't accounting for. Although the explosion was large in size, it wasn't more powerful. There was a limit to how powerful his explosions would be, which was why, in the centre of all the mess, was what looked like a giant egg. It looked like the same thing that Peter was trapped in not too long ago.

The outside started to descend down, and Luce was seen coming out of the large crater created by the explosion, completely unharmed.

'Your power is really interesting, but you failed to notice the real power that had come from the last attack,' Luce claimed. 'I did not change into this demon form because I thought I would get hurt.'

Due to the large explosion, it had caught the attention of many of the Divine beings in the area. A large flock of them were flying in the air and heading toward the group, just like before.

They were appearing behind Luce, but he did not turn around. When they got close, out from his own body from his back, several lines were extending out. It was similar to the giant wall, only they were coming out of his back. They were going through the air fast, moving in a straight line. When the Divine beings tried to avoid it, it followed them in the quickest route possible until each one of them was pierced in the body, almost at the same time.

The attack spread out after killing one and continued to branch out, going into the others. Almost growing out from his back was what looked like a tree of death, since every single one of the Divine beings in the air had been pierced, and their bodies were starting to disappear.

'I transformed because I wanted to finish the task quickly,' Luce stretched out his hand, and from his power, it stretched out, aiming toward Russ. Seeing this, he did what he usually did and moved his god-slayer hand in the way, hoping to absorb the energy.

When it touched, though, the white substance went straight through his hand, piercing through his skin, and it was continuing forward toward his head.

'What... my god-slayer item, it didn't absorb the power!' Russ was stunned, and just before the attack reached him, shadows appeared, blocking its path.

'Your little thing is quite amazing, the items and tools you have, but they're easy to figure out,' Luce stated. 'You can draw enemies from attacks and projectiles out of the body. With the sword, you can even stop abilities, but this is not the same as the power before. In my demon form, my power is me, and you can't just vanish my body or absorb my body away!'

Pulling out the sword with his other hand, Russ swung, attempting to cut the white line of power. As it hit, it made a cut; it sliced through it, breaking it off and allowing Russ to back away. But just as Luce said, it didn't make the rest of him or the attack disappear.

'It didn't disappear. It just cut part of him like any other sword would have done.'

'That sword is very interesting!' Luce exclaimed, seeing this. His power wouldn't have been able to be cut by a regular sword, which made him wonder just what that was.

With his hand full of blood, and Russ backed away, he was wondering what to do next. Did he try to use his own power against him? Did he summon an army to try to take him on? It just felt like if he attempted any of that, then he would just kill all of them.

Russ gripped his hand on the sword tighter and lifted it, pointing it at Luce.

'It's a shame... I really didn't want to use him again. I got quite the headache last time, and it just doesn't sit too well with me because it doesn't feel like I'm the one that's going to kill you. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to be happy with your defeat.'

Looking into the mind of the sword, a dark ring appeared around Russ's feet, and glowing power started to rise from below. It was pure, covering him completely until it faded away, and now stood there in Russ' place, holding the black sword in his hand, was a larger man, muscular with long black hair. The top half of his body on display while his bottom just covered and wrapped by a tattered black cloth. It was the Black Swordsman.
