Chapter 905 - Leo's little friend

The group continued to travel being directed by Leo. They passed many giant mushrooms that were as large as trees, that had yellow or green tints. Small little familiar bugs scurried everywhere across the floor.

Eventually, they no longer needed Leo to guide them because they could see many of the creatures heading a certain way. It was as if they all hurried towards a big event to the point that they all ignored these outsiders.

Just then, Nate saw what resembled a large deer go past them, but it didn’t look like just any regular old deer. This one had antlers that were two times the size of its body towering over it’s head.

"So are familiars something all vampires can get?" Nate asked, after developing an interest in the surrounding creatures.

"It seems to require a certain aptitude, yet there are not many who want one in the first place." Silver replied. "Vampire knights can choose to connect with a familiar through a ceremony, which opens the link between this world and our world. We offer them a drop of our blood, so they can sense our power."

"The familiars are not supposed to reveal the secrets of their world, so while we don’t really know things for certain we can speculate. Those familiars that wish to form a bond, will fight over each other and the winner eventually forms the contract with the vampire who had initiated the ceremony."

"Then what about your brother? How come he’s got that flying bull when he’s not a vampire knight?" Nate questioned.

Hearing this, Fex touched his earring as it started to vibrate a little. Ham clearly knew they were talking about him.

’So you’re my familiar, huh, I wonder how I got you?’

"As a rite of passage direct descendants also go through a ceremony to connect with a familiar. The chances for one appearing are quite low, although there have been cases when direct descendants managed to get familiars later on in their life, despite none appearing during that first ceremony. It’s unclear why, and the most popular theory in that regard is that either one can somehow gain the necessary aptitude to summon one."

"Rarely there are also cases where familiars appear on their own in our world. We don’t really know how this happens but they also can connect with vampires of their choosing. My brother is such a special case, where Ham appeared on his own before Fex came of age for the rite of passage." Silver explained.

"That being said, I can see that you seem to d.e.s.i.r.e to contract one, but you really shouldn’t. The reason they are not popular even among regular vampires who would be able to connect with familiars is because many have died because of their familiars."

"They are quite strange. Each one is unique when deciding what they are attracted to. When you make a contract it’s almost as if you don’t hold up your end of the deal, it will try to kill you."

Listening to Silver speak, and looking at the familiars, Nate was wondering just how strong they were? He knew that beasts had their own power ranking with some having almighty power, so was it the same for these familiars? If they could kill vampires then they had to have some strength, and the Boneclaw from earlier was definitely stronger than himself.

It was safe to say, if they did get into a fight, underestimating the familiars was not a good idea. Their journey so far had been relatively safe, although they saw many different types of familiars pass by them and come up close through the mushroom forest, not one of them seemed to be aggressive. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

’So Ham, is this really the world where you came from?’ Fex asked, wanting to know more about his little companion that had helped him.

’Kinda." Ham replied. ’Our world is large, and this is the first time I’ve been to this area. Besides, I hardly come back here. When I’m resting in your earring, I can choose to see what you see, or head back here until you call me, but I choose to look after my master. Besides, your world is way more interesting than anything that is going on here.’

’Then do you have any idea why all the familiars are going somewhere?’ Fex asked.

’I have no idea, but maybe they felt something. I could come out and try to see, but I’m a little worried that If I do come out of the earring then I will act just like them, and what if I get split up from you again?’ Ham replied.

It was clear that Ham and Fix shared a good bond. It looked like he would have to treat his little familiar to something once they returned.

Suddenly, vibrations through the ground could be felt, the mushrooms heads seemed to shrivel slightly as if they were reacting to what was happening. The vibrations continued one after another as if something large was walking.

It was clear whatever it was had quite some weight to it, which was strange considering the size they had seen of everything before, but then they all could finally see what was heading their way.

Towering over the giant mushrooms was a creature of titanic proportions. It walked on all fours and was three times bigger than an African elephant. What was most notable was it’s long winding neck like that of the old dinosaurs and its large single ready eye with two horns sticking out of its head.

"That things enormous!" Nate couldn’t help but say. "If that was a beast it looks like it would at least be a demon tier beast! It’s almost as big as the giant crab we fought."

"How foolish are you?" Asked Silver. "You can’t base everything on size alone. There are plenty of beasts that are small yet far more powerful than you would think, so just because one is large doesn’t mean it has the strength or speed to match it."

It was very true, especially since humanoid beasts that were the same size as humans were said to be the strongest. Still, even though Silver spoke her words, she had to admit there did seem to be some strong power radiating off of it, as it glowed more than the others and the floating balls were quickly being absorbed by the large beast.

In the middle of their small argument, once again they felt something pulling away from their bodies. Their heads started to feel light headed and then another ball of energy escaped from each and every one of them.

By now, the beast wasn’t too far away from them, and the ball of glowing energy that had left their bodies, started to immediately head towards the large beast. Just like all the other balls of energy, it’s large body absorbed them and it started to glow.

However, as soon as it did, it looked down to where the energy had come from.

"It seems to like the taste, and now wants seconds!" Fex started to panic.

The long neck started to swoop down towards them, diving down like a snake flying through the air. Seeing this, each one of them relied on themselves, but they were all feeling a little weak after just having some of their energy taken away from them.

’If I fight using Qi, then it will only mean my demise will be quicker.’ Leo thought about grabbing his sword, trying to think of the best option, but it seemed like he wouldn’t need to act.

The energy that had been following them, the small but powerful energy started to hop between the smaller mushrooms. Going from one to the other at a great speed. It eventually hopped onto the largest mushroom in the area, and when the beast’s head was close, it leapt up to meet it.

"What’s that little black thing?" Nate asked.

It was quite hard to see from a distance, but what was obvious was the size difference. It looked like a mouse going up against a cat, when finally a small paw was placed on the giant familiar’s head. A pulse of energy was felt as ripples were seen going through the air, sending the beast’s head away.

The small black object landed back on the mushrooms and it looked like the large family was now continuing off on its way to where it was going once before.

’Did that little thing just save us?’ Nate wondered.

The small black object started to hop from mushroom to mushroom, and eventually was running towards the group, noticing that they got startled and got ready for battle.

"Don’t draw your weapons! It’s not planning to hurt us!" Leo held them back.

They were unsure though, but it wasn’t like they could stop it if they could, as it ran past all of them, only to hop on the top of Leo’s shoulder.

Soon, sat on top of Leo’s bald head, seemingly claiming the spot for itself.

"Meow." The cat went, l.i.c.k.i.n.g it’s paw.

"A cat?" Fex blurted out, able to see that familiar was a black cat, with big eyes, and a small red slit down the middle of it’s forehead.

"Well, it looks like someone wants to make a contract?" Silver pointed out, giving Leo a smile.
