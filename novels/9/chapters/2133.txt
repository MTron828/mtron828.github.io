It was a simple move, Quinn hadn't done anything too fancy, he hadn't used his Qi or blood aura nor any of his abilities. What he had simply displayed to the others was his natural vampire strength, which was enough to deal with this level of beast.

There was a fine line when showing one's powers. He needed to show he had great strength, but too strong and people around, even different races, would start to feel threatened and scared.

Turning his head, to look at the other two, Quinn was starting to have second thoughts.

'Did I show them too much?' Quinn thought.

Jun and Zallack stood there, with their mouths wide open. If they were left open any longer they would touch the floor. A beast being dealt with just pure power, it wasn't completely foreign to them.

There were strong alien races that could do the same, but Quinn had also done it in one movement, and against a fast beast at that. One didn't just need strength but the speed to match it as well, which was why the two were so shocked.

'I was right‚Ä¶ this person.' Jun thought, he soon shook his head, as he noticed the beast was moving its back legs trying to get out of the situation.

"The beast is not dead, the crystal is located in its forehead." Jun answered, trying to give him a hand. Afterall, he wanted to be in his good books. When they got back, Jun would do a lot for Zallack for showing him this treasure.

The truth was, Quinn had held back a bit for another reason, he didn't want to kill the beast, he wanted to do something else.

'I guess, I don't have to worry if they see, I can use my powers here.'

Soon shadow started to emit from Quinn's hand, and it started to surround the beast completely.

"Don't be scared with what you are about to see, as I said before we have hunted beasts many times." Quinn stated.Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

The shadow soon started to disappear and now, the beast looked different from before. It was no longer fighting back, part of its fur was starting to fall off from its body, and they weren't so sure but small parts of it looked like it had a strange purple shadow substance lingering over it.

'The Shadow Infect was successful, I ran a few tests before, so maybe this will be a good way to find a nest crystal.'

With the beast having been shadow infected, Quinn ordered it to act, and it immediately went to the closest beast next to it. Now the two were in the middle of combat, fighting against each other.

"What's happened, has the beast gone mad‚Ä¶ or are you controlling it?" Jun asked.

"The latter would be more accurate." Quinn answered. "Which is why I told you not to worry too much. Thank you for being our guide and helping us."

After finishing his sentence, the beast was done dealing with the other, and soon it looked the same as the attacker. This was one of the traits of the Shadow Infect skill, it not only made the beast stronger but it was able to infect other beasts as well.

He was slowly, on an unknown planet, building up his army bit by bit.

"Ceril, Russ, fight the beasts in this area, but make sure you don't kill them. Just injure them enough until I come along." Quinn ordered.

The next few minutes, both Jun and Zallack had their minds blown, as they witnessed the forest-like jungle being cleared of beasts, although cleared wasn't the right word. Because every time a beast would be taken over, it would follow along with them as they moved to the next spot.

If anyone saw this sight, all of the beasts walking together, they would be shaking in their boots, unsure if they would live to see another day.

"Who are these people from Earth, are they some type of warrior race?" Zallack asked. "How can an alien race be so strong? This would require a few professional teams to do this. Are you not worried Jun, what are these people doing on our planet? Why are such strong beings here!"

Honestly it would have been a lie if Jun said he wasn't worried, because as they continued to follow the three, the army of beasts were getting bigger and bigger. If they did plan to attack, then it was going to get harder to stop them.

"What‚Ä¶ are you looking for?" Jun finally asked as he ran in front of Quinn.

"Do you know what a nest crystal is?" Quinn replied back. "It's how beasts are created, by controlling the beasts, I am getting more information, and the more beasts in the area the closer we are to the nest crystal. You will see what I mean soon."

And soon, they saw exactly what Quinn meant. The location had taken them to a cave in a large hill of sorts, there were beasts outside, but they weren't as many as there usually would be in front of a nest crystal, or at least it didn't feel that way, because Quinn was controlling most of the beasts anyway.

On top of that, the few that were there, the shadow beasts he had created were dealing with them. All of them entered the cave, and they could see it, embedded almost as if it was on some type of stand was the Nest crystal.

'This has been quite the haul. I have managed to increase my forces, and at the same time, we can use the nest crystal on Russ to make him stronger.'

Quinn pulled it out from its place without much trouble and held it up. Even though they hadn't seen it before, just by its mystic look and energy radiating from it, they could tell it was something special.

"Wait!" Jun called out. "I can't let you just take that crystal."

"What are you saying?" Ceril said. "Just a moment ago, you knew nothing about this crystal, why can't we take it?"

There was a worried look on Jun's face. He knew these people's strength and what he was about to do was a big gamble.

"The crystals on this planet belong to the Penswi. Originally when I invited you guys to hunt, I thought you just wanted to practise or learn some skills. However, crystals obtained on the Penswi planet can't be taken by aliens.

"Although I can take the crystal and give it to you, there still needs to be a donation amount to the local government, and a crystal like this, that's so precious and hasn't been discovered before, I can imagine it could do great things for our planet. So I can't‚Ä¶.

"I can't just let you have this crystal."

Zallack was looking at Jun in a different light. Although he was part of the same pro team, Jun wasn't the most popular of the Dark reds. He was known as a trickster, and would at times use underhanded ways to win against his opponents.

But, he never thought that he cared so much for the planet.

Quinn was in a bit of a pickle, he didn't want to cause confrontation on the planet. Neither did he want to harm Jun who was helping them, he was a good person. If they went back though, then he would no doubt tell the others.

'I guess I have no choice. I'm not sure how well the influence skill will work on them, but I'm going to have to try to use it to remove his memories. It will be for the best.' Quinn said as his eyes started to glow red.

Due to the dark cave they were in, it was easier for all of them to see, and it was the first time Quinn was using a bit of his vampire aura.

Jun was covered in a sweat, as he held up his hand.

"Wait there is one way‚Ä¶ I am willing to keep this a secret, you can keep the crystal, but in return I have a favour. Join the Dark Red's and compete with us, on the planet tournament. With you, we can win." Jun smiled.
