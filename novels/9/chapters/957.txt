Chapter 958 - A speech

Seeing Peter stand there giving a fierce look at the crowd, the students were wondering just what feat or show he would put on for the rest of them and Quinn was as well.

’I guess he would show his impressive transformation ability and start selecting students from the crowds. Although then the other heads would know that was something he could do, but Nathan should know his ability already based on what happened last time.’ Quinn thought.

Nathan already knew of Peter’s ability to transform into others, because he had once been caught being disguised as a student that was supposedly dead but when that dead student was found to be very much alive, Peter had a difficult time after that.

However, what they had also witnessed was his incredible healing abilities. Which was why back then Nathan, Duke and Truedream thought they had witnessed a first of its kind. A human that could hold two abilities or more.

For they had even given Peter the Earth ability book to learn and had seen him display some of those skills as well.

There were many theories of how this was possible, perhaps Pure had successfully created a unique body, Peter could have had a unique body himself or it could have been an ability like that of Vorden at the time.

’We may never find out now.’ Nathan thought. "You have reached a position far too high, whereas previously you could have been forced to share your secrets, and your Faction sent a clear message yesterday, including you. You are ready to fight back at any time.’

Finally, Peter seemed to be doing something as he held one of his hands up in the air, and soon he grabbed it with the other. Within seconds, a cracking sound was heard, and his arm had gone limp, flopping about.

His facial expression never changed, even though he was now standing there with a broken arm, one he had broken himself.

Some of the students couldn’t look at the flapping arm any more, imagining the pain it had to have caused and were forced to look away.

"Does this guy feel no pain? I mean could you break your own arm like that?"

"He’s crazy, can’t you see it in his eyes!? I knew something like this was going to happen when he stepped on the stage."

In mere seconds though, the arm started to heal in front of everyone and was good as new. They had just witnessed a healing speed that seemed impossible in front of their very eyes.

"Now, for my next display." Peter said, positioning his hand into the form of a karate chop.

’Is he going to cut off his hand?’ Quinn thought, as he imagined the horror. "Peter stop." Quinn shouted. It was heard from those on the stage. But it was too far for any of the students to hear.

Not performing his second half of the trick, Peter started to walk off the stage and a round of applause slowly started.

Through his strange actions he had won the students over and they were quite impressed.

Sach, one of the Head Generals of Earthborn, looked at his fingers for a few seconds, and could remember the tight grip around them. ’He doesn’t just have super healing abilities, was he wearing beast gear underneath his clothes?’

Although that night, it didn’t look like anyone was wearing any beast gear, in his head it was the only thing that made sense.

Finally, the last announcement was ready to be made, and Quinn knew it was his turn to do something. He was hoping for some inspiration from Peter’s act, but that didn’t inspire him at all.

"Please welcome your Head General of the second group. Hardy Flynch!" The announcer said.

Hearing this name, the students tossed and turned their heads, to see if anyone in the crowd knew who they were. Although Peter hardly had any fame, there were a few that had seen him in the inter-base military tournament. Everyone they had seen so far at least one person had heard of their name, but for this person, it wasn’t the case at all.

They thought maybe when they saw him, but when they saw him walk onto the stage, they were even more dumbfounded about who this person was.

While the students seemed to not care for who this person was, they started talking amongst each other. It was the last thing before the ceremony was to end, and they were excited to see their rooms and more, and since the last person didn’t seem to be anyone of great importance the chatting had started.

However, the generals and sergeants that were all on stage were keeping a very close eye on him. After seeing what this person could do. Even the Graylash family were concerned after all, any human could become a possible threat in the future.

’Show us what you’re going to do?’ Innu thought. ’Are you going to get them all to shut their mouths, to stop speaking like you did with us.’

Looking at the students, Quinn could see that not all of them were chatting with their new friends they had made. Not all of them looked confident, some seemed frightened, nervous of their new school and Quinn had even spotted Sil out there amongst them. These students reminded him of how he had felt.

Helen’s words played through his head. ’Think what you would have liked to have seen when you were younger.’ With that, a smile spread across his face and he knew what ’He’ would have wanted to see back then.

"School is a life changing place. At such a young age your actions now decide your future, but you are only young. How are you meant to know that now is the most crucial time of your lives, or how are you meant to know what you want to do when you are older? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

"Your goals, your friends and the people around you will change as you grow up. These are things that you can change and there might be some things you can’t change. However, when I was in your position, standing where you were today, I was a level one student who had no ability. And now I am where I am today.

"I hope you all can see that if someone like me can do it, then all of you can as well, and I will be here to make that possible."

As Quinn started to speak, the crowd got quiet listening to his words. His voice was being projected by special equipment so everyone out on the field could hear.

"A speech, a speech talking about how weak he was?" The students were disappointed to say the least.

"Does he not have any powers, or anything that he can show, is that why he wanted to talk about how weak he was."

"Maybe all the other generals showed him up so he felt like he couldn’t show his powers."

Of course Quinn could have displayed his powers, he could have even shown his Shadow powers and claimed he was a student of the Cursed leader, Quinn. However, Quinn wanted to show that people in high positions of power shouldn’t just have strong abilities.

He wanted to put hope in those that didn’t have a strong ability. Of course, after the students had been told all their lives that their abilities matter and the stronger ones were important it would be hard to change this mindset.

Quinn didn’t mind all the words that were being spoken about him, it was his goal to change their mind.

Soon though, the sound of loud clapping could be heard. Single claps coming from one person, and it was coming from the side.

"That was a great speech..Whooo! Go on, best performance yet I would say compared to all these guys that just wanted to show off. That’s a real teacher right there!" Peter shouted loud and clear to everyone.

Although Peter was doing this in support of Quinn, he also did it because he was genuinely touched by Quinn’s words. Back then, he too was frightened, nervous and felt like a path had already been predetermined for him, it felt like Quinn was speaking to him.

Soon after, Helen was seen clapping as well, and the students slowly began to clap, but it wasn’t an applaud but rather just out of habit.

’Quinn I wonder if you really can do what you say. It might be a lot harder than you think.’ Oscar thought looking at the students’ disgruntled faces.
