Chapter 1185 Speaking up

Amidst a large dark forest where the leaves were coloured purple and the night sky showed more than one moon, a lone silhouette could be seen fleeing for its life. The beast known as a Bloodsucker had no time to slow down and the quickest choice seemed to be to simply destroy everything in its way, leaving behind a path of destruction, hoping that it would hinder those who had come for it.

It wasn‚Äôt used to feeling like prey. Usually, it was the predator, hunting down any vampires that would leave the settlement to get their precious blood packs. Unfortunately, today it had chosen the wrong target.

When he had attacked the strange girl who had been on her own, she had retaliated and cut off one of its arms. A little blood pack should have been enough to regenerate it, but even after consuming the blood it carried with it, nothing had happened, informing the creature that something was very wrong.

‚ÄôI have to get away from this monster!‚Äô The Bloodsucker instinctively thought.

The Bloodsucker stopped for a brief moment, as it had no clue where it was. It just knew that it needed to return back to its own hideout where it had been gathering supplies. Alas, the forest was vast and easy to get lost in.

The only orientation on this planet were little landmarks, yet if there had been any other signs, it had destroyed it during its escape. Ready to move on, to hopefully find something, the beast felt chains wrapping around his legs. The next second it was yanked on causing it to fall to the floor.

Grabbing a tree nearby he thought perhaps he could use his superior strength to pull himself away, but instead his hands just ripped through the tree and his body continued to get pulled across the ground.

Doing whatever he could he soon pulled against the chain that was around his foot, his veins building around his singular bicep as he tried to use his mighty strength. The yanking stopped, making him believe that he was saved for a short moment, until he heard ruffling through the trees. It looked up to see that the chains led above, all the way to the girl with the scary looking yellow eyes.

They grew closer and closer until his vision faded... and he was no more. Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

Erin unraveled the chains from his foot and placed them around her forearms once more. She swung her sword, allowing the blood to fall to the ground, before she wiped off any that remained.

"You‚Äôre getting better at using the chains as a fighting tool." Leo commented, appearing close to her. They both looked at the Bloodsucker‚Äôs body as they needed to figure out what to do with it.

"Did you find his hideout?" Erin asked.

"Yes, but it worked alone. This Bloodsucker was constantly luring out vampires who would leave the settlement and stealing their blood packs and judging by the bones in its hideout, also killing some of them. You shouldn‚Äôt feel much guilt for killing one of its kind." Leo answered.

"The real question is, did killing it, help you sate some bloodlust?"

"To a degree. It feels less satisfying than killing a normal vampire. I can control myself even without the suppression chains, but they have proven useful for fighting and are a good tool to slow down the rising urge. Your method seems to be working. I think I‚Äôm able to control it bit by bit as you said." Erin told her teacher.

Having looked after Erin for a while now in the Vampire World, Leo had experienced a number of different things. First, they had traveled far out, to get away from the settlement. This was a large planet and while most of the vampires were concentrated in one place, there were others.

Many vampires had left the settlement, and some of them had turned into Bloodsuckers like this one who were roaming outside. The one thing they craved was human blood, but since there weren‚Äôt any humans on the planet itself, they couldn‚Äôt stray too far away from the settlement.

Leo‚Äôs plan had been to lengthen the time between each kill to satisfy her urge, waiting until the Dhampir couldn‚Äôt take it any more. The problem Erin had suffered was due to her having suppressed the urge for the longest time, meaning it had come too sudden, and too strong.

Previously, Erin didn‚Äôt even have time to get used to the feeling and the suppression chains could only postpone the issue, not remove it. Which was why Leo had opted for this method, and from the looks of it, it was working. Fortunately, with Erin being the way she was, and by using Leo‚Äôs ability, it was easy enough for the duo to track down stray vampires and Bloodsuckers.

As a side-effect, Erin seemed to be growing in strength after each fight. These Bloodsuckers, or vampires that had escaped from the settlement could only do so if they had a certain amount of strength. Being able to survive this long they were quite powerful.

At first, Leo had stayed by his protegee‚Äôs side, aiding her, but eventually her power had grown enough that she could take care of one on her own. Erin had been evolving in front of his eyes. Before it would have worried the Blind Swordsman, but since it looked like she would be able to control herself one day, it settled his mind.

"How much longer will we have to stay here?" Erin asked.

"We are in no rush. I know you want to go back to see our friends, but given your circumstance we should stay patient and make sure you really have your condition under control. If there is something they can‚Äôt handle on their own, I‚Äôm sure Quinn would have called for us." Leo looked back through the forests and although he was unable to see it, he was looking straight at the direction of the vampire settlement.

On the top floor of the tenth castle, Paul was filling out some paperwork. The whole castle and its men had gone through the daily tasks so many times that they were working like clockwork, leaving the Vampire Knight with little to do. Thanks to the help of Timmy, Xander and also Ashley, who had volunteered to take off some of his burdens there was even less.

‚ÄôIf only the human race could be as peaceful as this one day.‚Äô Paul thought to himself. The next second his daydream was interrupted by the sounds of someone knocking at his office‚Äôs door.

"Knight Paul, you have a visitor." Timmy spoke after entering. He had quite the worried look on his face, which could only mean that it was someone of importance. For a moment Paul thought about whether he should entertain the guest in the throne room, but that didn‚Äôt seem proper since Quinn was still the Cursed family‚Äôs leader, even if most of the tasks were being handled by the Vampire Knight.

After hearing who it was, Paul wasn‚Äôt too worried and instructed them to be brought to his office. A few moments later Kazz was escorted inside.

"It‚Äôs nice to meet you again after all this time." Paul greeted her standing up, offering her a seat opposite his desk. She accepted the seat and sat down. "I‚Äôm sure your unannounced visit isn‚Äôt just to reminisce about the time when the two of us were in the Cursed faction together. Isn‚Äôt it against vampire etiquette for knights to meet outside formal meetings? So what brought you here today?"

"I‚Äôm the leader of the first family now." Kazz quickly corrected him. It was meant to be a temporary measure since Bryce was elected King. Usually knights weren‚Äôt allowed to become leaders but there was no one more appropriate at the moment. Besides, the King‚Äôs castle was busy, so a new first leader had yet to be selected which was why Kazz continued to do this job for the time being.

"Then, doesn‚Äôt that mean I have even more reason to worry why you are here?" Paul smiled. "So why are you coming to me out of the blue so suddenly."

For a moment, Kazz remained silent as she wondered what to tell him. ‚ÄôWould it even change anything if I informed the tenth castle about what my father is doing? Why exactly did I come here?‚Äô

Paul could see that whatever matter it was, Kazz seemed to be struggling to tell him, so he remained silent, pouring her a cup of tea, waiting for her to come to a decision.
