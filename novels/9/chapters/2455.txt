Looking around, all that could be seen was a thick mist. It was grey in colour and as Quinn wiped his hand through it, none of it moved. He was unable to see further than just his body ahead; it was so thick. 

'Where is this place?' Quinn thought. 'Did Immortui put me here after defeating me? But that doesn't make any sense, wouldn't he want to keep a close eye on me, to make sure I can't escape.'

Quinn's mind was relatively sound, he could remember everything that had occured beforehand. He remembered how he had lost the battle against Immortui, and the red energy pouring into him. 

For him, it was an expected result. Which was why he had come up with a plan with the others, and that's why he was even more confused about where he currently was. 

Looking at his hands, he could see that his self wasn't completely solid, his own body was slightly transparent.  Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

'If I didn't know any better I would have thought that I was a ghost, but why can I still access my system?' 

The system screen popped up just fine, but there were certain things that didn't work. For one, he was unable to use his shadow ability. At the same time, he couldn't use his blood aura either. 

He tried, even using the system to activate his skills, but nothing was working. When using the inspect skill on the fog, only question marks would appear as well.

"Alright, I need to try something, Hello!" Quinn shouted out loud, wondering if he would get a response back, but there was nothing. 

Part of him thought it might have been a special celestial space, something that was created by Immortui, but even then, he should have been able to use his powers. 

In the end, Quinn did what he only could do, and that was run, he ran through the mist, left, right, straight ahead, seeing if he would come across anything. It felt unusual as if his body wasn't moving at all. 

After running for a while, Quinn eventually gave up, noticing that clearly it was doing nothing.

'How do I get out of here!'

Was this the torture that Immortui spoke of, an endless loop in a closed space? No, there had to be more to it. Quinn continued to run around, he jumped and struck the air, but there was nothing. 

"Is anyone there!" Quinn shouted. "Immortui! What have you done to me!"

In a way, Quinn did feel like this was torture. He was already imagining that the passage of time in here was far faster than that on the outside. Maybe he had been in here five minutes, but it had been years on the outside. 

He was starting to think the worst was happening to his family, that was until he heard someone. 

"Quinn… is that you?" A voice whispered in the mist.

——

Outside, the others were looking at Quinn's body. Still held up in the cave on the mountain. There was no reaction from his body. No movement since they had brought him here, just the sound of his breath and heartbeat, letting them know that he was still alive. 

"I really wonder, what is happening to him?" Peter said, sitting back down by the body's side, staying on guard. 

Everyone now knew each other's backgrounds well. Edvard and Chris were still outside scouting the planet and had yet to come back. 

"So, are we just going to stay here?" Russ asked. "Or are we going to do something?" 

Calva had gone out, to the edge of the cave, he looked out far and wide, at the surroundings, the trees, and more, eventually coming back to the others. 

"I have some good news, and some bad news for you all." Calva said. "As I said before, I believe the best thing we can do right now is free the Champions, they will be able to help us. With all of our strength, I believe that we can take out the demon kings and obtain their blood as needed one by one, before they can inform Immortui of where we are… it's the only way really. With me, I can convince them to help us."

"We have met one of the champions and know their strength." Hikel replied. "So, I don't think it's a bad idea, and if you say you can convince them that's good, but what was the bad news you speak of?" 

Calva pointed outside the cave. 

"The planet we are on now is known as the planet of the Giants. It's where the strong Yak demon race belongs. On this planet, there is a Champion, but there is also the demon king of the powerful Yaks.

"The champion's name is Pultra. She is locked up, in a garden, with the Yak's overlooking her. Out of the two Champions, she might be the most difficult to get to, since she is being watched."

The group were thinking for a while, since they were on the planet anyway, they might as well attempt to rescue the champion, but one word from any of the demon kings and Immortui would be right where they were, and Quinn didn't look like he was going to get out of his condition any time soon. 

"Do you know where she is locked up?" Sil asked. "If you do, then I can use my powers to teleport us there. You can talk to her, and we can bring her back out. I could even create a clone to transform to look like her, that way the demons won't get suspicious of her." 

Calva's eyes widened. This one person could do so many things, create clones, transform, and even teleport. It was a blessing to have him, and perhaps the person that they needed to help them.

"I know what planet you and Hikel were on as well, we can do the same. I can take Calva and use him to convince this Shinto to come to our side first, but I think we should try this Pultra person first."

The others felt a bit guilty, Sil had already done so much, and now what were they supposed to do. Just sit there and wait, just wait until they could actually be of use?

"We will need all of us in this." Sil replied. "If there are those that are strong enough to do that to Quinn, then it means just me won't be enough. 

"Honestly, even if we are to rescue these champions, when it comes to taking on the demon kings, I think it will be impossible to fight them without Immortui noticing something." Sil stated. 

No one wanted to say anything, but the big part of this plan required Immortui not knowing and it just felt impossible. 

"You guys will need to take out the demon kings. After rescuing the champions, when the fighting starts, if Immortui finds out what we're doing, or comes after us, then I will do everything in my power to fight him, and stall for time. 

"I will hold back Immortui while trusting you guys."
