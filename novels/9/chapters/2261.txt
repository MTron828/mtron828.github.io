It was the grand conquest of the Marpo Cruise with the leaders Jack and Jim. So far they had been taking it in turns as to which one was the main attacker when it came to attacking different races.

They never had much trouble doing things this way. There were times where the opponent was a little tough, but they always had forces that were bigger and stronger than the other. Yet for the first time, both were having major trouble.

Jack had yet to receive any updates from Jim about what was happening, and even if a request for help was sent out, there was no way for him to really help the other in the first place.

That was because Jack had a lot of trouble himself. The androids had destroyed many parts of the Marpo Cruise. The strong Dalki were struggling against their opponent and in the end, he had to use his trump card, H and the six spiked Dalki, but he had confidence in them that they would be able to get the job done, even if Pine couldn't.

The Dalki known as H, and the two six spiked Dalki had landed in the market square. The fighting had virtually stopped all around, but those that were fighting the five spikes just moments ago were still close by at the edge of the market.

Nearly all of them knew of the being called H. Russ and Layla had seen the visualisation of the battle against Sil. Logan, Vicky, and Jake had heard and seen him act a few times here and there so they had plenty of information on him.

As for the Blades, Shiro, and the others, they were there during the battle as well. Seeing H standing there, caused all of them to freeze. It had already taken a lot out of them all, nearly all of them had pushed themselves to the limit just to defeat the five Spikes as well as Pine, and now they had H.

However, what were they to do? If they tried to run away, there was nowhere to go, and surely he could catch them all, other than Stark who wasn't there. Could they try to talk and beg for their life?

That would have been foolish, this was war and they had already killed Pine. All of this meant, they only had one choice, they had to fight knowing full well that there was a high chance of dying, no, that they would die.

Which was why Wince had made the first move, she had ultimately realised this before everyone else, and if she could get a hit in, to damage H in any way possible, then maybe it would give them a chance to survive, or maybe at least the others.

However, the results were devastating, the trident used in the attack had been grabbed and was hurled right back at Wince, creating a large hole in her stomach. Ceril, her dear sister by her side, could see no life in her eyes.

"No, no, what are the Mermerials meant to do now? What are they meant to do without you? Who is meant to lead them, me? That won't work, that can't work, you can't be dead!" Ceril cried.

"Don't worry, you can join her." H said. One moment he was in the centre of the marketplace, the next as if he had teleported and he was right next to Ceril, with his hand raised above her head.

Only, H's hand didn't look regular. It had a sharp edge, his entire hand looked like a giant sword, and that was because he was using the transformation ability. The transformed hand, although looking like a sword, had the Dalki outer skin and hard scales.

Swinging it down, Ceril could see the attack, with her half vampire self, she tried to move out of the way, using the blood water to push her, the power of her own leg's but it was far too slow.

The bladed Dalki hand went right through the centre of her body, and the two half split apart. Right in front of their eyes they had all witnessed it, another one of the pillars of the group had been eliminated in front of their eyes and with such ease as well.

"We‚Ä¶ can't beat him." Shiro said.

"He's stronger than last time." Vorden added speaking in the mind. "He has more spikes than before‚Ä¶ he has ten spikes on his back."

From the tail running up, there were spikes all along, then on H's shoulder, two spikes could be seen sticking out, even larger than that of the ones running on his back. Never had they ever witnessed a ten spike Dalki before.

When they met him on the ship, they hadn't seen his back apart from when he was chasing Stark, and he had done so too fast in the first place, now they could count the number of spikes easily.

The problem was, not only would going up against a ten spike be difficult in the first place for all of them, or near enough impossible, this was not an ordinary ten spike. This was infused with parts of the Blade family, and had remnants of Hilston's DNA.

One of the most fierce and cruel Blades to ever live. Then he also had multiple abilities running through his body. All of these things were stacking up. Even if they hadn't gone against Pine and the five spikes from before, they felt like they would have stood no chance.

"We were idiots." Shiro clenched his fist. "To think that we could rescue Sil from them. We trained so hard, thinking that all that hard work would have enabled us to do something, but we would have never been able to rescue Sil."

"What are you talking about!" Vorden shouted in Shiro's head.

"We did rescue Sil, and we were all there! So the hard work was not in vain."

"Does any of that really matter?" Raten said. "At the end of the day, no matter what we cry about, we need to fight this bastard, and somehow live."

In other areas in the marketplace, there were those that were contemplating what to do.

"We have to get out of here, if they found out we helped Logan we could be done for as well!" The humans shouted, already running away.

"I think that's our cue to get out of here as well." Vicky said, putting Logan on her shoulder.

"What are you doing?" Logan said. "Didn't you want to take revenge? That person is made up of your family. When we found out, you said you would do everything in your power to take him out."

"They are already dead." Vicky replied. "But you Logan, you are still alive. Right now, I care about those that are still alive a lot more than the dead. I already nearly lost you, I'm not going to lose you!"

"Then what about Jake?" Logan replied. "He is still down there, and it looks like he's ready to fight." V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

Meanwhile, there was one more group of people, arguing with each other.

"We have to go!" Russ stated. "We can't face that person. I was in charge of protecting you and your family, so I'm telling you now we have to leave."

"If we leave now, then that means everyone on this planet dies. Everything will have been lost!" Layla argued back.

"And how are we going to beat a guy like that in the first place!" Russ shouted back.

"You beat Pine didn't you, You were strong enough to beat him, so you can do the same again."

"I can't!" Russ replied. "I have already used up nearly all of my powers. Let's just get out of here! Minny, you want to protect your mum and uncle right, then shadow us away, or shadow us to Quinn or something, you can do that right?"

In the middle of their arguing, H had returned to the centre of the Marketplace. He placed both of his hands together, and his fingertips started to cover in frost. In the centre of his hand a large ice ball was being made.

"Let's get rid of everyone in one go." H declared.

Even the two six spike's next to H didn't like the sound of that.
