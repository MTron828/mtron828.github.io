Chapter 986 - Noob fighter vs God fighter

After accepting the request, Quinn was transported to the area where the two of them would be fighting. Stood opposite him was a man who had no top on, having his full chiselled six-pack out on display. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The man had what looked like a piece of red string around his arm and wore nothing but a pair of green shorts. The man wasn’t even wearing any shoes and walked barefoot.

’I know this isn’t the real world, but we still have a sense of feeling here.’ Quinn thought.

It was true that the VR made one feel as if they were really there and they even felt slight pain. Although the pain sensor was set at an extremely low value and the pain felt was nothing like one would experience in real life. Instead, the computer would sometimes have to just guess how one’s body would react when taking a hit.

Quinn also noticed that the stages for spectating that would often be empty were now full of spectators, something that hadn’t happened until this fight.

’I haven’t seen this many people since I was the Bloodevolver.’ Quinn thought, looking around.

There were many people who would often watch those that were top-ranked. People liked watching battles between two strong opponents, that’s just how it was, but in particular, more people seemed interested than usual.

The Martial art god gave a wave to the crowd of people. They all cheered in response as if it was something that he had done a thousand times. It was routine for him.

’Even if that Noob fighter was able to surprise me and got the upper hand, he won’t be able to deal with the Gatekeeper.’ Chun said as he watched from the sidelines.

This was another name that was given to the martial art god. The reason why he was called the Gatekeeper was due to his rank, being placed at fifty. All those above the rank of fifty constantly faced each other and the ranking remained unchanged for a long time.

Where as many would fall when meeting with the Gatekeeper, staying above rank fifty.

"It’s been a while since I have seen a new person enter the hundred rankings, so I thought it was best to introduce myself to you first. See if you are worthy." The martial art god said.

’Is this guy role playing? I mean, I can’t really make fun of him. I used to do the same thing when I was younger, except I had no friends to Roleplay with.’ Quinn thought.

’And that is why the internet is a great thing, bringing all these strangers together who have similar interests. There is no need for others to judge you.’ Vincent replied.

Towards the upper top ranks, closer to a hundred, they would change quite often with people coming in and out, but the martial art god had already faced them all, which was why when he saw someone new, he was quite interested in this said person.

Before the fight began, Quinn checked two things, that his limiter was now set at fifty again, which was all good, and as for the second thing. He bowed down, out of respect.

"If you are truly a martial art god like your name suggests, then it will be an honour to learn from you." Quinn replied, getting a little bit into the role-playing himself.

"It looks like at least this one knows how to show respect." The martial art god said, as he raised one of his knees and then slammed his foot on the ground.

He had simply gotten in a fighting stance, but even Quinn could tell something was different. For his last fight, he thought he might be able to take it easy, but it didn’t look like he could do that at all.

The fight had begun, but the martial art god stayed in the same position, with his left leg slightly in front and both arms raised by his face.

’Is this Muay Thai?’ Vincent said. Although Vincent wasn’t much of a fighter, he did know a few things about fighting. During his greater years when he was younger, this fighting style was quite popular among young ones.

Since it didn’t look like the martial art god was going to attack first, Quinn was going to be the one to instigate the fight.

’I’ll figure out what his ability is first, and then flash step out of the way and reposition myself when I get the chance.’ Quinn thought.

When Quinn was finally in range of the martial arts god, everyone thought the fight would be over in that second, just like all the others.

Suddenly, Quinn felt a throbbing pain in his t.h.i.g.h, making him stop in his tracks and soon, he fell to his knees.

’What happened, my leg? I didn’t see him.’ But Quinn saw the next one coming towards him. A lightning-fast kick that had hit his t.h.i.g.h was now coming at his head. Seeing how the kick had affected his t.h.i.g.h like so, he thought lifting his arm to block the attack would do nothing.

He would still lose the fight, and even if his body was great at recovering, his legs weren’t good enough yet to use the flash step, so he did the only thing he could.

"A mistake, my legs have been conditioned to take out tree trunks, and you think your fist is going to stop my legs!" Martial arts god shouted.

However, Quinn’s fist was no ordinary fist. How many times had he punched until his fist broke, how many times had he broken his arms from fighting to the death? His body wasn’t human, and his bones had significantly strengthened.

When the two collided, surprisingly to him and the others, the martial art god’s t.h.i.g.h kick had been stopped. By now, Quinn had recovered and used his flash step to get behind his opponent and was ready. Learning his lesson from last time, Quinn attempted a kick instead of a punch, not wanting to get too close. Still, suddenly, a pivot from the martial arts god, and he was facing him once again.

He had ducked under Quinn’s fast moving leg and then grabbed the back of his neck with both of his arms locking him in. Pulling his head down, Quinn’s face was met with a knee, but it didn’t stop there. The knees continued one after another.

Quinn tried his best to pull away, but the man had him locked in, and when he finally let go, Quinn’s force of pulling away swung his head back and caused him to stumble, while the martial arts god spun around and hit the side of his head with an elbow.

[Winner ’Martial arts god.’]

[You are no longer ranked]

As quick as Quinn had entered the rankings, he had left them too. Although Quinn wasn’t helpless, the fight was clearly one sided.

The people who had watched the match were a little disappointed. Those that failed to reach the rankings, and even those that had wished to see someone for the first time, surpass and went through to the upper ranks, but it looked like this person would not be the one.

’What did you guys expect?’ Chun thought. ’One was called Noob fighter, and the other martial arts god. I’m just glad that the guy that beat me got beat, and Martial art’s god didn’t even move from his position.’

After the fight, Quinn was back in the white room. Rather than upset by his loss, instead, he was pleased. Finally, he had found what he was looking for. A person who excelled at fighting that could teach him.

’Now, how do I convince him to teach me?’ Quinn thought.

Just then, he had received a party invite. This was where people could enter the same white room together and use it as a training room, or one could search matches while others watched.

However, the invite was from the martial god himself.

’Looks like I might not have to contact him first after all.’

Accepting the invite, the man in the green shorts appeared in front of him and turned to look at Quinn.

"I wanted to ask you a question, during our fight, why didn’t you use your ability against me? Did you think you could win without it?"

"That’s how I fight, is there a problem? I don’t believe you used an ability either?" Quinn asked.

"Yes, there is a problem. Fight me again, and use everything you have this time." The man said.

"Wai-"

"Fight me!"

"Just istn-"

"Fight me!"

Quinn was a little frustrated with how this man was acting. He wouldn’t let him get a word in.

’Should I just beat him and then ask him to teach me? Maybe he will respect me this way?’ Quinn thought as he was getting ready to turn the limiter off.

’No, I have a better idea.’
