2513 ¬†The messenger steps in

Usually, in the case of the Black Swordsman's power, whenever he used it would negate their ability. In terms of energy, it stopped things as well, but there were some instances where things could still work.

The Black Swordsman's own body was quite unique, after all. In fact, he could still draw out his own powers even when using the sword. His body was unaffected by his own powers, which was how Russ was able to use his powers, to summon himself as the Black Swordsman and continue to use his powers.

With a special sword that drew out one's power, would it be the same?

Rushing forward, Russ, with the two swords, thrust them. Both of the swords started to cover themselves in the black aura, and it seemed like his power was staying. Now it was almost like he had two of the same weapons in his hands.

As it stabbed into the centre of Luce's stomach, he felt it twist and turn inwards until the swords had pierced the inside of his body.

Luce couldn't believe it; he had one of his arms above, stopping the celestial energy. He had been hit multiple times as well by Peter, and now an attack had finally gotten through and had managed to pierce his skin.

The swords hadn't just pierced his skin like last time, but had gone completely through his body.

"What is this? Was I weakened by all this celestial energy? It was from that strange person's punches, and from above. Not even my own power knows what to do. Fighting all three of them at once is too hard!"

This was a thought Luce had never had before. He was a Demon King, one of the strongest in the Red space, and one that was raised by Immortui to take out all of the Celestials.

Now that he had just come across one of them, he was already losing this fight. And these strangers, who were they? Who were they to push him as far back as this? They weren't even Celestials.

"Hey, I think you're a bit messed up now; it looks like you've lost this fight," Russ said, as he twisted the sword further.

The attack and celestial energy from the top had stopped as Mundus went back on the ground again. Seeing this, Luce went and held onto the swords, and he tried pushing back.

"What do you mean? Just because you injured me once you think this fight is over?" Luce stated.

"That's exactly what I mean!" The aura and black-coloured power from the swordsman started to erupt into the two swords, and slowly Luce's body was starting to change.

His strong white power, which gave him a coating on top of his skin, started to fade away. It was slowly revealing his natural skin from before. All of his power; it was disappearing.

"The power is part of your body, right? So I just needed to insert my power inside you, and it looks like it's done the trick," Russ stated. Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

Perhaps if he didn't have both swords, it wouldn't have been enough power, nor would the strike have been strong enough to pierce through Luce's body, so he was thankful for this.

With the intervention of Mundus and his weapon, the fight had drastically changed, and if it wasn't for that, then all three of them would have been killed.

"Peter, I'll let you do the honors!" Russ said, as he held onto the swords firmly, not taking them out of the body. If he did, then his powers would come back.

Immediately, teleporting slightly above with the Boneclaw was Peter, who had been dropped. His two head tails had combined into one, forming a type of giant axe behind him.

"All of the power I've gained, all of the strength from the changes in my body, all of my Qi, and all of the celestial energy that Quinn gave me. I'll finish it off right here with you!" Peter screamed inside of his head as his head tail went down.

It sliced down the centre of Luce, going through and in between the two swords in Luce's body. When it hit the ground, the whole area was shaking along with the rubble, and Peter had also fallen to the ground, collapsing.

He had put all of his strength into the attack, so much so that he had even forgotten about standing back up; he was just using the whole momentum of his body with everything he had. He had face-planted the ground.

When he looked up, though, he could see the two swords had been taken out, and Luce's body had split apart and fallen flat on the ground.

"It's over!" Hikel's mouth was left wide open as he rushed over to the others, his arms still no longer there. He had tripped, more exhausted than he had realized but came right over to see the two of them there.

Russ' body was already reverting back to normal. Perhaps he could have only kept up the Black Swordsman's form for a few seconds more, if that.

For the group, rarely did they fight together; they had always fought tough battles on their own and overcame whatever they faced. But it took everything all of them had, radical changes to their body, every ounce of power in their bones, and they had finally done it. They had defeated the Demon King. It was now one less problem for them to deal with.

The sound of footsteps was heard coming from their side, though, and when they looked at the creature in front of them, one that didn't quite look human, they realized that their problems perhaps weren't over.

"I think you have something in your hands that belongs to me," Mundus said while his hand was held out. "While I'm at it, you can hand me the black sword as well. It's a bit too dangerous to be in the hands of others."

Russ looked up at the man; he didn't want to hand over any of the weapons, but his condition and Mundus were in two different states. A fight against him would be impossible and would just bring them all to his death.

A weapon wasn't worth fighting over.

"You don't need to hand me over the black sword now," Mundus said. "It will disrupt my powers, but I am just informing you that I will be back for it."

A large surge of energy was felt shifting through them all; the red mist was vibrating, and it was all moving away from where they were. The Red space, it was clearing up as all of the energy was moving away.

They looked in the direction of where the power was coming from. "It's Quinn and Immortui; the two of them, they must be fighting."

Peter immediately got up and went to run forward, but Mundus pushed him back down with his hand on his chest, sending him back to the floor.

"What are you doing? I thought you were here to help Quinn!" Peter shouted.

"Did I say that?" Mundus asked.
