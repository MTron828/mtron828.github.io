The ultimate team had been formed and they were going after Quinn, but they weren't going in with the intention of saving him, instead this team was going in with the intention of supporting him. 

A task that might cause Quinn to risk too much, or for him to not come back, either way, whatever it was that he made need, they would be there to help him. The team consisted of long time friend Peter. 

The two had met at the academy, and had been friends from the beginning, but their true bond formed after Peter had risked his life to save Quinn and ended up becoming one of the first turns by Quinn. Ever since, he had been loyal. 

Now, with the help of the four Kings of the familiars' world as well as his celestial form and his Wight powers, he was ready to face what was ahead. On top of that, there was Sil who Quinn had met at the academy; his powers needed no introduction as to why he was selected to come aboard. 

Chris and Russ, although not the closest to Quinn and had met him through strange ways, both had strong powers. One physical as well as a set of unique traits due to being a werewolf while the other hugely diverse and with the power of the black sword as well as a god slayer item, he was stronger than he was before. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lastly, there were the two vampire originals, Edvard and Hikel. Although the originals no longer had power comparable to the others, for Edvard he had been gifted the special red dragon armour. One belonging to one of the strangest beings in existence, as for Hikel. 

Having gone through an experiment of Vincent's, he had achieved great changes in his body that put him beyond the rest. 

All of these people were strong, but they were heading possibly to the most dangerous place in existence. Using the power of the Boneclaw, they had no idea where they would end up, but were ready to battle as soon as they went through to the other side. 

A portal had opened up. In a dark space, there was little light around the room, apart from a few glowing touches that were on the side of the walls in the distance. 

Right out of the portal, zapping out at the same time, were all six of the group. It had nearly shot them out, as all of them tumbled to the ground. Some falling on top of each other. 

The portal flickered for a few moments, before disappearing.

"Get off me!" Peter shouted, as he shoved Chris' large body from him. A few of the others were untangling themsleves as well. 

"I guess the Boneclaw really did use up the last of his energy to bring us here in the end." Edvard said, brushing off some of the dirt on his red armour. He had come in wearing the red armour in case they needed to fight from the get go. 

"Alright, the good news is, it seems that everyone has made it to the other side all okay." Hikel commented.

"You mean bad news." Peter commented looking Russ' way. 

Hikel already felt this was a going to be a headache, although this might have been the ultimate team in terms of power, it certainly wasn't when it came to teamwork. Thankfully he did have a little bit of experience with this due to the vampire originals being the same way.

"So, the big question would be, where are we right now? I thought we would have at least been able to see the sky, or maybe dreaded monsters would be all over us, or the world ending due to Quinn's and Immortui's fight." Edvard commented.

Each of them looked around the room, and it was clear they were somewhere dark. It felt like they were in an underground cellar as the whole area was covered in brick, but what was even more surprising was that there were other living things in the room, a lot of them. 

With their advanced eyesight in the dark, they could see what these beings that were down with them looked like. They had a human shape, a head, arms and legs and the same amount as well. 

Although with a squint, they noticed that they had three fingers, and their heads didn't exactly look normal either. Where their eyes were there were things slightly like an elephant trunk on two sides. I think you should take a look at

For both Chris, and Peter this was a trip down memeory lane. 

"That… it's the same thing that attacked us on that Graylash planet, that celestial, right?" Chris said. 

That thing wasn't the right word to use, since there were perhaps fifty of them in the room that they could see all with the same features, just different shapes and sizes. At the time, the celestials had tried to get rid of the high number of god slayers that were coming from earth, and Mundus had sent a fighter celestial that had come from this world, which is why Peter and Chris felt like they had seen this person before. 

"Well, if they are all as strong as the last guy, then we're in big trouble." Chris said.

"Alright, so what do we do, do we try break out of here, use Sil's powers to teleport us to the land and start searching for Quinn, or what?" Russ asked.

"I think we should try and figure out where we are first, maybe we should talk to these guys that are down here." Hikel suggested, although thier was something off about the others. 

They had practically arrived through a teleporter, and looked nothing like the local inhabitants. At a guess they had to be beings of intelligence yet they weren't batting an eye at the strange visitors that had entered. 

Hearing Hikel's suggestion, surprisingly Peter was the one who acted first, and started to head towards one of the inhabitants. They were up against the wall on thier own, minding thier own business. 

Peter bent his knees, trying to get eye level with the perosn.

"Hey, tell us what is this place, where are we, do you know a man named Quinn, or where that bastard Immortui is, and if you don't feel like answering us, I'll punch you in the face, but if you do then you can keep your face." Peter said making a fist. 

"Ah yes, let's send out our best communicator." Russ smiled. "Surely with those elegant and kind words, the stranger will be inclined to answer us." 

The person looked up at Peter, and just let out a chuckle. The others flinched a little worried for what Peter might do based on this reaction but they soon started speaking. 

"This place… is hell, killing me would be doing me a favour." The person answered. 

Just what kind of place had they been transported to?
