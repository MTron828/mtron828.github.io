Chapter 1277 - Ray Of Hope

Layla was left standing there not really knowing what to do as strange things were happening around Quinn. One moment she saw the amulet light up around his neck and the next second the tree started to grow in size, without him explaining anything to her.

However, judging by his reaction it was only because Quinn was just as surprised by the consequences of his actions as she was. The next moment, Quinn seemed to be concentrating extremely hard.

"Don't worry about Quinn. He's just playing with the tree for a little bit and should probably be back soon." Vincent turned around, informind Layla: It had become a natural thing for the two of them to switch whenever Quinn would use his Full Control.

'There he is again, the same person as last time. I can tell that's not Quinn, but then just who is it? I doubt Shiro planted someone else inside Quinn's mind, so does that mean there has always been someone else inside his body?' That thought saddened Layla, not because it would mean that Quinn was in a situation similar to that of Vorden, Raten and Sil, but the fact that he had decided to keep it a secret even from her. Even though she couldn't have helped him in any way with it, it would have been nice if he could have confided in her.

Layla was about to ask that mysterious person who he was, but then the real Quinn appeared in front of her asking to borrow the sword once again.. Not having any reason to refuse him, she handed it over and without explaining anything he started to walk towards the tablet.

'Quinn, why do so many strange things happen around you? There're many people who believe the world revolves around them, that only their life is important, but when I watch you‚Ä¶ it's as if I realise how unimportant my own life is in comparison. At the moment, the whole world really does seem to be revolving around you.' Layla thought, as she rubbed her elbow up and down with her hand.

A few moments later, the watch around her wrist started to vibrate, indicating that there was an incoming call.

"Hey Layla, thank God, you answered." Sam said from the other side. It was clear he was worried about something, making Layla think that the attack might have started, which would probably be the worst timing with Quinn out of it once more.

"Are the two of you okay, have you been attacked as well?" Sam asked.

"Huh? No, we're both fine, we're just by the tablet at the moment. What's going on, who was attacked and by whom?"

"It's the Blades. They came back to report that while they had been underground they had been attacked by some roots. I tried to get in contact with the others, but fortunately they seem to be the only ones who have been attacked so far."

When hearing the words roots, straight away Layla's mind went to the giant tree in the middle. The timing of the attack, and when Quinn was messing around with the tree seemed to be quite similar.

"Are they okay now, they're not being attacked anymore, are they?" Layla asked.

"No, but they have decided to move away from the underground cells and into the castle. So their session has been delayed a little." Sam explained.

"I think it might have something to do with Quinn.' Layal saad thinking back to the time before the tablet. "There should be no need to panic, but I'll ask him once he's done." Layla said, hanging up the call there.

Layla's answer had only added to his confusion.

'When he's done? When he's done with what exactly?'

‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîGeett the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Listening to the voice in the tablet speak, Quinn was sure of it. It had just claimed that its name used to be Ray Talen, the same family name that Quinn currently had himself. Now, the Quest was starting to make sense, but the only thing was, nothing else was making sense to him.

"Ray Talen‚Ä¶ so that means we're related, right? But how? I thought you were some sort of God that gave all the world their abilities? How is that possible? Is my father a God? Does that make me a god as well? But I'm a vampire!" Quinn's reaction to this sudden information was to blurt out a bunch of questions.

In all honesty, he had been through some pretty crazy things before as he learned about his vampire side of his family, learned about Eno's past, learned about Arthur and Vincent, but this information was one thing that made no sense in his head at all. In the first place, his family carried the Talen name which had come from his father.

Not the Eno family name, which most likely meant that Quinn's vampire side had come from his mother, but he had no clue that his non-vampire side would also be so special.

"Calm down, boy. Has it been so long that you've forgotten what I said to you last time?" Ray questioned him. "I was a being that was even more powerful than the Gods. Still, the fact remains, that before I reached that point, I did live my life as a human."

"My parents, although I carried their blood, my own existence and powers continued inside of me, my body changed and I eventually passed that on. It must have eventually reached you. When I asked your name last time, I realised that this had to be the most likely reason as for why the two of us are able to talk."

"Please take note that we are talking about a few 1000 years between my generation and yours, so don't ask me if I know your mother or father, I can already predict your next question."

If Quinn and Ray really were related in some way, then it would make sense why his family also had no clue about this. His mother or their mothers for so much time had passed. Still there was one thing that was on Quinn's mind. If this person wasn't a god, then what was he?

"What‚Ä¶ exactly were you? It's already hard for me to even imagine how great a God would be, but then what is greater than that?" Quinn asked.

"I was once feared all over the land. Humans would tell their children about me, the Unstoppable Great Red Dragon Sen! Ga,ga,ga!" Ray started to let out a weird laugh, one that sounded as if it belonged to a beast more so than a human.

'What the hell is going on, Vincent?' Quinn asked, hoping that he wasn't just going crazy.

'Unfortunately, I'm as lost as you on this one. Perhaps you should ask Ray for a bit of context.' Vincent suggested.

"So, you were something above a Demon tier beast? Should I picture you like a red version of the Dragon guarding this tablet then?' Quinn asked.

"Please, do you really think I was that weak?" Ray replied in disdain. "Not to belittle my scaly friend on the outside, but do you really think someone like that could grant nearly all the abilities that exist today?"

"Alas, as powerful as I was, I had been tricked. I was taught a harsh lesson, you see. Someone had wished for me to help the humans but as Sen I had remained stubborn, so they made me live life as a human and through that I learned to care for them. Ultimately, I ended up doing just what was wanted of me, and to my shock I did so out of my own volition."

"I am happy to hear that even so many years later one of my descendants is also helping out the human race. I fought hard for this planet, and while I know how heavy that burden is, I'm happy that with you humanity should be in good hands."

For all his newfound enthusiasm, a lot of Ray's words went right through Quinn who he was busy trying to wrap his head around what he really was. If he had Dragon blood and Vampire blood inside of him‚Ä¶ did he even have any human blood running through his veins? However, as crazy as everything sounded, Quinn felt like the tablet had no reason to lie.

Dragons, just like vampires were things that should belong in fairy tales, yet they had to have come from somewhere. If the existence of vampires were real, then why couldn't he believe in real dragons as well. Not just some Demon tier beast that stood behind him. He just never thought that he would be related to them.

"So about this sword... it definitely is not a beast weapon, but did it belong to you?" Quinn asked, trying to change the topic to something easier to understand.

"No." Ray answered and this time his voice became more concerned and less playful. "That sword belonged to a dear friend of mine. It helped us on our journey, and it looks like it found a way to help you out on yours as well. However, that sword doesn't have anything to do with our family line."

"Truth be told, I do not know much about it, but I do know that there is someone who might. There is a being that I knew back in the past during my time. She should still be prancing around even today. You might have even met her since she loves to meddle in things."

"During my time she went by Bliss. Seek her out‚Ä¶ or wait until she seeks you out. Since you have my blood it should happen sooner or later. I'm sure she will tell you more about the sword."

[New quest received]

[Meet with the Divine being]

'Divine being‚Ä¶is this the Bliss person he was talking about?'

The light on the tablet started to fade again, and Quinn could tell that the time to speak was running out.

"It looks like our time is coming to an end. You have my blood running through your veins, and if you really are a Talen, then the Dalki won't even be worth your time. Just continue to grow, get stronger and evolve. As one of my blood there will be no cap for you. The Talen family is able to go even beyond anyone's expectations, trust me on that."

Hearing these words, Quinn thought of another quest he had received.

[Become something beyond a Vampire lord]

For some reason, after his little talk with Ray, Quinn was feeling more confident than ever. The tiredness he felt before, the defeats he had suffered, he realised that a small part of him had started to give up hope.

It had started to doubt if we could manage to get strong enough to stop them, but now there was a new ray of hope.
