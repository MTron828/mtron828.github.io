Chapter 1113 - Taming a beast

It was a tough ride as they went from the large Cursed ship, all the way back to earth. Not because they had run into any problems on their way or anything, but just because the group of people going this time weren‚Äôt exactly the friendliest bunch, nor did they get on well with each other.

The two girls who were interested in Quinn had spent most of their time being petty towards the other, while also trying to avoid each other. Making sure to shut the bathroom door, even if the other was waiting outside. Leaving the kettle empty if they knew who the next person was.‚Äã‚Äã

At least Brock and Eno kept to themselves, although whenever Quinn did stumble upon the duo they seemed to be scheming things on their own.

Then there was also the group of three people who Sam had introduced. The first person was Chucky, whose ability hadn‚Äôt been high levelled originally, but after the mission of looking after Sil he had been well compensated. Thanks to that money he procured the ability books he had needed and had managed to raise his ability to level seven.

The next one that had come on board was another of the Cursed leaders, Megan. According to Sam, Dennis had been completely against the idea. If she was going, then he wanted to come along, but Sam had reassured him that with Quinn, she would perhaps be more safe from an attack then if something was to happen on the ship, and they needed a certain amount of power to defend themselves.

As for the last person Quinn recognised her, but he was unable to put his finger on where and when they had met. Hana was a girl with short spiked hair, who had her hands banged up all the way to her forearms, reminding him of the martial arts god in ways. She was a person who was close to Wevil and part of the Parasite faction and had a level six ability.

Although there were those from their faction that had higher levels, Sam admitted that after the announcement many had asked not to be sent, now that they knew who they were. Although they didn‚Äôt want to leave the Cursed faction, and would have gone with Quinn if ordered, he could tell they felt uncomfortable.

‚ÄôIt might be just me but this whole atmosphere reminds me of school. People always had their own little groups there as well.‚Äô Quinn thought.

"I wouldn‚Äôt worry about anything." Logan spoke up, as he could see the concern on Quinn‚Äôs face. The two of them were at a side table that was similar to a bar bench. They could sit on the edge, and watch everyone else as they did their own thing. Little Borden was on the table, and looked to be doing some stretches.

"I think with Brock and Eno, we can lower our guard a bit. It‚Äôs been a while but they haven‚Äôt done anything out of the ordinary, and it seems like they really do want to make sure the Dalki don‚Äôt get their hands on that dragon." Logan explained.

Just then, Fex decided to join them, and before sitting down he raised his hands in the air above Borden nearly three times his height. The next second, Borden bent his knees and leapt up, touching the top of Fex‚Äôs hand, even hitting it away.

"I see you‚Äôre just as strong as ever, I‚Äôm glad not all the Dalki are as strong as you, otherwise I might not be alive standing today." Fex said, as he sat down next to Quinn on his right side. "You might be right Logan, but I still think we should be careful.

"He is the one that told everyone he was going into eternal slumber but never did, the person who tricked Arthur, and also the one that justified everything he did with I Quinn by calling them tests." Fex argued. "So although we can trust that he might not be out there to kill us, I still think we need to be careful. On top of that, what about the Vampire World?"

"The way I think Eno sees it, is that the Dalki need both parts of the Dragon, correct? But then aren‚Äôt both halves equally important as well? In some ways, I think we should at least warn Bryce that the Dalki may be coming after them as well."

"There might be a lot of vampires I don‚Äôt get along with there, but there are few I really care about. Most importantly my sister, my father, the thirteenth family and other people I still care about are also there." Fex explained.

Fex was right, but there was a slight reason why Quinn wasn‚Äôt too worried, his system. Perhaps he was being over reliant on it, but if anyone attempted to attack the tenth castle or the fourteenth castle, he should get a message, and he was sure he would do so if the Dalki did come to attack.

"I don‚Äôt think the Dalki forces are large enough to go after two places at once." Logan replied. "There can‚Äôt be too many of them, especially since they can‚Äôt make anymore, the energy from the first dragon was almost all used up, that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt create enough of the green liquid injection for Borden, however it sounds like this green one is alive and kicking."

Eventually, Helen had shoved Layla while trying to get a snack from the table, and Layla once again, was thrown to the side and had fallen into Mona. Hitting her on her back, making her drop her purple lipstick she was placing on her lips at the time.

"Will you stop it?! I feel like I‚Äôm on board a ship full of children!" Mona shouted in annoyance. "I‚Äôm going to go mad if this continues. Quinn, aren‚Äôt you the leader around here? Punish them or at least say something before I will!"

"Erghh..." Quinn hesitated as he didn‚Äôt know what to say. "How much longer do we have until we arrive?" He asked meekly.

"It looks like we‚Äôre nearly there." Shiro said as he pointed at the vast blue ocean. They had already gone through the space teleporting station, and had arrived at earth, but seeing the water was making Quinn‚Äôs stomach act a little strange. He tried to avoid looking at the sea, while placing his hands on his stomach.

"Are you getting sick just looking at the ocean?" Logan asked. "I understood when we were in the small submarine but we‚Äôre simply flying over it now."

"It‚Äôs not that." Quinn replied. "It‚Äôs just I‚Äôm starting to remember the last time... who knows what creatures are in there?"

Thinking back, Logan did recall that they had run into a giant beast that was also located in the water.

"Are you talking about that giant beast in the water? That beast should also be at a high tier, and might be quite handy to have." Logan said.

"Maybe it will serve as good practice." Eno interrupted their conversation, it appeared that despite him talking to Brock he had been listening in the whole time, but in some ways Quinn wanted Eno to know what he thought of him and the words spoken about him

"Should we really exhaust ourselves like that? We don‚Äôt even know what level it‚Äôs at?" Fex argued against it.

"Not for fighting, but we can use this beast to test just how strong Sil‚Äôs abilities are after copying everyone." Eno explained.

"Oh, that ‚Äôs how his ability works." Chucky commented, listening in on everything, but he might as well have said nothing, because no one had heard him.

Soon the eyes turned onto Sil, who looked a little shy raising his shoulders trying to block the eyes on him.

"I can give it a go, but I don‚Äôt really know how the taming ability works, like what happens if I can‚Äôt tame it, didn‚Äôt you say we have to beat it up or something?" Sil questioned.

"It looks like you might have to learn on the go!" Brock shouted, as he quickly steered the ship to the side. A large tentacle had appeared out of the water. The tentacle‚Äôs width was as big as the sh.i.p.s and if it had hit, then they would have all been slammed into the water.

"Get to land, hurry!" Quinn shouted, a little more afraid than usual. FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After staring out of the way, Brock landed the ship quite quickly on the sandy beach, and soon, the large head of the giant creature, that was pointy shaped, and a large singular eye could be seen, poking out of the top of the water. It looked quite similar to that of a giant squid.

Everyone quickly got off from the ship, and as long as they stayed on the beach it looked like the squid was going to continuously attack them.

[Demi-god tier beast]

‚ÄôI knew it was strong, but I didn‚Äôt think there would be something that high tier still on earth, surrounding the island. Just what is this place?!‚Äô Quinn thought.

Stepping in front of all the others calm as ever with her pointy hat was Mona.

"You need to learn how to use the ability, right? Well I guess this is a perfect way to show you, and it looks like I might be able to get myself a new pet while I‚Äôm at it." She said with a big grin.

"Remember, I too was one of the leaders of the Big Four, my strength doesn‚Äôt just rely on the beast I have with me. You guys stay back!" She said, as she charged forward.
