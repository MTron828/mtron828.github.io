Edvard looked back at Quinn and stared directly into his eyes. He was pulled in by time, and didn't even look at the scenery around him nor had he quite taken in what happened.

Because, the look in his eyes was gentle and had a hint of sadness, as if it was meeting a long time friend. The thing was with being a vampire that lived 1000's and 1000's of years, one got to read emotions on a face a lot better.

If they really wanted to, they could put the time into becoming an expert in nearly every field, as long as they kept up with the new developments, but reading faces was something a person did naturally. The heightened senses, going through the same situation again and again. It made them an expert at reading people, and only those that had experienced as much as them were good at hiding it.

For Quinn, technically he had lived a long life, but in reality the years he had experienced were few, so his emotions always showed easily on his face. Which was why Edvard wondered, why did this person look at him in such a way?

In his mind, there were no memories of him and Quinn. They had all been removed by Malik. In its place were stories told about how a vampire, no, a demon from the original world where they had come from, had manipulated him but thankfully they had saved him.

Even the beatings he had taken and the weakened state that affected his internal energy, rather than all of that punishment coming from Jim, in his memories it had come from Quinn.

Based on what he could remember, he had no choice but to believe it, and go on with his life, yet Edvard always felt that something was missing.

An original getting tricked, when why? Why would they even choose someone like him, when there were more capable Originals. In his head it didn't quite make sense, which was why he had decided to just distance himself away from others and everything that was happening.

As for why he had gotten involved now, it was because of the simple words, the Punisher's Convent. An old friend in Arthur, a promise and words that were only known by a few, that was why he had decided to help.

With all of these thoughts in his head, it was why Edvard gave a simple reply.

"That would be nice." Edvard answered.

The other leaders similar to Edvard had been locked in battle against each other. They were using a great amount of strength, but at the same time weren't attempting to kill each other. The originals had been around each other for a long time.

They had their differences during those times, but other than with the 1st original king Laxmus, they hardly had large-scale direct confrontations. It was hard for them in some ways to fight each other like this, once again.

Because of this as well, all of them felt like they had a connection with one another. Something that set them apart from the other vampires, because they were the first of their kind.

They could feel that one of them had died. They all paused and turned their heads to see the scene of blood on the ground. They didn't quite understand what happened, apart from the fact one of them had died.

The reason for their confusion was because there was no rise in power. They couldn't feel the overflowing vampire aura coming from Quinn as it came last time.

Even then, if one was to attack with blood aura, or any type of energy, surely they would have felt it. What it meant was that the attack that Quinn had dealt, was purely a physical one, and it had reduced Wallace to that.

With a burst of his hand, a slap. It was like Quinn had swatted a bug into the ground. An attack so strong in pure strength that it could break through Wallace's defence, his healing, and all of his energy.

With this display alone, not a single original was going to try and stop him. Quinn had already surpassed all of them before, but this was to the level where their interference would be even less than a simple annoyance.

"I'm going to end this war." Quinn said. "Tell me, where is Jim?"

"He should be around 10 kilometres south from here. He won't be any further than that." Edvard answered. He wanted to say more, he wanted to warn him about Ray, and the others that would try to stop him, but for some reason he felt like there was no reason for him to worry.

At the same time Quinn had already left, he was already running, and there was no chance for Edvard to even catch up with him.

———

Quinn was running through the torn city, and around him he could smell the dead. He could feel it in the air, the blood that was everywhere. The anger was bulging up inside him, but it was doing so in a calm manner, he couldn't quite explain it.

It was almost a similar feeling to when he was a celestial. Rather than anger coming out of his fists, or through his voice and aura, it was coming out through his actions.

The reason for killing the original rather than giving him a beating, was because Quinn could see it. If he hadn't stopped the attack it would have been a fatal blow to Edvard.

For getting Edvard involved in this, for him keeping his family's secret and allowing them to live a normal life for a short while, he at least owed him this.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

'I have to trust that the others have managed to break Sil out. Since everyone is still fighting, then that most likely means that something had to have gone wrong.

'I can teleport to Minny through the shadow and see what's going on, but Jim is here. He is one half of the puzzle that I need to stop now. I will kill him and make sure he never comes back.

'I know that won't outright stop the war straight away, but it's one of the first steps to this whole thing. If I can do that, then I can worry about what will happen to Ray after, or I can just ignore him completely.'

The new armour Quinn wore, that he had travelled the whole universe to create, he knew it was powerful. He could tell from just using it and wearing it now.

However, there were two problems that he had, one was Ray himself. His strength, it was hard to gauge. Even in the last fight, it never felt like Ray had been taking him seriously, as if he still had a lot more to give.

His own armour was powerful, and synced up with him perfectly.

'I have to remember, he was a being that at one point gave all of his powers to humanity. The powers that were used and that stopped the first Dalki war.'

During the last fight though, Quinn did notice that Ray hadn't used any abailties. It seemed like even though he was using the demon tier dragon's body as a host and his old armour, he was not at the level he was once before, this was not the Ray of the past he was going up against.

The second problem was, Quinn had no time to test out all of the skills of his new armour set. Wearing multiple pieces of armour, made from the strongest god slayers, there were bound to be some strong active, passive skills, and there was even a set skill that Quinn had never seen before.

'Before I get into a fight, I should take a quick look at all of them again, and just give myself a reminder of what they do.'

Out of all of these things, there was also something the system stated about his equipment that he had never seen before.
