Energize and Prepare

Thanks to Asura's grand attack, the distance between Quinn and him had increased. This meant that during his next attack, Quinn had enough time to enter his shadow space away from the fight, and that was where he was currently sitting down as he racked his head on what to do next.

The one thing the shadow space did give him was time, he had time to think of a solution, or perhaps try a few things, however, his shadow space also affected him as well. Even if he spent a long time in here, the energy he had lost during the fight wouldn't recover.

Meaning his Qi, his stamina or anything else, wouldn't recover, nor would his health, that was unless he had a couple of humans in the shadow space. He would always be able to feast on them to gain health back, but that wasn't something Quinn was willing to do.

Keeping someone in his space just for the sake of food, and how long would they even have to be in here.

It was always a problem for him, since items were unable to be stored in the shadow space, such as weapons, flasks and so on. It was the reason why those that were in the shadow space didn't just randomly stumble upon the items left in there.

At the same time, in his inventory, where his weapons and items where stored, living things were unable to be put in there and that included blood.

Either way, him being in the shadow space just meant he was delaying the inevitable because as soon as he left the area, he would be in the same state as he entered. The other thing was, he would return to the same spot as well.

Of course, he could use the shadow link to head back to MInny, but that would defeat the purpose of him coming here in the first place.

'I have to think of a way to beat him with everything I have right now. Is there something with the blood shadow I could use? I also have to think about the way Asura fights as well. He has six arms, where all of his energy stems from including the energy blasts, so how do I counter this?'

With all of this in mind, Quinn had to think about his health as well. As low as it was, he would still have to use the Nitro Accelerate, making sure he could win this fight without getting hit one more time, otherwise this whole fight would be over.

His mind was flip flopping still because of this and whether or not to just use the Demon form, because it was too big of a risk. That was until he had come up with a solution, playing with the blood shadow he had an idea, one that he was sure would work.

Standing up, Quinn started to use his powers, to summon them in a way he needed them, and when he was ready, it was time for him to return.

Asura was searching the piece of land he was on frantically, believing that Quinn might have hidden himself. He didn't move to other pieces of land because he had a feeling that he would be here, and he was right as the shadow portal appeared, where he had last seen him, and once again, he had slightly changed his appearance compared to before.

Actually that was incorrect, Quinn's appearance was the same, but now around him there was something different.

Around Quinn's body, there were shadow circles that were floating. In total there were six of them behind his back lining up in the shape of a circle. They had the same colour as the shadow blood that encased his hands, being dark red in colour with a red glow.

"So you have six circles now, is that meant to be a big deal!" Asura shouted as he moved his hands forward, and when he reached Quinn he went to hit him once more with a flurry of punches.

Quinn used some of his hands to block the attack, but he knew with two limbs against six he would eventually lose out. When Asura could see an opening he went to punch Quinn right on his rib, that was until his fist was stopped.

Where Quinn's side was open, there was now one of the floating red circles that completely stopped his attacks.

Asura tried his best to ignore this and continued to punch in other areas, but more of the circles started to move, as they blocked each and every one of his strikes, while doing so the circles were moving in place just as fast as Asura was as well.

"There weren't just six circles for no reason." Quinn said, as he used his two hands to strike Asura hard in the stomach, he moved back a bit, but planted his foot firmly as he moved forward, continuing to punch.

The circles still moved in the way, doing whatever it could to protect Quinn, and the second hit, had hit Asura again, causing him to flinch for a second and allowing another opening for Quinn, as he slammed a fist this time on top of his head.

'This fight... it's over.' Quinn thought.

The idea he had come up with was possible by pushing his powers to its limit. Condensing his shadow and mixing it with blood, Quinn had used most of what was available of his shadow. Although he had unlimited MC cells, he still had a limit on his output and most of it was being used.

However, Quinn did keep some of the shadow so he could block other attacks and use his other skills such as the shadow clone skill if he needed it, but none of these things would help him in the fight.

That's when he created something that could help him, the blood circles. These circles were condensed shadow and blood just like what was covering his hands, and they could block hits just as well.Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

There was another problem with the shadow, and that was the speed to use it, that's why Quinn covered his hands with the shadow in the first place, but there was a big difference compared to the shadow powers and the Blood Shadow, it was the fact that it had blood in it.

Because of this, it meant that Quinn was also able to influence it with his absolute blood control. In doing so, he could move it fast like a blood bullet, and fast enough to block Asura's hits.

The shadow circles continued to block Asura's punches, but with just that alone, it wouldn't be enough for him to win the fight, and time was against him with his Nitro accelerate running out, but Quinn wasn't worried, because there was one more thing.

Using both of his hands, Quinn had pulled one of the arms to the side with all his strength, then lifted his other hand in the air. While in the air, the shape of the condense blood shadow around his hand started to change, into that of a sharp blade.

Swinging it down, Quinn had hit right into the shoulder joint of Asura, the strike was large as blood aura flowed down and into the wound. Quinn was moving the attack back and forth like chainsaw ready to cut the arm off but it was stubborn.

His attack had only gotten through half of Asura's arm as he screamed into the air. That was until the effect of the blood shadow took place, and the second attack force went through, allowing for the blade to completely cut off Asura's arm.

It fell to the floor, and now what was once six... was five. Never before had Asura had his precious arms torn off from his body, it was a first for him and he realised something. Asura didn't want to admit it, but he too could tell that it was the end.
