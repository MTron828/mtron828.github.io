Chapter 2191 God Slayer 5 (Part 4)

Dealing with two arms from Asura was hard enough but now he had six of them all connected to his body. Rather than his energy and strength being split between these arms, instead Quinn could feel that all of these arms had the same amount of energy.

It felt like his opponent had just gotten three times stronger. The shadow mist was still around where Asura was, but it would need some time for the Shadow particles to be inhaled by Asura to take effect and before he knew it, Asura had leapt from his position, flying through the air right at Quinn again.

'I thought with the Nitro Accelerate, I would at least be able to keep him in the mist for a while to slow him down. This was what I was afraid of, now the Shadow mist is practically useless.' Quinn thought, but there were still other things he could do.

Moments before Asura landed with his fists, Quinn ran to the side. Asura had crashed into the ground and rocks were sent flying everywhere making it hard for both of them to see. In the middle of the debris falling, Asura felt something wrap around both of his arms.

They grinded against his skin and went past his gauntlets, digging in his biceps. Looking at them, they looked like sharp razor chains, and on the other end he could see Quinn.

"I am not weak!" Quinn shouted, pulling with all his might, and Asura was lifted in the air and slammed into the ground from the use of the Twin tail chains, the other soul weapon in Quinn's arsenal.

At the same time, Quinn had prepared something else, because right above where Asura had landed was a giant blood sword. It fell down aiming to split the god slayer in half.

In order to distract him, Quinn started to swing his chain blades at Asura, aiming for his body and his legs. They were making small scratches on his skin, but with his other arms Asura was able to block most of the attacks.

Then with his two main arms, he lifted them, grabbing onto the large blood sword. His knees bent as the sheer force of the large blood sword was more than he expected.

Gritting his teeth, Asura let out a loud yell as he pushed with all his might and with both arms chucking the blood sword back up. The sheer strength of Asura was more powerful than Quinn's blood control.

While it was hovering in the air, Asura started to punch the air with both of his arms. The energy blasts that would come off from them, just like before, hit the sword and each time it did, it broke and diminished the blood aura. The large blood sword was being destroyed until it was eventually nothing.

Now Asura had his full focus on Quinn, and before Quinn was able to go back or try something else, he had grabbed onto the chains with four of his arms, then yanked Quinn forward.

Now he was the one in the air, the twin tail chains were attached inside of Quinn's body so there was no way he could act quickly. At the last moment, Asura let go of the Twin tail, and spun his whole body swinging out all of his arms.

The first three arms hit Quinn's body and then the next three did, hitting Quinn off into the distance again. While in the air, regaining his position, Quinn made sure to land on his feet, or at least he tried to, as he skidded across the floor on one knee.

His face was bruised and blood was spilling from his mouth.

'Is he going to die here?' Mundus thought, watching things from really far off this time. In fact, he was actually in the celestial space watching this match, rather than on the ground like during the fights before. He didn't want to be caught in the middle of this fight.

'After what I said, he's being stubborn about using the form he had against the Behemoth. I understand why, but it might cost you your life.'

Nitro accelerate was still active, and Quinn didn't want to waste the time he had, otherwise it would start to eat into his health. He dashed forward and started to swing his arms, aiming for all the right places.

Not only was Quinn punching, but he would also kick as well as he used all the training and skills he had over the years. Red aura was leaving his legs and fists as he threw out each blow.

However, with his six hands, equally Asura was matching them head on, as he threw his fists out as well. Knuckle was hitting knuckle. With each hit it sounded as if explosions were going off.

Not a single one of them were taking a breather, as they continued to throw out hit after hit, and the land they were on was being affected, it was almost disappearing, in that moment, Quinn saw an opening, he bent down with his knees and sprung up like a spring, lifting his knee it exploded right into Asura's chin.

His head tilted back for a second, before he used all the muscles in his neck to push down against Quinn's knee. Instead of Quinn hitting Asura up in the air, using his powerful chin, he pushed Quinn's knee and leg back into the ground and threw out a fist hitting Quinn right in the face sending him skidding backwards.

Asura wasn't letting up as he chased after Quinn. Seeing this, Quinn had to do something and started to form a mass amount of blood aura in his hand, condensing it down he had made a smaller version of the blood sword it was still large in size almost like a greatsword.

Swinging it down, Quinn tried to slice Asura in half one more time.

'Focus, concentrate the Qi in my body to give me strength, I'm using the second stage of Qi to make the sword even sharper and all my blood energy to break through!'

With all six hands, Asura caught the blood blade, he was holding on tight trying to push the sword back, but was unable to, the Blood aura continued and Quinn was powering it with his strong Qi.

The only thing Asura could do was push the sword to the side so it wouldn't hit him, and when the blood sword hit the ground, a large wall rose up. On the other side of the wall, the landmass had split off breaking and floating off in the distance.Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Not tiring for a second, Asura came right toward Quinn once more.

[Nitro Accelerate has ended]

"I need more time, I'll be back!" Quinn said, as he disappeared into a shadow portal and Asura's fist hit nothing but the air.

"Where did he go!!! Did he run away!" Asura shouted and banged the floor with all of his arms in anger.

Quinn had escaped to his shadow space, and was breathing relatively heavily. He had used a lot of all of his powers, it felt the same as when he was fighting against the phoenix the only difference was he had used so much energy in a short time compared to when fighting against the phoenix.

'I've tried to hurt him as much as I could, and I'm not sure, I was even able to put a large dent in him‚Ä¶ I got a few big hits in, but other than my physical punches none of my blood attacks got through.' Quinn thought.

During the fight though, he did notice that with the large blood sword, both of the Blood attacks Asura had stopped them rather than take them head on. Which meant Quinn was able to hurt him if he could get a hit on him.

"Alright, while I'm in here let's do this properly." Quinn said to himself as he sat down and meditated.

Back on the ground, Asura was still looking everywhere for Quinn, he continued to shout and scream, letting out heaps of energy. It was as if it was endless for him, but finally he heard footsteps on the ground and turned his head.

"There you are!" Asura shouted, but noticed that there was something different.

Shadow had covered Quinn's hands in a condensed form just like before, but it wasn't just on his hands, as it trailed behind his body like a flame. Then there was the colour of the shadow itself which was completely different.

Rather than the normal purple colour the shadow would take on, it looked to be like a dark red, and all of the shadow that was glowing off Quinn's body was glowing red.

"Rather than protect, it's time for this shadow to attack."
