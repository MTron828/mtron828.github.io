Chapter 1741: Betrayed.

There was a pause from Peter as he looked at the Guardian in front of him. A lot of the built-up energy he had disappeared, and the skin on his body was still somewhat hurting. However, it wasn't to the point where it had an adverse effect on him, and because the rage overran his thoughts, he hadn't even thought about what would have happened if he was hit again by the strange shadow.

"I know you, don't I?" Peter asked, and quickly he started to cancel his transformation, so more of his usual appearance started to show.

It was easy for Peter now to turn his celestial form on and off, so he didn't think it would be a problem, but knowing this person and not being able to put his finger on who it was, was seriously bugging him.

"It's you!" The Guardian finally responded, "I... didn't think you would still be alive, and unlike you, my appearance has changed greatly from before."

"But, you're right, we once did know each other. I am Ashley."

At first, the name didn't click in Peter's head, but soon he started to remember. Ashley was Paul's right-hand man. He was the leader of the vampire soldiers, who had eventually turned into the vampire Corps Unit.

Ashley in front of Peter looked older and more rugged but still had a strong, powerful body and an air of confidence around him. Only his eyes seemed much dull compared to before.

"Yes, I remember now...Quinn saved you guys." Peter slowly spoke, "He saved you when the vampires were going to kill you."

"You know, that bastard of a boss of yours tried killing Quinn? So what the hell are you doing on the other side?"

Peter started to gather his celestial energy again, changing his form again, ready for a fight. The others seemed to be fairing alright against the Guardians and beasts, but honestly, Peter didn't know if they could win this. In his head, the way for them to win this battle was to take out Laxmus.

Peter began to charge forward, but when he did, his foot touched the ground, and he tried to push off, but it felt slightly lighter. That's when he noticed it was touching the shadow, slowing down his movements.

Looking back up, Peter saw a blood slash heading his way. He covered his head by crossing his arms. The attack had hit, and it was quite powerful, pushing Peter somewhat, but it did not harm him.

"If all the guardians are as weak as you, we have nothing to worry about!" Peter roared.

Peter tried to move his tail head, but it was already encased by even more shadow which wrapped around his tail head like it was an arm holding onto it.

"This shadow is strange. I can feel him holding on to it, and I can't move my tail head!" Peter thought.

The shadow seemed to contain some traits similar to Quinn's, while at the same time, there were apparent differences. It was the same as when Peter had punched the shadow Laxmus had created.

And the form of the shadow felt more solid than Quinn's, and there was a limit to Quinn's. Because for him, each hit would consume a large amount of MC cells.

Peter somewhat understood when Laxmus had blocked his attack, but now one of the guardians was also able to jam his head-tail.

Ashley was already on top of him, throwing out his fist towards Peter. A red aura covered his arm, making it look like a blade. Moving his hand, Peter grabbed the fist, holding it in place. The red aura had pierced through his hand, and it was bleeding, but Peter didn't care.

"I think you guys have gotten a bit too confident thinking that there is no one out there who can beat you. I need to show you your place!" Peter shouted, throwing out his fist. Then, taking the shadow off the head-tail, Ashley tried to move it to block the attack.

The shadow could move at a fast speed, faster than when Quinn used it, but it wasn't fast enough as Peter's fist pounded Ashley's chest, causing a crack on the best armour he was wearing and sending him flying back through the air.Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

While in midair, Ashley used the shadow to create small wings while also infusing his blood aura. The shadow blood wings looked somewhat horrifying! and it didn't help when Ashley flapped them to slow himself down and went on one knee, holding his chest.

Curling his lip air, he hissed at Peter baring his fangs. "You don't understand anything!" Ashley shouted with a bit of blood dripping from his mouth.

"You think I'm on the wrong side? I just realised what the right side was. You are the one in the wrong!" Ashley shouted, standing up. "If Paul were alive, he would understand our choice! You are trying to save the humans, why?!"

"Are you forgetting something, you idiot?" Peter raised his eyebrows, "You were a human as well. Maybe because you have been a vampire for so long, you have forgotten that."

"No, I haven't, and they are not like me," Ashley replied. "They... they kill their own, they killed my family. My family members were humans as well, but just because I was a vampire, they murdered them. Do you understand? Do you understand the pain I went through!?"

"And as for Quinn. He promised us that he would find a way to turn us back into a human, but he never did, and I'm not the only one that has experienced things like this happen to them!"

"This is why if Quinn can't turn us back, there is another solution to solve the problem. Turn everyone into a vampire. Let them suffer through what we have experienced!"

They were strong emotions coming from Ashley, and Peter could somewhat understand it, but none of this was their fault. A few immoral people were running it for everyone, and while they were away, they had managed to go down the wrong end.

Gathering all the strength in his leg, Peter ran forward and then pushed off using his head-tail from the ground, kicking it up and giving him extra strength to move forward. It was so fast Ashley had no time to react at all, and his chest was still hurting from the pain before.

Before he knew it. Peter had grabbed his mouth. And then lifted his whole body into the air.

"Because you once knew Quinn and helped him out, I will spare you. So get out of my way!" Peter threw Ashley away like a rag doll, crashing it into the floor. This created a large crater underneath, and the attack was so strong it caused the others to look over at what was happening.

Letting go, it looked like Ashley was almost dead because he wasn't moving, but Peter didn't care. Instead, he turned his gaze towards Laxmus.

"You're next."

Meanwhile, Vincent wasn't going on the offensive against the bear or the Guardian. His speed was fast, but not on the level of Jake Green or Peter. Instead, he had stronger blood powers he could use to finish them in a single blow.

However, he was worried that if he went after one of them, the other would be able to attack him, and without knowing the full strength of these guardians, this was a risky plan. Finally though, the guardian fighting against Vincent, who had a mask covering his face, charged in.

So far, he had just been making blood attacks, which confused Vincent because they weren't as strong as he had expected. In fact, they were a little too weak.

Now as the Guardian came with his fists, Vincent was on guard, assuming the enemy's hand-to-hand combat skills would be better, but something unexpected happened.

"Just pretend to fight." A voice suddenly entered his ears. It was the Guardian who he was fighting against.

Blocking the first punch, Vincent could tell that the Guardian had receded all the energy at the last moment, significantly lowering the attack power.

"I'm on your side. I promise you that, Vincent. This is why I need you to listen to me."

"If you want the others to live, it would be best to leave with me and let Laxmus take you. Otherwise, everyone will die."
