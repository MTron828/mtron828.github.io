Chapter 1263 - A Gift From Quinn

Erin and Leo were very interested in finding out what had exactly happened while they had been away. Walking alongside Sam around the Cursed ship they noticed that there were many changes here and there. Certain parts had been remodeled, different areas had been strengthened and more security systems had been implemented.

'Did the Cursed ship suffer from an attack while we were away?' Leo thought. 'I guess that much should be expected with the human race at war again. Have they gone out to help out other planets?'

"I'm sorry, Sam." Erin apologised, after noticing through her ability that there were far less people on the Cursed ship than the last time they had been there. "It looks like you guys have been attacked during our absence. If we had been here, probably less lives would have been lost. Just what happened that there are so few people left?"

It took a second for Sam to figure out what Erin meant by this, but then he remembered that he had yet to fill them in.

"We have lost a lot of lives, but not as many as you seem to believe‚Ä¶" Sam replied. "The actual reason why there aren't that many on the Cursed ship right now is because many chose to leave the ship."

"After we were attacked, our Cursed faction temporarily made the Earthborn group's Shelter on planet Caladi into our base. Although the Cursed ship is back and running again, many decided to stay there for the time being."

"As I said, a lot happened while you guys were away, but we pulled through. I'm sure the two of you were busy doing your own important thing as well. Heck, we even heard that we have you to thank for defeating a four spiked Dalki on Earth!"

The duo thought they had been quite careful at the time, but a blind swordsman wasn't exactly a common occurrence, making him easy for many to remember. With Pure seemingly having erased all of their traces the public believed that Leo was the one to have finished the enemy on his own.

Finally, the trio had reached Quinn's private training room where the surprise had been left for Leo and Erin. Even before they entered the room, through the Glathrium door the two of them could feel the intense energy inside, and the hallway feeling a little cooler. The closer they got to the door the cooler the air felt.

For Erin though, it was simultaneously a familiar and foreign feeling. Someone who had ice abilities was used to this chill, but it didn't quite feel the same as an ability. After Sam put in the code the door slid open, and the two of them could clearly see what was in front of them.

"Leo, do you see that‚Ä¶it's the‚Ä¶'' Erin was unable to speak normally as she naturally walked forward, drawn to the weapon.

"For even my own student to forget that I lack sight." Leo shook his head. "I do feel it though. There is no other weapon that I have ever felt that comes close to it. This has to be a Demon tier weapon."

Leo and Erin had not been present when Oscar had shown the Demon tier weapon to everyone, so this was the first time the two were in its presence. Being near a Demon beast item or weapon for the first time certainly had an effect on everyone.

Its raw energy was calling out to the both of them, for them to pick it up and use it immediately.

"It looks like you like the gift Quinn left you then." Sam smiled from behind them.

"This is the gift Quinn left for Leo? Just what happened for something like this to end up in the Cursed faction's hand? Why doesn't he want to use it for himself? Isn't this too much?" Erin was shocked that Quinn wouldn't use such a thing for himself, yet she couldn't keep her eyes off the weapon.

"As I said, a lot has happened while you guys were away. Quinn actually has his own Demon tier item. To fully utilise the power of this one he would have to incorporate it into his set of skills."

"However, Quinn has gained another special sword that he claims suits his fighting style far more than this one. Additionally, he doesn't think that it's a good idea for all our fighting power to be focused on just one person.

"With the war going on, and the enemy turning out to be far stronger than we could have imagined, it seemed wiser to give the weapon to someone better suited and who could be better suited to use a Demon tier Sword than a swordsman?"

Walking up to the sword, Leo stared at it, sensing its powers. He certainly did have an interest in obtaining a stronger weapon. That was his goal of coming back here, after all, but Leo wasn't used to receiving gifts as big as this from others. He had always obtained things himself, the fact that it came from a student he used to teach, didn't make it any less strange.

"This is no small surprise." Leo grabbed the hilt of the sword, and he could feel his whole body run with a cold shiver. He lifted it up with a single hand, with complete ease. It looked strange from the outside since the sword was three quarters the size of his body.

Giving it a test, he started to swing it in separate movements. First a step forward slicing it in an arc shape. Next from below, almost skimming the bottom of the ground, and finally from over his head stopping before the large blade would hit the ground.

To both Erin and Sam who were watching, just these three simple strikes looked incredibly impressive.

'Even with a large weapon like this, he can control the flow of the sword so it doesn't feel unnatural. He is a master of all swords, not just the katana blade.' Erin thought as she watched him, a slight feeling of envy rose inside of her.

"This weapon‚Ä¶" Leo said slowly, looking at it once more, giving it another swing to make sure. "It does not suit me. Neither the size nor shape fit my personal fighting style."

"However, I agree with what Quinn said and his reasoning for wishing to give me the blade. I assume since he gifted it to me, it's mine to do with what I want, correct?"

At first, Sam couldn't believe what he was hearing. Was Leo really going to reject the Demon tier Sword? Even if it wasn't what he was used to, the extra power from it alone would increase his strength, or he could switch between weapons, but after his question, Sam understood what he was planning.

"Of course." Sam smiled. "You know what Quinn is like and I'm sure he will be happy with the decision you are making."

It was then that Leo started to walk over to Erin.

"You needed Two blades, remember? I remember one of the blades you used to have was similar to this one. With this weapon, I'm sure you'll not just be able to revive your family's swordsmanship, but bring it to new heights."

With this Leo handed over the weapon and Erin held it firmly in her hands. The cold feeling enveloped her entire body but it was nothing that she couldn't handle. She found herself naturally grasping the handle with both of her hands, and before even saying anything, she immediately gave it a few swings.

When swinging it in a crescent shape, she allowed the blade to slightly take control, lifting her feet off the ground, going straight into the next movement. Her body was now a good meter and a half in the air, and striking down again, she spun her whole body a full spin, until finally landing on the ground and completing a final sweep strike on the floor.

Seeing this, Sam was equally impressed with her sword skills, even though he was no swordsman. Being a vampire he was able to track her movements very carefully and he had seen his fair share of fights. He could tell that the movements were just as fluid as the ones that Leo had produced.

'Indeed, seeing her just swing the Demon tier Sword around, nobody will be able to complain about her having it.' Sam thought.

It was then that Erin snapped out of her daze. She wasn't meant to accept the sword in the first place, but her body had taken over the moment she held it.

"I can't. Leo, this was your gift from Quinn. You need a weapon and it will be far better in your hands." Erin said, bowing down and holding the sword out for Leo to take.

"Yes and I believe I just said that since it's my gift I can do what I want with it. Remember, I still have a gift from that fellow from before. I'm certain that Alex will be able to make a fine weapon out of it, one that he can customise for my use." Leo stated.

"While I appreciate your sentiment, do you honestly believe a weapon that utilises ice powers of all things would be better in my hands? I'm sure that you felt it yourself when using that sword, so you should know that answer."

"The moment you took it, I felt its power spike up, something that didn't happen when I took it. I would say, even if you didn't want it, that blade has chosen you. Combine it with the skills you've learned, and continue to improve the skills of the current you."

In all honesty, Erin was happy that Leo didn't want the sword back, she had just felt like she had been undeserving of it. She hadn't achieved any great feat nor fought against a mighty foe and yet here she was receiving one of the strongest weapons in the world, but she had felt it. Just like what Leo had claimed, the moment she had touched it, it had felt so familiar to her.

Perhaps it was because of her lost ice powers, and the purpose of the weapon. Nonetheless now it was hers to keep.

"Thank you, Leo. Thank you Sam." Erin bowed to them both. "I promise to prove to everyone that I deserve to use this weapon."

"Haha, no need to thank me. I'm just the messenger boy, if you want to thank somebody besides Leo, thank Quinn the next time you see him." ReùíÇùíÇd the latest stories ùíên novùíÜlbin(.)com

Having improved in her strength by leaps and strides she was just wondering how much stronger she had gotten. With the Demon tier Sword in her hands, she couldn't help but consider herself becoming almighty, but that also made her think of one other thing.

'That women, the prophecy‚Ä¶is it really okay for me to have so much power? What happens, if what she said is true? What happens if at some point I‚Ä¶' Gripping the sword tightly, she shook her head. 'No, I've never believed in any of that crap and I won't start now. I won't let it happen!'
