Chapter 2364 ¬†Search for the Ultimate team (Part 3)

Nearly all the squads that had been sent out were led by the vampire knights, that was all apart from one. One of the leaders of the originals, Grenlet, had been sent out to search for Russ, considering there was a slight fear that he might fight back.

Unlike the others, there were next to no leads for Russ, because he had escaped in the middle of all the mess. While the others had decided to go where they wished, Russ' location was never found, but that didn't mean they had no way to find him.

When Logan was on the search for Magnus, he had upgraded his facial recognition software, to collect all the information and send it back to him. During this time, although it hadn't helped in finding Magnus, using it now allowed them to track where exactly Russ was staying.

It had come somewhat as a surprise, or not, that he had decided to settle down ¬†on one of the Graylash family's planets, but not in a built up city as such, but instead in a village once again.

The village only had a few hundred people, and when the vampires came through the small village, it had caused quite a stir among the locals, and they could see them all heading to a single household.

It was a simple house that looked somewhat like a giant mushroom, it had a single door, and was far apart from all the other houses in the village, secluded.

'From what we know about this person, I would say that the place he has chosen to live, doesn't suit his personality at all, but I have to keep on guard.'

Grenlet gave the door a few knocks, and when there was no answer, he decided to give it a forceful push, breaking the lock and entering inside. He looked to his left and right as he entered a small living room.

There was nothing out of the ordinary. Sitting in a single sofa seat, was the person they were looking for with a glass of wine in his hand, raising it toward them.

"It's awfully brave of you to enter my house when I haven't given you permission." Russ said. "I thought you vampires couldn't enter places without getting permission. Or was that just one of those rumours that get spread around? Well, it looks like that myth is ticked off."

Grenlet could tell that this human was incredibly confident. He thought that he might be off guard or afraid that the vampires had come after him, but instead he didn't show a hint of fear at all.

"We are not here to cause trouble." Grenlet said.

"Ah yes, and that's why they sent a weak vampire right to the front of my door." Russ replied.

Grenlet was unsure whether or not that was a dig at Grenlet, suggesting Russ was that much stronger, or if he was being sarcastic, suggesting that they had sent an original after him even though they wanted to talk peacefully.

"We have come to ask you a favour." Grenlet stated. "There is an important matter involving the entire human and vampire races, no, it's safe to say that this matter involves our entire universe. You had helped us with the great threat against Jim and Jack before, which is why we have come directly to ask you for your help again."

While Grenlet was speaking Russ was continuing to drink his drink and when he seemed to be done, he took a big swig trying to gulp it down in a single go.

"You want my help‚Ä¶ so tell me, why hasn't Quinn come to ask me for help himself. Or better yet, why doesn't he come here and force my hand once again, just like he did before.

"I'm guessing there is a reason he can't. So let me ask you, do you really think I would help someone that did that to me? If you want me to help, then he can come here and force my hand, and if you think you guys can try to force me, then go ahead and give it your best try.

"But if it's me against you guys, I'll tell you now, you don't stand a chance."

Grenlet was inclined to believe it was true. He had heard about the great strength he was able to summon at the time.

"Don't you understand, this is much more than simple grudge you have against one man." Grenlet said. "As I said before, this could very well affect our whole universe. Everyone you care about, everyone in this entire world would be destroyed and killed!"

Russ couldn't help but laugh.

"Do you not know who I am? Everyone I care about is dead. The only goal I had was killing the Blades and look at them. Every single one of them is dead as well. So if this entire world is to die, to be gone, then what do I care‚Ä¶ You have nothing you can use to responsibility to help those in need.

"We can't just sit by and do nothing and I believe even you have that convince me."

The other vampires felt like this was hopeless, a lost cause. The only good thing was it didn't look like Russ had a grudge against them. It wasn't as if he was going to attempt to take their lives.

"Although many may not be able to relate to you, the original vampires can." Grenlet said. "We have been in your situation more times than you can ever imagine. Yet we know there is more to it than meets the eye. With the power we have, we have the responsibility to help those in need.

"We can't just sit by and do nothing and I believe even you have that to a certain degree. Didn't you take all of the chained under your wing? Was there a reason why you chose to be the leader, why you brought them all together. Do you think it was as simple as just using them for your goal?

"And lastly, if you really felt that way, then why are you alive right now!"

Russ, for the first time, seemed to be somewhat speechless, as he didn't say anything. If one really felt the way he said, then surely they would have gone into an Eternal Slumber or something like that.

Russ stood up out of his chair, causing all the others to flinch back. They pulled out their aura and weapons, but Russ himself quickly did the same imitating the aura of the vampires, and the power he had exhibited was far more powerful than any of them.

"I already told you I am a lot stronger than you, so don't even try to fight me." Russ said, as he walked away and headed into another room.

The vampires stood there, wondering what to do. Did Russ just walk away, were they supposed to chase him, or just let him bem A few moments later he had come back, and there was something in his hand, of all things it was a crystal.

"I have had this thing for a while now, and I know that it's special, but I don't really know how to use it. I tell you what, let's strike some type of deal, you help me find a use for this crystal, and allow me to keep it, and then I'll help you.

"I should at least get something out of all this, right?"

The crystal that was in Russ's possession was the god slayer crystal that had been dropped by the Dalki Pine.
