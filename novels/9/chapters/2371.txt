'Kill Immortui,' The three Skully's had heard the words loud and clear. To them though, it was a saying that they had heard multiple times. After all, a high number of them hated Immortui because he had made their nightmare of a life even more hellish than it was before.

So they often heard a number of people say these words, but when saying them, there was a hint of fear in their voice, yet this stranger of all things had said it without any fear at all. 

Quinn looked at the ground, and started to observe the hard red shards that had come flying their way. It almost looked like feathers yet they shined like red crystals. It was something he hadn't seen before, and there was no way for him to tell how hard the substance was.

That was until another wave of the sharp red crystals fired out towards them. Rather than from just straight ahead though, they came from three directions. Ekeke bent down, allowing them to go over his head, but due to the position they were in, it meant the red shards would just hit Tuni from behind. 

However, Tuni seemed to have eyes at the back of his head as he turned and used his forearms to cover his head and bending in his body so it would cover his chest as well. The sharp red shards went straight into the hardened parts on his body, slicing through part of the bone and sticking there like darts on a dart board. 

Anon was a little more skillful than the others and also produced the strange white bone from his forearms, but hit the red shards in such a way that they were knocked off to the side, hitting the thick branch that all of them were on. 

Finally though, there was a third set of shards, and these ones went straight towards Quinn. 

'The shards come out fast like bullets, but honestly this is not a speed that I have to worry about.'

With his hands, Quinn was grabbing them out of the air, then when taking all of the velocity out of the shards, he would just drop them onto the floor, he continued to do this until he grabbed onto the very last shard, holding it in place and looking directly at it.

Anon and the others didn't have time to see this, they were far too concerned with their own safety. Seeing how many sets of shards that came out, they could guess how many demons there were around them. 

'Three Demons!' Anon thought, carefully looking ahead. He was still unable to see them, but knew they were there due to the attacks that had been made. 'It would have been hard with just one, maybe we could have done something with 2, but 3 is a lost cause… but I shouldn't give up.' 

"The moment we see one of them, all three of us should charge in. Quinn!" Anon called out. "If you can, support us from behind as much as you can with any type of power you have." 

The reason why Anon had given these orders to Quinn was because there was a double meaning behind his words. If he saw it was hopeless then he didn't mind if he chose to run away. At the end of the day, the objective of the hunt was to not be caught by the demons. 

The whole thick large branch that they were on shook as something heavy landed on it, and soon out of the darkness something could be seen straight ahead. The first thing that came out from the darkness was a large foot. 

It was thick and muscular but quite short in size, the calf was relatively small compared to the thigh muscle, and the same type of red shards that had been shot at them could be seen on the leg itself. Then its upper body came into view. It was a large and thick torso, making the creature almost look like it had a turtle shell on its back. 

However, on its back, as well as its shoulders, it was nothing but the thick hard red crystals that they had fired out. Finally, its face looked like that of a wolf, as it stuck out and had a large snout, with a single large red crystal coming out from the tip of its nose and curling backwards. 

"Attack!" Anon shouted as he charged forward and all the others followed from behind.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

'He told me, that I have to just support them from behind right?' Quinn's eyes started to glow red. 'I know who my enemy is…  so I will do just that, and support them from behind.' 

Raising up behind, Quinn had multiple blood swords that were floating in the air, condensed into a purer form, refined with his stage three Qi, and would be enhanced with his blood control. 

They were hurled out, and all of the blood swords went flying past Anon and the others. They were only able to glance at the blood swords going past their head before they went straight for the red crystal creature. 

Seeing this, the red crystal creature turned its back, almost trying to use its shell to block and defend. The swords crashed and slashed right into the shell, cutting off large chunks of the crystal, breaking them off from its body. 

It screamed in pain and grunted as it felt all of this. 

'Oh, so the blood sword's were unable to pierce its body. I guess these demons are a little stronger than I thought.' 

However, it didn't matter due to the sheer number of blood swords that went out. They swirled around to the front, and went right through the soft part of its body, piercing through the front, and slicing right through its head. 

Anon, Tuni and Ekeke stopped in their tracks as they saw one of the fearsome demons just die like that, straight in front of them, pierced with several blood swords that just evaporated into thin air. 

'I have to continue giving support.' Quinn turned his head to where one of the attacks had come from before, the end of his gauntlet lit up slightly, before he threw out a fist of blood aura. 

All the others saw was the end result, his fist in the air, and only a blur of energy coming out of the other end. 

[Blood forest fist has hit.]

[Blood has been absorbed]

[A new demon race has been discovered]

[Durum Demon]

[The blood absorbed is not of a high enough level to evolve blood aura]

[Lesser demon]

Using the blood forest fist, he could tell he was on the right path, and had discovered another one of the demon types. Fortunately enough, the single punch of his from the distance was enough to finish it off since it had hit it right on its head. 

Quinn smiled as he looked at the other two. 

"Sorry, I'll be right back, it appears one of them has run off." 

After finishing his sentence, they no longer could see Quinn, he was no longer in front of them, and as they looked left and right, they were unable to detect where he was. 

'Did he teleport… no, I saw he moved, does that mean he slowed down for us?'

Several thoughts were going through their heads, but it was all happening too fast, and before they knew it, Quinn had returned right in front of them. He slammed the head of the Durum Demon right into the tree bark. 

Its body was bloody, one of its arms was missing, and it looked to be in no condition to fight. 

"I have one question to ask you, tell me where is Immortui? If you say anything else other than the answer to my question, I'll kill you." Quinn said, pushing up hard, he was using the influence skill as well, although he doubted it would work and it seemed like it hadn't. 

"Haha, you fo-"

Before the demon could finish his sentence, with a swipe of Quinn's hand he had slit the Durum Demon's head right off. It rolled to the side of the thick tree branch and fell off onto the floor. 

'Against the demons and Immortui I won't hold back, he's been doing the same against me, so I need to do the same against him.'
