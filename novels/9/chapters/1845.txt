Chapter 1846: Turn around.

Although the sit-in was already tense, the moment Chris stepped into the room, it felt like the air had just gotten heavier. Sitting across from the rest of the group, Chris smiled at each of them.

Seeing Chris, the most unconcerned was Muka. She was more worried about the blood that was in front of her. Lifting the glass, she smelt it again and wondered why it felt so strange.

"What are these people planning?"

In truth, she would have liked to taste the blood, but not on herself in case it caused problems. This moment reminded her of the Dalki blood. It took years before the vampires learned that the Dalki blood was beneficial for them.

"What did you put in this?" Muka eventually asked. "Were you trying to... make us sick?"

"I am sorry about the blood, Chris replied calmly, "I'm not really sure what is suited to a vampire's taste. And, you see, we don't really have many of them around here."

"I thought that blood from a strong person would be more beneficial to you all, and what better person than myself? Also, I don't want to cause problems for the people in Pure. So rather than asking, I volunteered myself, just as a leader would do."

Muka pushed the glass away, and everyone else did the same, following her lead.

"We have come to make an apology on behalf of Logan Green." Muka started the conversation and came directly to the objective without beating around the bush. "Since it is an important matter, we would like to know if Zero himself is coming?"

Although Muka asked this, the situation currently was actually a better one for them. They had no clue what Zero was like or what his reaction would be. According to what they knew, the best way to find the answers they wanted was through Chris.

"It's a shame Quinn isn't here" Chris replied. "I would have really liked to have talked with him again."

The others were surprised by these words, and at the end, Chris pulled a light smile as he continued. "I'm afraid Zero won't be here. He apologizes but feel free to say what you wish."

Muka cleared her throat before she began.

"I have come here to make a report. The Red Vampires, including their Leader Laxmus, had attacked Green City."

"We saw an opportunity to track them down and follow them and also attempted to inform Pure while also pursuing Laxmus."

"In the end, a scuffle had occurred between Jake Green, the dhampirs and the Red vampires, but unfortunately, we could not retrieve the red heart from him."

It was a short message, but now the ball was in Pure's court for what they were to do.

"Tried to inform us?" Agent 13 laughed.

"Is that your excuse? We don't live in the past, and sending a message or even leaving one is quite easy. Pure and the Green family agreed to eliminate the threat and share information, and you deliberately obstructed the from us."

"It was clear that if you did get the red heart, you were planning to keep it for yourselves. Who knows, you might be lying to us now and have already gained the red heart."

Lucia was finding it hard to hold her mouth and decided to speak.

"Wasn't your group also working with the Dhampirs? They were at the Red vampires' base even before us!"

"You're correct." Chris interrupted.

"However, there was a meeting that included Jake Green, giving permission to the Dhampirs to attack the Red vampires. This information wasn't withheld from you, unlike the news of Red Heart."

"You also failed in stopping Laxmus from getting the Red Heart."

"And so did you." Muka replied.

"Like you just said, it was a joint venture, so if the Red Heart wasn't found by one of us, but by Laxmus, doesn't that mean we're both at fault?"

As well as her appearance, Muka had a soft angelic voice that seemed to calm and ease situations and tensions. It looked to be working, although it was uncertain how well it worked with Chris.

"Let me ask you all a question," Chris said as he leaned forward and placed both arms on the table.

"I want to answer honestly, Why are you here? And I don't mean what you are looking to get out of this conversation, but what situation has brought you here to sit opposite me."

There was a silence at the table for a while, and then everyone answered simultaneously, giving a jumble of answers.

"For Green City!"

"The 'Graylash' family."

"For Quinn."

"For Quinn."

"For Quinn." Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

"For Quinn."

Chris had a large smile on his face once again.

"Good, good, good. I like most of your answers, 13, 15 and all the waiters, you may leave the room."

Agents 13 and 15 raised their eyebrows in surprise, but the order from One was absolute, and they soon got up to leave.

"Make sure no one comes inside here either until I'm done," Chris added.

Jessica and Lucia gulped, thinking that there could be a fight on their hands after everyone left. They were nervous, but with Lucia next to Peter, she was less worried than she would surely have been.

When everyone left, Chris moved from his seat, and everyone chucked a little bit. But Chris didn't attack them and instead started to walk, turning his back towards them as he looked out into the sea.

"I really do like Quinn, and it's a shame he is not here with you all. Otherwise, I think this whole conversation would have gone a lot easier."

"Do you know there was a time when we both trained together? In some ways, I guess you could say he was my pupil." Chris chuckled.

Shaking their heads at this fact, they had already gotten used to Quinn knowing nearly every influential and large figure of the current world powers.

"The fact that Quinn isn't here, I will assume that he didn't want to fight. That man, although he seems calm, if he really wanted something, he wouldn't have been afraid to take on the whole ship for his goal.

"So tell me, why did he send you here?"

The others were wondering whether or not this was the right time for them to ask the question. Yet, Muka felt it was strange for Chris to send the others away. Was it because this was all a trap, or perhaps something else?

"We wish to find out what happened to Leo?" Muka answered. "I'm sure you know the Dhampir Leader Erin was once a friend of Quinn's and a pupil of Leo."

"We believe everything started to change after the latter's death. We want to understand what is going on and help Quinn so he doesn't have to lose any more people. Quinn said you saw what happened to Leo," Peter added.

"This isn't anything to do with Pure. So we hope you can tell us."

Turning around, Chris let out a big sigh.

"I'm afraid you are wrong because this has more to do with Pure than you know. I'm incredibly sorry about Leo's loss; I truly am. Because you see, before he died, the two of us had become friends."

They were wondering if Chris was lying about this fact, but many of them, for one, had no clue who Leo was or weren't around during the time. One thing was for sure, though, that Chris wasn't threatening them at all.

He was showing no aggression or even had his Qi aura restrained. It was as if he wanted to be as open as possible.

"I will tell you about what happened to Leo, but unfortunately, I think it won't help you understand the Dhampir Queen at all, even if I don't understand it, but before that."

"I want to ask you for something and I need you to guarantee it. Your cooperation."

"Cooperation?" Muka frowned.

Chris exhaled deep and said, "I want to work with your group and Quinn to bring Zero down."
