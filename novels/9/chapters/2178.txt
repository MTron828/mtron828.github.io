At first, travelling using the celestial energy felt strange for Quinn. It wasn't like using the teleporters, it was almost as if his whole body was being dragged against his will.

He remembered his time during a celestial, depending on his level, that he too would have been able to do something like this, but alas, although he did reach the higher levels, since he was trapped he never got to experience the full capabilities of what it was like to be a celestial.

'It does make me wonder though, is there a way to counter this ability? There has to be, the last god slayer had come up with a way to counter the Celestial energy completely so there has to be a way.

'Otherwise, if I ever did get on the celestial's bad side, couldn't they just teleport me some place far away? Just like Bliss did. Then I would just be transported again and again, and away from the people I want to protect.'

There was one thought that maybe his Shadow ability could do something about it. After all, when being transported he didn't usually use any of his powers in case it did interfere.

With the white light fading, the image of the planet they were on was starting to become clearer.

He wondered what planet, what opponent he would go up against next, and whether or not he would have to use the tricks, he still had up his sleeve, even if he didn't, it was still something that he wanted to try out as there wouldn't be more or better opportunities than this.

'The land, it's hard and dry.' Quinn kicked the floor a few times. 'It's hot as well, but at least it's not as hot as the Phoenix planet we were on.'

When looking around more at the area around them, Quinn was starting to notice that it looked very similar to the phoenix planet that they were on.

"Feels familiar? That's because we are on the Phoenix planet." Mundus stated as he could see the other person was confused. "I thought I should take us to a planet where there are no others, no lives, no gods watching us, so we could have a nice little chat."

In his thoughts, Quinn had almost forgotten that he had angered Mundus somewhat. To be honest, he did have the right to be annoyed but Quinn still stood by what he had done, because he too had a right to be annoyed based on what had happened in the past.

"Do you want to fight me...try to kill me?" Quinn asked, summoning his shadow body, so Mundus was unable to use his powers.

"Calm down." Mundus said. "I have no wish to fight. If I wanted to do anything I would have left you on that last planet and just left myself.

"We need to talk about the deal we made due to the sticky situation I was in."

Quinn thought the deal was quite simple, so why would there be any need to talk about it, but he let Mundus go on, since he was happy that the two of them didn't have to fight.

Quinn was still unsure about the Celestials strength even if he did have a counter.

"I am happy to comply with the deal. I am a celestial of my word, and I have always stated that a Celestial's word is important." Mundus said.

"We have to keep our promises, so that way the Celestials have order amongst themselves. Otherwise no one can trust anything.

"However, that means I do have to make one thing clear, and that is the fact that the deal me and you made is between me and you.

"I will allow you to keep the armour, but I have to warn you, that if the Ancient ones found out about this, they would never accept such a thing. So when you have this armour of yours, it is best that you do everything in your power to hide it from other Celestials.

"The Ancient ones are aware that I wish to make you an agent, but they are unaware of what we are doing now, and we need to keep it that way.

"If somehow they do find out, then I will claim no part in this at all."

The more Quinn hung out with Mundus so to speak, the more rational he found him. The celestial weren't always on his side but he was one that did his duty, and seemed to be the most fair.

Still, there had to be a reason Mundus was scared of the Ancient ones finding out. They had to have a power that was beyond even his, and apparently Immortui also had power that made the Ancient ones scared.

"I understand, this works well for both me and you, so then I have a request to make." Quinn wanted to take advantage of the tense situation a little bit more.

"You have to have your reasons for worrying about the ancient ones, and you seem confident that if they did find out about the armour, that they wouldn't trace it back to you.

"So I ask you for a favour, in these two upcoming battles, whatever power I show, you keep to yourself as well.

"I know you are the messenger and have to report to them everything, but there is something I noticed with the God Slayers that we fought against, especially the first one.

"The reason why he was on a hit list, it wasn't because he was evil and taking lives. I doubt that when it comes to the wider majority, but it's because the Ancient ones were worried.

"If they find out about the armour, if they find out about my other powers, then it is very likely they will ask for the hit to be taken on me.

"If that does happen in the future, I will not blame you, I just wish that you aren't the one that is the cause of it. After all, I saved your life back there."

Mundus wanted to stomp his feet on the ground, but he thought that it would be quite childish of himself to do so, so he restrained himself.

Every time he thought back to what had just happened he wanted to punish himself for getting caught.

Never had he been in such a vulnerable position before, it was an embarrassment and in some ways, he just wanted Quinn to never mention what happened again.

"Fine, I agree, and it seems you have caught on quickly. As I said before I am one that always keeps my promises, but as for the Ancient ones, they never make any promises so if I have one word of advice. Don't get their attention."

Mundus said these words knowing full well Quinn had already somewhat got their attention. There were hundreds of thousands of celestials and god slayers yet Quinn had stood out among them.

"Alright, I'll take you to the real place now." Mundus said. "This one, is one that you will really need."
