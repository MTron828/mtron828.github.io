When the others had gone to rescue Sil, it left Wince alone in charge of the alliance of races. She was in charge of the army and what would go on between all three planets. Because of this, she took more of a back role as she coordinated things between others.

She had to give orders of attack and retreat while also reassuring them all that their plan was working and it would be okay. However, there was a major problem. The whole reason why the other group were now able to go and attempt to rescue Sil, was because now there was a strong force on the planet.

Stark had given one last report before leaving, stating that he had seen a group of six Dalki that had more spikes than any others. Five of them with five spikes, and the one in the centre with 7 Spikes. According to some of the information they had, this Dalki was named Pike and was one of the major threats that Jack had by his side.

Knowing this, the group had left to rescue Sil, but it also meant that Wince had to create a plan and act somehow.

"Has anyone approached the Dalki yet, or have they made a move?" Wince asked, still towards the centre of the city where their base was.

"The Dalki and humans are yet to move forward ma'am, we have called all of the groups to advise them to wait before they engage‚Ä¶ what would you like us to do?" The man asked back.

It was a tough decision to make, should they try and attempt to jump the gun and attempt to attack the newcomers. While they weren't prepared, it would give them an advantage. At the same time, buying time was what they needed to do as well.

"Stick to what we have been doing so far. The Penswi will continue to scout the situation. If they try break through then the Amra will engage while receiving back up from the Mermerials." Wince ordered.

She had seen first hand how dangerous the Dalki were, and the difference between a three Spike and Four Spike, but what she was unaware of were two things, the jump from a fourth Spike and a fifth Spike and the continued jump in strength from there.

‚Äî‚Äî

"I can see why you are having trouble." Pike said as he looked at the injured around them. One group was trying to push forward and chase after the Penswi, but when they went to get close, the Mermerials would attack with their water powers and move. If they moved even further, then the strong Amra that had strength and speed and that equal to most of the Dalki would attack, causing them to essentially lose the battle.

"The purple men are too fast for most of us to catch. Even if we have equal speed they can use the alleyways and buildings to get away. We are fighting on their planet and they have a good set up." Pike mentioned.

"Get everyone to retreat and stay in one area behind me."

The order was given, and many of them thought it was a strange order. The Penswi could see that the attackers were moving back, and they were giving up the territory they had worked so hard to gain.

In some ways, some of them thought it was a sign of victory that they had done well enough to push the Dalki back. However, Wince wasn't so sure.

'Why would they send reinforcements and then make a decision like this?' There was a big worry in her mind, but the Penswi were fast so they were unlikely to get hurt.

Finally, all the attacking Dalki, and humans had gathered, numbering a force of a few thousand, but they were all standing in one area, as Pike walked out in front.

"These buildings are what are giving us trouble, so let's get rid of them." Pike got into almost a squatting position as he had his hands held down by his side.

The humans that were there,l knew what they needed to do, and they started to use their abilities and and their powers and fired them towards Pike, or more accurately, all of the attacks were directed to his hands.

The abilities and power were swirling towards them and were almost disappearing. Of course, powers couldn't just disappear and this was because the power of the attacks were being absorbed right into Pike's body. There was almost a rainbow-like glow that was covering both of his hands.

He placed both of them on the floor, and the energy shot out into the ground like a pulse. A wave of dust, followed by the rainbow-like power went through the entire city. As it hit the buildings, they were being destroyed, crumbling and falling to the ground.

Unlike the buildings of earth, the Amra buildings were made with strong materials, ones that were heavy and withstood the gravity of the Amra, yet they were all crumbling like nothing.

There were Mermerials and Amra that were on the roofs of the buildings or that were inside, and they had to rush to get out before they were crushed by the building rocks.

"Now that should make it much easier, everyone attack!" Pike ordered.

Hearing this, the others rushed out from their positions in all directions. The buildings and wave of attack were still going through the city, and now they needed to deal with the Dalki and humans as well.

Pike started to move forward, as the fighting around him started and in doing so the five spike's had followed him. When he entered the fighting that was going on in the city, a stray water attack from the Mermerial was aimed towards him, lifting his hand up, the attack seemed to be absorbed into his hand once again.

Throwing his hand out, the attack came out as a burst of rainbow-like energy and it was several times more powerful. The water attack hit the Mermerial, making its entire body disappear.

Next, an Amra had come running towards Pike with its four large fists, and in a blur Pike had lifted his large foot and kicked it in the stomach making it completely disappear out of his sight. No one even knew what happened to the Amra because he wasn't there anymore.

The five spike Dalki behind him were similarly dealing with anything that came their way almost just as easily. At times there would be a stronger Amra that would take a few hits but not too much more.

‚Äî‚Äî

Back at the base of the alliance, Wince was getting up off the floor, their whole set up and the building they were using had been destroyed. When she finally was coming to with the others, the Penswi had come back with a report.

"You're telling me that what just happened, all of it was caused just by one Dalki?" Wince repeated, after hearing the information. She thought about what would happen if she was to go up against a person like that, how long would she be able to last, perhaps a few seconds.

The rest of her army, how long would they last, a minute at most. At that point and time Wince felt hopeless.

"I suggest, you and the Blades leave this planet!" One of the older Mermerials stated. "I know you do not wish to abandon the people here, but we can not escape with you. You, as well as the Blades, are the hope for this army at the moment.

"If you live, you will still give hope to the other planets, but if you die then the morale of the entire force will go down. Morale is a strong thing. Although these enemies are strong, there are only a few. The rest of the army will need you in order to defeat the others."

Wince was biting hard on her back teeth, she almost didn't want to hear the old man's words, but knew he was right, because she had the same thoughts as well.

"Please leave, for the sake of the entire alliance army."

Pike was still heading forward towards the alliance base taking out whatever came toward him, and that's when he could see a ship leaving the planet.

"Running away‚Ä¶ you will only be escaping the inevitable. No matter where you go, at some point you will have to face me.

"Let's speed this up, and get rid of the rest of these!" Pike ordered.
