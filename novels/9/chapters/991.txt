Chapter 992 - A touching leader

The class was busier than ever today. It was no surprise as there was double the number of people present in today’s lesson. Trying to rack his head for helping his students, Quinn had come up with a solution. It was impossible for him to teach them all personally one by one in such a short amount of time.

This was often a problem when teaching a large group. Different people learnt in different ways and at different speeds. He would need to decide whether to just move on and forget about those that didn’t understand or focus on the talented students.

If he did that, it would just be him going against everything he was working so hard for. Instead, Quinn asked Sam for a favour this time, to send over the best beast weapon users that the Cursed faction had.

Surprisingly, or rather unsurprisingly at this point, Sam had gone beyond what Quinn had expected him to do. There were more than just those on the Cursed ship that was part of the Cursed faction. A message was sent out that their leader was asking for the best of the best beast weapon users across all of the factions that were under the Cursed group.

This was their answer, and there were more than enough teachers for every student. They were versatile when it came to teaching. More importantly, they could teach students about their weapons that Quinn had no idea about.

’Things are going well. Some of them are even better at explaining how to activate the beast weapons than I am.’ Quinn thought.

’That is a given. What works for one person may not work for another. With the number of people you have brought, every experienced person is able to share their knowledge. I am quite surprised that you came up with this plan yourself.’ Vincent replied.

Quinn was quite pleased, he wasn’t sure this was enough, but at least the students seemed to be having a good time.

In the corner of the room, Quinn walked up to Shiro, who was there waiting with his duel blades in his hands.

"Alright, should we continue with what I was teaching you before then?" Said Quinn.

———-

The day had ended, and there were still two more days until the beast weapons class event would start. There had already been a few events that others could watch, and points to the houses had been applied.

The students now had a general idea of how events would work and play out.

However, it was almost impossible to hide a hundred and fifty people that had come over to help out the Cursed faction. Complaints had started, with one of them being Aden. He had kept an eye on the class and had heard what general Hardy had done.

"This is unfair!" Aden complained. "My students haven’t had professional help and personal tutoring from others. It’s clear that General Hardy is just doing this before the competition to give his students an unfair advantage. You have to speak to the supreme commander about this."

General Sach, was relaxing in his own office. He was twiddling with a toothpick in his mouth, trying to control the split part of his tongue, and soon broke the toothpick in half.

"Oscar won’t do anything. It seems he already received permission beforehand. Oscar claimed that it was something that we could have done to help our students at any time as well and thought it was actually a good idea. Remember, we are not attempting to fight against each other. This event is just in good spirits for the students.

"Are you really that worried that your students will lose?" Sach asked. "Skills take years to learn. There won’t be much that they can learn in just a couple of days. I would know better than most."

They weren’t the only people displeased with what was happening either, as the students from the other classes felt it was unfair. All of their complaints had fallen upon Aden’s ears.

"Teacher, can’t you do something like that for us, invite some of the strong ones from the military?"

"Yeah, aren’t you some respected sergeant like you keep telling us? You should know some people, right?"

However, it was harder than one thought to just invite people. Even people in factions, those in the military, they all had important jobs to do. The only thing Aden could think of was to try and hire some people from a faction linked to the Earthborn group. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, to hire a personal tutor for each student would cost a fortune and would just be a waste. He couldn’t even imagine how much Head general Hardy was paying those people who missed out on two days hunting.

’There are probably just some F and D rank Travelers from the factions.’ He thought.

"Don’t worry about anything," Aden said. "The reason why they need to do this in the first place is because of how bad they are. You guys will win this with ease. You can even ask Zhen and the others. they saw what they were like."

Zhen nodded confidently. Teacher Aden never heard about what he had done. Quinn didn’t bother to report it, for he and Shiro were planning their own personal revenge.

———

It was the last day before the event, and Quinn could see that everyone had improved by leaps and bounds. Having a personal tutor was like a shortcut. Making sure the students didn’t make the same mistakes they did when they were younger.

The most important thing was that they were all experienced fighters teaching them fundamental ways of fighting.

"Are you sure what you’ve taught me is enough for me to beat an ability user and one for the top ones as well?" Shiro asked, losing a bit of self-confidence as the days leading up to the event were upon them.

"Of course, I can’t guarantee you will win," Quinn replied. "But that is the same if you had any other ability. Just because you have a strong ability doesn’t guarantee one to be better than others, but what I have taught you is something that can match against any top ability users. You want to make an impression and prove everyone wrong, right? Then what better way than to beat one of those high ranking ability users without an ability at all.

"Let’s show the whole school that they are wrong to look down on those with no ability," Quinn said with a smile.

With the final day of training done, Quinn had all the students thank everyone for their hard work. After all, they couldn’t stay teaching the students forever, but it was a great start. The tips they learnt today would help them grow in the future, and now not a single student didn’t know how to activate a beast weapon.

Once all the student’s left, Quinn also didn’t forget to thank everyone in his faction as well.

"All of you have helped me when asked, and I don’t want you guys to think that I have done this without paying any of you a favour back," Quinn said. "If any of you ever need help in the future, please don’t be shy to ask. I can’t help if I don’t know what the problem is."

Those who didn’t know Quinn that well and were from the other factions were starting to respect him more, not just because of what he had just said but because of the actions he had taken. Some of them thought they were being tasked with taking on a strong demon tier beast. Sam had even agreed to compensate them as if they were doing so with credits and beast crystals.

When they learnt what they were actually doing, they wondered what leader or person would take their time to personally do such a thing. Quinn was on top of the world, and he was here teaching students personally. Something about that touched them more than the leaders who just ordered others to do their bidding.

When returning, Quinn had received a request and learnt of a few details about tomorrow’s event. He was to select five of his top students and then one at a time, they would battle it out in a three-way duel. Fighting against the beast class from the Graylash family, and from the Earthborn group.

There would be refs on the side, wearing top beast gear and with the speed ability. They were to stop any serious injuries that were to happen to the students. If a ref was to stop the match, they would then declare the winner and why the match had been stopped. Strikes to the heads were not allowed.

’Five people, it reminds me of the duels we had when I got my seat of power. Tomorrow is going to be an exciting day.’ Quinn thought.

Finally, the day was upon them, the beast weapons class event would be starting.
