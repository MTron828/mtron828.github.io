In the tower, the heat of the forging room was almost unbearable. The forge itself was placed in a particular place that allowed it to reach certain heats needed to melt down the materials to make their special weapons.

However, at the moment, not only was it unnaturally hot inside because of this, but also due to the work that was being done. No one had rested so far as they continued to make the weapons. The heat from all of their bodies was adding to the room.

At the same time, whenever Quinn was working, this pressure would come off from his body. It was swirling around in the air, adding to the already tense situation. For some reason, for a while now, all of the Amra, including Dober, could feel that the swirling energy had gotten more intense.

The Amra had already done all they needed to do, but they stood a distance away, watching Quinn. He continued to hammer away at the final bits, changing the tools needed as he focused on different areas.

'I can't think about what is happening right now, I can't think about it,' Quinn thought as he continued to hammer in the same spot. 'I just have to follow the instructions he gave me. I have to do as he told me and focus on one thing.'Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Alex had given Quinn a set of instructions on how to make the ultimate pair of gauntlets that could be used to fight. Those instructions included melting down the Celestial blood guns. They had their use when fighting against the demons and other opponents from far away, but the opponents he was going up against now needed all of Quinn's strength combined into one hit. This was the best option.

In the end, Quinn had gone through with what Alex had said. His final plea was too strong. He couldn't go against him, and the blood guns had been melted down. They had already been combined with all the materials needed, and now, the last few finishing touches were being done on the two gauntlets.

Although his mind was focused on the task, it was as if his body was reacting to his strong emotions. His feelings were pouring out through his aura and affecting everyone around him. That was because Quinn could no longer hear Alex. Granted, he was no longer holding onto the blood weapons, which might have been a reason, and he wasn't wearing the gauntlets either. But not hearing Alex's voice after the melting of the guns had hit him.

It was the first time in the whole process where he had taken a moment before proceeding further.

"Your task is done," Quinn said.

The Amra looked up, surprised to hear him speak. He hadn't said much to any of them.

"You have already done everything you can. There is nothing else you can help with. I know you are all worried, but worrying will do nothing. The best thing you can do is go out there and see the situation and if you can help them.

"I am sure there will be equipment that needs repairing, ships that need fixing, and those that could use your strong muscles and determination that helps you with forging to fight.

"I promise I will finish this, and I will do everything I can to save your planet, but to do that, there needs to be a planet left for saving."

The Amra looked at each other, concerned. Most of their family were in the tower as well, but it was natural that a good forger was a good fighter as well. So they felt guilty by being inside.

"We will head off," Dober said with a bow. "And we hope we get to see just what you can do to punish the attackers with the armour we helped create."

———

On the Marpo Cruise, where Jack was currently in charge, for a while now, the whole place had been in chaos. There was a large number of androids stationed inside, and they were attacking all over the place.

It wasn't just one area of the cruise ship that was being targeted, but multiple. It was so bad that it got to the point where H and Jack himself had to go around exterminating many of the androids. This was also part of the reason why they were unable to get updates on the situation below. The target of the androids were communication devices, among other things.

However, something had soon changed as all of the androids had suddenly stopped. The situation had calmed down, and they were no longer on the move. Finally, there was some sort of peace onboard the Marpo Cruise, but things were still hectic. The engineers were now in full swing, trying their best to repair the damage that was done.

At the same time, the Dalki that were still on board were told to destroy any of the remaining androids as they wanted to make sure that the same thing wasn't going to happen again.

As for why the androids had suddenly stopped, it was all due to the situation down below. Logan had been controlling the androids to do as he ordered. However, in order for nothing to crop up, or for others with skills similar to his or engineering skills to override his control, he was in constant control of the androids. He also did this to make sure that only the appropriate tasks were done, and that no one who didn't need to be injured wasn't injured. Which was why, as soon as his powers had faded, so did his fine-tuning commands.

However, those onboard weren't aware of this, so they were still wasting their time, trying to get rid of them all.

"That damned Logan betrayed us, and we still have no clue about the situation on any of the planets?" Jack asked.

The men were panicked and didn't want to give him an answer that they knew he wouldn't like. So they continued to work away.

'Damn it!' Jack clenched his fist. 'I saw some of the situation, Pine seemed to be doing well, and then moved to the other planet. Things should be okay, but we still have no idea where exactly Sil is.

'At the same time, because they broke our long-distance communication device, I can't get an update on the situation with Jim either. To be honest, I'm surprised he hasn't finished the task already and come back. This means he must be experiencing some trouble as well. It's unlikely he is behind this.'

"Sir!" one of the men shouted. "We finally have a visual of the situation on one of the planets. We should be receiving information soon about the reports."

When the camera feed came in, Jack could see it all. The people that were going against Pine: humans, those with vampire powers, and the Blades. Those that had originally ruined his life.

Based on the description he had heard from H, it sounded like these were the people that he had confronted before taking Sil. The vein on Jack's head was starting to bulge even more, to the point it looked like it was going to pop, but the anger soon turned into a smile.

"I knew the Blades had escaped somewhere, I think they had a hand in all of this. I should have known," Jack laughed. "The fact that Sil is still nowhere to be seen must mean he is still sleeping.

"Although there is one surprise, I'm surprised that Pine and the other Dalki haven't been able to deal with them."

"Sir, we just got a report from below." The man swallowed his saliva before speaking. "Two of the five Spikes have been defeated, and the others seem to be heavily injured and aren't faring so well."

Jack took a deep breath as he had made a decision after hearing this news.

"This is fine, tell H to get there immediately, and to get rid of everyone."
