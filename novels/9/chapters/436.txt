Following Peter’s presence, the whole way up till the castle was quite easy for Quinn. Travelling from the forest, he had entered the settlement with no problems. not a single person had stopped him to ask what he was doing there, even while continuing to wear the mask to cover his face. If Peter had been caught and had disguised himself as Quinn at the time. Then it meant that there might be quite a few vampires that recognised him. As he walked through the city, not a single Vampire batted an eyelid as he walked past.

He wanted to explore, and see what the vampire place was like, but the connection he currently had with Peter was continuing to sway in and out, and there was a good chance that it might disappear completely. Feeling the strange feeling coming and going, Quinn feared the worse that perhaps Peter was dying. So instead of taking his time exploring the vampire settlement, he decided to start rushing his way forward.

The strange energy was coming from the thirteenth castle, which was stationed to the very right. All of the castles surrounded the city in a semicircle like shape and the thirteenth was at the very end. Most of the city was easy to get through, but then he noticed that there was a strange wall in between the castle area and the city. A gate of some type.

This gate was the separation between those that worked directly for a vampire family, and those that lived with everyone else under some type of family. Carefully looking at the gate, Quinn noticed that there were guards stationed at these sections, and it would seem as if vampires who entered and exited needed to show something to enter.

While thinking of what to do next, the system decided to chime in and help him.

"The more you start to explore and roam around the city, the more I’m starting to think this is exactly the same settlement that I used to live in." The system said. "I don’t know if an exact replica was made or if they really had managed to transport it all over to another planet somehow."

At first, Quinn didn’t quite understand why the system was suddenly being nostalgic out loud, while he was desperately trying to find a way in but as it continued to speak, he realized it wasn’t just nonsense and he actually had a plan.

"Well, if this place is really exactly the same as the last, then I think I might have a way to get to the thirteen castles."

Following the system’s instructions, he was able to direct Quinn to a strange location. It was still near the thirteenth castle, but not past the wall they had put up to segregate the different sections. They had entered what looked like a strange small garden that was surrounded by several walls. There seemed to be no such visitors, but it made sense since there seemed to be nothing in the area either. There were no benches to look at, and only a few followers here or there.

However, there were still people walking past in the street that was right next to the garden.

"It should be right here." The system said.

The two of them had reached what could only be described as, as a wall. However, the wall did have quite the interesting design on it. It had a large circle with several other smaller circles inside and one was able to twist and turn each different part of the section.

"It’s a lock, and unfortunately, this is as far as I can take you. This is a secret entrance that should lead you to the underground tunnels. There are several put all over the city in case of a type of an attack of some sort. Allowing people to move from one location to the next without having to go through all the different buildings." The system started to explain.

"Then, if you don’t know the combination, then what much help is this?" Quinn replied.

"You should start to know your own system better than that. It has managed to help you in tricky situations, before, and I think this time will be no different." The system said, but decided to keep the next part to himself. ’The one who created these lock systems in the first place is the same as the one who made the system. So I’m almost certain you will be able to unlock it."

Pressing his hand up against the strange circular lock and then using his inspect skill, gave Quinn all the information he needed. It took a while as if the system was trying to crack some type of code, but eventually it gave instructions of what to do and how to do it. Following them, Quinn was able to turn the circle contraption in the right direction eventually hearing a clicking sound. The wheels then started to move once more and into place until the wall morphed backwards into itself, before falling to the floor. Revealing a type of hole in the wall with a staircase that leads downwards.

As soon as the door had been unlocked, Quinn could feel Peter’s connection even stronger.

"He’s down there, I have to hurry!"

Without saying anything, Quinn dashed forward as fast as he could, and the door behind started to rebuild itself on its own. Finally, although the tunnels seemed strange and hard to navigate, Quinn wasn’t trying to find his way out, or the direction of the other castles. He was just playing a game of hot and cold with himself. As he went down one tunnel, if the connection grew stronger he would continue to head that way, but if it felt weaker, he knew he was going in the wrong direction.

Finally, he had arrived, and it was in just the nick of time, as he threw his shadow outward and dashed forward, protecting Peter.

Although it had been a long time since Jin had seen the purple moving shadows. The second he saw it, he instantly knew that it was the punisher’s powers. There weren’t many alive today that would be able to recognize such an ability. Perhaps some of the leaders decided to pass down their history, while others chose to keep it a secret, which wasn’t too surprising considering what had happened in the past.

When the shadows eventually moved downward, Jin was able to clearly see the two boys in front of him, who looked to both be teenagers. This surprised Jin a bit, because when he thought of the punishers, he always thought of them as this strong force. However, it looked like what Clark had told him was the truth; it was just a young boy who had reached the stage of a vampire Noble.

Ever since Quinn had evolved, his senses were more finely tuned than before, and when looking at Jin in front of him, the hairs on his neck were starting to stand up. This was a feeling he hadn’t even felt when going up against Clark.

’He’s stronger than a vampire knight. Does that mean he’s a vampire leader, at the strength of a vampire lord?’ Quinn thought.

While thinking this, the system chimed in just to confirm it.

"Careful Quinn, that Jin talon, the fourth vampire leader. He uses the same ability as Clark himself, but I don’t think you need me to tell you that a fight with him and a fight against Jin will be two completely different things."

His thoughts were spot on and for the first time, Quinn would be going against a vampire leader, the strongest of the vampires. Looking to his right, he could see Peter there, who looked unharmed and quite powerful. He could also tell that he too had grown in strength compared to last time, and he was happy to see him healthy. But behind him, were the two lesser Wights that had made a recovery and were now by their side as well.

Quinn using his inspect skill was able to tell they belonged to Peter. Although they were now technically controlled and owned by Peter, they did not belong to the cursed family and took no extra slots.

Jin was wearing a long black overcoat and pulling the side of it towards his mouth he started to whisper.

"I found the punisher. He is with the Wight, and two other vampires seem to be under his control. They are located under the tunnels of the thirteenth, towards the main area."

Sending out this message, there was only a little amount of time before others would come running towards them as well.

"Can we do this with the four of us?" Quinn thought as he hesitated, whether to fight or run.

Using his right hand, Jin stretched out behind him and grabbed the shield. Banging on the top, several spiked blades had come out from the edge. However, this wasn’t what was surprising, it was the fact that all the spikes seemed to be covered in blood. It hadn’t come from a wound like the attacks before, but instead looked as if the blood was already pre placed in the shield.

"I won’t make the mistake of going easy on you, like Clark did." Jin said, as he got ready to throw his shield.
