Chapter 555 Against the big three!

The question was an unexpected one for Quinn. Not that he thought they would never ask it, but it was just every time in the past, as the Blood evolver or Quinn himself, the first question Nate would usually ask was,

"When can we fight?"

Honestly, he would have preferred that to be the actual question over the one asked right now. It would have been a lot easier for him to answer. Honestly, Quinn was also looking forward to a little fight after being pounded by Linda.

Both Sam and Nate could see that Quinn was hesitating. It shouldn’t have been something so hard, yet it was. Nate knew they weren’t too close, but he felt like they had a connection for a lot longer than they actually did. He had met Quinn in the game a long time ago before seeing him in real life and had been following him ever since.

"You don’t have to explain yourself if you don’t want to," Nate said. "But it will make it easier for us. In a way, we’re putting our backs on the line. Sooner or later they are going to know that we already know you. If they find out we were covering you for whatever reason, then we could get in trouble. If we understand why you’re doing this, maybe we can help you out.

"You don’t have to tell us why you have two abilities, but was wondering why you at least chose to hide them. You could have just shown one of them, right? No one else knows you’re the Blood Evolver. So I understand if you showed the Red aura skills then someone from the inter tournament recognised you as the Cursed child, it would confuse things. But then just show the shadow."

Out of the two abilities, the one Quinn couldn’t really show was the blood one. This was because it belonged to the vampires and he wasn’t the only one who could perform this. If others found out, then most likely Kazz would report him trying to use this against him.

As for the shadow ability, was it something he really needed to hide? Yes, if the military knew he was alive, they would try to recruit him because of what they had seen at the inter tournament. But if he showed his ability. He would rise up, the Graylash family would find out about it and protect him for joining them.

He didn’t have to worry, and he would complete his goal. Thinking of this scenario, Quinn didn’t want that. He didn’t want to be protected by another faction. Listening to someone else and not moving about as he wished. He had figured out his own answer through these two.

"I didn’t want to show my ability because I didn’t come here to stand out and join a faction," Quinn replied. "You see how I’m here on my own. The others went to other places to be with their families. Each one of them is under a different faction. It annoyed me that we couldn’t stay together. Just after I...." Quinn stopped himself there, as he was about to mention saving Fex from the vampire world.

Just as they had gotten back together again, they all needed to split up.

"I saw your messages, and I came here because I wanted to see you guys, to be with people I knew at least. For now, I just want to stay put until I figure things out, I don’t want to be thrown into another situation I can’t control."

It was crazy how, before when he didn’t have power, he couldn’t do as he wished. Now that he did have powers, some people would try to use his power for their own benefit.

Nate scratched his head and was pulling his face like this was a tough one for him. Sam was looking at him, wondering if he really understood Quinn’s feelings. Sam didn’t really understand them either, he couldn’t because he knew Quinn was holding back something from them.

"The way I see it," Nate said. "If you don’t really want to be part of any faction, but you want to be with your friends, right? But of course, they have to go off somewhere to feel protected." Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Quinn’s eyes opened. This was precisely the way he felt.

’Then there is a simple answer for all of this." Nate replied with a smile on his face. "Make your own faction. As long as you’re strong enough and there are people willing to follow you, that’s all you need."

"Don’t be crazy!." Sam shouted. "Do you know how much it cost to just run one of these places? First, you would need a base. Somewhere big enough to house not only your people but their families as well. Keep in mind that most planets already have several factions on them, good luck finding that. You would need the resources, the credits, the beast crystals. And you would have to recruit people to get strong enough to eventually be as big as one of the big three.

"Why do you think all the medium-sized factions joined up with the big three in the first place."

"I didn’t say it was easy," Nate replied. "I just gave him the answer."

Thinking about it, Quinn realised wasn’t this what Arthur had done. Arthur had chosen to go away from the others, from everything. He took his people away, the ones he cared about and decided to protect them.

However, there was a big difference between him and Arthur right now. Arthur had the strength to protect those around him. He could deal with the vampires and the humans.

Quinn was strong, but he wasn’t that strong.

Clenching his fist, he thought....Yet.

The one thing he had during his time on earth, was time. Time to get stronger.

And the things that Sam was talking about, didn’t Quinn have all of them? Quinn had the ship. It was able to house around 2000 people. The hardest part would be recruiting those to join, but they could always start small for starters.

He could start by inviting Logan, Vorden, and the two girls over, they could bring their family as well. Right now, everyone was in a faction. If a new force started to take away people and was beginning to come into power, one of the big three would attempt to take it down. So if he was going to go through with this, he needed to do it discreetly.

Nate and Sam continued to bicker over the crazy idea. Every time Sam would bring up a counter-argument, Nate would oversimplify it. The reason why Sam was getting so riled up was because Nate was making sense. His answers made sense, but he was thinking about the risks. From the corner of his eye, he could see a smile on Quinn’s face.

"You’re going to do it, aren’t you?" Nate asked.

The plan had stayed the same as before. First, he would lay low while he found out the everyday doings of the factions. Complete quest rank up and build the funds to purchase some necessary items for the ship. While doing this, he could complete a quest to get stronger, defeating the beast gave him tons of new exp for a level up.

Then it didn’t matter if he showed his shadow powers or not. If the Graylash family were interested in him, he could decide their and then. To join them or chose to leave at a later time, or he could decline their invitation. If they hated him for either one, tried to force him or do otherwise. Then he would take the fight to them.

"Great!" Nate said as he stood up from the table. "I knew you were different when I met you, Quinn. You’re just like me. You don’t want to rely on the powers of others you want to make your own path. While I want to have a great legacy, a great name for myself, you just want to protect those you care about.

"Now there is one thing you need to do if you want to compete with the big boys. You’re going to have to get hella strong. Come on, let’s go." Nate said, already walking off, more excited than he had ever been before.

Nate had grand ambitions, but he would never try to do something like starting his own faction. With all the troubles and possible risks, that’s something crazy people did, and Nate wasn’t crazy. But whenever he met up with Quinn, he wanted to do crazy things.

Who knows, for now, he would go along, and maybe even join this crazy ride.

"Wait, where are you going? What about the others?" Quinn asked as he could see Nate was walking in the base’s direction and not to the market.

"Sam can go get them," Nate replied. "Invite them along, you and your friends are all going to want to learn this. Because me and you, we’re going to learn how to use a soul weapon."

’Soul weapon.’

Learning a soul weapon would significantly boost one strength. Quinn had seen it when he fought against Duke, and he had seen it when he fought against Paul and his men. It was one of the weapons and strengths humans had over the vampires.

That’s right, it was something that Humans had that vampires didn’t. Although Quinn would have loved to have a soul weapon. He wasn’t even sure if he could really have one or not.

If he could, it would just give him another tool that he could use, to strengthen his power.

"Let’s go," Quinn said.
