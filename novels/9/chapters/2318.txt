Jessica had slept well that day, knowing that she was successful in keeping Earth safe for a little while longer. When she woke up, she decided to head straight into the office, even though she was meant to have a half day off today.

It wasn't as if she had anything else going on, and at least she could do some research on other cases and such. Eventually she had reached the Vampire Corps base.

It had changed from what it used to be, it was a large square building that was mainly made of glass, and recently a new statue had been put up of Quinn in front of it.

Apparently, there were statues of Quinn all over the place before, but they had been destroyed, now they were making them again even grander than before.

Walking through the front doors, Jessica had entered the large reception area. It was an area that was also used for socialising as they had drink machines on the sides, as well as seating areas.

There were also multiple desks set up, so those that wanted to come in to make a report and such would head inside. Essentially, a desk related to different types of crimes that would go out to different units, all of it in one big space. Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

Which was why she was surprised to see it rather empty, but it wasn't because it was empty, she soon realised that all of her fellow workers had gathered in one spot, they were talking quite loudly, with their voices slightly higher pitched.

'Did a celebrity visit us or something?' Jessica thought.

"Please, could you guys give me a bit of space, I'm just paying a visit to see someone." A voice said.

The crowd continued to talk, and the soft sound of the man's voice was hardly heard due to all of those talking around him.

"Everyone, the head has just ordered all of you to give him space so give him space!" An older woman shouted.

Jessica recognised that voice straight away, it was the chief of this department, Barbra. Essentially she ran the whole place.

Immediately, all of the vampires who had gathered around moved away, and respectfully gave a little bow.

"I'm sorry about that Andy." Barbra said. "These vampires haven't lived in the settlement, and they seem to lack a bit more respect."

"It's okay, I understand, it's because of me that we aren't so strict with them on that stuff in the first place." Andy smiled, and looked ahead where his eyes had met up with Jessica.

'It's Andy!' She thought. She didn't know Andy too well, but she knew that he was a friend of Quinn's. Which was why she was able to get into the Vampire Corps easily in the first place.

During her whole time here, she had only talked to him once and that was when she had tried to join.

Andy, started to walk over to her, Jessica turned her head left and right, until he had eventually stopped right in front of her.

"Just the person I was looking for." Andy smiled.

Her finger pointed at herself.

"Me!"

Everyone else was just as surprised as Jessica, why would the leader of the entire Vampire Corps unit come to see her. It would make sense if he was visiting the chief, but she was just a captain.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The two of them eventually went to an interrogation room as it was one of the few places that didn't have people around. Whatever Andy wanted to talk about, he wanted to keep it a secret from others.

"It seems you have been settling in well, you rose to the rank of captain rather quickly." Andy said.

"Yes, thank you for giving me this opportunity. It really has changed my life and I enjoy being here." Jessica replied.

"That's good to hear." Andy replied. "I would have checked up on you earlier, but after what happened‚Ä¶ Did you know, my father was about to go back into an eternal slumber, but that was after all of this mess with Quinn had happened.

"Now he's trying to get the Vampire Corps to set up systems so no one can ever forget Quinn again, separate from Logan, and one that no one can hack to delete all of our history."

It was nice to see Andy talking about his father, but Jessica was still wondering what he was doing here, but she couldn't ask, and strangely after just saying those few words it looked like he was about to leave, before he did though he turned to her one more time.

"I got a message, that we should be careful, anyone with a link to Quinn should watch out for anything strange. I know me and you aren't the best of friends, but we do have a common link." Typing away on some strange device on his forearm, Jessica's forearm lit up.

"I just gave you an open line to contact me if you ever need any help. If you even notice anything suspicious then contact me as well. I will be looking after my father, he's getting old. I know your situation, so I just want to say, that I am looking out for you as well."

With that Andy had left, causing as much commotion as he did when he arrived, but it left Jessica with a big thought on her mind, just what was going on that Andy had come to visit her.

Later on in the day, Jessica had been feeling a little lost, they were at the cafeteria enjoying some raw pieces of meat with a pouch of blood.

"What's wrong Jessica, you haven't touched your food at all?" Galanar said, sitting opposite of her.

"Nothing‚Ä¶ It's just the visit with Andy today. I'm sure you heard about it, all he said to me was be careful." Jessica commented.

"Crap‚Ä¶ does he have a thing for you as well." Galanar nearly slammed the table, but stopped himself moments before as everyone on the cafeteria table looked at him, as if he had done it a few times in the past before.

"Oh speaking of, I saw the letter you sent me, so what gift are you planning to get me to win over my heart?" Jessica asked, hoping a bit of teasing would cheer her up a bit.

"Letter, what letter?" Galanar asked.

"You know, the letter in my apartment, it was slid under my door."

"I'm sorry, but I really don't know what you're talking about."

Jessica was surprised, Galanar wasn't the type to lie and it didn't look like he was lying, but if it wasn't him, then who else could it be, there were only a few people that knew where she even lived.

In the vampire settlement, Quinn had finally received a call from Logan, and it appeared he had some good news.

"We haven't found any signs of Magnus, but we can be pretty sure that he is on Earth. We found an unregistered ship, and then when tracking it down and what type of ship it was, it appeared to have come from the Marpo Cruise. In particular it was registered to the cruise ship that Jim was on.

"I'm going through the local camera footage to try and see if I can spot anything, or the AI system can pick anything up, but I just wanted to let you know."

"Thanks for the information." Quinn said, and the call ended there.

'The vampire settlement has continued to be very quiet.' Quinn thought. 'If Magnus is on Earth, then there has to be a reason for why that is, right? The fact that nothing is happening is worrying me‚Ä¶ I think I have to go to earth.' Quinn thought.

‚Äî‚Äî

Everyone could tell that Jessica just wasn't feeling it at work that day. Since she had already come in early, when she was meant to have a half day off, they told her to take the rest of the day off.

She really didn't think that would help at all, as the work was a nice distraction from her thoughts, but she was unable to as it was orders from Barbra.

Heading home, she slowly opened the door, and felt her foot crumble against something again.

"Another letter?" She picked it up, opening it, again with a few words written.

"We will meet soon."
