Chapter 2508 A special family

The vampire settlement was recovering from the recent attack from the Divine Brigade. There had been next to no issues since the event but it was causing ripple effects throughout the vampires' society, not just at the vampire settlement.

The vampires feared that the attack might be targeted towards them, rather than the general population since it had occurred during the time all of the vampires had gathered.

In a way, the fact that all of the leaders were preparing for the worst, just made tensions for everyone else rise that much higher.

In the vampire settlement, a meeting was taking place, Layla, Xander, and Muka were the main ones that were present. They were sitting at the normal round table in the garden stationed out the back of the main castle.

"This is proving to be a bigger headache than I first thought." Muka declared, as she pressed on a small square device on the table in front of her. A projection of files opened up and everyone was able to see what she was talking about.

"The Graylash vampires, and the Vampire Corps units, have reported nearly every little thing they find suspicious, but it's almost impossible to tell if any of them are related to Immortui, or if it's a completely separate matter."

"Even out of the reports we have investigated, we still haven't been able to find anything that is related to the matter either." Xander stated.

"We can't just disregard what is happening either." Layla said, as she remembered what had occurred at the event. "If a large scale attack was to occur with whatever attacked us today, and we don't have measures to help the people, then the worse will occur."

All of them agreed with the severity of the situation, and it felt like all they could do was to just continue on doing what they had been doing this whole time. It just meant that there were more tiring days ahead of them.

"Galen stop it!" A short voice said.

Turning around they could see that a few more guests were arriving. They could see a man that had the same appearance as Quinn, and by his side, was Galen and Minny.

Galen was walking in with his hands behind his back, looking elsewhere, while Minny seemed to be filled with anger at him for some reason. Directly behind her a portal of shadow appeared, and out of it, a large hand was made from the shadow.

After creating the hand, a long dangling finger would poke Minny on her back. Immediately Minny turned around, she could only see the lingering finger of the shadow.

For a while now Galen had been using the shadow more often. People were becoming aware of what he could do, especially those in higher positions, but not only had he been using the shadow more but his control and power over it were extremely impressive and he was improving at a rapid rate.

'His shadow powers, are they growing even quicker than Quinn's?' Vincent thought, as he was observing everything for a while now. 'He hasn't even used techniques like shadow eater or anything like that. I wonder how his powers are able to grow."

Vincent had been keeping a closer eye on the two children. Since Layla was now taking up more of a role in the settlement, she didn't have a lot of time to directly look after her children. But considering how they were a main target, they needed someone to look after them.

"Mommy!" Minny said, running over and leaping up, she jumped straight into Layla's arms who had caught her. "When is Daddy going to come back? It's hard staying with grandpa all the time because he looks so much like daddy that I miss him, and Galen, he never speaks to me, everything is so boring."

Things were tough and it only made Layla's heart ache more every time Minny would ask this question. As more time went on, she had to prepare that there was the chance that perhaps he wouldn't come back.

She looked at Vincent, who just reluctantly shook his head.

"I have some good news perhaps." Vincent said. "But it might not be the best news. The passing of time is different in the space where the others had gone to. An hour passed here is a different amount of time in the other space. However, I do not know what that time is. With this news it could explain why Quinn is taking so long."

The idea was for Quinn to enter the space and deal with Immortui; that didn't happen, and then a group of their strongest had entered and had gone to deal with Immortui and still there was no news or anything different. They couldn't help but worry, as they never imagined things would take this long.

"Very well, then all we can do is for all of us to keep on trying our best." Layla declared.

With the meeting over, all of them stood up from their position and started to walk back to the settlement. It was quite often the group would make their rounds, and just make a public appearance to the general vampires to settle their worries.

As they entered the settlement and started to walk into the main living areas, they had quickly discovered that something was amiss. The air felt steady, almost not moving.

There was no sound of the wind, and when they walked forward, they finally could see the vampires of the settlement. All of them were frozen in place, not physically frozen but unmoving, and not even breathing.

"What is going on?" Xander asked.

Layla's heart sank.

"I've experienced this before, I remember, when this happened last time. Galen, Minny, hide and take cover!"

The two listened quickly, using the shadow space and getting rid of themselves, but Layla started to wonder. Why could their group still move? It must mean that whoever was coming to see them had the intention of talking to them.

Almost seeming to appear out of nowhere, the one who Layla had envisioned in her mind was standing in front of her.

"It's been a while since we have seen each other, hasn't it?" Mundus said with a smile. "Now, I have a very very important question to ask you, and it's important that you answer it honestly.

"This isn't just for your sake, but for his as well. Where is Quinn?"

All of the vampires were startled, not saying a word, so Mundus decided to take a further step forward.

"No one attack him." Layla said to the others. Xander was already twitching, reaching for his weapon, and Muka was taken aback as well. Vincent was the only one that remained somewhat calm.

"This one is incredibly strong." Layla said.

"Is all of what is happening, is all of what is happening now, his doing, how is that possible? What type of power is this?" Xander asked.

She knew it was Mundus' doing, and last time none were able to stop him, and without the black sword on her, it would be even more difficult to go against him again.

Minny had managed to put up a good fight, but in the end she had lost, and Layla would rather Minny stay safe in the space than come out.

"Alright, let me rephrase the question since you seem to be struggling with giving me an answer. Is Quinn in the red space? Has he gone to take care of Immortui?" Mundus asked, his voice causing a shiver to run down each and every one of their bodies.

If they told him, Layla had to wonder, would Mundus be a friend in this situation, or a foe.

‚Äî‚Äî-

Things were moving all over the place, and one of the celestials was keeping an eye on everything that was happening, unsure of what the overall outcome would be.

"Did your powers show an unfavourable future?" Sam asked.

"My powers so far have shown me this, what is happening right now. The Ancient Ones have gotten involved, and the others are learning of what is happening. I fear for what is to happen because, right now, this future is what I foresaw."

"And what, are you hoping that it will change?" Sam asked. "Is that possible?"

"I have told you before, the only times my predictions have proven to be wrong, are when there are Talens involved." Bliss answered. "And this time in history, at this point, there are three. Let's hope the three of them can make a drastic change, otherwise there is much worse to come."
