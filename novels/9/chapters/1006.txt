Chapter 1007 - Protect the Blade family?

After meeting Brock and finding out who he is, or who he was as well, Sam had his suspicions that the Blade family would be involved in all of this somehow. Due to Brock working at the Balde family. The fact that he was using some sort of disguise and how long he had to have been there for it just made sense.

Richard Eno, just didn‚Äôt seem like the type of person to do things on the whim. Everything he did, everything that happened was done with caution. In a way, it reminded Sam a little of himself, but the difference was, while Sam was playing chess with one opponent, it felt like Richard Eno was playing with four at the same time, and each one of the moves he made was intertwined with the others.

"We as a group over the years have worked very hard to make sure that we have eyes everywhere." Brock continued to explain." We have eyes in the Human world. We know everything that happened, from the start of the Civil war to before most of you here were born. We have kept eyes in the vampire world. We know what happened with Quinn, and Fex. However, we are unable to get involved so much there.

"Last, we even have eyes in the Dalki world as well, which is why we have decided that we can‚Äôt just sit back and watch to see how this plays out, we have to act now. Some things that Eno had predicted didn‚Äôt come true, and at the same time, unpredicted things have happened."

Sam being the type of person he was, so badly wanted to interrupt Brock at this moment. For each thing he was telling them there were hundreds of questions he wanted to ask, even things about the past before he was born.

However, he wouldn‚Äôt do so, and he had a feeling Brock had already been told what he could and couldn‚Äôt tell the others.

"For now, I will tell you what you need to know." Brock said. "From the beginning the Blades were an exciting group of people. From generation to generation they had the goal that was passed down of becoming the greatest human ever alive, and even before abilities, they had somewhat achieved that goal with their super being bodies.

"They would even give vampires a run for their money. However, our interest in them grew, not when they had discovered their ability, but when they had discovered a giant stone tablet. "

Hearing this, Logan and Sil knew exactly what they were talking about. Anyone who had been to the Blade island would. For the giant tablet could be seen when approaching the island, and Sil had grown up on the island itself.

"That tablet was special, I thought it was just a giant rock?" Sil interrupted.

Brock didn‚Äôt give him a telling off, but instead smiled at Sil. It seemed like Sil probably was the only person who would be able to interrupt Brock without him making a fuss over it.

"That rock is more special then any of you know, but again, the details about that will not benefit you in any way." Brock said. "What is important is that the Blades decided to set their base of operation around the giant tablet. Building a castle and a place to call home. Due to them finding the tablet, Eno had kept their eye on them, on top of that they were extraordinary humans that seemed to keep getting better by the second.

"At the time, the tablet was important to Eno‚Äôs research and what he wanted to do was keep an eye on it. So he asked me to personally infiltrate the Blade family. With my abilities it was an easy task to do. I could change who I was at any point. My main goal was to keep the Blade family a secret so no one would find out about the giant stone.

"I believe I did my task quite well, silencing anything about them and as generations passed it became a practice within their own family to keep it a secret. Even though they didn‚Äôt know who or why someone was doing it before.

"However, this didn‚Äôt become an important factor until a later time." Brock turned to Logan. "Logan, if you have discovered the base then I believe you already know the answer to how the Dalki were created. From a great demon tier beast that was shaped like a dragon. I don‚Äôt know if you know the details. Still, the demon tier dragon originally had two heads, and it had a special ability, allowing it to split its body into two.

"The vampires had only managed to capture half a demon tier beast, and that is why the Dalki are incomplete."

Logan knew most of these details already thanks to the logs his family had left him. It seemed he was correct and the reason the Dalki were attacking earth was due to the search of the other half of the demon tier beast.

"The Dalki have been searching for the other half of the demon tier beast, that is why they haven‚Äôt given up on attacking, and they never will until they run out of their lifespan. That other half of the dragon one day had actually arrived on earth, and the people who had dealt with it were the Blade family. Before anyone could even attempt to see it. But they didn‚Äôt defeat it, instead, it‚Äôs under their control and is still at the Blade island."

"Wait!" Logan interrupted. "We were on the Blade island, but me, Peter, Quinn and Sil, we never saw the Dragon!"

"The dragon was there." Sil said. "It has always been there, they keep it by the giant tablet."

Now Sil understood what Brock meant. The Balde family just saw the Dragon as a pet. They had no idea that the Dalki were after it.

"One half of the dragon is in the vampire world, one half in the Human world. The Dalki already have found out about the one in the vampire world, however they still do not know the location of the one in the Human world." Brock said. "The Blade island was meant to be kept a secret to all except a small few.

"But then someone had gone searching for the Blades. Someone that shouldn‚Äôt have known about them and succeeded in finding them." G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

The others could only guess that this was referring to Quinn.

"Now, with Hilston in control of the Blades, he no longer cares about hiding himself from the world. Even worse, our line of protection Is no longer there.

"That day when Hilston went to search for you Sil, I was on board that ship as well. I knew that the Blades had decided that they would no longer be hiding themselves, so we needed to come up with a new plan.

"I was the one that had chosen to advise you Sam, and Paul To turn your companions. At the time I also took Mona from the Bree family, she is safe with us. We did so, because If need be, and we need someone else to move the dragon, there needs to be someone who can control the dragon and copy her abilities."

At that moment, everyone on the table looked towards Sil. Even Mona didn‚Äôt have the power to control a demon tier beast. Which meant the only person that could was one that had an ability as strong as that of Hilston.

The fact that Mona was still alive and was with Eno came as a shock to a lot of them, and they needed time to take everything in.

"You have always been an interesting person Sil, and we have also kept our eyes on you, just in case something like this has happened. The only thing we didn‚Äôt expect was Hilston to lose that day and go into hiding, and for you to be taken away by someone else. The Dalki are going to move soon, and we need to protect the dragon at all costs."

When Brock said he had a lot to talk about, he wasn‚Äôt wrong. Still there were many things everyone wanted to ask him. Logan wanted to ask about who killed his parents, what their relationship was, but before all of that, Sam had another question before everyone else.

"I don‚Äôt think we have the right to go ahead and be making decisions on our leaders behalf like this. I know everyone wants to ask questions, but there is one person that needs to be here, and that‚Äôs Quinn." Sam said. "He should know about all of this."

Brock started to smile again.

"I‚Äôm afraid I have already told you everything that I can say. So any question you do wish to ask I will be unable to answer them. However, if you wish for me to clarify on some things that I have already spoken about then feel free. As for Quinn, you do not need to worry about him. I‚Äôm sure, Eno and Quinn will be talking right about now. And when everything is settled they will either return here together, or apart."
