Chapter 550 No Soul weapon

The first step was made through the golden ring, and immediately the timer had started. Just like Blip had explained, the ring he had gone through disappeared and right in front of him, the blue ring had turned gold. Going through each one, Quinn made quick work.

He was running faster than what was possible for a human being. Still, it wasn’t at a speed where they couldn’t follow him with his eyes, and this was only the start, where most of the rings were placed on the ground floor.

Nate seeing this, turned his head back to look at Sam, looking to him for some type of answer. Whenever Nate didn’t understand what was going on, he was sure he could rely on his friend. But right now, his face was also dumbfounded.

Thinking about it, Sam thought there must have been some trick. He tried to look at the beast gear on his feat. They didn’t look too fancy, they looked to be at the intermediate level, at most possibly the advance level. Still, that wouldn’t explain the speed he was showing.

Right now, he was as fast as a level 4 speed ability user. Unless his boots were even higher than the king tier level, it couldn’t be explained. Racking his brain, he tried to think of something and had thought of one solution. Another possibility, that Quinn possessed an ability that allowed him to use others.

He had heard of a couple people being able to use this before. This was the best guess he could make.

Continuing on with the trial, the ring locations started to get harder, as they were beginning to appear on top of the containers.

’I can’t slow down, I’ve got to do it as fast as I can.’ Quinn thought. His mind was only focused on one thing.

So much so, that he was showing even more incredible feats without realising it. When climbing on top of the storage units, he would often pull his whole body weight with a single hand. It wasn’t just a straightforward climb, it was like he could use his hand to launch him on top of each unit.

"What great upper body strength," Linda said with her mouth a little open.

"Maybe the gauntlets have an active ability. Especially if they’re at the advanced tier." Blip commented. "It’s great because speed users tend to suffer in power. And most beast gear that provides the user’s strength is a little heavy, slowing them down. He seems to have found a great balance."

’There, next one...and the next one...’ Looking around, Quinn would go from ring to ring, and finally, the last blue ring had turned gold, circling around the entire warehouse back to their starting point.

"Very impressive." Blip said as he gave a few claps standing from his seat.

’It looks like I did a good job.’

It was a fast time, but it was expected from a speed user, which was why Linda wondered why the two boys by her side looked to be in shock at the results. Something was up, every instinct in her body was telling her so.

She knew that Blip would be too happy that they just had some promising recruits come in. Too excited to notice everything that was happening around him. A good trait and lousy quality of the leader.

The test continued with the next person being Fex. To make sure he appeared more normal, Fex limited himself to running as fast as a fit human. However, he didn’t waste time using his string ability to help him.

Instead of climbing up the storage units, he would pull himself up with the string. Some of the obstacles required him to take a strange path, climbing on top of one object after another. But using his ability wisely, Fex was able to avoid that and create shortcuts of his own.

In the end, he had finished with an excellent fast time as well because of this. Not as quick as Quinn, but an unexpected result from the other. On the tablet, from everything Blip had seen, he had written down notes for Fex. Something he didn’t do for Quinn.

After Fex, they decided that it was Paul’s turn. It was fair to say not much was expected of Paul at all. Especially since they knew he had no ability. Paul held himself back a little and took his time to train his body.

He was still finding it difficult to control himself. He had no trouble completing the obstacle course and didn’t tire, in the end, he finished in a reasonable time. What Blip was most impressed by was for such an ordinary person, he seemed to have a lot of stamina. Even after finishing, he didn’t seem to tire.

Finally, it was Kazz’s turn. Out of everyone there, Quinn was a little worried about Kazz. He was sure she had great speed like himself being a vampire knight. Although he knew she wouldn’t use her blood powers, he wasn’t so sure about anything else.

When the test started, Quinn’s heart settled as soon as he saw that Kazz was taking it easy. Doing everything she looked to be faring as well as Paul had done. She had finished, and Quinn was happy that nothing out of the ordinary had happened.

Seeing everyone compete, Paul was looking at his hands. He could tell that Kazz had held back significantly, more so than him during the assessment.

’Am I the weakest in this group?’ It was a strange feeling for him. He was at the top of the ladder at one point, but now in front of all these kids, he was considered the weakest. He was wondering if it would always be this way, or just for now while he had turned.

At the desk, Linda was the only one paying more attention to the screen while Kazz’s assessment was happening. The other two boys seemed to be enticed by something else as they watched Kazz complete everything.

She watched the video of Paul’s run, she saw how he climbed certain places and struggled. While pausing in other areas to look for the golden rings. Looking at Kazz’s video, she had done the same thing.

’Their runs, they looked so similar.’ Linda thought. Double-checking quickly, her eyes widened as she saw it. It wasn’t almost the same, it was exactly the same. The time that Paul had gotten and the time that Kazz had gotten were within mini seconds of each other. Usually, she would think it was a coincidence, but so many things seemed strange about this group that she couldn’t think of it as so.

"You all did great, I can tell you will fit in really well with the Crows." Blip said. "Now it’s time to move on to the next part of the assessment. This one is fairly easy. When we are on the field, we must know each other’s power and how they work. So when everyone joins, we require them to show us their soul weapon."

The four of them looked at each other blankly for a second.

’Wait, don’t tell me.’ Nate had a dreaded thought. They were all first-year students. Every Traveller currently had completed their two years of military training. In the second year was when one would learn how to use their soul weapon. Being first-year students, Quinn and the others must have never learnt it. He thought.

"What, none of you have soul weapons?!" Blip shouted in disbelief. This would significantly weaken their chances out on the battlefield, whichever team they went in. Currently, in the Crows, they hadn’t recruited any first-year students from the military. It was the first time they had come across something like this.

Every member in the Crows had a soul weapon, and they would be placed at a disadvantage while here, never mind if they were to travel to another planet to compete with hunting a beast.

"Do any of you know how to use a soul weapon?" Blip asked.

Paul raised his hand when asked this.

"I know the concept, but I haven’t had an ability to use one yet."

Blip then started to look to the others for answers. Hoping one of them might have naturally unlocked it. His high hopes for them seemed to be dashed and thrown against the wall at the last second.

"If you don’t know how to use one, then you don’t know." Blip said, shrugging his shoulders. "I guess we can always have someone at the base try to teach you. But we don’t have the resources the military does, and it’s been a while since any of us have had to learn it. I know!" Blip said, clicking his fingers.

"Nate and Sam have just finished their second years. Maybe they can help you. Once this assessment is over, I’ll get them to start your soul weapon practice."

With that over, it was time to move on to the next part of the assessment.

"Now, this is the final part of the assessment. We do this with every single new member that comes into the base. A little sparring match. One of us will take it in turns personally going up against you one by one. Will get to see your skills being used first hand."

"Now who wants to go up against me first?" Blip asked with a smile.
