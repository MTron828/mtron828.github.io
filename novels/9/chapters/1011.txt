Chapter 1012 - Who, who, who

Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Out in the hunting field, it was almost time for the students to finish up with their first hunt. They were down to the final fifteen minutes, and even though it was exhausting for them, they needed to slug through if they had any chances or hopes of becoming one of the top classes.

After the hunt was done, they would go to meet Head general Innu, who was in charge of the expedition.

Innu wanted to count the number of crystals each class got in front of them all to see how well each group did. The Shelter didn’t have a space large enough for all the students and teachers to gather, so instead, Innu had picked a different place for them all to meet. It was located outside the Shelter not too far from it, a zone that was void of beasts, and even if there were some, basic tier beasts would be too afraid of a gathering of that size to do anything.

During this hunt, what had surprised Quinn was the fighting that had happened moments ago between his students and others. When he had been called, he expected one of the teachers to talk back to him. However, everything was solved with him just appearing.

Even he was surprised about this.

’I guess showing your power off once in a while can be a good thing.’ Quinn thought with a smile.

’Careful there.’ Vincent said. ’You don’t want to turn into them, do you? It would be best if you also heard both sides of the story before just claiming your students were in the right, no matter how likely it might be the other side.’

’I know, I know, it’s just nice to not have any arguments for a change.’ Quinn replied, but his voice at the end started to trail off. The reason being, a scent had entered his nose. It wasn’t just any scent either. It was clearly one of another vampire.

Turning his head around, he attempted to see where it was. Maybe Fex had come back or someone else, but he didn’t see any of them. Eventually, Quinn spotted someone in the desert off in the distance. Slowly making their way to Quinn and the students.

’What do I do? It’s a vampire, all the way out here. Why would one be here, and he’s coming towards the students. I have to stop him or see what they’re doing here.’ Quinn thought.

However, he couldn’t just leave the students alone unattended.

"Peter!" Quinn shouted. Although Peter wasn’t acting as Quinn’s assistant in this little assessment, his hunting ground wasn’t too far away from theirs, and he was hoping he would hear his call.

It didn’t take long for Peter to be running across the desert, kicking up piles of sand as he ran heavy-footed towards Quinn’s side.

"You called me?" Peter asked, but it didn’t take that long for him to see what Quinn was looking at. Although, it was hard to make out precisely what the figure looked like due to the heat waves warping the image of the man.

"I need you to look after the students while I go and see if this is trouble," Quinn replied.

"That’s okay, my teacher doesn’t need me. I kept looking for a chance to leave." Meanwhile, Peter’s teacher was actually tossing and turning, looking everywhere for him. He hadn’t said a word about leaving. Still, she wasn’t worried. He was the unkillable zombie, after all.

"But Quinn, let me know if you need back up," Peter said.

Walking out into the desert, Quinn was wondering who he would meet. For some reason, his heart was beating rapidly.

’I think I caught a glimpse, but I can’t be sure.’ Quinn thought.

The students who saw their teacher Hardy leave, when he reached a certain point, it was as if Hardy had just disappeared, and it was true for Peter as well. Looking out in the desert, he now couldn’t see a thing, the man he saw before or Quinn.

"Don’t worry everyone, get back to work. You guys want to win this beast hunting coalition, right!?"

When Quinn had finally arrived, he was standing opposite the man, they both looked at each other, and he could now see who it was clearly. The man had a curly moustache, and his hair was done up in a ponytail, but everything else Quinn had seen before.

The deep wrinkles on his forehead, the narrowness of his eyes and the confident look he had with him at all times.

"At least you aren’t quick to act and attack me like that other one, so should I introduce myself?" The man asked.

Quinn shook his head.

"There is no need. I already know who you are, Richard Eno."

Finally, Quinn had met the mysterious man after all this time, the grand scientist of the human race and also the first king. So many questions were running through Quinn’s head he didn’t know which one to ask first.

Why did he decide to trick Arthur, why wasn’t he asleep in his tomb, what was his goal in helping Vincent create the vampire system, and was he on the humans’ side, or the vampires’ side. For all Quinn knew, he could be working with Jim in helping the Dalki, stringing them all along just for some sick game of his.

"Close." The man said. ’But I’m not really Richard Eno, so all those questions you have you can keep in your head for a second while I explain what I’m doing here, and you should hear me out because I don’t have much time. "

Even though Quinn didn’t understand what Eno was saying, everything seemed like a wild goose chase. He wanted to do everything he could to just run over to Enos’ side and strap him in before he could run off, but his first line had shocked Quinn a bit.

’He isn’t Richard Eno?’

That didn’t make any sense. Quinn was sure of it, he certainly looked like the Eno he had seen, and even Vincent had confirmed that he looked similar to the man in the books. Still wanting to find out what Eno at least had to say, he kept his mouth shut, for now.

"What you don’t know, is currently at this moment, there are three others with a very similar appearance to myself meeting with others and delivering a message. This is a test Quinn, a test to see if you can succeed."

At the same time, over where General Innu was, a man with a similar appearance was standing in front of him. One of his sergeants who was by his side had gone to try and intercept the man from getting closer, but after grabbing his wrist, twisting it and kicking him at the back of the leg, almost too fast for them to see, they were sure to listen to what the man had to say.

And he was saying similar words to Innu right now, but for Quinn, there was an additional message.

"You have managed to accomplish what I never thought was possible, but somehow currently, the Human race is working together again, and without realising it, I think the Cursed faction is the glue that is holding it all together.

"With all three of your forces, I see a chance of you defeating the Dalki. Alone it is impossible. I need to see how strong that glue is, Quinn, how strong, and how long do you think that glue will last? You are hiding secrets from them, deep dark secrets that if they found out about them, would they see you as a friend or an enemy.

"Maybe, we’ll find out today," Eno stated and moved his arms, dragging them across the desert.

For a second, a screen appeared in front of Quinn, but it was distorted. It was the system screen, but it looked as if it wasn’t working correctly and was struggling to do something. Finally, the screen appeared, but the surrounding areas were all flashing red.
