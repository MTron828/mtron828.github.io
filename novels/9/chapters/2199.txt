There was a large issue at hand, but Quinn didn't want to share his worries with everyone, at least not yet until he knew there was absolutely nothing he could do about it. They already had a lot to worry about.

The problem at hand was how long it would take to create the armour, the celestial weapons that Alex had created, the blood guns, had taken a long time and even trapped his soul into the weapon.

After that, Quinn had also created the God-Slayer tier ring for his daughter, and he was in the forgery for around 2 weeks back then. This was completely different, they weren't creating a small accessory but were creating a whole armour set and possibly gauntlets as well.

With five crystals, Quinn felt like maybe it would take a whole month.

'If only Mundus had come with me‚Ä¶ he could have sped up the process, but he might think he has gotten involved enough already and after letting me keep the armour behind the Ancient Ones back. I doubt he would want to be involved in the creating process as well.'

"Everyone prepare as you have been doing, and make sure you all get plenty of rest." Quinn said. "I know a lot of you are restless and maybe want to train more, last second before the enemy arrives, but we have the element of surprise in this battle, we know they are coming, so we can be well rested.

"I need to speak to Geo for a bit about something‚Ä¶ I will have him call for you all when you are needed."

It was the first time, the first time they had seen Quinn talk formally to all of them. He wasn't speaking as a friend or as an ally but it was clear he was giving orders. The look in his eyes as well, they were more fierce and aged compared to before.

It made the others wonder, just what had he been through, what was he doing during this time. Still, he was the person they could trust most and they would continue to do so.

After everyone had left, Quinn cut straight to the chase, asking Geo about helping him with his requirements.

"Both of those things I can supply to you. One of the best forgeries there is and the strongest material that we can get our hands on. Even if you were to not use any crystals at all I guarantee the quality would be better than a lot of beast gear out there." Geo said, as he pasued for a second, making Quinn think there was a 'but' in there somehwere.

"Whats the problem?" Quinn asked.

"It's not so much of a problem‚Ä¶ maybe more of a concern. I can tell why you were a bit worried back there, if you wish to create an armour. You said that you would be overseeing this project yourself, yes?"

It was the only option they had, Quinn was the only one that could use the blood guns since they were attached to him, it wasn't like other weapons and that meant Alex was attached to him as well.

So the two of them would have to be the one to make the weapons.

"Yes‚Ä¶ which means, I might be away at the start of this war‚Ä¶ but this armour, I'll be honest, I believe that without it, we might not have a chance to win this battle." These words were not ones he wanted to say in front of many, and that included Geo, but he thought it was only fair for him, since he was risking his life.Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

"I understand, Dober who you met the last time you came here, he is one of our best forgers and has a great mind. He and his team can help you with everything you need. They will be able to speed up the process for you, at least on the materials side.

"If this armour is as important as you say it is, then it's better that they are helping you, rather than being out on the battlefield but there is one issue. The best forgrey and the materials needed are in the tower."

This didn't come as a huge shock based on what Quinn had seen before, but he wondered why did Geo think it was so much of an issue.

"The tower, the way it works each floor is more like a portal to another planet, another world. You should know that from the last time. You will have to stay in the tower while making the armour, but if the tower is destroyed then it won't be easy to come back."

Now Quinn could see the issue, he had his shadow link so he could always come back to Minny or Galen, but they were meant to go with Layla to help free Sil. Layla would never agree to split them apart, or be without them, but if they were all to stay here, then it might not be enough to break out Sil.

"We‚Ä¶ will just have to deal with the situation. They won't know the importance of the tower, and I'm sure you will protect it well. If worse comes to worse, I will travel as quickly as I can."

A plan had been set and before he was to inform everyone, he went ahead with Dober to look at the forgery and equipment in the tower. The Amra were already at work transferring the large rocks that were sparkling with green colour.

They were bringing them down from a floor, to where the forgery was based on around floor 30.

"So what do you think?" Dober asked.

'This is excellent Quinn!' Alex said with excitement. 'They have equipment that works much faster than that at the vampire settlement, and plus these guys, it was as if this alien race were made to be forgers with their four hands. Maybe we can make it a lot quicker than I originally thought.'

'Will it be quick enough to be made before they arrive.'

Alex's silence was a clear no, but being made quicker was certainly better.

"This is great, thank you for staying by my side and working so hard." Quinn said.

The others had been called to the front of the tower, as he needed to speak to them all.

"I don't like keeping you in the dark, which is why I have called you all to tell you something important." Quinn said. "Most likely, when the war starts, I won't be there to help you.

"I have to enter the tower, to create something that will give us a big advantage in this war. I will be as quick as I can be. I know the enemy is strong, but all of you are strong as well, and I believe in you.

"Stark, please step forward."

Stark did as was told and moved forward. Quinn then waved his hand, and a shadow appeared on the ground with it, the Celestial Fang set appeared on the ground. Everyone who had known Quinn for the longest time, knew what the armour was and how precious and powerful it was.

"You are the fastest being I know, and with this armour there will not be a single person that will be able to match up to your speed. Use this to save my friend Sil. This is a loan, for me to help you, and I expect the armour back in one piece."

Stark didn't know what to do, he had heard Quinn talk about this armour a few times, it was what allowed him to beat him in the grand event. Never did he think he could get such a thing. So he just went on his knees and started to thank Quinn dearly.

"I know you have a lot you must want to say to me, especially you, Layla and my family, but I think it's best we leave it here, because I want to make it clear. This is not good bye. I give every single one of you an order that you can not fail no matter what.

"Do not die." Quinn said, turning around and heading into the tower.
