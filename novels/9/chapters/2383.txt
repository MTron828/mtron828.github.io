Being a demon king didn't mean one was just powerful, or born with natural power. Although there was perhaps some talent involved, they weren't born this way. Just like the vampires, the Durum demons were a simple existence and through many of their kind being produced, stronger ones eventually appeared and this was the same for Kronker as well.

Because of this, he had been through many battles, all of them in the current world they were in. Still, he was sensitive to energy and could tell the person in front of him had a large amount of energy that was affecting the whole planet that they were on. 

'This energy, it's not only large, but all of it, it's his own energy!' Kronker thought. 'He isn't using the energy from the air around him, all of this is his own energy. Right now, he has enough energy to match us, the demon kings!'

It was greatly confusing Kronker because he was sure the person he was looking at now was the same person that he had faced moments ago, so how was there such a large difference in energy between the two.

After finishing condensing the energy in his fist, Quinn rushed forward. Kronker had braced himself, the crystals on his body shifted slightly, tightening up. His body was acting without even realising it. 

'What is this… am I afraid? Me, the demon king of the Durum race? I am one of those that is meant to go up against the gods! How could I be afraid of another demon!'

In an instant, moving faster than the clone had before, Quinn had appeared right in front of Kronker. His fist still condsend with the energy. He threw it out, slamming right into the centre chest of the demon king. A large dragon erupted from behind coming out from the back of his hand. 

The blood dragon was large in size, gigantic, almost as big as the champion Calva. The sheer power had caused Kronker's feet to slide back across the floor, and it wasn't just a few inches, this time he was moved back a few metres.

For a moment, Kronker looked down at his chest, the hard crystals on his body were still intact. They weren't damaged, or broken. Seeing this, a smile appeared on the demon king's face. 

'That was a strong hit, I can't remember the last time I was hit so hard. Maybe when I went up against Immortui? But the red crystals, each time they are broken, grow back stronger. My crystals are stronger than they were back then, this person is not stronger than me.'

The champion Calva was still amazed though, the punch, it was far stronger than what he had seen before, and the attacks that had been produced before. 

'How did this person suddenly get stronger? Wait, is this even the same person as before?' Calva thought.

"I can see your smile." Quinn said. "Did you not learn anything from our fight before?"

The words had confirmed what they thought before, about this person being the same one, but were confused about what he meant. When looking at his fist, they could see remnants of a red shadow covering his hand.

Images started to enter the demon king's mind, as he remembered about the blood shadow. Suddenly, a great force just as strong as the last hit him right in the chest. The image of a dragon made out of the aura, for a moment, like a ghost flashed and the large power had hit in the same place. 

Kronker's legs were pushed back even further on the ground, sliding across the floor it was more powerful then one could imagine, as a few bodies of other Durum were on the ground, and Kronker's foot just went right over them crushing them and breaking the crystals on their back. 

This time, the demon king had been pushed back almost to where the champion was, and when he finally stopped, a cracking sound was heard, and the tip of one of the red crystals on his chest, a large chunk had snapped off and fell onto the floor. 

The demon king was speechless, and it was as if time had moved in slow motion for him, as all he could do was watch it fall onto the floor. 

'My crystallised body…  it broke, and it didn't just break, but broke from a single hit?'

The champion Calva now had an idea of just how strong that hit was, because he too had once gone against the demon king, and in his attempt, although it looked like a good fight between the two, he was never able to break the crystals of the demon king. 

Out of a rage of blind anger, the demon king lifted his bladed hand once more. The red mist around it started to swirl, surrounding the arm before it was infused with a large amount of energy. Swinging it down, he was ready to slam it on the floor.

It was the same move that had been used last time, that had been used to defeat the strange invader, so he would just use it again to defeat him. The bladed hand then crashed onto the ground and dust and the red energy spilled out to the side. 

The Skullys in the trees could feel the power and they had to hold onto the trees, otherwise the shockwave would blow them away.I think you should take a look at

The attack though, wasn't the same as last time, the crystallised bladed hand was still in one piece, it hadn't broken down into small crystals. Looking at the end, he could see a dark covered purple shadow hand holding onto the blade. 

Quinn had condensed his shadow, to a single arm, covering the gauntlet and with his strength he stopped the sword.

'My attacks were going right through the shadow before! He was killed when he was hit a single time. None of this is making sense!' Kronker thought. 

The way his attack had just been stopped, it was hurting his pride, hurting all of the years he had been gathering power. How could a nobody do this? It was driving him slightly mad. 

Meanwhile, Quinn wasn't just going to be holding onto the bladed hand, with his other hand free, he threw out one fist of blood aura. It was fast, and hit Kronker in the chest again. 

The aura splattered on the outside, and started to move slightly, but it didn't hurt, and more felt like a fly had landed on him. Still, there was a slight pull and itching sensation where the attack had landed. 

After such a powerful attack, why would one produce something so weak? There was a reason behind Quinn's actions though, and one that only he would understand. 

[Blood forest fist has successfully absorbed blood]

[Blood from a demon king has been absorbed]

[The powerful blood is raging through your body.]

[The blood is mixing with the demon within]

If a demon general, increased his blood powers, Quinn always wanted to know what a demon king would do. So one of the first things he wanted to do, before finishing off his enemy, was to absorb their blood.
