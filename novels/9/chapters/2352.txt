Quinn really wasn't sure if his spear attack had defeated the Greater Demon, but it didn't seem to be willing to come out of the portal anymore. Instead more of the bat-like creatures had come through, and soon other flying creatures were seen coming out of the portal. 

These had larger wingspans than the bat-like creatures and a smaller frame, at the same time, they moved slightly faster in the air as well. 

With a blood forest fist, Quinn threw it out. The fists were just as fast as the blood bullets so even though the winged demons were faster than the bat-like ones, he was able to hit it cleanly, killing it in a single hit, but it wasn't his aim to just kill the creature.

'I see, so this is a step up from the bat-like creatures, but they seem to be just as high in number.' 

Using his boots, several puffs of clouds appeared and there were now three Quinn's. While the original Quinn continued to swing his arms out firing away the blood fists, the others were working on something else instead. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They were using the blood control to create the thousand blood swords. Controlling them, they flew about through the air, going right through the winged creatures. The blood swords had enough condensed blood that they wouldn't disappear after killing them as well.

That was the good thing about the clones created by the boots, they were still able to do everything that Quinn could, it was just at fifty percent of the power, but if they got hit lightly they would disappear. 

In this case where his enemies weren't even getting close to him, he could use multiple different skills.

'With this I can keep anything that comes through the portal at bay, hopefully the ones down below are doing well. However, it's only a matter of time until stronger demons come through… I just hope if all goes well, I get a signal from Agent 4.'

While Andy was busy fighting the rest of the vampires spread out across the arena like platform, in the centre where Jessica currently was, there was a large-scale battle going on. 

Magnus was standing in front of her, he had finished his transformation looking the same as he did before. The skull-like mask on the top half of his head. The centipede-like arms that stretched and emitted a strange green goo. 

·ƈθm It was hard to still call him a vampire.

Immediately, the first one to attack was Magnus. He stretched out his hand from his position, the large segments extending. There were two of them aiming right for the vampire originals. 

The two of them split up both heading in opposite directions. Edvard had leapt, changing his path, heading straight for Magnus. 

"You are one ugly thing!" Edvard shouted. "You don't even deserve to be called a vampire."

He swung his arm creating a large blood swipe, but his centipede-like hand had retracted in time blocking the attack. 

"Aren't you the least bit concerned about your friend?" A smile was revealed by Magnus as he moved his hand. 

When Edvard turned his head, he could see that Hikel was trapped. There was a glowing mark underneath him, no doubt he had used his power. 

'Damn it, did he set up traps all over the place, when did he do that?' Edvard thought. 'I guess in the end I was just lucky to avoid them all.' 

Seeing his friend trapped, he was fighting against the centipede like arm. Hikel had his hands stretched out, holding onto the strong pincers. The green goo was spilling onto the floor and part of it was going onto his skin, burning as smoke could be seen. 

Edvard held out his hand, holding it with the other by its elbow for support. Blood started to gather around the palm, and blasting out was a blood cannon worth of energy. It crashed into the side of the centipede-like hand, bending it slightly. It caused Magnus to retreat his hand back.

Now both of the arms had retracted, Magnus extended them both and they were going after Edvard this time instead. Rather than retreating back, or attacking the arms though, he charged right ahead. 

"You fool, you really have no idea how much power I have, how much power Immortui has given me!" Magnus shouted. 

The arms started to change in motion, as if they were alive they swirled around going in different patterns still heading toward Edvard it was hard for him to see exactly where the attack was going to come from, but he didn't worry about that. 

"Did you forget who I am Magnus?" Edvard asked. "I have survived this long, even though I was meant to die multiple times, and it's all due to my power." 

Magnus knew Edvard's power well, but what was he going to do in this situation. 

Appearing from above, was none other than Hikel. 

"Remember, there's two of us you have to go against."

Hikel swung his arm and rather than a blood swipe, there was a large amount of blood that came out through the air instead. As it hit the centipede-like arms it exploded, creating a dust cloud that went up into the air, and almost covered the whole area. 

The power of the explosion could be felt by Andy and the others behind them. Coming out form the smoke on the other end, was none other than Edvard. 

Who had grabbed Magnus right by the neck, he lifted his hand full of blood aura and punched Magnus in the head a few times. With every hit, a large amount of blood aura could be seen coming out from the other end of Magnus'  head. 

"I know that won't be enough to kill you. We almost got you back then, and we should have executed you for what you did in the past, but you still came back… well, we won't make the same mistake this time!" 

Edvard punched and punched, but the strange skull mask seemed to be quite solid. It wasn't breaking, and turning his head, he looked straight at Edvard. 

"Your luck has managed to make you survive you said, well survive this!" Magnus opened his mouth, and spat out a cloud of green smoke. 

Immediately Edvard could feel pain all over his eyes, it was intense that he had to let go. Then from above, one of Magnus' arms hit right into his back. Hitting Edvard into the ground.

Edvard could still feel his eyes burning, but he blindly swung his arm up, letting out a large amount of blood aura, in doing so he had managed to hit away one of the other arms that was coming in for an attack. 

"Damn you and your lucky self, how can you still hit me with an attack when you can't even see!" Magnus shouted, he was annoyed because he was only inches away before injecting him with the strange liquid he had used on Andy. 

"Explosive fist!" Hikel shifted in at a great speed, his knuckles were covered in blood and he hit Magnus' body right in the stomach. The explosive power hit and exploded right in the centre of Magnus' body causing his feet to slide across the ground. 

The edge of Hikel's hand was badly damaged from the explosion as well. His blood was explosive but that didn't mean he was immune to his own explosive powers.

'If we want to win this fight, then we have to be willing to take risks, and that includes if my life is taken as well.' 

Magnus regained his footing and started to smile, the wound that was created in his stomach could be seen healing right in front of their eyes. It was at an amazing speed, as if a vampire had consumed Dalki blood. 

"Hikel, you were always considered one of the stronger originals due to your power, now I understand why." Magnus stated. "But you see, people always seem to underestimate my power. Did you know that I can create a trap with any part of my body, it doesn't necessarily need to be my hands."

HIkel was wondering what he meant and it was same for Edvard as well. 

"Not only that, but the trap that I can now create, thanks to the special power granted to me by Immortui, has allowed for my powers to even grow further, and the size is much larger than you can imagine." 

When Magnus finished speaking, it was too late. A large white circle started to light up on the floor, and it was covering not only where Hikel was but Edvard as well, both of them had fallen into one of Magnus' traps. 

"Now this time, it will be a lot easier. Let's see how your luck does for you now, Edvard." Magnus stretched out his centipede-like arms the same as he did before, but both of the originals were unable to move. 

The pincers stabbed into both of thier stomachs, and pumping into thier bodies, was the strange green liquid. It continued to pump the strange liquid into them, while they could do nothing but watch, and feel the effects on thier body. 

The chance of them winning against Magnus had just lessened significantly.
