The Anger on Asura's face was genuine as he stood there. At that moment in time, he felt like he had made a mistake, no not just him but he and Mundus. If the two of them had never arrived here if they had never tried to obtain this crystal, then this monster of anger perhaps would have stayed here until the end of time, and now they had created an enemy of the Universe.

Just by Quinn turning up, the one who had been given the title of the First God Slayer had been given a goal, and the only person that was standing in his way right now was Quinn.

"ARGHHHH!!" Asura shouted into the great space, both hands by his waist. An overflowing energy surrounded his whole body, and the two large gauntlets lit up. Many of the floating pieces of land that were above him had moved, being chucked away from the simple sound of his voice.

The pieces of land crashed into others and formed smaller pieces as they were pushed away.

"You will be the first on the receiving end to feel my anger!" Asura jumped from his position, and his body was covered in flames while he went through the space. It looked like a meteorite was approaching Quinn to finish him off.

The distance between the two of them was miles apart, and he was covering it in seconds.

'My Shadow won't be quick enough. I need to strike back!' Quinn stomped both of his feet on the ground with a wide stance.

As he did this, the Qi rose from his body, and the blood formed around his arms. They started to spiral, creating the blood drills.

[Blood Hammer Drill]

Quinn threw them forward, and at the same time, Asura's fists clashed with his. Quinn was wearing his gauntlets.

The knuckles of Asura could be seen pushing forward, and when it hit the blood drill, it was pushed back, broken down and destroyed into nothing but red particles.

'His power‚Ä¶.what is it‚Ä¶it completely destroyed my evolved blood!'

It didn't stop there, the knuckles had slammed right into Quinn's, and he could feel the wave of energy enter his body immediately. The sheer power that was going through him was burning his insides.

It felt similar to Qi, yet different at the same time, a power he had never felt like this before. The closest person's power he could imagine to this was Ray's.

Both of Quinn's gauntlets had started to shatter. They broke into a thousand pieces falling to the floor as Quinn and his whole body was chucked back, hitting a large mound of the island they were on.

The force of the hit caused the large island of landmass to start to tilt to the point where it was vertical, but the space they were in was strange, giving each piece of landmass a certain type of gravity that allowed them to stick their feet down on the ground still.

Asura looked at the ground and could see the pieces of the broken gauntlet.

"Your equipment is rubbish," Asura stated.

Quinn broke out of the rubble, flinging rocks out of the air, and was back on the ground. The burning sensation that he could feel had left his body, and it was only something he could feel when the two of them were making contact with each other.

'This person is strong and powerful. Is it someone I can beat without using the Demon form?' Quinn thought.

There were a lot of problems, if Quinn was to fight against his opponent, he needed him to stay in one place if he wanted to use the effect of his soul weapon, the Shadow mist, but with an area like this and with the distance his opponent had just covered it would be hard to do.

'Quinn, you have to F*ck this guy up. Did you hear what he said about the gauntlets I made you? He said they were rubbish. Tell him it was the best I could do with the crystal you gave me. I bet I could make something better if I had some strange alien material as well!' Alex was clearly annoyed.

The gauntlets, the Drainmo demon tier gauntlet he had was destroyed, and anything else he used would be of a lower tier and would break again anyway. Thankfully, they weren't part of the Fang set.

'Let's see something first.' Quinn said as he summoned the 1000-blood swords above his head and swung them all toward the God Slayer.

For Asura, dealing with this was simple. He swung out his fist in the air, and a wave of energy went out, destroying all the blood swords just like that.

'I thought this was the case‚Ä¶the blood aura, I can only use it to enhance my physical attacks. When using it on its own, this person is too powerful. His Raw energy, whatever it is, is strong against my Blood aura, even when covered in Qi. It's simple this person has more powerful energy than me, and if that's the case, then this fight will have to turn into a physical one.'

From Quinn's observation, Asura didn't seem to have any special powers. He was a brawler. A fighter like the Dalki.

The shadow started to cover both of Quinn's hands where the gauntlets once were. The shadow was focused at one point and condensed to the point where they were on both of Quinn's hands.

They were glowing slightly purple when they were like this. In the past, Quinn only had enough shadow to condense it into one hand, but now he could do both.

'With this, I don't have to worry about the Shadow's speed because it's on my hands. I can block all of his attacks as long as I can move fast enough‚Ä¶and I'll be able to move a lot faster than him.'

[Nitro Accelerate activated]

Running from his position now, the one that was charging forward was Quinn. He darted right up to Asura, but before he reached him, he stopped for a split second.

[Shadow mist activated]

Out from Quinn's body, the shadow mist poured in all directions, and quickly moving again, he moved in a Zigzag-like pattern from the side. Quinn hit Asura right on the ribs with all his strength and Qi.

It was a solid, strong hit, the impact could be heard as two bangs went off, but Asura hadn't moved.

"ARGHHH!" Asura screamed, swinging his arm, trying to throw a hook and knock Quinn's head right off.

Lifting one of his arms, the fist hit Quinn's shadow arm, stopping it.

'My shadow, it works‚Ä¶there is a reason why it's a God Slayer ability. It can match up to what these guys can do as well.' Quinn.

With his other hand threw three punches straight to Asura's head, one after the other, flinging It back slightly. Asura went to punch Quinn back with both arms, but Quinn was able to block and hit them away and punched Asura in the stomach five times before Asura was able to deliver back punches of his own, but they were thwarted once again.

"You are pissing me off!" Asura shouted as he charged up both of his hands, and they moved slightly faster than before. Now Quinn was finding fewer opportunities to throw in punches of his own.

Instead, he was constantly blocking with his own shadow hands, moving them into place.

'Am I imagining things‚Ä¶or is he getting faster.' Quinn thought.

Trying to change tactics to still damage his opponent, Quinn grabbed both of Asura's large gauntlets. He extended the shadow from his hands a little bit to create larger hands for himself and stopped it in its tracks.

'All of his power, everything so far, has been in his fists. If I stop them, then maybe I can do a bit more damage with my blood aura!' Quinn thought as he started to gather the blood aura in his mouth.

It was a move he didn't use often, but his hands were busy holding onto Asura's. The blood-breath, a move from Laxmus's book, was ready to fire into Asura's head until a fist from below hit Quinn right on the chin, lifting him in the air.

Then another fist hit Quinn once again, sending him flying. This time when he hit a dirt mound, his body had broken right through it and slammed onto another floating piece of land.

[Blood bank has been used]

'Sh*t sh*t, I need to recover. What happened? How did he hit me? I didn't let go of his hand?' Quinn thought. When he stood up and looked at Asura, he could see now Asura had six arms, all of them covered in the same gauntlet-like material.

'All of his power, that energy was in his two hands‚Ä¶and now he has six of them‚Ä¶I can't hold back‚Ä¶but I can't just use or rely on the Demon form. If this were a fight against Ray, in the middle of the war, using the Demon form would kill them all.' Quinn thought.

'I have to try. There is one more trick that I haven't tried‚Ä¶I have to try it!'
