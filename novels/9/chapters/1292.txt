Chapter 1293 - Jim's Grudge

At first Quinn had believed that he would have to drain the strength of the Dalki, but realising that his Shadow overload skill was enough to hold the Dragon, he decided to spare them. The Vampire Lord was sure he might need them later and instead of him directly lifting the tablet from the ground, there was a better person, or in this case being, for the job.

'I only have a limited amount of time using Shadow overload, and I would like to use it for as little as possible otherwise my MC cells are going to take quite the hit.' Quinn thought, as he continued to block the flames coming from the Dragon's mouth.

With both of them seeing that the flames weren't effective, Quinn knew what was going to happen next. Just as Vincent had watched it do in the fight against Eno, the Dragon turned its body, ready to use its gigantic tail, but Quinn was preparing his own thing as well.

[Skill activated Shadow void]

Shadow had been spreading across the ground far and wide ever since Quinn had activated his soul weapon, now that he had activated the skill, a large dome-like shadow covered both of them. Seeing the incoming tail, Quinn quickly sank into his shadows and appeared above the Dragon falling towards its back.

The middle part of the tail hit nothing but air, yet the tip of it scratched the outside of the dome. To Quinn's surprise this left a hole in the dome, yet his shadows started to gather there, as if it was healing from a cut‚Ä¶

'Looks like it really wants to get out of this place, but I'm right where I want to be.' Quinn took a glance at the tablet and tree that had also been trapped inside the dome. His current plan required him to buy time for the tree to follow his new command.

He had to make sure the tree wouldn't be hit by any of the Dragon's attacks. It might have come from a Demon tier tree and Quinn knew that it had roots all over the island, yet he didn't want to gamble on how sturdy it was.

Fortunately, the Dragon seemed to be fully focused on him.

This was great for Quinn, since it meant the Demon tier beast had yet to notice the roots that had started to dig at the base of the tablet. As they sprouted from the ground around it, they used their tips like hands, trying to pull it from above, while pushing it from the ground underneath, yet neither method seemed to be working on first glance.

'I can tell you're strong and I'm currently still too weak to defeat you.' Quinn thought. 'Which is why, I'll have to borrow your power again, so I can protect you!'

His white gauntlet hand was placed onto the back of the Dragon and the active skill was activated once more. Power was quickly going into Quinn as the Dragon roared even louder in anger, doing his best to get rid of the pest on him.

It was at that moment that Quinn felt something else. He had felt the connection to those he had turned fluctuate every so often, however this time one had been cut. The life of one of his companions had been lost, and once again he had not been there to prevent it.

"ARGHHH!" Quinn screamed even harder, full of pain as the energy continued to spread into his body, while tears started falling down his face.

‚Äî‚Äî

An unknown distance away from where Quinn and the Dragon were, Eno had left the cave in the waterfall and had spotted someone he didn't think he would run into all the way out here. G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

"You're looking quite well for an old timer, but you don't have to be so loud. My ears are good enough to hear you even if you were to just whisper my name." Jim spoke to him in a casual tone.

His choice of garments was that of a typical vampire, meaning he was mostly covered in black while also wearing a long trench coat. He looked to be in his thirties, yet his hair style was completely out of place for the current age, indicating his real age. Jim had grand sideburns that covered his sides, while his hair was overrun at the top with curls which were nevertheless neatly kept up for its shape.

Richard was slightly surprised that the Dalki by Jim's side were merely one spikes. He would have thought that one of the masterminds behind this whole fight would have had better guards than that, at least three or four spikes.

"Your appearance hasn't changed.'' Richard noted, as he casually jumped from the rock he was on and landed on the land just by the river. The two of them now were a good ten meters away from each other, yet neither one had opened hostilities.

Before Jim had been a Vampire knight working under his nephew Vincent, he had been the previous leader, which was why it was very strange for a vampire Jim's age to still have his young appearance. Realistically, he should have weakened by now.

"What have you done? ‚Ä¶have you really fallen that low? To use the lives of humans to extend your own?" Richard asked in disbelief.

Jim started to chuckle at his ancestor's reaction.

"And what if I have? Don't the vampires also use humans, even if they are mere clones for their blood supply. How have you not been able to face the simple reality that human lives are meant to be used by us? Aren't you wearing a set of Blood armour created from dead vampires? How are you any different from me in that regard?"

"We are different from the beginning." Richard insisted. "You only exist because of me! Jim, I did my best to try and sympathize with you, but I'm still unable to understand why you chose to go through with this madness! I understand that you've been wronged, that your accomplishments have always been diminished, but then shouldn't your anger be directed at the vampire settlement? Why are you helping the Dalki, no why are you trying to get rid of the humans?"

During their conversation, it sounded as if Richard was getting angry at points, only to quickly settle down soon after calming himself. Jim just smiled, yet this simple genuine gesture was all the more frightening. He seemed happy for the chance to talk with Richard as if he had been looking forward to it.

"Does it really look this way to you? Our side is the one who has united Humans, Vampires and even Dalki, all working together. Doesn't that sound like a perfect utopia to you? As for your question, don't worry, I'm going to teach the vampires their lesson soon enough."

"What do you think will happen when all the human's in existence are gone from this universe? Those vampires think that they are more important than humans, but don't realise that they are actually weaker."

"I don't just want to beat them, no I want to make them suffer. I will get rid of every drop of blood and I shall enjoy watching them starve until eventually they will realise that there is only one alternative left for them."

"The Dalki." Richard concluded. "So your reason is so petty. Is it because the vampires rejected your idea, rejected you and the Dalki, that you are forcing them to come crawling to you for help?! How childish is that?!"

Richard didn't think he had gotten all the answers from Jim about why he was doing what he was doing, but this conversation had made one thing clear. Jim's mind was made up and there was no way of changing that.

Since there was no way to get through to him by talking, Richard started to gather his hands together and the spire on the top of his head glowed.

"Come on, are you really going to attack me?" Jim asked, letting out a sigh. "As I recall, you still owe me a favour which I never got the chance to make use of. Don't you believe in fairness, equivalent exchange? Well, I would say now's the perfect time to call in that favour."

"It's rather simple, really. 'Don't get in my way'. Just let me pass and watch as I subdue the Demon tier beast. Otherwise‚Ä¶"

Jim placed his hand on the Dalki by his side. The back of the Dalki started to light up. A change was occurring as energy flowed through the creature. It was brief but for a second it looked like Richard could catch something that looked to be embedded in the palm of Jim's hand.

'A crystal of some sort?'

A few seconds later as the light faded, the Dalki's appearance had drastically changed. It had grown an entire foot larger, sprouted wings on it's back, its scale-like features had gotten more compact, and darker, and worse of all the number of spikes on its back had changed.

In total there were six spikes present.
