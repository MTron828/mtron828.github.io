Chapter Ôªø1877 A vampire and a werewolf

Quinn continued to look at his stat points. He was wondering if he had miscounted, but without a doubt the number that was on the screen was true. From this quest alone, he had earned around 500,000 MC points.

'How was I even able to get such a reward from the system in the first place?' Quinn started to think. 'Is the system still rewarding me through equivalent exchange? Has the system continued to grow like Vincent thought? Or was it something else?'

Thinking about it more, Quinn did see that this time the system stated that the Universe was the one that wanted to reward him for his tasks, which made him wonder, was the Universe trying to push him in a general direction?

For him, a Celestial to go against his natural enemy, the Godslayers, it was hard to say and due to not knowing any other Celestials that he could just speak to, he was also unable to find out if they received such things for defeating Godslayers.

Either way, he had been given what he had been given and it was more than he had ever expected. For a long time, Quinn thought about his strength. It had been at its greatest when he had originally turned into the Celestial he is today.

There was a surge of power from the transformation, his celestial energy could be used freely and, on top of that, Quinn had gathered the blood of those from all over to defeat his enemy. However, he felt like this entire time he had never been able to get to that same place again.

He tried to make up for his loss of strength by learning new skills and becoming creative in the way he used celestial energy and more. With all of that, Quinn had grown stronger, but still not comparable to that time.

Now though, with his new skills improving his shadow as well as with the additional 500,000 MC points, Quinn believed that he could do more, and without a doubt, he was currently at the strongest he had ever been.

Quinn looked at his fist and clenched it hard with a smile on his face. It was hard not to smile at this achievement, especially with how many bad turns there had been lately in his life.ReùíÇùíÇd the latest stories ùíên novùíÜlbin(.)com

'If only I could go to the Celestial space with all my powers now. I would love to show the arrogant gods what's up.'

It was only then, after hearing the sound of the voices next to him, that Quinn had noticed that the others had arrived. He had seen them while he was absorbing energy but had not really paid attention to them.

Quickly he rushed over and could see that they were all crowded around Chris.

"Judging from the fact that everyone is around you and isn't scared, I have to believe what you said is true." Quinn stated.

"Is that your way of apologizing?" Chris asked, standing up off the floor. His outside wounds had healed but there was clearly some damage inside him as well.

"I'm sorry." Quinn replied. "Things have been difficult for me as well. Since I've come back I've lost a lot of people, and you can't blame me due to the last time we met as well."

Soon sniffling sounds interrupted the group. Turning around they could all see that Minny had burst into tears.

"Da-da-daddy!" Minny screamed and leapt up from where she was and grabbed Quinn right by the neck.

For a second, Quinn couldn't breathe, as he slowly held her in his arms and close to his chest.

"Where did you go? Why did it take you so long to get back!" Minny started to cry.

"I'm sorry." Quinn said as he wiped away Minny's tears. A lot of them were wondering the same thing, but didn't want to ruin this father and daughter moment. "I tried to come back as quickly as possible, but it's my fault that you were left on your own."

"I wasn't strong enough to stay by your side, but I won't let that happen again." Quinn smiled.

The sniffles and the tears slowed down as Minny grabbed Quinn by the face and started to rub her large fat cheek against his. The females' hearts melted as they saw this affection.

Quinn was already an incredibly handsome man and seeing him act this way with Minny was just melting the women's hearts.

"Quinn, you are a good dad‚Ä¶ maybe you need a wife as well." Muka said confidently without any embarrassment in her voice.

Jessica wished that she could have been as brave as Muka, but when looking at the two of them, she just felt like it was impossible to compete.

'He still doesn't know about Layla yet either.' Jessica thought, as the list of women who were interested in Quinn just kept piling up.

"Quinn, the two of us have a lot to talk about, and I'm sure there is a lot that the others want to share with you as well." Chris stated. "But since they are all here, there is one more thing I need to do before I leave."

Moving away from the others, it looked like Chris was ready to jump in the direction of the ship, but before he did, Sil had approached him.

"You're planning to go back right? Don't worry, I'll pop you over there, turn invisible, let you do your thing and we can come back." Sil said.

With all of his abilities, there seemed to be nothing that the group couldn't do. Once changing out his abilities, Sil did just that, teleporting Chris right on the deck of the ship towards the front. In an instant, he turned invisible.

There were a lot of people on the deck, panicking, worried, scared and wondering if they should try and leave, but they could suddenly see Chris in front of them and no one else.

"Agent 1, you have to help us, the Ship, it's under attack!" One man cried.

Soon, many followed after him, pleading for Chris to help out those in Pure. They had assumed seeing him now, that he wasn't present and that was how the ship had come to be in its current state.

"Enough! Chris shouted out to them all with a powerful Qi voice. They could feel the vibrations in their body, causing them all to shut up.

"I am not here to help you." Chris said. "In fact, I am here to tell you the truth. I was the one that started the attack on the ship. I was the one that caused all of this mess. I know many of you may be upset or annoyed with me, but I will explain myself.

"Pure is not the group you think it is. The leader Zero is using everyone, using even the members and soldiers of Pure for his own goal. He has been doing this from the very beginning and Pure has lost its goal ever since the loss of Lucy, the original founder.

"Zero has been using humans for experimentation. Trying to combine them with beasts. He has used slaves to make his life longer. The man that you look up to, the organization that you have been supporting has been doing nothing but use you.

"I understand that many of you don't believe me, and perhaps will never believe me, but I have not done any of this because I want you to thank me, or to like me, you may all even hate me for ruining your life no matter what the reason.

"I have done this because I have done what I believe is right. I couldn't stand by and do nothing anymore."

After Chris had said his words, there was quiet for a few moments until the crowd started once again.

"Traitor! You attacked our home!"

"You've gone to the Green's side, you're just doing this to support them, you have ruined everything for us!"

There were many words, many insults, and many tears as well. Turning his back towards them, it was the signal that Chris was ready to go.

'I don't mind being the villain of the people, if that's what they need.' Chris thought.

The next second he was teleported and back on the island with everyone else.

"Those people will one day understand what you did for them." Sil said as he made himself reappear. Chris was stronger than him in some ways, because if he was in Chris's position he would just be filled with anger. The people he was doing everything for and trying to help had treated him like that!

"Alright, you can take us back to Green City, right?" Quinn asked Sil.

"Of course, who do you think I am?" Sil said as he told everyone to gather.

"A Werewolf, A Vampire, A Superhuman, and the strongest undead you will ever see." Peter commented. "I don't think we will have any problem taking out Zero."

The portal opened up, and it was time for them to head back to Green City, as everyone had a lot to talk about.
