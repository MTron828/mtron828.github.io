Chapter 929 - Absolute Shadow

Although there was no hesitation for Quinn when he had selected the option to activate his soul weapon, now that his body was in the middle of a strange transformation, he did have a lot of worries on his mind.

Unlike the last soul weapon Quinn had used, he was able to test its uses and figure out how best and when to use it. Testing was extremely helpful due to the large drawback Quinn’s item type soul weapon had. If his enhancement type soul weapon also had a similar drawback, he would be finding out about it during the fight.

Not just the drawbacks, everything about the soul weapon he would have to try to find on the job, learning how to use it and what it could do. All while fighting one of the strongest enemies he had ever faced. Of course, this would make anyone a little nervous.

The shadow that was on Quinn’s back started to do something strange, it grew in size after consuming the shadows of the others, and when Quinn had activated the soul weapon, it rose up in the air slightly above Quinn.

For the first time, everyone around could see the shadow detached from Quinn’s body. When using most of Quinn’s shadow skills, there was one important factor in them all, that he had to be touching the shadow.

Shadow path, allowed a trail to be led out, shadow sink and travel would only work based on how far the shadow was spread, and shadow control, Quinn was never allowed to use it, if it detached from his body.

The only shadow skills that still worked a little away from Quinn was shadow link, connecting to other shadow users shadow, and Shadow on. Even then, this felt like Quinn was using their shadow rather than his own.

The shadow didn’t remain in the air, and was moving about fiercely. Moving around as if it was alive, and soon a purple glow could be seen around the edges.

’Just what is this enhancement type?’ Quinn thought. ’The other type was similar to a blood weapon, but this seems to be based completely on my shadow powers.’

’Vampires aren’t known to have soul weapons, you are unique in that aspect, and their blood weapons are created from the crystals of other vampires. Just like Arthurs weapon, it isn’t based on his own power. This soul weapon is made just for you, Quinn.’ Said Vincent.

At that moment, the large shadow that was hovering above Quinn swooped down and started to enter his mouth. It slid down his throat and into his belly. However, it didn’t stop there, as Quinn could feel it taking over every cell in his body. His blood cells, the organs, everything was being consumed and changed by the shadow.

’What is this!’ He wasn’t in pain, but the feeling was certainly odd as if someone was touching his cuts with a furry hand.

After covering nearly every part of the inside of Quinn’s body, it started to spread to the outside as well. Seeping through his skin, the shadow covered his forearms. It looked like purple fur was growing from Quinn’s skin, and soon he was covered head to toe in the purple shadow.

His clothes were unable to be seen. His hair was standing up, floating not from the wind but the strange power that possessed it. The only thing that they could see was Quinn’s eyes. His clothes were even covered.

He looked more menacing, darker than anything they had ever witnessed before.

[Shadow overload is now in use]

[For a limited time, MC cells won’t be affected while using the shadow ability]

[You have absolute control over your shadows]

Multiple notifications appeared in front of Quinn, and if he had the time, he would have clicked on them all to see if they further explained what this soul weapon did, but the blood swipes from Cindy’s wh.i.p.s were soon coming at him.

"There’s one thing I understand. If I’m right, no matter how much I use my shadow skills, my MC points won’t drop!" Quinn thought, spreading out his arms, and soon Shadows were seen rising in front of the others and in front of him as well.

However, it didn’t look the same as it did before. Usually, everything would be connected to Quinn, but this time the shadow had raised where all the others were standing.

’Is this the absolute control over the shadows?’ Quinn thought.

All of the blood swipes that Cindy had created, as soon as they had touched the shadow they immediately slowed down. It didn’t even look like they were moving, and Quinn’s MC points hadn’t gone down just as expected.

The others moved out of the way, and Quinn quickly got rid of the shadow allowing the attack to move forward into nothing.

’This shadow, can it really be used like that?’ Quinn started to wonder.

Out of anger seeing her attacks stopped like they were nothing, Cindy swung her two wh.i.p.s wilder, putting more strength in her hip, creating faster and stronger attacks.

"I have the king’s power. How can someone like you stop it!" She screamed.

Thinking back, Vincent was always impressed with how quickly he had learnt the vampire martial arts, using the shadow abilities and all the other things he was taught. In a way, Quinn was a blank canvas having no abilities, and he soaked everything in like a sponge.

Running ahead, Quinn showed no fear, he was sure his plan was going to work, and with each of the blood swipes, he held out his hand. Soon in front of them, small little portals of shadow opened up, stopping them mid-air.

For every blood swipe, he would make a small circle of shadow stopping it.

’This isn’t the only skill I can use either.’

Then, little small shadow portals started to appear behind Cindy as well. They floated in place, but it looked like they were there doing nothing. Seeing this, Cindy attempted to hit the end of them with her whip, but as she did, she only saw her whip slow down slightly when the tip had touched the shadow, but it had done nothing else to it.

[Shadow sink]

Activating his next skill, Quinn made it so the blood swipes that had been stopped mid-air from the first set of shadow circles sunk into the shadow themselves, and soon they were reappearing from where the new shadows were placed all around Cindy. Her own attack was now being used against her.

A similar scene was witnessed not long ago. Where Bryce had to face hundreds of blood swipes raining down on him, and Now Cindy had to do the same. However, her strength was strong, and with a single swing of her whip, she managed to wipe out ten of the swipes she created.

She did the same with the other side, but soon some of the strikes had ended up hitting her. As they weren’t the only ones, she had to focus on.

At that moment, everyone was left with their mouths wide open on the stage as it looked like the table’s had turned.

"Is this something all punishers can do?" Kazz asked, witnessing the power.

"In my whole time as a vampire, I have never seen the shadow being used in such a way before. This kid is different." Bryce stated. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Moments later, the other leaders that were sent away had returned. After Remus had been defeated, it was easy to control the chaos, and things had returned to normal. Worried about what was happening, they returned as soon as possible.

Muka looked around and could see all of the leaders nearly perished, and out in the square facing Cindy, was someone covered in shadows.

"Is that Quinn?!" Muka said, "We should help him."

"Don’t!" Bryce shouted. "Cindy is far beyond any of our levels, and if that boy still has a human heart, she could use you against him. Besides, you would just be giving her more blood to use."

"You forgot one more thing," Sam said, never taking his eyes off the fight. "Does it really look like Quinn needs help right now?"

Turning their attention back to the fight, it looked like Cindy had been roughed up a little. She was hurt, but it wasn’t too bad due to the armour she was wearing. What their eyes were most drawn to, was what Quinn was holding in his hands. Although Holding wasn’t the correct word.

It reminded some of those of the scythes that Quinn would use, combining his blood with the shadow. He had done something similar this time only when they weren’t attached.

He threw both of them out, and they came out lightning fast. Cindy tried to hit one of them with her whip, but when it touched the shadow, her attack stopped again, and soon Quinn moved the disk, and they continued to go straight for her waist, ready to cut her body in half.
