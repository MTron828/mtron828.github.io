The simulation continued on, and all of them were able to continue to watch the fight. It was amazing as they were able to walk through the field as if they were really there, but it also made the sadness hit just that much more.

They could see everything in detail, the worried look on the people's faces, the frightened voices as they called for help and shouted out for the other's names. Seeing this, especially for Quinn, he inwardly struggled.

What was he doing while all of this was going on? Right now, he wanted to help, but he needed to remind himself that it was all a simulation, and he needed to see the end, to see what it was that Logan wanted to show him.

With the weapons in their hands, the other Blades were faring much better than they were before. They had never come across such powerful weapons and more, so more than one of them were able to use them.

At the same time, there was no longer oncoming pressure as both Borden and Sil were able to deal with most of the oncoming Dalki. Shiro had stayed behind to stay close to the other Blade members, he wasn't so sure if Borden and Sil were doing it instinctively but they were taking out all of the four spikes that had abilities, only allowing a few of the three spikes to come attack them.

"This… is going well, at this rate, with all of Sil's clones as well, we will be safe. The problem is, how do we take out the ship, and just how many are on board."

Shiro was right to worry, because there was more than just the Dalki onboard the ship. This was the Marpo Cruise which had been going through space for a while now, and along the way they had picked up a number of different mercenaries from different races.

Which was just one of the reasons, despite Jack seeing all of this, he wasn't panicked at all, but the main reason, he wasn't panicked, was because he had H on his side.

On the ground, the Daliki were being cleared up fairly quickly, their bodies torn and thrown about on the ground, pieces of them having been left as nothing but cinders.

It wasn't all good news for the Blades though as there were many on their side that had lost their lives also, but in this situation they needed to look at what they had. Thankfully, it looked like the whole thing would soon be over, as the pods were no longer coming down from above nor were the energy blasts, and Borden had finished of the last of the Dalki.

"ARGHHH!" Borden screamed, covered in green blood as he delivered a final punch right through one of the Dalki's chest, pulling it out, it had fallen to the floor.

Since all the Sil and his clones were done, they stood there above their beaten enemy, but Sil didn't make the clones go away, because he knew that it wasn't the end. The real Sil looked up at the ship.

"These Dalki had abilities somehow. Although most of them were weak… what if a high spiked Dalki were to appear, with a high level ability? I need to stop that ship and destroy everything inside. Who knows, it might already be the case." Sil thought.

Just as he was getting ready to change his abilities to fly up to the ship and face them alone, something was seen blasting through the sky. An incredibly large thick blue lighting bolt, shocked right from underneath the ship and it headed right for them.

It was powerful, and too fast for Sil to react to stop the attack, but instead he used his powers to create a shield so the others weren't hurt. When the lightning bolt crashed into the ground, a wave of rocks from the ground kicked up, at least five metres high.

It blasted it out, continuing on for at least a mile, but the rocks that had hit the shield created by Sil, were falling in place.

"Borden… was ahead of Sil… but he should be alright, right?" Shiro thought as he covered himself as some of the dirt was getting through parts of the shield. "What even was that? Was it an attack from the ship, but then why did it look like a lighting bolt?"

Eventually, the dust started to settle and as it did they could see a large figure, in their own self made crater. It wasn't an attack from the ship, but instead it was someone, or something landing in the middle of the battlefield.

"Is that a Dalki?" Shiro thought as he saw the outward appearance of it.

It was slightly larger than a regular Dalki, and its body shape was a bit different. Usually Dalki's were these masses of muscle, covered in dark scales from head to toe. This one, although larger, was slightly more shaped like a human.

Even though the face and body was covered in spikes from head to toe, its face also looked slightly like that of a human as well. It was the structure of it all.

'That face… why does it feel familiar?' Vorden said, as he looked at the scene in front of him through Shiro's eyes.

'I have the same feeling, is it someone we know?' Raten asked.

Although Shiro was interested in why the two thought this Dalki looked familiar, he was much more concerned about something else instead. On its back, if he wasn't miscounting, he could see 8 spikes leading down it.

This shook Shiro to his very core, he could feel his heart racing. The other Blades could see it too, but they weren't having the same reaction, because they weren't there back then, unlike him.

'An 8 spiked Dalki… but how… the only one that ever existed before was Graham, and Quinn defeated him. It nearly took him everything he had, all of his power, to defeat him back then.'

The sight of what Graham could do, the sheer power he held in his hands, and now all of this was in front of them. It was safe to say that if Sil was unable to defeat a Dalki on the level of Graham, then they would all be dead, because their small attacks and power wouldn't be able to help in the fight at all.

'Can Sil do this…. Can he do this without Quinn?' Shrio asked. It was quite clear why they were so confident now, why they were happy to battle out of space.

'Sil has had a 1000 years to grow since then.' Vorden almost shouted. 'Do you really think he wouldn't be able to handle an 8 spike, after all that time. If anything, the fact that it's been that long, and the highest spiked Dalki they have is an 8 spiked, shows that we don't have to worry."

Vorden was shouting because he didn't like the fact that Shiro was doubting Sil, not at a time like this.

'I think you're forgetting something.' Raten added, being the voice of reason for once. 'That is not just an 8 spiked Dalki. We saw how it came here, from the sky in a bolt of lighting, that was most likely an ability, and if you asked me it looked pretty strong.'

Vorden didn't say anything else, they knew that the lighting ability was one of the strongest, it was why the Blades used it most of the time including Sil, and for that ability to be on an 8 Spiked Dalki it was a scary thought.

Sil could now see the Dalki as well, and just like his brothers, when he saw the figure and looked at its face, deep into its eyes it was familiar for some reason.

"Why… do you seem so familiar?" Sil asked.

When he did, the Dalki looked directly into his eyes, and the scales started to peel away from its face.

Up above, in the Marpo Crusie watching this all. There was an unstoppable laughter coming from Jack.

"Hahaha, HAHA!"
