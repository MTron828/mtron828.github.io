Chapter 2497 Sil in trouble?

On the planet where the battle between Sil and Immortui was taking place, the portals that were opening up were clearly visible because there was nothing on the planet to block their view. The ground was a hard crystal-like material, but there were no large structures or plants to obstruct their vision. So both of them could see the Divine Brigade coming out of the portals and heading straight for them.

With their dark-coloured spears, they started to blast away at the planet. For Sil, the Black Swordsman stayed by his side and swung his sword fast and with smooth motions, deflecting all of the attacks coming their way.

For Immortui, he turned his back away from Sil and stood there with his strange armour covering the rest of his body. All of the attacks hit him, but appeared to have no effect as they smashed into his body.

Lifting his hand up, he used it to cover his eyes to see a little clearer due to all of the attacks. "So instead of waiting for me to come to you, you have decided to come to me then?" Immortui analyzed the situation.

He soon saw a group of them come towards him with spears in their hands. As they went to thrust them forward, the serpent on his shoulder stretched out, becoming longer and larger in size. It avoided one of the spears and took a big bite right into the dark being. It then swung its body, crashing it into another. At the same time, the other serpent over his shoulder did the same. Both of the serpents were moving on their own will at a fast speed as they picked and threw out all of the Divine beings that were coming close to Immortui, and not a single one was able to reach him.

"It looks like I will need to act myself now. The rest, they know what to do," Immortui said, as he lifted his hand up towards the portals where the beings were constantly pouring in.

Gathering in the palm of his hand was all of the red mist, growing large and condensing into a ball. A dark red orb was shaking with power in both of his hands.

Aiming it into space, he shoved both of them out, and large beams of power coloured the entire sky red. The ground shook as the sky was dyed with Immortui's power. The Divine beings couldn't even be seen anymore as they were completely overwhelmed, and as the attack hit the portals, they looked to be disrupted, flashing in and out and eventually disappearing completely.

"That's one area down," Immortui said.

Slightly to his left in the sky and to his right, he could see the beings continuing to pour through other portals. Now that he had breathing space from those next to him, both of the serpents wrapped around his arms.

Twisting his body, he threw his fist out, unleashing a massive amount of power to one side. It was the same blow that he had done before. The attack was just as large and impressive as the last, only this one had far more raw power to it. When the attack hit the space, it looked almost as if the space was moving inward, towards his attack, distorting the sky slightly. Still, he had gotten rid of the portals and the Divine beings in one area.

Then, with his other fist, he did the same, colouring the sky in dark red and mixes of yellow, getting rid of the Divine beings there as well. On his own, somehow Immortui was able to get rid of what looked like an entire army, at least in this place.

"That should do for now," Immortui stated. The serpents around Immortui unwrapped themselves and hovered above his shoulders again. "Now, it looks like it's time for me to head to the planet of the giants. Let's make a move!"

Turning around, Immortui could see, though, that Sil was right next to him, along with the Black Swordsman. The two of them hadn't given up, even though all of the clones had been defeated in the initial attack by the Divine Brigade.

'He just unleashed both of those powerful punches with the serpents!' Sil thought. 'Which means he had to have run out of energy.'

The glow in Sil's eyes was fading in and out; he couldn't use the foresight ability properly as his MC cells were running low.

Distracted by this, the serpents on Immortui's back both opened their mouths wide, and out from them, a powerful red aura exploded in a straight line. It hit the ground and was melting right through it. It went straight across from both of their mouths aiming to hit Sil. He could no longer move straight ahead and had to move back to avoid the attack. The Black Swordsman, though, had been ignored and continued to head forward.

It swung its sword at Immortui, who with his arm knocked it away and, with his other hand, delivered a blow right to its gut, lifting it in the air and piercing right through it. The Black Swordsman had disappeared from the single hit. Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

"If it's just one of you, things are a bit easier!" Immortui said, shifting his feet. He almost turned into the red mist himself. It looked like Immortui's body had turned into nothing but particles.

Sil was looking around; he could no longer see Immortui, but why did he feel that he was still there? Reappearing right next to him, somewhat like teleporting, the two serpents bit down, one holding onto his sword, while the other managed to bite down hard on his shoulder, holding him in place.

"Did you think I had shown you everything I had?" Immortui asked. "These serpents can produce just as much power as I can with my own hands, that's why, when I combine our power together, we can create quite the devastating blow," Immortui explained.

Russ' power was using too many MC cells, and Sil had to cancel the skill, concentrating on his own powers, but how would he get out of this situation? He couldn't teleport away, while Immortui was touching him, the two of them would teleport to the same place together.

In the palm of Immortui's hand, the colourless ability was activating, but he only allowed it to cover just the entire hand, and it didn't expand out more than that.

"You know, someone as strong as you, I would usually keep alive, so you could help me in my fight, but it looks like we have run out of time, and you are far too dangerous to keep alive."

Immortui moved his hand and placed it right into Sil's stomach. The colourless ball of aura that showed a world of just black and white moved from his palm and went right into Sil's body. Instantly, Sil could feel something happening, he didn't know quite what, but almost all feeling in that area had gone away.

"ARGHH!" Sil screamed, and the two of them teleported, moving to another location. This was going to be Sil's last stand against Immortui, and he would do everything in his power to help Quinn out as best as he could.
