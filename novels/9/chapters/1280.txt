Chapter 1281 - Not Your Friend

Something that Quinn had never thought about was the changes that happened each time Vincent would be in control over his body. The fluctuations in one's voice, the energy that surrounded them, the rhythm of their heartbeat and more, all would be determined by the person who was in control of a body.

The human mind was far more incredible than many might think, noticing those changes Eno could tell almost immediately that someone else had taken over Quinn's body. On top of that, the old vampire had also heard the words his 'grandson' had mumbled just before that.

Finally, when Vincent spoke, Eno was convinced that he wasn't Quinn.

"Tell me, what I need to do?" Vincent requested.

Sam and the others had already grouped up, ready to head off into their positions. They had decided to split up into four different groups covering each side of where the enemy would come from.

Linda, Wevil and Peter as one group, Sam, Nate and Layla as another, with Dennis and Fex as the third group. The fourth group would be the Blades, but judging by the fact they had yet to arrive at the top of the castle despite everything happening outside, they seemed to be busy‚Ä¶

'If they're still not here, it should mean that Vorden and Raten are still not done with their evolution and Borden must be staying by their side to guard them.' Sam thought, trying to think of a way to make up for the loss of the Blades.

'Wait, maybe Peter would be a good replacement, after all he has those two by his side.' But when Sam looked up, Peter was nowhere to be seen.

"Peter, where the hell is Peter?" Sam questioned, and realised that he had never come up with the rest. Now he had to come up with another idea.

Honestly he was worried that if they thinned out any of the three groups, especially with Peter gone, it would be too much for the groups to handle.

"I suggest, the three groups cover the East, West, and South sides." Sam spoke up. "At the moment, Mona is doing a great job stopping those at the North side, so we should be able to leave it be for now. Hopefully she can hold off long enough for the Blades to reinforce her."

If that wasn't the case, then Sam would have to try to act while on the ground, whichever group was doing best, they could shuffle one person to try and help.

"What about us?" Vincent asked. "What will the three of us be doing?"

"Us three, need to make sure that thing is under control and we will be staying by its side at all times." Brock answered looking down at the Dragon.

Vincent quickly understood. The enemy would have to send out their strongest members to deal with the Demon tier beast. Perhaps they would ignore the rest of the Cursed faction and head straight for the beast, which was why supposedly the three strongest members had been told to keep guard.

"I have a suggestion to make. I can help out with protecting the North side, the rest of you focus on covering your sides." Vincent spoke as he lifted his hand to open the Shadow space. Soon four Dalki could be seen appearing out in the open. The only thing was when they appeared they just stood there in place.

'Ah, right Quinn needs to control them.' Vincent thought. 'Well, he said he shares his vision with the Demon tier plant thing, so hopefully he can direct them where to go on the whole island, so I hope he can see this and come back soon.'

"Dalki!" Some of them shouted in surprise seeing the beast, even Eno looked a little bit shocked.

"I see, the boy has been really busy. What a powerful item he has at his disposal. Once again he has surpassed my expectations." Eno complimented the real Quinn, instead of the whoever was in his body.

"What about Sil?" Layla asked. "Can't Quinn travel to Alex with his shadow and get Sil?"

Sam shook his head, as he released the mistake he had made. He was so confident in the teleporters he thought something like this wouldn't have happened.

"Alex decided to head with Andrew to one of the Earthborn group planets. Apparently Andrew needed to create a few things for their group to help in the battle that was coming up, and Alex asked to go along. He has already done so much for us. I thought we could grant him this favour and help out Andrew. I don't know where he is at the moment. The only thing I can do is ask for someone in the Cursed ship to try and locate him and head back to the Cursed ship."

While Sam was delivering the news, It didn't take long for Quinn to notice the presence of the Dalki, so he switched with Vincent for a second, and gave the Dalki simple commands, to head just a little out into the north jungle, and to attack whatever came their way. Straight away the Dalki moved.

"I've sent the message, all we can do is wait, but we need to act as well." Sam said, and the rest of the groups were now moving.

Switching, control back, Vincent was in Quinn's body once again, and only the three of them now remained on the castle roof.

Vincent, was ready to act, to follow along with these two, but before he could take a step forward, Eno appeared in front of him with his blood armour and looked him directly in the eye.

"It's apparent that you're not Quinn, so tell me who you are? Why does it feel like I know you‚Ä¶ and you better make sure I like the answer!" Eno demanded.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Now in Full Control of the Roseus tree, Quinn could feel all of the beasts that had been marked over the island, and in the short time he had given it a command, he realised that it had done a far better job than he realised.

Quinn had an army of beasts at his disposal.

'Thank you for all dressing the same. You've just made my job a lot easier.' Quinn thought as he gave all the beasts a simple command, to attack the people who were wearing those strange black masks.

The beasts soon were seen coming out of the jungle, and onto the sand, jumping towards the people in black masks. Instantly, they attacked using their blood powers, throwing out their red aura. Some beasts were dealt with quickly, while others were strong enough to ignore the first barrage of attacks, charging into their opponents.

"What is going on? Why are all the beasts suddenly attacking us, this has never happened before!" One of the men shouted, as he punched to slice a beast in half with his red blood aura, but soon a strange thought had come out from one of the trees wrapping around his neck.

Just like with the amulet, Quinn was able to use his energy to strengthen the Marked. Instead of using his own energy, or the one of the tree that was already pretty tapped after taking control over so many beasts, the Vampire Lord had started to drain the lower tier beasts who were close to dying. Those that were higher tiers Quinn had decided to give this extra energy he had taken. Especially with more difficult opponents.

It seemed like there were vampires and humans at all different types of levels on the island.

Sam, Nate and Layla were the first ones to reach their position on the East side. It was not too far from where the Demon tier beast was, and they were meant to stick together. That's when Nate had spotted a masked person come out from the trees towards them.

Nate and Sam both were ready to use their blood powers and Layla also had readied an arrow, but soon they saw a gorilla-like beast jump towards the masked invader. The beast grabbed the poor man's legs from underneath pulling him onto the ground, and immediately with its large hands it started to pound at the masked man over and over until he was dead.

The gorilla beast looked at the three of them, and then quickly looked away heading back into the forest.

"What the hell was that? Did that beast just help us?" Nate asked, rubbing his eyes as if to check if something was wrong with them.

Layla was the only one who had an idea of what had possibly happened, and it looked like Wevil and Linda who had witnessed the same thing already had figured it out. After all, there was one thing on the island that should be able to control beasts aside from Mona.

"Does it actually belong to us this time, but how?" Wevil asked.

"I don't know, but if I was to guess, my bet is it's something to do with Quinn." Linda shrugged.

‚Äî‚Äî

After a brief conversation, Vincent, Brock and Eno jumped down from the castle, landing in the empty centre where the Demon tree, beast and tablet were.

"I see now‚Ä¶ so the tree was incomplete before. No wonder, I could tell that it would do us no harm. It looks like I was right to keep it here." Eno mumbled to himself, as he walked past the tree, and started to head towards the dragon.

As for Vincent, he still had complicated feelings when thinking about the conversation he just had with Eno.

'Quinn‚Ä¶ I'm sorry. I don't know what will happen after this fight, but I hope you can forgive me for telling him that. It was the only way to make him trust us‚Ä¶' G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

It was then, when Eno had taken one step too far that the Demon tier dragons beast had turned around, and looked towards the three of them. Its eyes stared at Eno, Brock and Vincent and it didn't look friendly at all.

"You three need to get out NOW! The Demon tier beast is no longer listening to me!" Somebody's voice shouted in all three of their heads at the same time.

Both Richard, and Brock didn't recognise the voice, but Vincent did. It was Ray's, and it appeared as the three of them were in for a far tougher job than they had signed up for.
