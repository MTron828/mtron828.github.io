Chapter 2539 ¬†The Final Choice

The vampire settlement was facing problem after problem, but with the backup of Logan, with the humans, his androids, and the help of the Vampire Corps unit, they were pushing back. A full-scale battle was taking place.

Vampires were running across the building tops, striking and releasing their blood aura across the sky. Abilities were being used to fire at the Divine beings, and helping out the most was Chris himself.

He had dived headfirst and took Peter along with him. He used Qi platforms to kick himself in the air, and with a single swipe, he continually was taking down Divine being after Divine being.

Peter couldn't hold back either, not if he wanted to defeat the Divine beings because they were anything but weak. A powerful hit would have to be directed at their heads or at the bulk of their bodies if he didn't want the godlike beings healing each other.

"There are so many of them!" Layla shouted. "Is it ever going to stop!"

Logan had come down from his ship and was on the ground next to Layla. He used his blaster hand to fire away at the Divine beings, knocking some of their spears, but his blaster was doing little to help the situation.

"You are right. By the looks of things, they are able to constantly reproduce. Rather than trying to get rid of them all, what we need to focus on is what is causing this and stopping it because we can't fight on forever, when it seems like they can."

Jumping up, Muka bashed both hands right on top of a Divine being that had come straight to attack them. It crashed into the ground at that point, and immediately the vampires and ability users around them piled their attacks on top of it.

"The issue is, how are we meant to find that out, when we're fighting with everything we have just to survive?" Muka stated.

It felt like the only choice they had was to continue fighting. The spears were going toward their enemy, and a group of the Dark Divine beings had gathered power at the tip of their spears, the power growing larger until it stopped.

They had frozen in place. The attacks from the vampires and the humans continued to hit the Divine beings for a short while, and suddenly they started to move away.

All of them were flying back toward the portals; they were retreating for some reason.

"Wait!" Muka shouted. "Don't chase; conserve your energy and try to help the injured!"

The Divine beings didn't look like beings that were alive anyway. It was useless to go after them, and the way they were retreating, it was almost as if an order had been given.

Layla, Logan, and Muka continued to look up, and when all of the Divine beings had gone back through the white portals, they had closed up, all of them. The entire settlement fell silent.

The people who had just been in a tough battle moments ago, all of it had ended like that, but they were still on edge. It didn't quite feel real, as if they would come back at any moment.

"What happened?" Layla asked.

"I think someone must have solved the root cause of our problem," Logan replied.

Despite all of that, were they safe? And even if they were, Layla was still worried about just what was happening to Quinn; where exactly was he?

Quinn had gathered a massive amount of his blood shadow into a form of a giant drill, using the blood around him, including that of Immortui himself. A blow that would be delivered and rip Immortui's body to shreds so that he couldn't harm another person he cared about again. But either out of desperation or part of his final plan, Immortui had some words to say.

"You have no clue, do you? You have no idea what will happen! What will happen if you kill me, if you do, you will lose everything!" Immortui said.

For a moment, Quinn hesitated as the blood shadow continued to spin rapidly, making a screech and pulsating with power in the sky, pushing apart all of the clouds in the area.

"I've caught your attention," Immortui claimed. "If you kill me, then my power will disappear from this world with it, and I mean all of my power. All of the demons that have been created, they will disappear.

"The power that you have right now, along with the rest of them, they will end up becoming nothing but humans! If that happens, do you think they would stand a fighting chance?"

Quinn grunted slightly. He wanted to believe it was a trick, but he remembered the words of Richard Eno and Vincent. Some of the smartest that he knew. They had come up with a theory that perhaps if they got rid of Immortui, then with him they would also get rid of their vampire selves, so he had reason to believe Immortui's word.

"But I can still get rid of you?" Quinn said. "You are the root of the problem to begin with." Upstodatee from n(0)/vùíÜ/lbIn/.(co/m

"Haha, and so what?" Immortui said. "You know that a celestial doesn't die unless his condition is taken over by another. Did you think my condition will be passed on to you? Unlikely, I will be born again, and I don't care how long it takes, I will make sure to come back."

"And you, and all of your friends you care about, have become a prime target for me. Without your powers that you have from me, you won't be able to beat me again."

"But if I get rid of you," Quinn replied. "If I get rid of you, at least we can have some sort of peace!"

"Peace?" Immortui laughed. "Peace, knowing full well that I will come back and get rid of you all someday. If you call that peace, then kill me now."

The words of Immortui, they were getting to Quinn. The speed of the drill started to slow down. What was he to do, how could he solve this situation?

"We won't let that happen," a voice said to his side.

When Quinn looked to see who it was, he could see three figures in front of him, and all of them he knew well.

"Mundus... Bliss and... Sam?" Quinn said.

Although they were in the red space, it looked as if there was an orb of white energy surrounding them that was protecting them.

"I'm sorry, Quinn, I tried my best to keep the celestials out of this whole event and I had somewhat failed, but things are okay now thanks to a certain someone," Mundus explained.

"Immortui was able to gather his strength over the course of thousands of years," Bliss explained. "Even if he reincarnates, his power will be close to back to normal. Even if he tries to raise his power again, we will be able to stop him this time before it grows.

"The only reason why he was so much trouble is because Immortui used to work with the gods. His sudden turn was unexpected, and he had grown too strong for the Ancient Ones to even kill him, but be sure that none of the celestials will ever let someone rise to that power again."

Hearing these words, Immortui's whole expression changed; he was no longer laughing because he knew that their words were true.

"And what about you, Quinn!" Immortui shouted. "When the Ancient Ones get rid of me, they will come after you, worried that you will do the same. Your fate will be the same as mine. Don't you see this is what I was trying to stop happening! If you get rid of me, then you will just have them as your enemy; they are not your allies."

Quinn didn't need to hear what Bliss and Mundus had to say; he knew they would state that this wouldn't happen, but he knew there was a very real chance of this happening.

"Quinn," Sam called out, standing straight and walking a little ahead of the other two by his side. "Forget what everyone said; this is your choice to make... you choose what you want to do, and I will support your decision whatever you make. I always have done so. Since the start of the Cursed Faction you have been my leader and will always be my leader."

"So Quinn... Choose what you want to do."
