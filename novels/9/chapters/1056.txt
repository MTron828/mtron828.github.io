Chapter 1057 - Working with a Demon

As expected, more people started to return to the shelter that were missing, and despite Ko‚Äôs orders to keep what happened into the faction base a secret. Word had gotten out to those in the Shelter as well. Rumors of a strange infection that took over peoples minds, making them attack anyone they could see.

Although the people were frightened by this, what it did do was stop them from asking questions about what happened to those returned. When they saw a group come back, now they had an idea why they were taken to the faction base.

However, the number of people that had returned was now over three hundred, and every single one of them had the mark on their body. Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"Ko, what are we going to do?" One of the Orbus faction members asked while in the main office. "We are holding onto a ticking time bomb. More and more will eventually come. I know that we still outnumber them even if they all were to come, but the fact that they can infect others as well."

"Don‚Äôt you think I know that?" Ko said, looking at the list of names of the people that returned, he looked through each of their names diligently, but it didn‚Äôt seem like he had found what he was looking for.

"Thank the stars we still have the Cursed faction," the man blurted out, but quickly regretted saying those words, as he saw Ko‚Äôs eyes twitching.

Still, Ko couldn‚Äôt get too angry at the man, even he had to admit so far they had been a great help in more ways than one. When one of the Marked had gone mad, Quinn would place them in his shadow lock.

At the same time, Fex would tie up some of them with the red string. It seemed like not all the Marked had the same strength compared to each other. Some could break from the string while others couldn‚Äôt.

Testing this, Quinn let out some of them from his shadow lock space, and allowed for Fex to tie the ones that were weaker up, giving him more room for his MC points, and to lock those that were potentially more dangerous.

Although, due to the sheer number of people being turned Quinn still was very low on MC points. Eventually, what they had predicted had come true as well, as one of the Faction members who had gotten bit, had been infected and turned into a mad Marked.

The idea was to capture him, so Hayley could study him, but it was impossible as the faction member was the strongest Marked they had come across by far. He had been wrapped in string that broke immediately, but Fex quickly overpowered him, hitting him a few times, before flipping him onto the ground.

Nowm he was one of those who were in Quinn‚Äôs shadow space. Then finally another problem occurred. Quinn no longer had any more MC points to use the shadow lock skill, at least he wouldn‚Äôt put anymore in as he wanted to keep some MC cells so he could still use the ability. Thankfully most of the ones that had progressed the furthest had already been put in his shadow lock so they had some time, but he had informed the others of this as well.

"Did you find out anything at all?" Quinn asked.

"Yes, but it‚Äôs not good news. There seems to be no relation on when someone disappeared and how far their marking has progressed since it depends on the individual. However, the main thing I have found, is for some reason those that have the marking passed on, the mark is spreading far quicker.

"In fact, it doesn‚Äôt make sense, but I can only assume that since they have come here, the markings on their bodies have been progressing at a rapid pace." Hayley explained.

It was a tough situation they were all in, and there was one option they did have but no one had suggested it so far. To kill all those that were infected. This would solve a number of problems, they didn‚Äôt have to worry about an attack from the Marked, they also didn‚Äôt have to worry about others being marked and it would give them more time to find the demon tier beast.

As for Quinn, due to everyone he was holding in his shadow lock, it meant he could no longer use his shadow abilities. Even if he was to face the demon tier beast, could he do it without his shadow abilities? The whole thing seemed a little impossible.

‚ÄôWe don‚Äôt have time, I have to find the demon tier beast today.‚Äô Quinn thought.

Looking around, all the faction members and even those from the Cursed were quite concerned. Quinn had already given them the orders that if it got too much, they were all to leave this planet.

They would have to give up on the people and give up on the idea of the Demon tier beast. He would protect them all from the Marked, as they got on the ship and flew out of there. Then using his powers he would travel to one of the shadow users on the Cursed ship.

The only person that seemed to be calm about the whole situation was Eno.

‚ÄôThat guy, does he know where the Demon tier beast is? Even if he did, I don‚Äôt think he would tell me? What am I missing?‚Äô Quinn thought.

Finding no answers, Quinn had no choice and he felt like he needed to go on a search. Robin had already decided that they would protect the place, and Ko wasn‚Äôt going to leave the shelter, which meant the Cursed were the only ones with free movement, but bringing along the others he couldn‚Äôt see how it would help too much.

The night sky was upon them, and as Quinn informed the others of what he was going to do, he decided to take investigating the missing people into his own hands. Fex was left behind with all the Marked, since his ability came in handy the most for restraining the others.

They had found a bit of a pattern with those who were stronger and weaker. It seemed to correlate with how strong the person was before the marking. Which was why Travelers and Faction members were the most dangerous.

With this, they could buy more time.

In the shelter, Quinn could see a lot had changed. They had built several walls between the gates of the Shelter, going towards the faction building where the giant pink tree was. In total there were now five walls surrounding them, and on these walls were the Graylash faction members.

At the same time, behind the faction building, a larger place was built that would keep the rest of the people who weren‚Äôt fighters and were unmarked inside.

Standing on top of the faction building, Quinn was looking out far and wide. People were still trickling into the shelter. He thought maybe he could try to follow them back. If he could locate where they were coming from, with his eyesight and hearing maybe he could track even more people further.

As he was looking out and waiting for someone to return to the faction, he heard some people exit from the building.

"Do you think this is a good idea, boss?" One of the men said.

"Do we have a choice? If I don‚Äôt do this, then this Shelter is doomed. I have protected it for this long and will continue to protect it." A voice said.

Hearing the voices, Quinn recognized it was two males, and he knew the other voice quite well. Hopping over to the back of the building, he could see that it was Ko, with one of the other Orbus leaders, and also two others were with them,

"They don‚Äôt look like faction members? They don‚Äôt even have any beast gear on. What is he planning to do?"

The other two that were with them, had brown robes over their heads, and were being held by the arm by Ko and the other Orbus leader. It looked almost like the two of them were captives. While walking, they looked around carefully, and Quinn continued to follow them from above.

It being their shelter, they knew all the secret paths, entrances and exits, until eventually they had exited from the shelter, and started to head into the woods.

‚ÄôNow what the hell is the Orbus faction doing?‚Äô Quinn thought, as he continued to follow them, deep into the woods.
