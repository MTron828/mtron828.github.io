Sil continued to look at the Dalki, he was unsure whether this was Hilston or not, whether he had somehow survived and had been turned by Jack, or some other force, but nonetheless it made him cautious.

Because an 8 Spiked Dalki, with a strong lighting ability was a completely different creature to begin with.

"I like your power, but I have a feeling that I am stronger." A large lightning bolt formed in H's hand. It condensed into a pure form rather quickly and was hurled towards one of the clones of Sil.

It was a powerful throw with a deadly ability. The clone of Sil tried to create a force field and so did the others that were around him but they were too slow to act. The shields had been brought up too late and the lightning had pierced right through one of the Sil's hearts.

After it made contact, the strike lit up and practically exploded, destroying the clone and hitting a few of the clones nearby. Although the clones were, in a way, just as powerful as Sil, they didn't seem to react as quickly as he did, nor could they take as much damage.

Either way, due to the powerful explosion, it had taken out a few of the other clones that were nearby. Sil turned his head as he thought this wasn't the end, and he was right, H had already moved from his position at a super speed and was in the centre of the clones.

The Dalki lifted both of its hands that were covered in lighting and slammed them on the floor. A lightning wave was sent out. Some of the Sil's leapt up into the air in time, including the real Sil, while the others were shocked and stunned into place.

"Do you think I would just let you do what you want!" Sil said, using the same lightning ability had created a type of whip, and as he threw it out, it wrapped around the arm of H. Using all of his power, he started to electrify H's body over and over, but it seemed to do nothing, as H started to spin around and his body was turning into a tornado of flames.

The fire was spreading out, taking out some of the clones nearby, but the ones further away switched to a water ability, and fired at the tornado of flames extinguishing it rather quickly. However, they could no longer see H in the tornado of flames, and another clone of Sil's felt the back of his head being crushed by the pure power of H.

'This is more difficult than I thought. He can use more than one ability, so no doubt this is the power of the Blades but an 8 Spiked Dalki already has speed to keep up with the clones using the super speed, but with this Dalki using the powers, he is far faster than I thought.

'My powers are stronger, if we were to go head to head with just abilities, but not strong enough to finish him off... but I have to try.' Sil thought.

Landing on the ground, Sil made his intentions clear as he started to use the earth ability to summon a box, right around H. Soon all the other clones that were still there, were also using the earth ability to do the same thing. Earth was being condensed on top of earth, making it as hard as possible.

It was being condensed and they were attempting to crush H, as they pushed it further and further in. Sweat was running down the clones' faces as they could feel that H was trying to get out.

With each large punch, the whole planet felt like it was shaking, but they continued to push the walls. Trying to suffocate him, to get rid of him and condensing the Dalki down. The vibrations soon stopped though, and that meant that H was no longer trying to punch the wall.

However, a moment later a loud bang was heard and the cube of dirt, that had been heavily condensed, had cracked and eventually a large hole had broken through. The planet felt off balance, making everyone fall over.

From the giant earth cube, pieces could be seen falling as the Dalki figure had come out, with blood dripping over all different parts of its body. Based on the wounds, they looked to have been self inflicted.

"I don't think anyone has pushed me this far... although I still don't feel as if I'm in danger."

The wounds on his body were starting to heal, they were self-regenerating at a fast speed, and H looked to be just as strong as before.

Shiro, who was watching the fight from the side, was wondering what they could do.

'Is it possible to win this fight?' Shiro thought. 'The power of the Dalki, and I can sense it, although I'm not the best when it comes to Qi, there is a strong Qi that is powering through that Dalki's body.

'He must have used his super speed to throw out a punch, switching to a super strength and along with injuring himself and the Qi, he was able to break out even with the multiple Sil's overpowering him with abilities. This is just a freak of nature, and one that is able to heal at that.'

Sil was down to around half his clones, there were still a lot of them, but the pressure was weighing on his mind. After all this time, the pressure of H possibly being Hilston was still there.

Seeing how it felt like nothing was working at the moment, even though Sil still had the advantage, it was making him lose hope, even though he still hadn't tried everything he had. There were multiple abilities, including his foresight ability, but maybe that was part of the problem.

'If I attack him with my demon tier weapons, he'll block them and attack, sacrificing his arm and hit me right in the stomach. If I use all the other Sil's to concentrate their abilities directly on him and he uses a Qi blast to create a small shield, then he will use the speed ability to get directly in my face causing another one to one battle.'

"There has to be a way!" Sil thought, as he opened up his book. He was changing abilities, while using his foresight ability. Going through all the motions of what he could do to win this battle. With each ability he was going over a different strategy and seeing what would work.

From what he had seen so far with the foresight ability, the problem was so far that Sil would lose the fight if he himself got close, in a physical battle.

'For now I'm going to have to buy time.'

Opening up a portal, Sil allowed for the remainder of his clones to now use the weapons the other Blades were using so far.¬† Using the super speed ability and the demon tier weapon at the same time, they would try to buy time.

If they hurt H too much, then it would only make him stronger. A battle was occurring of explosions, and H going all over the place, using his raw power as he punched, kicked, and did all sorts, while the real Sil's eyes were slightly hollow, looking through his book of abilities.

'Not that one... that one won't work as well. There has to be a way to beat him.' Sil was focused, looking at the after images of what he could do, and in a way was ignoring what was happening in the real battle around him.

To the point where he didn't realise that H had decided to go for him rather than continue dealing with the clones. There were a few large wounds on his body, making him just move faster, and Sil was just standing there still trying to find a way, but there was one that stood in the way, as he came from the side and grabbed right onto H's arm, stopping him in his tracks.

"It took me a while to get used to your timing... but I managed to do it." Borden said with a smile, holding the arm, his whole body was shaking as he was using every muscle fibre he had.

"You... are like me, so why are you stopping me?" H asked.

"Are you an idiot... because that guy behind me is my brother... and when he's ready, he's going to kick your arse."

H for the first time since the fight started smiling, strength started to go out from the Dalki, and was now draining into his own body as they both touched. Borden didn't know why, but he was suddenly feeling weaker.

Borden went and used his other hand to try and separate the two of them, but he was stuck and getting weaker by the second. With the other hand, H now had it covered in intense flames.

"It's too bad that you won't be able to see your dear brother kick my arse." H said, as he placed the hand right on Borden's face, melting it in an instant and his arms losing power and falling by his side.
