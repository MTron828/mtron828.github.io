Chapter 2340  A friend turning

Muka, who would usually be reading reports, calling meetings and discussing with other leaders how to improve life in the vampire settlement, had put all that on pause. After learning of what Quinn had told her, she was unable to stop pacing back and forth.

"I thought Peter was troublesome and the one to worry about, but now he goes ahead and drops this bomb on me?" Muka thought.

Thinking back, Quinn did always do things first, Peter was just a worse version of him. Perhaps because the two spent a lot of time with each other, meant the two had rubbed off on each other.

'Who am I kidding, both of them are trouble, but there is something about Quinn. Maybe it's the fact that he can do these things so fearlessly that attracts people around him.'

Looking around her room, she saw the old helmet that she used to wear that would cover up her entire head. For a while, not many even knew that Muka was a female leader, nor did they know of her beauty.

She had covered herself up due to all the attention she would get, but had done so less and less as time went on. The significance of the leaders and their duties in the settlement lessened, so she tried her best to take herself less seriously but it was a hard habit to kick.

The helmet had since been altered, not being as bulky as it was before, but still covered the entire face allowing for only the eyes and mouth to be seen. It was placed on a stand, like one would use to hold their wigs. Taking it off, she placed the mask on and headed outside, she needed some air to take in everything.

While walking down the streets of the vampire settlement, there were still some that would turn to look at her. It wasn't because they recognised her, but due to the beauty that would still shine with just her eyes and lips alone showing.

They were so alluring that if a person stared into them for a short while, they would be hypnotised into doing anything Muka asked them, she just wished that this would work on Quinn, then she would be able to tell him how she felt.

Suddenly, she stopped, dead centre. Other vampires had to walk around her, and were giving her strange looks, as she appeared to be a person that was lost.

'The person I feel so bad for in all of this, is Layla.' Muka thought. 'She will know nothing of what is happening, and she is to raise two kids. They hardly spent any time with their father, will they be okay? Sure, I can do my best, everyone in the settlement can help out, but I know things won't feel the same.'

She soon felt her legs walking toward the location where Layla was at, she was moving because she had planned to go against Quinn's words. She was going to tell Layla and let her decide. Usually Muka wouldn't dare go against Quinn, but if she was in the same position as Layla, she knew that she would have wanted to know.

In the middle of her walk, there was a disturbance that was coming from her right. Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Its arms were like two giant drills and even its head was shaped like a drill with two white spots for "Help… help, it's gone out of control!" A vampire shouted, as he ran out his front door and onto the street. His clothes were ripped, they were bloody, several marks were on his face, and he was so startled that he stumbled on the floor.

Following right behind, coming out from the door, there was a floating creature. It had no legs, but almost looked like the upper half of a human body. Although apart from its limbs and torso, nothing else looked human.

Its arms were like two giant drills and even its head was shaped like a drill with two white spots for eyes.

'It's a familiar… is it trying to kill its owner?'

The man swung his arm, letting out a blood swipe, it hit the familiar sending it back, and it had turned into black mist. It looked like a crisis was averted and there was no need for Muka to do anything.

Before, only strong vampires were able to link up with familiers, due to their short nature. If they didn't like their host, then familiars would often attempt to kill their host. In turn this would get rid of the familiar as well, as they had broken a contract.

They were strange things, but if whatever reason they joined a person in the first place, if that person strayed from this, or they no longer felt the same way, then this would often be the result, but Muka thought back to the reports.

It had been a while, but for some reason, familiars were appearing less and less in their world. In the first place, the area where the familiars would appear was the old vampire settlement and not the current one, but there would still be those that would journey and try to get one.

Regardless, these days, there seemed to be fewer and fewer familiars willing to join, ever since the dhampir incident.

While thinking of all of this, a black mist started to appear from the vampire man's hands, the familiar was appearing again.

"No… no! Someone help me!" The man screamed at the top of his lungs.

'That familiar, it's appearing again!' Muka thought. 'But that's so soon, it shouldn't have enough energy to appear again.'

Just like the vampire man and Muka feared, the familiar had appeared again. Seeing this situation, she ran across and grabbed the familiar right by the head. The vampire aura was strong in the palm of her hand.

"I know you things can understand me, if you appear and disturb this man again and again, then it will just be the same result. I will make sure you feel pain." Making her aura erupt, it engulfed the familiar and it turned into nothing but black mist again.

She looked at the vampire on the ground, something was strange about the situation. The vampire was strong enough to deal with the familiar, so he was stronger than it, but why was he covered in wounds, why did he look exhausted, just how many times had he gone against that familiar.

For some reason, Muka felt like something was up, she helped the vampire up, off the ground.

"I think it's best if you go with me."

Heading back to her castle, she asked for reports to be gathered on familiars and other things. She needed to see a link. Apparently this wasn't the first case, there had been reports of quite a few familiars attacking their owners.

They had risen sharply after the vampire and dhampir incidents.

'Did many of the dhampirs have familiars?' Muka started to think. 'We have learned that the familiars feed off Qi energy. Vampires don't have much Qi energy in the first place. However, the vampire settlement happened to be in a palace where familiars were welcomed… and thanks to the rituals by Richard Eno, he had a way for us to connect to the other world and form contracts with them.

'However, dhampirs and humans have more Qi energy than us. It was almost as if vampires were gatekeeping this fact from them. Is that why they are acting up… I'm really not sure, and how can I even look into this matter if that's the case.' Muka thought.

Walking in through the door without even a knock was Quinn, or at least the person who was acting like Quinn. For a moment she was excited thinking she could ask him for help, but Peter, what could he do?

"You look troubled, is there anything you need me to beat up?" Peter asked.

At that moment, a deafening alarm and alert had been sounded throughout the whole settlement. The alarm was put in place, for when there was big trouble on the way.
