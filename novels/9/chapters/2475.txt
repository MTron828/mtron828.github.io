Looking at Arthur's back, it only took a moment for all the memories to come flooding to Quinn. His confident voice, his long black hair, and the fact that he could use the shadow. It had been a long time, an incredibly long time, since he had seen him. 

That of course, was when reality had somewhat hit Quinn. That had to be the case, because these were all of the dead that were related to Quinn. Not just the ones he killed with his own hands, but those that he still had a deep thought in his mind about. 

In fact, it was only now that he was realising it, even though the crowds of people that had surrounded him, not all of them were attacking him. They just were unable to do anything to help.

Several attacks came flying their way and lifting his hand up, a shadow wall was created, blocking them all. Moving it back down, the shadow wall had disappeared and now Arthur was just smiling as he looked at the faces of all of those that still had a lot of resentment left in them. 

"Look at all of you, the whole lot of you are already dead. You causing harm to him will do nothing for you." Arthur stated. "So rather than just passing on your pain and be done, you want to torture him. All of you should be blaming yourselves for the situation you are in." 

Arthur's words weren't going to get through to them. One could tell by the unchanged look on their faces, and if anything, it looked like they were more annoyed by the situation. 

"The original Punisher, the cause of many, many misfortunes." Bryce said. "Of course you would be the one to stand on that side, but do you really think just one of you is enough? That boy can't fight himself, and in the end you will have to pass on your pain to him as well."

Arthur couldn't help but laugh at the situation he was in. His shoulders were shaking. In some ways when he passed on, he was happy that he didn't have to deal with this anymore, and now he was put in this situation. 

"Quinn." Arthur called out. "Look at all these people, it looks like you have been incredibly busy after me, did you even have time to rest?" 

Seeing Arthur in this way, acting like this, it was hard for Quinn, making his chest feel heavy.  When he had originally met Arthur, he was a figure to follow, a person to admire who was strong and helped Quinn in many ways. 

Teaching him, protecting him, and overall looking out for him. However, the last moments spent with Arthur weren't the best memories that he had of him. That was until the very end, when he made a switch at the last moment, giving himself up, and passing on all of his powers to Quinn, trying to help him the best way he could, and now even after death Arthur was protecting him once again, and he was acting more like the better days of the Arthur he knew. 

"Alright let's make this clear then." Arthur shouted. "I will get rid of everyone who is not on this side. So you should choose if you want to pass on peacefully or not."

It seemed foolish in this type of situation to suggest such a thing. Sure Arthur was strong, perhaps stronger than Bryce, and maybe enough to take on Bryce and Cindy, but what about the rest, including the Dalki that he was scared of at the time

"Oh and I'll let you in on one more thing, did you think out of everyone that passed, that I would be the only one that wanted to protect this kid?"

So focused on Arthur in front of him, he had failed to notice the others that took a step forward and were now in front of him as well. Quinn tossed and turned his head, as he looked at all of the smiles they gave back to him. 

For him, how long had it been since he felt this way, he was trying his hardest to swallow the lumps that were coming up in his throat, but eventually he lifted his head up. 

"I thought… I would never see you guys again." 

One of the most notable ones that had appeared, was the blind bald headed teacher of his that had guided him through ups and downs, Leo Suiyan. During his slumber, Leo had passed away. Never giving the chance for Quinn to thank him, or to say goodbye.

However, there was one by his side, and it was nice to see that the two were now standing side by side, next to each other. That was Erin Heley. She was standing comfortably next to Leo and her smile showed she was happy.

Having to defeat her with his own hands and only later finding out the real person behind everything. It was painful for Quinn and Layla, who would often tell stories of the time the two had been together. 

Then, there were the members of the cursed faction, the group Quinn had created that had taken him through everything. Nate Snell, a man who had challenged him in the VR game, a talented student who was strong headed and was loyal to the end. 

Dennis was also by his side. One that had originally come from another group, but helped Quinn out to the point he had even learned the shadow power as well. 

Lastly there was Wevil who was by Linda's side as well. Wevil was one of the starting members of the cursed faction, sacrificing himself on Blade island in order to help the rest. 

It was hard for Linda to recover from Wevil's death, but at some point during his 1000 year slumber she had to have passed away, and now the two were back together happily again

"The deceased members of the cursed faction going up against all the enemies you already beat huh?" Wevil commented. "Man, did you have to give us such a hard job on our first day back." 

Linda proceeded to punch Wevil on the side of his shoulder. 

"Don't worry about him, Quinn. We came because we saw you were in trouble, we saw you needed us. If anything, it's great that we can see you again."

"Don't worry, we have some more allies that came before us, that are among the others." Leo commented. "I can sense their aura." 

"We are your past Quinn." Erin said. "You have a future, the whole world has a future, and knowing you, you're probably in this situation because you're trying to save the world or something. So go and save the world." 

Stretching out her hand, a large sword formed in its place. 

"Save the world, while we go and save you."
