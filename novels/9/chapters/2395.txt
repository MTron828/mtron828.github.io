The summoned Celestial had brought back memories for Chris. There was a part of him that wished to face it again, so he could see whether or not it was something he could defeat on his own. One thing that was a habit for him that he never stopped, was trying to make his body stronger.

In a way, for his own mental health, it was the only thing that was driving him in this current world.

Last time, they needed the help of many others. Yet, he had to let it be, as it was to go against the one that was named the champion.

Russ, was the one who was to give orders to his creation, and he could tell it was relatively strong, based on the amount of MC cells it had taken him to summon such a thing.

'If this guy loses, then it looks like we might have quite the conundrum on our hands.' Russ thought, but didn't say this out loud and allowed for the two-bladed Chrono to make its way up the stairs.

"I really want to watch, but we are just going to have to stay here from a distance." Chris said, trying to focus on his hearing.

Walking up the stairs, the Chrono Russ had created took a step at a time. Slowly it climbed the staircase that seemed to be at least a hundred steps high, until finally it had reached a level flooring.

It still had yet to leave the building, but now there were far taller ceilings and hallways that seemingly led off to different directions, but before all of that was another Chrono at the other end.

Only this one looked completely different to the others. It had the same facial features with the trunk-like eyes that curled outward and the same dark grey skin. However, it was far more muscular than the others.

It wore a vest piece like armour, that covered its entire chest but allowed its arms to be on display. The shoulders were rounded and muscular which matched the rest of its body.Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

On the floor itself there were several pillars that were covered in blood, that included the floor as well, with body pieces that were left to rot. Bones that had been there for who knows how long.

Strangely though, although the blood was splattered all over the place, the bones and pieces of flesh were put to one side.

"It's been a long time since someone has decided to climb those stairs. Usually only when a group of newcomers come in, someone tries to climb." The champion said, lifting his head and coming off from the wall he was leaning on. A pair of large axes could be seen on his back.

When he saw who was in front of him, he soon stopped, his hands were still by his side and slightly shaking at who he could see.

"Hinto‚Ä¶is it really you?" The man known as the champion said. "It has to be you, you recognise me right, it's me Shinto... don't you recognise me, brother?"

The person who Russ had pulled from Chris's imagination was Hinto, a celestial that worked for Mundus and the celestials. Originally, Hinto was a Chrono and was from this world, the world that was called the Red space.

The different planes and worlds had names, the Red space was where they currently were at, then there was the Mystic space, where the familiars resided and there was Earth, it was known as the Golden space.

This was mostly due to Celestials wishing to work with planets in this particular space due to the abundance of life that could be seen through the universe, which helped them complete their conditions a lot easier.

Whereas the Red space and Mystic space, got their names due to different reasons. Hinto was originally from the Red space, and had quite the reputation in the Red space.

He was one of the strongest fighters, but eventually ended up on the run from Immortui after killing several demons in a significant skirmish. Because of this, he had been recruited by one of the ancient ones. Those in the Red Space were unaware of this and assumed Hinto was still in hiding or had been killed.

"Why aren't you saying anything, don't you recognize me after all this time, or have they done something to you!" Shinto demanded, his voice turning desperate. He glanced left and right, as if expecting someone might overhear him.

This was an opportunity for Shinto. With his brother, perhaps they could oppose Immortui or the Demon King.I think you should take a look at

"Hinto... I've grown stronger, much stronger. After you left, I thought they had killed you. So I decided to fight against them. I fought against Immortui and his demons, but in the end, it wasn't enough, I was unable to beat him and was assigned here to guard this place.

"But I haven't neglected training, I've been striving to grow stronger each day. With the two of us, we can do something, please Hinto, remember!"

Both Chris and Hikel stood at the bottom of the staircase, listening to the conversation above. Even Russ had transformed part of his ears to resemble a vampire's so he could hear better.

"This has turned into a very interesting turn of events," Chris observed. "I knew they looked like each other. Is there a way we can use this to our advantage, can we pretend that's the real Hinto and trick him?"

"I'm afraid not," Russ replied. "If I were directly controlling them, I could speak through them, but it would still just be me. I think they would quickly realize something was amiss. Our best chance is to try to kill him while he thinks we're his brother.

"Otherwise, sooner or later, he will find out that something is wrong."

Hikel and Chris weren't so sure. It was a chance to gain a powerful ally, but ultimately, Chris was part of the group that actually killed his brother. If this truth came out, they would face the wrath of this champion, and they still had no idea just how strong they were.

"Screw it, I'm doing it," Russ declared.

The command was given, and now Hinto was walking towards his brother, swords still clenched in his hands.

"Hinto!" Shinto called. "Hinto!"

He shouted his name, but the lack of response was causing him concern, and he reached to draw his axes.

"I knew it, they must have done something to you, damn it, why did it have to come to this. If you are as skilled as you were back then, I'm afraid I won't be able to hold back without killing you, otherwise I would lose my own life."

Just then, before a grand battle could begin, a large bell tolled, resonating through the lower floors. The sound echoed off the walls and was piercing to all of their ears.

"The sun... has set," Shinto stated.

Inside, all the other Chronos began to rise... the hell was about to commence.
