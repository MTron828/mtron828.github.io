It was clear from the look in Chris' eyes, that if he could have his way he would have continued to hunt the Yak getting stronger. Although he wouldn't do so in a way that would get him caught, eventually his actions would lead him to getting him caught. 

"Hey." Edvard called out. "I know we need to get stronger, these guys, even these demons, would give trouble to our vampire knights. So I understand what you're going through right now, but it's just too dangerous to get caught.

"Now is not the right time, we need to be careful." 

Chris having cleared up what parts of the body he couldn't eat, and burying them deep in the ground like a dog does its favourite toys, the two of them headed off, and were returning to the cave. 

They scaled the outside of the mountain, off to the side of the cave. If one had good eyesight from a distance, the two didn't want to be spotted, and although they could jump down and not get hurt, jumping up in one go would be difficult.

After scaling the mountain for a while, the two were a little curious to know if anything had happened. They had been gone for a decent amount of time after all.

"What the… who are they?" Chris asked. "Why are there… monsters, demons in here, I don't know what to call them." 

The ones Chris were referring to were the Skullys… Anon, and the others. They were chatting away playing some sort of game in the dirt with each other. 

"It's a bit of a long story." Hikel said. "But as you can see, they aren't our enemy, and there is quite a bit going on." 

"I guess that will explain to us where Sil went as well?" Edvard asked. 

The cave wasn't large in the first place, so they would have seen SIl, yet he was nowhere to be found. 

"He's gone to get us some allies." Hikel replied. "As I said, there's quite a bit to unwrap. It looks like all of us might need to get ready to move, and be ready for battle again." 

While Hikel was catching the two up on what had happened while the others were away, Sil and Calva were journeying together. He had changed his abilities to include that of telepathy and teleportation. 

He knew where the cave was, after exploring the outside area a bit, he was confident even if they had travelled a great distance he would be able to take the two back to where they were, and in case the two of them would run into any trouble they would be able to inform the others. 

The two had gone quite far away from the cave but were still stuck inside the large mystic forest, Calva was looking at a few of the surroundings while also getting up a high point to see where they were. 

'None of the clones that I sent out earlier have been defeated by Immortui yet.' Sil thought, as he was quickly checking in on them. 'This makes me feel more uneasy though. If he isn't trying to chase after Quinn, what is he doing?' 

Calva after a while jumped down, landing in front of Sil. 

"I think we should head in that direction." Calva pointed. 

"You think?" Sil replied. 

"I apologise, although I have been on this planet before, a lot has changed, and I don't know every single detail or location. I was confident that if we found Pultra, that I could convince her." 

"If you don't know where she is, how are you confident in finding her?" Sil asked. 

"When the champions lost to Immortui, we were given a choice, to follow him, helping him with his goal, or to accept death. Out of all of us, there were two that chose death and I was one of them.." 

Sil teleported the two of them to the next location. The forest was changing slightly, as the trees were getting smaller. Giving them less cover, they would have to be more careful from now on. 

Still, while Calva moved, Sil made sure to follow behind as he continued to listen to his story. 

"As you can see, Immortui didn't kill me. Instead he had chained me up while he forced my kind into a hunting game." Calva explained. "It was his way of trying to convince me to go to his side. 

"You see, the other person who had chosen death was Pultra."

Calva pointed again, and this time it was to a type of civilization. There were countless temples on the ground with wide roads, and the Yaks could be seen coming back and forth carrying large materials. 

It was a village of giants that were working hard. Going through the town was a river of water. It would have been large for humans, but the Yaks were able to just jump over the river. 

What was interesting, was if you were to follow the river, it would come to a large cliff, where the water fell from above. It was a waterfall, and on top of the waterfall was a golden temple.

"I'll explain the rest before we go in further as we will need to keep quiet." Calva said. "Pultra was the first of the champions to fall to Immortui. At the time, information was being spread by the inhabitants, so we had a good idea of what was going on. 

"Now that I think about it, word was perhaps being spread by Immortui on purpose so we knew what was to come. When she had lost, she had rejected his offer, and the word was, he had forced something upon her. All we know is that the red energy in the air swirled from all over after the fight. 

"Then a few days later, Pultra had changed her mind, accepting to work with Immortui.

"I'm not sure if what happened to her is what Quinn is going through now. I don't know why Immortui never used such a thing on me, but if the two of them are going through the same thing, it will help us a great deal." 

It made sense, and Sil was happy to know that Calva was actually thinking about the reason behind his decision other than just because they were currently on the planet. With his powers, it didn't matter too much where they started. 

"You've explained a lot, but you still haven't explained how you would know where she is?" Sil asked. 

Calva smiled. 

"Pultra, like Shinto, is working for them, so they won't technically be locked up like he was. However, the Champions won't be allowed freedom. I heard from the others he had been given a post as a guard. 

"For Pultra, I imagine they couldn't let her power go to waste, while keeping a close eye on her." 

Using his teleportation powers they entered the city, and Sil made sure they stayed behind large buildings as they observed the area around them. Calva still seemed to be looking for something. 

Unable to find it, he asked Sil to continue teleporting around, again, again and again. Through the city, they were unable to find what they were looking for. 

"We haven't tried up there." Sil suggested, looking at the golden palace.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

"I wanted to avoid that place as much as possible. Can you see how the red mist is slightly thicker up by the castle. It's not because it's high up. What that means, is that it's most likely where the demon king is." 

If Sil was to take a guess, he would have picked the giant golden temple as well for the demon king to reside in, but it also made sense that they would want to keep the champion close. 

Sil teleported the two up there, as long as they were at the foot of the giant temple and not inside it, he thought they would be alright. Then he started to move them around the giant temple, until Calva shouted "Stop!" As he looked at what was behind it. 

"This is it, this is where she will be." Calva exclaimed. 

From the temple's side, one could stare down the waterfall, and look at the village of the Yaks. When looking at the other side, it wasn't another stream of water, water was being brought upward from down below. 

They were looking at a giant hole, similar to a canyon of greenery, but Sil couldn't stop staring at the water that was moving up. Being pushed up against the side of the whole wall. 

"This makes no sense." Sil said. 

"Trust me, things might start to make a lot less sense." Calva said. "But the good news is… she's definitely down there somewhere."
