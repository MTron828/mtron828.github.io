There were more people than Quinn could even see now in the strange space. Even if he was able to use the full extent of his powers, with past enemies, even Graham here, there was a good chance he couldn't beat them. 

What he was about to experience was the worst in all of his life. However, he was unaware of why this was happening. In this special space that Immortui placed people in, they were meant to deal with the situation one at a time, it was how it was meant to work. 

A process that would take Quinn days to get through. The reason for them all appearing, was due to what was happening on the outside of his body. Pultra's natural effect was speeding up the process. 

In turn, it had put Quinn in a tough situation. One that not a single person had experienced before, what the results would be of such a thing, were unknown. 

——

Outside of Quinn's body, Sil had just informed everyone that Immortui had taken out one of the clones he had spread out far and wide. 

"Wait, does this mean he's found us?" Calva asked. 

"No." Sil answered. "But I know a couple of things. Each of the clones have a teleportation ability. If they were to see him they were to move away. I predicted that this might have been the reason he has been taking so long. 

"However, the clone was taken out without having any time to even send me a message. So he had to have been killed instantly."

Sil's clones were extremely powerful for a few reasons. At the time they were created by Sil, they had the same amount of MC cells. So the powers they could use were great and large.  They also had the abailties of the Sil when he was created but they were unable to change them due to not having a soul weapon. The other downside was if they were hit with a hard blow they would disappear. 

So this was the thing that was worrying Sil, they had strong powers and hadn't been able to even put up a fight?

'Is it because he's using his colourless power. Does it also stop my abilities? The champions told me about it. Then the best way to face him would be from a distance.'

"What does this mean for the plan?" Chris said. 

In this situation no one had an answer, and instead it looked like they were waiting for Sil to give an answer. That was until he had made a few more noises. 

"No… no… no." He mumbled as he looked up at the others. "He just took out another one." 

Sil's words had more weight than they imagined. If the clones were spread far apart and he had taken them out in succession like so, he was clearly now actively searching for them and had a way to get from one to the next fairly quickly. 

"There's a chance he might have found a way to track you, or he's just going planet to planet." Shinto said. "If it continues like this, he'll be here soon." 

"Quinn still isn't awake though." Hikel satted. "And we have yet to get the blood that he needs. Let's say he does wake up, without that blood, will he be able to beat Immortui?" 

It was a question that they didn't know the answer to. 

"I have no choice." Sil said, his hand shaking. "I said this before, if Immortui is on our tail then I will go face him, I will have to buy us some time." 

"But you were part of our plan?" Chris said. "Weren't you going to alter their memories to make it easier for us?" 

"I know." Sil said. "I would have created a clone and given you its power, but it seems for some reason, the clones can't use that power. I don't know why, but maybe Russ can. Either way, right now Immortui is the more dangerous threat. In order for this to work, I need to go to him. I'm sorry guys." 

Sil didn't even give a chance for the others to say anything, time was running out. There might be a way for him to use his clones to distract Immortui, so he could fight him on the outside. He teleported out of the cave, ready to face the hardest fight of his life. 

"So can you do it?" Hikel asked. "Will you be able to use Sil's power?" 

"I have an idea of how it works… but it might be difficult depending on the situation. I don't have as many MC cells as that guy. I can't just teleport around the place, and using powers like that, for me it takes up more MC cells than the original."  Russ explained. 

"Either way, things have stayed the same, we have to get rid of the demon kings, we can't waste any more time. We'll get the blood, Russ you teleport us to the location of all the demon kings and we'll do this." 

The group moved to the edge of the cave ready to move out, but that's when they noticed that not everyone had come with them. Instead, still standing in the cave were the three champions that had just agreed to help them. All three were looking at each other. 

"You guys can defeat the demon king without us." Calva said. 

"What is this crap, are you flaking on us right now, of all times?" Russ shouted, wanting to blast them all away. They were just a big waste of time. 

"It's not that." Shinto interrupted. "It's the best use of our time and all of our skills. You guys are strong and if anything we're trusting that you're enough to take on the demon king, but for us we can help in other ways." 

Pultra at the back nodded. 

"We know our role in all of this." Pultra said. "For one, I need to stay by Quinn's side for my powers to help him. On top of that, there is always a chance that he will be discovered. Someone needs to protect him and one is not enough. 

"I know you wish that to be you, but all of you are needed more than us. And lastly, when Quinn wakes up, we wish to train him. 

"We, who had all fought against Immortui, we wish to see his skills, his power, and see what he has to beat Immortui, meanwhile, also teaching him everything we know about the one we need to face. 

"I know it sounds selfish of us, but I feel like Quinn is our only chance of actually beating Immortui. So we need to do everything we can to make sure he can win." 

Hikel stared dead into Pultra's eyes for a few moments, until he had finally made a decision. 

"Very well, Peter, you can put your fist down. Save it for the demon king. Let's go get the Yak demon king's blood!" Hikel jumped down and the rest followed straight after.  L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
