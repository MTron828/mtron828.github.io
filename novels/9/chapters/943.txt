Chapter 944 - A warning to you all

Finally, after everything Quinn had been through, everything he had done. It felt like for the first time, things were going his way. Although, he still felt like Bryce was up to something, because at this point it felt like he couldn’t trust any of the vampires after what had happened. Just like Dwight had warned him. In the end, he did get everything he had requested.

’It looks like we can finally get ba-’ Quinn thought as he was about to slump back into his chair, but of course, there had to be an outburst.

"This shouldn’t be something that should have even been voted on!" Suzan complained. "How can a leader have so much freedom compared to the other leaders? Shouldn’t we all be treated as equals? We didn’t even bring up anything about the changes he had made to his castle and castle walls."

Due to the many concerns that the leaders had from Bryce’s announcements, they had forgotten about this matter, and it was something each of them would like to discuss as well.

"First off, Quinn as someone who has protected this settlement does now have special rights, without him most of us, if not all of us would be dead." Bryce stated. "The council and you arguing, wouldn’t even exist. Just as Tempus said as well, even if we wanted him to stay, clearly Quinn does not, but if you wish to stop him, then go right ahead."

Thinking about this, Suzan knew she wouldn’t be able to match up to Quinn. Maybe through a surprise attack of some sort if she could get a few needles in, but not in a duel where he was prepared. His shadow skills were just too strong.

Reluctantly, she had to give up.

"I will speak to all you leaders together." Said Bryce. "It’s clear the room is divided with the decision but let me ask you. Is it the fact that you think Quinn as the Tenth leader is needed for the settlement that you are annoyed he is leaving, or the fact that he is a leader that is getting special privileges that you dislike. Because if it is the latter, then you are not thinking about what is best for the settlement."

Bryce’s words had hit some of them hard as they realised that they were just being selfish. Seeing Quinn’s strength they should have wanted him to stay to make the vampires stronger, but that wasn’t the case at all.

"As for the second matter you brought up, I am quite interested in this as well. Quinn, we saw how effective your towers were and now it seems your defences have improved even further. I am fine with each leader keeping some extra resources or powers for themselves, but I believe this is something that could be shared with all the vampires as a whole." Bryce requested

This was something else Quinn was expecting, after seeing what his system could do and the upgrades he had made, Bryce would want it for the rest of the castles as well. However, even if Quinn wanted to help, he couldn’t.

The titles he had received made it so he could only build things within a certain area, and for now that area was only within the castle.

’Maybe if I completed the quest to become a King I would get a new title. One that would open up the whole area. Sure, I’ll build it all for you, but you have to let me become King. Yeah, that wouldn’t go down too well.’ Quinn thought.

"Unfortunately, it is something I can’t do. The things that happened to the tenth castle. It was due to the past Tenth leader’s ability and not mine. Left behind by Vincent. I just activated them for defensive measures but there is no way for it to be used in other places. As all resources have been used up." Quinn said, shifting the blame onto Vincent for once.

"I see, if there is nothing to be done, then we can’t go any further. I hope at some point you will at least allow us to study your walls and castle so we can try to replicate it." Bryce said. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Your majesty, about what you said earlier. Although I am a new leader I hope I am able to speak my mind. I still think that everyone is putting too much emphasis on what the Tenth leader’s achievements were that day.

"Weren’t all the leaders there to stop Cindy? Didn’t everyone fight? Without them, wouldn’t the Tenth have perished as well? I just think, with so many strong vampires the families had, including myself, the vampire settlement is giving the tenth too much glory."

The leaders who were there that day, knew how much Quinn had done, and not just him, his knights and his people. Which was why they didn’t say anything, but could understand why a new leader would feel this way.

Prima wanted to interject but Bryce stopped him once more, and he saw Quinn standing up from his seat instead.

’How will you deal with this young one?’ Bryce thought.

"If you want, you can test my strength out for yourself?" Quinn suggested. "I want to test out a few things myself as well. If I beat her convincingly I guess none of the new leaders will have any more doubts about me?"

———

It was a strange request Quinn had made, but the one who actually suggested him to do such a thing was Vincent. He knew how vampires reacted to certain things. The vote was set and this didn’t need to be done, but to make sure no one touched his family and for the new leaders to understand this would be the best cause of action. He would gain respect from the new and the old.

So currently, all the leaders had moved to a large training hall in the King’s castle. It was a huge room with wooden floorboards. Empty apart from the large windows on either side letting in the moonlight. On one side stood Quinn, on the other the new leader Kim, who held a rapier in her hand, the same weapon as Prima used.

"How do you think this exhibition match will go?" Muka asked, standing next to Jin.

"I think it’s obvious who the winner will be, but it will be interesting to see. I heard Prima has been raising quite the talent. Maybe one day Kim will have speed that even surpasses him. If anything, her ability might make Quinn have some trouble."

Watching over the match was the Royal Knight Prima himself. Being the fastest vampire, he should be able to stop anything if something was to happen. However, even though he didn’t say it to Kim, even he believed she would lose.

"The match will now begin!" Prima shouted.

Kim and Quinn were standing at opposite ends of the halls, so they found it a little strange when Kim started to stab the air from such a distance away with her thin rapier blade. The movements were fast and soon they were seeing little red dots of blood energy hovering in place.

After several attacks, she swiped her blade and all of them shot out like bullets towards Quinn. When they turned their head to see how Quinn would deal with the attack, they could see he was just walking ahead, one foot ahead of the other. When the attacks came towards him, he continued to walk.

"Look under his feet!" Jin noticed.

The shadow had spread, and it was spread far and wide, around ten meters in all directions away from Quinn. When the attack had entered the shadow’s zone, straight away it raised up, stopping the attacks.

Not only that, but once the attacks were stopped by the shadow, Quinn could now move the positions of the shadows and when dropping it redirecting the attacks. He did it in a way, so the attacks would just hit the side of the walls.

’This is a good test for my powers, I can do things I never even thought of!’ Quinn was excited. Before holding attacks would take up MC points as well, being able to hold and move an attack was great for Quinn.

’What is with this guy, we are both leaders shouldn’t our strength be similar, then why do I feel so...so..scared.’ She thought.

Everyone around could feel the pressure as well. There was something about how Quinn had acted, just walking forward acting with no worry, and not even trying. The scene in front of them would be common if it was a leader and a regular vampire, but they were looking at two vampire leaders.

Some were even wondering if Quinn had gotten stronger now after the fight with Cindy, and they weren’t wrong.

At first, Kim wanted to weaken Quinn before diving in, but with no choice she dived in with her weapon, moving faster than ever. She stepped into the shadow, but Quinn didn’t raise them, or do anything to try to slow her down.

She thrust her rapier towards his head, at a speed that would even match Prima’s.

"I got you!" She shouted, but the blade was grabbed by Quinn’s b.a.r.e hand at the very end. Then before she could even blink, the blade was snapped, and Quinn had grabbed her neck.

"I got you."

"The fight is over!" Prima quickly said.

The speed he had witnessed displayed by Quinn, was something he didn’t even see against Cindy. They were right, Quinn had gotten stronger after the fight with Cindy. What they didn’t realise was during the fight with Cindy, Quinn didn’t have his beast gear due to it being taken away from him.

With everything done and no leaders now set to question him, Quinn could finally prepare to go home.

"Is there anyone else that would like to challenge him?" Bryce asked but there were no objections.

As Quinn walked past Bryce and the other leaders he paused for a second and looked at them all.

"I am a fair person, you have accepted my request and I hope you treat the tenth family better from now on. Our relationship should be one that benefits each other. Bryce, I don’t know why you have supported me so much but because of that, I will tell you something.

"Something you should all hear. I don’t know why, or what you all did, but Arthur is coming for you, and he aims to get rid of you all. If you want to beat him, you have to get stronger, and you can’t rely on me for help."

Walking out of the training room, Quinn walked past a frozen Bryce.
