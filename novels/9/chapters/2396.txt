The sound of the bell made it clear that something was about to happen, and even more so now that they could see the lifeless Chronos in the room sprinting to life. They were standing and more energetic than before.

It looked like some type of switch had been flicked. Before, it felt like they were in an energy-saving mode. It was the perfect time for Russ to act. Since he had created an awkward situation, he decided to quickly make it unawkward by getting rid of the Hinto he had made.

"Hey, what are we going to do now, are we changing the plan?" Chris asked.

"I already got rid of the Hinto guy." Russ replied. "I think we need to focus on what's going on down here at the moment. It seems like we might need to focus. However, I would have liked to have known just how strong our opponents we are going to face are."Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

The reason why Russ wanted to know about his opponents so much was because of his MC cells weakening with each summon or use of his powers. If he had an idea of the strength of his opponent, he could summon something that was just strong enough to beat them.

This would allow him to summon and use more of his power as he went on. Summon something too strong, and use up all of his MC cells, then he was literally a sitting duck.

Sure, he had two more special weapons on him now, but his skills with a sword weren't the best, and summoning the one from the sword took a lot.

Holding onto the sword, Russ started to walk up to one of the Chronos that had their backs facing away from the others.

"What are you thinking of doing?" Hikel said, standing in his way.

"We weren't able to figure out how strong the champion is, but we should at least get an idea of how strong the general beasts and people of this world are. If you want to survive, then this is the best option and I'm telling you now, I didn't come to this place to die." Russ answered.

Russ went to walk forward again, but Hikel refused to move.

"That is not the vampire way. These people have not attacked us, there is no reason for us to do them any harm. Even if it's to increase our chances of survival, I would not be able to live that way."

"Are you stupid or something?" Russ replied. "Do I need to remind you, I am not a vampire."

After splitting up Peter and Russ, Chris thought that these problems would disappear and if the two were to fight, he wondered what he should do.

'I really wish Quinn was here, he would be able to sort these two out.'

In the middle of their small argument, they could hear the sound of footsteps coming from the staircase to their side. There was only one person on the other side, so it meant the champion Shinto was coming down.

Naturally, all three of them started to move from the staircase and headed to where all the other Chronos were. Since they looked different from all the others that were down here, they felt like getting caught would bring them trouble.

All fifty of those in the underground area with them were lined up, close to the red barrier from before. The group mixed themselves within the people. Suddenly, the red barrier disappeared.

Immediately, all of the Chronos ran from their position and into the other area. They were fast, faster than the average vampire. Based on how heavy their footsteps were, they seemed to be strong as well.

Vampires were fast in a different way through movement of their limbs, while the Chronos seemed to be a mixture of strength. They had exploding movement speed.

On the other side of the red barrier, the area was completely different from where they were. They could feel the wind and the strange energy in the air stronger here. When looking up, they could also see the sky.I think you should take a look at

Looking around them, there were incredibly tall high walls. No, they weren't walls, because they weren't built out of any structure and it felt like they were incredibly thick.

That's when they realized that they were in a giant hole. The area was incredibly large, twice as large as the underground part they were in before, and due to it being nothing but a hole, it was quite dark where they were.

This wasn't a problem for the three as they had traits that allowed them to see in the dark, but it appeared that the Chronos struggled a little more. They could see this as the Chrono's reached around the floor as if they were looking for something.

What was spread all across the floor were weapons. Weapons just stuck in the ground or lying there, all different types, all different shapes and sizes.

Chris went ahead and picked up one of the weapons, as he infused his Qi into it he activated the weapon.

"These are‚Ä¶ amazing," Chris said. "I'm not sure if they're beast weapons or not, as they don't quite feel the same, but the power I'm receiving back from them, is at the Demi-god tier level, it's pretty close to even being at the demon tier level."

Just in case, Chris picked up a few of the other weapons, and they were all the same, all of the weapons spread on the ground were of the same calibre.

"All of these weapons are close to the demon tier level, and the beings using these aren't weak either," Hikel said. "Not allowing them to escape, yet allowing them to use weapons like this. Whoever trapped all of these people, they must be confident despite all of this."

Russ had noticed something and using his powers, he took on the features of the Chrono, changing his body. He started to blend in, and spread himself out away from the other two.

They saw this but decided to ignore Russ, he was doing his own thing, as long as he didn't get in their way, then it would be fine. As for the two of them, they tried to hide their presence as much as possible, because from the entrance they could see Shinto standing there, looking at all of the participants.

He didn't have his weapons drawn and it was hard to read the face he currently had on, yet Chris felt like he once had a familiar feeling in him. It was as if he had the look of someone who didn't agree with what they were doing, but felt like they could do nothing about it.

A feeling that Chris knew very well.

The loud sound of the bell went off again, it rang clearer than before and was coming from above. When they looked up, they could see creatures crawling in from above, attached to the wall on the sides. A distinct smell had hit Chris's nose, all of the hair on his body was standing up.

Hikel's own body was shaking as well as he could see the creatures.

'How could they‚Ä¶ be in a place like this... this makes no sense, why are there Werewolves here!'
