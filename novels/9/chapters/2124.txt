Hearing that someone was looking for Quinn wasn't so strange. After all he was popular with everyone, friends, enemies, celestials and all sorts. However, with recent events there weren't many that would know his name.

On top of that, he was now on the Mermerial planet, a planet that he had only visited once. The only person that had been here before that he knew was Sil, and he was unsure if Sil was the one looking for him.

"Someone was looking for me?" Quinn asked confused. "Is it Yongbu?"ALL new ùíÑhapters ùíên nùíêv(ùíÜ)lbin(.)com

This was his first guess, but it still made no sense, how would the celestial know he would be here, unless they already knew about him.

"Yongbu, that is a name that I haven't heard in a while." Wince replied. "After he met with you, he only visited a couple of times, but even those that worship him have stated that they can't sense his presence these days, at least not close by, so there is a chance that he is busy with something else."

That was good news for Quinn, it was one less thing for him to worry about.

"Actually, I'm not sure who they were. I have never seen them before nor did they state a name. They were also here yesterday so it has caused quite a surprise." Wince explained. "We don't know how they got on the planet in the first place, but there is one thing that I am quite certain about, and that's the fact that they looked human."

"Humans all the way out here?" Layla repeated, just as stunned as everyone else.

What human would be on the Mermerial planet and looking for Quinn. There were some celestials that looked human, but if the celestials did find out about him escaping, he feared that most likely Mundus himself would come.

"Honestly, I can't say anything else on the matter, because as soon as they came, they left just as quickly. Saying that they would be back, when you arrived. The only thing was, I never expected you to arrive so soon after them."

For now, since there wasn't much else on the matter, Quinn would have to put a pin in it.

For now, Quinn was to be shown his new living area and shown what their life would be like on the Mermerial planet. They were assigned a couple of escorts, one a fish man and another a fish woman, called Skin and Tint.

This was to allow the two sisters to catch up with each other but Quinn did give a warning to Ceril, that she was to come back to him at least once a day, and if she felt anything strange or had any problems, to rush to his side.

This was because at the end of the day, Ceril was no longer like them, and it was because of Quinn in the first place. Although Wince did have celestial energy in her from Quinn, she did not have any traits of a vampire like her sister.

Doing all of this, was because Quinn was adamant on not creating the same problem on the Mermerial planet as what happened on Earth.

The escorts eventually took Quinn to a living area that was still within the palace grounds and they were treating him extremely nicely, and even while walking through the palace, there were many that would come over offering bracelets, gifts and more to him.

Some of them were quite the young females, and they would soon run off with red faces.

"I guess even other races still think he has a handsome face." Russ commented.

"Yes, and they need to remember that I am right here beside him." Layla gritted her teeth slightly and was squeezing onto Minny's hand a little tighter than usual.

The living area was located behind the main palace, where several councillors, politicians and heads of clans lived. The mermerial race was a strange mix of traditional values mixed with modern ideals, and what brought this all together was the Royal family.

The house they were staying in had a unique taste, looking like a giant clam on the outside but was decorated well with lots of space for them all to have a room each on the inside.

"We hope you enjoy your stay here, and if there is anything you need please ask us." Both the escorts said bowing their heads down. "Wince has asked that if you do leave the planet there is no need to get permission, but just to inform one of us beforehand."

After the two had left, the tension and awkwardness had disappeared.

"What did you do for them to treat you like this?" Russ asked. "Did you save the planet or something."

"Yeah, something like that." Quinn answered, while he sat down in a large blue chair that almost was like a throne so he could think about the next move.

Russ was left a bit speechless, because he had said it as a joke, but it seemed to actually be true. The life that Quinn lived compared to the rest of them was vastly different.

The question that was on Quinn's mind was where would he begin his search for the Blades. There was no clue where he should begin his search, but he wanted to move quickly.

Unlike last time, although he didn't mind his family living here enjoying a peaceful life, he needed to act and would go on a search.

'Maybe we can kill two birds with one stone.' Quinn thought, looking at Russ. 'We can search planets for information while also looking for nest crystals to increase Russ' strength.

'That would mean Russ coming with me. My family, they will be safe here, the Mermerials are strong, stronger than when there was infighting from before. It will take a long time if Jim ever did decide to come this far.

'It seems he doesn't know much about what I have done, so I doubt he could guess to come find me in a place like this. I'm more likely to run into them, and if that happens, I'll just have to shadow link to come back to Minny.'

Although he had said to himself there was no time to spare, he didn't want to rush off just yet. There was a little nag in the back of his mind as to who were the people that wished to meet with him.

They said they would come, so maybe he should stay a couple of days, and see what they wanted.

"I'm going to go for a walk, I'll be back soon." Quinn said, as he left the house and went to explore aimlessly.

He didn't know where he was going, nor did he want to bother the two escorts. It was just when his mind was full, it was easier for him to walk. A lot of his recent thoughts had been back to the fight that Sil had.

'I still can't believe it, Borden you're really gone‚Ä¶ and Nell as well.' Quinn thought. 'I didn't even get to say goodbye, or any final words. This has happened so many times already. It feels like everyone is leaving me, and one day everyone will leave me while I'm still alive, still fighting.'

Where was the end in sight for Quinn? This was playing heavily on his mind. He enjoyed living with his family, but as they grew older, would they eventually get involved in conflicts that he would have to deal with?

And what would happen, how would he feel if he lived to see one of them lose their life? The cycle of pain for Quinn was repeating and as time went on it was just getting bigger and bigger.

Eventually Quinn could see a beautiful sight in front of him. There was a watery lake inside the castle grounds. It was large, and gigantic. There was a pathway that was built out and a small little platform where one could sit out and enjoy the view of the lake.

Seeing this, Quinn started to walk out on the pathway and onto the platfrom. He looked out at the beautiful sight with the sun sparkling off the lake.

"After thinking about all that, I get to see something so beautiful that I never would have seen if I was gone." Quinn smiled to himself.

"Sorry to interrupt." A voice said from behind. "But we have been waiting for you."

Turning around, Quinn saw the two people, and he could recognise them both immediately, but it didn't put a smile on his face at all.

"Bliss‚Ä¶ Sam, I'm guessing you two still remember me?"
