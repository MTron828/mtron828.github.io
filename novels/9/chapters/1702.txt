Chapter 1703: Millennial history. (Part 1)

Seeing Logan in front of him, Quinn felt a sense of relief that he was reunited with one of the people who had been with him through his tough times.

After all, he was among one of the first friends he had made in the academy and had stuck with him until this point and time.

He wanted to talk to Logan, in the straightforward way he used to, perhaps in a more comfortable environment.

Still, Quinn also knew that there was a lot to be done before that, and maybe Logan had a better way of showing them everything rather than being questioned one by one.

"I will assume that since all of these people are with you and know you as Quinn, it is safe to tell them everything," Logan stated.

"If that is the case, I will begin my presentation for you."

"Ever since you disappeared, Quinn. I have been working on this project and updating it with all the information that you might need once you wake up."

"But, of course, I never expected things to last this long, and I ended up storing a lot of data."

"To be honest, there is never a moment when I don't feel as if it was my fault that you did not awaken ten years after your slumber as I had predicted."

The girls looked at each other. They had no clue that Logan was a close acquaintance of the Hero Quinn.

They did know that Logan is said to have witnessed and survived back then, when the war had started, and there were rumours that the Green family had supported the great hero, but it was clear that there was much more to it than that.

"I'm ready. Show me everything you got." Quinn nodded.

Logan, in response, pressed a button, and all of the panels of the walls started to light up slightly green.

The next second, they began to show images, and finally, everyone once again felt like they had been transported to another place as if they got teleported.

The place they currently were, was back in the tomb of the tenth castle. Here was where the group agreed to send Quinn off into his eternal slumber.

Again, everything could be heard, including the dialogue of the others, everyone bidding goodbye.

"I created the unique chest piece that would be able to monitor your readings. It notified me how much energy was being consumed from the nest crystal."

"Based on the readings that I had gathered from that day, I concluded that the energy drained from the crystal would take about ten years to complete."

"However, I was very wrong in that prediction. Although you started off consuming a lot of energy from the crystal initially, the rate of consumption slowly began to decrease over time."

The scene changed once more, showing everything as Logan spoke, helping them visualise more. It had gone to the vampire settlement and the state they and the current people were in.

"With the nest crystal being used to keep your body in a stable state, it meant that the vampires no longer had a steady blood supply the same as before."

"Although we knew there were plenty of nest crystals out there in the universe, it didn't solve the current problem."

"At the same time, Earth still wasn't exactly a safe place. The Vampire Soldiers, some of the military forces along with Shiro and Leo, were still suppressing Pure."

"They were doing a good job and were getting rid of bases Pure, one by one."

"This was when a certain individual had stepped up. Perhaps it is a bit unfair to say one individual, as two had stepped up. Fex and Samantha."

"Thanks to these two, the vampires and humans were able to work so well together. The vampires trusted Fex, as they all knew he had a close relationship with you, while the humans trusted Samantha due to her relation to them."

"It was the perfect combination; They had set up systems for vampires and humans, such as blood donation and more."

"Eventually, we also discovered a nest crystal, allowing the vampires to regain their blood supply."

A lot of this Quinn had learnt from Andy, but when did it all start going so wrong?

From what Quinn could see in the videos, the vampires, humans, and everyone was experiencing a happy life. In the video, there were even some scenes with the Dalki.

Quinn remembered that a group of Dalki had agreed to surrender on a certain planet and provided them with information during the war in exchange for mercy.

It was most likely that they were all dead by now singe they had a low life span in the first place.

"The situation back on Earth gradually improved. However, Sera and leo could not locate Zero, Chris or the other core members."

"But they had managed to seize almost all of their operations, taking back everything under their control, and then they handed it to me."

"Finally, for the first time in a long time. Humans were able to go back to Earth, and on top of that, they invited the vampires to live amongst them as well."

"Since many still had a good impression of you, Quinn, there was next to no one against vampires being part of human society."

"Many of the old vampires that somewhat opposed this idea were already in slumber. And the new generation had the choice to decide what they needed to do."

"At the same time, those who didn't wish to go to Earth had the choice to remain in the vampire settlement or settle on the Graylash planets."

Unlike what Quinn had thought, Leo was still alive at this point. They were successful in their tasks. So the question still remained what had changed and what had happened to the Cursed faction.

"Although humans said that they were fine with living among vampires, it was a difficult task."

"Samantha creating what is known as the Vampire Corps today. They managed to keep the vampires and humans in check."

"That was until something strange began to occur."

"More and more humans were being turned into vampires, and they were turned forcefully."

"Pinpointing how and why this was happening was hard, and we failed to deal with the problem. The humans were starting to lose trust, but they decided to listen."

"This was mainly because the Cursed faction, the faction you had created, strongly supported the vampires at the time."

"Most of us were growing old, Quinn, but we were determined to fix things, make things right, and achieve what you wanted."

"In truth, I had even thought about waking you up because of the problem. I was trying to find some way for your body to absorb the crystal."

"After all, it had already been a lot more than just ten years at that point."

"However, when we went to your tomb, you had disappeared, and only you had disappeared because the rest of the vampire settlement was still there, along with everything else."

"We searched for you and Peter a lot and did our best to find both of you, and perhaps because we put too much focus on that, we completely missed what was happening on Earth."

"Something strange was happening slowly; something was changing. In fact, I should say it was the turning point that led to the world's current state."√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

"I was busy with duties on Earth, creating systems, and helping out Fex on a day to day basis. Meanwhile, Sam continued to focus on the Cursed faction, all of them were looking for you."

"The first sign that something was wrong and the situation was out of control was when Sam suddenly disappeared."

"Till this day, no one knows what happened to him, but without him, the Cursed faction fell apart and began to lose hope and sight of what they were doing in the first place."

"Then, finally, it had started. There was an attack on Earth from someone we had completely forgotten about, the true first vampire king, Laxmus."
