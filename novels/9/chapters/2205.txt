When the first wave of Dalki came crashing down on the planets, the battle was intense. The Dalki were confident in their fighting power, and having survived a number of battles, they showed next to no fear going into this one.

After all, the Dalki's were resilient, they were hard to kill, and only got stronger the more injured they were. It was almost like a drug to them, the power they would feel when they got injured and after every battle, they felt as if their own bodies were evolving, as if their spikes on their back was growing.

This did seem to be the case, but the Dalki were unaware of just how hard this battle would be, against a group of organised aliens all with their own unique powers. With the humans' support, the battle continued to be intense, but eventually after a few hours of fighting things started to cool off.

The humans and the Dalki, grouped up together rather than fighting separately, in doing so they were occupying certain areas and districts of different areas. They had healers in their group that would heal the injured and they would only go out to try and attack on the order of a commander.

The fighting had settled into only certain areas, with territories on both sides.

"The Dalki and humans have managed to cover around a 5 km radius of the centre of the city. They have humans with sensor abilities making it hard for us to approach without alerting them." One of the Mermerials reported to Wince.

"Get the Penswi to surround them in all directions but not get too close to alarm them. We will let them be the ones to make the move, they are the ones that are attacking and we should keep it that way. With their speed they should be able to alert us soon as possible and not get hurt." Wince ordered.

The current situation, waiting and being patient, only attacking certain areas and the stray Dalki and humans was more ideal for their group who had the larger force, at least still had the larger force, for now.

'They're being more patient than they were in their last attacks, maybe that just goes to show how much of a tough situation we have managed to put them in.' Wince thought. 'For now this works out for us. The longer this war drags on, the more chance we have of Quinn coming out of that tower and sorting out everything.'

Stark for now was helping out the Penswi, while they were all waiting for something, each of the main rescue group of Sil were doing their own thing to help their people. Since the Penswi were ordered to try and find the range of the group, Stark was the one that volunteered.

He had a device in his hand, a radar that showed where he was on the Amra planet.

'I'm the fastest, so I won't get hurt.' Stark thought. 'If I can find out just where their powers work and don't work then the Penswi can safely monitor the group.'

He walked forward bit by bit, going through the alleyways and destroyed buildings, stopping a few times waiting. Walking a bit more, he stayed still again.

He was in a mostly broken building and was standing behind a wall trying to creep by the side.

"I can sense him!" One of the humans said. "2 o'clock, hiding behind that wall."

As soon as Stark heard footsteps, there was a Dalki fist breaking right through the wall. The Dalki smashed it and looked around, expecting to see a dead alien on the ground but instead there was nothing.

"I'm over here, your slow fists will never be able to hit me." Stark taunted and winked at the Dalki. Out of extreme anger the Dalki lept from its position to where Stark was, and he was immediately running.

As he ran, they were chasing him down, it wasn't just a Dalki, but it looked like there was a human with super speed that was on his tail as well.

'This armour is amazing, I'm not even using the special power that Quinn said it had, yet I feel faster, and stronger by just wearing it. If I was to run now, these guys would never be able to catch up with me‚Ä¶ this makes me excited to use the skill in the armour but I have to savour it.'

Stark took a turn down an alleyway, there were two buildings that were still standing and the area was dark. In front of him there was another Dalki blocking his way.

"Brother, stop him!" the Dalki shouted.

Stark continued to run and as he did, he slid across the ground, and stood right behind the Dalki, with a smile on his face. The human and Dalki, were a bit confused why the other Dalki didn't do anything.

They continued to run forward, and as they got closer they realised something, but it was too late. The Dalki that was in the alleyway reached out and grabbed the Dalki right by its head.

"I am not one of your brothers!"Aall ùíèùíÜwest chùíÇptùíÜrs on n.o./vùíÜlùíÉi/n/(.)cùíêm

The Dalki that was in the alleyway had a strange human-like face. Something they had seen before but there was something off about this one. That was because the Dalki in question was Russ.

Making a fist, Russ punched it in its stomach holding onto its head and made a hole right through its chest. The human was stunned ready to move, but before it could get away, Russ threw the Dalki's body right at the human hitting it in the back.

Russ quickly ran to where the human was and kicked the heavy Dalki body off it, then soon after lifted his foot stomping the human right on the head.

"I thought you might have had a bit of hesitancy when it came to killing your own kind, but now I see I had nothing to worry about." Stark said.

"These people would try to kill me even if I was human anyway, and it's not my first time." Russ answered as his body was reverting back to normal. "People seem to forget since I'm hanging out with that goodie goodie Quinn, but I am not a good person."

Stark could certainly see that Russ's words were true by being around him. Regardless, he thought the two of them made quite the good team.

"Jack do you think you have everything under control? '' Jim asked through the intercom. "Or do you think you need a bit of support? As you know, it's most likely that their capital will be even harder to take, so we can do this one together."

When Jim was asking this question, the tone of his voice, one could tell he wasn't sincere. It was almost as if Jim was happy that Jack was struggling with all of this.

"Please, it has only been a few hours since this whole operation has started." Jack answered. "Why would I send a whole army to crush a single ant. You just go do what you need to do, and then we will come and clean up what you can't clean up."

Jim didn't need to be asked twice, as the second large Marpo Crusie started to move away, and was heading for the Amra capital, the planet where Quinn and the tower resided.

‚Äî‚Äî

Up in the air, everyone could see it, they could see that the large Marpo Cruise was moving away.

'Not yet.' Layla thought in her head. 'We need to wait until they have engaged with Geo and the others. Once we get the word, then it's time for us to move onto the second part of our plan.'

With the current stalemate continuing between the two, around three hours later, they had finally gotten the word. That the other Marpo Cruise was now attacking.

After that, Layla quickly arrived at one of the camps that had been made by the Dalki and humans, she stood on top of one of the buildings, and lifting her hand, rubble from all over the ground was lifted in the air.

"Everyone, you have permission to use your powers, and it's time to clear all of the Dalki off this planet!" Layla ordered, and the message was heard loud and clear by the others.
