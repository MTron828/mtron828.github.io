Chapter 519: A new family's task

The king had finished giving his report on the situation and had finally sat down. From Quinn's memories, he now knew this meant that the room was open for questions, and one would have to raise their hand and the king would then point at them to allow them to speak.

When the king was there, the leaders were a lot more rational, rather than shouting out of turn. The first to raise their hand was the first leader, Bryce.

"Forgive me for saying this so soon," Bryce said. "But don't we all know who brought these humans in. After all, there is one of us here who has already brought humans with him, did he not? Perhaps they had followed him in, or maybe they came looking for said humans that he had brought with him."

A few of the other leaders seemed to agree with this statement. The time was clearly short between events, not once had they ever been invaded by humans, and now they had two incidents like this. Maybe it was Quinn's plan all along. He knew he wouldn't be strong enough to save them, so he reported the place to the military.

However, upon hearing what Bryce had said, Clark who was in the room as Jim's vampire knight thought of something. Quinn had gotten the teleporter from his base. It was a portable teleporter, so there was only one location that could be used as transport, and the portable teleporters didn't require a code to be inputted in.

Quinn was young and didn't know how the vampire teleporters worked. It could have been that he hadn't taken one of the timer grenades. These were set to be used with the portable teleporters, allowing for them to be destroyed once one would step through it.

He thought long and hard, but in the end, this was only a theory, for the humans to even find such a teleporter they would have had to have arrived on the training planet, and the humans hadn't stepped foot on that planet in years, so why would they choose to suddenly return now.

While this was only a theory and a shot in the dark, Clark would remain silent about the matter.

"Bryce, I did not call this meeting for accusations. We may look into that at a later time. Right now I'm asking for solutions." The king replied.

"Has any actions been taken so far?" Cindy, the second leader asked.

"Actually, we knew of the humans' actions before even this." One of the royal knights said. "Our intel from the earth tells us that they had already made a movement and were researching the training planet. I'm afraid we were too distracted with current events at the time." The knight said, looking at Quinn.

"However, even though we had acted a little slow, we were able to jam their teleporters. It seems like they are still using the old type. So we sent them to the locker."

This was something that hadn't come up when Quinn was stuck in Vincent's memory. He had spent some time in the vampire world as Vincent, but not long enough for a mention of something like this. At the same time, it wasn't as if Vincent and Quinn's memory had joined together, so Quinn had no clue what this locker place was.

"We have also sent the Wendigos through the tunnels to their location. They have now arrived on our planet." The other royal knight by the king's side replied. "It should delay them for now, but from what we can see through the familiars, it seems like the soldiers are quite skilled and organized. When they realize their weakness it shouldn't take them long to deal with them." UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

"I think we need to ask a few more questions." Jill said standing up. "First, we need to know, do you want them dead, or captured alive?" She asked.

The king hesitated for a while before giving his answer. Whenever he needed to make a decision he needed to do so that would please both sides. "It would be best if we can keep them alive, but I don't want any vampires to die in the process of trying to do so. It seems like this will be a hard battle so my only request would be, to try and bring in the leader back alive."

"That settles it then, for only two hundred or so men, there is no need for all of us to go. I think only one family is needed to fight alongside the wendigo's to deal with this." Jill replied.

"If that's the case then I have a suggestion to make," Prima said. "I think this would be a good chance for the new sixth leader to prove himself. Show he is capable of the position we have given him. Allow him to lead the sixth army and take care of them."

Many of the vampires seemed to be in agreement with this suggestion. For them, there didn't actually seem to be much panic. It looked as if they were more annoyed or bothered by this nuisance more than anything.

"Wait!" Bryce interrupted, as he could see it looked like the king was about to agree with the solution. "Are we forgetting that there is another new leader among us? I think the tenth leader is also a good candidate to go and deal with the humans. It will also prove to us all here that he is indeed not working with them."

"What are you thinking!" Edward shouted in anger. "You know the tenth family still are unaware of who their leader is. It would be almost impossible for Quinn to gather up an army right now. No, even before there aren't many that are loyal enough to the tenth to go into such a battle."

'"Is that my fault, this is a leader's responsibility is it not?" Bryce said.

Gritting his teeth in anger, it looked as if Edward was about to climb over the table and attempt to punch the smug smile off Bryce's face and he might have done, if it wasn't for the fact that Quinn stood up, making it his turn to speak.

"I'll do it," Quinn said. "I'll go and take care of the humans for you."

The council room was a bit stunned by what they heard, not only did many of them expect Quinn to come up with a type of excuse but what amazed them, even more, was he didn't stutter, he didn't hesitate when saying these words.

Some of them doubted Quinn would ever be able to have the qualities of a leader, being strong wasn't enough. Right now, it seemed like he was a leader to them.

"Looks like I was right about you boy!" Arthur said from across the room. 'Don't worry we don't need a big army. I'll come with you. Remember how I said I would train you right? What better way than on the battlefield."

The king at first wasn't going to accept, after all the tenth vampires were also a part of his big family. He didn't want them to die either, but hearing that Arthur was going to join Quinn made him feel a lot more confident.

"Very well, Quinn the tenth leader will be given the task of defending the settlement against the intruders. The Sixth family will be on standby in case any troubles will occur, while the rest of us will try and gather more information and plan from there." The king ordered.

"Go, gather your people, and head out."

Quinn's friends were all waiting outside of the castle nervously wondering what was going on. They hadn't entered because they wanted to catch him as soon as he came back. Left in the dark they didn't know what was about to happen.

Then finally, walking down the path towards the castle they could see Quinn. At first, they were happy to see him, but then could see the serious look on his face. Something must have happened.

During this whole walk, Quinn was unsure of who to ask to come with him, he couldn't ask the tenth's people. He wasn't like that, he hardly knew them. He was sure Edward could rally up some people but that just didn't feel right with him.

However, while walking towards the castle and seeing his friends he thought of something else as well, another problem. They were about to go off and fight with humans. He could ask them, but nearly every one of Quinn's companions had been a human or was currently one at the moment.

He stood there in front of them all, for a while and then the words came out of his mouth.

"Guys...I need your help," Quinn said.

Out in the forest, the army was busy away dealing with the wendigos. They had finally figured out that to kill one, their head had to be crushed. Once they had learned this, they were falling one by one, but their strength still proved difficult and some of their men had died.

Due to Paul's orders though, he would shift people around at the right timer reinforcing the weak areas and improving on the people he had. Little by little, it seemed like the wendigo's had lessened.

"Sir, Northside!" his men shouted.

Looking to his north, he could see a new group of people coming out from the forest. All of them were wearing strange masks that would cover their face, and standing in the middle of them was one wearing an oni mask with two large tusks.
