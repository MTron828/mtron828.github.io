The demon general Lexor was looking at the scene of the base and wondering how he would explain this to the demon king. He wondered what the consequences would be for him allowing such a thing to happen. 

The worst thing was, that there was no head to gift to the demon king either, to show who was responsible for all of this. The one saving grace was that they had managed to actually defeat the person responsible. 

"Make sure to put the dead off to the side, and not in the pile like the rest!" Lexor shouted. 

He wanted to see which ones had been killed off in all this mess, and how. From checking out the system, quite a few of the high ranked ones seemed to have been defeated, as in those that would do well in the hunting games.

While the low ranking ones had survived, and he wanted to know why that was. After inspecting some of the bodies for a short while, the answer became quite clear. 

The more talented demons thought that they could face the rain of blood swords that had come down. They believed that it wouldn't kill them, while the others were afraid.

This was the difference between the two, if some of the Durum demons hadn't turned their back or shelled up, as they could do, then the blood swords would have wiped out the entire camp. 

Walking away from the dead bodies, Lexor was going back to his group to see how they were doing, it had been a stressful day. His hand raised up to his head, and it paused for a second. 

He squinted his eyes trying to focus on something in the distance, his feet stopped and as he figured out who the figure was in front of him. His mouth started to open, his eyes turned to the other demons around him, but they all seemed busy with the task. 

"He… he's… he's here." Lexor said, his bottom lip quivering. "He's still alive." 

Walking into the base, was the same person that had just attacked them, but he had walked in casually. He didn't have a single mark on him either. 

"I was sure I stabbed him right in the chest, there was nowhere for him to be seen, why would he appear now of all times?" Lexor thought. 

Not only that, but for some reason, there were three Skullys with him as well. Although they looked frightened out of their wits. They were shaking with every step and hunched in together. 

They were, after all, in enemy territory.

"Why… why… why… why are we here?" Ekeke asked. 

He had never seen so many demons in one area before. They knew where Quinn was going, he stated several times that he was serious about going after Immortui and this certainly was the quickest way, but it was also the quickest way to their death as well. 

"I know we're scared." Anon said. "But you have to know that the hunting game, it doesn't end until we are all dead anyway. If we are going to die, then it should be on our terms and while putting up a fight." 

Anon wanted to try to help Quinn to kill as many demons as possible, even if he was unable to take on Immortui. 

However, of the three, Tuni had noticed the strange tension in the demon base, something overlooked by the other two due to their fear. All the dead bodies that were around them.

"Was there some sort of attack?"

Tuni's guess was right, and he wasn't the only one that had noticed something strange happening. Many of the Skullys inside the forest that had been saved had met up with others. 

They started to talk about the mysterious figure that was able to kill the demons while they also realised that the demons hadn't attacked them in a while. The commotion and noise that was being caused, as well as the smell of blood in the air, they had decided to follow it. 

In doing so, it had led them to the base. Unlike Anon and the others, they had opted to watch from afar though, staying in the treetops, and looking at what was about to happen.

"Why is everyone just standing around, the enemy is right in front of you, he isn't dead, get him!" Lexor shouted. 

He himself placed both hands out in front of him, and the red crystal shards started to fire out. The others that had heard the order started to act, doing the same, firing all of them towards them. 

With as many shards as there were coming towards them, the Skullys felt like they were doomed, they had hardly survived against an attack from three, let alone over fifty of them. 

Before the shards had even hit them, Quinn reached his hands out and small portals of shadow could be seen from his hand. Soon shadow portals were opening up all over the place. 

Before the shards hit them, the shadow raised, like a tube surrounding all of them, and as the shards went into the shadow, they went out, going right through the shadows that were placed elsewhere. 

The sound of several sharp rocks crashing against each other were heard, while the others started to scream in pain. The red crystals were hard, harder than the normal skin on the Durum demon's body.

It was an unexpected move, they had seen the shadow before, they had seen what it could do, yet this time it had acted completely differently. In that one move, half of the demons had been killed, making their numbers even smaller than before.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

While many were injured. When the shadow went down, Anon and the others were left confused, they had no idea what happened, and wondered why suddenly so many of the demons had been killed. 

"You… you're the boss of this place right?" Quinn asked, as he continued to walk forward. 

One of the demons that was close, crystallised their hand and started to run towards them.  A piece of blood from another one of the demons that were on the ground rose up, and travelled through the air like a bullet, killing it on the spot. 

The blood started to rise up from the dead all around, and in doing so, slashed those that were injured and those that were running towards him.

The Skullys that were watching in the forest were mesmerised by every move. The champions used mostly brute strength and fought with their fists, legs and arms. 

This was something completely different, it was the sense that this figure was untouchable. 

Lexor looked around as he saw Quinn pointing towards him, and before he could answer he felt a sharp pain in his left knee, he fell to the ground only being able to use one leg. 

'What is this… how could I, a demon general, be dealt with so easily. How could someone have so much power in this world that I don't even know about, that I've never met before!' Lexor thought. 

He hadn't even seen what had hit his leg, but he could tell immediately that he had lost this fight. He didn't know why, but after having supposedly killed this person, he seemed to come back stronger.

There was now not a single one of them left alive other than the demon general. 

The Skullys were no longer afraid, their legs had stopped shaking and they had stopped huddling together.

"What do you want… why are you attacking us?" Lexor was starting to think a little more clearly now. There were a number of questions that needed to be asked. The person in front of him didn't look like any of the inhabitants. 

At the same time, he didn't have any type of appearance he recognized among the other demons.

"He's looking for the demon king and the champion!" Anon said. "Tell him where it is, if you want to live." 

A certain little Skully had gained some confidence based off of another one's strength. 

"No." Quinn answered. "I know where the demon king and champion is… I need to go."
