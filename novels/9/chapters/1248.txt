Chapter 1249 - Double Dalki

When Eno stood up and spoke, the rest of them were hanging on to his every word. There was something about the way he spoke, making them feel that it was of great importance, so they took everything he said seriously.

After explaining to the others that Earth needed to be protected, there was a bit of catching up to do for the rest of humanity. It was time that the World Leaders, the ones involved, and the ones that were risking their lives to fight the threat actually knew what they were fighting against and why.

Everyone in the room knew what Eno was since the announcement of V. Quinn was the one who had outed him in the first place, claiming that he was the reason the Cursed faction leader had been turned into a V. However, most of this had been said to Oscar, and they weren’t sure how much of it had been passed down.

Eno decided to start from the beginning, admitting to being a vampire for those that didn’t know in the room. Also revealing how the vampires had tried to create a blood substitute so they would no longer have to rely on humans, which was what led to the creation of the Dalki.

As someone in the know, Quinn could tell that just like himself, Eno made sure to withhold the fact that there were still plenty of vampires out there, inhabiting an entire planet even. The old man made sure to only share the information that was needed for his current story.

"As a failed experiment the Dalki are incomplete beings, their lifespan being short and finite. It is their goal to do everything they can to survive, and for that they require a Demon tier beast that is currently on Blade Island. They will come for it soon." Eno finished his explanation there.

Only a select few had known about the real goal of the Dalki, most had believed them to merely be a genocidal race who had out for humans. It was a lot to take in for the uninformed, but because it had come from the Great Richard Eno himself, nobody questioned the validity.

"This whole situation is so crazy." Samantha couldn’t help but blurt out.

"I have a few questions to ask if I may." Owen interjected. "First of all, why don’t we kill the Demon tier beast? That way the Dalki should have no more reason to attack Earth, right?"

"You make it sound easy." Mona laughed seriously at this suggestion. "We have already visited the island with a group of us and even Quinn admitted that it wasn’t anything we could just defeat. What’s more, that thing is... strange."

A realisation hit the others, if the Demon tier beast was too strong for them to handle, and the Dalki had decided to attack now, it must have meant they had a way to either control the Demon tier beast or were sure that they could beat it to take it back.

"Do we know how they are planning to attack?" Sach asked. "At the moment, the teleportation station is being heavily guarded. Although the Dalki have cornered us, they still aren’t close enough to reach the teleportation system to head to Earth’s solar system."

"That’s because it won’t be the Dalki that are attacking. I predict that they will have their hands full dealing with the humans, just like they have done now and that the vampire I spoke of earlier, will be the one to lead the attack."

"The V that is working with Dalki, he is a great mind like myself. Getting to Earth will pose no problem for him. I’m sure you are already aware that one Dalki has managed to appear on the planet, without any prior warning signs. You can be sure that more will follow."

It was an issue that nobody in their group currently had a way of solving. Even if the Dalki were after Earth, it didn’t change the fact that most of their forces were currently engaged with the Dalki on the beast planets.

At the moment, there was only a small group protecting Earth, and the wealthiest of civilians.

’Quinn, I’m afraid that the others don’t really understand the real threat in allowing the Dalki to obtain the Demon tier beast.’ Vincent voiced his opinion, while everyone was deep in thought, discussing measures and certain tactics. At the moment, they were estimating how long their forces could last, with the amount of beast crystal they had.

’Do you remember the state that Leo described the Demon tier beast was in? He said that it appeared to be in a deep slumber. From the information I have gathered and what I have observed I believe that this was the case because half of the Demon tier beast has already had all its energy drained.’

’The Dalki were created with one half of the Demon tier beast and Logan said that there wasn’t enough energy to create anymore Dalki after Borden, but the beast is still somewhat alive. If it wasn’t it would have joined back up with the beast on Earth.’

’If the Dalki get their hands on the second half of the Demon tier beast there will be two major issues. One, they could use the Demon tier that still has plenty of energy left to create more incomplete Dalki.’

’Two, their goal would change. Rather than capturing the other half of the Demon tier beast, they could simply slay the one on the vampire’s side, gaining control over the complete version of it.’

When hearing Vincent explain it, the terror of them getting the Demon tier beast set in. So far the humans were only able to put up a decent fight due to their numbers, but if their forces could double, there would be no hope for them.

"I agree." Quinn said, interrupting the others that were speaking. "We have to prevent the Dalki from obtaining the Demon tier beast at all costs. I’m aware that everyone is busy defending the invaded planets and that they are worried that if they leave them, there will be no hope for them to survive, but if we allow them to get their hands on that Demon tier beast they will be able to double their numbers, if not worse!"

There was something else Quinn realised that he decided to keep to himself as well. Arthur had made a deal with the Dalki, so what were they getting from him? If what Vincent theorised was true, Arthur might have been tasked with killing the Demon tier beast that was in the Vampire World.

"I see that you are all troubled so I have a suggestion." Sam spoke up. "The main issue we have at the moment is travel. The Dalki possess the technology to block our own teleporters. Were it not for that, we could assign people to protect Blade Island, and you could head back to your respective planets in case they would need the reinforcements."

"Thanks to Quinn and Logan, we were able to create a device that can be used to disrupt their jamming device. At the moment, the Dalki don’t know about it. This could be our trump card against them! When Eno calls for help from us all, we can travel and protect Blade Island!"

The others were amazed by how much the Cursed faction had been able to help in this fight. If it wasn’t for Quinn and his friends humanity would have long since perished. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

"I can agree to that." Owen nodded. "As long as the Greylash planets and its people can be protected at any time, I will gladly go where I’m most needed. Providing the teleporters work of course."

Soon after, the rest of them agreed to this fact and a plan was put in place. For now, Eno, along with Mona, would head back to Blade Island and set up the teleporters. They would also stay there as a first line of defence.

Eno actually wanted Quinn to send some of his people back as well, but the Vampire Lord himself had refused, on the grounds that there were things he needed to do with them first. Seeing the look in his eyes, Eno understood that Quinn wouldn’t budge. Given the situation, it was apparent that Quinn must have intended to boost their strength as much as he could.

Up until now, they had done well and they had yet to let him down, so Eno didn’t insist on their arrival. The teleporters working was a big win for them. Additionally, Quinn did agree to send someone with the shadow ability over, so he could go there regardless if the teleporters were working or not.

"The next matter to be discussed is those that are known as the Chained." Sam stated standing up. "Hilston Blade has enslaved many strong people to have access to their abilities. A good portion of them have remained on Planet Caladi."

"Some of these are the strongest ability users in their field, including past leaders. They will be returned to their rightful factions."

Hearing this, there was a smile on Owen’s face. During the broadcast he had seen the face of his grandfather Grim Graylash still alive. Reclaiming those people who had been believed to have died, was a big win for the Graylash family as well as the Earthborn group as a whole.

"Before we go on to discuss each group’s plans and tactics for the fight against the Dalki, Nathan has one more matter he wishes to address." Sam sat back down in his seat to allow him to take over.

Nathan then stood up, with Ruby still sitting by his side.

"Supreme Commander Sach had given me an important mission while the attack was going on. With One Horn’s location having been confirmed on a different planet we knew it was the right opportunity to strike, and in doing so we rescued the humans."

While Nathan was speaking, Samantha suddenly sparked up, because she knew exactly what planet they were talking about.

"It turns out that the humans there had not been V at all, nor had they been working with the Dalki. The Dalki had kept them alive, glorified prisoners, probably to be used against us in some way." When Nathan said this, he was careful because he realised that neither Richard, nor Quinn had mentioned this Arthur person.

Since the latter seemed to be a V as well, he took that as a sign that it could be a secret they didn’t wish to share. As such, he chose to do the same.

"We have successfully freed them, and in doing so we have managed to retrieve this!"

Ruby, then placed the Demon tier weapon on the table for them all to see.

"Although it was our Cursed faction who discovered and secured the weapon, it originally belonged to the Earthborn group. Without Supreme Commander Oscar, we will have to choose the most suitable person to wield the sword for all of humanity’s sake!"

Everyone’s eyes were now glued onto the weapon. A Demon tier Weapon would be a boost to them all, and every single group wanted it for themselves.
