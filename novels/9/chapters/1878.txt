Chapter Ôªø1879 MY MAN!!!

Inside the castle-like structure, Layla was staring out the window looking at all of the vampires down below. The people had smiles on their faces and the streets were lit up. There was a good atmosphere all around.

The Red Vampire base had been rebuilt back to what it once was. There was the option of moving again, but Layla felt like there was now a history to the place for the people here. This gave the whole area more value. To them it felt more like a home and they had gone through the rebuilding of their home.

'I made the right decision in staying here.' Layla thought.

"You have done extremely well." Xander stated in the corner of the room with a bow. During the entire time, he had stayed by her side helping her fix and rebuild everything.

On top of that, he was happy because he had never seen Layla happier in these 1000 years. It was almost as if becoming the leader of the Red Vampires had given her a purpose that she was missing.

'Finally, she can forget about Quinn and continue to live her life. I'm sorry to say this. I know Quinn, you did a lot for her, and I know from the stories that Layla has said about the two of you that you cared for her, but with you gone again, it could be another 1000 years until you see each other again.

'I don't want her to hold on for that long, not again.'

Lifting his head, to look at Layla, he suddenly saw that a portal had appeared behind her. Immediately, Xander wasted no time rushing across the room, blood aura surrounded his fist as he went out to throw a punch.

It slammed into something solid and the strength behind the punch shook the room. However, whatever, or whoever had come out of the portal, was currently holding onto his fist.

"You shouldn't attack guests like this." Sil replied.

"Guests? You're an intruder!" When Xander said these words, he was trying to figure out who was in front of him. Judging from the smell, it seemed like a human but how would any human be able to hold his fist solidly like this.

Layla turned around and could only see the back of his head. Unlike Xander, she didn't react straight away but had her hand on her black sword that she kept at her side at all times.

"Everyone, it would be best if you were to calm down," the mysterious man stated. "I am just here because I want to take you to Quinn."

Those words had frozen both of them and before they knew it, Sil had grabbed Layla by the hand who was frozen and opened up another portal, taking her away.

Meanwhile, Xander was left stunned in place, Layla and the mysterious man no longer could be seen in front of him.

"Did he say‚Ä¶ Quinn? Is Quinn back‚Ä¶ I hope this outcome will be a good one for her." Xander stated as he smiled and decided to wait in the room for her return.

The portal opened up back in the lab where Logan and the others were, and stumbling through at first was Layla, and following her was none other than Sil.

"Alright, so it looks like everyone is here. It looks like we can talk now about what to do." Sil smiled.

At first Layla's eyes had landed on Logan, he was still as small as she remembered him, but it had been a long time since the two of them had last met. Her heart ached a little, thinking of all the time she had spent on the other side of the whole thing.

After that, she moved her head, with her eyes falling on the rest of the group. She had seen all of them during the attack before. Then finally, they laid on one person‚Ä¶ Quinn.

Immediately, she knew that this was him, his long black hair, his perfectly symmetrical face and his pointed, but strong, chin. There was no emotion on her face. The others were looking closely to see what her face would show but it looked calm and collected.

However, there was something on her body that was reacting and it was her horns. Constantly they were turning a bright red and cooling down. It was like a heartbeat only it was going incredibly fast as the horns continued to blink and blink.

Other than this, the two of them just stayed there staring at each other for a while. Not a single one of them saying a word.

"That's the one Daddy likes!" Minny shouted and pointed. She had been following their story for a while.

Immediately, Jessica picked Minny up and covered her mouth. More so than ever, this scene was hurting her quite a bit.

'I've lost‚Ä¶ I already know I've lost. Never have I ever seen that guy make that type of reaction, or look at a person in that way before.' Jessica thought. 'At least I can move on now. I should just think of Quinn as an unreachable Hero, like a superstar in a movie.'

"Alright everyone!" Peter shouted, clapping his hands. "Let's give these guys some space. It's clear that we are giving them a bit of stage fright. We'll come back and talk about this once you guys are done, just give us the signal."

Peter said walking off and everyone else went to walk off toward the other side of the lab as well, out of respect for the two of them. That's when they saw that Logan was doing something strange.

He had gone to one of his computer terminals and placed his hand on it. Then a couple of seconds later a screen appeared. On the screen itself, there was none other than Quinn and Layla.

"I have cameras all over my lab that I can access. They are in my lab so I see nothing wrong with doing this."

The others didn't say anything because they too were interested in what was going to happen. So instead they crowded around the monitor with their backs toward Quinn and Layla.

"Quinn‚Ä¶" Layla said being the first one to speak. "It's been so long‚Ä¶ so very long." Layla thought she could hold it back, but already now that the others were away, there were droplets of tears running down her cheeks, and a lump was felt in her throat.

"I‚Ä¶ I was so worried, so worried that I would never be able to see you again. There were days where I thought I forgot what you looked like. You‚Ä¶ you of all people in the world, the person I thought I would never forget.

"I felt so guilty that I was forgetting your face, and I'm not talking about the ones that they plastered on the statue, I'm talking about the real face that's in front of me now." She sniffled and wiped away her tears.

"Lay-"

"Let me finish." Layla said with her head to the ground. "I waited for you Quinn‚Ä¶ I waited and waited, waited for the day for you to come back, and then I heard you returned but you disappeared again.

"I had hope and it was chucked away. My heart was ripped out again. It was so painful for me, so painful that I decided to bury you inside of myself, bury you‚Ä¶ and try to forget about you."

Finally, Layla lifted her head, her eyes swollen from crying, tears still falling all down her face and her cheeks a little rounder than before.

"I‚Ä¶ realized I couldn't though, Quinn. I could never forget about you because I love you."Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

With no sound made after that, no footstep touching on the floor, Quinn was suddenly right in front of Layla. He had moved so fast and quickly she had no time to notice. Before she could do anything, he had hugged her pulling her tightly into his chest.

"Layla." Quinn said his voice was a little lumpy and shaky. "No matter what happened to me, you were always there for me. You were there at the beginning when I turned into this. You stayed with me even though I was different and you never hated me for getting you involved in all of this mess.

"Instead, you stayed by my side each time, and continued to try and help me in your own way. I heard from the others about everything that has happened, and I realize now. At any second, anything from our lives can be taken away.

"So I'm not going to hide how I feel, I'm not going to just wait for something to happen. I have to do things myself like I always have done and that includes my feelings for you. Last time I was unable to do this, but this time I will."

Quinn's fingers touched the side of her neck gently. Layla felt a force pull her forward and a tingling sensation could be felt running up her entire neck. The two's faces angled with Layla's staring into Quinn's. The next moment moving forward, Quinn's lips had locked with Layla's.

Two of them kissed each other, closing their eyes, longing for this long awaited moment.

"YEAHHHHH MY MAN!" Peter shouted as he started to clap.

All the others that were watching the video also began to cheer, on the sideline soon after Peter, at this joyous moment.
