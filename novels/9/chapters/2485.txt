Chapter 2486 Fight against the demon kings (Part 1)

Having rushed down to the ground below to chase after the man in white, what the group assumed was another demon king, they found themselves in a type of production area.

There were several giant tools, large mallets, working areas, melting pots and even giant crystals. It was the area where the Yaks used these tools to build the giant ships that were by their side.

They were at the very edge of one side of the large giant ships, and were looking straight ahead at the strange man in white.

"Remember, the only thing we actually need is his blood." Hikel commented.

"And how do you expect us to get something like that without killing him?" Peter replied back, still in his full celestial form.

"I'm going to have to agree with Peter on that one, it looks like our original plan of changing their memories isn't going to do so well." Russ was thinking back to when he had tried to touch the Yak king.

The red mist had condensed around the body, not allowing him to get close. Although a strong hit or a punch could get through and do damage, physically touching them just for a moment seemed quite impossible, unless they were dead of course.

Luce, the demon king, lifted his hands up and the several streaks of small white power came out from his hands. It looked the same as before, like a type of liquid rather than energy. It moved fast and it left behind a trail that lingered permanently in the air.

It moved around all of the large objects, through the small cracks and was heading for the group again.

Hikel went ahead, summoning his blood aura and fired it out toward Luce this time. He knew that his attacks were useless against this strange white power. However, the white dots moved to where the attacks were.

It had moved in a diagonal line and the attack crashed into it exploding on the spot. It did nothing, but it had blocked the attack and there was now a permanent diagonal white line in the air. It started to move in a zig zag shape and blocked the rest of the attacks in the same way, until what was left in the air was somewhat of a crudely drawn shield.

"This worked out before, so let's try it again!" Russ used his powers to first transform into that of the Penswi, he then rushed forward passing the main circular white light. Pulling out the sword from his side, his legs' transformation ended and he swung the sword down, touching the lingering white path that had been made.

When the sword touched one section of it, the entire attack had disappeared just like before.

'Although using this sword isn't too much of a problem in itself for me, it cancels out all my powers when I do use it.' Russ thought. 'If I summon anything, transform my body, or try to use any other powers, I can't with this sword.' T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

"I see, you are the most troublesome one, and the one I need to get rid of first." Luce declared.

Using his own power, and the power of the special armour that Edvard currently wore, he was able to make a large hole through the ship, from the bottom all the way to the top.

Chris quickly escaped through the hole along with Edvard, allowing the ship to crash to the ground, and the two of them quickly made their way to the top. It didn't take long for the Yak king, Bisha, to jump up from the ground and land on the ship again.

"I knew you two would still be alive!" Bisha shouted. "But now that some of you annoying little friends are being dealt with I can deal with the two of you.

Bisha slammed his foot onto the ground and a large chunk of it lifted into the air. The top of the ship seemed to be made of slightly different material compared to the hard substance that covered the outside.

The demon king then hurled the chunk, that was the size of a car, right at them. Sparks of fire were seen surrounding the object as it had been thrown so fast.

The first to react out of the two, was Edvard, as the armour pulsated through his body and he threw out a punch, not just a punch but one where his blood aura was mixed in with it. When his fist hit the object it was blasted with enormous power that ripped the object into several different sizes.

The armour gave one great power, but it took time for someone to know how to use it properly, a way where they could combine it with their own powers in order to deal the most damage, and Edvard was extremely capable of that, because he had practised with the armour a long time ago.

The vampire martial arts that the vampires were taught, a lot of it actually stemmed from the original, Edvard. The use of a blood punch, exploding the blood aura on impact, powerfully like a shotgun, all were developed by him.

Using this, combined with the armour effects, Edvard's punches were probably some of the strongest the universe had to offer. However, it couldn't be used in a simple physical way, such as the situation they were in not too long ago.

Chris had more strength, being able to stop the ship from crushing them. Holding it up on his own, was something Edvard wouldn't have been able to do.

Seeing the great power twice now, Chris was stunned.

'I thought, out of everyone here, that he was the weakest of the group. That I would have to look out and cover for him‚Ä¶ but that might not be the case at all.'

Bisha continued to hurl objects one after the other at the two of them, and Edvard was hitting them one after the other, turning them into nothing.

"Hey, are you really just going to make me do all the work, what was the point of letting you go out and eat all of these guys if you were going to do nothing!" Edvard shouted behind him, but when he threw out his next punch he felt no impact; it had only hit the air.

He had just been punching along to the rhythm of the tosses, relying on his ability for a while now. When turning his head, he could see that a giant mast had been broken off, and was in the hands of Bisha.

It was already mid swing, and the giant mast slammed into the two's sides. Their bodies went flying off in the distance and even the mast had been let go out of Bisha's hands.

The two were far in the air, until they crashed on the ground a few times, eventually getting up.

"Crap, that kind of hurt a bit." Edvard said, looking at his armour, he was worried about it since it technically wasn't his, but there seemed to be no major damage to the thing. Chris had gotten up as well but now was looking at where they were.

"We were hit quite far away." Chris was trying to see if he could recognise anything but it almost felt like they were hit so far that they were in a different place altogether.

Looking at the ground work around him, he noticed the strange giant wave hardened structures, and where he had seen them before.

"This was the place where the Yaks were going. Where they were harvesting their materials from." Chris said.

It was a strange sight to see, the floor itself looked as if they were in a agint frozen sea, with large waves that would tower from side to side but none of it was moving.

Sure enough, as Edvard looked far off into the distance he could see the giant ships as well, but that wasn't the only thing they could see. Just like before, there was something that was drawing closer to them in the sky.

Before they knew it, it crashed and landed right in front of the two of them. Shaking the whole ground.

"Hey‚Ä¶ is it just me, or does he look different from before?" Edvard noticed.

He was right, there was this strange red aura that was thick and covered the whole of Bisha's skin. The tusks that grew from the bottom of his mouth were now growing further upward to the point where it touched the top of his forehead.

On the Yak's skin itself, there were these strange swirling patterns that were on his chest as well.

"I'll kill both of you, for destroying my hard work!" Bisha exclaimed, now in his demon form.
