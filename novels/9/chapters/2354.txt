Logan and Agent 4 were able to have an easy time as they worked on the special symbols on the ground. The strange device he held in his hands was able to alter whatever was pre-written. 

When looking at the ground it almost looked like the strange writing was carved into the metal, but from the way Agent 4 was able to alter them, it was clear that they weren't. 

'These symbols are certainly strange… I do have quite a bit of knowledge that was left to me by Richard Eno about them… including the original symbols he had used to connect with Immortui, but when I'm looking at all of these it looks more complicated than back then… I need to keep an eye on Agent 4, although he has helped and worked with us. 

'There's a chance that since he worked closely with Zero, that he could be doing something to alter and help out the enemy side.'

While working away, Agent 4 himself could feel a pair of eyes locked onto him, watching his every move. 

'He states that he knows nothing about the runes, but I know that's not true.' Agent 4 thought. 'It was easy to add a few additions here and there when we were getting attacked by the vampires, but Andy has done a good job in getting rid of them.' 

Looking up, it was at that moment that Andy had joined the fight, helping the other originals as they had managed to finally kill Magnus. It felt somewhat unreal, as if he was going to move again, or perhaps turn into another form, but none of that had happened, instead he just stayed there. 

Both Edvard and Hikel looked at each other, their wounds healing. 

"Well, I have to say that you are one unlucky person to end up like that." Edvard smiled. 

The body of Magnus started to vanish into dust, it was breaking down into little particles. He was somewhat expecting to see a blood crystal but there was nothing in his place. 

"He really wasn't a vampire in the end huh?" Edvard said. 

"We have to focus on the goal, the portal, its still being opened, and now we have our path to Jessica." Hikel stated.

Tying up the last of the vampires, Andy went over to the two originals. 

"Thank you for allowing me to redeem myself. With that green liquid I had the power to overcome Magnus." 

"You are thanking us? You were the one that finished him off, there is no need to thank us, but we have to figure out what to do with Jessica? Do you think we should just pull her out from the centre?" Edvard asked. 

Hikel started to move forward, he thought if they at least removed her from the centre it would stop powering the device.

"Wait, don't touch her!" Agent 4 said, wiping the sweat from his face as he stood up. It looked like he had finished altering the very last of the runes. "There is a chance that if you move her, all of the energy will backfire and enter her body at once, if that happens, then you will lose her." 

Both Logan and Agent 4 walked over to the others while Hikel took a step back. All of this stuff was complicated for them, they didn't understand it and thought it was best that they listened to the expert.

"Then what do we do, haven't you already changed all of the symbols?" Andy asked. "And right now Quinn is still fighting above to keep them at bay. I thought that this was all meant to end when we defeated Magnus." 

"Let me deal with it." Agent 4 stepped forward holding the device in his hand. "What you said, about it ending when defeating Magnus, that might have been true to a certain extent. However, the way all of this facility was set up, it was designed to continue to work without him. 

"As if, Magnus and everything was all here just to buy time. What they didn't expect, was most likely that you have someone like me." Agent 4 said, as he walked forward. "It will be best for you to just stay back while I deal with this, just make sure those vampires don't break free, or that there aren't any other surprises." 

As Agent 4 walked over, he felt something climb up on his shoulder. Turning his head he could see a mechanical spider, and he knew who it belonged to straight away. 

"This shouldn't distract you from your work, and I would like to do more research into these runes." Logan said, with a straight face.

Quinn was continuing to battle the creatures that were pouring out, and things were actually getting easier for him rather than more difficult. Still, there was nothing he had gone against that was stronger than the greater demon, but that was until he could see strange creatures coming out. 

They were just like the others that had wings, as only winged creatures had broken through, which Quinn had guessed meant the portal had opened up in the sky on the other end as well. 

However, this one looked different from the others, its wings weren't feathers and looked more webbed. There was a strange pattern that looked like fish scales going across the wings. 

Not large or hard like that of a dragon but somewhat a similar design. The creature had a human-like body, but didn't look human at all, with its large webbed feet that looked like flippers, and it was the same for its hands as well. 

Then there was its dark coloured skin. It was a dark blue all over that stood out against the back drop.

A few of them flew out and due to the gut feeling that Quinn had, he felt like this creature was different to the others, and used the blood forest punch. 

The creature was able to act relatively fast as it turned its head and opened its mouth. In doing so, a dark blue energy came out like a vortex and hit the blood fist, but the blood fist was too powerful, breaking through whatever attack it had tried and hit the creature right on the head killing it in one go.

'The way these creatures are, they remind me a bit of the Mermerials, but they seem to be stronger than that.'

'So I the demons aren't all the same race, but then why aren't these creatures that I killed before considered their own race?' Quinn thought. 'If I remember correctly, the vampires were a creation of Immortui, so in a sense even we would be considered a demon race. 

'The vampires weren't the only variation of the demons though. So there will be plenty out there, but I'm still unsure what the other ones are, or why there is a differentiation between them.' 

While thinking this, more of the same creatures as before started to come out, they were all Freytlin demons like before. They were slightly different shapes and sizes, some bigger than others, or with longer claws on their hands, but it was quite clear they were all the same type. 

Unlike the creatures from before that were quite different. 

'I feel like something is coming, a type of calm before the storm. 

Coming through the other end of the portal, was exactly that. A Freytlin with a wingspan that was twice the size of the others with wide webbed feet that were twice as big as well, had come through. 

There was a surge of power around the demon, as it had come through the portal, and unlike the others that had passed through naturally, it looked like the portal was almost trying to reject this one, and he had forced his way through. 

Under his wings, and swirling around his body, there was dark blue energy all over.

"Let's see, where is this Quinn?" The Freytlin said, looking around, that's when a large blood forest fist had hit him right in the stomach. His aura moved in the way creating a shield to block the attack but it still managed to get through, sending him back in the air slightly.
