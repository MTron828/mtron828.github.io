Chapter 964 - Class of 2A

Looking at the two boys who were walking over, Erlen was wondering just who they were. He didn’t recognise them at all. He thought maybe they were some of the students that had gotten beaten up the other day. He didn’t recognise any of those that had helped before either but they were all pathetically weak.

However, he was a little worried that based on one kid’s confidence that they might be someone from higher up or one with a strong ability, but Erlen had made note of all those that he should be careful to offend. After all, he too knew how the current world worked and didn’t want to cause any trouble for the members of his family either. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

’Why is the guy next to him not as confident?’ Erlen thought.

Sil was trying to walk forward to stop the fight, but before he could, Chucky pulled him by the sleeve.

"Hey, I’m meant to look after you, I can’t just have you going into a fight where there are six of them, we should call someone or go get a teacher." Chucky whispered to Sil.

It wasn’t that Chucky was afraid of the students, after all, he was an a.d.u.l.t that had gone on far more frightening things, such as battles with deadly beasts while being in a faction. But he was a careful person, and having to fight while protecting another he didn’t know how hard it would be.

This was the first big mission he had been given by the Cursed faction and he wanted to make an impression. Although, unknown to him, Chucky wasn’t selected for any particular reason, it wasn’t because he was good, or strong, or had a good ability, it was due to his young looking face.

There weren’t too many in the faction that would pass off as high school students.

"Chucky," Sil said for a second. "I don’t like your ability." And after saying this he had his hand held out as if he was asking for something.

Reluctantly, Chucky handed Sil a round black ball from around his waist, a similar size to an egg, while keeping some for himself.

"You don’t want to kill someone. If you can, avoid doing that as much as possible. Once you do, you can never go back." Sil said.

"Kill, I wasn’t planning on killing him, I just wanted to make sure that he could never sleep in his dreams again without thinking about me!’’ Erlen shouted.

Chucky started to chuckle hearing this.

"Whoa, if you just wanted to ask him out, you didn’t have to go through all this trouble, there are other ways." Chucky couldn’t help himself but say.

"Looks like we need to deal with some others first!" Erlen said throwing out the ice spears at both of them, soon the other students started to move as well.

The first thing Sil did was throw the black egg towards the spear and when it hit, the spear completely shattered and fell to the ground, the same happened with Chucky’s throw as well, but soon the others would be upon him.

"What should we do? They came here to help us, should we help them?" Swin asked

Venus wasn’t too sure, the last time people from their class got involved it ended in all of them getting beat, and the other kids now stayed clear of both Venus and Swin. They were honestly quite surprised to see Shrio come and help them again, and now two other students from the class.

"Why, why are so many people helping us?" Venus asked, wiping away his frightened tears, when he looked up, Sil was tapping them both on the shoulder, but he was looking straight past them and at Shiro on the ground.

"Those words I spoke before, they weren’t aimed at him, they were aimed at you. Remember what I said." Sil spoke, and soon turned around to all those that were ganged up on him.

All six of them including Erlen had them surrounded.

"We have no choice, we have to fight!" Swin said, standing up.

However, Sil held out his hands, and a few seconds later, two of them were lifted off the ground. Putting his hands together, both of their bodies crashed into each other with such force, and flooped to the floor after. Straight after that, he lifted another one and slammed him against the glass ceiling, causing it to crack above and soon let go allowing him to drop to the floor.

"Whoa, wait what is this telekinesis ability! It must be close to level eight to be able to lift things so heavy!" Swin said, knowing full well due to him having the same ability.

"Now this is an ability I like." Sil said.

It made them wonder what those black egg balls were that they had thrown earlier, and if it was a beast weapon due to how it was able to smash the ice like that. What they didn’t realise was it had something to do with Chucky’s ability.

Looking around, Erlen noticed that all of his friends had passed out, he didn’t even see the others get hit.

’The force from that student’s power must have been strong to be able to do that!’ Erlen thought. Even if he didn’t want to admit it, he was a little afraid.

He had never heard, or knew of someone with such a strong telekinesis power in the school.

"Hey, look, you don’t want to hurt me, you know my da-" Before Erlen could finish the sentence, he felt a strong thump at the back of his head and his eyes went white and fell to the ground.

"No one wants to know about your dad." Standing behind Erlen, Chucky could be seen holding one of the black balls in his hand.

"Where did he come from?" Venus asked.

"Yeah I didn’t see him in the whole fight." Swin replied.

Chucky could hear every word the kids were saying and although he hated to admit it, as soon as the fighting started for some reason everyone’s attention had gone straight to Sil, and they were completely ignoring Chucky. He practically was able to run up straight behind them without anyone noticing and had hit the back of Erlen’s head. He had even taken out the other students with little trouble.

"Come on, let’s get out of here." Chucky said, and he and Sil were seen leaving the three boys.

"Wait, you’re in our class right!" Shiro called out to him, finally breaking out of his spell. "What’s your name?"

"I’m Sil." He replied, as he walked back and the two of them headed out of the room.

’I guess no one wants to know my name, huh.’ Chucky thought, feeling a little upset.

A short while later, the kids had gone over to Hayley to heal some of their wounds’ though they didn’t have any serious injuries due to what had happened, they were so small that even Hayley thought nothing of it.

When heading back to their dormitory, they were thinking about what to do.

"Should we tell teacher Hardy, he did tell us to tell him if anything came up?" Swin asked.

"No, teacher Hardy won’t be able to do anything." Shiro said. "I know what those kids are like, they probably attacked us because teacher Hardy got involved in the first place. If we tell, something worse could happen to us."

Shiro, wasn’t wrong either. As Erlen woke up with the rest, they were steaming with anger all over, and they felt like he had no choice, and he knew exactly what to do.

"Dad, there’s something I need you to do.....yeah I’m being bullied. It’s best if you come in."

It didn’t take long for Erlen’s parents to come to the school and call an emergency meeting soon. Erlen, the five kids who were with him, his parents and Head General Innu of the third group were all in a meeting room together.

"I understand." Innu said after listening to everything. "Don’t worry, I will speak to the second Head General, and have these students that did this to your kids, and his friends come in here themselves and apologise to both of you. This can not be tolerated in our school."

"Good!" The father spoke, standing up and straightening his high end tailored suit. "I especially want the boy named Sil and Shiro to be brought to us. They could have killed our child!"

Two names in particular were mentioned with great detail from Erlen when he told his story. Towards the end of the fight, as everyone was leaving, Erlen had managed to regain a little bit of consciousness, and while Sil was still there he didn’t want to get up off the ground, but he had heard the name of the student that had been spoken at the end, and he was sure to remember it.

Looking away from the parents, there was a smile on Inuu’s face. He had been waiting for a way to get back at Head General Hardy but didn’t know how, and he thought that this was now the perfect opportunity.

’Thank you kids of class 2A, and especially you Sil and Shiro.’
