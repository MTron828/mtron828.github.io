After disconnecting with the infected demon tier beast in the vampire settlement, Quinn opened his eyes. Although he could give the infected tasks to follow, especially intelligent ones that had a mind of their own, information passed on from them was a little more difficult.

He could only see this information if he went and accessed an infected mind, but then how would he know what information an infected had without searching every single one. This power, the evolved shadow was strong, but it was almost as if it was made for a mind more capable of holding all this information than him.

Which was why, he more so had information passed on to the infected demon tiers. They were in some cases like his generals in an army, just accessing their minds, or taking over them he could gather an idea of what was going on.

"Did you manage to have a nice little nap then?" Russ asked.

"I wasn't napping, I was doing something important." Quinn answered. For a long time, against all the enemies he had, he felt like he was on the back foot a lot of time. This time, Quinn wanted to be prepared more than Jim or Jack could ever think of.

"Did you manage to do what I asked?" Quinn changed the subject.

"Yes." Russ replied back. "After you showed me what to do, through your weird touching I can feel the energy from the crystal a lot clearer. I'm trying to drain as much energy as I can from the crystal‚Ä¶ it just hurts a bit."

Quinn did remember going through some level of pain when he had absorbed his first nest crystal but after that he was able to absorb others quickly and painlessly.

"Someone like you won't die, just absorb it as fast as you can. Otherwise, there is a chance that you might die to someone else."

Russ pulled out the crystal and was concentrating, but he couldn't help but not trust Quinn a little. He seemed to be a little restless as if he was in a rush, and how would Quinn even know that this wouldn't kill him, it wasn't like he had forced others to absorb a nest crystal before.

Either way getting stronger didn't sound like a bad thing, which was why Russ was sucking it up and absorbing the crystal anyway.

"Is there anything I can do?" Ceril asked while she was patiently sitting on her sofa seat.

Currently the group were inside the Dark Red's building. It was a whole floor that was dedicated to the professional team, coaches, players, and up and coming trainees were all located in one area.

While Jun was talking to his team, the group were told to wait inside one of the team strategy rooms which was what they were currently doing now.

"I want to help out as well. The Mermerial race might get involved in this whole mess anyway, and when the time comes I don't want to be useless. I know how strong the enemy is." Ceril explained.

Thinking about it, Quinn wondered what was best for her. She didn't have any MC cells so the nest crystals didn't have a direct use, but then again nest crystals seemed to be versatile. They had saved his own life, and they could also be used to indefinitely prolong a clone's life.

It would make sense if they could prolong human life as well, which was one of the guesses Quinn had to how Jack and Jim were still alive.

'Her blood control is great, just as good as the original leaders. I can't give her a boost in power with celestial energy like I could in the past. It seems like the best thing to do to increase her strength would be improving her blood aura, along with the blood control. The only way I know how to increase blood aura is through blood crystals and that's through a vampire's death, which I can't imagine coming anytime soon.'

In the middle of his thoughts Quinn hadn't quite come up with an answer, but he was interrupted anyway by the sliding door. Jun had returned and entered the room.

"Arghh‚Ä¶ man speaking to that old man always gives me a headache, I knew this would be tough." Jun said, shaking his head. "Look, I'll be honest, the Penswi don't like the idea of bringing in outsiders, unless they can be sure by bringing you on that they can win. I did my best to convince them, but from here on out, you will have to do the rest."

Through that explanation it was how Quinn and the other two had ended up in one of the training rooms. The thing was, while walking through the halls they had gathered the attention of everyone on the floor.

The trainees like Zallack all started to talk about the aliens that were trying out for the team. Soon all of the kids, the coach, as well as the other professionals on the Penswi team had gathered.

The trainees, including Zallack, were standing around the edge, some of them were pretending they were training with the multiple different types of equipment, while others were just staring at what was going on.

As for the coach, it was perhaps the first time they saw an older Penswi, the skin was still vibrant and fresh, but the eyes were darker, and the back of the Penswi was a little bit hunched.

"If it wasn't for the fact that Jun begged me to do this, I would have never even considered this in the first place!" The coach sighed and shook his head.

While the other professional team members went to the coaches side to try and calm him down. Just like Jun, the other professional Penswi that were on the team had a slightly more muscular build compared to just the regular Penswi.

The coach eventually shook off all of those trying to help him, just like humans it seemed that the elderly didn't like admitting they needed help or to be looked after when they needed it.

"Look, before we even continue with any type of assessment for all of you, the fact is that only five are allowed on a team. So you will all need to take part in the assessment, and not only do you have to get a score a little bit better compared to the others on the team, it needs to be far higher."

With all of that explained to them, the assessment was to commence, there were multiple different types of games, as it was explained that the event would require different members to take part in different events.

The thing was, at each event, only one person was allowed to participate, but a person could participate multiple times. This was why a team needed to be more balanced as they had no idea what the games would be.

It was also the reason why Stark took part in nearly all of the events, beating everyone no matter what type of game he went up against.

For the little test though, they decided to go with the button game that they had played before, since they already knew the rules for this.

The first one up was Ceril, she had performed slightly better than she did in the arcade as she had a feeling for the buttons and had come up with a more efficient way to hit those close rather than just going for what she could see, was moving in a way that allowed her to score higher.

However, at the end, her score wasn't so impressive, it would allow her to be considered for a professional team but to replace her with one of the other regular Penswi, there was no chance with a score like that, and the coach was just shaking his head.

Next up though, was Russ and he was sure to impress.

"You seem to have a better image of this Stark person in your head. You've seen him perform in person right, well that should help me out."

Just like before, Russ had transformed into a Penswi using the image of the great person Stark that was placed inside the coach's mind. He performed far better as he moved faster compared to before and managed to get a score that was above a 1000 on the machine.

"This‚Ä¶ is amazing, and he can change his body into the perfect Penswi‚Ä¶ his points are still lacking against Stark but I can see a light!" the coach shouted for joy, but his smile soon went away. "If only‚Ä¶ I had more time with him, then maybe we would have been able to train him to the point where he could compete with Stark."

The coach realised that Jun wasn't pulling his leg after all. Still, there was a smile on Jun's face.

"He wasn't the person I was talking about." Jun explained. "The person I want you to see an pay attention to, is that one."ChùíÜ√™ck out lùíÇtùíÜst ùíèùíêvùíÜlùíî on novùíÜl/bin(.)cùíêm

Quinn walked up to the game, and was wondering just how he should do this, and before starting the game, he asked a question.

"Am I allowed to use anything to hit these buttons as fast as I can, items, or powers of some sort?" Quinn asked.

"That is not a problem, any power is fine, as for an item as long as it's something that doesn't interfere with the game directly or touches the game directly then it would be fine." The coach explained.

Hearing this Quinn had an idea.
