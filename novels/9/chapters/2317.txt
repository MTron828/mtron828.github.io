Earth had become a better place compared to before, it actually had somewhat improved after Jack Truedream had come to rule. That was because he had invested a lot of his earned wealth, materials that had been gathered from other planets, and more to Earth.

In the original Dalki war, a lot of land mass had been destroyed through the initial attacks, but using land mass from other planets, they had restored a lot of land on earth, and more and more started to move there.

On top of that, due to Jim and Jack working together, it meant that vampires as well as humans lived on the same planet. It was strange in a way, the peace that Quinn wished to create did happen, even if they didn't remember him.

It was only their actions that led to most of their downfall and why Quinn had decided to get involved.

However, that didn't mean there weren't still problems that arose between vampires and humans.

On Earth, on a busy street in the city, a man in a suit was running as fast as he could. He was pushing through crowds not caring for who he bumped into. He was relatively strong because those he did hit on his way would get knocked over, not slowing his speed down at all.

This was because he was a vampire. Blood was dripping from his mouth and part of it was on his shirt and tie, as he ran he would look behind him a few times.

'Damn it, I can't see her, but I'm sure‚Ä¶ she has to still be following me.'

Straight up ahead, a group of people with weapons and armour on their body were in front. It was quite clear they were Travelers and wouldn't be pushed so easily even if he did run head on into them.

Because of this, he decided to take a left turn down an alleyway, he didn't know where he was going and just continued to run, until from above a figure dropped down right in front of him.

"Stop running away or it will only add to your crimes." The woman stated. "You are under arrest for taking blood from a human without their consent."

The vampire went to turn around, but quickly, running to the wall, the woman jumped off it, launching straight at the vampire and tackling him to the ground.

The vampire attempted to swipe his red long claws at the female, but she simply pushed the hand away. In the struggle, the vampire managed to wiggle his way out and was up on his feet. ALL new ùíÑhapters ùíên nùíêv(ùíÜ)lbin(.)com

He knew he couldn't run away, this woman was faster than him.

"Why are you doing this!" The man shouted. "We are the same, both of us are vampires, so why are you punishing me for something that is only natural and in our nature!"

"The Vampire Corps unit is responsible for all cases related to that of vampires. There are thousands of other vampires who are in the same situation as you, and they manage to control themselves. Blood supply is plenty, there was no reason to do what you did."

The man desperately ran forward, swinging his arm, but the woman was able to get in close and lift her leg high, kicking him right in the chin. She knocked his head back and jumped in the air, with the same leg she swung it down, hitting him straight to the ground knocking him out.

"And you're wrong, the two of us are not the same." She said.

A moment later, and three more vampires appeared where the two were, a blonde haired man with nearly swept back hair, and one other female and male vampire with short and long black hair.

"Captain Jessica, you can't just go out and run on your own like that, what if this vampire was part of a group. You know we need to move as a unit." Galanar said.

The three that had arrived were all part of the Vampire Corps unit. Compared to the past, their roles had evolved to be more integrated with human life. On top of being a military force to be used to defend Earth and other cities.

They also were now a force that captured vampires that commited crimes. Jessica was a little lost after splitting from Quinn, not knowing where to go.

She had attempted to become a Traveller but things seemed quite boring after the journeys she had, so instead she had joined the Vampire Corps under Andy's recommendation. She hadn't taken part in the war.

Many of the Vampire Corps didn't as it was believed that Earth needed some level of protection regardless of what was to happen. So not much had changed in her life in terms of forgetting about Quinn.

Apart from the fact that she was now a captain of her own little investigation group.

"It all worked out in the end didn't it? You always complain but it always works out, and besides I feel stronger when there's a larger group." Jessica replied, feeling her bicep.

"Well you know why I worry don't you?" Galanar said, bushing his blonde hair back with his hand, and titling his eyebrows while trying to squint slightly to make his face a bit more handsome.

"It's because I worry about my future wife." Galanar sprinted forward, to make sure Jessica could get a good look, but as soon as he did Jessica pushed both her arms out pushing him back.

"What did I tell you about getting so close to me!" Jesscia said. "Do you want me to write you up!"

"Ah, come on Jessica!" Galanar complained, shouting back. "It's not like you're taken. I'm sure you think about dating, every vampire does, most even have harems, but here I am with my eyes only on you."

"What about Quinn, Quinn doesn't have a harem?" Jessica folded her arms and turned her head.

"Yeah, but he's an exception, most vampire leaders would have several wives, anyway my point is I'm different from them, so give me a chance." The man said.

"Hey you two, let's just get this wrapped up." The other member said.

Stopping their argument, they started to move with Jessica at the back, she lifted up her hand toward one of her eyes.

'He‚Ä¶ didn't see it, did he‚Ä¶ I'm always worried someone might see if they get too close.'

Jessica had a secret that she kept from everyone, and that was the fact that she was a dhampir. Before, when she was in a rage or fighting against vampires, one of her eyes would glow yellow, but at some point the change was permanent.

She still had some contact with Logan, and he had managed to make a special contact just for her, that would hide her eye colour, even when it was glowing with power, but she was always worried someone would notice if they got too close.

Her dhampir powers though, were what allowed her to excel at being a Vampire Corps member, as she got a boost of power when going up against vampires. Still, she had no idea how others would react if they learned the truth.

After the case had come to an end, everyone was able to go home, and that was the same for Jessica. She lived on her own, in a nice apartment building, being a captain paid quite well, there was a good level of security, and one would have to have a special key to access the elevator.

Of course, if they were skillful they could bypass all of that, but it was so many extra measures and steps that it still made places like this safer. Entering her apartment door, she had a crumbling sound from underneath.

"Oh, what's this?"

She picked up the crumpled piece of paper, and realised it was an envelope, inside it there was a card. The card itself was blank on both sides, turning it over she could see nothing but inside there were words written.

"I will send you the most beautiful gift you have ever seen." Jessica read out.

She looked around the card to see if she could see anything else.

"That's strange, it doesn't say who's it from‚Ä¶ is this‚Ä¶ is this from Galanar. I guess he can be quite the romantic." Jessica thought, as she paid the letter no mind and placed it on her table.
