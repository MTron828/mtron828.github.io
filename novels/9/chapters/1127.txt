Chapter 1128 - Going a bit crazy

A lot of time had already been spent waiting on Blade Island, but there didn’t really seem like there was anything the group could do. Quinn was getting more and more frustrated with each passing day, especially now that there was a potential way to help Vorden and Raten.

He kept himself busy during his free time by reading through the notes that had been left behind about the abilities that Hilston had kept. Since they weren’t ability books he was unable to use the system to instantly learn the information and had to go through them the old-fashioned way. In those peaceful moments, Quinn felt reminded of being a student who was cramming to prepare a presentation for class.

Still, they needed to progress and move forward, so Quinn eventually went to Eno with a request.

Eno and Brock would usually spend their time on top of one of the castle’s four towers; today’s choice had been the east tower. As far as Quinn could tell the two older men seemed to be just staring up into the sky.

"The Dragon no longer needs to be moved, and a lot of time is being wasted. While we are just waiting here the Dalki out there are constantly out on the move. I think it’s best if we leave this place." Quinn said after he had arrived.

"Have you come here to ask me for my permission?" Eno asked without so much as changing his lying posture. "In case you’ve forgotten, you’re your own leader. The goal of this mission was to complete your side of the deal, but we have already agreed that it’s for the best to let the Dragon remain here. At least for the time being."

Quinn hadn’t forgotten the supposed hierarchy, but due to Eno being with them for a while, and him being the person Quinn had searched for for the longest time, it felt weird to just decide to do things without him. Besides, Eno always had something to say about Quinn’s decisions, so he was surprised to hear this now of all things.

"I’ve come here to inform you about our next course of action. So what are you planning to do? Are you going to come with us, or do you want to wait for the others?" Quinn asked.

"We will stay here." Brock answered as he sat up to face Quinn while Eno continued to stare out towards the sky. "Me and Eno have evaluated the Cursed faction long enough. There won’t be much of a difference with us being there or not, and at this point I think my master has something he would like to say."

Brock, then bowed down and stepped aside holding his hand out. Eno took Brock’s hand and got up, facing Quinn.

"Congratulations, Quinn. It looks like you’re indeed the one I have been waiting for. Now I don’t want you to get too big headed." Eno ’praised’ the Cursed faction leader. "After watching you for a while, you seem to have the talent to end up in all sorts of situations. Although I’m still not sure if I should say you’ve been blessed by a god of good luck or one of bad luck considering the constant things that you face."

"Now with the state the human race is in, you are really the only person I can trust to stop the Dalki. You’ve heeded my warning and you have many people around you that will help. You know what you need to do, when the time is right, I will have someone come out and seek you, but remember Quinn, you are to complete your side of the bargain no matter what!"

"When we need to move the dragon, you will do so with Sil’s ability or without it!"

The conversation was over, and Quinn was free to leave, but as he did, he couldn’t help but wonder what Eno meant by his words. Did he know what Quinn was planning to do? That he was going to try and bring back Vorden and Raten before moving the Dragon tier beast?

He somehow had known many things before that he shouldn’t have been aware of, but at the same time that knowledge hadn’t been omniscient.

’Richard did help create the system with me and Logan’s family.’ Vincent commented. ’He was also able to override it that one time, which means that perhaps he has a way to access your system and see everything you are doing. In some type of way.’

If that was true, then that was a scary thought to have. This system was what had allowed Quinn to grow stronger in such an incredible fast way. It had helped him along the way, but it was a fact that he didn’t have complete control over it. Perhaps one day it could be used against him, which made Quinn think if he would have to look for a way to get rid of it at some point.

’I’ll need to learn to be less reliant on the system. Even without it, my body can still work using most skills. Still there are some things like the soul weapons and more that I can’t use without it yet.’

In the past, it had been beneficial for Quinn to learn how to use the skills himself anyway, rather than relying on the system. It would solve the light delay in time that he had when activating skills through the system.

So it just made more sense for him to learn how to use the abilities properly. Unfortunately that required a lot of time, and how often was he really granted such a luxury? Not to mention there was so much for him to learn and do.

Now knowing that they were to head off the island, Quinn decided to head for the tablet one last time without everyone else. The dragon had remained there and now only half opened one eyelid to see who it was. As soon as he recognised Quinn, he closed it again and continued his slumber

’Who would have ever thought I would make a Demon tier beast grow so accustomed to me that it would just sleep around.’ Quinn thought amused.

He started at the tablet and checked his Quest log. There were two main quests still available for Quinn. One to find out what lay beyond a Vampire Lord, only levelling up was taking an incredibly long time these days.

He was also worried that this was something no other vampire had ever reached or heard of before, so when would he evolve again? Level 70? Level 80? Level 100? There were perhaps any other conditions the system wanted him to fulfill?

As for the second quest that was to find out more about the Talen family.

’How do I even start that?’ Quinn wondered.

When checking out his system, his eyes went towards one of the items that were there, something he still had no idea what to do with.

’The seedling from the Demon tier beast. I was thinking about putting it somewhere on the Cursed ship so I could observe it, but that might be too dangerous. It would be a catastrophe if it turns into the same Demon tier tree again.’ Quinn thought.

He could just try to plant it on the original planet it came from, but none of the inhabitants would want that for obvious reasons. Then there was Blade Island. Currently it was inhabited by no one but a large dragon and beasts.

In the middle of the open ground, Quinn dug a whole, and planted the seed in place covering it up. He really didn’t know what to do, or what he expected to happen from the seed now. He just watched it for a few seconds, and then, the ground where it was buried started to light up, glowing slightly pink. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

A strong life energy could be felt from it, but at the same time it was only a baby.

’Will this really grow into another Demon tier beast? I guess this island will be the best place to put it, it won’t do harm to the tablet, and even if the Dalki attack they would be in for a surprise.’ Quinn smirked at the thought.

For a second the dragon turned its head and got up on all fours looking at the area the seed was planted, it looked like it was about to do something, but then soon sat down.

’Did it not like that to put the seed here, maybe that guy from inside the tablet told it to calm down.’

"Hey big guy, I’ll be leaving now. Make sure you look after this little seed for me alright. You already protect the tablet so that can’t be too hard of a job for you, right?" Quinn asked.

The dragon blew through its nose once. Quinn had no idea if that was supposed to be a yes or no, but one thing was clear, it could somewhat understand what he said.

Going back to the seed Quinn placed his hands on it once again. The higher tier a beast was, the more advanced its intelligence seemed to be, so maybe it was the same with this seedling even though it was a baby.

"Grow up big and strong okay, and when I come back, try not to kill me." Quinn spoke to it softly.

The pink lights shined brightly for a few seconds then dimmed down again.

"I must be going crazy, talking to a seed." Quinn mumbled once he was a bit away.
