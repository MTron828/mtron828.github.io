The envelope was held in Jessica's hand for a while. She had yet to open it, but multiple questions were going through her head.

"When was this put in here? Was it before I even came to work, or was it here the other day? Did I open the drawer yesterday? I think I did, so this has to be a new letter... Wait, maybe I didn't open my drawer."

She was beginning to have second guesses but was wondering if that was because she wanted it to be an older letter. So far, the messages had somewhat linked up. She almost felt like if she were to read the letter, then whatever was said on it would end up being true.

Placing the letter down, she slid it back into the drawer and closed it, taking another deep breath.

"Let's not open it and just ignore it. I should just carry on with my life the way I have been doing. Everything has been going fine so far, so why would it suddenly change now?" she thought.

Although there was still a big worry over her head - how did it get there? It would mean one would have to be incredibly skillful to sneak into the vampire corps, or the most likely answer was that it was someone in the vampire corps in the first place.

"Is it a coincidence that I get this letter the day three new vampires turn up?" she thought. "The letters from my house could be explained with stalking, but for the one in my office... Maybe they put it in before I even got here... I did feel something as well."

"They were suppressing it well, but when I got up to each of them, I could feel the energy inside me rise a little. These vampires are no ordinary vampires. So the question is, are they all behind this, or just one of them, and why would they even do this type of thing?"

The more Jessica just sat there, her head continued to flip-flop. Nothing made sense, and she thought it was best not to accuse anyone either or jump to conclusions. She would just pretend the letters were never there in the first place.

When the others came back from the canteen, Jessica looked busy as she already had a load of work prepared for them all to do. They were looking over case files and were to try and make a report on how to make certain areas safer.

Others were working on public speaking scripts on how they should handle the public news crews and so on. Then the day finally came to an end, and everyone went their separate ways, or at least that's what they thought.

Standing on top of the apartment rooftops, with the night sky out, three people were looking down at a particular apartment. At least they were until Edvard decided to lie down and stare at the night sky.

"So what, you think that Magnus is the one who has been sending her these letters? Why would he do that? Was he meant to kill Jessica, and then when he saw her, suddenly he fell for her?" Edvard said out loud because the whole thing sounded ridiculous to him.

"At the moment, Logan hasn't given us any news about anything happening anywhere else. He has a close eye on the others, and no big events have happened regarding other cities," Quinn explained. "We don't know if it's Magnus or just a crazy person, but we have to assume anything at the moment while we have nothing."

"You mean it's the only lead we have right now. That is a bit suspicious," Hikel added. "It does make me wonder, though, if Magnus was able to get into her apartment, why not just take her away or kidnap her? Could it be they are after something else?"

"Or they're just waiting for us again," Edvard said, doing a sit-up and looking at the two. "Immortui could just be playing a game on you, Quinn. He seems to want to torment you more than anything."

"Maybe this time, he just didn't realize that we beat him to the punch. He's waiting for us to do something, and then wants to react."

What Edvard said actually made a lot of sense to Quinn because that's what he originally thought when Immortui was acting in the vampire settlement - pushing him further and further until he did as Immortui asked.

This thought reminded him, he had thought for a while now about something, and he felt like he had finally made a decision.

"I want to tell both of you something, something I have been thinking about for a while," Quinn said. His tone was heavy, alerting the others not to make any sarcastic comments at this point in time.

"Even if we stop Magnus, Immortui isn't going to stop. So after we do find Magnus and stop him, I've decided I'm going to stop Immortui himself."

Quinn was expecting the other two to act surprised, but instead, they just had a straightforward look on their faces.

"When you say stop, what do you mean by that... What are you planning on doing, and how are you planning on stopping him?" Hikel asked.

Quinn took a deep breath once more. Even just saying the words were hard for him, but he had already made the resolve to do this.

"I will make a portal, but not for Immortui to come to our world, but for me to go to his world instead. And while I'm there, I plan to kill Immortui," Quinn answered.

Once again, the two leaders had expected this, but it just seemed surreal. Was it really the only way? The only way to stop him? It felt that way so far, so they understood how Quinn felt.

Maybe if they had his strength, his confidence, they would attempt to do something the same. But for the two of them, they would never have a chance of taking down such a being.

"I've opened a portal there before, so there has to be a way for me to do it again. I mean, even Immortui thinks that's the case. All I need to do is close it when I'm the only one inside."

"But what if you never get back? What if there's no way out of that place?" Edvard said. "You're the key to get in, but that doesn't mean you are one to get out of there. Without you, we have no clue how to get in.

"How do you think your family and friends are going to feel if you're stuck there forever?"

"They will understand," Quinn answered immediately. "I am doing it in the first place for all of them. I don't plan to go in there and never come out, but I know that is a possibility. And besides, there are other problems as well."

Other problems Edvard wanted to say. There seemed to be many problems with this makeshift plan of his. That was when Edvard realized he was worried because he considered Quinn a friend.

If anyone else wanted to go away, go to their own death or sacrifice themselves for everyone else, then he wouldn't care. But it wasn't fair to Quinn. It wasn't fair to the man who had little time to himself, little time to spend with his family, to sacrifice himself for the sake of everyone else enjoying their lives.

"One of the main issues is that killing Immortui won't mean it's the end for him," Quinn explained. "One can kill a god, but they will reincarnate. The reincarnation cycle can be different each time, though.

"So maybe it will be a hundred years, maybe a thousand, or it could just be the next day he gets reincarnated. Still, there is a chance that when he does, he won't have his memories."

Although Quinn was saying all of this, that was if he killed him in the first place - the ones the ancient ones feared.Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

"Then the second issue. There is a theory that Richard Eno came up with. If we were to kill Immortui, all of his powers out there in the world would go away with it. Meaning, the vampires' existence would be no more."
