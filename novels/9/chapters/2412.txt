The armour that was on Chris, it started to crack in several pieces until it fell to the ground breaking into several smaller pieces and almost disappearing, turning into nothing. Now the only thing that could be seen was the red fur on Chris' bare chest. 

'The armour… the armour that I worked so hard for. No, not just me, but everyone worked so hard on getting the armour, to help me, and it's gone just like that.' Chris thought.

Beast armour when broken, could be broken into two different states. One of them just being a damaged state, if that was the case, then crystals could still be used to repair them, but usually one at the same level would have to be used, to the point where most thought it was pointless. 

Of course, a demon tier armour with a special active effect like this would be worth it, but the way the armour had been destroyed, it was gone. It had broken down into particles and there was no way for the armour to be repaired now in the state it was.

The armour, it didn't have a repair function like some of the traits of Quinn's armour. It had disappeared completely now, and with it a lot of hope that Chris had in the fight had gone. 

'How… How am I meant to beat him now?  If I was unable to beat him before with the armour. My current form, it can't last much longer either, I can't help but think that this fight is hopeless.' 

It was frustrating, extremely frustrating. All the training Chris had done, all the preparation he had done, to be defeated like this, and what was worse, was the fact that his opponent wasn't finishing him off. 

He was still standing in the same position, as if he was waiting for Chris' body to heal.

'How did he get so strong… how can I get stronger, strong enough to beat him.' Chris started to think as he stared ahead.

While staring, his sensitive ears could pick up the sound of groaning to his side. He turned his head, and to his right, he could see a Chrono still stuck up against the wall. The red energy was still pushing them against the wall. 

Some had died due to stray hits, explosions, and so on, but there were a few that still survived, and still had a strong will. They were trying even now to escape.

'A way to get stronger.' This thought was still strong in Chris' head and while looking at the Chrono, he remembered the words that Unzoku said. 

'As a werewolf, in order to get stronger I need to eat… I need to eat the strong.' Chris thought. 

The Chrono that had survived were indeed strong, and with Chris having never consumed anything of this strength before, he could only imagine what the results would be if he was to feast on the Chrono that were still there, still alive.

Without realising it, as these deep thoughts had entered his head, saliva was dribbling out of the side of his mouth, and this didn't go unnoticed by the demon king. He could see the look on Chris' face, having lived as long as he had, he knew that look well. 

'Yes, yes, yes! That's it!' Unzoku thought. 'That's exactly what you need, give in to your instincts. As werewolves, we always wish to grow stronger, to prove ourselves. It's natural, and the best way to do that is to feast!

'You have been holding yourself back for too long. I can't wait to see what you will become. You, who are already stronger than all of the Glutton class werewolves. If you were to feast, would you perhaps evolve even more? If then, will you be somewhat of a match for me, and if that was to happen, and I was finally able to feast on you, then even I will outgrow Immortui!!'

Hikel had created the blood whips, one of the creations of the past vampire king's that had absolute blood control. In the past, the book was passed from king to king and with it, all of the skills that the past kings had created would be passed on as well. 

The book had disappeared though, so Hikel never thought that if he did get the same power of absolute blood control, that he would also gain the knowledge of all the old skills that had been created. 

However, Richard Eno had recorded them all down himself. The information was passed to Logan which in turn was passed to Vincent. With that, he was also able to pass it all on to Hikel.  I think you should take a look at

Yet despite that, even with the blood whips, it was still proving incredibly difficult for Hikel to fight. Running forward, the whips swung left and right, hitting the werewolves before they could reach him. 

Most had hit, but the werewolves were fast and agile creatures. One followed from behind while another slid across the ground underneath the whip. 

"Remember these whips aren't the only thing I have!" 

Hikel had also surrounded his body and had, following along with him, several fist size balls of blood. They would be the next to target the werewolves instead. Still, the main problem wasn't the werewolves, it was Shinto. 

In the air, with the axe above his head, Hikel thought Shinto was an easy target, he swung the whip out to hit Shinto, who just swung the axe right at the whip, When the axe touched the whip part of the red aura broke off, making the whip shorter. 

It exploded as it had done all the times before, yet Shinto was seemingly unaffected by the explosion and continued downward. 

'What is his body made of to survive a direct hit? Not even condensed blood and my ability can hurt him.'

The wound on his body was taking a long time for him to heal as well, and he couldn't afford to get hit again. Stomping his foot, Hikel created another explosion underneath, chucking up large chunks of rock in the air, while running back as well. 

Watching the two fights, and dealing with the werewolves as much as he could was Russ. 

'It looks like the two of them can no longer fight these guys, both of them are in trouble. I need to help, but which one do I help first?'  Russ thought. 

As this thought entered his head, he could feel the air changing once again, but it wasn't changing from Shinto or from the demon king, it was from above. Looking up, Russ only saw a small figure, and suddenly it was right on the ground in the centre of the room. 

A small human-shaped man. 

"Tenbris, what are you doing here?" Unzoku asked, and the tone of his voice didn't seem to be pleased at all.

"I was sent here by Immortui… it seems like something is going on after all." Tenbris, one of the demon kings and one of the two right hand men of Immortui, said.
