Chapter 1267 - Wight Upgrade

. (The one with a purple cover and a werewolf boy on the front)

******

Using his head during a fight wasn’t really Peter’s strong point. Ever since he had turned into a Wight, he had strong emotions that would lean one way or another. These were to be aggressive or protect.

Anything that would make him angry, Peter would act on. If Quinn in particular was ever in trouble, he would risk his life without a second thought to protect him. Still, Peter himself had been noticing that his thoughts were becoming more natural as he started to experience more things.

The aggression was still within him. Even the most minor things would annoy him, such as people leaving their food behind in the canteen without putting it in the trash. Images flashed in his head of picking up the tray and whacking it across one of the members’ heads, teaching them a lesson so they wouldn’t do it again..

However, as he got more like his old self, it was as if his old personality of what he was like before and his new character were mixing to create something else.

’Who am I kidding? I’m just an angry person that’s started to think more.’ Peter thought as he was currently in the medical bay. Hoping to find some dead bodies. On the ship itself, there were even emergency caskets and some dead bodies that were kept just for Peter, but for some reason, he just couldn’t bring himself to turn one of them. His hand was held on one of the handles for a while now.

’I can’t...I can’t disrespect their bodies like that.’ Peter thought as he walked off, trying to come up with some other idea.

Logan’s suggestion was to make Wights and explore what exactly he could do with them. In the past, Peter had often relied on his strength so much that he never bothered making Wights from the enemies he killed because they just wouldn’t be much help to him.

On top of that, even if he killed strong enemies, they just didn’t seem helpful because what made them strong in the first place was their abilities. The two Wights he controlled would also constantly follow him around, which was a pain to him, and was why he would either use them as meat shields or forget about them.

Muttering to himself was just hurting his head more when suddenly he stopped in his tracks.

"Wait, did I ever try to.....that might work."

With the idea running in his head and not wanting to lose this momentum, Peter was seen running straight to a particular room. When he arrived, he could see all of the teleporters’ in sight.

"Hey, which one of these teleporters head to planet Caladi?" Peter asked the four or so guards that were in the room. All of them gulped as soon as they saw Peter. He already had a reputation for having a bad temper, one of the leaders they shouldn’t get on the wrong side of.

"It’s this one over here, sir!" One of the men pointed.

Seeing it, he smiled while walking over to the teleporter.

"Sir, do you have permission from Sam to use-"

"Shut up!" Where Peter’s following words as he placed his hand on the man’s face and pushed him away. "I’ll be back soon, so there’s no need for me to get permission."

With that, Peter had already gone into the teleporter and soon found himself in the Shelter on Planet Caladi. When arriving on the other side, the people there were also part of the Cursed faction, and they were also shocked to see Peter there.

"I know, I know, just tell Sam I won’t be here long," Peter said, and next, using his amazing speed, he was running off in the distance and soon found himself out of the Shelter and in the desert standing on the sand.

"Where is it....where is it." Peter kept searching as he twisted and turned his head. Realising that just looking wasn’t exactly going to help him out, he decided to just use his body’s instincts instead.

’This should work.’

Following naturally where his body wanted him to go, Peter eventually found the place where the Cursed ship had crashed on planet Caladi, where so many people lost their lives. But not only humans had lost their lives.

The area looked mostly cleared, with the human bodies taken away. Still, as for the Dalki bodies, they had remained, letting the sand cover them up or for the beast to take them away. Eventually, Peter started to dig in the sand at a specific spot and saw something dark and black.

Grabbing onto it, he used his great strength to pull it out of the sand, and a mostly intact Dalki was seen. Its arms and limbs were broken.

’When Quinn told us what the Demon tier amulet did, how he was able to control the Dalki and take down those motherships, it gave me an idea, maybe I can do the same. I can’t bring back beasts. I know that much, but my powers let me turn vampires and humans into Wights. Dalki are half-human, so there’s a chance this could work.’

Placing his hand on the Dalki’s chest, soon Peter something was felt leaving Peter’s body, the veins on his arm were showing as the energy passed through his arm, they quickly popped out and went back in again once the energy passed.

At that point, the Dalki’s body started to move again, its body slightly healing from the lesser Wights effect, and soon it stood tall in front of Peter.

"Yes...it worked!" Peter cheered and was so excited that he slammed his fist into the Dalki’s chest and punched its head clean soon after. It fell back in the sand and was unmoving again.

"Ah....well, I didn’t want that one in the first place."

Now realising his ability worked on Dalki, Peter started to dig through different parts of the sand again. Repeating the process as if he was looking for something, but not only was he looking for something, he was testing the limits of his ability as well.

As a Wight, Edward, the ex vampire knight of the tenth family, told him that he had to protect his head at all costs. He could heal any wound as long as his head was kept intact. When he was turned by Quinn, Peter was on the verge of death but not dead, and as a ghoul, he still wasn’t quite classified as an undead creature.

Only when he turned into a Wight did his heart stop beating, so it made him wonder just what the lesser Wights he created were. In the first place, they were only able to be created from dead bodies.

They were unable to use the abilities they had when they were alive but kept the same strength. They seemed a lot more like the typical zombies that one would know about from films, but did it really matter about their brain.

Peter soon found out his answer that it didn’t at all. For things had changed since the last time he had used the ability. Although he hadn’t gone through an evolution, it seemed like the effects of his lesser Wights were more dependent on him.

’It’s just like Logan said, even my Wight powers are evolving with me.’

Peter was looking at a Dalki that had lost its head which was now standing perfectly fine. It was a little strange, and Peter soon found out its limitations. The Dalki was able to heal wounds to a certain degree, just like Peter, but it couldn’t regrow parts of its body that it had lost before it had been turned.

On top of that, after enough damage to the body, unlike Peter, who could restore his regenerative abilities through eating flesh, they could not, and they would finally die, again. Essentially, they were like an item with durability but one that couldn’t be repaired, so eventually, he needed to replace it with a new one.

After many different tests, Peter still didn’t give up, and that’s when he finally found what he was looking for. Pulling out of the sand was a long sharp tail, meters long, and at the end of it were a pair of legs. However, the top half of its body was completely missing.

"This Dalki took way more of a beating compared to the others, but the bitch deserved it." Peter thought, hoping it would work.

It only took a few moments for the smile to appear again, as he saw the legs standing there and the Dalki tail they were all afraid of swinging about.

"Your name was Slicer, right? I guess your bottom half belongs to me now." Peter smiled as he quickly started to run back to the base, with a half Dalki body running after him, keeping up.

Of course, the lesser Wight Peter had created using the bottom half of Slicer’s body wasn’t as strong as her. For one, it didn’t have its whole body, and none of the Dalki Peter had tested on before grew stronger the more blood they split. So it was similar to having half a Slicer with no power up, but the important part was her tail which was still intact.

Entering the Shelter, the two ran straight back for the teleporters. Screaming was heard throughout the Shelter as people spotted the pair of legs and giant tail.

"It’s alright, she’s with me! The legs I mean!" Peter shouted, still smiling.

Because, now that he knew that a head wasn’t needed for turning those into a lesser Wight, he knew exactly who the next person he was going to turn would be and no one would care how he disrespected this body.
