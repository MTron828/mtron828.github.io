The red skin and fur of the werewolf standing in front of Sera looked fierce. The power was something he had never gone against before, and he could feel how alive it was, how much vitality it had in front of him.

It was almost as if all the attacks he had made before, the buildup of damage that had been built up from the fight, had disappeared in that instant.

Rolling on the ground, Sera managed to reach a large greatsword and pulled it out from the ground. He was ready to face whatever his opponent had to throw at him. That was until he had no clue where he was.

"Has he disappeared?" Sera thought.

There was a blur in his vision, moving about side to side. A clear view of the werewolf couldn't be seen. It was only because of the disturbance he could feel in his zone of power that he knew where Chris was.

That was why he knew exactly when Chris had gone to attack him. He lifted his greatsword up, and the claws of Chris and Sera clashed. Unlike the times before, though, the entire greatsword was smashed into several small pieces.

The energy from the claws, even though not directly aimed at him, continued forward, hitting his armour, and it was piercing right through until it was eventually reaching Sera's skin.

He could feel a great burning sensation as it got to him. With no weapons in his hand, he had to do something, and he had made his choice.

"This fight has gone too far for me now. It's no longer any fun," Sera thought to himself. "There is no longer any benefit if I help out anyway. The end is near."

Stomping his foot on the ground, several of the weapons on the floor lifted and started to come towards him. Chris, being cautious after being hurt by the mysterious man several times, backed out.

He wondered, was this one more attack, a great power just like before to match his red werewolf form? Whatever it was, Chris needed to beat it, and he needed to be fast about it because he couldn't keep up this form for long.

When the weapons touched Sera, they started to disappear, as if they were going back into storage. Suddenly, several of the weapons just fell to the ground, and when they did, Sera could no longer be seen.

"What the..." Chris turned his head left, he turned his head right, expecting Sera to come out and attack him at any moment, but he never came. The weapons that were on the floor, some that were still on the ground, no longer had the white glow.

"Tell me!" Peter shouted, running back to the fight scene, creating a dust cloud behind him. "Where is he? Where is he?"

"I think," Chris said as he started to cancel his red werewolf form but stayed in his werewolf form just in case. "He ran away."

"What? After all that, he just runs away. Who even was that? Why would he just... what the!" Peter felt like pulling his eyelids off his face.

They had no clue who that was. Their reason for interfering, and because of that, Peter felt like he could never repay this person for attacking them.

"His energy, it's gone... it's gone!" Peter shouted.

Not really knowing himself what he meant by that, but the celestial energy that was similar to Peter's felt in the area was no longer there.

One of the many abilities Sera had was to be able to know what was happening in the general area. It was almost as if he had a bird's-eye view of the situation. It was one of the skills that helped him win many wars, being a great tactician.

This was because he knew the movements of the enemy's side. It was more helpful than one would think in a large-scale war, but what he could see, there was no hope of turning around, not at least with his power.

The vampire leaders had managed to push from all sides. There were vampires and a few Dalki. All of them had managed to push the Amra back. If he had given it his all and won against Chris and Peter, then that wouldn't have changed the tide of the war, which was why as quick as he came, he left just as fast.

Geo had come back from the situation, and with him, he was bringing back Nock's body. In order not to dishearten the other Amra who were fighting, he did this secretly and asked the vampire controlling the demon-tier beast to put him away.

The situation they had come back to was worse than they thought, though. Thanks to Dober and the Forgers from the tower, they had managed to survive this long by setting up a literal wall.

Materials had been brought out from the tower, and in a mile radius around the tower, a wall had been made out of solid rocks. On top of that, there were rocks that had been given to the Amra.

The enemy was now coming at them from all different directions, and the Amra didn't rest. They hurled rocks towards the vampires while others fought on the ground and front line.

The owl demon-tier beast was seen striking, lifting up vampires, and hitting others with its long neck.

Once in a while, though, a large attack would happen on one section of the wall with the Amra as the leaders got involved with their blood aura attacks. But rather than going in all at once, they would back off after doing some damage.

"Do you not think this is cruel?" Edvard said, watching the situation. He was standing on top of one of the Amra houses from a slight distance. This way, they could give better orders on the attack.

For Edvard, though, he hadn't been involved in any of the attacks at all, and Hikel often stayed by his side. He was looking after his dear friend, who seemed to have changed so much after the attack on the Namriks.

"When a beast is cornered, that is when it's at its most dangerous," Hikel replied. "We have lost a lot more vampires than I would have liked. I don't wish to lose more. If we continue like this, concentrating on strong attacks, here and there, we will chip away at their armour."

Hikel's plan was working. The moment Geo reached the area to help, the main attackers would have disappeared, and he could tell his people were getting tired. Their numbers getting smaller, 1000, maybe 2000, was that what was left of the Amra now?

Seeing the enemy on the other side with their numbers unknown, it was a lot of pressure on their mental health. One of the Amra picked up a rock, and when he did, his arm felt incredibly weak suddenly, tears were rolling down his face.

"This is it... isn't it... this is the end for us. There is no way we can win." The Amra was disheartened, broken down, and a blood aura strike came toward him. He had almost accepted his fate until Geo stood in front, taking the attack.

"It's only over when we say it's over, and it is not over!" Geo shouted back.

At that moment, a planned attack occurred and the wall that had been weakened in several spots. The leaders unleashed a flurry of blood swipes with great aura towards the made wall. The rocks that were pushed from the base had fallen, the wall had fallen, and the vampires were now freely able to attack them.

The vampires were seen running toward the Amra people, and Geo reached out, wishing to help them all. Running past him, he could see several things collide right into the vampires.

A bull-like beast pierced a vampire with its horns and then started to chomp down at its neck with its mouth.

"Beasts..." Geo said.

It wasn't just one beast, but there was a whole army of beasts that had appeared behind the Amra. They were clashing with the vampires. Turning his head, Geo noticed that they were coming from the first floor of the tower, and it could only mean one thing.
