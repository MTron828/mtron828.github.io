Chapter Ôªø1866 Rejoin the others

Just like Quinn had done on the Amra planets, he wanted to do the same here for the Mermerial race. Although Quinn didn't believe it was his place to be involved in other's affairs, at the end of the day, he had already interfered.

This game of gods was turning out to be a lot more complicated than he initially thought and although Quinn still didn't have a set plan on how to protect Earth from these future threats, this was a start in his grand plan.

Placing his hand out, he touched the top of Wince's head that was still bowed down.

'The Amra race were able to take more celestial points than I thought. It might be the same here, the other races are naturally stronger compared to humans. The Amra had extraordinary bodies, and the Mermerials have the strong power to control water.'

The energy was being transferred into Wince and she could feel tingles all over her body. It was incomparable to anything she had felt before, as the cells all over her body vibrated with excitement. Her face was starting to turn red as pleasure was now felt over her body, and finally Quinn had lifted his hand, as it was over.

A mark started to appear, on Wince's upper thigh, on the outside. It was visible as she was wearing a sparkly blue dress with a slit where her legs were.

'It's as I thought‚Ä¶ the races can take a lot more celestial points.' Quinn thought.

[A dedicated follower has been created]

[Wince: 1300 Celestial points]

Although Quinn could tell that Wince could take a few more celestial points, here and there, he decided to stay on a nice round number. After creating quite a few dedicated followers, Quinn had learned the limits that people could take.

It was almost like filling up a water bottle, he knew when it was close to the top, stopping just before it spilled over..

"The power you have now is similar to the power that Yongu gave to the predators. What you have might be a bit different though, as I am also different from him. I don't know what powers you will have, but it would be best if you use it wisely.

"In fact, I would say only use it when you really need to."

Wince smiled at this, she wanted to test her new powers but wouldn't do so in front of Quinn. She knew he was busy and must be anxious to leave this place, because after all, that was all that he had asked for this entire trip. She was happy that he was able to go home after this.

"Take this." Wince said, as she handed him over what looked like a shell. That was it, it didn't look special and it certainly wasn't a beast weapon of any kind. "This is a communication shell and I have one as well. No matter where you are, the two of us will be able to communicate."

This seemed handy to have, but it made Quinn wonder how it was even possible. Logan was unable to create such things with technology? Perhaps was it something similar to magic? It was clear that the Mermerials also didn't have any abilities other than controlling water. It just showed how vast the universe was and all of the powers that existed out there.

"Will you be leaving now?" Wince asked.

"Not yet, there is one more thing that I need to do. Do you mind coming with me?" Quinn asked.

It was a strange request but at this point, Wince was treating Quinn as her god, a person she needed to follow and comply with in order for her race to continue thriving.

Quinn had claimed that it was a private matter. They had travelled by a strange pod-like ship that the Mermerials used to travel on the surface of the sea. Everyone was there, but when they had reached the beach, he had told the rest to stay there, while only the two of them walked to the city.

'What‚Ä¶what does Quinn want, why is he walking me along the beach, and asking just for the two of us‚Ä¶it couldn't be, could he possibly be planning to..' Wince's face started to turn bright red, as she thought of the things Quinn might do.

"We are here." Quinn said.

Her hands covering her face, shaking her head from embarrassment, Wince had failed to see where they were at this moment and time. Lifting her head, she was left with her mouth wide open.

"But‚Ä¶ but how?" Wince, eyes were filled with tears in an instant, her legs were shaking, and her vision was now blurry. The next moment, she started to run across the beach and with all her strength she leapt up, crashing into the other person and pinning them on the ground.

"This is real, you're alive, you're alive‚Ä¶ but how?" Wince asked as she was now on top of her sister Ceril.

"I'm so sorry." Ceril eventually replied, wiping her own tears away from her face. "I'm so sorry, I got involved with the predators‚Ä¶ it was me, it was my decision, but I want you to know that I would never betray you. I would have never done anything to hurt any of the Royal family, especially you big sis." It was hard for Ceril to speak, as she kept on gasping for air in-between her words, but every word that was said was true.

Embracing in a big hug, Wince wouldn't have even cared if she was under the control of the strange predators.

"I'm happy that the two of you are together," Quinn said approaching. Standing right next to Ceril was Dogthu and Nog.

The two of them were told to look after her by Quinn for the time being.

"Your sister, she has a lot to tell you, and I apologize in advance, but it was the only way I could save her." Quinn stated. "I will leave you two together."

Quinn walked off with Dogthu and Nog, allowing both Ceril and Wince to talk to each other and say their goodbyes. Because Quinn had turned Ceril into a new type of subspecies he couldn't risk leaving her here.

Ceril seemed to have understood and her wish was to explain to her sister and say her goodbyes, and would now travel with Quinn from now on. The same mistakes that appeared on earth, couldn't be repeated here, even if he had to break up a family, he would do so.

"I wanted to thank you for your help back there," Quinn said to the large Dalki. "I know you don't know much, but our two races had a Great War, but I had a Dalki friend. You remind me a lot of him. There are a lot of questions that I wanted to ask you.

"About whether there are more of you, how you got your powers, but I know that you won't be able to answer them. However, what I did want to say was, I hope that the two of us don't end up fighting in the future, like in the past."

Dogthu smiled, and turned around.

"Trust me, I don't want to fight someone like you. After seeing how much power you have‚Ä¶ it would be a tough battle for us." Dogthu replied.

There wasn't much for them to say after that, and Wince had returned after a long talk, around an hour worth. She then came over to Quinn, held his hand, and said thank you.

"Thank you, I just wanted to say thank you, because of you, I have another chance to meet my sister again, and say thank you." Wince said.

After that, it was finally time for them all to leave. Everyone had gathered on the beach. They were ready and so was Yongu.

"Alright, first we need to enter my space, and then I will transport you to earth. My transportation skills are quite poor and for some reason, I always end up in the sea. I'm afraid there is no other option."

"Wait, the sea!" Quinn shouted.

Before he could say anything else, Yongu activated his white space and it was time to transport everyone back.
