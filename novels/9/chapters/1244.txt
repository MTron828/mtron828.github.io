Chapter 1245 - Fixing The Issue

The timer was ticking down, and twelve hours wasn't enough time for Quinn to exactly go hunting. Although the teleporters were up and running on planet Caladi, the teleporters were no longer working on the planets that the Dalki had taken control of. They were assumed to be destroyed.

The remaining planets that were still owned all had motherships that still had the jammers on board. The worst thing of all was the fact that Quinn was on a green portal planet. The highest tier beast that would be found here was an intermediate tier beast.

It looked like in the end, Quinn had no choice but to give the system something.

'Arghh, this countdown is torture. If I have to get rid of something, I might as well decide now.' Quinn thought.

He had taken off the gauntlets and placed them both on the table in front of him and had done the same with the Demon tier amulet. The gauntlets both had a strong passive and active skill in each of them. If it wasn't for the poison, perhaps Quinn would have struggled more with Agent 2. At the same time, draining mana was undoubtedly handy, even against the Dragon Demon tier beast.

However, how could he possibly think of getting rid of the Demon tier amulet when he had only just gotten it. With his stats having been lowered, the amulet was good in many ways. He could possibly travel to other planets where the Dalki numbers were few and obtain a few Marked.

Quinn still wanted to perform his little test to see if he could evolve the Dalki himself, and then when needed, he could use them to boost his energy beyond the stats he lost. Even if the Dalki would no longer fall for his trick, he just couldn't see himself getting rid of it.

"I guess it's going to have to be the gauntlets then." Quinn sighed, but a thought came into his head. 'Does it have to be both of them? I know the gauntlets are a pair of weapons, but I can wear just one of them and still use their active and passive skills. In the first place, they were created with two Demi-god tier crystals. Maybe just giving one of the gauntlets would be enough?'

The only problem was, Quinn was a little worried that if he made the offering, then maybe he couldn't take it back. If that was the case, then he would have given up the gauntlet for nothing.

'What am I even worried about, I can just offer one, and if that doesn't work, the system would have taken them both anyway.' Quinn thought.

In the end, Quinn had decided to offer the poison gauntlet. Although the passive skill on it was strong. It was too unreliable, and there was only a chance it could work. Quinn needed something more sure rather than rely on luck or chance, so he decided to keep the energy draining gauntlet.

Picking up the gauntlet, Quinn started to think about the timer over his head. There was a ding sound and then a short wait. As if the system was trying to decide whether or not it would accept just one gauntlet instead of two.

[The item has been selected]

[Are you sure you want to give up this item?]

'Does that mean it worked?'

He didn't want to do it, but he had to select the yes option in the end. A few seconds later, the gauntlet started to turn into particles, disappearing the same way Quinn could store crystals.

'It is a loss, Quinn but remember you have gained a lot more from the system than losses. There might be a chance in the future that you are able to get the weapon back from the system.' Vincent said.

This was what Quinn was worried about as well. With the quest and stakes of the world getting harder and harder he had seen a penalty for the first time. Would this become a regular thing? If so, then if Quinn started to fail these quests more and more, they would only get more difficult.

Still, looking on the bright side, Quinn placed the energy drain gauntlet back in his dimensional space. It just meant he would have to get Alex to make him a new one.

'I was thinking. I know using blood crystals is considered taboo. However, you have already created blood weapons from the others in your faction.' Vincent was trying to get at something. 'When I saw them using their weapons and how effective they were against the Dalki, I was thinking, why don't you create a gauntlet out of the blood crystals.

'You have your soul weapon that acts in a similar way, and it gives you great power, but your soul weapon can only be used when there are multiple Dalki. If you were fighting against another five spike, then it would have been handy to have a powerful Blood weapon in hand.'

It was a good suggestion to make. However, Quinn didn't have a large blood crystal that he could use to create a significant blood weapon. He had already given all the blood crystals away, but even then, it was just better off for him to create beast gear that would give him more stats than a medium grade blood weapon.

'It would have been good if we had gotten Cindy's blood crystal back then. I doubt that Bryce has done anything with it. I'll keep it in mind if we ever do come across one.' Quinn said. Feeling a little bit better after only having to give up one of his gauntlets.

'I haven't heard from Leo and Erin in a while. It would be best to see if everything is okay where they are and how things are doing in the vampire world.' Quinn thought. 'I thought that there would be some type of reaction when we announced ourselves as V, but there was nothing at all.'

'I agree that is certainly strange.' Vincent said. 'I'm sure Bryce has his eyes on what you are doing. Although the situation was unavoidable, perhaps they had decided to let it go. Still, I actually prefer it when we know what they are doing good or bad. When things are silent, I worry the most. Especially since we haven't seen or heard of Arthur moving yet.'

What Quinn didn't know was that currently, Nathan was also on his way to Planet Caladi, and he wasn't alone. With him, he was travelling with Ruby and would be delivering the news of what he had learnt, as well as something special he had with him.

While Quinn had been busy deciding what item to give back, the rest hadn't been slacking off either. In particular, the Blade family. Other than Quinn, they were the second highlight of the war. In good ways and bad ways.

Since the world had learnt about them, their feelings were constantly changing. They hated them for killing Hilston, then thanking them for defeating the five spiked Dalki. The public felt like they were on a rollercoaster of emotions. After finishing helping build the Shelter, they were now helping out Logan with the ship's repairs.

It was good for them because they wanted to get away from the people in the Shelter. At the moment, they were having a break and were sitting down in the sand, where the ship was being used to give them all shade.

During this time, it was a little awkward between the group. There was Pai, and Vicky, the newcomers, who had decided to stay as they had nowhere else to go. It was actually an offer from Vorden. Then there was Sil, Raten and finally Borden as well.

Soon though, the silence broke as Pai asked Vorden how he and Raten had gotten into such strange bodies. The one thing they wanted to avoid was talking about Hilston.

"So that's what happened, you guys must have been on some crazy journey, and it must be weird having a beast as a body," Pai said, looking towards the two of them.

"What about this one?" Vicky pointed at Borden. "Why does he look like Sil, and is he a Dalki?"

"That‚Ä¶might be a difficult question to answer," Vorden replied awkwardly. Because then he would have to go into detail of how they had discovered a Dalki creating a lab on a vampire planet. In a way, too many crazy things were happening to them all.

"So, are you two going to stay with us, or are you just bored or something?" Raten asked.

Both Pai and Vicky looked at each other with a guilty look on their faces.

"We aren't quite sure," Pai said. "We think that we should help out with the situation as much as we can. To payback for what we have done, but we think there might be another problem that needs our attention.

"The Chained that were with us, all of them are free now, and that's not a good thing. Some of them have stayed in the Shelter and are going to be sent back to their families, I heard, but not everyone that Hilston kept with him was good. Some of them had dangerous abilities and were criminals.

"Hilston kept them for their abilities, but in a way, he was helping the world as well. People that could be considered for the position of the big four if they had the support and families to back them up. We might try going around and capturing them."

Hearing this made Vorden smile. He always knew that Pai and Vicky were good people. Even if they didn't stay with them, he wanted them to do things based on their own choices.

"Before you go." Sil finally spoke. "Tell me‚Ä¶I want you to tell me, why did Hilston‚Ä¶why did he do all of that, the Blade island, training us everything."
