The first event that started to move the cogwheels on the political landscape of the Earth was the Chained Wedding. It was an event that was talked about by the entire human race for a while. Several videos had hit hundreds of millions of views and were all being watched daily to get as much information as possible.

It was the first time a powerhouse was taken out, defeated in front of the whole world by a new group no less, and against such a small number of people as well. This had told the world that no group was safe.

However, even after the crushing defeat and many switching sides at the end, the Chained didn't cease to exist. Those in the Blade family still saw it as their mission to capture the unruly Chained. Their ancestors still chose to use their powers in cruel and harsh ways.

At the same time, those who were part of the Chained before and had left were finding it somewhat difficult to live a normal life. If they tried to join a faction for fear of angering certain people, they didn't accept them.

This was common, and because of this, the Chained had gone back to their old ways, forcing people to help them. Still, there was a question in public and the chained members' minds.

What had happened to their leader?

The leader was known as Russ to the world, and there was no footage of him during the wedding. After seeing how he was forcing a particular woman to marry him, the world viewed him as an evil vile being.

Some said that this was the reason why he hadn't appeared, others theorised that he had been killed off during the wedding but no one was there to see it. Since there was no confirmation Russ's name would be passed around from time to time.

The truth was, Russ was still alive, and he wasn't living the spectacular life he used to in his faction days. Using a robe to cover his face; he had managed to live by joining factions and hunting beasts.

He lived quite a good life in terms of a traveller, but it wasn't the same life he lived before. A short while after the wedding, Russ walked enter his room as he usually did after a long tough hunt.

The only thing was there was an uninvited guest in the room, standing by the window.

"I never thought I would see you again. I thought you would have completely abandoned me after I was useless and used for your goal." Russ commented as he took off his robe and went to lie on his bed.

"Used you?" Bliss replied. "I helped you, without me you would have never realised the true potential of your powers. Remember I was the one that introduced her to your team."

Her response made Russ frown. He wasn't bothered by the response, but rather by her body language.

They had seen each other on and off a few times, and during all of those times, he had never seen Bliss act this way. Right now, she was agitated and flustered, but at the end of the day this wasn't his problem.

"Ah yes, and now without them, I have an ability that takes up far too many MC points if I was to go against someone strong. Leaving me with an ability that is mid tier at beast." Russ complained.

"Mi- tier? Do you have no clue just how strong your ability is? You have a power that is able to take down gods!" Bliss said, getting more agitated. "But I understand your frustration, and it's part of the reason why I have come out here. I have a way for you to grow your powers."

Suddenly, Russ was no longer lying on his bed as he got upright. Ever since then, he had wondered if he would ever be the same as he was before. Would he ever be able to feel the same power as he had done when fighting against Quinn Talen? It was hopeless, and on top of that, his revenge against the Blade family would never be complete with the power he had at the moment.

"I see that caught your attention." Bliss opened a small portal with her hand and pulled out a Crystal. "This here is what is called a nest crystal, and we are going to use them to get your powers back to the way they once were."

After that, Bliss taught Russ how to absorb the energy of the nest Crystal in order to increase his MC points. She had given him three Nest crystals in total, boosting him from the current way he was.

That was all she could give, though, and claimed that the rest was up to Russ, but also gave him details of how to get Nest Crystals. With this there was a goal in Russ mind once more, and he began to work as a traveller.

He rose through the ranks, joining larger and bigger groups discovering Nest crystals on the way. There were times where there was also news of other groups discovering Nest crystals.

When this happens, a mysterious robe figure would visit them, and their group would be no more as a nest Crystal was taken. Most people had no clue what to do with them and it felt like to Russ this was a cheat that only he had, something that he could take advantage of.

In the first place there weren't many that could even get to a nest crystal with their power they would need an entire army but for Russ it was the easiest thing in the world.

Eventually though, his betrayal and antics had caused Russ to go to a quieter planet, to go into hiding and travel from there, which had brought him to the planet Venus. A planet that was covered in meadows and had plentiful small little villages.

It was one of the few planets that had next to no beasts on it. There were the occasional beast that would escape from time to time, or be brought back, but other than that it was a peaceful place,relative to the people that lived there.

For a while Russ had decided to lay low. What he had found was rather than doing all of the work himself, it was easier to let the higher factions get an inkling to a nest Crystal, or discover one and take it from them.

Following the news forums, he could see when they were recruiting a large team, and it was always for the same people, and for the same pattern.

"Good morning Dean!" A jolly woman said with a nice smile as she watered her planets hanging outside her home.

"Good morning miss Fern!" Russ waved back, walking through the village. His appearance had slightly changed from before, but it also seemed like the people that lived here didn't care about the news.

Since Russ would only go out when there was word of a Nest Crystal then come back from time to time this place had come to his base, and the people all got to know him. And he got to know them all.

After all, there were only 200 or so people in the village.

"Ah someone help, a beast a beast!" A woman wearing a dress shouted as she ran across the stone paved village. Shortly behind her there was a large balck cat with razor sharp teeth.

Seeing this enter the village, everyone panicked, there was hardly anyone who would deal with such a thing, that was until, the large cat suddenly started to swing at the air, and eventually it had collapsed just like that.

When it did, there was a certain person standing behind.

"Dean...was that you?" Fern asked.

"I used to be a Traveller but..my fighting days are over." Russ smiled.

The people were thankful, they were praising him, and would shower him with gifts as this continued, but it was then when looking up at the sky, a bright white light could be seen twilight from above.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî
