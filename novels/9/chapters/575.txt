Chapter 576 Moving on

Seeing the notification screen, Quinn prepared himself for the worst. There was always the chance that someone could be turned into something hostile. If Quinn was correct, he had an idea of what Linda might turn into.

There was once a similar situation in the past, one where someone was close to death, Peter. For him, he had turned into a ghoul, needing to feast on the living in order to evolve and live.

Moving on the ground, on the first inspection, she looked no different. Her body was moving fine, but Quinn could hear no heartbeat.

[You have created a basic Draugr]

[Draugr: An undead creature that possesses superhuman strength. They contain super healing abilities and have possible evolutions in the future, which will allow it to gain new abilities unique to the Draugr. Its natural nature is snappy as it has a short temper.

Its strength is on par with its creator. However, it will not scale as the creator gets stronger. All other stats are half that of the original creator. Must feast on human flesh to evolve and heal but is not necessary to consume. If never fed, it will continue to live as long as it remains uninjured.]

It was as Quinn had guessed, it was another category B subclass. But he was relieved. He had saved her, and it looked like she wouldn’t try to kill everyone on site.

Now off the ground, she placed her hand on her neck, the wound had completely healed. She looked at Quinn for a brief second, and then her other hand started to fiddle somewhere. Before the others knew it, she had grabbed her dagger and leapt towards Kazz.

Fex had reacted the quickest tying his red string around her arms in an attempt to hold her back, but he soon found out even with the red string she was too strong. While she carried on moving forward, he was being dragged along the floor with her.

"Yep, just sit there and watch guys, it’s not like a little help would be appreciated," Fex said, grunting.

Still, she was slow, and Fex’s string was slowing her down. Quinn had eventually recovered enough to stand in front of her and hold her back.

"Linda, what’s wrong, are you okay?" He asked. Thinking if there was anything in the description he had missed. Why did she suddenly try to attack Kazz?

Linda screamed in anger. "Quinn, I am in your debt. I heard what you said, I know what I have become I can feel it. I can tell I’ve changed, but I can’t blame you for this. You killed the emperor tier, and then you saved my life."

Thier were no tears or sadness in her voice. Instead, it seemed like there was just pure anger pouring out of her. "But her, she tried to kill me! She slit my throat. How can I stand here when the person who hurt me is right there! How do I explain to my brother what I have become."

"Well, it’s simple." Kazz replied. "You don’t. Otherwise, I’ll do the same thing I did to you, to him."

Turning his head around, Quinn was now the one who had snapped. "Shut up!" Quinn shouted.

It was so fierce that Kazz had jumped back and raised her hands. In her head, she had imagined Quinn attacking, but there was no such thing.

’What the hell was that?’

"Calm down, Linda." Quinn siad, with his eyes, still glowing red, and a strange feeling was felt in her body. She felt compelled to listen and follow. "Good, believe me, Linda, I didn’t want any of this to happen. Not again, and I understand how you feel - I really do, let’s just take this one step at a time."

Usually, Linda would have thought about things and not acted so impulsively as she had done, but there was a strange anger inside her every time she looked at Kazz.

"Quinn, I’ll keep your secret. Not just to protect you, but to protect the people I care about as well. But that bitch better watch her back." Linda said, nice and loud so she could hear.

Looking at Sam and what just happened, Quinn himself was having second thoughts about turning him, but he had no choice.

"Kazz, we’ll do the other one back at the base." Quinn wasn’t asking, but this time he was telling her. "Linda was an emergency, Sam’s can wait."

"And if he tells anyone about this, what are you going to do then?" Kazz asked.

Quinn turned around and looked at her.

"Well, then you will just have to try to kill me for spilling the secret, won’t you."

For the first time since she had come here, Quinn had caused her to get goosebumps. This feeling of dominance one person had over another, it was only felt to her from other leaders, which Quinn never gave off before until today.

She hoped he was joking about those words, but he was dead serious.

’It looks like I might have to make an in person report soon.’

There were still a few problems they needed to sort out before they could even think about leaving the area, and one of them was on their way.

"Linda, Linda, can you hear me, please reply are you all okay?" Blip asked.

"Blip!" Linda replied. "I’m...." She paused for a second thinking of what to say, before she finally replied. "I’m okay, we’re just recovering for now."

"Hold on, we’re coming to area four, we’ll be there in about half an hour." Blip said, and the transmission ended there.

"Quinn, what am I, am I like you?" Linda asked.

"We don’t really have the time to explain. I promise when we can meet up, and I can go through it with all with you, I will. But there’s something more important right now. You might not be able to tell, but when one is turned, they lose their ability. There’s a chance that you can still learn your old one. Some abilities are compatible with both humans and vampires.

"However, you’ll have to relearn it from scratch again. For now, it’s best if you don’t take part in anything that would require you to show your ability. Otherwise, the people at the base will find out." Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She paused, closed her eyes and tried to transform, but she felt nothing. Her heart had sunk in that moment. This was one of the more daunting things for her, one of the realisations she was no longer what she once was.

Her family ability, the ability that she and her brother shared, it was why they had called the whole faction the Crows in the first place. Still, there was hope she would still have the same ability.

"That should be fine," Linda replied. "After an event like this one, I don’t think we will be going on any big expeditions anytime soon. Besides I mostly do admin work these days anyway."

The next thing they needed to sort out was Kong’s body. Quinn went over to it first, and with his finger, he dipped it in and took a few drops of blood and placed it in his mouth.

[AB + Blood type consumed]

[+1 Stamina point]

Kong had been killed, and Quinn was unsure of when it had happened, but there was no chance of saving him. Honestly, he was starting to wonder if he even would have. With his slots filling up quickly, he would have to start thinking about those he wished to turn and those he didn’t.

He wasn’t a complete saint that could just go around saving everybody. For Linda, he had still thought things through. She would make a strong ally where they were currently, as co-founder of the faction. She could even help them move around and find out even more information.

But Kong, he wouldn’t have been able to provide anything.

"We need to get rid of the body, maybe we can just bury it and say it was eaten by a beast or something." Quinn proposed. That’s when he noticed that Linda’s eyes were being drawn over to the body.

It reminded him of Peter again.

"I’ll do it." Kazz said, while walking past Linda, she had snatched one of the Daggers from her hand, too quick for her to react. Then standing in front of the body, she started to strike at it. The king-tier dagger had sliced through the bone and the rest of the body like butter.

Quinn noticed though, was even though she was moving so fast the blade was actually cutting multiple times. One strike had caused at least five to appear on his body. He had seen this happen before as well, with Bryce.

’The first leader’s ability, it’s a strange one.’ He thought.

Eventually, the body had been minced up so much, it really did just look like mincemeat on the floor.

"Linda, I hate to do this to you, but it will be easier this way," Quinn said, shaking his head. "I order you to eat." His eyes glowed red.

He had used his influence skills and at the same time, her being part of the same family she felt like it was something she had to do. On top of this, her new body had natural urges to go in.

But she was more strong-willed than Quinn thought. She didn’t complain, she didn’t ask what he was doing, but instead, she just did it.

Once the body was completely gone, all they could do now was wait for Blip and the others.

[Status]

[Level 33]

[0/ 204,800 exp needed]

[Strength 50]

[Agility 50]

[Stamina 43]

[Charm 46]

With no equipment on, these were Quinn’s current stats. With the two level-ups from before, he had put a stat point into strength, making it hit fifty, then placed the other two into agility. Now that these two were at fifty, he would focus once again on increasing his charm points to the next level.

It seemed like he might be needing it here soon after all if he was to continue to comply. The reward for killing the king tier and the emperor tier beast were lacking, and honestly, Quinn was a bit disappointed. Other than the instant level up and exp, he had received nothing else.

However, he couldn’t be upset for long, as right now in his system, he contained both the king tier crystal and the emperor tier crystal as well. Currently, the highest level of equipment he had on him was the advanced tier gauntlets.

A smile appeared on Quinn’s face, as he couldn’t stop thinking about what equipment he would get from these two crystals. It looked like it was time for him to visit his old forger friend Alex Way.
