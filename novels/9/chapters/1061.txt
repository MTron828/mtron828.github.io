Chapter 1062 - Level up Blood

A distance away from the Shelter, inside the forest, a couple of men could be seen up high in one of the tree’s that emitted a green hue. These were Ko and Ely. They were both from the Orbus faction and had started it together. Ko became the head of the faction, while Ely became a vice leader.

Right now, it was heartbreaking what they were seeing. As they watched the Shelter, the two of them built up being overtaken, but they weren’t being overtaken by beasts or anything like that. It was the Marked. More missing people continued to flock in, and the small sparks of fighting around the Shelter were dying down bit by bit.

"What are we going to do?" Ely looked at Ko. "I’ve followed you for this long and will continue to do so,"

Ko didn’t answer and continued to watch the Shelter. He still couldn’t believe that somehow the Graylash had been Marked. When did it start? They had been at the faction for a while now, coming and going, and even more of them had come before the Cursed faction due to the war.

’What started all of this?’ Ko started to think.

They couldn’t see what was going on in the Shelter. It was too far, but what they could see was the giant pink tree, and suddenly. Several lightning strikes started to fall from the top of it, then a few seconds later, they shot up from the ground one by one.

"Quinn, he said he was going to deal with the demon tier beast. Are they fighting near the tree? Why were they in the tree?" Ko said out loud to himself.

It was at that moment he remembered something when Robin had first arrived. He seemed to be fascinated by the large tree. He would continually look at it, even attempted to study it, but then that fascination one day just disappeared.

"The tree, that Damned tree has been the Demon tier beast this whole time, the thing that we built our Shelter on! Just because...we thought it would look nice." Ko shouted in anger, but Ely quickly placed his hand over his mouth, warning him that there were still Marked and others in the area. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

’It’s my fault. Why didn’t I notice sooner? Wasn’t it my decision to make a Shelter and the faction base here as well? And now everyone is getting hurt.’ Ko thought.

"I’m going to destroy that damned tree!" Ko said. "I hate to admit it, but Quinn is strong. Stronger than anyone else here, but it also means that the demon tier will do everything it can to stop him from killing it. We need to use this chance to destroy the tree ourselves! We know all the routes to the Shelter. If we’re careful, we can get through without being spotted." Ko said, looking at his friend.

His friend looked nervous. Ely had already seen his life flash before his eyes when they were surrounded by the beasts. Still, now they were charging into danger.

"I already said, didn’t I, that I would follow you," Ely replied.

The two of them quickly descended from the tree and were careful about their steps. It looked like the area they were in had the least amount of Marked. It made Ko wonder if Quinn had put them there on purpose or if it was a coincidence. He also didn’t understand how someone was able to tell all those beasts were coming towards them from so far away.

Nonetheless, he was happy about the situation he was in currently. The Shelter gates weren’t the only entrance. There was also a particular underground tunnel that he had created. Originally it was meant to be used as a tool for escaping, not breaking in, but it could be used both ways.

They headed far out from the west wall as Ko searched through the forest for the escape route. Finally, they spotted the special entrance in what looked like a giant stone.

"Wait!" Ely said, pulling Ko back before he charged into the underground tunnel.

Their secret tunnel didn’t seem so secret as Ely spotted that Marked was already entering.

"If that demon beast really is a giant tree and is controlling the others, it will know about all of the entrances and secret places we built. It might even know this Shelter better than us." Ely explained.

"Damn it, then we’re just going to have to sto-" Just as Ko was about to make a reckless decision, his grip on his sword loosened, and his body stood upright,m looking at the two about to enter the tunnel.

"Cammie! Carole!" Ko shouted and soon went running after them.

’What is that idiot doing!’ Ely thought.

As if the two of them could hear their names being called, they turned to see off in the distance someone with their hand reached outward. The girls opened up their mouths’ and dribble started to fall, and soon their eyes started to glow brighter.

The next second, both of the girls were charging their way, running towards the both of them.

"I knew, I knew they were alive!" Ko said.

"If you don’t snap out of it soon, then you’ll be the only one that’s dead!" Ely shouted as he kicked his friend in the back to cause him to stumble before pulling out a crossbow and firing two beast arrows towards them.

"No!" Ko shouted. He pulled Ely’s leg causing his shot to go off balance slightly.

"You can’t hurt them. They’re my family!" Ko said.

However, Ely knew that at the moment, they were not the family he remembered, and if they were to progress forward, something needed to be done.

"I’m sorry," Ely said.

——

Just under where the pink tree was, Quinn could see what he was up against. Strong members of the Graylash family were chosen to fight against the demon tier beast, and on top of that, a head general of the Graylash.

’Careful Quinn, I’m sure you can feel it with your Qi, but all of these have been infused with the Demon tier’s beast power. Just like the Marked, they will be several times stronger than they were before.’

Quinn didn’t resort to activating his beast gear just yet, he had the legendary set on, but for now, he wanted to use the stats they were currently. After all, activating his active skill could only be used once every hour. After that, there would be a significant drawback, and the armour would be useless.

He needed to gauge their power, but he couldn’t use the shadow either.

"Looks like I’m going to have to fight like a vampire!" Quinn said as he ran forward and went for the Graylash members towards the sides.

"You’re a fast one, but I already knew you were fast, and I know you can get faster from when you killed the moth," Robin said.

The next second, lighting strikes came out all over, aiming towards Quinn. At first, he thought he would have been able to avoid all the strikes with his current stats, but the lightning strikes were coming out far faster than he had predicted.

"These guys are juiced up!"

His fingers started to glow red, and the blood was seen rushing to his hands. On his skin, his veins started to shine slightly red, running up his forearm.

[Skill activated]

[Half of your HP will now be consumed]

[50/100HP]

[Blood barrage]

Throwing his hands out, with the stored energy, and using his own blood, a barrage of smaller blood swipes came splitting out. Soon they could be seen multiplying as they went through the air, each one of them hitting the lightning strikes dead on.

The attack was a lot weaker than that of a regular blood swipe, but it covered a far wider range, and Quin had another advantage. He also could power them with Qi making them stronger.

Hitting the lighting strike dead-on, the first line of blood barrage only stopped the attack, but as more came, they pushed forward and would overpower them, pushing it back and continue going forward.

Robin seeing his men about to get hurt, decided instead to step forward.

"What that move this guy has....Lightning Storm!" Robin shouted as he punched both his hands into the ground. Lightning shot up like roots in front of his people. It was like a wall of lightning strikes, and the red aura would fade as they continued to be hit.

"It looks like you don’t just have fast legs and have been hiding a few things," Robin said.

The skill Blood Barrage was learned after Quinn had managed to upgrade his Blood swipe to level 5. Just like Eno had explained, Quinn’s skills could level up to 5, and once they did, they could evolve into new skills like blood barrage, and at the moment, blood barrage was too weak only being at the level one stage, and using it took a lot of HP.

’That lighting is strong.’ Quinn thought. ’And I can see he is even wearing beast armour underneath those robes. Suppose the Demon tier really is making their body superhuman. In that case, this is going to be like fighting a vampire leader with the power of lighting, one of the strongest powers the human race holds.

’The good news is, blood barrage wasn’t the only thing I learnt!’
