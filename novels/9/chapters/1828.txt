Chapter 1829: Sea beasts. (Part 1)

Both Sil and Doguth looked at each other. They both were waiting for the other one to take charge as to what to do next. After all, from the brief look around it looked like there weren't any other hydro stations in the area.

According to what they had heard from Wince, every city would have several hydro stations to allow them to quickly travel to other places. So where were they now?

"There is no use in us doing nothing. Why don't we follow the person from before and ask him some more questions about this place." Doguth looked around, but it really didn't seem to be a single person alive, but maybe searching through the ruins they would find something.

There had to be a reason why a hydro station even went to such a place, in the first place.

"Why don't we just wait here? Don't you think that would be the better option?" Sil asked. "I mean, eventually someone else will come out of the tubes after us right?"

While the two were talking, Dogthus was noticed that the fishmen that looked somewhat like a crossbreed between a human and a turtle was still floating deeper and further away into the ruins.

If they decided to stay now, and no one else came, then they might never get thier chance. Using his large tail and kicking his legs without saying anything else to Sil, he went off into the deep sea ruins.

"Shouldn't we stay? And isn't there some way we can go back in the tube and reverse it?"

"Maybe we could just follow the hydro tube back to the start, that would take us to the original station, wouldn't it?" Sil thought, using one of his abilities that drastically improved his eyesight as if it was a camera on several times zoom, Sil followed the tubes with his eyes, and he soon could see gigantic large creatures. ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

Swimming in the large deep sea, they had multiple large eyes, strange spikes sticking from them, and teeth among other things. These deadly sea creatures were the size of mountains moving underneath the water.

"All of them look to be the same size at that Hydra I faced. What is with this place? Is it just full of demon-tier beasts or something?" Sil thought.

"How have this Mermerial race managed to survive on these planets for so long with these things in the water. Either way, Quinn did say I should keep an eye on the Dalki."

Spinning the water in the palm of his hands, Sil was able to move quite quickly. It worked like a propeller. It was still relatively hard for him to move from side to side and other parts of his body.

"There they are!" Sil spotted Doguth and the turtle. He started to head towards the two.

"What did you mean when you said people go here to die?" Doguth asked blocking his way. The turtle moved towards him crashing into his chest.

"Would you please move... please? You should understand. After all, you are in the same place as me." The turtle replted.

"Well, we are here by accident, so please talk to us, otherwise I'm afraid I would have to stop being nice." Doguth stated, raising his hand and making a fist, trying to somewhat threaten the fishman.

The turtle started to laugh.

"Please, if you could end my life then that would make me happy, and I am very sorry to hear about your circumstances. If you are here by accident, then your fate is sealed like all of us."

"My family are gone, I no longer have friends, and my wife has left me. I am afraid I no longer wish to be here."

The next second, the turtle was dragged suddenly through the water. The Dalki attempted to reach out and grab him but was too slow, and all he could see was something had wrapped around the turtle's waist and pulled him into the deep dark sea.

In the ruins, there were several items that would create a light source for them to sea. Making everything a slightly blue hue, but beyond the ruins, there was just the darkness of the sea.

"What happened?" Sil asked, having just arrived. "It looked like something pulled him... it reminds me of what I saw before, in the hydro station."

Sil gulped, and he didn't even want to use his ability to see what was off in the distance.

"Did you find out anything from that guy? How to get out of this place? Anything?" Sil asked.

"I think so," Doguth replied. "But nothing that's going to help us out of our situation. This is a place where people go to die."

"When people no longer have the will to live, they come here. And I'm guessing that creature that just grabbed him must be the reason."

"You're saying that they come here to just die and get eaten by a giant fish," Sil said.

"How could the Mermerial have a place like this? It's almost encouraging people to give up. There has to be some reason for them doing this."

Rather than think about the situation or answer Sil's questions, once again Doguth was on the move. He swam right to where the strange turtle had been taken.

"This Dalki, is he not scared? And I don't understand what he's doing." Sil thought.

"Even if we find what killed the turtle, how is that going to help us get out of this place? Killing the beast will do nothing."

The two continued to swim through the ruins, looking at all of the destroyed buildings. They were relatively close to the sea floor, as they could see several items buried in the sand, including treasure and pearls.

It was hard for them to know how long everything had been down here for and they had yet to find anything. Finally, the Dalki decided to tread on his feet, on the surface of the floor.

"What's wrong, isn't swimming faster than walking?" Sil asked.

"Yes... but I fight better this way," Doguth replied.

At that moment, out from the sand, two large tentacles dark grey in colour rose up crashing through the ruins. It had easily destroyed them not slowing down. It was clear that it was the same type of tentacles that had grabbed the turtle from before.

Both of them at the same time came whipping down towards the Dalki. Sil could see this and had his hand ready to throw out an attack.

"Wait, let's see how he deals with this." Sil thought.

Raising both hands, the Dalki took the tentacle hits head-on and bent his knees, Sand from the ground floor was kicked up everywhere, but the Dalki still had a firm grip on either end.

Grabbing hard, his fingers dug into the end of the tentacles and blood was dripping out from them. Still, the tentacles had some level of strength to them. Even the Dalki with his great power looked to be somewhat struggling until he turned his head towards them and his eyes started to glow up.

A red lazer came out from them, hitting part of the tentacle, slicing it right off. He turn his head, the lazer from the eyes hit the other tentacle and the same thing happened again causing the other tentacle to fall.

"These guys were hard to deal with before they had abilities. Maybe Lazer Eyes isn't so much of a problem, but imagining a Dalki with the same powers as someone like Owen."

"I understand now why Quinn wants to keep an eye on them."

"It looks like you vanquished the great beast, so let's get out of here," Sil said standing by his side. "Let's spend our time trying to figure out how to get back."

"Can't you smell it?" the Dalki replted. "The smell of blood is coming from over there."

Staring in the direction of where the Dalki was looking at, in the distance, past the end of the ruins, there was a large dark outline that was part of the sea. It looked like a mountain in the water.

Soon though, rumbling from all of the ruins was felt. The entire ground was shaking and what was left of the buildings was starting to fall one after another.

"An underwater earthquake?" Sil wondered.

It was then, that the giant dark figure that could be seen in the sea, suddenly had two red glowing dots, and hundreds of large snake-like shadows could be seen.
