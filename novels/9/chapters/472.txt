Chapter 473 A lost god

The sun was burning brightly as it usually did on the planet. There seemed to only ever be four types of weather here. Hot, Very hot, Wet, or dry, and today was a scorching hot day. The large trees, plants and beasts enjoyed the weather all year round, but for some, it was torture.

The shelter on the planet was located in a spot where it was surrounded by large trees, and the area had been cleared out in a circular fashion. It was designed this way to hide themselves from beasts as they had plenty of cover.

The shelter wasn't a large one, with only a population of around five hundred or so people. Still, today they were in a happier mood than usual. Most of the living areas, shops and so forth were located up high in the trees. Large round platforms were made that contained shops and living areas. Part of the inside of the tree would be used as well for more space and storage. If one needed to get between each platform, they would need to use the solid wide wooden bridges.

The reason for their happy mood was for the first time, they were finally able to expand. They were starting to build on the ground floor, connecting all of the areas, from the bottom to the top.

They mostly used part of the abandoned military base that was on the ground before, changing it into their style. The organiser of such a big project was Ruby, the leader of such an establishment. She had golden-brown skin and her hair was braided down to her waist.

She always had a strong air around her, and a certain confidence. There was a reason why people chose to follow her. F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

"That's it bring it down slowly and just place it over there," Ruby said, as the people were building a type of lift to get from one place up to the other. They didn't have much of the technology that was back at earth, and they currently had no known way to get back or travel to other planets. So for now, they had to make do with what they had.

"Hey has anyone seen Minny?" Ruby asked as she looked around.

"I think I saw her go off with Arthur a little while ago." Another replied.

Hearing these words, Ruby was satisfied knowing that Minny would be safe. If there was one person she trusted her own daughter to be with then anyone, it would be Arthur. It was thanks to the mysterious stranger that had arrived that they were all alive today. He had defended them from beast attacks multiple times, and not just once but continually.

It was because he was overlooking and protecting them, that they were able to start the expansion project. Living up high was thrilling, but it was quite cramped, so space down below was needed.

For saving them, he had asked for nothing in return apart for them to treat him as one of their own, and now the others saw him as some type of fo guardian.

Not too far away from the shelter, there was a river, and currently, Arthur was there with his large blade in hand while Minny was sitting on a boulder watching him.

"Hey, Arthur, how come I never see you use your sword when you're fighting beasts?" She asked.

She had seen him practice his swordsmanship every day, but whenever he would have to fight a beast, he would use his bare hands, and only once had everyone seen him use the shadow. The others assumed it was an original ability so there really wasn't any need for him to explain himself, and thanks to Ruby if anyone was a busy body about it, she made sure they didn't ask.

"Its because this thing is as useful as a big stick until it's activated," Arthur replied.

"Activated, then why don't you activate it?" She asked.

'Because it needs human blood' he said in his head but chose to ignore her and continue his daily training. His body was still stiff since he had come out. He had no frame of reference for how long he had been asleep for. Initially, he wasn't planning to stay here. His goal was to find out what happened to his people, and who was the one that had woken him up.

The problem was, it looked as if there was no way off the planet. There were no spaceships, no portals, nothing. There was one thing he could do, but he chose not to do it unless it was his only way off this planet, and his body was close to a hundred percent.

Besides, he was actually having a good time with the people here. Still, he couldn't say the same for the weather, as at most he could bear it for two hours before he needed to go back into a shaded area.

"I still don't understand why they took that ring, it would have been really helpful right now." Arthur said.

"What was that?"

"Nothing, come on lets head back, my two hours are up."

When returning to the shelter, everyone welcomed him with open arms, and they would often bring him gifts such as fruit and such. Unfortunately, Arthur would always deny such gifts and the only ones he accepted where meat related. This was for obvious reasons that the others didn't know about.

Minny had run back off to her mother, while Arthur had gone back up to his living area. He didn't need to climb up. Instead, he just squatted down and jumped up to one of the platforms.

"That still amazes me every time I see it." Ruby said.

They were used to Arthur performing feats that were unattainable for a human. Some of them even thought he was perhaps a god or a friendly humanoid beast, but whatever he was, they were thankful.

On the highest platform, Arthur's house was placed, they had given him the biggest building in the whole shelter. He refused, saying he preferred cramped places to sleep in, after all, he had been in a small chamber for his eternal sleep. But they didn't believe him, and in the end, he had no choice but to accept.

In his house, this day was meant to be like any other at the shelter, he had expected nothing special to occur, but then, a strong smell had entered his nose. A scent he recognised instantly among all the humans. It was the smell of another vampire.

'I didn't expect someone to try and come get me so soon.' Arthur thought.

Outside, both Leo and Erin were being held by multiple spears. The thirty or so people that were busy working away had immediately grabbed their weapons when they saw the portal. They were quick to act as they had been training for it. Ruby knew that someday Arthur wouldn't be with them.

She could see it in his eyes that he had something more important going on and to do, and one day, he would leave them. So they needed to be prepared.

"Are you with the military, why have you come back to this place?" Ruby asked.

"We are not with the military, we thought this place was abandoned, so we decided to come here." Leo replied.

There weren't many that would have access to an orange portal. Other portals would have led them to other areas, but only the military portal would have placed them here in this shelter since it was a military shelter. She wasn't buying it.

"What do we do, Leo, do we fight?" She asked, having her hand almost touching her weapon, but Leo hadn't replied, for he was far too distracted by something else.

With his ability, he could sense enormous energy. An energy too great to even comprehend, not only that, but it was one that he had felt before, that he had felt underground.

'I thought it would have left, or gone somewhere else, what's it still doing here.' On top of that, now that it was outside and above ground, Leo had noticed something else as well. The colour of the energy, it was purple, the same as his and Quinn.

Before Leo could even decide what to do, the immense energy was already standing in front of them. He had jumped down from above, and Erin was wondering just how a human was able to survive a drop from so high without breaking or shattering their legs.

Arthur took a look at Leo and mostly ignored the girl beside him. He was trying to see if it was a vampire he recognised. The power in him was quite strong just for a regular vampire, so perhaps he was related closely to one of the thirteen families, Arthur thought. But unfortunately, he didn't recognise him.

"You, what family are you from?" Arthur asked.

To be honest, Leo had thought he might have had to get into a fight with such a person almost instantly, and the sudden question had thrown him off a little. He didn't even know what he meant by family, but he seemed to remember a couple of things that Quinn had told him.

"I'm part of the Cursed family." Leo replied, waiting to see his response.

'Cursed family.' It was a name he really didn't know. Had things really changed so much since he was gone? Usually, family names hardly ever changed unless a single family had completely gone extinct. They would then call upon a new branch of vampires to be created forming a new family. But this was rare. While thinking about this, that's when Arthur spotted something else.

His eyes started to light up as he asked his next question.

"You, where did you get that ring?" Arthur asked.
