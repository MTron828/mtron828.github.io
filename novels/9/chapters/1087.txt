Chapter 1088 - Owen's Soul weapon

The four spiked Dalki known as Green Horn and Owen were quite a distance away from the others. The remaining Dalki were seemingly ignoring the battle between the two powerhouses. It was hard to tell whether this was due to the high trust of the Dalki in their commander... or the lack thereof.

Behind him, Owen could hear the sound of fighting from the people he had trained, looked after and had asked to fight by his side. He desperately wanted to turn around and help them against their enemies, but he recognised that the biggest threat that they needed to get rid of was the four spiked Dalki in front of him.

The reason why Owen took a glance behind him was to make sure that he had ample room without having to worry about injuring some of his men with his soul weapon. Concentrating deep within, a glow started to appear in his hands. His long hair that was normally so defiant to remain straight no matter how much he used his powers was now standing and spiralling out of control.

The thing forming in his hands resembled a ball at first glance, making it hard to tell if it was an item based soul weapon or an enhancement type. Either way, it was clear to see that the ball contained several sparks of lightning inside, making it fizzle like crazy.

Green Horn attempted to take a step forward, but the very next second, lightning shot out. The Dalki was barely able to move his foot back, before the shot collided with the ground, scorching it black.

’What is that thing? Do I need to break his form of concentration to get rid of it? But if I get too close to it, it will just hurt me like it did before.’ Green Horn pondered over his next course of action. He was more cautious than the typical Dalki, but this was mainly due to knowing what had happened to One Horn in the last war.

Looking past Owen, Green Horn started to grin, bearing his sharp teeth he stormed forward. He seemingly charged at Owen, but then abruptly changed direction to go around the other.

"I was right!" The Dalki started to laugh as he saw the desperation on the other’s face. "Your attack might be powerful, but it requires you to remain standing on your spot! Your strikes may be dangerous, but I don’t need to go after you just now, I can always deal with you later!"

As for where Green Horn was intending to go, it was naturally towards the rest of the battle that was taking place behind them.

’My soul weapon might have some downsides, but there are ways to make up for it!’ Owen thought as he threw the ball as hard as he could into the air. When it was around ninety meters up in the sky. He then threw his fan up in the sky piercing the strange lighting ball, and attacked it with his blue lightning.

The ball seemed to be charging up, and when it reached its peak, it exploded into a group of clouds. The clouds were dark and full of power as they spread out striking the ground beneath them constantly.

Green Horn, seeing this was in range of the clouds, and was avoiding some of the strikes that came from above, by the skin of his teeth, until eventually one hit him. It shook his whole body with great power. It was painful but the lighting strike hadn’t dealt him a lethal blow.

’That guy, this is what he was cooking up! Didn’t he look back for a few seconds before activating it? With this far ranged skill, why didn’t he activate it in the middle of the fight?’ Green Horn thought, and he had managed to come up with an answer.

’The lightning strikes must hurt his own people as well, so all I need to do is continue on with my plan!’ Greenhorn made up his mind. The distance between the two were quite far and the clouds didn’t reach the rest of where the others were fighting,

If the two of them were to run forward it was clear who would get to the others first.

Green Horn turned his head to look back at Owen, but soon his smile disappeared, as the other had disappeared without his knowledge.

A lightning strike, larger than the previous ones, appeared from the clouds, and suddenly right in front of the Green Horn was Owen himself.

"Breathe!" Owen said, as he took a deep breath and then extradited it out at the same time, he then threw out a blue fist filled with lightning hitting the Dalki in the stomach. Blood immediately came out from Green Horn’s mouth, and he attempted to hit Owen once again, but lightning striking from above had hit Green Horn paralysing him in place.

Owen took another breath, lifting his leg up high, and throwing a kick to the top of the Dalki’s head, leaving a trail of lightning behind.

The Dalki’s body was nearly lifted off its feet, but Green Horn had remained on the ground. Still, Owen wasn’t done yet, taking more breaths, each time he would continue to hit the Dalki, with his body covered in lightning.

To the c.h.e.s.t, a kick to the legs, then kicking the Dalki’s chin, he spun up in the air, and as soon as his two feet landed, he threw both of his fists, hitting the Dalki in the stomach. In the middle of their fight, the Dalki as its power was rising, was hoping to ignore the pain and strikes it was receiving to attack back, but he was contently being hit by the lighting from above.

’Damn it, I’m losing control over my breath! I can do twenty strikes at most with my lightning powers, and he has already endured sixteen. Just how durable is this damn Dalki!’ Owen cursed internally, but made sure to keep on a brave face.

Hoping to recover some energy, Owen moved into the clouds with his soul weapon. Allowing him to move as a lighting bolt itself, and then reappear away from the two of them as he tried to recover some of his breath.

However, what happened next had come as a complete surprise. The Dalki started to run in the opposite direction. It was running away from where his companions were battling and out of the clouds. As soon as Green Horn was in the clear, he spurted his wings from his back and flew up high in the sky.

’Did he just retreat, in the middle of the fight?’

Not quite sure what was going on, Owen had to make a decision. Since the Dalki had run away it should mean it was quite possible on its last legs. Could he really afford to let it go? On the other hand, how much could he do with his soul weapon nearly exhausted?

Besides, what about his own people that were still fighting the Dalki before him? Falling from the sky, Owen’s fan fell into his hand, and soon the clouds started to disappear. There was no sign of Green Horn anywhere and it looked like he had successfully fled. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Immediately, Owen seeing this, using the last bit of his strength, turned around and decided to help out his companions. He was strategic in the way he had helped them, due to already using much of his power during the fight, but there were situations where Owen had no choice but to jump in and fight. He even slipped up, getting hit in the legs and he could feel the bone in his t.h.i.g.h break.

Pushing through, he continued to fight, and his people started to keep an eye on him more. To them he was invincible, but it was the first time they had seen Owen pushed to this point, No longer calm and collected, and breathing heavily as he attacked Dalki after Dalki, but eventually large sh.i.p.s seemed to appear, and from them, Oscar and others came out.

With the help of Oscar, Owen was able to ease up and the battle was over.

The invading force of the Dalki were no more, but it didn’t come with ease, as the loss on the Graylash side was quite significant. Owen was surrounded by a group of his people, who had formed a circle around him, letting him use his powers without worrying about more Dalki attacking him, and he was so drained he had fallen to his knees.

At that moment, his people who had been protecting him turned, and looked at Owen. They all rushed to help him up, but one person had gotten there before the rest, faster than the others, and stood in front of Owen.

"Too easy" He said, as his red filled hand of aura went straight for Owen’s heart. He could see the attack coming his way, and with what little strength he had he had hit the hand slightly, but it wasn’t enough, he was too weak.

The attack had pierced right through Owen, and the last thing he could see was the smile on the person’s face, and his red eyes.
