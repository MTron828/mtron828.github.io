Chapter 2521 ¬†Red space to Golden Space

The fist of Immortui had gone right through Quinn's chest, and the blood crystal was now in his hand. Just from touching the outside, Immortui could feel the energy from within. His hands were slightly shaking.

'This power, it's power that has been cultivated for an incredibly long time. You must have been through a lot to have gotten so strong in such a short amount of time. It is a shame that your journey ended here.'

When Immortui's arm was pulled out, the lifeless body of Quinn fell to the floor. Blood was dripping from the hole in his chest, soaking the ground beneath it, and his eyes showed no sign of life.

As a god closely connected between life and death, he knew for sure that Quinn had perished, and he was no longer something to worry about. However, having followed the race of vampires, a creation that he had made, he did know one thing.

Original vampires, the first creations of Immortui, when they were to perish, their bodies usually turned into ash. Yet, even though a few moments had passed, Quinn's body still hadn't done so.

The armour that was on Quinn's body, Immortui could sense that it was powerful, and even though it was mostly destroyed with shards and more practically embedded into Quinn's body, it still had a sense of power.

But what could armour do if the person who was wearing it was dead? It was useless, and Immortui was far more focused on the goal he had been waiting for a long time.

'The connection of the crystal is strong with the golden space, and the power of the crystal is something that is similar to my own. A blood stone is a complicated object; it's not just a simple stone that stores the vampire's powers; it has more than just that,' Immortui thought as he started to gather the red mist around the crystal.

He slowly started to pull his hands, and the red mist connected with the crystal. It was vibrating in place as Immortui pulled his hands further and further. More of the red mist started to gather, and the crystal was beginning to light up.

Just a little ahead of where the crystal was, the red mist was forming a relatively large circle, and inside that circle, patterns, shapes, along with strange writing, were forming.

It looked similar to the magic circles that Agent 4 was able to draw up.

'In your last moments before death, you would have had a strong emotion, a thought in your mind of a particular place! Those strong emotions would have spread through your body and even kept in the Blood stone. Wherever this blood stone opens will be the place that you thought of in that moment.

'I guess the one saving grace is that you won't see the ones you care about the most die in front of your eyes.'

Immortui moved his hands away, and the crystal was being held up by his strange red power as it started to glow further. A beam came out from the crystal and hit the magic circle mist formation.

The moment it connected, the mist started to glow bright red as well, and all merged into one large image. Finally, the energy from the blood stone was being used, and it was breaking through, creating a portal from one world into the next.

Moments later, from above, a small object was seen getting larger by the second. It then crash-landed by Immortui's side and shook the ground beneath them.

"Oh‚Ä¶ so it looks like you finally achieved it, we are finally moving forward," Unzoku said. "I got your message, but I thought it might have been a trap."

The Demon King Unzoku had stopped his fight, as a message had been delivered to him, and not just him, but the rest of the demons as well.

"The portal, it isn't strong enough for us to go through just yet. If we try now, our bodies will just get rejected, but as for the other demons, they will be able to make it," Immortui explained.

"Don't worry; the fleets are already on their way. I will let my army of werewolves head in first," Unzoku replied and started to look around the place. He could see the dead body that was on the ground, but he was wondering about something else.

"Where are the other Demon Kings, where is Luce and Bisha?" Unzoku asked.

"You're not going to ask about Tenbris?" Immortui said, giving Unzoku the side-eye. It was as if he already knew what had happened. "All of them are dead. You and I are the only two left, but it's all we need to take charge and get rid of the celestials. We accomplish this, and you can have and do whatever you wish."

Unzoku seemed unfazed by it all, and in the distance, they could see the large fleet of ships moving their way. The Divine Brigade were still annoyingly fighting with their forces, but Immortui didn't care. In his mind, the war had just started sooner than he thought. When they went to the golden space, it would be a free-for-all, as he knew the Divine Beings targeted anything on sight.

"That body‚Ä¶ it still has power left in it," Unzoku said. "Do you mind if I eat it?"

Although the blood stone was no longer with Quinn, there was still a strong energy left in the cells of his body. Unzoku was already imagining just what stage he would get at. Would eating this body on the ground be the same as if he was to eat that werewolf from before?

"Sure, go ahead," Immortui stated, as he waited patiently for the other demons to arrive and the portal to open. He had been waiting so long for this moment, and now it was just a little longer.

Unzoku came close to Quinn's body, and when he went to snatch it with his hand, a blonde-haired figure appeared right in front of them.

Immediately, it was covered in large blue lightning all over his body.

"Don't touch him!" Sil shouted at the top of his lungs.

Lightning struck from his body constantly, rapidly firing out and hitting Unzoku. It sent a weird tingling sensation through his body. It didn't do much damage but had frozen him in place.

"You again, how are you still alive!" Immortui shouted as he saw who it was.

Sil immediately grabbed Quinn's body, and as quickly as he had arrived, he had disappeared.

"Damn it! Damn it!" Unzoku screamed, and the ground beneath his feet started to crack. He had recently gained a large increase in strength and he was still feeling a high of that power gain. He wanted more, and desperately.

"Don't worry about them; he was already dead, and the others should be close to it anyway," Immortui calmed Unzoku. "We have to focus on bigger enemies."
