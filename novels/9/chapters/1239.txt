Chapter 1240 Winning the battle, but losing the war

ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

For the viewers watching through the livestream, when they had seen Hilston Blade defeated, they had been sure that this was the end. Someone of such great power they had never known even existed a couple hours ago, they had lost him as quickly as they had found out about him.

He had powers that surpassed the former Big Four and he had been able to use their powers one after another to a stronger degree. If even someone like him could not defeat the five Spike, then the world couldn't imagine who else could. Their anger and frustration had been directed towards the one that had caused his death, who was none other than Sil, another Blade that belonged to the Cursed faction.

Soon, they thought that his death and the rest of their deaths would quickly come after, something most felt deserving for having gotten involved. They also looked to be losing out against the five Spike, but all of that changed with the arrival of the Cursed faction leader.

"Why is the reporter getting so excited to see Quinn arrive? Does she really think that he is going to be able to do anything?"

"I don't know and I don't care. There goes my diet, since we're all going to die anyway, might as well enjoy the rest of my life eating everything I have avoided so far."

"Weren't there rumours about them having a fling? Of course, she needs to hype up her boyfriend."

"But isn't he the one who defeated all those Dalki back then? Maybe he can do something again. I don't want to die. The Dalki has to be nearly dead! They just have to give it one more push!"

Most of them didn't believe one person could change anything, yet the flow of the entire fight had changed.

‚Äî‚Äî

Bonny had instructed Void to make sure to capture the intense look off Quinn's eyes as they glowed red, and the cameraman also managed to show off the point when the Cursed faction leader's soul weapon was activated. Shadows had risen all around everywhere, and using the strange sword, the Vampire Lord had managed to block the tail attack.

In the end, although Sil and the others were the ones that had finished off the Dalki with the last attack, it was clear as day to everyone that none of it could have been achieved without the last one to arrive.

‚Äî‚Äî

People were jumping for joy around all the different planets as they saw humanity defeat the great Dalki. A five spiked Dalki had never been seen before, apart from One Horn, so they were sure they had delivered a huge blow to their forces.

‚Äî‚Äî

"Quinn, you and your group, you actually managed to defeat a five spike. You really will become our hope." Sach thought.

Samantha, who was by his side, was shaking instead. When they had gone against One Horn, they hadn't even been able to draw out his full strength, judging by the video they had just watched.

'How‚Ä¶ how am I meant to defeat someone like One Horn if this is how strong they can get?' She thought. Worst yet, how was anyone able to defeat a five spike now. Did they have to rely on the Cursed faction? Even within the Dalki, one spike's strength could differ by quite a bit, so she wondered if it was the same for the five spikes.

There was no telling what would happen if they were to meet another one, and this time there would be no Hilston Blade to weaken it first.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Haha, Quinn you did it! Did you see that everyone? He used my blade to do it!" Longblade cheered for joy as he watched the fight with his subordinates. "That means that I played a major part in taking that thing down. It was because of me that he was able to defeat the Dalki!"

"Yes sir, it was smart of you to give him that blade, knowing he would be able to use it ahead of time." Avion complimented his superior, clearly knowing that that hadn't been Longblade's intention at all. Still it couldn't hurt to entertain him.

"I hope we get to meet them again." Rafer added.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Back on the Cursed planet themselves, they were more joyous than before, those that were on the fence about Quinn, since he had revealed he was a V had almost forgotten all about that. They were proud to have a leader like that and such a strong team.

'Quinn, thank God you survived. I guess I need to do my part as well to enjoy that future.' Helen mused.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Of course, even the Dalki had received the news, and Graham who had been paying attention to the whole thing in particular, seemed to be enraged.

"Damn it, to think we would lose Slicer this early on!" Graham cursed, and swung his arm, smashing the glass container by his side. The liquid flowed out onto the floor and the Dalki body with it. Soon, Graham was seen making a call to a certain someone. When the call was answered, Graham didn't hold back.

"I thought the idea of teaming up with that vampire was that the other vampires wouldn't get involved! That damn Cursed faction leader is a vampire, isn't he? So why did he act against us?!" Graham demanded to know an answer.

"Graham, I would suggest you take a deep breath. Anger doesn't suit you. Our plan is proceeding even better than we had estimated, despite things that we didn't foresee. In the first place, that boy has always been a special case. I just never expected him to cause this many problems for us in such a short time. Tell me your honest opinion, do you regard him as a problem you need my help with? Or is he someone you can deal with on your own?" The person asked.

Seeing Quinn fight, and the others, Graham, was trying to put himself in the same place as Slicer.

"I don't need your help, not that you alone would be much of a help anyway." Graham grumbled. "However‚Ä¶ I will have to adjust my plans without Slicer. Don't you complain about me taking a more 'liberal' approach from now on."

Graham ended the call there, going through the footage once more, in hopes to spot whatever he could. He rewinded the video a few times, and played it forward watching it again and again.

'I'm sure of it. One of those that were watching the fight on the sand dune and the Dalki that got involved in the fight, that four spike are the same person. They look almost human-like when they are on the Sand Dune. Yet, when fighting and showing the spiked the Dalki features appear more so. Something is going on. Perhaps I have found myself a new research subject. Maybe I can make him replace Slicer?'

'But first, I really need to calm myself down a little...'

Graham walked to the Dalki body on the floor, still thinking that perhaps the Dalki and Quinn were linked in some way, and lifted it off the ground.

"You might have won this battle, but I promise you I will make you pay the price for it." Graham spoke, before crushing the lifeless Dalki's head.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Deactivating his soul weapon, the after effects of using it were now being shown, making him lose some of his MC points. They were currently at 1100. He hadn't used it for long, so the points lost weren't too major. The others were now running towards Quinn to see if he was okay, while Sil was picking up his arm as well.

When they walked past Hilston, some of them decided to side step or take the long way around his body, and it was the same for Slicer's corpse as well.

"Quinn, are you alright? It's you inside your body, right?" Fex asked his best friend to make sure.

"Yeah, it's me." Quinn answered, not fully knowing what had happened while he had been away. More so, the Cursed faction leader was interested in something else. Since he wasn't in his body when he had met Slicer, Quinn was unaware that he had received a Quest.

However, he wasn't the one that killed Slicer, so he didn't seem to get any exp, and since the Blades weren't a part of his Cursed faction family the exp from the kill wasn't shared either. Nevertheless, he did come out with a reward.

'After all that trouble, I had to have gotten something.' Quinn thought. Before looking at it, the Vampire Lord was reflecting on the fight. He was wondering if they would have been able to defeat the other five spikes that he had met.

Hilston had done a lot of damage to the Dalki beforehand. Although the Dalki was stronger due to the damage, some of the injuries Hilston had done to the Dalki were beyond regular healing. On top of that, the female Dalki had displayed great vitality to the point she had been able to regenerate an even strengthened tail. Still, he estimated that the majority of the damage had been Hilston's achievements, with the next highest amount being Slicer's choice of hurting herself.

The main problem when facing the five Spike, was how tough its skin was, and how hard it was to even do a little bit of damage. Hilston with his demon tier armour's active skill had time to charge up a strong enough attack, but Quinn was unable to do the same, even with his Shadow overload skill since it didn't really increase his attack power.

He had the speed and he might have had the defence, but he lacked the power to go against his enemies like Hilston. Which was why Quinn hadn't insisted on being the one to deal out the last blow, leaving that to Sil.

'If it was a fight from the beginning, we all would have died even with my soul weapon, and we know the Dalki have at least two other five spikes. Worst of all, that weird Dalki is creating a method to evolve the spikes on their backs.' It was bad news, and unless Quinn could reach the next stage, he saw no way of them winning the war.

Checking his rewards, Quinn was hoping for something good, now he needed the system to deliver more than ever, but what he didn't realise, was as soon as Slicer had been defeated, the fighting had resumed with even more frenzy on the Dalki side.
