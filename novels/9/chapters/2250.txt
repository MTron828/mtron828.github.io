The strange white energy glow that had been surrounding Sera's body was no more, but his eyes were now filled with this energy, as were the weapons all along the ground.

When he walked towards the others, Chris could feel what he meant by his words from before. That this person had no fear, no fear of dying.Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

"What gives him this strength? Is it because he believes he is much stronger than us? Or is it something else?" Chris thought.

"Are we just going to stand here all day and play with ourselves, or are we going to fight?" Peter shouted, as he used the back of his heel to dig into Chris' side.

It was true, they had to fight either way, but there was no harm in being cautious. With Peter on his back, the two of them entered the field of weapons. They ran past several, and Chris began to circle their opponent.

The speed was fast enough to kick up dirt particles from the ground, and if someone was watching from the outside, it would look like a tornado was surrounding Sera.

Just like before, when the opportunity felt right, Chris pounced in, and Peter swung his head tail. Sera reached out to his right and grabbed one of the weapons on the ground, and it was just a simple staff.

It didn't look impressive and could even be confused as just a stick. Moving to the side, Sera had dodged the sharp end of the head tail and swung down the simple stick, pinning the head tail right to the ground.

A burst of white energy filled the bottom of the stick. Then, bending slightly again in a small movement, Sera picked up a sword. He could see Chris attempting to attack him by using his mouth and opening it up with his razor-sharp teeth.

With another swift movement and perfect timing, he moved to the side and slashed, hitting the back leg of Chris. It was a deep cut that caused Chris to crash his head into the ground and tumble. Peter had fallen off but managed to get up just in time.

When the two looked at their opponent again, this time they could see a bow and arrow in his hands. Letting go, a stream of energy followed behind it. It was sharp and fast.

"I can only attack it!" Chris gritted his teeth, transforming back to his werewolf form and swinging his fists. Before it reached though, the arrow had split into several smaller beams of energy and moved around it.

Two of the arrows went right through the arm of Chris and the shoulder. They were big blows, creating small holes in the werewolf's flesh. His healing abilities were working overtime.

Meanwhile, the rest of the arrows had headed towards Peter. Curling up into a ball, he had managed to protect himself again. The arrows pierced through his arms as well, aiming for his head, but they didn't get through.

When the arrows tried to pierce further, his own internal energy was fighting back against the arrows, essentially disintegrating them before they could do any more damage.

"What is going on?" Peter shouted, uncurling himself. He felt embarrassed that he had to protect himself in such a way, and he didn't understand what was happening.

There didn't seem to be much change in Sera, only that he no longer had the weapons on his body, and shouldn't that be worse for him in the first place? The truth was, Sera had more powers than the others had imagined.

Right now, he had created a battlefield for himself, at least what represented a battlefield, with the fallen weapons on the ground. In truth, it was a battlefield. Even in the zone where the weapons were, there were fallen enemies and friends, and battles were continuing all over the place.

All of this was giving energy to Sera, giving him celestial energy. In turn, he could use that energy to create a zone where his weapons would all have the same effect as if they were on him.

They were all at the demon tier level, and all of them were powering him. At the same time, while in the battlefield zone that he had created, he would get an additional boost.

Before, too slow to react to the speed, he was now enhanced and making minimal movements, and combining all the uses of his weapons, his fighting was coming out.

The two attempted to do the same again, Chris turning into his wolf form and Peter getting on top of him, but in the middle of it, a spear had been picked up and was thrown right through the air.

"Do you think I would let you do something so annoying again?" Sera said.

He now had small objects in his hand that had razor-sharp edges. It looked similar to what was attached to his armour before, only these were thinner and lighter.

Throwing them out in the air, they started to go off in all sorts of different directions, and now Sera ran towards the two, being on the attack. On the way, he picked up two curved weapons and held them in his hand.

Peter, seeing this, had gathered energy in his fist and threw it out. A yellow ball of energy was going towards Sera, but rather than strike the energy or move out of the way, with his foot, Sera kicked up a large axe from the floor.

Midair, the weapon collided with the energy. Keeping both in place, the axe spun on the floor and eventually lost out in the struggle of power, but the attack had been blocked and allowed for Sera to now be above them both.

Sera swung his sword down, hitting both claws of the wolf that had now transformed back into a werewolf. The energy created from the strike had pushed Chris deeper into the ground.

Peter went to attack with his head tail, and throwing towards one of the swords with the head tail, he was able to deflect it. Then a secondary head tail came. Once again, in a desperate move to harm Sera, a second head tail had come out.

With his other sword, though, Sera just left it in place, hovering with his energy, and moved to the side. The head tail collided with his second sword, and now there was nothing in Sera's hands, but he was by Peter's side.

"You said that I should be using my hands for combat, right? Then tell me how this feels!" Sera threw a fist, and it landed cleanly right on Peter's nose. A cracking noise could be heard, and the bones themselves could be felt breaking, including those in Peter's skull.

Luckily for him, his healing capabilities were kicking in as well, as he was sent away and off into the distance.

Turning back around, Sera was ready to deal with the other one, but when looking at where he had last seen Chris, he noticed that he wasn't there, and only the imprint of his body on the ground was.

Soon, though, Sera could feel a rise in energy. It wasn't a power like he was used to. It wasn't celestial energy.

"Just what is going on?" Sera thought. That was when his eyes locked onto the energy.

"I thought that there might be more trouble that we would have to deal with," Chris said. "The fact that you are here, I thought it meant that there would be others as well.

"I still don't understand why you are helping these aliens, but when my life is on the line, I don't have the time to be answering questions."

A short burst of energy, a last-ditch effort. Chris had activated the fourth stage of Qi, using the Pure's invention of a soul weapon, and while doing this, he had completely transformed into his werewolf state.

Both of these things combined made Chris the Crimson Red Werewolf.
