Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Although Russ had somewhat explained his abilities, Quinn still didn't completely understand how it worked, and everytime he saw it he was quite amazed. The people around had seen a human figure change into one of their own race.

Those that were just glancing as they moved around the arcade were now pointing and talking about what had just taken place.

When looking at Russ and his opponent, although they looked the same, their body shape was slightly different, at first Quinn wondered why, but he soon got the answers from listening in on those around him.

"Hey, doesn't that strange alien Penswi have the perfect body shape?"

"What, you mean the fake Penswi, well now that you say it, his body shape is almost exaclty like Stark."

"Just because he has the body shape of the fastest Penswi on the planet, doesn't mean he is just as fast."

The easiest thing for Russ to do, was to use his power to imitate his opponent, but he had no experience with the Penswi body, and most likely if the two of them were to go face to face with the same type of body with the same level of ability, he would lose and at best draw.

Although Russ had suffered quite a few losses here and there recently, he hated to lose. So while searching in the young Penswi's mind, he came across the strongest image in his head, and that was who he was right now.

Seeing this, Quinn thought that his initial plan to help Russ, so he could grow stronger, was the right thing to do after all.

"What is this?" Zallack called out, walking to the middle of where the two platforms were and pointing at Russ's body.

"Are you trying to get away with cheating? This is nothing like what you looked like before, your whole body is completely different." Zallack complained.

"Cheating?" Russ said, as he looked back. Although his body was that of a Penswi, his face was still recognizable of his own. It looked like he was unable to completely change into another person, even if using their powers.

Otherwise that would be quite frightening, Quinn thought, and would be a stronger power.

"This is my power, this is simply something that I am able to do." Russ answered. "Think about it. You Penswi use your natural ability, your natural powers of speed to win at these games, correct?

"Then, I am just doing the same. I am using my natural powers to adjust myself in a more favourable position. You stated the rules clearly in the beginning and this wasn't in your rules."

Russ turned back around, as if he wasn't even going to listen to Zallack if he tried to refute it, and since it seemed like no one was backing up Zallack, he decided to step back. That was because most that were watching, were more interested in what this copycat type person could do.

"3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶start!"

Unlike the last time, the Penswi was not going to get distracted by looking at his opponent, and decided to hit the buttons as fast as he could. With his long limbs, it allowed him to reach the buttons that appeared high up, as well as far to the right and left without having to move.

The Penswi weren't just fast in their legs, but their eyes, heads, arms‚Ä¶ their whole bodies were able to move fast. Right now, if there was a Penswi that was watching him, he felt like he might get recruited for a national team he was doing so well.

The problem was, although he was impressive, no one was looking at him, because by his side, there was someone far more impressive.

Russ was off to a bit of a rough start, but due to seeing the match before him, he had paid close attention to how the Penswi worked, but imagining and doing were two different things. When the game started, he was around 20 or points behind his opponent, but eventually everyone could see that number drawing closer and closer, and it wasn't because Russ's opponent was slowing down, it was because he was speeding up.

"My word‚Ä¶ it really is‚Ä¶ it is like watching Stark." One of the onlookers commented.

Buttons were appearing and being tapped, one after the other, the speed of the arms moving were nearly twice as fast and the minute had eventually come to an end.

"554 points, thats a new record!" The young Penswi smiled.

When turning his head to look at the scoreboard, the smile quickly disappeared.

"823 points‚Ä¶. I lost by so much."

It was meant to be a proud moment for the Penswi, achieving a personal record, but in this situation where his friends were watching and losing by such a difference, he was unable to enjoy this moment as he went back.

"Are there any recruits watching, that guy could be on a professional team."

"Did you forget something? He is not a Penswi."Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

The transformation was ending, and Russ was reverting back to his normal self. It was the first time for a lot of them there, witnessing a Penswi losing to another race, but they didn't feel too annoyed. Because the opponent had done so after changing his body into something similar to theirs.

"Alrighty." Russ said, hitting Quinn on the shoulder. "If you win, then we have our guides, I have done everything I can."

It was a game that Quinn didn't really want to particpate in anyway, but since it had come to this, and the only thing he needed to do was win, he thought he might as well give it a try.

Walking over, Quinn stood on the platform, and this time, the one that had been running his mouth, the leader of the group, Zallack, was his opponent, when he stood on the other platform he looked at Quinn for a few moments.

"Aren't you going to change, like the person before you did?" Zallack asked.

"That's not something I really do." Quinn replied, not wanting to explain himself, it would be a long and hard thing to try to do in the first place.

A lot of the onlookers were expecting another transformation but when they realised that it wasn't going to take place, quite a few of them started to walk off in disappointment.

"Zallack has this one in the bag, right!" One of his friends said.

"Of course he does, he's the best of all of us, and as long as that alien doesn't transform into one of us again, how can Zallack lose?"

Looking at the scoreboard, the new highscore was Russ's score with 823 points, but before that, Zallack held the record with around 700. He was skilled at not just this game but many, because he was a trainee for the one of the top professional teams of the Penswi.

'Why am I so nervous, even when I go up against professionals in the camp, I'm not this nervous. Is it just because he grabbed my hand from before? That was just a coincidence‚Ä¶ I just didn't notice him, calm down.'

"3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1..Start!"

The game had begun and Quinn was relatively calm. He had played multiple different games that would be used for training, such as the Block Block game, and he always was quite good at them.

Judging by his speed as well, he felt he would be good at this one as well.

'Let's try match his speed for now.' Quinn thought.

The numbers were going up, and looking like they were going up neck and neck. There was one or two points difference between the two.

'I saw the look on the Penswi's face before, these guys are just kids, trying to have fun. There is no need to humiliate them.' Quinn thought.

Once in a while Quinn would glance up at the scoreboard, and this didn't go unnoticed by the other Penswi, as soon as he did, Quinn would move at a faster speed to match the points up again.

"What is that alien doing?" One of them asked.

"Is he‚Ä¶ slowing down on purpose‚Ä¶ why does he keep looking at the scoreboard."

As the time was reaching close to the end, there was still around 1 or two points between the two, but at the very last moment as Quinn looked at the scoreboard a second before it ended, he moved as fast as he could, hitting a few of the buttons.

Zallack looked up, 760 points, a new personal record for himself, but when he turned his head, Quinn's scoreboard said 761.
