Chapter 982 - The strongest fighters in the world

Upon returning to the Cursed ship and hearing nothing terrible had happened at school while Quinn was away, he was in no rush to go back just yet. He had time to think about what Vincent had talked about.

One of the most critical things Quinn had to worry about was getting stronger for the future enemies ahead. One of the easiest ways was to improve something he was severely lacking, and one of those was his combat fighting skills.

He never worried about this much before but did try practising a little when he had no abilities.

’I remember those days, Quinn started to reminisce. ’I thought watching a few martial arts movies and copying them would make me some skilled master, and then I would just get blasted with a green energy blast. Yeah, no karate-chopping skills are going to stop that.’ Quinn thought.

However, things were different now. Quinn had a body that could put fighting skills to good use, just like the other leaders did.

Checking his system, Quinn could see the tutorial zone that displayed Vincent’s lessons in the system.

’Do you have any more of these?’ Quinn asked.

’I mean, I don’t, but honestly, I think you’re beyond anything that I could teach you through a video. At the moment, you have a body that would be good in any martial art. However, what you need is something that would actually be good in fighting against ability users. This I’m not the best at.’

Hearing these words while on the Cursed ship, Quinn went looking for Leo. Although he was a swordsman, he did know the martial art taught by the military quite well, and perhaps there was someone he could recommend.

While searching high and low around the ship, Quinn couldn’t find him anywhere and eventually ran into Sam, walking through one of the hallways.

"Quinn, you still haven’t returned. You know the students will miss you?" Sam said.

"It’s fine. They have a good teacher. I was actually looking for Leo. Have you seen him anywhere?" Quinn asked.

"Actually, Leo wanted to catch up with you about something, but it looks like one of the planets that Pure has members on is close by, so they have decided to go there. Don’t worry, they took Nate along as well, just in case there is any trouble."

There was no time frame for when Quinn needed to get things done, so there wasn’t an urgency in him, but at the same time, there was the constant worry that the Dalki, a vampire force or even Pure, could attack them at any point.

Although Quinn was happy they had taken a shadow user along like he asked, he felt a bit unlucky that they had taken Nate. If he couldn’t get an answer from Leo, he would have asked Nate, a great martial artist, what to do next.

’I guess I could just teleport there and then travel back, but they might be in the middle of something.’

"Go on. I can see you have something on your mind. What do you want?" Sam asked.

Quinn explained what he wished to do. How he wanted to improve his martial arts skills. Thinking about it for a while, Sam eventually gave an answer.

"Do you remember how the two of you first met through the Power fighters game? Well, there was a reason why Nate would constantly play it. Even for him, there were plenty of strong people there.

"You have to remember not everyone likes the limelight. Some people have strong abilities or are just strong that they choose to hide their powers when they join a faction. Before the civil war, although it was normal for others to fight and such, strong people didn’t often fight each other due to fear of how much destruction and death it would cause.

"Do you think the Graylash family ever fought against the Bree family, or the Sun Shields without people getting hurt?"

Hearing this, Quinn thought it would be quite interesting. He hadn’t played the game in a while. When he first started out, he used the game often to test out his blood abilities that could be used with no restrictions inside the game.

’I suppose if I play again, I can just not use my blood abilities. Before, I was obsessed with the exp, not that it would do anything for me now. But now I can just fight against ability users, just using my fists. If I lose, it won’t really be a problem.’

Quinn thought it was a great suggestion and thanked Sam before leaving off to play the game. There were quite a lot of pods on board the Cursed faction, as the game had always been popular with people, including the Cursed faction.

However, there was one person he thought he should meet before playing the game, asking if he could work out some personal request for Quinn, and that was none other than Logan.

He was inside his usual research room, a room that was given just to Logan dedicated to him to work on whatever he needed. It didn’t take long for Logan to turn it into his own personal room, as it was filled with what Quinn could only describe as useful junk all around the room.

He was careful to use the word ’Useful’ because often, things that looked strange and that he didn’t understand would be quite helpful. A lot of the stuff in the room was brought over from the many locations the Green family owned, the projects his family were working on before they had passed.

"Quinn, that’s you right? No one else has as light footsteps as you do. Also, I heard from Sam that you have just returned from the vampire world. Did he tell you about my request?" Logan said, as he was wearing some strange goggles and using his robotic arm, but soon the googles started to deform into the tiny spiders and created some shoulder pads instead.

"Request, I didn’t know you had one? I was actually coming to you to ask about something. What did you want to ask?" Quinn wondered.

Logan looked at Quinn for a few seconds and didn’t say anything.

"Logan, please, you already helped me a lot. Remember, even with the current situation, anything you need that I can help with, I will do it." Quinn said.

Then, as if Logan was waiting for Quinn to say these words, he gave a reply.

"Great, then I wish to go to the vampire world and go to the lab out in the mountains. I will take my leave tomorrow and make sure to take one of the shadow users with me. I will also take Borden along for protection, so you can’t complain. A leader wouldn’t go back on their word, right?"

For some reason, Quinn felt like he had just been tricked.

’This is what happens when you have people smarter than you helping you out.’ Quinn thought.

"What do you want to do there anyway?" Quinn asked.

"I plan to visit the lab so I can clone myself a new arm. The lab had the ability to create a clone of Vorden, that’s how I accidentally made Borden, so I should be able to create a hand for myself if I study the equipment myself." Logan replied as if it was no big deal.

"Wait! What happens if you make another, like a Logan Dalki? I know Borden turned out to be okay, but we can’t guarantee that another one will be, can we?" Quinn said worryingly.

"Don’t worry about that. There isn’t enough energy to create another Dalki. That was the problem in the first place and part of the reason why Borden is so unstable. Leave the thinking to me. If I tried to explain anything to you, then it would just be pointless. Fighting is your strong point. This is mine so leave that to me."

Although Quin didn’t like it, visiting the vampire world last time, it seemed like everything had calmed down quite a bit, and as long as someone like Linda who knew the shadow went along with them, then Quinn could be there if there was any trouble, as for Borden. He was as strong as a leader, so no one would mess with him. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Talking about fighting, there were a few things I wanted to ask you about..." Quinn discussed his plan and how he would like to join power fighters one more time, but he had some special requests.

"Sure, I can do that for you. As you know, the game ranks you based on your Traveller Rank. So you want me to put you as an A rank traveller, correct? That shouldn’t be a problem. As long as you keep winning fights, the system will naturally put you against the higher Travellers and then you will enter the ranking system."

"Ranking System?"

"Each time you win, you get Elo points, which will rank you up and down, putting you in the top hundred of the power fighters game. This is only available to Travellers Rank B and upwards. Win enough times in a row, and you will eventually get put in the top hundred."

It sounded like Sam’s suggestion was turning into a good idea, and there was even a goal to aim towards now.

"Wow, an online ranking, who’s at the top, is it someone I know?" Quinn wondered. Being in the position he was in now, surely the top would be filled with people he had seen or at least heard off.

"Not really, at least I don’t know who they are," Logan replied. "You have to remember a few things. Fighting in the game, although meant to simulate real combat, isn’t the same. There are differences. Also, one can not use their soul weapon in the game either. And sometimes soul weapons are a big differentiator when one is fighting in the real world." Logan explained.

It made sense, and now for some reason, Quinn was itching to go into the power fighters game. However, there were a couple more requests Quinn had made.

"And about my other request?" Quinn asked.

"That’s fine," Logan said. "I can put in a limiter just for you, so you will be limited to fifty percent of your body’s strength. You can increase this in the game as you wish. As for your other request, usually, only one person can be linked with one I.D., but It’s me after all, so I can do what I like. We will create a new I.D. for you."

The name Bloodevolver was too famous, and Quinn wasn’t going to be using the blood skills this time around. He was going to be testing his fighting skills, so he wanted a new I.D.

"Do you want me to come up with the name for you?" Logan asked.

"No, no, please!" Quinn quickly said. "It’s okay. I can pick my own." Quinn said, fearing he would be known as Buinn.
