Chapter 2499 Quinn's Duty

Hikel had informed Quinn of everything that had gone on so far. Including as to who had decided to come to this different world after Quinn, and how it was possible for them. The familiars even came out from Peter's side for a moment to show Quinn their welcome, all apart from the Boneclaw.

For what reason, unsure, maybe it was due to the past connection they had, and what had occurred the last time the two had met. An explanation was given for their actions. Ovinnik gave a quick run down as to what was going on in the Familiar world as well.

After learning from everyone, he was truly at a loss for words.

'These guys, more of them came over than I expected.' Quinn wanted to get angry at them. He wanted to tell them they were idiots, but then what would that make him?

How could he do such a thing to people who were willingly sacrificing their lives just to help him. If anything, he felt guilty, that he couldn't solve this problem before it got to this stage, and that he wasn't strong enough.

There were those that he did want to give an earful to and that was the champions who had kept the whole thing secret from him. They could have at least informed him that his friends were there and allowed him to be the one to make the decision. He could tell though, to them, the training he had gone through was very important, and having learned something from it, he wasn't going to be quick to judge them.

"Then where are they all now?" Quinn asked. "With everything that is going on right now, aren't they all in danger? It feels like there is a war going on outside, and I have a feeling that this is the celestials doing."

"The celestials?" Hikel replied.

"Yeah, for a while now, they have been worried about a war starting between the two, but they were confident in the fact that Immortui could never escape this place. So what if he builds up an army and becomes ruler of this world? It was a world that they had long abandoned."

These words struck the champions more so than they could believe. Many of them had given up on believing in things like gods due to the cruelty they saw the inhabitants had suffered.

"That was why a while ago I was sealed away, because I was a key, a power that they could use to link between the two worlds. I don't know if they knew about Jessica at the time, or what‚Ä¶ but I think they were more afraid of me.

"I can only imagine that they have started this attack, because they have learned that I'm in this space. They are worried that Immortui will go to the other side. Using whatever these things are, they can get rid of him before he builds a bigger army, or at least weaken him before his attack."

A loud bang was heard and Shinto's hand could be seen on the side of the cave wall. He was so frustrated by the whole situation he had to let out his anger in some way.

"But those things, they attacked us as well. I could feel it, couldn't you guys feel it as well?" Shinto asked. "They had no mind of their own, they only had one goal, one target and that was to kill whatever is in front of it. Which means that right now, probably all of the inhabitants, on all of the planets, are being killed and slaughtered."

The others didn't say anything because they knew he was right, and it was the same for Quinn. He could actually feel the constant death and the blood being spilt all over going on.

"As I said, this could become a very dangerous situation very quickly, so where are the others? We need to help them, or get them out of whatever situation they are in." Quinn asked.

Again there was a moment of silence and the one to speak up was Russ.

"You guys just tell the guy already!" Russ said. "Chris and Edvard, they were out there fighting along with us, they met up with one of the demon kings while we did as well and we split up.

"But do you really think that werewolf guy, is going to die from that, not a chance. I saw how desperate he was in that pit." Russ claimed. "As for Sil, he's the one that you should be worrying about."

It was then that Peter decided to speak up, as he walked in front.

"Sil‚Ä¶ he decided to face Immortui." Peter explained. "While you were asleep, Immortui was tracking us down after rescuing you from him. He had created clones as a diversion, but then Immortui was tracking them down, taking them out quickly, so he decided to buy time for us to get the demon king blood, and for you to wake up."

Grinding his teeth, Quinn nearly immediately left the cave until Hikel stood in his way.

"This is why we were cautious of telling you Quinn. We still don't have all of the demon kings' blood that you need!" Hikel said, as he pulled out the flask from his trousers and handed it over. Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

"If you head out there, do you think you can find where Sil is? It's impossible, with his powers, they could be anywhere."

"But he's fighting Immortui because of me!" Quinn shouted back. "If I hadn't been in that state, then Sil wouldn't be risking his life."

"Do you think he's that weak?" Peter asked. "You and I both have known SIl for a very long time. We have known him since the start. He has gotten through a lot, and even though a 1000 years passed, he was still able to survive."

There were the others to think about as well. Chris and Edvard could be out there going up against a demon king. What if they weren't capable of taking it out, or had done it and were running from the Divine beings that were littered throughout the planet.

"Peter, I know what you're saying." Quinn said. "And you're right, but I can't lose any more of you. I've lost too much on this entire journey. Like you said, we have been there with each other from the beginning. Ever since the academy, even when things were hard, Sil would take over Vorden's body and help us.

"He even helped us escape from Blade island, and has saved us more times than I can count. I can't just do nothing. I have to try help him somehow."

"Then drink the blood." Hikel said. "We managed to get the blood of one of the demon kings in that flask. You do what you need to do, and we will go support Chris and Edvard out there."

"We will go as well." Pultra said. "I think this is a chance. This war that's going on has distracted them. This might be our only chance to get rid of all of the demon kings and Immortui."

Opening up the flask, Quinn gulped it down, and he could immediately feel something changing in his body. A tingling sensation that was going on throughout. The blood that was being split on the other planets, he could feel it as well, his senses were growing.

[Quest update]

[Blood of the Demon King Luce has been consumed]

[2 of 5 Demon King's blood has now been consumed]

[A higher level blood has been detected, an update to a quest has been secured]

[4 / 5 Demon General's blood has been consumed]

This had come to a surprise to Quinn but it had made sense to him as well. If he consumed the demon king's blood, then why would he need to consume a lesser blood such as that of the general.

Now it had confirmed his suspicions, that he could just go for the demon kings, but if he just got one more blood type, then his blood aura should get an upgrade.

The last blood type that Quinn needed to get was that of the werewolf demons, either from Unzoku, or his generals, since he was in need for the blood of the demon king as well anyway.

"I'll be at the place where we were training at." Quinn said, looking at Pultra. "If you manage to get more of the demon kings' blood, especially of the werewolf race you talked about, then come to me. It will help in our situation.

"Everyone, I've said this before, but stay alive, I don't plan on saying goodbye to any of you." Quinn said, as he left the cave.

'If I can't find Immortui and Sil, then I will just have to find a way, to bring him to me.'
