Immortui had disappeared from controlling the old man, but it left Quinn with a lot to think about. He allowed for Muka and her family to clear the area, make a story up for the public to believe for now.

It was a hard thing to decide, did they make the settlement aware of what was happening, or would doing so cause more panic. For now, Quinn decided against letting everyone know.

'How do I even go forward from this situation?' Quinn thought to himself. 'Every person who gets marked, they not only can affect those around them, but at the same time, they can just kill themselves at the end of the day, losing one more life in this settlement.'

There was also one more thing, the last words of the old man, all of this was a distraction, did it mean he had a bigger target than Ronkin, or just someone bigger in general.

"Muka!" Quinn called out and she appeared by his side in an instant. "I know you're busy and spread thin, so I want you to get some help from Edvard and Hikel. Get a list of all of those that took part in the war.

"Currently, every single one of them is a suspect."

Quinn had to make this decision, they were all the most likely to have come close to death on the battlefield, giving Immortui a chance to mark them.

"Once you find out who they are, then see where they currently are, and cross reference them with a list of those closest to me. Get the leaders to attempt to protect them, I will be going over every single one that's close to me."

The order was heard loud and clear.

The lessons in the classroom continued, and there was a strange atmosphere due to all of the guards. None of the kids were aware of what was happening, and they had tried their best to focus on their lessons, but other than the vampires standing in the back, there was also something incredibly strange with the teacher.

"Is it just me, or does Miss Bedford look uncomfortable in that skirt she's wearing, it's almost as if she's forgotten how to walk?" Toni whispered.

"Her explanations are really hard to understand as well, it seems like today she's just reading straight from the book." Abby commented.

All of the kids including Minny felt this way.

Eventually, lunch time had arrived, and even when they were outside in the playground, all of the guards from all of the classrooms had come out, watching their every move. There were 3 classes per grade and 5 grades in total. Each of the classes had at least two guards in their classroom.

So they were being protected by thirty or so vampires. It seemed a bit much honestly, especially since the settlement was no longer meant to have enemies.

When going back to their classes, the awkward lessons continued, as Miss Bedford continued to read from the textbooks.

Hikel and Edvard were doing as ordered, and they were going through all of those who had taken part in the war. It didn't take long as they had systems for everything, and Vincent, using his machines, was able to cross reference everything.

The two of them had yet to act, and were in Vincent's lab as they looked at all of the information.

"Alright, so these are all of those that fought in the war, and now what I'll do is create a map, so we can see all of their known locations. Of course this won't be entirely accurate. I can only put a pin on where their post is meant to be at this point and time, but it is possible they wouldn't be there." Vincent explained.

If a person was a guard, it would be harder to pinpoint them since they would cover a certain area and would move within that area. If they owned a stall then a small dot would appear there if it was their working hours, but of course they could have left the stall and the system would be unable to account for that.

The screen popped up, and several marks could be seen all over the place. There were multiple dots, over a 1000 of them, since so many vampires had taken part in the war. With all of these being potential markings they knew it was going to be a mammoth of a task.

"Wait, right there!" Edvard pointed. "Look, it seems like there is a concentrated amount, at one specific location, don't you think that's a little suspicious. If they were at the castle or something it would make sense but that's away from the castles."

Vincent zoomed in, trying to figure out what that place was.

"It's Roland Academy."

Vincent quickly brought up a file.

"It says that an order was sent out by Muka, to assign guards to the school, but that order went through a vampire named Barry Wheels. Another one who took part in the war. He assigned all of the vampires that are on guard duty and every single one of them took part in the war."

It wasn't so unusual, as most vampires capable of fighting would have taken part in the war anyway. So it seemed like it might just be a coincidence, but all of them had the same thought in their head, it was best they inform Quinn of this, and check out that place first because his daughter was there.

‚Äî‚Äî

In all of the other classrooms, something strange had happened at the exact same time. The guards for the most part just stood at the back, not saying a word and not moving during the whole lesson, but in every single one of the classrooms, the guards started to move.

They said nothing to the teacher or to the students as they left through the back door, and went into the hallway. The teacher's thought nothing of it and thought that it was maybe just them being called on duty, and continued to look after the kids in their classroom.

That was because they were unaware that the same thing was happening everywhere else, and all of the guards were heading to one room in particular.

In Minny's class the lesson seemed somewhat uninteresting today, perhaps because of the teacher, so she started to day dream away as she usually would. In her head she was imagining winning a jackpot of juice boxes and drinking so much of them that she turned into a balloon and floated up to the sky.

The simple thought of this brought a large smile on her face. Her and everyone else though was unaware that on the two vampires at the back of the class, the vampire knights, the front of their hands, a marking started to glow.

Both of them at the same time started to move from their position, and walked through the space in between the students' desks. The kids wondered where they were going, but didn't say much.

Both of their eyes, locked on one target and one target only.

‚Äî‚Äî

Finding a vampire that could use the telepathic ability, the others had contacted Quinn straight away, informing him of what they had found out.

"I see, so you believe that Immortui is going after Minny again." Quinn replied. "Then, I wouldn't worry so much. I thought that this might happen and I prepared for it. If she's in school, then she's probably in one of the safest places possible."

The vampires had no idea what Quinn meant by this.

‚Äî‚Äî

Back in the classroom, the guards had gotten close to Minny, one of them went to reach with their hand out, when suddenly, a fist had landed right in the man's face. The bones cracked complete as his whole body was sent flying back and crashing into the wall.

The other vampire was too slow to react, as he had already been grabbed by the head and slammed into the ground.

"Whoaaa! What is happening!" Toby said, jumping out of his seat, because the floor was cracked beneath him. "Did‚Ä¶ did Miss Bedford just kill the two guards."

Miss Bedford had jumped from her position, attacking the two guards, before they could even get close to Minny. She then stood up by her desk and looked outside, seeing the others coming close.

"With me around, no one will lay a finger on her." She said, and on her face, the others could see it started to crumble. As if small pieces of mud were dropping down onto the floor.

When it finally fell, another face was in its place, and the body of the person started to change as well.

"Uncle Peter!" Minny called out.
