Chapter 874: Quinn vs six, fight or run?

Looking at all the leaders in front of Quinn was quite daunting. Especially considering he had just had a large fight with one of the leaders in a one on one fight, now there were six in front of him. Perhaps Bryce was considered the strongest out of the leaders, but each leader was strong and had their own fighting style.

The strength between each leader was different by leaps and bounds, so Quinn couldn’t see himself getting out of this through a fight, nor could he picture any of the other leaders either.

’But maybe he could?’ Quinn thought, comparing himself to a certain person.

While thinking about this, it seemed like the system had agreed with him as well. There was only one time the system had given him a quest similar to this one, and that was when Quinn was on the Blade family island. Back then, the system was very accurate, because there was no way of Quinn seeing himself winning the fight against the Blade twins, and it felt the same way now.

Still, the question remained on what he should actually do? Once captured, there was a low chance that he would ever be set free. He was practically just giving his life to them. Many of the leaders disliked him and would just see this as an excuse to get rid of him.

In terms of escaping, Quinn could use his shadow to transfer himself back to one of those at the castle and protect himself there, but based on the situation, he would have to face the power of all the other leaders attacking his castle. This would put the others through danger, and there was a low chance they would survive such an attack.

Finally, the words of Muka rung through his head.

If he was to fight back and resist, then what would happen to the tenth family? They would deem him an enemy of the vampire settlement. How far would that go? Would that also include everyone related to him, all members of the tenth family as well? Would they be punished for his actions?

In the middle of all his thoughts, a small near enough invisible object came towards him. Sensing it, Quinn managed to raise his shadow and block the object. Seeing it now stuck in his shadow he could see it was a red soaked needle.

"Suzan, what are you doing? He hasn’t decided to resist yet!" Jin shouted, as he knew straight away which leader the needle had come from.

"That needle wasn’t aiming to kill him, you know what my needles can do." She replied. "Also why are we bother taking him in, I think we know full well who killed Dwight. Would anyone else even think of doing such a thing, but an outsider like him. There’s no need for the rest of you to get involved." She said as she rushed in with a needle between each of her fingers.

Seeing this, Quinn wasn’t just going to let Suzan come at him and do nothing. He was tired of doing nothing.

Suzan was confident, based on what she had seen Quinn do in her last fight, and this was her downfall. When Suzan was within range and close enough so it was nearly impossible for her to avoid, Quinn used his skill Shadow Path. Once it touched her feet she immediately started to slow down.

The shadow path skill was hard to hit the further one was away, since the skill was slow to come out, but with someone as careless as her, he knew it would hit. Then Quinn aimed one of his fingers carefully, and fired out a blood bullet, hitting her right in the knee. She fell to the ground still in the shadow path. Out of anger on one knee, she threw out a desperate blood swipe, but Quinn simply avoided it with a flash step and threw one of his own towards her.

Suzan wanted to move, but her leg was badly hurt and for some reason, it wasn’t healing. Although he hadn’t restored all his Qi from the fight with Bryce, Quinn had healed it enough to at least use the first stage of Qi to disrupt their healing.

With the blood swipe coming towards her, and her leg hurt, she raised a blood barrier, but when the attack hit her barrier, it smashed right through and continued to move forward. The leaders who were casually watching were shocked and now knew the real danger Suzan was in.

This caused a movement between the leaders who were only watching at the moment. The seventh leader Kyle and the twelfth leader Prima were on the move. First, Prima had moved Suzan off from the shadow and off to the side, while Kyle took off the cape on his back, and at the right moment, had engulfed the blood swipe from Quinn.

’He blocked my attack, but that blood wipe was infused with Qi?’ Quinn thought.

’That cape is related to the seventh family’s ability, which is why your Qi has not disrupted the flow of energy, Quinn fighting six leaders at once with all their abilities....’ Vincent didn’t want to say anymore, for his words would only put pressure on Quinn even more.

"You sc.u.m, what are you trying to do?!" Prima shouted.

"Didn’t you all see!" Quinn shouted back. "first, you accuse me without even telling me what evidence you have against me, and then you attack me first. Do I not even have the right to defend myself!" Quinn asked.

Although Quinn was unaware, the vampire leaders were now a little on edge, due to what had just happened. The weak leader they knew from before, was able to hurt Suzan badly, and it looked like Quinn had done everything so casually.

What was worrying them most, was the fact that despite there being six leaders in front of him, Quinn wasn’t scared.

’Quinn, you were only on earth for a short time. What happened to you?’ Jin thought, remembering their first fight.

’Quinn, I don’t know what you plan to do, but if the message was really sent out to all the leaders, the others will be here soon, if you have decided to fight, then you have to beat all of these and get out of here!.’ Vincent urged.

But it looked like the others were deciding for him, as both David the 11th leader, Prima and Kyle charged forward at once, each with their clawed hands covered in the blood arnameant.

’Well, they’ve already made a choice. They won’t even give me a chance to explain myself, and I can’t let the others get involved!’ Quinn replied.

Using Shadow Equip, Quinn equipped the mask to his face, and made contact with the castle. The message got through and had eventually reached Paul.

"Paul, this is an emergency, just listen!" Quinn said as he fired out blood swipes against the others, and used his shadow to block their oncoming attacks.

’If his cape can block attacks, then I’ll just have to use my own fists!’ Quinn, took the hit from Kyle dead on, and instead delivered one of his own, clawing through and touching his skin. It was a hit for hit, and he knew this would cause more pain due to the fairy blood.

The biggest problem was how fast each of the leaders were, making it impossible for Quinn to fight them all at once. Now with one of them screaming in pain from the fairy blood. The shadow was used to block an attack from Prima on his back, while he performed a hammer kick on David, breaking his arm and sending him tumbling across the floor.

’Is he really able to take on three of them at once?’ Jin was observing the whole thing, still undecided until this point. ’I have to join in.’

Now, even Jin was involved with his blood explosion who had been sitting back the whole time.

The shadow didn’t work well against Jin’s explosion blood ability as it took up many of his MC points.

Seeing him join the fight, and not having taken out the other yet, Quinn needed to finish his message to Paul.

"Right now, I’m being accused of killing Dwight, the Royal knight. I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, and I don’t know what’s going to happen to the people or castle, but protect them at all cost!" the message was delivered, and the call was hung up.
