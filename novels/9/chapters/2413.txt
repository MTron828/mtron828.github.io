A new person had entered the pit, and as soon as he started speaking, it almost felt like everything had frozen. None of the werewolves were moving in for the attack, the Champion also was just holding onto his axes.

Hikel and Chris were taking this time to recover, since both of them had received pretty serious wounds. It wasn't smart for them to attack, and they wondered who this person could be that had caught the attention of everyone. 

From the outside, it looked like a male, but it didn't look exactly human, just like everything else they had seen in this world so far. Yet, it was the first thing that was around the same size as a regular human in size.

'Wait a second, haven't I seen one of these things before?' Hikel thought. The image soon came back to him. 

It wasn't from the red space as they were in now, but it was back in the other world where they had come from. When they were on a rescue mission to get Jessica back from Magnus, that was when they had seen them. 

The portal had been open for a short while, and demons started to appear, one of them that had appeared in front of the group, looked exactly like what they were looking at now. 

It had a pair of wings that were folded up close to its body, but they weren't feathered wings, instead they were webbed more so like a bat's. On a closer detail though, the see through hollow part made it look more like they had fish scales all over its body, the main thing though, was the deep dark blue skin on its body.

Hikel's memory was right, what he was looking at now was one of the great demon races created by Immortui, a Freytlin. They were the demons of the sky that were spread out on nearly every planet, and were also the highest in number compared to any of the other demon races.

The person who had just landed was one of the Demon kings, Tenbris. With his arms folded, he was observing the situation again.

"Sent by Immortui!" Unzoku shouted with anger in his voice. "Do you think I would just believe your word? If he has something to say he can always say it to me. And you know the rules, each Demon king has free reign to do as they wish in their territory! So why are you getting involved in my business!"

At first, when seeing the presence of a new strong figure, they thought that this was truly the end for them, but with the way the two were arguing maybe this was the fracture and chance they needed.

Tenbris let out a big sigh.  Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Do you really think I am bothered by what you do in here?" Tenbris said. "You see, recently we have had a troublesome invader, and it looks like Immortui has gone to deal with him, himself." 

Both Chris' and Hikel's ears popped up as soon as they heard this. If it was a recent invader, they could only think of one person.

'Shouldn't Quinn have already been here for a while though?' Hikel thought. 'Unless there is a time difference in this world and our world. I guess not every world is created the same. Still, it looks like Quinn hasn't gone head to head with him just yet.' 

Tenbris was careful with his words because he could see that the Champion was currently in the pit as well. If news got out that one of the demon kings had been defeated, then they would know that the invader was strong. 

ραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm "Deal with the invader himself?" UInzoku laughed. "How bored must Immortui be?"

"Regardless." Tenbris cut him off. "I have been given orders. To make sure that the champions don't act up, and if they do, then you have permission to devour them." 

This had come as an even bigger surprise to Unzoku. He knew how much Immortui treasured the Champion's strength. Stating that he wanted to use them in the up and coming war against the celestials. 

However, he always thought that it might have been some type of an excuse, one that was to stop Unzoku's growth so he wouldn't get stronger than Immortui, so why now of all times would he be allowed to eat the champions. 

Unzoku was thinking about what to say, because there was a hint of betrayal for a moment. 

'Should I let him know about it… no, with the way Tenbris is, he would just kill him on the spot, rather than allow me to eat him. He's scared too, but then what about the others, I want to eat them too. If I'm able to eat all three of them… I wanted them to get to their peak, but it would be better to eat them now than to not eat them at all'I think you should take a look at

"Well, from the looks of things, there were some others that must have gotten in through the portal somehow." Tenbris said, lifting up his arms. From the ends of the arms, in the palm, a small swirling blue ball could be seen gathering. 

The ball's energy was getting dark, and the parts of the ground were lifting up. 

"Let's get rid of them first." 

Out from his hands, two large dark blue vortexes of power came out. They headed in two separate directions, one going toward Hikel while another went toward Chris. 

'No!' Unzoku shouted in his head. 'If those attacks hit them, there'll be nothing left after the attack… and that attack it's impossible to avoid!'

Chris and Hikel could feel the power, and rather than try to attack straight on, it made more sense for both of them to move out of the way. They lifted their feet and tried to move but the direction they were going was straight towards the attack. 

It felt as if they weren't even in control of their own body. 

'This attack, does it have some type of gravitational pull?' Chris thought. 

It was too late for both of them, they hadn't stored enough energy to try and combat the attack. They could only do their best to cover themselves to defend from the attack.

"You are both useless!" A voice said. 

A swift sound was heard cutting through the air, and the next moment one of the blue vortexes, the one in front of Hikel had completely disappeared into nothing. Meanwhile the other blue vortex had crashed into the side of the wall, destroying everything in its path and was continually burrowing its way through the wall like a ground-eating worm. 

"Oh, there was one more of you hiding?" Tenbris said. 

Standing in front of Hikel, was none other than Russ, with the black sword in his hand, and next to Hikel, Chris was there as well. Moments before the attack had hit, Russ had used the shadow powers to transport Chris from there to here. 

He had to do it quickly so he could use the black sword as it would make his own ability void when using it as well. 

"And I thought I was the bad one." Russ said. "Don't you think the numbers are a bit unfair? I just want to make things a little more even."
