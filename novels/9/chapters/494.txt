Chapter 495 The final Verdic

Seeing how nervous Quinn was before touching the ball, was starting to make the others feel nervous as well watching by the sides.

'Was it possible Quinn was lying? Or was there something else worrying him about the whole thing.' Logan thought as he could see his hand ever so slightly shaking as he was about to touch the ball.

Then finally, both hands were placed and the ball and then....

The flames above the tenth seat grew in size and started to move about furiously just like before. Seeing this, Quinn couldn't help but let out a smile and quickly let go of the ball. He did this just in case like when the tower had stopped, he thought the flames would too.

"So he really is the tenth leader. Then why didn't Vincent pass on his powers?" One of the leaders asked.

"How and when did this happen, did Vincent make an illegal and pass it on to him?" The mumbling continued, and the Royal knights suddenly let out a little bit of their energy, to remind the others just who was in the room at the moment, and it fell silent again.

"It is not our place to discuss what he did or why he did it. The simple fact is that Quinn did not lie. He is the tenth leader, and he has returned. When planning our decision, we had two scenarios of what to do. One if you were the leader, and one if you were not. But there are still many problems we have to solve.

"First, you yourself being a leader has changed the outcome of Fex's crime. A leader is allowed to create a vampire, so The Wight was never illegal in the first place. The tenth's population has not reached the maximum amount, so there was no crime on this part.

"As for Quinn's actions, two of them have claimed to have been sworn blood brothers. Making Quinn's actions justifiable in trying to save his blood brother. I am not a fool and understand that Quinn being as weak as he is, if he was to state he was a leader no one in this room would have believed him."

The leaders remained silent as they continued to hear the king give his verdict and his reasoning for doing so. Some of them wanted to contest and argue, but deep down, they knew this was true as well.

"But it doesn't change the fact that Fex had lied to all the leaders present. Not telling them of who had created the Wight and informing them of the truth. His punishment and abandonment of his position shall remain the same. He currently does not belong to the thirteenth family, nor will he get special privileges as a direct descendent. He will no longer be able to obtain the position of a leader."

Hearing these words, the sadness in Lee's eyes grew. He had planned great things for his son, and wanted him to take his place. Now that just wasn't possible.

"My king, so are you saying there will be no punishment for the tenth leader?" Bryce asked calmly, trying to contain his anger. "I understand you have forgiven him for the attack, but even before that, there were reports of him killing the direct descendants. He has even brought humans to this establishment."

"You are correct." The king replied. "The verdict is not yet finished, but there has been some new information that has been received. Clark has changed his statement from before, allowing it to be more accurate. Would you care to share Clark?"

Clark, the vampire knight who had fought with Quinn on the bat planet at that time, stepped forward from his leader's Jim's side.

"The direct descendant's death, I believe, is my own fault, for not caring for them properly. When I arrived at the scene, I saw an unknown vampire standing there and three dead students. I had at the time only assumed that he had killed them, but did not see it with my own eyes."

Quinn didn't know why, but for some reason, Clark and Jin had decided to change their statements, making it more favourable for Quinn.

"That's crap!" Bryce shouted. 'Of course, it was him."

The system then, whispered something into Quinn's head, something that would clear the situation for them all. He raised his hand, and the king looked over in his direction, giving him a nod allowing him to speak. Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

"If you want, I give you permission to use your influence on me as the tenth leader. That way, we can clear up the students' deaths."

The king ran his fingers through his long hair as he thought about it for a while. He could see the anger on some of the other leaders. After all, their sons had been killed by another leader. If this were to happen, even if they were leaders, there would be some consequences.

Honestly, the reason the current king was being quite lenient on Quinn was because he had some questions of his own. He wanted Quinn to be a part of the vampires, for before he too was close with the tenth, Vincent. But he wasn't sure if Quinn's suggestion was a smart one.

For he thought that Quinn really had killed the descendants and now he might have just been bluffing. But when looking into Quinn's eyes, he could see a glint of confidence.

"Very well." The king stared directly at Quinn and his eyes shined bright red.

This time, Quinn wasn't able to even resist at all, he had been taken over in an instant. 'Is this the power of a king?'

"Did you Quinn Talen, Kill three of the direct descendants?" The king asked a simple and direct question. The influence skill always worked best when it was used this way.

The others, seeing he was under their control, Quinn answered there and then.

"I did not."

The influence was broken, and with that, the answer for them was satisfied. The king not wanting to go onward with this matter anymore, had decided to continue.

"How did you know that would work?" Quinn asked.

"Because Quinn, you didn't kill them. It was the Bone Claw. The influence skill can only say nothing but the truth." The system replied.

"As you said, there are still more matters, and the decision shall be left up to Quinn, the tenth leader. Concerning the humans he had brought with him, they are not allowed to know of the settlement. Therefore we have chosen to give him a few options.

"First, the humans are to be killed." Hearing the first options, those on the side nearly dropped to their knees. Hearing such an influential figure talk about their death so easily, it was quite the shock.

"Second, their memories are to be removed of all of this place and events of ever happening, before being returned. And thirdly. They are to be turned into vampires to be put under the tenths control."

Hearing this, the others felt a little better, but Logan and Vorden were not happy about the options given. To lose their memories or be turned. They didn't like the sound of either of those things happening.

"Before I make the final announcement, is there anything the others would like to bring up?"

There were many points Bryce wanted to bring up, and the same with Muka, after all, his vampire knights were killed, but he still had found nothing solid at all. But the decisions had already been made, and the current king was much about unity. He would want to try to bring everyone together as quickly as possible.

They knew of this because they had already discussed many different matters before this one in the last meeting without Quinn.

Many Vampire knights needed to be replaced as well as a new leader to be found. A ritual would have to be made since the leader had died before choosing a successor. Something like the death of a leader hadn't happened in a long time.

Then, Arthur was the one who raised his hand.

"While everyone is here, I thought it would be best to ask my own question. What happened to the punishers when I went into my slumber? When I woke up, no one was there." When saying this, his playful tone wasn't there like usual, and his shadow was seen slightly flickering above his shoulders.

"I thought you would ask something like this." The king replied. "The truth is Arthur, we don't know what happened to your people either. You know I was always on the punisher's side when the events of the last civil war happened. I actually wanted the punishers system back, and... I was even going to ask you if you wish to have your position you once had again."

The sudden look on some of the vampires faces dropped when the king had suggested this.

"Because of this, I regularly had someone check on your establishment from time to time, and then one day there was no one. They had all gone. I'm afraid I have no clue what happened that day."

Arthur carefully scanned his eyes around the room, there were a lot of frightened faces on some of the leader's faces. More so then they should have been.

'It looks like some of them know more of what's going on then the king?' Arthur thought.

"So what do you say Arthur, do you wish to return to the position you once held?" The king asked.

If Arthur was to stay at the fourteenth castle. Then maybe there was a chance he could find out the truth and do some investigating. But when thinking about this, the image of the human Shelter he had looked after appeared in his head, including images of Ruby.

Was he going to leave those people?

"I must decline your offer. I believe you have done well so far." Arthur said. "I Believe as long as the correct king is elected then you will do fine without me. Although I will be happy if you still treated me as an important guest from time to time."

"Of course." The king replied.

The king then stood up from his seat, signalling the meeting was about to end as he said his last words.

'Then, before I end this meeting, I have one last thing to say. Quinn Talen, is now the tenth leader. With this, he shall be treated as such and has become part of the council. He shall perform his duties as a leader just like everybody else here, and his first task will be deciding what to do with the humans he has brought with him. The meeting is now over."

As soon as the king left the room, all of the other leaders left as well, not even looking at Quinn. While all of his friends remained at the side.

"This is what I was afraid of Quinn." The system said. "Now they know you are the tenth leader. You are to remain here forever. If you choose to leave without their permission, you will be treated as a criminal."
