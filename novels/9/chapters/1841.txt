Chapter 1842: Stronger Sides.

Sailing through the endless sea was the giant mesh of equipment put together to create the almighty Ship, known as Rein, a suitable name given by the Pure faction. It continued to swim through the sea as it always did.

The Ship itself never anchored near land, as there was always smaller freight of battleships that would be used to complete the trade-going from the giant ship Rein to the smaller places that Pure had their base on.

There were two new members who had been here for a while now, and they received a grand treatment on board the Ship. Erin and Flora were staying in the same room on the Ship Rein.

They were on the very top floor of the Ship, which was reserved for agents Four, One and Zero themselves. There were powerful friends that would help them at times and were allowed on the top floor, but these floors were generally for the leaders of Pure.

Either way, there were not many arguments about these two new quests. For one, the public was unaware of what had transpired. They had no clue about the red vampires, nor did they know that the Dhampirs had almost been annihilated.

To them, the world continued to exist as it always had. At the same time, the higher ranking members in Pure had always believed they were working with the Dhampirs on the side anyway, this was now more of a direct relationship, and they could do with having such strong forces on their side.

Agent Four himself was just pleased that he had a new toy to play with, figuring out how the blood crystal would work or specific ways he could use it. The only one that seemed to be unhappy about the whole thing was Chris.

However, his word could never go above Agent O's. In the end, no one in Pure was loyal to him. They were all devoted to Zero because he could give them what they wanted.

Currently, Erin and flora were not in their rooms but instead on the outside in the fresh and open. On the very top of the Ship, above the floor where they would stay, there was a landing pad.

This was designed for spaceships to come and land on, although not many did come, so it doubled up as a training place as well. With permission, Zero had granted access to Erin and Flora to use it.

The space was large, almost the size of around three football fields. The ground was also solid, allowing them to train to their hearts extent.

Erin held onto the large Ice blade with the flame grip. The demon-tier weapon that initially belonged to Oscar was now in her hands. She charged forward and held the giant longsword down her side.

Lifting it, she swung it down, with a large force of Qi, crashing into Flora's blade. An explosion was heard, and smoke filled the area of the two, but looking out the end of the other side was Flora, and in her hand was the legendary sword that belonged to Arthur.

"Your weapon is a strong one, but you can't just rely on it. Stop thinking so much about using all the powers the sword has." Erin lectured.

"Remember everything you have learnt, and try to use your ability and the sword. Do not forget, the weapon you hold in your hand is not the only weapon you can use!"

Hearing this, Flora then threw out a yellow aura slash with her own hand rather than the sword, while at the same time, using the string ability, she swung the sword out toward Erin.

The only thing was, with her bare hands, Erin knocked the yellow aura away into the sky while using her sword to block the incoming sword.

The training between the two of them continued at an intense rate and watching it all was Zero from one end of the large platform. There was a viewing deck-a place where people went on after landing for snacks, drinks and more.

From time to time, events would be held on the large platform, with stands as such up here. The room they were in would be used as a dressing room for the ones putting on a show.

Today though, like many days, Zero was a spectator with Chris by his side.

"What do you think?" Zero asked.

"They are strong." Chris replied.

"They have good weapons, and that Queen of theirs has a ridiculous amount of Qi that could be measurable to mine."

"Although, to be honest, I doubt she has gone all out in any of these training sessions against that little pupil of hers."

"However, we already knew she was strong when she defeated Laxmus, which is why I'm telling you to be careful. Do not underestimate her just because she came here to ask for help."

Zero continued to watch for a while, as he was fascinated at the two of them fighting before giving a reply.

"If we are to start an all-out war against our enemy. then we have to be prepared for all those who will or might intervene to help those people."

"Logan Green, Jake Green, The Blade family, Andy, from the Vampire Corps, Quinn Talen and his damned Gang."

"There is even the Dalki-looking one that fought against you. I also do not doubt that the Graylash family, whom I push came to shove, would get involved on their side as well."

"Currently, as things are, although people see both sides as even, it's only because we have the majority support of the people. So if they make a move, they will be seen as ruthless and power hungry."

"The people will think they are the ruthless ones who will do anything to get their way, simultaneously destroying us, the logical and fair ones. Bringing these two on board is a must."

Chris understood what Zero was saying. It was why they had tried so hard to get the Chained on their side before things had messed up. However, these days, now that the dhampirs were with them, Chris was wondering if there was another way.

"Based on everything I just said, Agent Four and I will leave for a while. A planet with a suspected nest of demon-tier beasts has been discovered."

"Their weapons and power will do well to improve our forces if we do go into a fight." Zero explained. "Which means you will be in charge of this entire ship while I am away." Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

The look on Chris's face showed he was surprised, this was unexpected, and he hardly knew Zero to go off like this.

"Wait, aren't those from the Green city coming here soon? Will you be away for that as well?"

"Correct." Zero nodded.

"Without a doubt, they will think the meeting is a trap. But, with my presence gone, maybe they will feel at ease. As for what you wish to do in this meeting, I will leave it up to you."

"Talk about working together, bridging connections, give and take of land and power. Whatever it takes just to delay them into thinking we won't act any time soon."

Just then, they heard a loud bang, and the whole top floor started to shake. When looking out the glass window, they could see it was from the two training, and flora was on the ground, severely injured.

"What about the two? You don't expect me to hide them, do you?" Chris asked.

"If those from Green City see them, they will immediately think that this is a trap. In fact, they might start fighting us right here, trying to get rid of us all!"

A smile appeared on Zero's face as if he was expecting that response.

"Don't worry about them. They won't be here either. They will be coming with me."

"Since they will be working closely with us, it only makes sense for us to work closely together on this."

"Besides, I plan to clarify who works for whom in this treachery." Zero answered.
