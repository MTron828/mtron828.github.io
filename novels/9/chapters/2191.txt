The shadow power had always been a great defensive measure, and while Quinn continued to grow so did his shadow powers. They only got better in terms of defence and the things it could do.

There was the shadow infect skill but that still wasn't really an offensive skill either. In order to try to make the shadow more versatile in battle, Quinn had attempted to fuse it with his Qi. This had worked, giving it a solid form.

The only thing was, this only allowed it to still be used in a defensive way, and to grab onto or hold things better. It could be used to attack in this form but it was weak, and it was better for Quinn to use his Qi in a physical way or with his vampire aura if that was the case.

So, what about his blood aura, mixing it with the shadow. For the longest time, Quinn thought that this might be impossible because of the trait of the shadow itself. It was meant to block everything out and slow things down from the original way they worked.

However, Quinn believed that it was possible, it had to be if he mixed them in from the root of his body, and inside, rather than trying to mix the two powers while they were already out of his body.

It took a lot of attempts, but with extreme concentration he could do it. Heading inside his own shadow space wasn't only to get away from Asura, it was also to allow him to mix his two powers and he was successful in creating the Blood Shadow.

The only problem was, the effects of the new found power, was not what he had expected at all. For a while he thought it was ineffective and useless. Up till now in all of his fights, it was something that wouldn't have helped him much, until now.

'Asura is physically stronger than me, he is naturally faster than me if I wasn't using the Nitro Accelerate and he has more energy than me. In a way, he is almost exactly like Ray, but I will still win this match, because I have so many people counting on me.'

[Nitro Accelerate activated]

[Blood supply will be used]

Quinn dashed forward with the glowing red shadow covering his hands. As he ran, a trail of the red shadow could be seen coming off from his back as well. At the same time, the red glow around both of his hands were getting brighter and brighter in colour as more blood aura was being put into the attack.

'I trained in that celestial space for years, honing my fighting style, I continued to grow stronger no matter who was in front of me and it will be the same here!' Quinn's hand turned into a claw shape.

He ran with both of his arms by his side, and an image of a black dragon was formed out of the lingering shadow behind him.

Asura, braced himself as he screamed into the air and his whole body was covered in energy, he stomped both of his feet into the ground, and threw all six of his fists forward, all of them aiming for both of Quinn's hands.

The blood dragon had hit Asura right on his large gauntlets, and a pulse of energy was emitting from the two clashes of energy hitting each other. Quinn was gritting his teeth pushing forward.

"HAHA, I thought you had something special when you came with that attack but now I see it's nothing to worry about!" Asura boasted.

With the power of the attack fading away, Asura was able to leave just two arms to hold onto Quinn's fists, and with his other four arms pulled them back, charging them up. He threw them forward right towards Quinn's head ready to finish him off.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

"Now!" Quinn said.

As soon as Quinn said those words, a force of power had hit back all six of Asura's fists. The four that were mid air, were swung back slightly, and the two holding onto Quinn's hands had been pushed back as well.

It was clear by Asura's face he didn't understand what was happening, Quinn hadn't moved, he couldn't move because he was holding onto him, and it felt like almost an invisible force had hit him. He didn't have time to worry about why though, because his body and face was now wide open.

Quickly, using all the speed and strength Quinn had, he punched the body of Asura multiple times, the blood shadow still covering all of his hands. With the Nitro accelerate Quinn was good enough to get a few hits in, and he didn't just go for the body he went for the arms as well.

While Asura got use in his hands again, Quinn jumped back, just enough so he was out of range from Asura.

"You little brat, what are you doing!" Asura shouted.

Once again, just as Asura was about to attack again, he could feel pain all over his stomach. It was hurting all over as if he was getting punched just like before, but Quinn was away, and it looked like he was charging up for another Blood Dragon attack.

When the pain stopped in Asura's stomach, suddenly he felt the pain in his arms and a force pushed them away and open again. He was defenceless and Quinn hopped in at that moment jumpin in the air, just above where his head was.

[Dragon Blood palm]

Quinn thrust both of his fists right in Asura's face, his legs were lifted from the ground and then his whole body slammed right into the ground. Quinn jumped away before Asura could retaliate, but just as he was about to get up, a large force just as strong as the palm strike hit him in the head again, pushing him further and deeper into the ground.

'Its working‚Ä¶ the power of the Blood Shadow is working.'

Quinn was ecstatic, against someone like Asura this was the perfect person to use the skill against.

The blood shadow didn't increase Quinn's strength in any way, but it did allow for his blood aura, his Qi and natural physical capabilities to completely pass through the attack. The shadow wasn't getting in the way allowing him to fight like normal.

However, when testing the attack there was something strange about it. If Quinn was to punch a wall, then naturally a large crater would appear in it. If he was to do this with the blood shadow, the same size crater would be created, but a moment later, and the same attack would hit the wall again, at the exact same spot, and with the same amount of power.

Quinn didn't quite understand the phenomena behind it. At a guess he thought it had to have something to do with the shadow properties. It was designed to slow things down. When Quinn blocked with the shadow he wasn't blocking but slowing things down.

If he was to stay in the same place with the shadow long enough the attack would eventually come through, and in this case, this is what he thought was happening now. Due to the mix, his attack wasn't being stopped and was going through, but maybe the shadow was also storing the attack, slowing it down, and later pushing through the attack on the target again.

Either way, the hardest part of using the power was getting the timing down to be used in a fight. It took a lot of skill to work the timing where it could be useful. Which was why Quinn was a bit nervous since it would be the first time he would be using it in a real fight.

Yet it was working perfectly, now Quinn could block with the shadow blood and he could deal twice the amount of attacks and also disrupted his opponent's rhythm.

'With this power, I will win, without having to use the Demon form!' Quinn exclaimed, as he could feel a rumbling right beneath his feat.
