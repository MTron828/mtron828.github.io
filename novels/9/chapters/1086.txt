Chapter 1087 - The Recording

The rattling of Void’s hands hitting his camera wouldn’t stop. Void had seen who was on who were on the other side. Those that they had been fighting against, the humans with red eyes, and yet, he had just seen Quinn, the leader of the Cursed faction, have the same glowing red eyes.

’I’m sure of it, he used the red aura power as well, but he seems to be on another level compared to the others.’

"It’s Quinn. Are you talking about who you think I am? What’s he doing here?" Bonny asked.

She was surprised, and for a split second, she had forgotten about the dire situation that they were in.

A few seconds later and the wind was felt going past both Void, and Bonny’s faces as thier hair blew back, and Quinn had disappeared entirely from their front, too fast for them to see.

’ I have to record this. I have to find out what is going on!’ Void thought as he spun around and turned his camera in the direction Quinn had gone.

The first set of vampires Quinn had hit were no longer able to fight, and quickly realising that they now had some form of backup, Hermes turned around to try and hold off the Dalki with his other men, firing out thier lightning abilities.

’"I can smell it, it’s a lord. What is such a high ranking one doing here of all places!" one of the men standing behind the Dalki said.

Quickly four more men jumped and ran on each side of the walls, heading straight for Quinn.

"If you can no longer fight, then you know what to do!" The man commanded.

At that moment, after hearing those orders, the first vampires that had been struck and were on the floor had raised their hands and slit thier own throats, killing themselves instantly.

’They know I’m a vampire and that I’m a lord. Are they killing themselves so I can’t gather any information from them? I was going to use the I influence skill on them, but now this has become troublesome.’ Quinn thought, as one vampire went to strike him, but Quinn, even though moving his hand later, then the vampire had grabbed the man’s face before reaching him and started to scr.a.p.e it along the side of the walls.

’I learnt a lesson from Arthur that day, that I don’t need to be nice to those that are trying to kill me!’ Quinn said as he lifted the vampire’s body at the right time as another one struck, allowing him to dig his sharp claws into his own companion.

Quinn then kicked their legs, breaking them. And with his other hand free, he grabbed onto the other ones face. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

’I need to help the others as soon as I can. I can’t try extracting and asking questions now; otherwise, it will put others lives in danger. I guess there’s only one thing I can do.’

"Now, you can do what you want with your lives," Quinn said as he left them screaming in pain. With only one outcome.

Something was strange about Quinn, his eyes were more determined than usual, and he had his goal in sight.

Some might have thought that Quinn was exceptionally cruel in this instance. However, this was all due to what he had seen when he had entered the ship.

The crew, the mechanics that worked on the docks had all been slaughtered. Most of them were not even fighters who had families, the people who worked as cooks and more. Every single one of them were killed.

Some were done by the Dalki, but it was clear from the teeth marks left on thier bodies that vampires did others.

The vampires coming from the other side, Quinn leapt from one side of the wall to the other, and while mid-air, he swung both his legs firing off two blood crescent kicks.

Quickly, Quinn used the shadow eater skill on the two on the ground once again.

’What is going on?’ The vampire at the back thought. ’He was confident due to the two spiked Dalki by his side, and his turner had assured him that this would be an easy job. However, for a vampire lord to come out of nowhere was something he was never expecting.

’Most of the lords are vampire leaders. Did he come from one of the castles, but I don’t remember them? And they have the power of the punishers. Who is this person?!’ The vampire couldn’t help but think.

With the other four vampires gone, Quinn threw out another swipe towards the vampire, who seemed to be their leader in the back. He quickly raised a wall of blood. The wall was shattered, but using blood hardening, he was able to stop the blood swipe.

’I stopped the attack. With the Dalki by my side, we should be able to take him down. I’m a vampire noble not too far from becoming a lord, I think, I can do this!’ He thought and started laughing.

"Just because you’re a lord, you think you can win this. You’re too arrogant." He said as he pointed towards Quinn.

"Why are you so confident? Is it because you blocked my swipe from earlier?" Quinn asked. He then raised his hand and threw out the attack once more, it looked similar to before, and the vampire was ready.

"I’ll warn you the first attack. I wasn’t using my full power because I wasn’t trying to kill you." Quinn said.

The noble was confused l. He had seen a red aura, but suddenly it was no longer there, and soon he could no longer think as his body was split in half.

"I wish you could have been useful and at least given me some MC points," Quinn said.

After Quinn’s arrival and dealing with the vampires, the two spiked Dalki were quickly taken care of, and everyone was beyond amazed at how easy Quinn had made it look. The five men that had travelled with him had only just arrived through the halls as they had lost him long ago. Although they were happy to know, the fighting was over.

Everyone alive wished to thank Quinn for what he had done, but instead, he had decided to go around the ship, searching for any more vampires or Dalki. If he found a lone vampire, perhaps he could restrain them before they killed themselves to ask them a few questions.

Unfortunately, although a few more Dalki were found, there were no more vampires.

Even searching the dead vampire’s bodies, there was nothing noticeable on them. They were perfectly disguised as faction members and according to others, they had been part of the factions for years which was why no one had suspected a thing.

It didn’t take long for power to return to the place and everyone to gather in the canteen. Here Quinn released the injured for them to get a looked at.

While in the canteen, despite him wanting to leave as soon as possible, tears of joy and thankful words spoken by the others were unable to make him go. People constantly approached him, thanking him for saving thier lives and eventually, part of the Earthborn group had arrived.

Leading the Group itself was general Innu.

"You seem to be in a rush," Hermes said to Quinn, who was stood off to the side with the more senior members of the Graylash family.

He wasn’t particularly in a rush, but his next step was to head to the planet where Owen was on. In the canteen itself, Innu and his people were doing the usual running an investigation.

In the corner of the room, Void and Bonny were a little worried about something. After the fight on the ship had ended, they had decided to film the wreckage and carnage of what was on board, and during their tour, they had run into Innu.

"Hey you, is that a recording device. we will have to take all the footage you have on there as evidence." Innu said, pointing at Void.

"Wait." Void said, worried about what exactly was on the footage. At the moment, Quinn didn’t have any glowing red eyes, and he didn’t really know what it meant. He was unsure if it was a good thing or a bad thing, but it was already too late as one of Innu’s people had already taken the camera.

’I hope this doesn’t stir into something big.’ Void thought.

After Innu had finished barking out orders, he started to walk over to the others and Quinn, who looked like he was ready to leave.

"Quinn, where are you planning to go, you did a good job here, but it looks like you still have something on your mind? Innu asked.

Quinn was about to ignore Innu anyway, despite him asking in a more polite way than he usually would, and was to head out on the ship he had come in.

"If it’s about Owen, don’t bother. I think I know you by now. the fight...is already over." Innu said, and the next bit of information he told everyone had caused thier jaws to drop to the ground, and Quinn’s heart beat faster than ever.
