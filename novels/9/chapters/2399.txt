The celestial space where time moved slower, and where the gods resided to make deals with each other while observing the many planets in the Golden Space, was peaceful once again.

It felt like something was happening in the celestial space, and great events were going on one after the other. Many of them still remember when BB had entered and decided to face off against the celestials one after the other, attempting to destroy as many as he could.

They remembered watching the fighting celestials go up against the god-slayers of Earth and the eventful fights one after the other. It had become a big event among the gods because everyone felt the pressure that there was a good chance that the Ancient Ones would get involved.

Still, there were some things that were kept secret, Quinn's escape, him becoming an agent for the gods to eliminate other god slayers, and the fact that Immortui was behind many of the grand events surrounding Earth and was attempting to escape.

All of that felt behind them now as the celestials concentrated on doing what they did best, fueling their conditions, feeding off the celestial energy that they would gain.

For one celestial there was a big difference in how they would spend their time, a celestial that was relatively infamous among the others.

"Hey, I was wondering which planets would be best for my condition?" a celestial asked.

"Ah, you know who would have known the answer to that, the all-knowing Xox!" another answered.

"Xox, oh yeah, he used to talk to everyone, and he knew a lot about the planet's history and everything, but I haven't seen him around."

"That's impossible, he practically lives in this place."

"No, it's true. He hasn't been around, I think Xox must have left this place, his days of I guess being an informant are over, but it makes me wonder, what is he doing now, after a life of living in the Celestial Space, what can he do?"

As for the infamous Xox, he was currently on a particular planet, looking up at the blue sky on a shady white beach. He had buried half of his body into the sand. The heat of the sun warming up the sand was nice and cozy for Xox.

"This is a nice relaxing feeling... I don't know why I used to worry myself so much going after celestial points." Xox said.

By his side, a large hole had been made in the sand and it was filled with seawater. Laying down in it like a hot tub was another celestial, Yongbu. The celestial of the Memerials.

He too was relaxing as he laid there side by side with his friend. The two of them didn't know each other well before, but as fate had it, the two had run into each other quite a few times, and then the two of them had even been tasked with a high-level job from Mundus, a very stressful job.

Now it was the end of it all, the two had decided to relax a little, to not get involved with celestial business. Not try so hard to meet their conditions because it seemed lately that it would just bring the two of them trouble.

"I'm surprised how relaxing this is, after all we used to just do nothing in the celestial space all the time." Xox said. "I have lived a long time, and I guess just not fearing for our life is best."

"I agree, I have even decided to not get involved with the Memerials and cut loose my ties with other celestials on planets to complete my condition." Yongbu replied.

Although part of his reason was for fear of meeting BB again if he did get involved.

"Speaking of, you know there was something I never found out." Xox replied. "What was your condition?"

There was silence from the two of them for a while, as if Yongbu was trying to decide whether it was a good decision to tell Xox or not.

"Ah heck, we both have our embarrassing moments, I will go ahead and tell you. My condition is to have as many living beings know how to swim as possible." Yongbu answered.

"What..What!" Xox repeated, shouting their second time. "I thought conditions were meant to be things that the universe deemed necessary, and if that's your condition, then why did you get so involved in those living with the Memerials in the first place?I think you should take a look at

"I mean, your entire race where you came from can swim. Why don't you just go to other planets teaching them the great ways."

"Do you think, I could live that down?" Yongbu said. "The other Celestials would critique me, and think of me as a not so powerful god, then taking advantage of me. It's much easier going to planets and creating a disaster involving water, that way they are forced to learn to swim, or decide to teach it to those in the future."

Although Xox now knew the details of Yongbu's condition, he still didn't know the exact details. For some celestials, conditions were easier than others. For example, those that could swim, would Yongbu get celestial energy from that, or was it only those that could swim due to the result of his actions.

It was the same for maybe one who had the condition of death. Did they get celestial energy from all those that died naturally or only those through their meddling.

"So let me ask you a question, what is your condition, does it perhaps have something to do with why you spent all your time in the Celestial Space in the first place?" Yongbu asked.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

"I just want to stay out of trouble now, the less I'm in the celestial space, the less chance there is of Mundus or others asking us for help, right!" Xox excitedly said.

Yet, there was then a strange feeling around his body. He could almost feel it turning into nothing but energy particles. His physical body was turning into something similar to the celestial body he would have in the celestial space.

This was something that had never happened before, at least not in a forceful way like so. Eventually, his whole body disappeared. Yongbu blinked a few times looking at the hole left in the sand, Xox was nowhere to be seen.

Reappearing in his energy form, Xox was in a dark space. It was completely black with no sign of light at all, apart from that which came off from his own body. It made it impossible to see just how large the space was.

In a panic, the ball-shaped celestial was flying around all over the place. This wasn't the celestial space, so where was he, and how was he dragged here? In the back of his mind, he had a theory of who it could be, but why would they want to contact him.

"Celestial Xox." A booming voice was heard directly in Xox's head. It sounded peaceful and gentle as he heard it, but that didn't make Xox feel at ease.

"I am in need of your skills to go unnoticed as an informant." The voice said. "I need you to keep an eye on the Earthlings and report back anything you find out that is strange, and to also keep an eye on Quinn.

"Of course, I don't think I have to tell you, but no one is allowed to know of this. Not a single celestial is allowed to find out, and that includes Mundus. If they do the consequences will be grave for you."

After everything Xox did to avoid situations like this, he wondered what he had done to deserve this type of treatment or get involved with all these large figures.

The voice didn't explain why; the voice didn't say anything yet, because he knew Xox would follow the order. Just as quickly as he arrived, he was sent back and found himself in the hole in the sand he had created.

"You're back, where did you go?" Youngbu asked.

Xox didn't say anything, but he was sure of it—an Ancient One had made contact with him.
