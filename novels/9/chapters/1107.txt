Chapter 1108 - Two heads collide

Quinn wasn’t a master of Qi, nor did he understand all the things it could do. He was even unaware of how Lucy, Layla’s mother, had been able to give up her own life to heal Layla at that time. He had been sure that all the effects on Layla would only be temporary.

However, since it hadn’t disappeared after all this time, it should be safe to assume that it would stay with Layla. Additionally, since she had never trained her own Qi apart from what little she had done with leo, there should be room for her to improve. From what Quinn had heard, Leo had said that she was a slow learner. ​​

Even with him using all his knowledge, it would have taken her half a year to show any type of results. Which was why Quinn had set up a test, a test for her to fail.

Right now, checking her, it looked like the Qi vessel was ready to burst at any second.

With this new knowledge, and knowing how frustrated Layla would be if left behind, Quinn stipulated this condition to allow her to accompany them to Blade Island.

She was to go find Nate, and learn how to use Qi with him. To see if maybe a second teacher would fare any better. If before it was time to leave, she could learn how to use Qi to a degree where it would be useful and strengthen her attacks to a certain level, then she should be able to take care of herself on the island.

’I didn’t take you for such a cruel person.’ Vincent commented, after Quinn had presented Layla with a new goal. She had immediately accepted it and before he could ever say anything she had rushed off to Nate.

’How is this cruel, if I simply don’t wish for her to get hurt? I might be unsure what exactly I feel for her, but there is one thing that’s crystal clear. I don’t want to lose her.’ Quinn defended his actions. ’I know Qi can take a long time for some people to learn, but there’s still a chance and she has tried before. With her mother’s power inside her, it might even cause us to have another Cursed monster on our team. We will just have to see how she does.’

Left alone, Quinn decided to head off and look for Sil. He was wondering what state of mind he was currently in. He had seemed mostly fine during the Demon tier hunting expedition, but with them soon returning to his birth place it would be normal for him to be nervous or feel all sorts of emotions.

Quinn headed to the school area on the Cursed ship, a frequent place for Sil to relax at, due to him getting along with the other kids from Blade Island. Before he turned around the corner, Quinn happened to overhear a conversation.

"I just want to say... thank you, Shiro." Sil said. "That ability will help me bring back my friends."

"Please, you don’t have to be like this, Sil." Shiro replied, sounding nervous like he didn’t know how to react. "I’m just happy to help anyway I can. You know the second they said it was to help you out, I agreed in a heartbeat."

"You saved me back then. If I had gone too far....I don’t know what would have happened to me, but your words, everything you said and everything you did has made me who I am now. So no matter what, I will do everything in my power to help you get your friends back! Afterwards... Maybe I can also become friends with them."

Hearing this, gave Quinn a bit of peace. Sil seemed to be as calm as ever and even thanked Shiro first. Something that Quinn had never expected from a child like Sil. It seemed that knowing that Vorden and Raten were coming back would please him, although this was only the first step.

Even if Shiro did get the ability, they still needed bodies for the two of them, and Quinn didn’t want to use the so-called clones that Eno would create. That would be a temporary fix to the whole solution, if anything. They needed Shiro to learn the ability so they could rely on Eno less, but it was impossible to completely not rely on him.

From the sounds of it, Shiro and Sil were about to take a tour of the ship and with Quinn’s worries settled, he could go off to do his own thing. As he walked around the ship, he heard the announcement that the docking bay for the spacesh.i.p.s was opening up.

"Someone arrived?"

Knowing this, he thought it would be best for him to also make his way and meet them there, and along the way, he bumped into Brock and Eno.

"Quinn, I have to say so far things have been going very smoothly for you, but that’s because it seems that Jim and the Dalki are completely unaware of you." Eno said as they continued to walk.

"At the moment, the Cursed faction is just another group that Jim has to worry about, but once he learns the truth of your identity and the reaction you have to all of us, I’m sure you will become a bigger target than anyone else. I just hope you’re ready for that."

However, Quinn didn’t feel the need for it to be mentioned, he was already preparing for the Dalki or Jim to come after him at any second. Especially since it seemed like there was a chance that they already knew about Blade Island.

When they arrived at the docking bay, Quinn could see that the guests had already exited from their ship, and he could smell it instantly as they walked of, four vampires were guarding a female in the centre, who was descend in dark clothing and had a large pointy hat on top of her head. It was Mona.

’So there are vampires working for Richard, after all... but just how many people does he have under him?’ Quinn wondered.

"Have you forgotten that I told you that I had eyes and ears in all sorts of different places? You didn’t think all of my work was just done by me and Brock. However, don’t worry, nearly all of them are just clones of myself, with the transformation ability. Allowing them to change their appearance at will."

"It would be creepy if I just saw myself this whole time."

Quinn understood the logic behind that, but if ’nearly’ all the vampires that worked for Richard were clones, who was Brock?

"Who is, Brock?" Quinn asked, not being shy about the question.

"Oh I thought you would never ask, Brock here is an ex Royal Knight. He was my Royal knight during my time of becoming king, and he had helped me a great deal throughout the times. Of course , he used to have a different ability but I changed it to help us more with our situation."

"Changed it? Like with Truedream’s ability." Quinn asked, since Richard appeared to be in a sharing mood.

"Not quite, as you know we have already talked about the tablet more than once. It is a special thing, more so than you know, and it can do amazing things." Eno explained, as they continued to walk forward.

Quinn already knew that the tablet was indeed special. He had read all about it in Arthur’s journal who had been obsessed about it at one point. That the probability that all the abilities that were currently in existence had originated from there.

"Finally, it looks like I’m out of that place. I never thought you would let me leave." Mona said when she looked at Richard and Brock, then she finally laid her eyes on Quinn.

"I’m surprised you are involved in all of this." Mona said.

He was unsure how much exactly Mona knew, did she know Richard Eno and the others were vampires, what they had planned to do, or was there something else. Through a brief conversation while he was escorting her on her way to Sam, he found out that Mona had been brought up to speed.

She didn’t know anything about vampires yet, just that the man who had saved her from Hilston, was Richard Eno, the great scientist, which was why she didn’t fear for her life and felt indebted towards him.

When she asked about his relationship to Richard Eno, Quinn claimed that he was his grandfather, the only reasonable thing he could say, and she was starting to get a better picture of everything. The details of what they were about to do, and why they needed to do so were also shared with Mona, and once this was all done, she would stay by Richard’s side, at least until the war was over and done with.

"That damn Hilston, that kid has one crazy grandfather!" Mona said, referring to Sil. "I can’t believe what he did, but it sounds like he at least got some sort of payback from you guys. I just hope we don’t run into him again."

Quinn also hoped the same, but he knew that they would have to face him eventually. The best thing to hope for was that it wouldn’t happen right now. It felt silly to worry about a human, of all things when they were in the middle of a war with the Dalki.

With Mona now here, there was only one person left that they needed to wait for and that was Helen, which meant they didn’t have a lot of time before they were to head off. A short while later Helen finally arrived.

Once again, Quinn had gone to greet Helen as she had gotten off from her ship.

"I’m thankful that you have managed to come here, on top of all your duties." Quinn said.

"Don’t be silly." Helen replied. "You’re my leader and future husband, after all. I’m not just going to be one of those wives that just sit back and let others do all that work. Whenever you need me, of course I’ll be there."

As usual, Helen was quite headstrong and upfront, and it was a type of personality that Quinn didn’t mind, but just didn’t really know how to deal with. Now that Helen was here, it meant everyone was there to embark on their Blade Island trip. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

It hadn’t been long since Sam’s announcement had passed, perhaps eight or so hours had passed, but Quinn had no choice.

"Do you mind if we make a stop?" Quinn asked, as they took a detour and Quinn headed to one of the training rooms, where Nate and Layla were both in. As soon as the door was heard sliding open.

"You." Layla pointed at the woman. "I challenge you to a duel and the loser will have to submit to one request from the winner!"
