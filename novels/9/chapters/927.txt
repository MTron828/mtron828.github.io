Chapter 928 - Shadow Overload

As Quinn’s transformation was finishing up, and all the leaders, including Cindy could see what he had become, what he had turned into. The reaction he had gotten from her wasn’t what he was expecting. Swinging her head backwards, her eyes widening, she started laughing while pointing her finger towards him. It was as if she had gone mad.

"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!" Cindy said. "My father was cast out of the vampire settlement for turning into a bloodsucker, and now a vampire leader has become one in order to save it!"

Jin could no longer stand and moved to the edge of the plaza and was now lying against what used to be a small shop, but he couldn’t believe his eyes, for Quinn had turned into those beasts.

’Something is different?’ Jinn noticed, and he wasn’t the only one.

Bryce had been taken on stage to rest with the others, by Kazz who was tending to his wounds. They had to be careful about bringing in human blood as a way for the vampires to heal. Because right now, any amount of blood that would be shed would also aid Cindy, making her stronger.

"How did this happen? Did Quinn give in to the bloodl.u.s.t? Did they do something to him while he was locked up?" Kazz wondered. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

"No," Bryce grunted, looking onward. "This is different. Did you notice that he didn’t drain himself of blood or show any signs of addiction before this? He simply turned into one at will."

If this was true, then right now, there was a good chance that Quinn was a sane Bloodsucker like Rowa, giving him a chance to do something.

For a second, Bryce had to stop himself because he had hope for the boy.

Wasting no time, Quinn was off from his position. He was aware of everything happening and could see Cindy getting ready to throw one of the large circles of blood she had in her hand, but before she could, he was already behind her.

He swung his arm downward, hitting her red armour. Not a single dent appeared in the strong blood armour, but the force continued through it, and if Cindy didn’t allow her body to go with such a strong force, then it was quite possible her arm would have even ripped off.

Instead, her body was flung down with her arm, and it was crushed into the ground stronger than ever. Even though the armour wasn’t broken, the shear force had crushed her arm and blood could be seen seeping through her clothes and falling through the gaps in the armour.

"He’s so fast!" Sam said.

"This is what happens when one becomes a bloodsucker." Silver explained. "But they tend to lose their mind only focusing on one thing."

Those from the Cursed ship didn’t have to be informed. They knew what a bloodsucker could do. They had lost one of their most treasured members because of it, Blip.

’No, this can’t be!’ She thought. ’A Bloodsucker shouldn’t have this level of intelligence. Its attacks are meant to be wild.’ As she thought this, she could see that Quinn was already going for her other arm as well. Making her realise the truth.

’He’s completely sane. He can control the Bloodsucker form just like my father.’ Seeing this was a surprise, and for a second Cindy was startled, but she soon realised that it was nothing to be worried about at all.

When Quinn went to grab onto the other arm, the armour on her body started to light up. Blood flowed from her injured arm, moving to the other side of the armour, and it was beginning to activate.

"My own blood is still blood!" She screamed, and the armour started to brighten up more, but seeing this, Quinn had moved quickly away and was no longer holding onto her.

One of the biggest weaknesses of the Bloodsucker was that they had low levels of health. One strong attack and he would be done for, and he was sure that Cindy wasn’t going to be light with her attacks.

’What was that? What was she about to do?’ Quinn asked.

’I...I don’t know.’ Vincent regrettably replied.

’What do you mean you don’t know? That’s the famous blood armour? Aren’t you some famous researcher? How can you not know what the armour does?’

’How would I know? The absolute blood book and the armour were reserved for the kings, and I have never been king. Maybe if I saw it being used in combat, I could make some educated guesses, but I never did during my time. It’s not my fault that you seem to attract trouble wherever you go.’

’Can you tell me anything about the absolute blood powers?’ Quinn asked.

’It depends. Information is passed down when learning the book, but just because they know how to use it, doesn’t mean they can use it well. Which is the only reason why you’re still alive right now. Usually, it takes some time for each king or queen to adapt the book to their liking. However, if there was a past King or Queen that had a skill that suits the current one, then we might be in for some trouble.’

As if Vincent’s words were cursed, Cindy had healed her arm up using her ability. She started to gather the blood that still remained on the battlefield and the two circles she hadn’t used before. They both started to form a certain shape in her hand. The blood began to elongate into a thin shape, and soon Quinn could see what they were.

Now in her hands, she was holding two wh.i.p.s purely made out of blood, and immediately swung one out with such force, causing it to break the sound barrier, and a shockwave was let out.

Moving back, Quinn thought he could avoid it, and even though he avoided the most dangerous part, the end of the whip, a blood swipe continued out of the very end.

’It’s going to hit me!’ Seeing this, Quinn felt like he had no choice. He decided to revert back to his vampire-like form. His body started to shrink down, and while in the middle of his transformation, the blood swipe created by the whip hit his body, sending him flying back all the way to the execution platform.

[-80HP]

[20/100 HP]

He didn’t know how he had survived the attack but soon realised that wasn’t the end of it, as it only had touched the surface of his skin. No choice. He had to gather all of his second stage of Qi, and was pushing the blood swipe out from his body, making it so it couldn’t pierce any further, because if it did, then he would be dead.

"Don’t worry, Quinn. I got you." A voice said from behind. Looking behind him, Quinn could see a full-sized Borden had managed to catch him.

"Hahaha!" Cindy laughed. "Look at this power! One single swing and a vampire leader is out for the count. I can swing these wh.i.p.s a hundred times, and a hundred more blood strikes would come out of it just like the last one. With this power, I can finish off anyone with ease."

When Borden let go, Quinn fell to his knees, blood spilt from his mouth and from his wound across his c.h.e.s.t. He still had HP and activated his blood bank, hoping to bring his HP back up, but he was starting to wonder how much help that would be.

"She’s right!" Quinn thought. "This fight, it seems useless, the system was right, and Arthur was right. I’m weak!" Quinn shouted as he punched the stage, causing a hole to be made, allowing him to see the ground beneath.

The leaders seeing this didn’t think the same though, Quinn wasn’t weak. It was just that his opponent was far too strong.

All those around him, seeing Quinn like this, wanted to do something to help him. Right now, he was fighting alone, but even if they did try to help, they feared they couldn’t do much.

"Quinn, you just need a little help," Borden said, as he stuck a syringe in the back of Quinn’s neck. A green liquid could be seen inside the clear glass, and it was slowly going inside of his body.

[Level three Dalki blood has been consumed]

[30 percent increase in all stats]

Quinn was wondering what this was, he could tell that Borden had most likely given him some of his blood, but the effects were different compared to last time. When Quinn had consumed the blood of the one spiked Dalki, the message received at the time was that he had consumed a level 1 Dalki’s blood, giving him a ten percent increase in all of his stats.

However, here it had stated he had consumed a level three Dalki. Turning around, Quinn could see three spikes on his body.

’Is that the reason why?’

A confidence was rising in Quinn, but he wasn’t sure if this was enough, and he didn’t have time to think about it.

Swinging the wh.i.p.s widely, Cindy had fired off multiple blood swipes just as powerful as the others towards the stage, and if Quinn didn’t do something, they would all die.

Thanks to the green blood received from Borden, the 30 percent seemed to also increase his MC points as well, but blocking all of these attacks with his shadow would be useless.

Seeing the attacks coming towards them as well. Everyone who had the shadow ability, their natural instinct was to use it. They readied themselves and had activated the shadow ability.

At this moment, something appeared in front of Quinn.

[Members of your family are using the shadow ability you have granted them]

This was the first time a message like this had ever appeared in front of Quinn, but at the same time, he had never fought by all of their sides before either.

If the shadow was in the hands of Quinn, and this would increase his MC points, it was worth trying.

[Yes]

The shadow under all of the feet of the members who had learnt how to use the shadow ability started to move towards Quinn. As it did, it looked like Quinn’s shadow was consuming the others. Soon it was growing in size, and via the system, Quinn could see his MC points rising.

’This, it’s similar to when Arthur was restoring my MC points that time he was training me.’

The shadow continued to be absorbed, but Quinn was wondering if it would be enough to stop the attack, but at that moment, another message had appeared.

[Enhancement type soul weapon has been unlocked]

Finally, the Enhancement type Soul weapon Quinn had in his system that was constantly greyed out could be used, and with nothing to lose, Quinn activated it immediately.

[Shadow Overload enhancement type Soul weapon, activated]
