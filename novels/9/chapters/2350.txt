All six of Quinn's arms were moving at a fast speed and the barrage didn't stop as the attacks killed everything in sight. There was no sign of the bat-like creatures and they couldn't even be seen pouring out from the portal anymore. 

This was all because of Quinn's attack that was getting rid of them before they could even come to the other side completely. 

From the spaceship that was floating in the air from the side, Agent 4 and Logan were watching everything that was going on. 

"We can't just stay here and watch the other's fight." Logan said, as he tapped the ship's console bringing up a screen of what was going on below. They could see Andy fighting with the others. 

He was using his overwhelming strength to punch through the attacks, some he was taking head on and allowing his body to heal, and other times he was swinging his sword hitting them far and into the distance. 

"It looks like down below has cleared up quite a bit, we need to get to work." Logan said. 

"There is a possibility that they could still hurt us." Agent 4 stated. "The place needs to be clear first." ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

"I never thought you were like this." Logan said, shaking his head. "I thought the low digit numbers from Pure were meant to be strong? What happened to you, although you are a researcher you have strength. 

"Me and you will be good enough to defend ourselves, it's not like we're weak." 

In the middle of their conversation, they heard the loud bangs stop for a moment. The bang's that they could hear was each time Quinn's fists would stop in the air.  Ripples of explosions were being created just from his punches alone, regardless of the aura that was being used with them. 

The reason why Quinn had stopped was because something else was starting to come through the portal. The yellow energy was still hitting the sky, and slowly the portal was opening up wider and wider. 

It had grown almost to the size of a large cloud itself. It made him wonder what a complete opening of the portal would look like. Even when looking in, one was still unable to see the other world clearly, it was almost like a mist that was constantly flowing showing everything as a blur on the other side. 

What was coming through the portal part now though, was a large blue skinned hand. It was gigantic, far bigger than anything the others had seen. It looked like a human hand apart from the skin colour, and the sharp coloured nails. 

'This is even bigger than Athos.' Quinn thought. 'And it is bigger than the demon tier dragon as well. Is this another demon?'

Both Agent 4 and Logan could see the giant hand slowly moving out.

"Oh, will you look at that, the area, it looks clearer than it did before. I think Andy is doing a really good job after all, why don't we head down." Agent 4 for some reason seemed to quickly change his mind, and Logan could guess why. 

Seeing the giant hand, Quinn decided to do something first. This looked different from the demons he was fighting just a moment ago, and from its power it certainly was different. 

'Is this on the same level as the other demon I killed, the one that had come out of the portal last time? Didn't Minny tell me he called himself a general or something?' Quinn thought. 

He was unsure if this giant creature was on the same level of the demon general he fought last time or was stronger, but just in case, he gathered a blood fist, and threw it out right at the hand. It hit the centre of the palm. 

It didn't cover much surface area at all, but the attack was strong, strong enough to cause the hand to be pushed back and flinch a little. 

[Demon blood has been absorbed]

[Blood aura is unable to evolve]

[Blood aura is at a higher level]

The system seemed to give him a bit more information than last time, and he could only assume it was because this was a different type of demon, and that wasn't the last of the system messages either.

[A variety of Demon blood has been absorbed.]

[The system is now able to create a Demon tier list]

[Demon]

[Lesser Demon]

[Greater Demon]

[Demon General]

[The list will be updated as the system gains more access to different blood types.]

'Oh, this is very interesting. It looks like after absorbing their blood I can tell what strength the demon is at, and then using my inspect skill, I can see the grade of the demon.'

Looking at the large hand, the inspect skill was already active, and where it would show nothing before, it now had a word by it. 

[Greater Demon]

Quinn looked past the giant hand and could see one of the bat creatures he was fighting before, he was wondering what strength that would be at. 

[Demon]

'The lowest grade, and they were that strong. I can imagine that some of the vampire leaders might have struggled against just those bat creatures. Still, the Demon general tier I was able to beat with the guns last time.

'This isn't any stronger, it's just bigger, so I'll just need a bigger weapon.' Quinn thought to himself. 

The extra arms disappeared. He was fighting against a mass amount of enemies, and although he probably could use them to eventually destroy this giant demon he thought there was a more efficient way. 

With his blood aura, one of his most favourite weapons was created in his hand. A giant blood spear had been formed, but not only that. With the power of the gauntlets, Quinn was also able to add the additional effects onto weapon that he would make, just like the blood fists. 

'I have the blood fairy type fist, Qi fist, and Dhampir fist. It would be nice to add one of these to the spear to see how effective it could be, but the dhampir energy might have an effect on the portal as well, so I have to be careful.' 

With that carefulness in mind, Quinn had opened to apply the blood fairy effect onto the spear.

"Go back to where you came from!" Quinn shouted as he hurled the spear. 

It spun while in the air and went right through the palm of the demon's hand, ripping a large hole in the centre showing nearly only the fingers. It carried on going through the forearm, but beyond that, he had no idea how far the spear went. 

When looking closely though at the greater demon, the fingers, they could be seen turning a slightly different shade of blue. 

'Is this the effect of the fairy blood?' Quinn thought. 'Although demons aren't vampires. Vampires are demons. These are creations of Immortui, or beings from the other world. 

'Since fairy blood affects vampires, I thought there was a good chance it would affect demons as well.'

Sooner rather than later though, the giant hand started to turn into small particles, before he could even test the effectiveness of the fairy blood. 

'Although I was unable to see the effects, I'm sure there will be more that will come through that portal… and it would be good to test out how effective all the different traits are that I can add, before I decide to leave this place.' Quinn thought.
