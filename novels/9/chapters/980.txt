Chapter 981 - A waste of time!

Standing by the side, Kazz knew straight away that Quinn had done something. As the last time he had fought with Cindy he had done the exact same thing. When Quinn’s soul weapon was active, a faint purple glow would appear around all of the shadows Quinn used.

One of the main benefits of using the soul weapon ’Shadow Overload’ was the fact that Quinn could now use the shadow as he wished without the need to worry if it would run out or not. However, this wasn’t the reason Quinn had decided to use it now.

The Boneclaw’s teleportation speed was far faster than before. But there were more than just one benefit of using the soul weapon. Quinn’s soul weapon would also improve his casting speed with the shadow when using skills, and the general movement of his shadows.

’Not that I’m going to need it, Quinn thought as he held out both of his hands, and started to create a dome of shadow over the Boneclaw. The Boneclaw would teleport out of it the same as he did last time, but seeing where it was now, Quinn would quickly summon another dome over it again, in an instant before it could react.

’It looks like my guess was correct.’ Although the Boneclaw was able to teleport out of the shadow dome, it wasn’t able to attack at the same time and it didn’t seem to know exactly where it was teleporting to. It seemed like it would take a few seconds before it repositioned itself and noticed where Quinn was.

While in the dome, the Boneclaw was unable to see, so it couldn’t focus where to place its black teleporters. The only thing it could do was look in a certain direction in the dome, and cast a portal to the other side to escape, and soon, when it was busy coming out of one of the shadows, Quinn was appearing directly behind it through his own shadow with a large hammer strike of his own.

However, the Boneclaw was fast, as it managed to create a large portal the same size as Quinn in front of him, and sinking through it, Quinn was redirected to another place, causing his hammer strike to strike one of the buildings in the inner castle area nearby.

A loud bang was heard as his fist went through a building wall, and a couple of the ones behind it crumbled to the floor. Still, Quinn wasn’t worried. Compared to last time, he had more MC points to play with. What he didn’t realise was although Shadow Overload allowed him to use the shadow as much as he wished, he could still only control only slightly more than his MC points allowed at one time.

With his MC points above a thousand, Quinn was able to control a larger amount of shadow. Having created several domes, he was still able to protect himself using the shadow.

"So you seem to be quite the quick thinker, but I have a lot of tricks up my sleeve!’ Quinn shouted as he fired out a blood bullet into one of his shadows in front of him, and it appeared behind the Boneclaw, going through its forearm.

This was a skill that was too quick for the Boneclaw to react to, and when it turned around, it could see several circle shadows floating in the entire area. Quinn had spread them around, hovering as if they were land mines all over the field.

"I think I’ve got the hang of how far you can teleport at once. Try teleporting somewhere, and you’ll run into any of these," Quinn said, as he activated a disk with a razor edge, covered in the shadow.

’If I throw it into any of these shadows, I can redirect it to try to follow the Boneclaw, and I can also throw blood swipes and even escape through them as well.’

In a way, Quinn was using the shadows as a better version of the teleporting skill that the Boneclaw could use. Quinn was able to go through one shadow, and appear out of any of the shadows hovering about at any time.

Quinn was ready to throw the Shadow disk into one of the shadow portals, but stopped himself just seconds before, as he saw the Boneclaw turning into a black mist, and it was soon heading towards Quinn.

"Did I win the fight?" Quinn wondered.

’I don’t think you won.’ Vincent replied. ’I just think the Boneclaw has accepted you again, for now.’

Hearing this, Quinn didn’t like it one bit. Was Vincent saying that he might choose to challenge him again in the future? He already had a headache with Arthur and now had to worry about the Boneclaw as well. It was also safe to say that Quinn was beyond annoyed. He had used the Shadow Overload skill, and now he also had to face the backlash of using it.

He didn’t even get to use it fully or for a long time. It was as if the Boneclaw said, show me everything you had, and then decided to just go away when Quinn did.

[Yout total MC points are now ’1150 points’]

The amount of points lost wasn’t a deal-breaker, but it wasn’t like Quinn could easily obtain points through using the skill Shadow Eater either. Technically at the moment each time he would use this skill his MC points would lower, so it was best not to use it for now.

The other problem was right after using the soul weapon, all of his MC points would go down to 0. Even though he didn’t use much of the shadow in this fight compared to with Cindy. He would now have to wait for a period of time for them to restore. If he had used a skill like this against a demon tier beast and then ran into Hilston, he would have been a sitting duck not being able to use his shadow ability.

’Just a word of advice to you as a past leader.’ Vincent said. ’Although I wasn’t the best when it came to hand to hand combat, and you are currently better than me when I was your age, for a vampire your skills are quite poor. You only know the basics, something taught to the regular vampires, but you are a leader.

"Since you use gauntlets as your weapons, it would be best for you to try and further develop your fighting skills. So far, you have done well, relying on powers such as Qi, and mixing it with your vampire powers, and also the shadow, but what if you are unable to use both of those things? Just like with the Boneclaw in the future, there may be an opponent that will need these set of skills."

Honestly, Quinn couldn’t agree more, but it wasn’t like he knew any grand martial artist. Leo was the closest person to one, but he was a master swordsman.

’I wonder if there’s something I can do?’

’The second point.’ Vincent continued, although we have already discussed this, it’s about your blood abilities. It’s all well improving your blood control, but just like with the shadow, you need to learn more advanced blood skills. They are currently quite simple."

’Couldn’t you teach me, since you used to be a great leader and all.’ Quinn said.

’I guess I could give it a go, but through words alone, it would be hard. It would be best for you to see the skills yourself. Maybe you should get friendly with one of the leaders at some point.’ Vincent half jokingly said.

Still, Quinn didn’t think Vincent was giving him enough credit. Quinn didn’t show the Boneclaw everything he had, and there were even the new shadow skills he had yet to test.

Seeing the Boneclaw disappear like so, Kazz was relieved, but witnessing Quinn use his special power again, she truly did feel like she was looking at one of the strongest vampire leaders. Even if he was lacking in certain areas, no one could deny how strong he was.

"Well, let’s forget about that little thing, shall we?" Quinn said, looking back at Kazz. "Let’s get back."

The incident with Quinn’s familiar wasn’t something that needed to be urgently reported, since it was his own familiar and didn’t involve others. No one had even seen the fight, but Kazz still reported the matter to Bryce. After all, she was loyal to him as he was her father and even more so her king.

Although, Bryce didn’t think much of this, and was far more interested in the reports she had made earlier.

"You may leave now Kazz, you did a good job. Thank you." Bryce said, sitting down on the king’s throne.

When Kazz left the room, out from the side as if he was almost invisible, Tempus stood.

"You heard about the wall, right?" Bryce asked. "Do you think you will be able to restore it to its former self?"

"Perhaps, we might not get the whole thing, but we should learn something, but I’m wondering what you plan to do with such a wall?" Tempus asked.

"I hate the shadow, but everyone has to admit their power, but the reason why so many people disliked the shadow in the past was because it belonged to the Punishers, a force equal to that of the king. This is something that should have never happened. It’s time the king had its set of own shadow users." Bryce smiled. "I bet Arthur will be pleasantly surprised to see them when he returns."

"And how do you expect to get past the doors without informing Muka?" Tempus asked.

"Oh don’t worry about that, I have more power than you think. Actually you might already know. Otherwise I doubt you would be standing by my side."
