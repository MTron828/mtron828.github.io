The Demon form was something Quinn was unable to use against the previous god slayers because in all honesty, he had no idea what the power was or what it did.

It was possible it would be a bad match up against his opponent or like the previous Blood Sucker form that the Demon from had taken over, it could have down sides.

The Blood sucker form doubled all of Quinn's stats but he was unable to use his powers and his HP was at great risk.

Due to the many powers he had gained including that of Qi, his current form mixed with the powers were stronger then his Blood Sucker form, which was why he had stopped using it.

However this was different.

'I need to fight it, I need to stay concious!' Quinn thought. 'Even though there is low risk due to the opponent, there is still a risk and I need to know what this form does.

'I was able to find a way to keep my mind with the Blood Sucker form, so I should be able to do the same here!'

Staying in his own mind, Quinn could feel changes to his body and they weren't only internal changes they were physical.

One of the large changes to his body was something he had experienced before, as it felt like something wanted to rip out from his back and they did. Two large wings sprouted out ripping through his skin, they looked like pieces of flesh at first, as they were covered in blood and had a light pink colour to them. As they grew out and fanned out more, the sheer size of them looked far too big for the body of Quinn, almost like a butterfly, but were still sharp and jagged more like a bats.

It wasn't the end of pain for Quinn, as he could still feel great pain from his back, and right underneath his shoulder blades where the wings had sprouted from, something else could be felt ripping right through his skin.

To his shock, it was another pair of wings, these ones quite a bit smaller compared to the large ones, reaching the same length as his arms could.

After the wings, the extra growing parts didn't stop there, Quinn could feel his whole body stretching out, getting larger but not in a muscular way like it did when he transformed into a Blood sucker.

HIs natural body was growing in size all over, while he was still conscious he made the quick decision to put the armour in the shadow space. He was still able to use his powers but the transformation wasn't over yet.

From the top of his backside, a long black tail sprouted out, it had a thick base that would gradually get smaller, but towards the end there was a special point that was glowing red.

The tail wasn't the last part that spouted out from his body, that came from the top of his head, just like the tail two black Horns had come out. They were quite thick at the base, and narrowed out to a sharp point and just like the tail, the tips of the horns were glowing red.

'This demon form, is such a diffrence compared to the Blood Sucker form.. they're not the same at all...and why is my mind being filed with...' It was confusing for Quinn, he couldn't even think what it was being filled with.

Emotions were coming over him, and he could only think about trying to suppress these thoughts so he didn't lose his mind, so he didn't lose consciousness, he was hanging on by a thread.

Finally the last changes were occurring to Quinn's body. When looking at his hands, he thought his skin was going paler, but that wasn't the case at all. It changed completely, it felt rough to the touch, his skin felt incredibly thick, and it was turning completely white like snow.

The white skin, was covering his entire body, most of his clothes had already ripped off due to the size change he had, leaving only little around his private area.

The white skin had spread over everything including his wings. There were only a few parts that didn't turn white. Around his arms, similar to how Quinn's gauntlets would look, it was black skinned from the elbow to his finger tips.

It was clear that it was part of his skin, and the black part of his body almost looked as if it was a different material. The same pattern of black skin occured on his feet as well, covering it up till his knee, fading into his white skin.

Then there was his glowing eyes, glowing completely red to the point where nothing else could be seen. The transformation looked like it was complete and Quinn couldn't take it anymore.

Placing both hands on top of his head, he held onto the horns. Pulling on them, it almost looked like he was going to rip them off.

"I am in charge of this body!!!" Quinn screamed, "I am in control."

Was he fighting against inner demons, did this from bring on another personality, or¬† was he borwing a power from someone? It was none of these thigns.

This was all Quinn, this was his own power, his vampire power in its purest form and it was doing its best to try and get Quinn to follow its will.

Mundus was watching everything from the side, wondering what this was. It was clear to him now, that the secret that Quinn wanted him to keep was this. This was what he wanted to hide from the ancient ones and he knew why.

'The power I am feeling from him, its simliar to Immortui. It almost feels like there is a second one in front of me, but rather than a celestial we have a god slayer on our hands, this could even be more dangerous than Immortui.'

Mundus had done a bit of research into the vampires after learning of Quinn and the humans. In the frist place, the vampires were a creation from Immortui's power and Immortui's condition was simple.

The more lives lost due to him, then he would be fufilling his conditon. He was a god of death. Which was why, it was only natural for the vampires to feel the urge to kill, the urge to fight.

Right now, Quinn didn't even seem like a vampire and was closer to Immortui himself, which was why his mind urged him to kill. Whether Quinn was wasting his time or not, trying to fight off this urge it was hard to say, but looking at him now it looked like he had lost.

Quinn lowered his hands away from his horns slowly, he stood up straight and tall, as all four of his wings stretched out.

"ARGHHHH!!!" Quinn screamed at the top of his lungs, his voice was being projected so loud that no matter where one was on the planet they would have been able to hear the noise.

At the same time, waves of red energy were flowing out from all parts of Quinn's body, the ground beneath him, the area around him all of it was being destroyed, disintegrating by the second.

His body was sinking into the ground as he stood there as the floor was withering away by the second.

'With this power he might actually be able to do it, he could truly be the first to beat the Behemoth!' Mundus was shaking with excitement while lifting his own hands. He was trying to block the waves from hurting him but it was impossible and in the end he had to use his power.

'Even though I have stopped time in front of me, it still feels like I can feel this power through the time stop. Is it still active, what tarnation is going on.'

Looking at Quinn closer, it wasn't just vampire aura coming out from his entire body, mixed in with he red waves where those of black and white, they were sparking off in all directions, like thousands of volts of lighting emitting from his body.

It was then that the Behemoth for the first time had stopped walking, and turned around to look at Quinn.
