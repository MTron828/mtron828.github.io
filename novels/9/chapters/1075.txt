Chapter 1076 - The fat cat

Erin felt a headache coming up. Not only had that strange girl called Bliss come up to her without being asked, now she was speaking in riddles. It was hard for her to judge whether the girl was just someone crazy, or perhaps someone affiliated with Pure. But if it was the latter, then why would she have willingly appeared in front of her?

"Don’t you think it’s pretty rude to tell someone you have just met something like that?" Erin questioned her with a nervous smile. "How about you start explaining yourself, for example who exactly you are, before I really might be causing some chaos here."

Looking around the room, the dhampir checked if there was anyone else in the room with her. There was no scent of a vampire or such, else her body would have reacted strongly by now, and her own ability couldn’t sense any Qi apart from her own... unless someone here had an even greater Qi control than herself, which would mean she was in great danger.

Raising her hand, Bliss pointed towards the screen at the back, it looked like the fight was about to commence.

"I’m not here to hurt you, Erin, so why don’t we just enjoy the match and see if my little prediction turns out to be correct." Bliss suggested. The dhampir was still sceptical, but if the other party had wanted to hurt her, would she have shown herself so willingly and openly?

For now, she decided to remain vigilant, but also check out the spectacle.

Both Leo and his opponent had stepped into opposite sides of the ring. Leo placed his hand on the hilt of the sword and was ready to draw it.

’I will take out the beast and not harm the man by his side to make quick work of this.’ Leo informed his familiar on what to do.

’There is no need.’ Ovin replied. ’I didn’t choose to follow you so I could just laze around all day. I could have done that in the Familiar World as well. Besides, if you were to act now, won’t that reveal who you are to the others?’

Leo trusted Ovin quite a bit, the connection the two of them had formed allowed them to understand each other, yet the blind man couldn’t help but think that his partner was contradicting himself. Since he had come here, all it had done was laze around.

"Let the fight begin!" The host announced and rang a bell.

As soon as the match officially began, their opponents, beast tamer Max, as well as the ’Mighty Cruncher’ showed off their teamwork. Max jumped onto the crocodile-like beast’s back, as the creature charged towards their opponents at a frightening speed. Its jaw was opening and closing just as fast as its legs were moving.

The cat just stood there, and soon its eyes started to glow in a fierce yellow. The next moment yellow mist started to surround it.

’You lowly creature, how dare you b.a.r.e your fangs at me?!’ Ovin shouted, yet to the outside world it sounded like Ovin had let out a loud bark. That’s right, the fat cat hadn’t let out a cute meow but a fierce bark like a dog.

Those watching the transmission found it hilarious, but those inside the colosseum regretted coming here. The bark was deep and menacing, and struck fear into all those present, most of all Max on top of his beast as he was the closest one. The beast tamer felt his whole body shake and his instincts told him that the fat cat was far more dangerous than any other beast he had ever encountered.

He pulled out a beast spear from his back, too afraid to get close to the cat. His plan was to stab it while riding on top of his beast, but the next moments, he leapt through the air as his tamed beast had stopped moving, frozen in fear.

’Did I lose control, because I was too scared?’ Max wondered. However, as soon as he tried to reconnect the link he had with the Mighty Cruncher using his ability, nothing seemed to work. He didn’t even notice when the cat had lazily hopped on top of the other’s beast to whack it with its paw.

’Now sleep!’ Ovin shouted into the poor creature’s mind. It looked like a cute action, but the force behind the action was enough to slam the reptile head into the area and leave an imprint. Nobody was surprised that all of the Mighty Cruncher’s teeth had shattered in the process.

’This is your punishment for not knowing your place!’ Ovin harrumphed and looked over to the beast tamer. Fear overcame Max and he quickly knelt down.

"I give up, please let me get out of here!" He begged shamelessly, afraid what might happen to him if the cat could deal such damage to his beast with a simple cat paw.

It was dead silent and everyone just watched the fat black cat leisurely walk back to its owner. As if everything before that had been a mere illusion, and yawned once more and laid down on its stomach.

’This body is tired. Pick me up, please.’ Ovin requested as he rolled around on his back. Leo didn’t hesitate to comply. The familiar had done a great job, so he put him back on his favourite spot, his own bald head.

"What just happened, did we just see a cat defeat an advanced tier beast in a single hit!"

"Yeah, I thought it might have been a joke candidate or something, but that’s not the case at all. Do we know what tier it is? It has to be Emperor tier at the very least, right?"

"We should never judge a beast by its size."

The spectators in the crowd were the first to recover and they instantly started to talk about what they had just witnessed. The host was the next, who hurriedly declared Leo the winner, as everyone was already cheering for him.

"That little cat was even more impressive than I thought. I knew it would be strong but it surpassed my expectations." Chris said, as he was watching from a special area with other members of Pure.

"Do you still not have any information on the bald guy and that cat? Focus on it, and tell me as soon as you find out." Chris ordered, and started smiling.

’That man, it looked like he was going to face the beast on his own at first, I wonder if he’s strong as well.’ Chris thought.

Back at the tavern, most were ecstatic that the cat had won. Apart from those who had bet on the Mighty Cruncher to earn a pretty penny, everyone else found it quite hilarious and frightening at the same time. Many were even wondering if they had one beer too many.

"I think you might believe a little more about what I have to say now." Bliss said, smiling at Erin. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Usually, even after something like that, Erin would have walked away, but for some reason the advent glow of energy was coming from this person. It reminded her of her long lost mother. It felt so warm, that she just felt like she could trust this person’s words.

The two sat down, as neither one was too interested in seeing the other matched. They both turned looking towards the bar.

"Alright, I can listen to you, but you better start to make more sense than your chaos stuff. Only a few people should know about that cat, so did you just guess that it was powerful? More importantly, how did you know about me?" Erin asked.

"Straight to the point." Bliss replied as she sipped on the drink she had ordered. "As you know, people have abilities, and I guess you could say that my ability allows me to see great catastrophes that will happen in the future."

"My visions show me bits and pieces, and it eventually led me to staying on this planet and finding you. I’ve foreseen the two of us meeting in this bar and speaking, just as we are now"

It seemed pretty hard to believe that someone could have such an ability that would allow them to see that far into the future. If the military knew about this, they would have snatched this person, and used her to prevent many catastrophes.

The only reason why she was inclined to believe this girl a bit, was because Cia, who was a banshee also shared a similar ability.

"Let’s say I do believe you having this ability, what did you mean earlier when you told me I would become ’chaos’? Are you saying that I’m going to be the one that ends up killing everyone? How can that be?" She wondered.

For a brief second, she saw Bliss looking towards her left arm that had the chains underneath her clothes, and naturally Erin tried to pull it away.

"It’s a conclusion I came to after gathering all the small pieces." Bliss admitted. "I’ll be honest with you, I have long since attempted to interfere in the things I was shown, but I’m afraid that interfering has done no good so far. It seems like the visions even include my future involvement. I have also tried not to get involved, but then my visions seem to still come true anyway!" Bliss sighed as if she was annoyed by this whole thing and she really did look troubled.

Thinking about what Bliss had said before, Erin wondered if Bliss could be a subtype of vampire like Cia. It was hard to say based on what visions exactly she saw.

"If that’s the case, then why have you come here? If the outcome will be the same either way?" Erin had to ask, wanting to get a clearer picture of what she meant by those words.

At that moment, Bliss stood up and grabbed her staff as if she was ready to leave but then looked at Erin one more time.

"The content of this vision is too great to not do anything as the consequences are too far reaching. I’m taking a bit of a gamble by not telling you everything I was supposed to say according to that vision. I can’t say for sure that it will work, but you should know enough to try and prevent it from happening."

"Only once in the past have my visions been circ.u.mvented." Bliss revealed as she walked past Erin. "Trust the Talen family, they have something special going on with them. They were the only ones who had ever proven me wrong."

’Trust the Talen family?’ Erin thought. ’Talen, as in Quinn Talen?’

Erin wasn’t content with knowing just this much. Seeing Bliss go away, she wanted to stop her, but as she tried to stand up, she felt that her feet were stuck in place. She opened to shout at this person but the words from her mouth wouldn’t leave either.

’Is this her doing? What sort of ability can do something like this!’ Erin was panicking.

From a distance, she could hear Bliss mumble a few words with her advanced hearing as she left out the door.

"If he was here, then none of this would have been a problem. Is this really what you wanted to happen? Is this why you placed everything in that giant tablet?"
