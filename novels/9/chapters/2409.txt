The power was surging through Chris like never before, but he didn't let it get to his head, he already had a test of the power that Unzoku had, which was why he was still powering his body with the Qi he always had. 

Breaking through the smoke, a glow could be seen surrounding his clawed hand ripping through the air and he was heading right for the demon king.

"Things are a lot more interesting than I thought!" Unzoku smiled, revealing a row of his back sharp teeth. He moved his hand till it was directly aimed at where Chris was coming towards him, then with his thumb in the palm of his hand, he flicked out. 

Just like the attack before, a large nail came shooting out and went straight towards Chris. Having seen the simple impact that a nail could have, rather than save the strike for Unzoku directly, he had no choice but to swing his arm and clash with the nail mid air. 

'All of this power, just from a simple flick of the nail!' Chris thought, as he pushed against the nail, the two were being held up in the air as shockwaves of power swirled around the two of them. 

Unzoku, who had somewhat predicted this might happen, had another trick up his sleeve. The power in the air was swirling around, and it was heading for Chris. From the corner of his eyes he could see and feel what was coming toward him.

The fur around Chris' body started to move back and forth as if it was under water, but in reality it was being soaked in his Qi energy. Out from his arms the energy blasted out, and pushed away the red energy. 

The extra burst allowed for Chris' nails to break through the single nail and split it into several pieces. The attack continued forward, one part of the nail cutting through his hide and cutting part of his face, while the rest of the nail crashed into the outer wall behind him. 

Twisting his body, Chris then kicked the air with all his energy. There was nothing there, it was only the air, yet he had jumped off like there was some type of platform. Bursting him forward towards the wall, then off the wall Chris jumped again and now was coming at Unzoku from his side. 

'I didn't just do nothing after what happened to Zero.' Chirs thought. 'The only thing I have left is my training. The thing that got me through everything, the goal to make myself stronger than before. If I can't beat those in front of me, then what the heck do I have left!'

After jumping off the side of the wall, Chris continued to move his legs, and each time they hit the air, he was getting another burst of energy, increasing the power around him. What he was using now was a mix of the second stage and third stage of Qi.

With the third stage, Qi could be emitted out from one's body, with the second stage one could coat objects and items in Qi, making them take a shape. Using both of these things Chris was able to create small invisible platforms of energy for him to kick off from. 

Increasing his speed, his power and his mobility while in the air. He could change directions with ease as well, and create barriers of defence for one to have to break through in order for an attack to hit him. 

The biggest drawback was that it used up a lot of Qi to do this. Thankfully, Chris being who he was, he was a person that had plenty.

"Haha, so you dealt with a nail, well, now let's see you deal with the real thing!" Unzoku said, finally making a direct move himself, his hand swung back, and a large wind current could be felt. 

Just from the movement of his hand, a small gravitational pull had been created breaking the ground beneath it. The finger nail that had been ripped off from before, had grown back and now all of the nails had even extended into sharp deadly claws. 

Chris blasted towards him, giving himself an extra boost and at the same time Unzoku swung his hand at the perfect time to hit Chris' body. The swipe had been made and five large lines of white aura escaped from the nails. They ripped through everything, covering the entire air until it hit the side of the wall, shaking the whole pit. 

If they weren't underground and it was just some type of building, the whole place would have collapsed. Instead though, a large chunk of the wall was now missing, with five lines that were in deep, too deep to see where the attack marks had even ended. 

The big question though was what happened to Chris.

'I knew he wasn't a match for me, but I expected to feel some resistance…  Was his power just for show?' 

Once again, when his eyes were playing tricks on him, it was time for him to use his nose, and doing so he could still smell Chris was around somewhere. Like a flash directly in front of him, a red furred wolf was seen. 

'Impo-'I think you should take a look at

Before Unzoku could finish his thought, Chris had burst through the air and right into Unzoku's stomach. All the extra power, all the strength Chris had, he knew that this attack, this surprise, might be the only clean attack he would get so he needed to make the most of it. 

Chris' claws had dug deep into the abdominals of Unzoku, and the blast of power lifted Unzoku off his feet and sent his entire body flying back toward the cellar. His body hit the top of the cellar breaking through and into the wall. 

Parts of the wall fell now, closing off the entrance that they had come from, along with Unzoku's body. Meanwhile Chris was standing there just fine, without a single scratch on his body. 

The armour that surrounded him was glowing a slightly silver colour, sparkling and that too started to fade down. Blood was dripping off from Chris' fur onto the ground, and he let out a big breath. 

Through the whole thing, he was holding his breath trying his hardest to give it his all. 

'That might only work once.' Chris thought. 

He had used the fourth stage of Qi, turning his body into the red werewolf form. With the added boost of power and his Qi, the current Chris was the strongest he had ever been.

Yet he was fearful, fearful of taking an attack head on from Unzoku. Which was why he had used the demon tier armour he had in his possession. After the struggle of dealing with Erin and her armour, Chris knew how important beast equipment was in a fight. 

Seeing how she had used its abilities so well, Chris was set on a task of creating an armour that could do the same thing. Working with his allies, Zenon as well as Logan, they were able to find a demon tier beast that could create armour of the same calibre. 

At the right moment, Chris had phased through the attack, avoiding it completely, and then transformed into the red werewolf. Making his speed go up an entire other level. The multiple bursts in speed and strength would be unexpected for Unzoku and it had worked allowing Chris to get a big hit.

The rocks started to move slightly and as soon as Chris saw that, he started to swing his hands rapidly, Claws of aura were sent through the air, a barrage of them right at the rocks. They were being sliced up as it was hitting whatever it was trying to move from underneath them. 

Chris continued to swing his arms one after another. Until another nail was shot out, it broke through the aura of strikes. As it headed to Chris he swung both of his arms, hitting it and causing it to crash into the ground. 

In his stage 4 form he was more powerful than before allowing him to block it a lot easier.  Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"It seems that I'm learning new things every day." Unzoku's deep voice said. "A grey furred shapeshifter that can turn their fur red. Now that is something that I've never seen before. I can't wait to tear you limb from limb and find out what you are!" 

Standing there, there wasn't a scratch on Unzoku's body. Making Chris wonder how he was going to win this fight.
