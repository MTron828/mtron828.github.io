Chapter 2467 Convincing the last one

After entering the cave and performing those strange actions, Chris had simply walked to one side of the cave wall and sat there, while everyone else stared at him.

"Hey, what the heck did you do? Why did you give Quinn blood?" Peter was the first to speak up. "And why are you acting so... so... I don't know, freakier than usual?"

Chris didn't reply right away. He was staring at the ground as if deep in thought, but he eventually processed what Peter had asked. Before he could answer, Hikel wanted answers too.

"You're going to have to explain in a lot more detail than you just did," Hikel said. "I know you and Edvard are working together, but right now your actions affect us all, so we need to know what's going on."

"Calm down, everyone," Edvard said. "You're not even giving him a chance to speak. Besides, if they had found out already, don't you think the demon king, or Immortui, would be on our tail? If that happened, Sil would be the first to notice, right?"

Sil nodded, and so far there had been no signs of anything. Not even a single one of his clones that had escaped had been dealt with yet, and he couldn't imagine Immortui just letting things be, especially facing a significant unknown threat.

"I'll explain myself," Chris said. "First, Peter, you don't have to worry. That blood is from one of the demon generals. Quinn was the one who requested it. Remember, he's a vampire; drinking blood is like drinking water for him, and that blood is probably supercharged.

"I didn't expect to run into the demon general. That wasn't my original plan, but when I did, I had no choice but to take him out so he couldn't inform anyone, and I still thought of Quinn."

This was an important point to note, and Edvard was happy to hear it. Although Chris seemed somewhat obsessed with gaining strength at the moment, he had a reason to be. Everyone would be lying if they said they weren't a bit frightened by the situation they were in.

Still thinking about Quinn in this tense situation meant he wasn't completely obsessed.

"I already told you all, I get stronger the more I eat... I don't want to consume anyone from our world. The demons will help us grow and give us a chance to fight back. I was just caught, but like I said, I got rid of all witnesses." ChùíÜ√™ck out lùíÇtùíÜst ùíèùíêvùíÜlùíî on novùíÜl/bin(.)cùíêm

"What do you mean by 'all'?" Russ asked.

"All of those that were at the building area," Chris answered.

That wasn't really an answer the others could comprehend because they had no clue, other than Edvard who was with him at the time. But there was one who knew, and that was Pultra.

Her eyes widened hearing the news, her heart beating a little faster.

'He managed to kill a general and all of the Yak at the building site, all on his own? He doesn't even look injured,' Pultra thought.

'The person below me is strong, the blonde one from before is incredibly strong as well, but it seems like the others in this group aren't lacking either. It might be the same for the rest of them.

'At first, I thought it might be better just to try. A life staying in one place or a chance to take it all back. An incredibly low chance, but at least I could have said I tried.

'The memories of what happened to me that day still linger. Even with Calva's words, I found it hard to be convinced. Yet I came on a small hope, and now I think this might be possible, that we might have a chance.'

Pultra looked down at Quinn below. He was the biggest variable because she only had the others' words to go on. But if all these strong people were supporting him and believed he was their hope, there might be some truth to it after all.

"So everyone thought I was going to be the one that sabotaged this trip, yet it was the freaking mutt!" Russ laughed. "And look now, not a single one of you is saying anything to him."

"Yes, because for now, we are okay," Hikel replied.

"Yeah, but you know that if it was me who went out there and did the same thing, you would have said I was selfish, and you would have given me crap for days on end until my ears bled."

The group resumed their usual bickering, and the Skullys, along with Clava, just watched. It was amazing how these people worked together without clashing. Sure, they clashed with words, but they never got physical.

"It's fine," Pultra said. "The building group works separately from the main establishment. Though, they are meant to deliver a report once in a while. So eventually, we will get found out, but we just have to do what we need to do before then."

A calming voice came from Pultra that, for some reason, somewhat stopped the arguing. Now, the group was just resting, Chirs had left the cave once more which nearly stirred up another argument, but he said that it was to wash the blood off from him. He would find a lake or stream of water near by.

In the end, Edvard went with him and they came back fairly quickly .After a couple of hours, the sun began to rise.

"Quinn's still not up," Sil said as he walked over to Calva and Russ. "Everyone, you know what we have to do. There's a good chance we'll have to do this without him; we need to get the blood."

Sil was standing next to Russ and Calva, who agreed to come and attempt to convince Shinto, the last of the champions.

"A word for you before you go," Pultra said. "Shinto will be the most difficult to convince. Even though Calva and I have teamed up... I don't know the full story of what happened to him because I was the first.

"Calva was the second, but remember, Shinto was the third champion to fall, and he accepted Immortui's deal rather than refusing it. There has to be a reason for that. I believe he is genuinely fearful, and from my experience, that is hard to break."

"Hey, if he doesn't want to join us, then it's simple, right?" Russ shrugged. "Those who don't join us but know about us are too high risk, so we have no choice but to kill him."

Those were the final words the three said before disappearing. They were no longer in the cave.

The three Skully's looked at eachother nervolsy, they had somewhat been thrown into this situation, and a lot was going on for them.

"Is that guy always like that?" Anon asked.

"Yeah, pretty much," Edvard answered. "But there's a reason we keep him with us. Because he's strong. I'm sure they'll bring back the last champion."
