Chapter 1004 - Spoiled Brat

A desperate call was made to Quinn, but Chucky was unsure if it had gone through or not. He was too panicked and just shouted a message down his receiver, hoping it would go through and Quinn would know what to do because if someone didn’t step in to stop what was happening, there would be a dead student on the canteen floor.

If this was to happen, Chucky truthfully didn’t know how the Cursed faction would recover from such a thing.

He knew that Quinn was making great efforts to convince others that the Cursed faction was the right place to be, but once this got out, that the Cursed had sent their own men in the school under disguise and ended up killing a student. No one would want to join a group like that.

Grabbing the black balls around his belt, Chucky threw them, aiming for Sil’s legs.

’I’m sorry, Sil! But my job is to protect you, and this might hurt a little!’

However, as the black balls got close, they were stopped mid-air, and with the hand that was free, he slowly made the balls come towards the palm of his hands and held them in place. While the others continued to hold up Zhen.

Once again, another pop was heard as Zhen’s other arm had been dislocated.

"He can do that with one hand. Just how strong is Sil?’ Swin thought, now he was starting to think that the rumours of when Sil had defeated the head general weren’t exaggerated at all. With this level of strength, he could tell Sil was immensely strong. No one currently in the room could stop him.

The reason Sil’s telekinesis was strong was because not only had he gathered the powers of those close to him, but in the morning, still sticking to his task, he had touched other students as well, attempting to find their ability, so Sil abilities were amped up to the maximum.

"Did you forget I have your ability as well?" Sil said, holding the back balls.

"You’re not going to hit me, are you!?’ Chucky shouted. "We’re on the same side."

"Really, didn’t you just attempt to hit me?" Sil replied.

After hearing this response, Chuky knew he was in for a load of hurt. Something had snapped to Sil, and he was beyond reasoning. The balls had left his hands, and the speed accelerated, hitting him in both of his t.h.i.g.hs, crushing the bones underneath his muscles and causing him to fall to the floor.

All thought of Venus and Swin intervening and trying to stop Sil had gone out the window, but not Shiro.

"Sil, what are you doing! Didn’t you tell me not to kill someone before? How I would regret it for the rest of my life. You would too, wouldn’t you!?" Shiro shouted out and pleaded.

"You’re right, because look at what’s happened to me," Sil said in a voice that sounded like it was in pure pain. Shiro didn’t know how heavy Sil’s words were.

"Where the hell are you, Quinn!’ Chucky shouted.

At that moment, the doors opened wide, and someone could be seen running through all the students.

"I’m not Quinn, but I’m just as good!" Peter shouted as he jumped up in the air and entered the open area where the two were fighting, but he stood there still for a couple of seconds as he was confused.

"Wait, what?!" Peter thought.

’Did he not get my message? I thought Quinn had sent him, I guess it was something else, and he doesn’t know what’s happening.’ Chucky thought.

"Sil, stop Sil, he’s gone crazy!" Chucky shouted.

The reason why Peter had arrived in the canteen was due to his soul weapon returning to him. Peter could only create one mud mask at a time with his soul weapon, and when it was destroyed, Peter knew something was up.

Based on the current time, he realised that all the students would be in the canteen. However, he thought Sil would be the one that was hurt and not the other way round, hence his confusion. Seeing Chucky on the floor hurt, and everyone spread out everywhere, he was trying to figure out what happened.

"Sil, put the stupid student down, I know they’re annoying, but this is too far!" Peter demanded.

"Isn’t this our goal? Isn’t this what we should be doing? Getting rid of these people that make the world worse. This is the easiest way. People like him made Vorden and Quinn’s life harder at school. I’m helping everyone even if they don’t realise it." Til said.

Hearing these words, a vein started to stick out from Peter’s head, one of his hands opened wide, straightening his fingers, and he began to walk forward.

Seeing this, Sil attempted to use his telekinesis power to slow down Peter, and it worked, but Peter pushed through with his strength.

"Sil, let me go and give you the slap that you deserve, you spoiled brat!" Peter shouted, stepping through the force. It felt like he had an elephant that weighed several tons on his back, and it was attempting to drag him back, gritting his teeth, he continued to move forward. "You think people can’t change, especially kids? What about me!

"You must have known what I did to Quinn back then. According to you, I deserved to die as well! And I might agree with you, but I try everyday to make up for what I have done!" Peter shouted, moving forward again.

Now, Sil had no choice but to drop Zhen to the floor and use both hands to stop Peter back, who was now around two meters apart from him.

"General Peter is strong." Swin thought, knowing how much power Sil had to be using right now, and Peter was walking through even that.

’Sil, I know you’re upset, I know you want Vorden back, I know you’re angry, but don’t take it out on these students. Take it out on me! You think you’re the only one that doesn’t miss Vorden! He and Quinn were the only friends I had during school. I would do anything I could to bring him back right here, but I can’t!

"You doing any of this crap is helping no one and is only bringing more trouble to the people that are still here!" Peter said, finally raising his hand above his head, and moving it slowly down. Sil stood there still using his ability as Peter’s hand touched Sil’s face.

It was hardly a slap, as there was no speed giving no power into it, but it was the only thing Peter could do as his fingers brushed his cheek.

"Sil, stop it now!" Quinn said, having rushed in.

Everyone seeing General Hardy now arrive were relieved, but after hearing the rumours and witnessing Sil’s power, they were all still afraid.

Quinn looked at Peter, who was still, and the student on the floor. He couldn’t imagine what happened, but when he looked at Sil now, his face was full of tears.

’Did Sil do all of this? Did I make a mistake thinking that he was ready to be with other kids? I thought that bringing him to school would make him better, but it might have made him worse. I shouldn’t have forced him into a situation he didn’t want to be in. Part of this is my fault.’

"I’m sorry, Quinn, I don’t know why...." Sil managed to blurt out and finally dropped his hands.

In dropping his hands, the powers that were being used on Peter were finally free, and Peter could move again.

Everyone seeing Sil cry in place was wondering just what was going on. Was it all over? Or was he soon going to attempt to blast everyone in the room? No one dared make a move in a situation like this. It was just common sense.

Lifting his hand up again, Peter swung with a strong force and slapped Sil across the face, sending his body spinning a couple of times before he eventually fell to the floor and had passed out.

"I told you I would give you a slap!" Peter said. "The crisis has been stopped."
