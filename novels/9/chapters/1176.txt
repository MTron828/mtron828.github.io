Chapter 1177 Finally Returned

After listening to the content of the deal Shiro and the Demi-god tier beast had made, Quinn didn‚Äôt consider it to be as bad as the other had made it out to be. In a way, they might even be able to use this information to strike a deal with the humanoid King tier beast.

"Thank you for letting me know, and don‚Äôt stress yourself too much about it. I believe we can solve the situation. It just means that I might need to put in a special request to someone." Quinn replied with a smile, which calmed Shiro‚Äôs initial worries.

After all, if they were unable to complete the request, Shiro was sure that the beast would eventually end up rebelling, and then they would have to go through the same mess they had just been through all over again.

Soon, the others started to fall asleep one by one. Quinn noticed that every sixty minutes one soldier would open the door and check in on them. From the looks of discomfort, they seemed to belong to Sergeant Till. Fortunately, they appeared to have been instructed not to stir up any trouble, so after confirming that everyone was still inside they would quickly leave.

After nightfall, this patrol had changed to every two hours

As long as they came back within that time limit, preferably within one hour, in case they would come back earlier, there should be no problem. There was still some time before Quinn needed to leave, and he started to think back, back to when he had used the Inspect skill on the strange sword that belonged to Longblade.

After the Quest information had popped up, Quinn had taken a closer look at the sword details, yet he was unable to find anything too strange about it. The most prominent thing had been the marking on the sword of a singular large eye with wings.

Unfortunately, his system hadn‚Äôt revealed anything else. Still, it was the first real hint he had discovered. Another strange thing was that the system hadn‚Äôt even assigned the sword a tier ranking. Back when Longblade had gifted him the indestructible katana weapon, he had done so because he had claimed to have a weapon of a similar tier that suited him better.

Quinn was sure that he had been talking about this blade. Based on its strength and strong passive skill, Longblade must have assumed it to be of at least that tier. Its sharpness was definitely not worse than the indestructible katana.

‚ÄôI wonder if something would happen if I took the sword to that tablet. That is where I got the quest in the first place. Maybe the voice could give me some information on the sword. When using Inspect, it didn‚Äôt give me any information on what it‚Äôs ability was either, but it didn‚Äôt just stop qi, it also stopped me from producing my shadow as well.‚Äô

While having the sword temporarily in his position, Quinn had attempted to use his shadow powers on the weapon as well, but it had failed. It couldn‚Äôt even be stored in his dimensional space, it was as if the sword had the ability to negate everything, including Qi, abilities and perhaps even more.

Quinn slightly regretted having handed the blade back to its owner. Longblade had already given him a valuable gift, so it would have been strange to keep it. Still, once he was in a better state of mind, perhaps he would allow Quinn to borrow it, if he couldn‚Äôt provide him with more information on it, at last.

‚ÄôDamn, I‚Äôm going to be asking him for far too many favours at this rate if I ask for the sword as well. Maybe we can swap?‚Äô Quinn thought.

The last thing that Quinn had forgotten about was the quest reward, something he had received for defeating agent 2. He had received the usual level up, with a stat point but there was one addition to the skill that he didn;t expect.

[Your ability to store Qi has increased]

[The amount of Qi in your body has permanently increased]

It was strange but he could tell that the system had granted the request almost immediately. For the extra energy his body had felt from absorbing the crystals now felt a part of him. However, there still seemed to be an imbalance. It felt more like the extra energy for the crystals would have disappeared if it was not for the quest reward.

In the middle of his thoughts, another soldier came to check up on them, doing his best to not disturb anyone‚Äôs sleep, which was surprisingly considerate. They waited for the guard to come in and do his usual head check count, and when it was over, it was time for them to leave.

Raten in his beast body, Sil and lastly Shiro would accompany Quinn during his meeting with Logan.

Using shadow travel, everyone was able to hop in, and they could travel under the walls and head to their destination. The good thing was, with it being night time, it was next to impossible for anyone to spot the Shadow travel that would move across the ground.

They traveled at a fast pace through the Shelter walls, and when they were a distance away where they couldn‚Äôt be seen by the others, Quinn connected with Logan to check where he was. The other was located behind a mud hill in the west direction.

Since they couldn‚Äôt fall through the sinkholes it was easy enough to reach. Quinn imagined that Logan was able to cope with the tricky terrain as long as the beast with him was helping. Eventually Quinn spotted the mud like hill, it was far smaller than the one the shelter was placed on, but it was enough to give them cover, and when going around the hill, they could see Logan standing underneath it‚Äôs shade, with a dark coloured beast.

Popping out of the shadow, all of them came out at once, with Quinn at the front in case the humanoid beast would suddenly attack. Sil was also staying close to Shiro. After what he had learned, there was always the chance that Raten could be taken control of and they would be suffering from a pincer-like attack.

"Um it‚Äôs nice for everyone to meet, I guess?" Quinn awkwardly said, staring at the other humanoid beast.

"Are these the comrades that you spoke of?" The King tier beast asked Logan as he sniffed. "They seem to be human... for the most part."

It was clear that there was a lot of explaining ahead of them, but Quinn was glad that the beast hadn‚Äôt outright been hostile at their appearance. Before any of them could speak up, the Demi-god tier beast stepped forward. Just from the way it walked, Quinn could tell that the one in charge was no longer Raten.

The humanoid beast then leant forward to the side of the king tiers ear, and the two of them stood aside, conversing in hushed tones, to prevent the ‚Äôhumans‚Äô to listen in.

However, they were unaware just how good Quinn‚Äôs hearing was. He noted with interest that the two of them were actually conversing in the human language. When thinking about it, it made sense since the way normal beasts communicated shouldn‚Äôt be too suited to explain more complicated things and it wasn‚Äôt exactly a language, they were too primitive for that.

Since they both had learnt this language they could talk to each other more freely. As for what they were talking about, it was the special deal that Shiro had made with the Demi-god tier beast. It seemed like Shiro had also already explained that they had another friend that they wished to save and needed the body of another humanoid beast.

After hearing everything from someone it trusted, the King tier beast looked over at Quinn.

"I understand that you are the leader of all these people here?" It addressed Quinn, who merely nodded. "If you can really fulfill that promise, then I shall agree to host someone else in my body for as long as you need to. The lives of too many have already been sacrificed in hopes of us stopping the humans."

"It is clear to me that even if we grow strong enough to fend off the ones already here, more of your kind will just come in. They will just send more and stronger reinforcements to capture or kill us. If you have the power to break the cycle then I ask you to do so. In return for helping us you will have our bodies."

"If I do not, then you are free to have your bodies back." Quinn answered immediately.

With the agreement between them all having been made. It was time to get to work. Shiro stood there placing his hand on Sil‚Äôs and the King tier beasts head. It was silent for a while. Until one person started to complain about who had come back.

"Wait a second. Did that beast just agree on the spot, so they don‚Äôt have to have a massive fight, risking their life in that dreaded place?! What sort of bullshit is this!" Raten complained. Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

In the middle of his complaints, Shiro was doing his part, and looking at the beast‚Äôs eyes, they were no longer as fierce as before, instead they started to water up slowly.

"It‚Äôs been a long time since I last saw you."

"Welcome back, Vorden. It‚Äôs good to see you again."
