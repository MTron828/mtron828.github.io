Chapter 1246 - Unwelcome Face

All of the Blade's knew what Sil had said to Hilston before he had decided to finish him off in the way he had done. The video that had been recorded was watched by them all multiple times, not just by them but nearly everyone in the Shelter.

The drones had advanced technology that was able to pick up clear audio in a specific direction despite neither one of them not having microphones on their bodies. During the fight, Sil didn't exactly whisper the words to Hilston in his fit of anger either.

It was then that Sil had claimed that he didn't care about the reason Hilston had done everything, that no matter what, it wouldn't make up for the crimes he had committed, but after the fight, something had changed. It had to have for Sil to suddenly ask this question to his brother and sister.

This was due to the people around him, and not just any people, but those in the Cursed faction.

He wasn't lying when he said he wanted Hilston to be the end of his journey, of his saga. Now that he was gone, there was no reason to worry about what that man did or was ever going to do. However, walking back through the Shelter, there were those that hailed the Blade family as heroes, congratulating them. They were the ones that had defeated the five spike that no one else could, while at the same time, some harboured anger towards them.

Some of the Cursed members that Sil would walk past every day on the Cursed ship, were shaking when they would see him now. Hiding from his view while speaking whispers. It was clear they were scared of him.

Why were they scared of him? Sil started to think, and eventually, he had come up with his own answer.

It was the blood running through his veins, the Blade bloodline, the powerful ability that no one else could match up to. This family was the one that had attacked the Cursed faction, and what if it was to happen again.

After asking the question, there was silence from Vicky and Pai. This was what allowed the time for Sil to have these thoughts. He was thinking back to those that were shaking at the sight of him, so Sil spoke again.

"I‚Ä¶I just want to make sure that I don't turn out like him. I'm scared. I'm scared of this power. I'm scared of my body and all that training that we did. We all share his blood, don't we? What if there is something inside us that makes us become like him?" Sil asked, both of his hands shaking.

There was for a moment when he was fighting that he allowed the anger to consume him. It wasn't the first time he had this feeling which was why he was so concerned. He didn't want to admit it. Holding that much power gave a special feeling, something one couldn't explain.

"Haha, are you an idiot!" Raten burst out laughing. "Look at all of us, all of us carry the same blood, and every single one of us is different? We are all individual people regardless of what blood we have, and I mean, we're in freaking beast bodies at the moment. I'm not even sure if I have a spec of that dirty old man's blood in the first place. You are still a little child." Raten continued to laugh.

"I think what Raten is trying to say is, you really don't have to worry about that," Vorden added. "Just because of who our parents are, doesn't define who we are. You have a right to worry though because I too would like to know just what was that man doing, what was he trying to do."

Now, Vorden and Sil were waiting for an answer from the other two.

"Alright, would you two just stop looking at me like that?" Vicky said, scratching her head irritated. "Look, you aren't going to like what I have to say, but I don't have a clue either. When we joined the castle, all we did was follow what Hilston told us to do, just like you guys. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

"From time to time, he would tell us to go places. All we did was fight, Honestly if you want to know more, then the one you really should be asking is our so called mother and father. They would have a better answer, but I have no clue where they have gone just like you."

It was disappointing for them to hear. Their curiosity was now consuming them. Their whole life they lived, there had to be some sort of goal, right? Otherwise, the lives of their brothers and sisters were lost for nothing.

"I do know one thing." Pai interrupted, and from the looks of it, Vicky was surprised to hear this as well. "I just heard the old man mumbling once, but the reason why he puts us through extreme measures again and again, why he keeps making as many Blade children as possible. Maybe this is linked.

"I don't know what his goal was or why he was doing it, but he was looking for a Blade, one that could use a soul weapon."

All of their eyes lit up hearing this, apart from Borden, who didn't have a clue what was going on and was finding it hard to keep track. Still, he was interested to learn of his brother's crazy family origins.

They were all surprised because they knew that Blade's were unable to have soul weapons. They had all tried to summon it at one point, and it failed. They thought that it might be due to how their ability worked, that it was just impossible for them to have a soul weapon. If they even had one, they would have no clue what it would be.

"Why would he be looking for a Blade with a soul weapon? I mean, I understand if he was someone who cared about the family, but I don't see how it benefits him at all." Vorden said. It certainly was a head scratcher, but they would just have to ask their mother and father to find out the missing pieces.

All of the communicators they had on them, given by Logan, started to vibrate again, signalling it was time for them to use their muscles and such to get back to work. Heading back inside the Cursed ship, Vorden looked at Sil from behind.

'Hilston was obsessed with getting Sil back. I thought it might have been due to him being able to hold six abilities, but what if it was because of a different reason? Is it true, can Sil really use a soul weapon? If so, it would be a big help to the war. Perhaps Sil is someone who can go even beyond Hilston, and we are going to need people like that if we are going to face more five Spike Dalki. The problem is, can Sil handle that much responsibility? Although he is the same age as us, he has been mentally hit since a young age.

'Only now has it started to get better, but as long as I and Raten stay by his side, we can keep him in control. Sil, we will look after you and make sure you stay on the right path, and if we aren't there, then I know Quinn will.'

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Speaking off Quinn, he was now finally ready to leave the office. He had been sulking around for long enough about the penalty. In the end, it wasn't something he couldn't deal with. A loss of an item was something he could always get back, and his stats could improve.

His powers, Qi, skills he had learnt and experience, all of it was still there. Putting his plan into motion, Quinn had called Sam and asked him if he could require that all of those in the Shelter donate blood.

Quinn didn't quite explain the reason but said that he needed it for himself. The other vampires didn't get stronger by consuming different types of blood. This was something unique to Quinn, so it was hard to explain.

Luckily, it seemed like Sam believed that this wouldn't be too hard of a request.

'I can mix the blood into flasks and take them at the same time. My Qi has increased since the last time as well, and by mixing the two carefully together, I can make sure that the blood lust doesn't go out of control. It might take a while, but my stats will be back to what they were.'

Any second now, Sach and the others would arrive, and Quinn needed to be ready with a plan and what to do next. After all, even with the penalty, he was still one of the main powerhouses, and the Demon amulet could be put to good use.

Swinging the door open, Quinn was ready for a smile, but immediately, someone was standing on the other end of the door. His smile had disappeared.

"What the hell are you doing here?" Quinn asked.

"What a kind welcome, and here I thought you would be embracing me with a big hug. Did you miss me?" Richard Eno asked.
