Chapter 1278 - Planned Or Not?

The light from the tablet started to dye down, and Layla could finally see Quinn removing his hand from the tablet. She expected Quinn to look half defeated as so far he had been. Especially based on the faces she had seen him pull while his hand was on the tablet, but instead, she saw a smile on his face.

'Did he find the answer he was looking for?' Layla wondered. Seeing Quinn's smile gave a warm feeling in Layla's heart as well.

'My emotions, they are all over the place. Is it because of the subclass?' Her vampire subclass caused her emotions to be more heightened than usual.

She had experienced this before, sadness, anger, and happiness. All of these emotions would be multiplied compared to before she was turned. But it was also what allowed her to evolve into her other forms. The stronger the emotion, the more strength she had. .

On top of this, she also noticed that the sword she had given to Quinn was no longer rattling. When she was next to the tablet, Layla had attempted to touch it herself. While holding the sword, there was no such effect for her.

'You are a special one, aren't you?' Layla thought, and before she knew it, Quinn was directly in front of her, handing the sword back over.

"I didn't really find out much about the sword", Quinn said. "Just that it used to belong to someone else a long time ago. It looks like you can keep on using it with no worries. Speaking of, have you ever heard of anyone named Bliss?" Quinn asked.

He knew it was a long shot, but Layla and the others did live a life before him, and there was a time when she was at Pure for a good while. Perhaps she had met this person at some point, but soon seeing her shake her head, Quinn realised that this wasn't going to be an easy task.

"Maybe the Divine being?" Quinn asked again, referring to the name the system had given her rather than the one Ray had. Still, Layla shook her head. G√™tt the latest chùíÇpters on nùíê/velbin(.)com

Layla found it a bit strange that Quinn was looking for someone after touching the tablet, and she wanted to ask why. Still, he seemed to be in deep thought.

He was thinking about how to complete the next part of the quest. While also a little annoyed that he hadn't received anything for finding out about his Talen family bloodline.

'Is it because I received another quest straight after? Maybe this is like a chain, and I won't get the real reward until I complete the whole thing.' Quinn wondered. More importantly, he needed to figure out how to find this person.

Although Ray said there was a chance she would come to him, why hadn't she done so far? Everyone knew who he was. The Blade's could get to him, so he was sure if someone was looking for him, they would have been able to find him.

"You know, if you're looking for someone, maybe she should ask Logan," Layla suggested. "He has access to military files and more information than we can imagine. I would guess he could find whoever you are looking for, but with just a first name like Bliss, I don't know how much it would help."

It was a good suggestion to make, and Quinn certainly would ask Logan, but he had a feeling it wouldn't work either.

'I have never heard of this Bliss character either.' Vincent said. 'But you have to remember. The person in the tablet said he had lived 1000 years ago. If this is a friend of his, or someone that knew him, then maybe many don't know who this person is.

'However, there are those that have also lived for 1000 of years that might know the answer, and one of them is on this very island.'

'Please.' Quinn almost begged Vincent, hoping that he wasn't suggesting what he was suggesting. After his mood had just picked up again, was he really telling him to see if Eno knew who Bliss or the Divine being was?

'Alright‚Ä¶ I guess I can't help it, and I need to talk to him at some point anyway.' Quinn sighed. 'Even if our views or morals are different, our goals are the same for now.'

"Layla, I just wanted to say thanks for being by my side this whole time. Why don't you meet up with Sam, catch up on whatever plans he has at the moment, and then come back to me? There's something else I need to do." Quinn said.

Not wanting to waste any more time, Quinn ran off, heading towards the castle's direction. Judging by the fact that Quinn was heading that way and not speaking to Sam himself, Layla could tell who he was going to talk to.

'I just hope nothing happens between the two of them.' Layla thought, making her way towards the castle herself.

‚Äî‚Äî

It didn't take long with Quinn's speed to find Eno, and it wasn't hard to find him since he had remained at the same place Quinn had last seen him, on top of the castle. His back was facing away from Quinn while Brock was looking towards him.

He knew that Eno knew Quinn was there, yet still didn't turn around, and seeing the red blood armour, Quinn had many thoughts running through his head.

'The blood armour, Eno had it all this time, and the other vampires didn't even know about it. I guess this is someone who even tricked Arthur, someone who he allowed to call him friends even knowing what he did.

'I also can't help but think that this isn't the only thing that Eno is hiding.' Quinn thought.

What stood out to Quinn as well was the crown-like figure on his head. He hadn't seen that before, not even on Arthurs set, and he was sure it wasn't just for show.

"I hope you haven't come back here to give me a lecture because if so, you are better off continuing what you were doing before", Eno replied.

From the castle, Eno had a clear view of what Quinn was doing, and perhaps he had even figured out what was happening, but Quinn knew that he couldn't hear the conversation he had just had. Otherwise he would understand why he was here.

"I wanted to ask you something, something about-'

Just as Quinn was about to ask his question, he saw Brock turn around and look the other way. Quinn also stopped mid-speech because he could hear it as well. He quickly ran to the edge of the castle wall and looked out far in the distance, where the vast blue sea could be seen.

Large giant circles were opening all over the place. They looked similar to the portals that everyone used, but there was no device to activate them. Seemingly they had just opened up out of thin air over the ocean floating there. Not just one but around twenty or so.

The real worry was that they weren't small portals for humans either, and before they knew it. Several spaceships, around ten from each portal, had come through the teleporters. There were so many ships that Quinn couldn't keep count of them, and they were now all moving towards the Blade island.

What stood out about them was they didn't look like Dalki ships.

"How many‚Ä¶‚Ä¶how many have they sent to this island?" Quinn said.

"I had a feeling he would go all out," Eno said, looking out still unmoving, but his fist was tense.

"Jim, why do this much?' Vincent thought.

Those in the castle weren't the only ones that had reacted to this. Unexpectedly, even though the ships had yet to reach the island. The Demon tier beast finally looked like it had decided to wake up.

Its heavy feet hit the ground, shaking it slightly as it stood upright, then looking to the sky, it opened its mouth wide before letting out an almighty roar.

Beasts in the trees and birds flew out, scared of staying on the island, and everyone who didn't know what was going on, now knew something was happening.

The roar was so loud that Quinn had covered his ears, and when the sound had calmed, he looked over at the beast.

'No‚Ä¶no, no no!' Quinn thought.

Looking at the teleporter, Quinn could see that it had been smashed into small pieces. He didn't know when, but he could see the giant Dragon's tail moving back and forth next to it, but still a little distance away. He could only imagine it had collided with the teleporter near the tablet.

"That was not what I expected. The beast has never gotten within a certain range of the tablet before, so I thought it was safe even from the Demon tier beast." Eno said. "However, it just means that there is no retreat for any of us. If we want to survive this, then we have to fight all out. With our lives on the line."

There was something inside Quinn that believed, after hearing those words, that the teleporter being destroyed wasn't accidental at all. Eno wanted to end it here, whether the Cursed faction wanted to or not.
