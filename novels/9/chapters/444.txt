Chapter 445: The new tenth?

In a mind of his own, Quinn was busy thinking about what he had just said. The last name was repeatedly playing in his head as if a record player was stuck. Now, all of the times he had seen the name "Eno" before were starting to appear in his head, and there was one time in particular he was thinking about.

When looking at the teleporter in Logan‚Äôs room. The system had stated that it was created by the inventor Richard Eno. This name was known far and wide on earth. This was because he was a well-known inventor that had created things such as the teleporters as well as how to incorporate beast crystals into making weapons among other things that improved the daily life on earth.

He was one of the major players in turning the tide of the war. After finding out about the teleporter in Logan‚Äôs room and how it was found by his parents and had been passed down from generation after generation, of course Quinn had his suspicions that there was a possibility that Richard was a vampire.

It was impossible for a regular human to live that long.

But when the name was freely spoken, not once did the system nor Fex talk as if they knew the person they were talking about. Quinn had assumed it was an alias. Using the inspect skill on the teleporter, it had come up with the name Richard Eno. Perhaps it really wasn‚Äôt an alias, but then what relation did it have to the AI‚Äôs family the tenth. Were they even related at all?

Or was it such an ancient name that even the Ai, and Fex didn‚Äôt know about it.

If they were related then once again the system had chosen to hide something great. However, Quinn didn‚Äôt have much time to think about this, for there was the matter at hand, as an old looking aged vampire was staring at him with teary eyes.

The old man who had gone by the name of Edward was starting to get emotional hearing the name of his leader being spoken. Still, he didn‚Äôt let it get to him as he quickly wiped away his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt.

[Rank Vampire Noble]

[Former Vampire knight of the tenth family]

It looked as if Edward was a vampire noble, the same evolution as Quinn. However, there was also a bit more information, stating that he used to be a vampire Knight. The same rank as Silver and Clark.

If he was to remember correctly, Vampire knights were selected by the leaders. They would select the strongest vampire Nobles to fill this position, and there were only allowed two per family. The current status was possibly due to the former tenth leader disappearing.

Thinking about all this, it reminded Quinn of his own quest, where he was to select two vampires of his own to become a vampire knights. What he was more impressed with though, was how strong Edward was.

Even though Quinn hadn‚Äôt used his all during their confrontation from earlier. With only that, he could tell Edward was stronger than Clark. Perhaps even amongst the vampire knights there were those that were stronger and weaker. Which was starting to make Quinn rethink his position of strength when comparing himself to them.

The role didn‚Äôt necessarily have to go to someone strong, but being trustworthy also played a big part when selecting someone.

Looking at Edwards‚Äô face, the happiness had gone away and now he had a more distinguished serious look. "I will not be played for as a fool!" He shouted. "There are many that know the tenth‚Äôs name. You will have to do more than that to trick me. If you really do know Vincent, or someone has sent you, then you will have to prove it."

There was a slight pause in Quinn‚Äôs response as he conversed with the system on what to say, after a back and forth he was finally ready to answer.

"When you were only 23 years of age, you confessed to Ashley Young. This resulted in a rejection, however it was not just once, but three times." Quinn replied. To this, Edwards‚Äô face started to go bright red with embarrassment. ÔøΩÔøΩNot only that, but there is a scar on your right backside, for when she rejected you a third time, you claimed you wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. To this she responded with a strike and a cut was made. If I‚Äôm not mistaken to this day you have refused to allow your body to heal it up. Also, you then went on to confess to..."

"Stop! Stop! Stop! Please no more!!!" Edward shouted and pleaded. "I believe you know, Vincent. Although why he would share those personal things with you is beyond me. If he is still alive, I shall beat him down to his grave once again." He said as he stomped his foot on the ground multiple times.

It was the first time Quinn had seen such an uncomposed and free vampire. Usually the others would make sure to keep up some type of image.

After releasing his anger out on the floor, Edward had many questions he wanted to ask.

"So how is he, is he still alive? Did he ever fulfil his wish?" Although Edward had asked these questions, Quinn had no clue about the answers were himself. Even after waiting a while, it seemed like the system wasn‚Äôt giving him the answers either.

"I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know much, I was just told to come here and ask you for help?" Quinn replied. "What exactly happened here?"

If Quinn wasn‚Äôt going to get an answer from the system, then maybe he could get something out of the old man in front of him.

Edward was unsure of what was going on, the person in front of him was surely sent by Vincent, yet he knew nothing. Looking at the two kids again, he realised they really must have been young.

"I suppose I already know the answer to what happened to him." Edward said as he let out a big sigh. "Please follow me."

The three of them started to walk up the staircase and started to walk through halls as they headed towards the throne room. While doing so, Edward explained.

"When he left, Vincent never relinquished his seat, and the flame continued to burn brightly. Before, there were many that thought he would return to us one day, and the Flame was our hope. However, soon the lights had turned off, and the flame was gone.

"With that, so was our hope of a leader ever coming back to us. The flame going out like that could only mean one thing, he had died. With no successor or no one to pass on, we thought the flame would never be lit."

"The most likely scenario was for a new family to be created. The ritual to be completed and a new bloodline to be formed. However politics as usual seemed to get in the way and in the end the Tenth and their people were left in a limbo state... forgotten."

"Until recently, news of the flame in the main castle being lit again had spread. Perhaps the tenth leader had never died, or a successor had come back. When I saw the lights in the castle light up. I thought the lord had returned. I‚Äôm sorry... it‚Äôs the reason I lashed out at you two. I was expecting to see the lord and when I saw two kids instead, I overreacted to the situation without letting you explain."

The tenth leader had left, now it made sense why the place was rundown, unlike the other castles. However, it still didn‚Äôt explain how Quinn‚Äôs parents had managed to get the book. If the tenth leader was the creator of the book and Quinn had accidentally become the successor when opening it, why did they have it?

And why did the tenth leader decide to leave his people? Was it such an important matter?

Eventually they had reached the throne room, which looked quite empty compared to the rest of the castle. It wasn‚Äôt a usual throne room, though. The room was located at the very top of the castle, but unlike the others, on the opposite end of where the chair where a wall would usually be. There was just a very large pane of glass.

Looking out, one was able to see the view of the entire city and all of the people down below. "It‚Äôs beautiful." Quinn said looking out.

"This was the lord‚Äôs favourite spot. He would often stare out that window, looking out at everyone. I remember when he had that specially made, he wanted to have eyes on everything going on at all times. He truly did care for us all. Unlike what the other families think."

Quinn continued to look out the window. When staring and looking at all the people down below, he felt different somehow. He started to imagine himself as the lord of a castle like this. How if all those people down below were his responsibility? If they relied on him to lead them and the weight of that feeling.

He couldn‚Äôt tell if he liked it or not. Perhaps if he was faced with so many people‚Äôs worries, he would have chosen to run away as well. But then he started to think of why he was here in the first place. To save Fex. If everyone down below was another Fex, perhaps even he would do everything in his power to protect them.

"Erm!" Edward said, clearing his throat, wanting to move forward with their conversation. "Sorry to interrupt, but there is an important question I have to ask. Due to the flame being lit. It is now known to everyone there is a new leader. If Vincent or this new leader has sent you here. Then I can only assume you know who it is, or where they are?"

Quinn waited a while before answering, and eventually the system had finally spoken. Who had remained silent since they had initially entered the castle.

"If we wish for him to help us, then we need to tell him everything. Inform him that you are the new tenth leader." The system said.

Not sure what reaction he would get, but thinking about saving Fex, he did as told.

"I have been sent here, because I am the tenth leader." Quinn said.
