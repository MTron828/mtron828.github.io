"Sorry, did you just say Quinn?" Valnar, one of the community leaders asked. "Are you saying that girl is Quinn's daughter?" 

With the vampires' hearing, it seemed like Xox wasn't the only one that had overheard the two talking. 

"Ah, yes, she is amazing isn't she?" Jessica said with a smile. 

"Of course, no wonder she is impressive, to have a father like that." Valnar added. "It is a shame though that we won't be seeing Quinn at this event. Is there a reason why he was unable to be here?" 

Both Jessica and Andy looked at each other, they didn't really know how to answer, and Muka and Xander had gone off somewhere in order to keep things flowing for the event. They were partly the host, so they had to mingle with others as well as everyone else. 

"There was a recent incident at the vampire settlement I heard." Valnar said. "Could it have something to do with that?" 

"Yes." Andy nervously replied. "As you know, there were vampires that had a lot of trouble, but the issue has been resolved. Still, Quinn is busy trying to resolve that issue even more!"

What Andy said didn't make sense at all, to put it simply he was an incredibly bad liar. 

"He resolved the issue… but he is away because of the issue?" Valnar said. 

"Actually, I heard a few things myself." Fenkelm said. "I talked to a few of the vampires here about what had happened. It looked as if some of the vampires were possessed. I wasn't able to get much, but they said a name was being used quite a lot… I think it was Immortui."

Xox's heart started to thump louder. Of all the things he had heard, he never thought he would hear that name. With Xox being the busy body he was, he knew a lot about Immortui as well. 

'Wait a second, he solved the problem but has gone away to solve the problem?' Xox thought in his head. 'It can't be. Was Immortui causing chaos in the vampire settlement, and although the issue was resolved here, Quinn must have gone to deal with the issue first hand… has he gone to where Immortui is?'

It was a guess, but it was the best guess he had at the moment. 

"They are just rumours!" Andy said, his voice going a little high pitched. "Quinn is just busy on other planets helping them with their issues. He is a good person who cares for the vampires and the entire universe, a hero after all!" Andy started to laugh. 

Trying to change the subject, Jessica tried her best to interject and save him. 

"Minny is certainly impressive, just like her father, but you know it's not because she is Quinn's daughter." 

"What do you mean?" Valnar asked. 

"Many think that Minny is strong, fast, and powerful because of who her father is, and although she might have had an influence from him, the two are not blood related. I think it's important that we note that Minny's achievements are because of her own amazing self." 

The vampires looked at the little vampire with awe as they saw her head back. They had to admit, they were passing it off as a simple blood relation, but now knowing that was the case, her achievements were even more impressive compared to before.

More matches and games had continued on, while Xox was sitting there thinking what was the best thing he could do, the best way he could get more information. The information he had was just a theory, it was a good theory though, because he believed it linked to the reason why the Ancient Ones would be so concerned with Quinn's actions.

He would stay until he learned more for now. As time went on though, it looked like there would be no chance during the event, because it was nearing the time for the final event. The match face off. 

In the crowd itself, many were congratulating Minny, and they wanted to ask her a few things, such as how she was feeling about the last event, but there were just too many people who wanted her attention. 

Both Tobi and Abby had to do their best to fend the people off, until finally it was her turn to head out. She jumped for the arena down to the ground, and started to walk towards the centre of the field. 

The other schools soon noticed who had come out, they recognized her well since her last performance was extremely memorable in their heads. 

"No way, are they sending a lower grader out there to fight? I mean, I know she's fast, but what about blood aura, and blood control!" The vampires said. 

"Maybe the vampire settlement just has no one that's better than her. I guess they're a little weaker since the war and stuff." 

The students had their own opinions, but it was quite different from what the teacher's believed. From the Vampire Corps and from the Graylash planets, they found it strange that the last event, the main event, that a participant was able to participate from any grade. 

Naturally, the higher grade vampires were stronger. Now to see this, they thought something was up. 

"Tazzy, you have to be careful of her, don't let your guard down just because she's younger than you." A teenage boy vampire, with short sides and spikey hair in the centre, walked toward the arena. 

From the Vampire Corps unit, there was another female vampire with hair so long that it was just a few inches from touching the floor. 

The battlefield was an open area, on a metal ground. The attacks wouldn't quite reach the stage, or at least that was the idea anyway due to the sheer size of the whole field. 

Everyone was cheering as a large countdown appeared above on a screen for them all to see.

3…2….1

Immediately, Tazzy had his eyes set on Minny.

"Huh, where did she go?" 

Already in the air, right by the boy's side, she had a fist full of red aura. It was unleashed and hit him right in the side of the head, causing him to skid across the floor, sliding almost until he had hit the side of the stand. 

A blood aura swipe was sent out from the other contestant. Minny turned around and ran forward again, her claws filled with blood aura swiping through it, she broke the blood aura, then leapt up kicking the female in the chest making her fall to the ground. 

By the time the vampire realised what happened, they could see Minny with a blood aura claw pointed right toward her neck.  DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Two seconds, maybe three seconds, and the grand event that was to finish it off, had come to an end. 

"What… What happened? Did you see that, wait, how… just how… how can a vampire be that strong?"

Seeing this, Layla thought it was a bit unfair, afterall, Minny was stronger than most vampire leader's, but Muka insisted that Minny take part, to show them her strength and that she did. 

'I guess I should tell MInny to hold back a little in the future.' 

"Your sister did good, didn't she?" Layla asked, as she looked at the seat to her right, but once again, Galen had disappeared, he was no longer in the seat. 

"Hey… why is there a toddler out on the field." A student was heard saying. 

Turning around, she could see Galen was out on the field. He had escaped her once again before she even noticed. Layla was ready to run out and snatch Galen up but she hesitated for a moment. 

There were many times in the bedroom where Layla had attempted to catch Galen but it was impossible, if she went out there now, everyone would see an embarrassing moment of Layla attempting to grab Galen as he disappeared everywhere, and for now they were keeping the fact he had shadow powers a secret. 

'Maybe I should just leave it to Minny to bring him back.' 

"Sister!" Galen shouted from the other side. 

Minny turned around, letting the other girl head back to her school as she turned to look at her brother. 

"Galen what are you doing here, go back to mom!" She shouted. 

However, Galen shook his head. 

"Sister is strong, let's play, fight me!" Galen said.
