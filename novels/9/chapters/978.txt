Chapter 979 - The return of the king

After using the inspect skill on the pieces of rubble, Quinn had gained three new shadow skills in the system. He wondered if the entirety of the walls was present, and hadn’t been destroyed if he would have been able to extract more information from the room.

Perhaps the system only gave him the skills it could figure out from what was there.

’Some large pieces are missing from the wall. Did Arthur take them with him so they couldn’t rebuild it back together like me and Kazz was doing? Which means the other pieces of the shadow might be with Arthur, but why didn’t he just put all the pieces of the walls into his dimensional storage?’ Some things certainly didn’t make sense, and there was always the chance that it wasn’t Arthur as well, but who else could enter the fourteenth castle and would know about all these secrets.

Looking at Kazz she was frustrated. She was still trying to put pieces together but some of it was just small pieces of dust. She wasn’t paying attention to him, but Quinn wasn’t going to try any of the skills out, right now. He would do so in his own time, away from the prying eyes of others.

’I’ve learnt that I never know who will be my enemy in the future.’ Quinn thought.

When Kazz finally gave up, the two of them decided to leave the rooms and Quinn also closed the door to the room behind them. Making sure it was locked up as well.

’If I was able to learn a few things from what pieces were present, if they did put it back together then maybe they could find something out as well.’

Having searched every area of the castle now, and Quinn knew this due to the new map of the castle he had obtained, it was time for him to return back to the school. His work was complete, and he would have to try to figure out another way he could teach the others the shadow.

’Could we smash it up and take the crystals, maybe we can use it to create something. It’s a bit of a waste just having it as a chair.’

’I think you should leave things as they are in the castle.’ Vincent said. ’In the first place having blood crystals is considered a crime.’

’So you don’t think that now Bryce knows about it due to Kazz, he won’t take the crystals and claim it for himself?’ Quinn asked, and to this Vincent didn’t have an answer

’I believe the throne is somehow linked to the castle and the system. Destroying the chair could very well get rid of your title.’ Vincent argued.

Now this was something, Quinn didn’t want to happen. He looked at the door ahead, and looked at the lock on it. Looking at the lock behind him, he figured that Muka wouldn’t have known the combination to the hidden room, since it was kept a secret, but maybe there was something he could do with the other one.

Walking up to the door, Quinn placed his hand on it, and soon had a smile. Now he was the leader of the castle, Quinn could open all locks, but not just that, he could also change the combinations on them, and he decided to do this very thing.

A cl.i.c.k.i.n.g sound was heard, but none of the parts needed to be moved, so Kazz wasn’t too suspicious about what he had done.

As long as they didn’t have the shadow ability, or the combination to the lock it would keep them out. And even if they did try to attack, now as the owner, Quinn was sure the system would warn him like it had done so in the past.

However, Quinn didn’t want to rely on the system. He was afraid that there might be times in the future where it wouldn’t warn him. Then it would only be his own fault. Maybe one day the system would completely disappear just as easily as it appeared. For now, he would use the advantages it would come with, but try not to rely on it.

Before leaving, Kazz looked at the red crystal throne one more time. She couldn’t stop glancing at it, and thanks to her being distracted. His actions with the door didn’t seem weird.

"Come on, let’s go!" Quinn shouted. "I think you might be the one who becomes possessed by it in a second if you keep looking at it like that!"

Running over to where Quinn was, the two of them entered his shadow and started to go through each of the floors heading down to the very last one.

Now, no longer needing to search each room they were able to go out of the castle far quicker than before, and once they were out, they appeared in the fourteenth inner area. Quinn cancelled his skill, and the two of them popped out, walking on the surface once more.

"So will you be reporting back to Bryce now? Is there anything I need to do or can I just go back?" Quinn asked.

Kazz waited a few seconds before replying and now Quinn was sure of it. Everything that was happening, everything that had been seen in the fourteenth castle was communicated back to Bryce. Through Jill, the two didn’t need to be close, and it seemed even now she was asking him what he wanted to do.

"You are free to go back, if there is any trouble we can get in touch with you, and we will keep your Knight, Paul, informed and updated." Kazz answered.

Just as the two of them were about to part ways, a strange black smog in the air was heading towards them. It moved as if it was alive, searching for something and once it found what it was looking for, it latched on to a destination and headed straight towards the two of them.

’That smog looks the same as when the Boneclaw is summoned?’ Quinn thought. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

And sure enough, when the smog had reached an area around fifteen meters away from Quinn, it descended to the ground and the fog started to form into the Boneclaw it was. It stood there with its long dangling arms and its giant body.

"Hey, isn’t that your familiar? What’s it doing coming here now?" Kazz thought.

However, Quinn didn’t know either, why didn’t the bone claw just attach itself to him like it would do in the past. Was something wrong?

The Boneclaw then lifted one of its long dangling fingers that was like a claw and pointed straight towards Quinn.

"You..." A deep voice said. "Prove...yourself."

Quinn wasn’t really sure what was happening and it seemed like Kazz had a better idea, as she quickly extended her nails and moved away.

"Quinn, get ready, don’t you see what’s happening!" She shouted. "The Boneclaw, it doesn’t think you are worthy enough to be its master anymore. It’s challenging you to a fight to the death."

Quinn had heard the stories about familiars, and how they would rather die than work for a weak master, and if the situation came to be they would try to kill their master. However, Quinn was much stronger now, than when the Boneclaw had first found him, so why would it attempt to do this?

A little dazed as to how this situation came to be, soon the system had given him the answers he was looking for.

[The Boneclaw has regained its lost strength]

[It no longer believes you are fit to be its master]

[Prove yourself and win back the Boneclaw’s trust]

The last thing Quinn had expected was a fight with his own familiar. Something that had saved his life a couple of times in the past, but now it was trying to kill him.

"I guess I have no choice." Quinn said, as he activated the shadow and it rose behind his back.
