Chapter 840: A true talent

It was a good thing the two of them had been sitting down when Quinn had started to share his knowledge in that regard with Leo, unaware just how much stronger it would make his Vampire knight in the near future.

Quinn started from the beginning, when he himself had learned about the different stages of Qi from a man named Abdul. How the rankings within Pure worked and how they were taught Qi. However, not everyone was on the same level, and there were three stages of it.

"You said you fought against someone at Pure before?" Quinn confirmed. "And that they used Qi as well? So it looks like your hunch was right. Someone is indeed teaching those in Pure about Qi, yet when you were taught it, your master did so without mentioning these different stages?"

Shaking his head, Leo had no such knowledge.

"I taught you everything my master taught me without holding back. Even the Qi strikes I use with my sword were developed by myself."

Although Leo didn’t say it, he had always wondered about something. At the dojo, he had always felt like his teacher had been holding back something. Leo understood why his master might have not taught him the other forms of Qi after their little incident, but that didn’t explain why he hadn’t done so before. He had lived and stayed with him for years always being stuck at the same level.

"I see," Quinn replied. "When we were on the hunt for the demon tier beast, I met a man called Chris. Similar to Layla’s mother they both knew the three stages of Qi. I’m sure he was a member of Pure, especially based on what the others said at the time. You told me that your master has gone missing, so I was wondering if the two of them could have been the same person? He was the strongest Qi user i have ever met so far."

Quinn tried to describe his outer appearance and even imitated Chris’s actions, but eventually Leo told him to stop.

"No matter how much you try to pretend to be him, I can’t confirm it without seeing his Aura. Still, based on what you’ve told me about his personality, he doesn’t sound like my master. Even when I was young my master was about my age now, so he should be an old man by now. He might have already died, so perhaps Chris was just another student of his, one he passed down everything to."

Thinking about this, Leo was wondering why though. He had so many questions. If his master was the one behind Pure, why did he create that organisation? Surely his enemy should have been the Dalki that killed all those people, or at the very least blamed Leo for making the world aware of their existence.

The second thing that was troubling him was whether or not his master knew about the other stages of Qi during their time together, or whether it was something he had only learnt after their separation. If he knew about them beforehand, then why didn’t he teach it to Leo?

"I thought this information might become useful for you. I remember you saying that Qi was a passed down secret, so I found it strange that those in Pure knew it, but it seems I have given you a lot to think about, and at a time when we can’t even leave this place. I’m sorry."

"Don’t worry about that young boy," Leo replied. "More than anything what you have given me is time which I did not have before. Time to figure out this whole mess, and I quite like the students here.’ He said with a soft smile.

Seeing this, Quinn thought that the role of a teacher suited Leo quite well.

"Say, when did you start teaching them Qi?" Quinn asked.

"How did you know?’ Leo was surprised by this.

"Ever since learning the second stage, I have had more control and can sense it a bit better. Still, I noticed that their energy is incredibly weak. Is there a reason for that?"

Leo let out a big sigh before answering.

"I did try teaching them, but unlike Erin or you it seems like their body is just not that compatible with it. After learning how it could disrupt the vampire’s energy I thought it could help them, if the other vampires attempted to attack us again. However, that was also the case when learning Qi. Trying to gather up any energy in their body is a painful process for them. There is no harmony and the energy tries to attack them from within."

"It was just like Chris told me." Quinn replied. "When teaching me Qi, he had told me that the energy in my body is taken up by the vampire energy, and if it wasn’t there, my Qi would have been more powerful, but my body has been able to balance the two out. Maybe it’s because the three of us were humans before being turned?"

After the conversation, Quinn stood up and went over to Leo’s side.

"This is a little awkward." Quinn said, scratching his head. He then quickly bowed to Leo out of respect. "If you will allow me too, I wish to teach you the second stage of Qi. I know that you are my teacher so it would be rude of me to say this, but I want to return the favour. If you don’t want to accept help I completely understand."

Standing up, Leo lifted Quinn up from his bowing position.

"You can’t be doing that anymore, you are now a family leader. If the others saw you bowing down to one that should be bowing to you, it would cause quite the fuss, and Quinn. Having a student surpass you is an achievement in my eyes. Maybe some people get scared or worried but not me. I will be happy to accept your guidance."

The relationship between the two was a close one. Even though they hardly spoke, Leo had always been a teacher they could rely on. He hadn’t told anyone about Quinn’s secret in the military academy, and he had helped him in many tough situations, yet now Quinn could finally help Leo after all the help he had received.

The two of them headed down to the training room, and just like Chris had done, Quinn would do the same guiding Leo, while explaining what the second stage actually did.

"I’m sorry if I’m not good at explaining, but I hope you’ll understand what I’m getting at. If you don’t understand then I can try again, and show you." Quinn offered, feeling a little nervous. When teaching the others how to use the shadow ability he hadn’t felt this way, but in front of Leo it was different.

"Don’t worry." Leo said, as he walked away disconnecting from Quinn’s hand on his back. He then drew his sword, and flung it down to his side.

Quinn was left there stunned. Chris had praised him for being a fast learner, yet it had taken him several days to get the hang of it. As for Leo... someone who had no knowledge of it before, only had to be shown once, before he was able to use the second stage Qi, covering it with his sword. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"This feels good." Leo smiled after giving it a few more swings. He then proceeded to strike out, extending the Qi beyond his swords taking the air even further. A scratch mark was left across the floor even though his sword hadn’t touched the ground.

’How is he even better than me at it?’ Quinn questioned.

’Finally! For once take a look at someone who has true talent, someone even better than yourself!’ Vincent triumphantly cried out, bitter that Quinn always seemed to surpass him in many ways. ’It’s people like him that should be the main character in stories!’

After swinging his blade for a short while, Leo stopped.

"It’s a shame you didn’t learn much about the third stage Qi, but I will try to improve this for now."

"I guess I need to start learning from you again." Quinn sighed in defeat.
