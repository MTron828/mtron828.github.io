With Calva being one of the champions and inhabitants of the red space, he was naturally strong. Each champion's strength was different as it played to their strong parts. One factor about all of them was their physical strength. 

Their bodies, in terms of endurance, speed, and power, were all at the highest levels. They truly felt that they weren't lesser than anyone out there. This was also true for Calva's case. 

He was stronger and faster than any Skully and had power to compete with the demon kings. One of his natural traits was the special bone he could produce from his body. An almost unlimited supply, and at the same time, it was harder, and could be made sharper than any of the Skullys. 

Even an amateur, if they were to grab a bone sword made from Calva's body, could cut a diamond, and even the hard red crystals of the Durum race. Yet right now, his opponent had grabbed his spear like it was nothing. 

'When I went up against Immortui, I was unable to hit him, but he never grabbed my thrown spear like that, especially when being distracted by others.' 

The Durum demon's continued to fire their red crystals toward Quinn, and as if he was completely focused on Calva now, he allowed them to hit his body. They would pierce the white skin, but only ever so slightly, creating just a scratch before falling off onto the ground. 

Before the crystal even fell off, the small scratches were healing on Quinn's body. From the outside watching, it looked like a series of bullets were just bouncing off his body.

A flick of the wrist, that was all Calva had seen, and the spear was sent right back directly at him. He had managed to move his arm shield just in time, hoping to deflect the attack. Yet the spear had pierced right through it. 

'This is the one time where I wished I didn't make my own weapons so sharp!' Calva thought. He had grabbed the tail end of the back of the spear. His whole body was being pushed back and he was gripping hard with all his might. 

The tip of the spear had already broken through the bones on his chest and was going further and further inside. Focusing, Calva started to grow the bones inside his body. Trying to squash the tip of the spear before it would go in any further, and finally he had stopped the spear.

"How can the demon Quinn be so strong!" Ekeke said, one of the Skullys that had first met Quinn. "Weren't the champions, ones who had taken Immortui close to the edge? So then how is this demon playing with them all!"

The story of the champions was just what was spread throughout the land. Even in the stories there were many differences depending on who one went to about what happened. Due to the large scale of the battle, there weren't many that saw it in person, just like this battle right now. 

And there was always the chance, the chance of lies being spread about the champions, because they didn't want the inhabitants to lose hope.

Using the hardening bones in his body, Calva pushed the spear out of his body until it dropped to the floor. Thankfully, due to his unique skill, he was unhurt by the spear, even though it pierced through his skin. 

Lifting his head, panic started to set in. 

'Where is he, where did he go!'

A wave of blood aura hit him right in the face. Quinn had crashed on the ground with a wave of energy emitting from his body as he had done so. All of the nearby demons that were still alive had been knocked back off their feet. It wasn't an attack or anything like that, just the energy that was being emitted from his body.

The demons were quick to get up from the floor, and if their diamond shards were not going to work, then they would just have to get physical. A group of around fifty of them all charged in towards Quinn. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Seemingly he stood there doing nothing. The blood from the dead rose up. It hovered in the air, creating moon shaped blood slices. They all moved at once. The demons felt like nothing had hit them at all, until their bodies had been cleanly sliced into several pieces. 

The demons had no clue what had hit them, they had just been killed in an instant, without being able to put up a fight at all. As the pieces lay there on the floor. The pool of blood was spreading out. The blood from the dead was touching each other until it covered the entire floor in the area. 

The blood was moving in an unnatural way, and it soon started to spread out. After seeing what had happened to the rest of the demons they didn't want to move in any more, they didn't want to attack what was in front of them. 

Little did they know, it was too late, the pool of blood spread out, covering their feet and falling into the holes that were made by all the Durum demons. The blood in the entire area shot up, slicing right through each and every one of them. 

The blood from the pool underneath had hardened. The blood was shaped like sharpened trees, and on the end of them were demons. It was a forest of the dead that had been made on the spot and by a single human person. 

Calva knew at that point, there wasn't a single thing he could do. That was until the smile on Quinn's face started to fade. Immediately both hands grabbed onto his face and he fell to his knees. 

His upper body was swinging wildly as if something was fighting inside of him. The wings started to retract into the body, and the shadow that covered the body as if it was part of the skin, started to disappear as well. 

"ARGHHH!" Quinn screamed and more of the surrounding aura had spread out, including a large amount of blood, not blood aura, had come out from his mouth erupting like a volcano. It fell on top of Quinn's body. 

With the blood falling off from Quinn's body they were able to see a clear person. He was relatively small compared to what he was before, regular human flesh could be seen through the blood, curly hair, along with a lost expression that was just looking at his hands.

"Is… he back… is Quinn back!" Anon said. He wanted to run out there and check, but after seeing what had just happened to the Skullys and the Demons his own legs were stopping him from doing so. 

Calva being the closest had to make a decision, and as he was walking he had a thought in his head. 

'While he's like this now… and not in that form from before, is it better to just kill him, or try to use him in some way?'
