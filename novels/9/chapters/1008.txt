Chapter 1009 - Something in the air

The destination had been set for Quinn and his students to leave. He had been given a map and was to guide them to a certain area, on the map one could also see the other areas and the other users with a map as well. Some of the other areas were fairly close, with the borders touching. Quinn was a little worried that this might cause some trouble, but this would always be the case with how many classes were hunting on the same planet.

It was vastly different to before when Quinn had to do his assessment. In the past, one would have to do everything on their own. From researching the best areas for hunting, to gathering the map themselves.

He had learnt a lot form those days, but it looked like the military were fast tracking things with the new students and being extra cautious. Once researching the area, Quinn was then to start a device that would time them. Then, the students in his class in groups of five, were free to hunt.

"Hey, won’t this be a little unfair?" Shiro complained. "I mean, what happens if there’s just more beasts in the other area."

"The other teachers have assured me that they have attempted to make this as fair as possible." Quinn replied. "However, I do have to admit, that its nearly impossible to make it entirely fair. Take this as a lesson Shiro, nothing in life is completely fair."

The students got to work, and were fighting basic tier beasts, some of them were frightened of the beasts unable to preform well. Just like before, the class were currently going against the sand worm, who were a similar size to regular humans but had razor sharp teeth spiraling on their insides when they opened their mouths.

What surprised the students was the fact that they fared better then they had expected. Even when scared, they were able to dodge the oncoming attacks, and using their weapons they were able to tackle the beasts with ease.

’Looks like they are using Qi quite well.’ Quinn said, as he felt a bit relaxed compared to his up tightness from before.

’I have to say, I am quite surprised as well.’ Vincent added. ’The Qi that you have taught them isn’t so noticeable when they are fighting. I suppose when you used it, it had more of an explosive effect due to combining it with your blood powers, but with the kids, unless they were to physical show off there superhuman feats, it doesn’t stand out too much while giving them an edge at the same time.’

’Yes.’ Quinn replied. ’We can actually thank Shiro for that, I noticed it after his fight, that no one really seemed to notice his change so much. Students and others are used to seeing incredible humans due to the beast gear, and beast gear isn’t always visible on the outside.

’Of course, this would be different if I was to attempt to teach them the second stage of Qi, but there is no need for that. At the same time, I feel if they are relying on Qi then it means that they will no longer focus on their abilities when they need to.’

Shiro, Venus and Swin were doing well using a combination of their abilities. Venus was using his ability to lure our the Sandwomrs while Shiro would then pluck them into the air, lastly the one that would attack them was Shiro with his duel blades. The other two students in their group, would be protecting the ability users.

Swin and Venus could also use weapons if need be when they were in trouble.

While Quinn was in the middle of watching this, he had heard a massive scream come from his left side. In an instant he had appeared by where the screaming student was, and could see that a worm had latched onto a female student’s arm. Quinn quickly with his b.a.r.e hand dismembered half of the Worm’s body, then grabbing onto the other half, he used his second stage of Qi to create a very thin layer around where it’s teeth would be. It was like one was putting a thick piece of cloth under the teeth. Now Quinn could safely pull it off and cursed the worm with his b.a.r.e hands.

"Are you okay?" Quinn asked. He could then see that the worm was unable to pierce through the students armor, the girl was completely fine but she had just screamed from fear.

However, what Quinn didn’t realize, was that he had just gone from one side of the hunting area, to another in an instant.

"Hey, wasn’t general Hardy on the other side of the hunting area just now, how did he get here so fast?"

"I don’t know maybe he ran, or he was actually closer then we thought."

"No, I’m sure he was just with Shiro and there group, and there literally on the other side."

Hearing these comments, Quinn just noticed what he had done.

’Damn, I guess I’m still worried about the students. My own experience from last time is effecting me.’

Quinn wasn’t relaxed at all, this place had brought a lot of bad memories for him, and he just couldn’t shake the felling that something was going to happen.

Over where Fex was at, be decided to enter the bar anyway. Inside the place was dimly lit and there were tables with stools placed all over. It was meant to be designed similar to the bars around a thousand years ago.

The people inside all looked to be middle aged men, with a few females here and there. However, he wasn’t in the happy mood he was expecting to be, instead Fex was on guard. For the smell form earlier was coming from this very bar.

Fex looked around, but he mostly let his nose lead him, and that’s when he found himself at a table with two dark red sofas either side. A man wearing a type of cowboy hat could be seen covering most of his face, and he had a drink in front of him.

"Before I would have probably dragged you from the bar, and taken you back to the vampire world myself." Fex said. "But the new me is going to ask what exactly you are doing here. There are a lot of human students on this planet and as a teacher if your going to cause trouble, I can’t just turn a blind eye."

The man took a swing from his drink, and then placed the glass down, he then lifted his hat a bit so he could have a look at the youngster opposite him.

"You seem quite strong, for someone so young, but if you think you could drag me out of this place, you would have to be dreaming." The vampire stranger replied, then he took off his cowboy looking hat and placed it off to the side.

It was a vampire with a twirling gray mustache and long gray hair in a ponytail could be seen.

Seeing the vampire clearly, Fex didn’t recognize him at all, and it was blatant by the look on his face. The man then lifted up two fingers.

"It looks like either the vampires no longer teach about me no more, or you aren’t one to study." The man said.

"I was never the studying type at school, but I can tell by your smell your just a regular vampire." Fex said. "Now, I’ll ask you again, what are you doing here, or do I have to take you back myself?"

The man picked up the glass one more time and took a swig until it was empty, then with the glass he slammed it on top of Fex’s hand that was placed on the table.

The glass had crushed Fex hand showing the man wasn’t messing around. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

"Very well, why don’t you teach me a lesson. I wanted to get an idea of how strong the new generation are anyway."
