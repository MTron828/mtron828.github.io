Quinn had done exactly as Lexor had thought, he had allowed for one of the Durum demons to escape. Since all of this was meant to be some type of grand event, then clearly it meant they had to return somewhere, especially if they felt like they were in trouble.

Doing this, one of the clones decided to follow behind and eventually reached the base. The clone was in the centre of all of the Durum demons, close to two hundred of them in total.

'The real Quinn will make his way here, he can follow my location and it shouldn't take him long. In the meantime, it looks like there are quite a few demons that look slightly different from the regular ones I have taken out so far.

'This will be a good test to see just how strong they are.'

Immediately, as the demons saw the threat in the centre, many of them started to point their hands out. The red shards on their back would vibrate slightly, and then out from the palm of their hand, the red crystals all fired out.

Since it was coming from multiple demons, it looked like shards of red crystal were raining horizontally towards Quinn.

'I have 50 percent the power of the original Quinn‚Ä¶ but I can do everything he can, and that includes using the shadow.' Clone Quinn thought. 'Let's test if any of these guys can get through!'

Swiping his foot, a wall of shadow was left on the ground and quickly rose right behind him. The shards of red crystal all hit the shadow bit by bit, staying still and hovering in place.

All of the attacks had been blocked, while some of the shards were fired out far away, hitting the side of the shadow and swinging in slightly.

Some of the shards were coming towards Lexor, who had to quickly turn around. The shards clashed against his red crystal back, and fell to the floor.

"You idiots, be careful when you're fighting in such a large group, you can easily hurt each other!" Lexor shouted.

It was a quick realisation, they had never fought together like this before. Even when battling a large group they had mostly fought individuals and right now, the Durum demons were acting the same way, they were fighting as if they were taking part in a hunt, and all were rushing to defeat the intruder.

When the shadow fell, so did the crystals. There were a few ways Quinn had learned to use the shadow. Either when it hit the shadow it would slow down time, and when removing the shadow, the momentum would continue forward at the speed it was shot at.

He could also open up shadow elsewhere and allow for the attack to go through the shadow as if it was teleporting. Then there was just moving the shadow in the way and blocking attacks. This would be a more condensed form of the shadow.

When the shadow fell to the ground though, the demons had no clue where the intruder was, it was as if he had disappeared. Coming up through the ground, with his gauntlets fired up with red aura, Quinn slashed through two of the demons.

It struggled a little as his clawed hands were going through the hard crystal backs, but was able to break right through, killing them on the spot, their blood flowing onto the floor.

"He's here!" One of the demons shouted, and charged in, his whole hand had been crystallised and had turned into a sharp object like a sword.

'While I'm a clone, even a small attack, as long as it hits me, can cause my body to disappear, so right now it's best if I don't get hit.'

With clone Quinn's hand glowing red, he fired out a blood cannon, full of his aura, hitting the demon right in the stomach, sending him up in the air, flying off a great distance. Another tried to leap on top of him, but with his boots he was able to kick up the air, and now was looking down at them all.

As a clone, there were certain skills of the armour that wouldn't work, especially any of the active skills, but with the air walk and silent steps, they still worked even on the clones.

'Their bodies are hard, at my current strength this might not be enough, but let's give it a go.'

From above, with his eyes glowing red, hundreds of swords were being formed, but the demons wouldn't allow him to do this, especially Lexor, as he attacked Quinn in the air above. T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

However, the shadow raised, and went in front to block the attack. When seeing this though, Lexor moved his hand, and in doing so it looked like the crystal swirled and moved around aiming right for Quinn's chest.

Just in time, the shadow had moved quick enough covering his chest and blocking the attack.

'It looks like that one is a little more skillful compared to the others, but the best thing to do right now is get rid of as many of them as possible.'

The swords began swinging down from the sky, and now it was his turn for a large-scale attack. Some of the demons decided to try and attack the blood swords, but as their crystals hit the swords, they did next to nothing.

While others decided to turtle up. They pulled their legs and arms in, with their face towards the ground and allowed for their red hard crystal backs to face the sky.

Those that hadn't done this, the swords pierced through their bodies, several of them, but the backs of the others were strong enough to block the swords, but not without a few of the crystals on the back cracking or breaking off.

Eventually, the swords raining down had come to an end, and now the ground was a completely different sight compared to what it was before.

'That's good, it looks like I managed to get rid of at least half of them.' The clone thought.

Looking at the ground from above, that was when the clone Quinn had seen something, it was a horrid sight. It was the mountain, the mountain of dead corpses, the heads of the Skullys as well as the dead beasts.

'They have a mountain of the dead piled up like it's some sort of achievement. I guess those that are working for Immortui, have next to no compassion just like him. I won't have to feel bad at all about getting rid of them.'

There were a few that had just been injured rather than killed, so lowering himself to the ground, he had planned to finish them off. Going up to the first one, Quinn had his gauntlets encased in the red aura again, and he could see the demon moving toward him.

He leaned back avoiding a strike, and as he did he smashed right through one's head. He continued as he went toward the next one again, this time the demon didn't move quick enough, and Quinn had already killed another.

Then, once again, another demon had only been injured with the sword going through its thigh, it made a desperate attempt as it lept towards Quinn, and shot out several shards towards him.

Moving from side to side he was able to avoid them all. With his hand building up a blood cannon, the clone was going to deal with it from far range, until it felt something go right through its chest.

It was a crystallised red hand.

'Damn it‚Ä¶ this body‚Ä¶ is so weak‚Ä¶' Turning his head, the clone looked and noticed that it was the demon that was more crystallised then the others and had a bigger back.

'I knew this one was more troublesome than the others, maybe I should have gotten rid of him first.'

Lexor felt like he had the perfect hit, he had been waiting for the perfect time and moment and he had successfully landed a killing strike. The next moment though, and his target had puffed into nothing but clouds.

When the smoke cleared up, Lexor could see that there was no one in front of him.

"Is he dead?" Lexor thought, turning his head left and right, wondering if he had escaped, but he was unable to see any sign of him, other than the fact that their attack had halted, but now they were now less than a hundred of them.

"He has to be dead, I stabbed him right through the heart." Lexor said to himself. "Still, I can't believe it, how could one person cause all of this damage. This has never happened before.

"At least, we dealt with the problem now‚Ä¶ and it wasn't any worse."

Lexor had no idea, because at that moment, just outside of the camp, Anon and a particular person had arrived.
