Chapter 967 - Logan the real superpower

On the Cursed Ship, Sam was doing his daily duties, reading the reports sent in from all the different planets they now owned. Sorting of the beast crystals, allocating trade, seeing what was made and he even had to decide who in the Cursed faction would get what equipment first.

Since the attack on the forgery that happened on the Cursed ship last time, he had told those in the forgery to make equipment for themselves first. They needed something just in case of an emergency. Even though Alex could now use the shadow ability, it wasn’t enough and they needed to be careful.

So strangely at the moment, there were some of those in the forgery with legendary tier armour.

Sam continued to look through all the reports, which was done at the command centre. He liked working here because it was where one could see the vast space out from the glass window.

That’s when he noticed that he had received an additional report compared to usual, and it had come from someone who he didn’t typically get reports from.

"This one was sent from Logan, was there anything I asked him to send me?" He wondered. He was pretty sure he would have remembered if he had.

Although Sam was mostly in charge of the Cursed faction, the leaders themselves were pretty much free to do what they wanted, and they did so with a few helping him here and there. Wevil, Nate, Linda, Dennis and Megan were the ones that helped out the most.

Opening up the report, it took Sam a second, before he thought his head was going to explode, he couldn’t quite believe what he was reading and he needed an explanation immediately.

A short while later, Sam and Logan were sitting opposite each other and Logan had just given a full explanation to him about what happened, and what exactly the report was about.

"So, you’re telling me, Quinn told you to buy out all these manufacturing plants. You essentially sent me the details of the whole company!" Sam said, still not understanding to the full extent of what he was being told.

"I just did what I was asked. There was trouble that was giving Quinn a headache. I thought the easiest way to get rid of that trouble, without putting up a fight, was to buy the company. Anyway, I have my own things to do so I can’t really do much with it. That’s why I have handed it over to you. Rather than be owned by the Green family, I want it to be owned by the Cursed faction." Logan explained.

Having looked through the report, Sam was able to see the contracts the company had on top of who their biggest client was, which was the military. In the past, The Cursed didn’t actually do much trading with the military, and they were more focused on trading beast gear and crystals with other factions on different planets.

’I guess this could be our link to the military? All the employees are still there, it looks like just the directors and executives were the ones that were let go. It should be doable and will benefit us a lot. The mechs were handy when we fought against the Sunshield family as well for those that are weak, and they are great for construction.’ Too many ideas were feeding into Sam’s head at once as he realised how good of a thing this was for their faction, it just meant there was extra work to be done.

"How much did this cost?" Sam couldn’t help but ask.

"Don’t worry about that." Logan replied. "It’s all my money. Remember my parents have passed away and I’m an only child. I also don’t plan to have any children in the future, so the money needs to be spent somehow. If it’s to help Quinn and those in the Cursed then I will have deemed it a good cause." Logan said.

It wasn’t like the Cursed faction were poor. Ever since taking over the Daisy faction, and with Sam creating a good system they now had quite a bit of good stable income. Even then, if they had no credits as long as they had beast crystals that could be used, they could do something.

But thinking about the Green family’s influence on everything, it made him think. Was it possible if Logan wanted to, could he take down the whole of the military’s systems? In a way, the Green family had always been a powerhouse just not fighting wise.

’I guess that’s why they never did, they kept a neutral relationship with each of the families, helping everyone and for the sake of humanity. It meant all groups were protecting the Green family, but now, there was a clear bias for who they worked for. Perhaps this may cause a problem in the future.’

Seeing that Sam no longer had anything to say about the subject, Logan decided to change the subject.

"Did you manage to send my request to Paul?" Logan asked.

This was something that Sam wasn’t too sure was a good idea.

"I did, ’’ Sam said. "Whenever you want to come over, he will be happy to escort you to where you want to go, and then you are free to be sent back. He just informed the King about what you are doing, but it seems like everything will be okay."

"Good, this robotic arm is good, but I realised that it isn’t the best, but I will use this opportunity to make something better than what I had before." Logan replied, swinging his robotic arm about.

"And how are your other projects going?" Sam asked. "When you talked to Quinn did you inform him of what you wanted to do? I know it’s not really my place to stop you, but I will have to tell him."

There were two things that Logan was mostly focused on while on the Cursed ship. The first task was looking for any Demon tier beasts on the planets that they currently owned. They realised after finding out that some planets had an inner planet, that the device sometimes would have to be used in different places to get a fuller and more accurate reading if there was a Demon tier beast on that planet.

If they found one, then they would inform Quinn immediately, and Quinn temporarily would stop his duties as teacher to see what they should do about the Demon tier beast. After witnessing Hilston’s power and knowing he was still out there, this was the quickest way to get stronger, but was also the most risky possibly taking most of their lives.

As for the second reason...

"I’m thinking about it, I’m not quite sure, and still trying to see if there is another way, but it’s the only clue I have." Logan said while walking away.

What Logan was referring to, was the Blade island itself. No one knew if the Hilston family had returned to their island after what had happened, but in a way they were related to Logan’s goal. Wanting to fulfill his parents request, he wanted to find Richard Eno, but there were no clues about him anywhere, apart from one.

Trying to search for clues if Brock had left that place or anything else was almost impossible, even with his vast network, and ’borrowing’ others’ networks using his powers he was able to find nothing.

The only clue he had left was to go to the Blade island itself, and this was what Sam was referring to earlier.

At the same time, there were also others planning to make their move soon as well. Leo, Erin and Layla often met up with each other, for more things than one.

Layla using all of her knowledge of Pure had pinpointed all the bases on other planets she knew of. As she actually didn’t know where or what the main base was located on.

Their search for Pure members and the Pure organisations had to start somewhere, and soon they would be going out on their first expedition.

Having just finished a meeting with the other two, Layla had gone to a quiet part of the training room; tired, panting and sweating. She had also been training with them as well.

While she rested up against the wall, she kept thinking of one person in particular.

’Quinn, I wonder how you’re dealing with being a teacher?’ Layla thought. ’Honestly, I wanted to come with you like the good old times, but I have my own questions as well. Why did my mother decide to create Pure in the first place? Why did she hate ability users? Surely one of the founders knows? I thought she never cared about me, but in the end that wasn’t true at all.’

Footsteps were heard coming towards her, and blonde hair flickered in front of her face.

"Come on, it’s time we get moving, it looks like Leo is ready as well."

From behind, Leo stood up, who was in a sitting position the whole time, and he had a smile on his face.

"The third stage of Qi is a brilliant thing, I should inform Quinn about it once we are done." Leo said.
