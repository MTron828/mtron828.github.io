Quinn wasn't letting up with his new form. He continued to travel through his shadow while swinging his arms, firing away all different types of energy punches.

The energy punches had the same strength as if Quinn was to directly hit with his own fist, but it was affecting Ray in more ways than one.

Ray was able to deflect and break most of the energy fists with his own power as he punched them directly head on.

When hitting the Qi filled type punch though, it would scatter into multiple particles of energy rather than get rid of it and the hit would continue on hitting his armour and parts of his face.

One of the energy fists that was thrown out by Quinn and had directly hit Ray was a Blood Forest fist.

Similar to the effects of the blood bullet, when the fists managed to hit Ray the blood particles started to spread on the armour. The effects of Ray's power were strong though and most of the armour was able to disintegrate the blood.

But with the sheer amount of Blood Forest fists hitting Ray and the size of them being a lot bigger, the effects managed to work out.

Small particles of the blood hardened stabbing into the skin of Ray.

[Beast Blood has been absorbed through Blood Forest punch.]

[No effects have been added]

The blood forest bullet and punch allowed Quinn to absorb blood through their hits. One of the advantages of this when fighting the Dalki was the strength and healing properties he would get from the hit.

Ray was currently using the body of the demon tier beast that created the Dalki. However the demon tier DNA had been mixed with humans to create a substitute that allowed the vampires to gain more strength through their blood.

This wasn't the case if they were just a beast, vampires gained next to nothing consuming beast Blood and it seemed to be the same case here.

Thanks to Alex mixing in the blood celestial guns there were more variations of the Asura blood form fists.

He kept nearly all of the different types of bullets as fists now instead, including the blood Fairy bullet, as well as others but all of these were useless against Ray.

Apart from one more type of fist and that was the shadow fist. Although nearly all uses of the shadow seemed to disappear when Quinn got close to Ray this wasn't the case for the shadow fist.

In the first place, Quinn was using the skill from far away so he could gather the shadow just fine. The other thing was, just like the bullet, this was a condensed form of the shadow.

So unlike his shadow it took a bit longer for Ray's powers to take effect and influence him. When hit with the shadow punch Ray could feel something a little strange.

His senses dulled a little, his hearing, his eyesight, sense of smell even. Eventually his power would evaporate the shadow punch but it was still affecting him.

It was because of all of these things, all of these rapid punches and effects building up on Ray, that he was having such a difficult time dealing with them all.

"Screw you, do you think these levels of attacks will ever be able to beat me?" Ray shouted.

Both of Ray's hands were covered in his orange aura creating the swords. They covered both of his hands and looked like blades at the end.

Swinging them, it slashed through each of the fists of energy.

'I've figured out the troublesome fists of attack, if I strike them down first and then ignore the rest...'

Ray did as he thought, striking down the fists that troubled him and then flew right towards the shadow portals. With a single stroke he ripped through the portal and before it could completely disappear, Ray was already going toward the next set of shadow portals.

Quinn, seeing what he was doing, continued to jump from his position and soon created three more clones through his boots' active skills.

The clones that were made had the same weapons as Quinn meaning all of them had six arms as well.

Every single one of them, from slightly different angles, started to throw out their fists.

The attacks from the clones were at fifty percent of his strength, but it was impossible for Ray to tell the difference between the real attacks and the fake ones.

While Ray sliced at the shadow portals with one dragon sword he opened his mouth up and, instead of the balls of fire, fired out a large content stream of flames.

It covered the whole sky to the point where a large shadow was cast underneath. Wasting no time Ray was seen flying right through his flames and heading straight towards Quinn.

Lifting up his gauntlet Quinn stopped one of the dragon sword strikes, it was powerful knocking his hand down, but his two clones by his side punched Ray on his chest, head, and body by its side.

This wasn't through the normal fists of energy but a direct hit. With the clones being close to Ray they were able to hammer at him with all six of their arms, throwing them constantly out.

Ray was getting hurt but by bearing the brunt of the force of the attack he swung his dragon sword cutting through one of the arms. A cloud of smoke puffed out.

Opening his mouth he fired out at another destroying it, and that one too had puffed into a cloud of smoke.

When Ray closed his mouth a fist had come out from the real Quinn slamming him on the side of his face.

Ray skidded across the floor and following up were several spears of blood that had been hurled at him.

Quinn also placed his hands on the floor and blood electric currents were being sent out right to where Ray was.

The ground electrified with red blood around where Ray was hitting him as hard as he could and the attacks still didn't let up as Quinn continued to throw out all of his fists toward Ray.

It hit him constantly, his armour glowing with power, pain could be seen over his face.

Reaching out he moved toward Quinn, jumping from one side to the next. A slash of the dragon sword came down and a blood arm was lifted.

It went right through the blood arm causing it to fall to the floor, but with Quinn's many limbs he was able to hit Ray right in the chin.

"I'm going to take you out right here!" Ray forced his head down with sheer will and threw a punch back on top of Quinn's head.

His knees buckled slightly but Quinn stood strong tackling Ray with two of his arms he grabbed him and his wings before slamming him into the ground and bashing him on top of his head with his other two arms.

It was a constant back and forth, and blood was spilling from each side's mouth, the shockwaves continued to vibrate through the whole planet as the power continued to increase to levels that the planet was unable to handle.

The two of them were now fighting in close quarter combat, for every move they needed to concentrate to avoid or strike back, and there were small movements in one place.ùëÖread latest chùíÇpters at n/ùíêv(e)lbiùíè(.)co/m

Neither one of them wanted to take a step back as they continued to pound into each other.

On the side though, Jim had been preparing something. The nest crystals all along his arms lit up and the power was combining in the palm of his hands.

"Both of them are hurt, there's no telling who will win this fight and that's just too much of a risk for me." Jim stated.

'using the power of this many crystals, it will be around two thirds of the amount I have, it will draw out all of their energy in one blast.

'It's a lot, nearly all the work I have built up over these years are in these crystals but to take them two out, it's worth it!'

The energy of a large number of nest crystals blasted out of Jim's hands and went out straight toward Quinn and Ray. The blast was so large it looked like it would consume the both of them.
