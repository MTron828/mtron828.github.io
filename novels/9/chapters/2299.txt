Using the device, Sil could feel his energy being drained. It was a painful procedure, but one that he bore as he bit down on his teeth.

A pulse was sent out from the device, at first, it spread out through the ship. All of those on board the Marpo Cruise started to feel a ringing pain in the back of their heads. A strong headache started to come over them, some even fell to their knees.

It wasn't just one or two experiencing this; everyone on board the ship was. The pulse continued to go out of the ship, past all the planets in the area. They were having the same experience as those on the Marpo Cruise.

This continued, reaching the other ship, changing back all of the memories of the vampires of what really happened. Although the pulse had gone out far, it was only in this area. They were far away from Earth or the beast planets; that would have to be changed another time.

The sphere opened up, and immediately Layla leapt up to pull Sil out from the machine and brought him back down to the ground.

"Is it all done?" Russ asked.

The group looked at the people that were attacking them not too long ago. They stood there, eyes open wide, confused. They looked at their hands shaking, dropping their weapons. Many fell to their knees.

"What have we done... what has happened?"

Some of them were heard speaking to themselves.

"It's done. I got rid of any altered memories, so now all of their memories are real ones they have experienced. Unfortunately, it also means they will remember everything they have done till this point. They will have to live with the sins they committed while doing someone else's bidding."

On the other planets, what Sil said was true. The fighting had immediately stopped. The explosions that were going off, the small skirmishes here and there, even Jake, who was in the middle of battle, everything had come back to him.

"Sh*t," Jake said to himself. "We were all tricked, and not even a little bit either."

Jake was fighting for the right side, but he felt guilty for forgetting everything Quinn had done and even thinking about going against him for a second.

For the others, they looked around at the dead bodies of the alien race that they had been attacking and their own allies. Some of the surviving Penswi, Amra, and Mermerials, as soon as they saw the humans stop attacking, they did as well.

For the humans, they looked at the injured, cut, and bruised aliens fighting with everything they had. Seconds ago, they saw them as the enemy, they were fighting to the death. Now everything was just replaced with guilt.

Nearly all the humans at that point got on their knees, faces full of tears, and started to beg for forgiveness.

"We're sorry... we're so sorry!"

For them, though, they didn't care about revenge. Instead, they were just happy that everything had worked. They had won the war and managed to survive.

Chris had stopped in his tracks. All of the strange thoughts he had moments before, now they made sense, and just like everyone else, he felt guilty for everything he did. There was an anger that rose in him that was unbearable.

"How... how could I work for such scum and do everything he said!"

What this also meant was that a certain man, who right now only had a head, had gotten his memories back. He could see his friend holding him, still crying uncontrollably.

"Hey, don't waste those tears on me," Peter commented. "Do you remember when I pushed you in that portal? After that, I risked my life trying to protect you from the Dalki. There was no way for me to come back, so you ended up turning me."

Of course, Quinn remembered. He would never forget a memory like this. 'Wait a second... if Peter is talking about this, doesn't this mean...'

"You ended up saving my life, even though I'd already thrown it away, and that's why I decided to dedicate this already thrown away life to you. So me helping you out again, I guess that finally makes us even."

Quinn was unable to speak; he was stunned for words. If Peter's memories were back, then it meant the other group was successful and most likely alive as well. With his shadow, he could still connect to Minny, so that was a big load off his mind.

Meanwhile, Ray too had received his memories back to what they originally were, and instantly he threw Jim right to the ground, just hard enough to cause his body to bounce and some of the bones in his back to crack.

"You tricked me!" Ray shouted, and his aura came out of his mouth, touching Jim. It started to burn the outside of his skin slowly. Parts of his flesh could be seen underneath.

Jim was screaming in pain but was unable to move due to the broken bone in his spine.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"I forgot to add another thing to the list before, I hate being used," Ray said as the heat continued to burn Jim. All of Ray's anger and aura alone were being directed toward Jim until he was no longer moving.

"Do you really think I don't remember what you told me about the nest crystals on your body?" Ray said to the dead Jim on the floor.

Soon, one of the crystals on his body started to light up. As it did, it was healing the skin on the outside, restoring the broken bones in his body.

"It may have looked like I wasn't listening to your rambling bullcrap, but I was paying attention the whole time. There was always something about you that rubbed me the wrong way, Ray."

Jim started to breathe again, but when he could see through his eyes, the sight of Ray and the anger coming from him, all of the cells in his body were shaking.

"Wait, we can change everything together, there's this thing, there's this thing the go-"

Jim started to reach for his neck, and he could feel blood seeping out of it. He didn't even see Ray's hands, but it had been used to slice right at his neck, killing him again. He fell to the floor.

"I'm going to enjoy this," Ray said. "Killing you over and over again until you no longer get up."

Ray was dead serious about it, and Quinn, taking a peek over, knew he had nothing to worry about. He had just fought against Ray. It was quite clear that he would have no problems making sure Jim was dead.

'I've already killed that guy a few times. I don't need to kill him more,' Quinn thought.

He stood up with Peter's head still in his hand. "Are you feeling weak at all? Is everything okay?"

"I'm feeling weak," Peter replied. "But I don't think I'm going to die. But I'm not so sure eating flesh will be able to bring my body back. We'll just have to work something out."

Ray continued to kill Jim in excruciating ways, the most painful ways he could imagine. He even held back his strength just so Jim would suffer more. Finally, only one nest crystal was left.

It seemed like a waste of nest crystals. Maybe they could have just ripped them from Jim's body and used them in other ways. But at the same time, allowing Jim to experience a different death multiple times seemed somewhat worth it.

For the last crystal, Ray chucked Jim's body in the air. Then, opening up his mouth, he let out a stream of flames, burning Jim's body. He continued to burn it until there was nothing left of Jim.

There was no crystal and no body to bring back. It was the end of Jim Eno.

Ray turned around and looked at Quinn. He didn't know what to say but wanted to comfort him and started to walk his way. In turn, Quinn smiled back.

But in the middle of the two of them, a beam of white light shot down from the sky, and standing there in its place was one Quinn didn't want to meet.

"Mundus..." Quinn said under his breath.
