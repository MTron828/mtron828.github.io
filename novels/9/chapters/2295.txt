Surprisingly, the information that Vincent had received from the clone, was the same as the information he had accessed from the database

The reason why Vincent had decided to make a stop here before going to see Malik, was because he thought that the clone might lie to him.

In some cases, because they knew there would be another clone that would replace them, with their same memories, they would just end their own life or not even care about it.

However, seeing Vincent, perhaps it had caused the clone to have some of its natural instincts come back.

All of the information that they could gather had been gathered from the system. Location of bases where the Marpo Cruise's were beign made, and even to the point where they ranked the number of Dalki's that had been made.

All of the information was being passed back to Logan, just in case anything would happen to Vincent.

What he had said before, it was true as well, most likely they would keep one clone alive, until they were sure they got every bit of information they needed.

To get rid of everything that Jim had created, whether the clone of JIm would be compliant or not they wouldn't know, but maybe with someone like Quinn using his influence skill they could force out all the information they needed.

While travelling around the Marpo Cruise, the clone of Jim didn't say a word. Even when there were chances for him to scream at the top of his lungs at those going past.

'Is he mulling over what he has done, after everything we said?'

Vincent was ready to act, to silence the clone but there was never any need. They had finally reached living quarters of all the vampires, and on a separate floor in the Marpo Cruise, that was where Malik was located.

One had to enter a lift, and to get to the floor where Malik was on, you needed special access, one that could only be accessed by Jim, and thankfully he had what he needed right here.

JIm's finger was used on the lift and it didn't take long for them to reach the floor where Malik was located. When the lift door opened they were met with another door, down a hallway.

Heading straight ahead, this one instead of a finger, required facial recognition to access.

"You really did a lot to keep this guy hidden huh?" Vincent commented. "How afraid were you that everyone would find out the truth. Are you still afraid even now, how everyone will feel anger after they learn that you forced them into a war for no reason."

"What‚Ä¶ what are you planning to do with Malik?" Jim asked.

The answer was obvious, although Vicnent didn't want to do it, he needed to get rid of Malik, so that way no one would ever use him in this way again.

Whether Malik was forced into this or not, it was his power that had caused all of this mess, and could easily be used again. Vincent just wondered, what if someone got their hands on the real Quinn instead.

They had managed to get their hands on Ray, but if they had changed the memories of Ray and Quinn, then perhaps there would be no one that could have stopped them.

Lifting up Jim's head, the door was heard unlocking. It slowly moved open using a heavy mechanism. The door was tightly sealed to the point where not even air could escape, and the right amount of oxygen was supplied to the room in a different way.

Entering the room, Vincent pressed a button closing the door behind him, while placing Jim on the side of the floor.

'I have no idea what is inside here, or what to expect, I might have to fight for my life.' Vincent thought.

The room they were in looked like a large apartment building. There were marble floors, high ceilings, a chandelier dangling from the top, a large open kitchen that could be seen to the left, and a living room to the right.

There was even a second floor and more to the apartment bulding. It was clear that Malik was living a life of luxury here.

Using his sharp ears, Vincent could hear the sound of footsteps coming from the corner. Blood aura gathered around both of his hands.

"Vincent‚Ä¶ and one of the Jim's." Malik was just in regular clothing standing there having taken a corner from his bedroom.

He wore no beast gear, and looked surprised to see the two, Seeing how defenseless Malik was, it was hard for Vincent to act, but he had to grit his teeth and bare it.

'I did a lot worse things in the past, there are a lot of sins that I have to bear. Adding one more to that list is not a problem.'

At least that's what Vincent thought, as he swung his arm, he released a blood swipe. Rather than going for his head or chest it went towards Malik's legs.

A deep cut was made, the blood aura had sliced through his knees causing him to fall to the ground. He fell on his back, and couldn't even feel hs legs, as blood poured out of him.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" Malik cried out. "I don't know what I did wrong but I'm sorry, please don't get rid of me."

Vincent was unable to get close to Malik for fear that he would have his own memories changed, he need to attack from afar. If he had hit his blood swipe on the neck, Malik would have died there and then.

From his observations, Malik was never anyone special.

He had never learned to fight properly or have any type of strong Qi. Even now Jim hadn't given him any beast gear to use, but Vincent had read his file and knew what had happened to him.

From a young age, he was abandoned by his family, he lived through the Dalki war being moved from place to place. Being treated as useless and abandoned by everyone he met.

He had eventually used his powers to create a better life for himself, creating a fake mother, a father, sister and brother. Changing their memories so he could live with them.

However, the real family members of those that he had changed, had caught on. They reported Malik, and his powers became known as well as his crimes and he was locked up.

He was meant to go on trial, but once again it felt like he was the one that had been forgotten about, as that day seemed to never come. Little did Malik know that the location he was at was being attacked by the Dalki.

Eventually it was the Dalki who found him, and Graham who had taken him in, most likely for his power. The problem was, it wasn't easy for them to force Malik to do his bidding.

They didn't have an infuence skill or abilities like Malik, and getting close would be dangerous.

For Malik, meeting Jim and Jack was a blessing to him. It was the first time he felt needed, felt like someone needed him, and because of that, he was happy to do whatever they asked of him.

Right now, seeing the Jim clone, and Vincent here and attacking him, he thought he must have done something wrong. All this time he had done everything they had asked, and never once had they been angry with him thinking of leaving him.

They provided him with a place to live, they gave him a nest crystal to prolong his life. Because they had a need for him, to use him forever and that was all that Malik ever wanted.

"You cruel b*stard!" Jim shouted.

"You should have killed him in one hit, why make him suffer."

Vincent, didn't want to, in pulling back at the last second he had made another mistake.

With a hand full of blood aura, Vincent stood to the side.

"You did nothing wrong Malik, you were pushed into this."

Vincent swung his arm and the blood swipe went right through his neck, killing him instantly. His body soon staretd to turn to dust, and left behind in Malik's place‚Ä¶ was a crystal.
