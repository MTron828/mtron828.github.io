Chapter 1110 - Everyone knows

At this time, Oscar’s message was being played for all of humanity to see. Wherever there was a faction base, a spaceship out far in the sticks, or even if you were currently in the school toilet. If one didn’t have a screen ready where they were, then one would appear from their watch, and if they didn’t even have that, then it was still impossible to miss the message since it was being played over intercoms everywhere.

’Why does he have to send out this message now of all times?’ Sam thought as soon as he heard the introduction. ’I was hoping for Quinn and the others to be gone by then, and I was going to explain everything to the faction myself in the meantime. Now it’s going to look like we were trying to hide it from our own people.’​​

Whether they liked it or not, they were about to be thrown into a rollercoaster of a situation and there was nothing they could do to stop it.

"As if the war with the Dalki was not enough of a problem, a certain group of people have decided to make use of this chaos for their own nefarious goals." Oscar continued. "This is an important message to everyone out there, as before we had believed that the Dalki were our only enemy, yet those people have actively allied with them! In a time like this we should have been able to unite and fight together for the sake of humanity!"

Although this message had already spread amongst those in the military and those fighting, the general public didn’t yet know about any of this, and it was already starting to worry them as they looked at each other.

"We have come to learn that these people aren’t exactly the same as us. They may look like us, act like us, use abilities like us and they have even been living peacefully amongst us for at least the last few years. We refer to these people as the ’V’. So far, we have only discovered a few things about them. At the moment, there does not seem to be a surefire way to tell them apart from us under normal circ.u.mstances, only when they use their powers. Their eyes start to glow red, allowing them to use a special red aura which grants them access to their weird powers."

With this information, people on the Cursed ship were starting to suspect something was up. Helen’s head immediately turned towards Quinn. It was no longer a secret that he had used certain red aura powers to fight off against the Dalki in the war.

"The reason why we are telling you all of this is because recently our own groups have suffered multiple attacks from people who they had been certain they could trust. Perhaps if they had known a bit more they would have been able to avoid the outcome that has happened so far. We want everyone to be wary as the V have a way to convert others into one of their ranks and some of them also seem to be able to control others actions to a certain degree."

"I understand that this news comes as a shock to everyone, but we have to stay strong, now more than ever, and all of you deserve to know the truth of who we are facing! Although it won’t work on every V, we know that some of them have a strong reaction to blood. If there is someone that you feel is suspicious or you don’t trust then I suggest a little test, but this is still not a sure way to deal with the problem."

"Lastly, I want to inform everyone that the V are not a unified force and have split into at least two groups. Just like they are those who have allied with the Dalki, the other group has come forward in their wish to help us in the fight against the Dalki! The latter group are those that are part of the Cursed faction. Their help so far has been enormous and they intend to use their extraordinary powers to continue to help us fight out there!"

"Please everyone, stay safe, and stay on guard!"

For a brief second, it felt like on the whole of the Cursed ship there was silence between everyone, and even where Quinn was there was no sound at all.

In the command room, Sam was banging his fist on the table.

"Oscar I understand your situation, but did you really have to do it like that?!" Sam shouted. "How is the human race supposed to stay calm when they don’t know who to trust? The way you explained it, the main finger and all questions will now be pointed towards us!"

Soon, talk started amongst those on the Cursed ship.

"Hey, you’re not a V, like what they said, right?" A member asked his buddy.

"No, I’m not, are you?" The other questioned back, only for the former to shake his head. "But didn’t he say that the Cursed faction had Vs? What do you think he meant by talking about blood, betrayal? This doesn’t make sense."

On the Cursed faction ship, the general consensus was confusion and for Quinn, he was left in a training room with all eyes on him.

"If I was to guess, V is just a codename that would stand for vampire." Helen stated her own thoughts on the matter. "Beings that react to blood, wield a strange red aura and have powers on top of their ability."

These statements were clearly being directed towards Quinn, and he could hear the heartbeats of all those who had not been turned, beating rapidly, a sign that they were frightened by this possibility.

"React to blood, what do they mean by that, and is the leader one of them?" One of the trainees whispered to another.

"Look at him standing there, he’s not saying anything to deny it, so he has to be one." Her friend whispered back.

"Shut up! All of you!" Nate ordered, as he went to stand by Quinn’s side. "So what if we are humans, vampires or werewolves for all you care?! In the end, shouldn’t it matter what actions we have done? Have you already forgotten what we had to go through to save you all?! Not only did we bring you and your families here, we shared our home and our food with you, made sure to protect you and even helped you all grow stronger, but suddenly because of some message you started to doubt us?!"

"Fine, whoever feels that we don’t deserve their trust, get out and leave this place!" Nate now shouted in a furious tone, making all of the trainees and even Helen drop their heads in embarrassment and shame.

"Come on Nate, it’s not like that! How are we supposed to react after hearing such news? We just know that the Graylash family got attacked by one of their own and now suddenly we have to come to terms that the same type of people are hidden amongst us! We’re just scared." One of the braver trainees defended their actions.

Meanwhile, Sam went around to get a picture of what the general thoughts were after everyone had heard the message. Just as he had suspected the hushed comments weren’t really in their favor. The people talked about another race of people that they had never known about, and some others had already figured out that the codename V was just a substitute for the myth known as vampires.

They wondered if those of the Cursed faction might actually be working with the Dalki to secretly take them, and how could they trust each other now. How could they trust that the Cursed faction were really on their side and weren’t planning on turning on them eventually.

’I knew something like this was going to happen!’ Sam thought, his fists tightened in fury. ’We’ll be lucky if even half of our own faction continues to trust us for not having come out ourselves earlier.’

A few seconds later and all the screens that had turned off seconds ago, all lit up once again, this time the one that could be seen was none other than Owen. As World Leaders, they were able to send out an emergency message like this whenever they wished.

"Greetings, everyone. I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of you are currently frightened after hearing what has happened and learning of the existence of a new race. Personally, I don’t know why they decided on the stupid name V, so let’s just call them by the name most of you must have already figured out. Vampires!" Owen began in an unexpected way that was guaranteed to get him an earful from Oscar later.

"First of all, let me start by saying that they aren’t like the stories you might have read in books and such. Not all races are like the Dalki, and we have already come to learn that not all of them are bad. I have decided to come out like this, because I felt that Oscar’s message has left out too much. I wish to rectify that, by publicly stating that Quinn Talen, the leader of the Cursed faction, has saved my life on multiple occasions. Not just mine, but many of those on my fleet owe him for that! We all owe the Cursed faction."

"You may have your doubts, but there is not a single doubt in my mind that Quinn and his Cursed faction are on our side! Right now, I trust them more than even my own family members, which is why if anyone from my family has anything negative to say about the Cursed faction in my presence, they will be severely punished!"

"As one of the World Leaders, and leader of the Graylash faction, we completely stand behind Quinn and his Cursed group of vampires!"
