Chapter 1061 - Uncovering the Demon tier beast

At times, Quinn would be delighted to see a quest pop up. It was a chance for him to evolve, and grow stronger, which was exactly what he needed. The most common way for him to get a quest from the system was when he was facing a strong opponent.

However, this one, and lately the quest he had been receiving of late, were involving others, and he didn’t like it at all. His body was screaming, telling him he needed to return back as soon as possible and the system message wasn’t the only reason he knew he needed to.

It was also due to the connection he could feel. He could tell that the others were locked in some sort of combat.

’I have confidence in their strength, but who or what are they fighting? The Marked?’ Quinn thought.

’It looks like the Demon tier is able to take over the human hosts whenever it wishes based on what we have seen. Perhaps, the Demon tier beast has turned all those captured already.’ Vincent added.

"We need to go back now, the base is in trouble." Quinn said.

"But you said this is a Demon tier beast’s doing, correct? Shouldn’t we focus on that, maybe we can find the others as well?" Ko replied.

Ruffling of leaves and trees being pushed over were heard from the forest. Quickly using his inspect skill, Quinn could see many different beasts hidden, coming towards them at all sorts of different levels.

"Are those beasts, how many more are coming over to us." One of the Orbus leaders said.

There were a lot, and even with Quinn taking them all out with a single hit, it would delay their goal of getting back to the base.

’Wait a second, all of the beasts, they’re coming from the Shelter. Is that what they are trying to do, slow our return back? If the Demon tier really knows I killed that Moth on my own, then it would make sense. Does it have an idea of my power?’

"I can’t waste anymore time convincing you guys, you just have to believe me that the base is being attacked. You can either come with me, or stay to fight those beasts." Quinn said, as he activated his shadow travel and hopped into it.

As the ruffling of the trees got louder, knowing that the beasts were nearly upon them, it didn’t take them long to hop into the shadow and come with him.

Traveling through the shadow they could avoid everything. It was fast and while in his shadow space, they could head directly to the shelter.

"Is this the same place as last time? I don’t see anyone else." Ko said, thinking about the place where Quinn had trapped all the other Marked.

"No, this is different, you can see where we are above." Quinn replied.

As they looked up, they could see the trees and ground. It was like they were traveling in an underground vehicle with a glass roof above them.

If Quinn wanted to get there urgently, he could have used his shadow link to transfer himself to Linda, but he had a feeling that as time went on, the problem would increase. He could see on his quest bar that the number of those infected were rising.

The only thing he could do was find and defeat the Demon tier beast as soon as possible. Still not being able to get it out of his head, he decided to use his mask to call the others, and spercfcelly called Linda.

"Linda, you answered, I guess that means you guys are okay for now, what’s happening over there?" Quinn asked.

"Quinn, you need to come back as soon as possible, I believe the whole shelter is in trouble. The Marked have taken over the Graylash family members and they are stronger than ever. You need to be careful." Linda replied.

The other two could hear everything, and they couldn’t believe that the Graylash family had been Marked. She continued to explain what had exactly happened, how much they knew of the events so far, but also said they were unaware of the situation on the outside.

’So the Graylash members might have been infected from the beginning?’ Quinn thought. ’And they have no clue where Robin is or if he has been infected as well. The inspect skill only worked when I looked at the marking directly, so the clothes might have covered it up.’’

"What about you guys, are you okay, can you hold out for a bit longer or do you need me there?" Quinn asked.

There was silence for a bit on the other end, as Linda was a little nervous, but she finally replied.

"Yeah, don’t worry about us. We are going to be just fine, I don’t think this Demon tier beast knows exactly who he is messing with, you do what you need to do." She replied, and hung up there.

Thinking about the call, he wondered what she could have meant by that. Was she talking about Sil? With Sil there, as long as he had strong abilities, he would protect them all, even from the Demon tier beast itself.

Eventually, Quinn had reached the shelter. They could now see it from a distance. He exited from the shadow, and quickly pulled the other two up with him, scaling a tall tree.

The others were about to complain about what Quinn was doing to them, when they could see it now from up high. Walking through the forest from all directions of the Shelter, were humans. Or, to be more precise, it was the Marked, but it wasn’t a small number of the Marked.

It was the rest of the missing people. They were all plodding along, moving slowly towards the Shelter. When they arrived with the gates open, they could enter with ease.

"What is going on, why are they all heading towards the Shelter?" The Orbus leader asked.

"I guess you were right, something really is going on at the Shelter. Everything we heard seems true. Even the Graylashes on the wall seem to be doing nothing." Ko said. "There are thousands of them, and nearly everyone inside the shelter has already been infected that will be tens of thousands of people."

"Why now?" Quinn mumbled, looking at everything.

"What do you mean?" Ko asked.

"The Demon tier beast, you said people have been going missing since the start of the shelter. You’ve suffered from attacks time and time again. We have figured out that it’s due to them already being Marked by the Demon tier. It was almost as if the Demon tier was waiting to build up an army large enough to get rid of you.

"There were other Shelters on this planet before, right? Did they suffer any of the same attacks?" Quinn asked.

"No, not that I know of." Ko said, figuring out what Quinn was getting at.

"So why does the Demon tier want to so badly get rid of you all? Why is it still sending everyone to this place now? Did you take something from it, did you anger it without realizing it from the very first day since you got here? No, that makes no sense, and considering the type of demon tier beast it is, my bet is that the demon tier has been in the shelter the whole time.

"It’s the only way to explain how the Graylash family were Marked as well."

"A Demon tier in the shelter, are you crazy!" Ko shouted. "We would have found it by now if that was true, and what about all the signals that we receive from your device are you saying they were faulty?" Ko argued.

"Signals, didn’t you see what they did to the Marked, and didn’t you hear what my people said earlier. That they can control a Marked to the point where it can communicate, even empowering them. Perhaps it was giving fake signals powering beasts they had captured or the missing people, and if you want to know why? To take us further and further away from the goal."

Quinn had an idea what the demon tier beast was, but he wasn’t quite sure yet, and he was sure there was one way to find out.

"You two, you are on your own from here. Make your way inside or stay here until it’s safe, that’s down to you, but I can’t protect you guys." Quinn said as he got in his shadow travel, and headed towards the largest thing he could see in the centre.

Due to shadow travel, he could go under the walls that had been built and all the Marked seemingly ignored him until he had finally reached the largest thing in the centre: the giant pink tree.

Getting out from his shadow, Quinn was ready to take this thing down, at the same time falling from the top of the tree, something could be seen and as it hit the ground, lightning flew up in the air all around it.

"Very impressive, but I have to ask, how did you know?" The person standing in front of Quinn said, who was none other than Robin. He too had the top half of his robe taken off, and the red branch markings could be seen everywhere.

Quinn smiled.

"Honestly, I didn’t but there were a few guesses I had made, there was something I noticed when I was shown a beast with the pattern before. It’s not every day that a human gets turned upside down, but with the beast’s skin, I saw it.

"The red marking, the branches that stem out on everyone, it looks exactly like this tree, but of course that could have just been a guess. Then, with my keen eyes and senses, I looked for the strongest power in this area, which led me to you, Robin...or should I call you a Demon instead.

"It would make sense for the Demon tier to put most of its power into the strongest human it could find. I heard that you failed to get my friend Sil, so why not stick to Robin, but that still doesn’t answer your question.

"From the way you have been acting so far, you seem to be very cautious. I judged from the way your powers work that perhaps you weren’t able to attack yourself. It’s a very strong power you have. Now, if one couldn’t defend itself, where would it place its strongest piece.

"Putting all these things together, it was just making my guess seem more true, and in the end. If I took down a giant tree and it wasn’t the Demon tier beast, then that’s no harm done, is it?" Quinn explained.

In his mind, Quinn could hear the sounds of clapping.

’Brilliant deduction Quinn.’ Vincent said. ’I’ve never seen you use your small brain of yours so much. Damn, someone should have recorded that and played it back to the rest of the Faction. Unfortunately, figuring out where the Demon tier beast was, is the easy part.

’Now the hard part begins. Without your shadow powers, this will be a tough battle.’

"You are right, I have been cautious." Robin replied. "And maybe that made finding me easier, but it doesn’t matter."

Falling from the tree, even more Graylash members were seen and in total, including Robin, there were now ten of them.

"You think I didn’t know they were up there as well?" Quinn replied as he prepared himself. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"I have a good guess of your power Quinn from how you defeated my pawn of a Moth but if that is all of your power, then this will be a walk in the park." Said Robin.
