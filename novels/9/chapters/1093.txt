Chapter 1094 - Admitting the truth

From the second the three of them had gotten off from their ship and had entered the docking bay of the Bertha, Quinn had been able to tell something was up. From the person who had been assigned to welcome them, to the excessive amount of people that had come to escort them it wasn’t hard to tell.

Their eyes had been constantly darting around the room, their heartbeats had been frantic and lastly, as vampires all of them had noticed the blood being stored in the ceiling above.​​

’Just like Eno said, if they decided to drop a pile of blood in front of us, then that means they know something.’ Quinn thought.

At the same time, Sam was looking at the men who were now behind them, and although they hadn’t quite pulled out their weapons just yet, their fingers were twitching while watching them for any sudden moves.

"Come on, isn’t this what you guys are after?!" Innu shouted, smiling like a mad man.

However, the reactions of Quinn, Sam and Eno were not at all what they had expected. The trio of guests just stood there, looking at each other and their hosts.

"What are you talking about? Do you take us for some hungry beasts?" Sam questioned as he looked towards Innu who he took for the one to come up with this idea. Still, he had to admit he was a little nervous. While Eno and Quinn could handle themselves if a fight was to break out, Sam wasn’t confident enough that he could do the same, so he would rather not reveal their secret right now.

’They’ve found out somehow, so if we come forward with what we know now, it will just sound like an excuse.’

"Well, things certainly seem to be fine for now." Oscar cleared his throat, his face had actually turned a shade redder as he was quite embarrassed that the three had reacted as any normal person would have in such a situation.

After learning from Samantha about Fex, and his d.e.s.i.r.e for blood, they started to focus on witness accounts on the second fleet which had led to some very interesting information. Multiple of the crew survivors had stated that they had seen those with red eyes latching onto humans and biting into their necks. L.i.c.k.i.n.g the blood of their hands as they killed their enemies.

At first it had seemed like they had been exaggerating or perhaps their attackers had gone mad, but now the reports were starting to add up. What if this new source of power was powered by blood, which was why the Cursed faction had always carried a flask with them that contained blood inside?

Eventually, after finding biting marks on some of the victims’ bodies and talking to many established minds they had come to one fairy tale conclusion. About the mythical beasts known as vampires.

Although it seemed ridiculous, Innu had been the first one convinced that this was the right answer, and had somehow managed to get Oscar to play along with this little test. The books stated that they were beasts that would do anything for blood, that they would crave it and go out of control at the mere sight of it.

Now, Oscar felt nothing but embarrassment, and didn’t really know how to progress things forward.

"With all this blood, It looks like you figured out the truth, well should we have that talk you were talking about earlier, or should we just show them our fangs." Eno asked out loud and clear so each one of them could hear.

Sam started to laugh trying to play it off as just some joke from the old coot next to him, but it was clear he was nervous, and Quinn was just there shaking his head, probably regretting not having told Eno to stay back. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Meanwhile, outside of the room, Owen Graylash had just arrived along with Hermes not too long ago. For now, he would only allow Hermes to be by his side, and his more capable men, that he did trust would be in control of the fleets while he was away.

"I’m warning you, you better answer my question." Owen threatened the man. "I have had my fair share of traitors recently, and I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that everyone on this ship is one either. One of the only few people I trust at the moment is Quinn Talen, so you better tell me where he is. Don’t think just because I recently came out of hospital I don’t have the power to electrocute a small fry like you!"

The man looked around nervously, but this just infuriated Owen more. The next moment the captured men felt a tingling sensation go up his arm. He might have been under orders, but with this kind of pressure, he confessed to everything. After going to the training room, where Quinn and the others were meant to be, Owen didn’t slow down with his intimidation.

"What is that old man thinking to lock up Quinn in such a room?!" Owen couldn’t believe Oscar’s action. "Open the door now, before I break it down! This is an order as the head of the Graylash family and one of the world leaders!"

The two guards that were standing behind the large closed door looked at each other, and then heard the sound of Owen’s ability activating, and soon the doors opened.

"What’s going on now?" Oscar asked, as he could see the doors opening. "I told them to not let anyone inside!"

When they finally opened up, Owen barged into the room, and could feel the tension between the two sides, as well as everyone who was getting ready to fight.

"Well, looks like I came just in time to help you out." Owen said, standing by Quinn and the others.

"Graylash!" Innu shouted. "Don’t you know what they are, they just admitted it as well...they’re vampires!"

There was silence in the whole room, and even a sweet soft smile had come from Owen’s mouth, but when he looked at Quinn. In a defeated kind of way, all Quinn could do was nod.

"This is actually bad timing." Quinn sighed. "I don’t know how you guys found out, but after what happened with Owen, I was going to share some things with you during today’s meeting."

"However, if this is the way you were planning to treat us after finding out the truth, then maybe it’s a good thing that we didn’t tell you anything." Quinn spoke and at that moment his eyes started to glow red.

Honestly, Quinn didn’t like the way they were treated after everything he and his group had done to help Oscar and the others. Were they honestly thinking of them as some kind of savage beasts who would have gone crazy over the sight or smell of blood? Had they intended to put them down if that had truly been the case? Had everything they had done up until this point been meaningless?

Seeing the red eyes, Owen understood that Quinn was being dead serious. They were the same type as the ones he had seen before he was stabbed, for a second Owen flinched. It was hard to get rid of a trauma like that and so soon. However, he also remembered how much Quinn had done for him and placed his hand on his shoulder.

"I don’t care what you may be, to me you’re Quinn Talen of the Cursed faction!" Owen stated. "I will stand by your side."

This had managed to quell Quinn’s anger a little, but he still was looking towards Oscar and the others.

"We’re sorry Quinn." Samantha apologised, as she stepped forward. "We’re sure you’re not like the ones who attacked us. I had my suspicions, ever since Fex made me save him using my blood. I saw him heal after consuming it and he also used your red powers. We never planned to hurt you, it’s just that the Graylash family aren’t the only ones that have suffered from attacks, and we’re confused and scared about such a thing popping out so suddenly."

It was a plea, and Quinn could tell that she was generally serious.

"Let’s try calm the tension down on both sides, huh?" Sam suggested. "Let us share what we know, I think it would be good for us to sit down, and maybe hold the meeting later after everyone had time to digest the new information." Sam smiled.

"I agree." Oscar nodded. "Perhaps our test was just a show of fear for us. My daughter is right though." Oscar placed his hands on top of Smantha’s shoulder. "It’s fact that you guys always have helped us and nobody will be able to claim otherwise. Everyone clear out, we shall head into the main command centre." Oscar ordered.

Walking to the command centre, from behind though, Oscar had his own thoughts.

’Quinn, I’m not a fool, whatever you and your group have become, whatever you have done I know we need you to defeat the Dalki, but knowing that there is another race out there, one that feeds off humans, this is a dangerous matter for all of us humans.’
