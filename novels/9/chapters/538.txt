Chapter 539 What family?

Most of the soldiers had decided to head back to their temporary base that they had out on the field. While three of the men, including Lieutenant Bugen, had decided to come on board the ship. When entering, even though they wished to keep their composure, it was hard for them too.

Their eyes continued to dart around the room at the spectacle that the ship was. They knew that there couldn’t be many in existence being made of this caliber. Most likely the military only had a few. This was why, when they first saw it, they believed it was coming from headquarters. It was a big surprise when they saw head general Paul on board.

One of the rooms on the ship was a meeting room, and it was made for situations just like this and they were on their way heading there now. In order to not make things look suspicious. The others including Quinn were acting like Paul was their leader.

They followed him behind as a group while Paul talked to the lieutenant. They were quite a distance away. So much so that the lieutenant thought he would be free to speak without the others hearing him. Unknown to him that most of the kids had super hearing abilities and could hear every word that was spoken.

"Is it okay for them to come along with us for this meeting?" Bugen asked.

There were a few things Bugen found strange when entering the ship. The first being how empty it was. Seeing the thing, they thought a whole fleet would be on board. He never expected there to be so few people. The second problem was that said people.

They were a bunch of kids to put it politely. Most of them looked extremely young. It didn’t make sense why a head general was even with them in the first place. However, only a head general would be able to have access to a ship such as this one.

"They are with me, it’s fine, they will not be a problem. The situation is an odd one, but for now, they are under my direct command. I’m sure we both have a few things to talk about." Paul replied.

Turning his head, Bugen still wasn’t sure, and as soon as his eyes met Quinn’s he turned away.

When entering the meeting room, there were chairs that were scattered around the edges of the room, not too far off from the table in the center. Then there were also a few chairs around the table.

In a meeting like so, it wasn’t normal for one to have their whole crew sitting at the table. One would usually bring only a couple of men with them, and Paul knew this, so he made some quick decisions.

He asked Quinn, Vorden, and Logan to come with him and sit at the main table for the meeting. While the others sat on the chairs around the edge. They could still hear what was going on in the meeting but couldn’t really interject or be a part of it.

"Oh, they will be joining us?" Bugen said, surprised. He actually wasn’t but wanted to know if there was something special behind picking these.

"You will be surprised how talented these kids are." Paul replied. "I believe they will be some of the people to lead us in the future."

To them, it may have sounded like a stray comment, but deep down, Paul actually felt that way a little. He really did think these three were different from the other students he had met before.

After sitting down, it was time for the meeting to commence. Paul was the highest rank, so he would be taking charge and asking most of the questions. The three boys at the table knew they wouldn’t be able to interject much.

"First question, since we are here. What happened to Dreamland? I find it hard to believe that a city that was protected by Truedream would just disappear overnight?" Paul asked.

The lieutenant paused for a bit before he answered and then spoke slowly.

"That’s actually why we are here, the truth is we don’t know what happened."

A confused look appeared on all of their faces, and this only confirmed Bugen’s thoughts.

"Sir, if I may ask, how long were you gone for?"

"I was assigned a special task by the supreme commander. We were on a red portal planet doing some investigations for a little over a month. Unfortunately, my team ran into some difficulties. They are currently missing. At the time we were mentoring a group of students from the second military base."

"These here are the only ones that have returned with me. When we arrived at the second base. Everything was destroyed. The soldiers were dead and there was nothing left of the school. After getting on board the ship we proceeded to head onto the nearest city and that’s when we located you."

A deep frown was seen on Bugen’s face as if he was struggling with what to say.

"A month, was it really only that long ago when things were normal?" Bugen spoke to himself. "I suppose you really don’t know what has happened then."

From the tone of his voice, it sounded serious, and the others were listening intently.

"It might come as a shock to you, but in that short time, many things have changed. I bet most people wished we were still the way we were two months ago. It actually all started right here, and it’s why we were sent over for an investigation."

"Everything had been proceeding as normal, and one day out of nowhere, Dreamland city was no more. It had completely disappeared. We did an initial investigation and what you see now is what we saw back down. The whole city was destroyed."

Paul’s hands were starting to sweat a little. So many questions were going through his head. "One of the big four? Who did this, and what of Truedream is he still alive?"

Putting his head down in disappointment, Bugen couldn’t even look at his superior when reporting this. "We have no idea who did this. As for Truedream, he is currently missing. We assume he’s dead, just like everyone else from this city. Not a single person who was a resident of Dreamland has been found alive."

Fex, and Kazz didn’t really know what was going on, but judging by the look of the other faces, it was pretty serious. At least Fex understood one thing, a whole City had been taken out, and they had no idea who had done it. That alone was a scary thought.

What was even more scary was that he didn’t realize, was that the city was owned by one of the strongest forces in the human world.

Tightening his fist, Paul now realized why he was saying the world had changed. There were many simulations that they had run. Many plans put in place. With the way, the military ran things, they were heavily reliant on Truedream’s power.

It was the only thing keeping so many of the others in check and obeying their extreme methods. What would happen if Truedream was to disappear?

"The world is in a civil war..." Paul said quietly.

All the soldiers could do was nod silently.

Quinn couldn’t believe it. One of his most hated people had gone just like that. He didn’t know how to react; he didn’t know what to do nor what was happening. Getting rid of one person really affected the world that much?

Nevertheless, there was something he noticed while he sat down at the table. He could hear a certain individual’s heartbeat, thumbing faster and louder than the others. It was from someone he didn’t expect. It was Vorden.

’Does he know something, why is he panicking?’

Vorden did know something. There weren’t many powers that would go after Truedream like so. He couldn’t think of any other family that could wipe out an entire city without anyone realizing. He was a hundred percent sure the Blades were involved.

But there was still something that didn’t make sense.

"The school." Vorden blurted out. "Who attacked the military basis?"

Usually, a student asking such a question to a higher superior would be an offense, but Burgen could see that the students were affected by the news. Who wouldn’t be if they had suddenly come back and heard of this, so he let it pass. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

"The military was the first to find out about the disappearance of Trudream. Of course, we did everything in our power to keep this a secret from the other families and our own soldiers. However, could you imagine trying to keep something this big a secret? It was impossible, and it only took a matter of time."

"The supreme commander predicted that soon, someone would make a move. He didn’t know who or when, so he started to make his own moves. Moving important figures and equipment from the base to the main headquarters, to the first base. It was important that everything wasn’t done at once. It would alert the other families of what was to happen."

"As predicted, one of the powerhouses made the first move. It was one of the big four, or big three I should say. They had attacked every base one by one. Freeing those that were kept in the dungeon."

"What family?" Vorden asked with a little panic in his voice.

"It was the Graylash family," Bugen replied.

The name brought back memories for Quinn. The Graylash family was one of the big four, and at the time of the military base event, he had caught the attention of others for how young he was. The youngest leader in history of the Graylash’s.

Now the scorch marks on the victims made sense. They had come from the power of lighting.
