Chapter 1851: Students Clash. (Part 1)

For vampires, there were mainly three different types of evolutions they could have. A regular vampire, a vampire noble, and a vampire lord. Most vampires would remain vampires. They could train hard, try to improve, yet could never get their body to evolve to the noble level.

It was similar to humans that had just a limited amount of MC cells, or remained at a certain ability level for so long. Then there were the vampire nobles. At times there would be those that would be born with such bodies, however in other cases, there would be those that evolved into vampire nobles.

At times, there was a little help needed from the leaders, there were rituals and techniques that could bring out the energy that was stuck in their body that would allow them to move onto the next level of a vampire nobel. Of course this wouldn't work if they were just never destined to be at the vampire noble level to begin with.

The very best vampire nobles were usually selected to become vampire knights for their family. Vampires respected power greatly and found it hard to take orders from those that they saw below them.

However, if one became a vampire knight, according to tradition, it meant that they were unable to become a successor to the family. They were unable to become the leader.

When a leader picked their vampire knights they would usually have this in mind, and at the same time they would be training a successor. This would usually be a direct son or daughter of the current leader, but this wasn't just due to family ties, there was a reason for this.

All of the vampire leaders had evolved to the stage of vampire lord. Since vampires wouldn't like to serve someone weaker than them, this had become somewhat of a minimum requirement, although not an official requirement.

Being a direct descendent meant, in most cases, that they had the ability to evolve their body to the final stage of a vampire lord. In some cases, they also had rituals to summon forth the power as well.

But doing so too early would be a mistake. It was always best for a vampire to reach the peak of the evolution they were at before doing any forced rituals for evolution. Otherwise, it would greatly affect their growth.

Of course, leaders at times would train more than one successor in case anything happened to one of them, and all of these successors would have the potential to evolve to the vampire lord stage. This had brought on the thought that the vampire knights were unable to evolve to the vampire lord level.

This was not true, it was just that if a good leader saw that one could turn into a vampire lord, they would raise them as one of the successors.

Which was why, when Quinn was creating his family, he had thrown all of that tradition and logic out of the window. On top of that, no one knew why, but those that he had turned, or those that became special vampire subclasses, pretty much disregarded the normal rules that they knew before.

In fact, no one really knew what Quinn was right now, because it was clear he was no longer a vampire lord, and no one before him had ever been able to surpass that level.

Leo, all on his own, had activated the red aura in his body to allow his body to evolve. He had done what the ritual usually would have done in its place.

Immediately, he grabbed the blade, and struck the air. Sera was expecting to hear the constant ring he had heard before, but there was no sound this time, not even when the sword had gone through the air.

"I have to thank you for your advice." Leo smiled as he placed his sword away.

"I have to admit, I was considering your other offer of improving my weapon, but I don't think I will be needing it anymore, and besides, victory earned through one's own struggles is far more rewarding."

The night was spent quietly for the two of them, and it looked like even Sera was setting something up. He had told Leo he would be exploring the island as he looked at the shape of the landscape for the entire area.

Since Leo had been taking this fight seriously, Sera who respected Leo had decided to take it seriously as well. Then, when the sun rose, it was finally the next day. The two of them waited, walking around the island and looking out at the sea to see if they could spot anyone or anything.

It wasn't yet noon, or the meeting time, but it was the only thing they could do. Time felt like it was moving at a snail's pace. Whenever they would check the time thinking 30 minutes had passed, it had only been 10.

Then finally, exactly when it was midday, at 12:00 o'clock on the dot, Sera spotted something coming out of the water. It was a small sized submarine that had a large clear outer glass front.

It broke through the waves and stopped short of the island by about twenty metres out in the sea. The lid of it opened up, and jumping out of it and standing now on the body of the submarine were two people.

One with scars covering his whole body, he had no shirt on at all, but had two katana-looking blades on his back, and then there was Zero. With a single katana style blade by his side exactly like Leo. Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

The second Leo saw the two, his heart started to thump louder, stronger, and a strange feeling was rushing all over him.

"So it really was you this whole time. You were really Zero, Master Kasu." Leo stated.

"You look different compared to that time. The time we both decided to part ways from each other, many years ago."

Kasu looked like a middle aged man in his forties. There were no significant details that would make him stand out. Unlike the mountain of man that was next to him, he had a scruffy beard on his face, a fierce look, and long hair, although it was tied up in a ponytail.

As for what Leo meant by different, it was because his master was already a relatively old man when Leo knew him, and now he looked younger. However, without a shadow of a doubt this was him.

After meeting Chris and learning that all of Pure knew how to use Qi, for a while now Leo had assumed that the leader, the man named Zero, was actually his master. However, he felt like there was a chance that it wouldn't be true.

It was just someone else, who looked like him, but that wasn't the case at all. Leo had heard from Quinn about what he had seen, he had witnessed himself how far Pure were willing to go, experimenting with those from the Bree family and more. The man that he used to know, the one he used to call master, would have never gone so far.

"I can see your upset." Kasu shouted.

"Why though? Your appearance has also drastically changed from when I last saw you as well. You look younger and stronger. Isn't it for the same reasons as me?"

Leo didn't know what to say, the words wouldn't form in his mind. "Why have you done all of this, couldn't you have just passed on in peace. You would have been able to rest with the others."

Zero started to laugh out loud. "You really believe that, because let me tell you now, I know that's not true at all. I have learned how the world works Leo, unlike you. We are nothing in this entire world, nothing."

"Our lives mean nothing but I am the one that is going to make it so our lives truly mean something in this entire universe, and that includes you as well."

Leo just shook his head. The tone of voice, the anger, and power behind his words, wasn't how his master used to speak.

"I understand the loss for you was great back then, and it is hard to move on... but in this life, you can't always be looking for someone to blame. In the end there was nothing we could do, and those loved ones have moved on, we should focus on the new lives that are in front of us!"

Taking out his blade from his side, Zero pointed it toward Leo. "You using those words truly means your eyes have yet to be opened. You can't even realise that the man next to you... is like them."

"He is one of them. I am afraid you have gone to the other side and it's too late."

"I agreed to your terms and the one that will be fighting you Leo, is the one that I have raised from the beginning."

"The new me, raising one that can't die to those fools like the Dalki. Chris! Take him out."
