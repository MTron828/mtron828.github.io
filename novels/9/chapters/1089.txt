Chapter 1090 - A Special Power

’Do you make it a point to forget everything I told you?’’ Those were the first words from Vincent after he had listened to Quinn trying to figure out what was happening to Owen.

Quinn honestly didn’t understand why the world leader was currently in the state that he was in. In the past when his own red aura had entered someone else’s such as Leo, it had immediately infected them, so he couldn’t figure out why it didn’t happen in this case.

’I’m sorry, but can we skip the lecture part and get to the you helping me figure out the answer part?’ Quinn hurried Vincent along. ’Time is a bit of the essence... I think.’

’Regular vampires can’t just turn someone by biting them, or injecting their blood into their body. Remember when you first bit Layla? She didn’t turn because of it, now did she?’

’So just because a regular vampire struck Owen, and part of his blood is inside Oven doesn’t mean he will necessarily turn. Still, at least in this case the process has already been initiated. Just as you need to complete the ritual to turn someone, the same thing needs to be done here.’

Quinn understood what Vincent was saying, but that led to just more questions. Why attack Owen just when the battle was concluded? Sure he had been weakened, but there were so many that had him surrounded. It had always been impossible to turn Owen in the short time before someone would have intervened, even if it hadn’t been Oscar.’

’Was the vampire prepared to sacrifice himself from the start? Did he pay with his life so someone else could finish what he started?’ Quinn wondered.

"So can you do anything to help me, or did you just get my hopes up so you could rub my c.h.e.s.t?" Owen questioned, since Quinn had been quiet for an awkwardly long time with his hand placed on his c.h.e.s.t. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"Umm, yeah sorry, just give me a few moments." Quinn apologised, as he closed his eyes again.

Thinking back, there was a time when the red aura energy had entered Chris and he had been able to get rid of it before it had taken over his body. When teaching the kids at the school how to use Qi, he was also able to control the red energy, so perhaps, Quinn was also able to remove the energy from Owen at this moment, allowing his body to heal again.

Being careful with the task, Quinn raised his other hand and now both were placed on Owen’s b.a.r.e c.h.e.s.t. The robes were moved to the side to make it easier for Quinn to feel and control energy when there was skin to skin contact.

"How fortunate that you made everyone leave the room. If anyone were to see us like that, we would probably make many BL fans quite happy." Owen joked nervously.

’What the hell is BL?’ Quinn wondered.

"Umm, I kinda need to concentrate on this." Quinn replied with an awkward look. He might be unaware of what the abbreviation stood for, but judging from the tone it was nothing he would enjoy.

Seeing that Quinn was serious and seemed to have a way to potentially help him, Owen immediately shut up and closed his eyes as well. There was a dull pain that was constantly around his c.h.e.s.t. He could feel it, especially when the healer tried to do something about it. No matter what method they had tried, the pain had remained.

... and ye,t he could suddenly feel the energy moving.

’Quinn, you can actually do something about this?’ Owen was flabbergasted. ’Just where did you learn how to do that when even the professionals were unable to help me?’

At first it was just a little painful, as if someone was poking him with a needle, but soon enough it felt as if someone had stuck their b.a.r.e hand inside his body. Then the pain worsened and if he didn’t know any better he would have sworn that Quinn was ripping out his flesh.

Owen gritted his teeth during the procedure, doing his best to fight through the pain. He trusted the Cursed faction leader was not just torturing him for fun and that it would help him, so he did his best to endure.

’The family still needs me!’ Owen repeated like a mantra.

"ARGhhh!" Eventually he couldn’t take it anymore. It might have been different if he had been in peak condition, but he had barely recuperated.

"Sir, is everything okay in there?!" Hermes shouted from the other side of the door, ready to burst in at any second.

"Don’t you dare come in, or I’ll shock you myself!" Owen shouted back, feeling that whatever Quinn was doing, was working. He grabbed the pillow behind him and bit on to it, to muffle his cries, worried that it might break the other’s concentration.

Owen was huffing and panting, covered in sweat but after what had felt like an eternity to him the pain was subsiding. Looking down, Quinn’s hands left Owen’s c.h.e.s.t and now a red aura could be seen spiralling around floating. Quinn just chucked it to the side, and it splattered on the floor like blood.

Throughout the procedure Quinn had felt like a surgeon performing surgery and he was relieved it was successful.

"I think if you get someone to heal your heart now, that they might be able to do something about it. Once you recover you should also be able to use your powers again." Quinn said.

Owen wasn’t completely out of the woods yet, his body was still weak, and he felt like he was part machine, but he could tell that Quinn wasn’t lying. Doing his best to move the bed sheets and get out of his bed, he bowed down to Quinn. He slowly placed his knees on the ground and placed his head on the floor.

"I owe you so much Quinn. The first time I met you I knew you were special but I never imagined you would ever save my life in such a manner. You not only saved my people, but you also saved me! If there is anything I can do for you, just ask and I shall see it done at a moment’s notice!" Owen promised, still keeping his head on the floor.

"Please get up." Quinn quickly requested. He didn’t need to be a doctor to know that Owen should remain in bed for the foreseeable future. He even helped him off the ground and as he carefully pulled him up Quinn inserted some of his Qi energy inside of Owen, to make him feel better and stronger.

"You are just full of all sorts of tricks aren’t you." Owen mentioned, noticing the slight change in his condition. "I’m very tempted to ask you about your methods and about the person attacking me, but if you wish to not tell me I’ll understand."

Alas, sharing the fact that there was a secret race of vampires out there and that they had attacked him, seemingly so that they could convert or at least control him, Quinn didn’t really consider this to be the best time to tell the others all of that. Even if it was, he needed to speak with Sam over the best way to reveal this information, so they didn’t get chucked in the middle of the mess they were already in.

"About that favour." Quinn deliberately changed the subject to avoid the question. "I happen to be in need of some crystals. Do you think you could supply me with two Demi-god tier crystals? It doesn’t matter what type."

He knew how rare Demi-god crystals were, and not even the Graylash family had a Demon tier crystal, so he was unsure whether Owen could complete the request.

"Done." Owen said. "You will have them before you leave my home. But that can’t be all, or do you wish to say that my life is only worth two such crystals? No, I still owe you, consider the crystals are a gift for your faction."

This was a surprising outcome that Quinn had never expected, now the Cursed faction was in possession of one Demon tier crystals and four Demi-god tiers. The reason why Quinn had asked this was to improve his own equipment. There was a chance that only two crystals would need to be used on Eno, and now the rest could be turned into equipment.

Once the two of them were done, the others waiting outside were able to enter once again. All of the guards, Hermes and doctors rushed into the room. The subordinate could instantly see the colour had returned to Owen’s face.

"What happened?" Hermes asked, noticing the pillow that looked as if a dog had chewed through it.

"Nevermind that, just get those healers in here and let them try healing me once more." Owen ordered.

The best healers that the Graylash faction owned were called and everyone was waiting for their arrival.

"It looks like things have turned out better than you thought." Sam whispered over to Quinn, while they waited for the result of the healing.

"Yeah, but, but things like this might keep happening if we don’t decide what to do next." Quinn replied.

A total of four different healers affiliated with the Graylash family in some way entered the room, and they immediately went to Owen’s bedside. One of them was quite the old man, who rubbed his hands together, before he was ready to activate his ability.

He reached out his hand, but before he could touch the world leader, someone grabbed them mid air, and started to squeeze them quite tightly,

"What do you think you’re doing, young man?" The old man cried out in pain, looking at none other than Quinn.

"You sure have guts showing up here. Do you honestly think I wouldn’t notice?" Quinn answered and increased the pressure.

The guards were getting ready to defend the healer, while the others had moved away, but Quinn quickly grabbed the other hand as it started to move.

"Oh no, I won’t allow you to kill yourself too. You will have to answer my questions." Quinn said. "The rest of you can continue doing what you are doing. I’m going to speak to this one in private."

A shadow soon opened up, and Quinn and the healer disappeared.

"What the hell just happened?" Hermes asked, confused.

"It looks like Quinn has taken care of yet another traitor!"
