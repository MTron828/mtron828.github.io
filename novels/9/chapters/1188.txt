Chapter 1189 Trophy weapons

It was the last person to be called up onto the stage who had openly shown her disdain for the rewards, a young woman by the name of Iree Johnston, not much older than Quinn. Her weapon that was given to her was a long spear, scarlet red in colour.

Not all blood weapons had this coloration, but the ones Alex had crafted were special in that the Blood fairy had added a drop of his own blood during the process.

Of course, this made them a liability, since these weapons could one day be used against the Cursed faction, but at the same time, the way Quinn saw it, if the two forces were to ever clash and he wouldn‚Äôt be around, humanity would stand a chance.

Still, it was future proofing himself.

Everyone who had received one of these weapons had quickly come to the conclusion that they weren‚Äôt as great as their current weapons. They did appreciate getting a reward in public, and decided to consider it a sort of trophy rather than something that could be used for battle.

"What are we supposed to do with these toys? Why even waste precious crystals to create something so useless?" Iree confronted Quinn, unhappy with the spear.

‚ÄôI thought that the Daisy faction might take all the blood weapons for themselves, but since they are splitting it like this, I should have asked Helen to explain it to those who receive these blood weapons beforehand.‚Äô Quinn thought in hindsight.

Gasps sounded throughout the crowd and Helen was about to storm the stage and give Iree the biggest beating of her life, but the Cursed faction leader raised his hand, signalling her to let him deal with it.

"Every day we risk our lives out there, doing what we can to defeat beasts to harvest their crystals! We even had to fight off some of the Dalki recently, and this is what you do with the percentage we have to pay you?! Why don‚Äôt you give us something useful, or why isn‚Äôt that giant Cursed ship on the front lines out here with us?!" Iree complained.

Quinn had been half-expecting someone to react like this, in fact, he was quite surprised that those before her hadn‚Äôt done so already. He would have preferred teaching it to them somewhere less public, since they required the use of blood, but now it looked like he would have to give a live demonstration.

Walking over, Quinn picked up the spear from the ground and dusted it off. "Do you really think I would have come here personally to just hand out some ‚Äôtoys‚Äô? The weapons you‚Äôve been awarded are no ordinary beast weapons, designed by the Cursed faction‚Äôs team to help you face our one enemy." The Vampire Lord explained as he pulled out his flask.

"I can‚Äôt fault you for thinking that these weapons aren‚Äôt better than what you are using, but that‚Äôs only if you use them against beasts. It‚Äôs an entirely different story if you use them against the Dalki. I think it will be far more efficient to show you what I mean, care to spar with me?" Quinn suggested.

"A fight with you? I‚Äôm no idiot! All of us know what you are and how strong you are. You could probably beat me with an ordinary weapon!" Iree refused.

"Don‚Äôt worry, I don‚Äôt intend to use any of my beast gear or abilities. I simply planned to prove to you the strength of this weapon." Quinn‚Äôs shadow covered his body and his gear disappeared into his dimensional space. He had originally been in his full set, as it gave him the air of a powerful leader. He wanted to inspire confidence in the Cursed faction with it.

"How about this, I can see that you have your own King tier spear by your side. Please let me borrow it for the sake of this demonstration. You should know how strong it is, so please use the spear I provided just now to attack me, while I will just defend myself. Afterwards you can be the judge about how effective a weapon is." Quinn suggested.

Iree agreed to this, but before the Cursed faction leader handed over the spear he poured a green liquid from the flask onto the weapon.

"Green liquid... is that Dalki blood?" Some of those in the crowd whispered amongst themselves as they watched the blood weapon start to light up and radiate with power. Not wasting any time, Quinn threw the spear which landed directly in front of Iree, piercing the stage. She pulled it out and gave it a few swings, just so that he could immediately tell her mistake.

"This... how is that possible?" Iree asked. If she hadn‚Äôt seen it for herself, she could have sworn this was a completely different weapon from before.

"We have the best forgers and the smartest minds in the Cursed faction. They have been working day and night to create a new type of weapon that gets stronger when fighting against the Dalki!" With everyone‚Äôs attention on the new weapon, Quinn thought this to be the best time to explain.

All of them believed him, amazed at the ingenuity of the Cursed faction. The ones who had received the blood weapons, suddenly tightened their grips, suddenly appreciating the gesture far more than just minutes ago.

However, the liquid inside wasn‚Äôt actual Dalki blood. Knowing where he was going, Logan had come up with an idea, in case such a demonstration became necessary. Blood from his arm would come out green as well, and same for Borden, but Borden was too small.

Using the same amount of blood in their body, Logan was able to create a blood-like substance that was green in colour. The flask simply contained human blood. It was a shame that Quinn was unable to give all those with a blood weapon a flask but there were simply too many and he didn‚Äôt have enough.

Similar to vampires, the blood needed for blood weapons needed to be fresh. Away from the eyes of the others, Quinn would tell them the truth at a later time, so they understood that it just needed to be blood that activated the blood weapons.

With that, the event was over. The Shelter threw a little party with food and more this was the time for Quinn to try and get to know the members of his faction, but it would only last a couple of hours. He couldn‚Äôt afford to waste more time, since he would have to move to the next planet where he would hand out more of them to those deserving.

If he wasn‚Äôt a vampire this whole thing would have been quite exhausting but Quinn felt fine, and the kind words actually improved his mood. It was reassurance that he was doing the right thing.

When Quinn went to talk to the others, he found many of them thankful to him. Talking about the help they had received from the Cursed faction in many forms. Some of them talked about how their family members had struggled to get jobs, but had received one thanks to him. Unsure what they meant, Quinn asked more about it, until he figured out that it was due to the Green family‚Äôs involvement. Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

‚ÄôThose guys, they are doing so many things to make the Cursed faction such a great group.‚Äô Quinn was surprised and decided that he would have to thank them one of these days.

Once time was up, Helen grabbed him, and they moved on to the next planet, where the process was repeated. The faction leader of the said planet he would be on. would also be part of the group introducing him.

Here, he had a similar experience, where the others had given him praise, thanking him as the representative of the Cursed faction for looking after their families and more. These people knew the truth more than the others from the outside. With what blood Quinn had left he would provide a small demonstration at the end.

‚ÄôEveryone puts so much trust into me as their leader, but honestly it never really felt like I was doing it for them, but just me. To improve my own situations and to stop others from ending up in a similar situation to my old self. I didn‚Äôt realise how many people my actions would affect.‚Äô Quinn thought.

After the second party was over. They briefly returned to the Daisy faction where Quinn was granted a short break, before heading off to the third planet. Seeing that his mood was a lot better Helen was proud of what she had done.

"Quinn, I like seeing you like this. I hope that I can see this smile on your face for the rest of your life." She said standing up, ready to go to the third planet. Going through the main base, they eventually reached the teleporter room.

One of the Daisy faction members proceeded to turn on the teleporter, but there was no reaction.

"That‚Äôs strange, why won‚Äôt the teleporter turn on?" The worker wondered, scratching his head.

"Hmm maybe that teleporter is faulty. Let‚Äôs switch the schedules around. Please open the portal to Planet Frediani instead." Helen ordered, but the worker got the same result as he tried to open the portal.

‚ÄôTwo teleporters not working, doesn‚Äôt that mean...no..‚Äô Quinn thought, as a disastrous thought had entered his mind.
