Chapter 1008 - Visiting an old planet

Quinn had been in a bit of a sombre mood after what had happened to Sil. He couldn’t help but feel bad for his situation, but there was really nothing they could do for now. In a way, he also didn’t think that just bringing back Vorden and Raten would help things.

It would undoubtedly stabilise the situation with someone as powerful as him, but from the way Sil spoke, Sil was the original owner of that body. At any point and time, he could take over if he wanted to. So if in the future, even with Vorden and Raten, something terrible happened, Sil would still need help.

’Maybe we can figure it out with Raten and Vorden when they are back, but we still haven’t found anyone with an ability that could help.’ Quinn thought. ’Even if that ability has reappeared in someone, it could be dormant in their body, or the person could just be a baby. I wish I knew more about abilities and how they worked because right now, it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack.’

Today, before school was to start, the homeroom teachers had been called in for a meeting. It was a bit more casual as the meeting took place in the Teacher’s lounge, where teachers generally just relaxed on the sofa or prepared for their lessons.

The one who was giving the meeting was Samantha. Quinn went ahead and sat down with Fex and Peter, who were both teachers. But Helen wasn’t one so she hadn’t been invited.

"I’ve called you all here today to talk about the first portal outing that will be taking place," Samantha announced. "Now, as you know, we fear that the tensions are quite high at the moment. So we have banned portal outings to orange portal planets for students, so they will only be able to visit the green portal planets.

"However, since there are larger groups and far more students this time, there will need to be more teachers. Now Head General Innu has agreed to go on the expedition for support. I will also be heading out, despite neither of us being teachers.

"All homeroom teachers must attend with their classes for this expedition, and students will only hunt within an area with their teachers. This is just for them to experience hunting. We will still award points for Beast crystals that will go to certain houses, but students will not just be able to go off and explore on their own. Does everyone understand?"

Quinn was actually quite pleased with the new measures they had put this time for the hunt. Although the students wouldn’t have a real-world experience compared to when he went out, it was safer this way. If they had done this last time, then maybe fewer students’ lives would have been lost to the Dalki.

"Are other teachers allowed to come on this trip if they wish?" Fex asked, raising his hand.

"I don’t see why not. The campus will mostly be empty, so if you wish, you may." Samantha replied.

Fex was happy that at least he wouldn’t be left out of this one. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

With the meeting over, Quinn returned to his class and delivered the news. After doing so, a lot of the class was quite depressed.

"What’s wrong? Did something happen?" Quinn asked.

Venus looked around at all the unhappy faces and decided to answer for them.

"Teacher, we aren’t stupid, and we honestly don’t know why the school has decided to do this, but each of us was the weakest of our schools, and they’ve grouped us all together. Doesn’t that mean our class will do the worst?"

It seems that self-confidence was a huge issue, but rightfully so because what Venus had said wasn’t a guess. It was a fact. Even with beast weapons, it only gave them a fighting chance. Perhaps they would survive but to beat the other classes in a hunt was another story altogether.

On top of that, not everyone in Quinn’s homeroom class was part of the beast class. Only about half of them attended, so they were in an even worse position.

"Okay, listen up, if you want to get stronger, then when your lessons are over, instead of heading to your dorms, head back here to your homeroom classroom. I’m going to teach you all a little something." Quinn said with a smile on his face.

He had finally decided that these kids at least needed a fighting chance. Oscar was right, it would be best to prepare everyone for the war upon them, but there was a problem. Teaching everyone Qi wouldn’t change the balance.

The strong would possibly just get stronger, making the gap between students stay the same. Although it might be unfair for now, Quinn had decided to teach the weakest kids in his class Qi so that they would be on an equal level as everyone else.

’I think Leo will understand what I have done.’ Quinn thought.

When the lessons ended, Quinn expected a few of his students to return to him, not all of them. However, every single one was now in his classroom, wanting to see what he wanted to teach.

"Today, I’m going to teach you something that will improve your natural body strength. Your punches will be stronger, your body will move faster, and when you get hit, it will hurt a lot less, but there’s one thing I want you all to promise me now." Quinn said.

"I don’t want you to try to get revenge after this. If you become stronger than those that used to bully you, then take pride in that. Don’t become what you hated."

Some of the students started to talk to each other, wondering why they would ever do that? But Quinn knew that some people would, and he hoped when they were put in a similar situation, they would think back to what he said right now.

"Also, it’s safe to say what I’m about to teach you all should be kept a secret. Otherwise, others outside of this class might abuse the power." Quinn explained. "What I’m teaching you all today is called Har..."

When teaching the kids Qi, Quinn had chosen to rename it to Har. His reasoning for this was that he didn’t want the military to know what he was doing just yet or Pure members. Word would get out of what was happening eventually. Unfortunately, Qi had a negative stigma of being attached to Pure, but at the same time was highly sought after due to the display of its powers.

Naming it Har, a technique that would just improve one’s body, didn’t sound that great, and that was exactly what Quinn was aiming for.

Over the next few days, the students began practising every day. There were even some students that decided it was a waste of time and had stopped showing up. Still, those that continued to learn the techniques and, using Quinn’s guidance, had prevailed. It was finally time for the class to go out on their first outing.

Quinn looked at his class all geared up, ready to go through the green portal, while Peter and Fex were by his side.

"Ready class," Quinn asked, and they nodded.

Going through the teleporter, when they arrived, it was a place that Quinn recognised quite well. The shelter was larger than it was before, but there was an unforgettable feeling of the planet.

"Do you remember this place?" Peter asked.

"How could I forget? It was where we first ran into the Dalki back then." Quinn whispered back.

It was a primarily desert planet all over, and the orange buildings made from sandstone stood out. In their memories, an unforgettable place.

Samantha made sure everyone was present from Quinn’s class, and then they would head off to a specific hunting area together. Classes were sent in hour intervals to not overwhelm the hunting areas and give everyone an equal amount of time. While Peter had decided to go off with Quinn and the students, Fex chose to do a bit of exploring.

’I originally came here to explore what Human life is like, and all I’ve done is hang out at schools. Let’s experience real human life.’ Fex thought.

Walking away from the training area and he headed to the main Shelter centre, where the place was filled with shops and merchants but what Fex was looking for was something else.

"That’s it, this place called a bar? There’s meant to be some really good drinks in here." Fex said with a smile, but he stopped for a few seconds as he pushed the door open.

’No, it can’t be. Why do I smell a vampire here, and it’s not Quinn.’
