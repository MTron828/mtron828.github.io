Chapter 1086 - Strong red eyes

The Dalki were known for having almost impenetrable bodies. Even shells shot from tanks wouldn’t necessarily harm them, yet the young man’s hand managed to pierce through it as if it was nothing.

’What is this? Why is my body moving away on its own? This has never happened before.’

The other Dalki in the dark canteen had instinctively distanced itself from Quinn. Dalki were battle hungry beings, carelessly diving into a fight at the first best opportunity not caring for the risk of getting hurt, as that would only further their growth.

However, for this reason Dalki were often unaware that they also had a human side in them. After seeing its companion getting killed with such ease, for the first time it experienced the feeling of fear.

Alas, it was far too late for it to flee. It didn’t take long for Quinn to move on to the confused creature and before it could react, its c.h.e.s.t had been pierced in the same manner.

"Y-You’re not... one of them." The Dalki let out with his last breath as he had the chance to take a closer look at its killer.

The survivors in the canteen were still shaking in the room, unable to believe what they had been barely able to see. Most of them had just heard two loud thuds as heavy objects had hit the floor.

When they peaked over, they could see a prominent dark shadow with red eyes standing there, yet it wasn’t large enough to be another Dalki. Eventually, one of the closests survivors who had seen everything came running out.

"They’re dead! HE SAVED US!" The young man cried out with tears in his eyes. There was blood on his body, but it was hard to tell whether it was his own or not.

’What is that idiot doing?! Did he already forget that our group got attacked by a group of humans beforehand? What if that’s one of the traitors and they just had a falling out? How could you leave your hiding spot?!’ Many of the cautious survivors couldn’t help but think.

Nevertheless, the red-eye shadow didn’t attack him. In fact, he appeared to help the young man up.

"Hey, I-I know you." The man proclaimed since he wasn’t attacked. He even created a spark with his finger, lighting up the place so everyone could see better.

For a second Quinn flinched from the sudden light. As a vampire he had been able to see perfectly well even in the darkness.

"You... you’re Quinn Talen! Leader of the Cursed faction! So those weren’t just rumors about you being able to take out an army of Dalki on your own!" The man called out in awe.

Instantly, many of the hiding survivors started to murmur amongst themselves and some of the braver ones also came out once the newcomer had been identified as someone they felt they could trust.

Despite the praise, Quinn was not smiling. From the moment he had entered the ship he had been able to smell the stench of blood in the air. Most importantly it hadn’t just been the blood of humans and Dalkis.

"There was a report from Owen calling for help so I got here as fast as I could." Quinn explained himself loudly. "I’ve just arrived, so I would welcome any information you could share with me. Like how many other Dalkis have you seen so far?"

It took a while for Quinn to process the information, as many people started to speak at the same time, and their accounts were also contradicting each other at times. Many had been unaware about the reason for the chaos until later on, with the majority having run away as soon as they had seen how powerful the Dalki truly were.

From what Quinn could gather, none of the ones in the canteen had made out a Dalki with a spike count higher than two, but perhaps even more importantly he had learned the fact that there were humans who had attacked each other. The common trait between them were their red eyes...

’Just like I feared, somehow vampires are involved in this whole mess! Based on what that first Dalki was saying he must have mistook me for one of them.’ Quinn thought. ’Are they working with Jim?’

Armed with new information, Quinn suspected that the Commander would head to the life support system based on the drills they had gone through so far, so that’s where he would head as well.

After all, the goal was to try to save the people on the ship.

Now he could try and help them evacuate... or he could take care of the root of the problem by killing off the invaders. But first, Quinn quickly disappeared into his Shadow space.

His gauntlets still had some of the green Dalki blood on and he didn’t want others to see what he was about to do. L.i.c.k.i.n.g a small part of the green blood the system granted him a temporary boost.

Once back, he was ready to head out, yet as he walked forward he noticed that a hundred or so people seemed intent on following him, a couple had even stumbled. Turning around Quinn saw that many of them were too injured to even move properly.

"I know that all of you must be afraid that Dalki on the ship, but I’m going to take care of them. I’m afraid that where I’m going, I won’t be able to protect you all. Honestly, coming with me is probably just going to put you into more danger." Quinn explained. "I cleared out the area on the way here. For the time being, this canteen should serve you as a pretty good place to hold up."

"Please, make room for those who are really injured. I’m unable to heal you, but I have a way to alleviate your situation." Quinn stated as he used his Shadow lock on five of the most injured people in the room. They were now safe from harm and wouldn’t slow down the others in case of trouble.

"Wait, let us come with you." A man who wore white robes with the insignia of the Graylash family stopped him. He introduced himself as Fow, and he had a brave face. Behind him stood five others, seemingly his bodyguards. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"This is our faction and our ship! It’s our responsibility to protect this place." Fow said.

At first Quinn wanted to reject them, but he could see that they weren’t doing it for selfish reasons they were good people. He then walked up to them and placed his hand on each one of them.

"You’re right, do as you like. I’m not your leader after all." Quinn agreed with a smile and ran off.

’They won’t get a chance to fight, but just in case.’

-----

Void and Bonny were at a loss as to what to do since the fighting ahead of them was coming to an end. The fact that they had been able to last for so long was undoubtedly due to Commander Hermes’ prowess.

However, there was a clear disadvantage between the two groups. It was hard to tell apart friend from foe for the crew members, yet that didn’t seem to apply for the invaders. In fact, it seemed as if they could see perfectly fine.

Void continued to film everything despite his hands shaking, and he was able to watch the red-eyed humans jump and run across the side of the walls at great speed. Without even having to come off them they were able to throw red lines of Aura.

"Is it an ability? But where have I seen or heard of something like this before?" Void thought.

"I’m afraid this is going to be a failure of a mission!" Hermes shouted. They had managed to kill three Dalki so far thanks to their strong drills, however there were still three more on the other side and on top of that five men with glowing eyes, while their side had dwindled down to five, not counting Bonny and Void.

"Everyone retreat, their forces outweigh us! Head back to the training room! We’ll barricade ourselves in there until help arrives." Hermes’ ordered.

Even if they managed to outrun the Dalki somehow, Hermes wasn’t sure help would arrive in time. They knew that Owen was busy dealing with the Dalki himself. If anything, the leader’s situation took priority over theirs.

The group continued to run as they threw lightning behind them. This time rather than strong attacks, they were firing off lighting sparks that would spread out to increase the chances of stunning the others for a short amount of time, buying them some time. From the looks of it, it seemed to be working.

"Void, don’t you dare drop or lose that camera! Make sure to record every single moment of this." Bonny reminded her cameraman, yet he suddenly stopped running.

Seeing this the others also slowed down and they could finally see what Void had seen up ahead. More pairs of glowing red eyes. At that moment, a couple of vampires that were clung to the walls by the side of the wall had leapt towards the group.

Before they could lay a finger on the group, two large slashes of red aura hit them larger than the ones before.

’All those guys with the red eyes seem to have that weird red aura ability. And this guy seems to be even stronger than the rest, but did he miss? What’s going on?’ Void wondered.

Pulling up his camera he looked through the lens to get a better look at who this stronger red eyed human was and once he recognised him, he couldn’t help but shout out in glee.

"Quinn!"
