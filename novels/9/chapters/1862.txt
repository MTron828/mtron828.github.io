Chapter Ôªø1863: Take down the ship (Part 1)

Everything that Chris said seemed more probable after hearing those words. Pure always had good relations with the Dhampirs, and with the latter's forces incredibly weakened, they needed to hide behind someone's back, and without a doubt, Pure was a good option for them.

At the same time, it explained why Zero wasn't currently on this base. And this also revealed a good reason why Chris wanted to betray Zero because Erin had beheaded the one person he had cared for, and now, She and Zero were working together even though the latter promised him revenge.

However, despite all of this, it was still hard for Muka to believe that they weren't walking into a trap, and she wanted to inquire about a few more important things.

"If you really wish to work with us, then you must answer the next few questions I will ask. Then, if I am satisfied with the replies, our group will agree to work with yours." She said,

It was natural for her to doubt Chris, and the others were quite apprehensive against the latter as well. After a moment of thought, Chris nodded, indicating to her to fire away the questions she had in her mind.

"Where are Zero and Erin as we speak? And what are they planning?"

"A planet was discovered with multiple Demon tier beasts. It's impossible for many to even survive in such a place. Still, they plan to work together and bring back as many Demon-tier crystals as possible, not only for themselves but also for those working under them. I hope I don't need to tell you what they plan to do with them." Chris answered.

Muka and Peter knew what Chris was talking about, and the others could tell from the story they heard. Depending on the Demon tier crystals, one could gain powerful Demon tier weapons. Not long ago, they had a first-hand experience of how strong Erin's current demon tier weapon was, and just the thought of her having more such gave all of them a headache.

At the same time, if there were enough of those crystals, then Zero could arm all the high-ranking Pure agents with the said weapons as well.

"What is Zero's true goal in all of this? You mentioned he talked about bringing the others back. Does that have something to do with all of this?" Muka asked.

Chris didn't answer this question straight away. It made Muka doubt that he might be trying to come up with a lie, but in the end, he gave the best possible answer he could.

"I don't know his ultimate goal, but I do know what he has recently done. He was focused on gaining as much energy as possible. So the slaves Pure has been buying, Zero was using his ability of Qi drain on them to add the power to his own. He has continued to do this for years, and it's one of the other things he has done that I can't agree with.

"And he's not just after the lives of others. He also strongly desired to get his hands on the Red Heart because it would be a purer source of energy, like nest crystals. And I'll be honest, it seems like he is not following his own plan but rather someone else's, but I don't know any more about this, and the last part is just my own suspicion, I don't have any proof of that."

This revelation came as a surprise to them. Zero was at the top of the food chain, so who would follow someone else's orders? Did the guy just go crazy over the last millennia, or was it perhaps something else? When Muka thought about it more, she came to one conclusion.

"He kept talking about bringing them back right, and you said he's following someone's orders. So maybe whoever he listens to has promised to bring them back?" Muka said out loud.

It was then that Chris's eyes lit up. He had been so close to Zero this whole time, yet the thought had never crossed his mind. It explained a lot of what he had heard and seen.

"Bring the dead back, but is that even possible?" Jessica asked.

"It doesn't matter," Chris answered. "All of Zero's feelings were true. It was all true when he said he cared for his students like they were sons or part of his family. So if someone told him they could bring them back, Zero would do anything, blinded by everything.

"What I'm wondering now though, is what does this other person want."

No one had an answer for that, so Muka decided to continue with her questions.

"You have Werewolf DNA inside you. Quinn confirmed that. The only people with Werewolf DNA were the vampire settlement. I remember the DNA was stored in the lab. Does that mean Pure is the one that was behind the vampire settlement attack? Do they currently have the missing tombs?"

When asking this question, Muka's voice contained frustration and rage because those tombs were very important to her and something she wanted to find out dearly. The old vampires, the originals who were still alive and their ancestors, needed to be respected.

"No," Chris answered. "At least, I don't think I know the answer. First, if Zero had the tombs, the only place he would keep them without worrying about them would be on this ship. However, I have never seen any tomb, and if you really wish, you can search this place from top to bottom for them.

"The reason why I'm saying I don't know though, is because Zero was the one that had the DNA. Pure had come across some files that were originally shared with us. They had details about how to mix humans along with beasts.

"There were problems at first, but with the help of the Bree family's ability, we succeeded in creating mixes that we could control. In the end, we had somewhat perfected this technique. Zero was the one who found the Werewolf DNA, although I have no clue from where. All I know is that it was not long after the initial contact with the dhampirs."

There were some suspicions in Muka's mind that the vampire settlement would have been attacked by them, but they weren't an established organisation. They didn't even have a base of sorts because they were always on the move.

Maybe that's why the tombs were spread all over the place? It just meant that for Muka to get her answer, she would have to get it from Erin herself.

"I promise you, my hatred for Zero grows as I think about everything he has done," Chris added. "Zero used me as an experiment. He turned me into this but did no such thing himself. I fell for his act, I was a fool to believe his words when he said he cared about me, but actions speak louder than words.

"It just took me a 1000 years to realise it."

The others felt quite sorry for Chris. They could realise, in some ways, as many of them in their own lives had felt like outcasts at one point and time. The only thing was many of them found each other and Quinn.

While Chris had found Zero, who took him down the wrong path.

"Let's work with him!" Minny shouted with a big smile. "I like him. He can be my Big Uncle or Muscle Uncle!"

Seeing Minny act like this and say those words, a smile formed on Chris' face.

"Alright, I have decided that we will work together. So the first thing I would ask is, what is your plan to stop Zero and Pure?"

Getting up from his seat, Chris walked past the table and to the other side of the room.Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

"That...the plan is quite simple. The Red Heart is still located here on this ship. We take it back. I think it's a lot safer in your hands than it is in his.

"Then the next part starts from here today and now. Destroy the lab, destroy the military facilities, and destroy everything that makes Pure a strong powerhouse. Right now, Zero is away, and the second strongest in Pure has decided to join your side, so what better time than now to cause some mayhem."

The others looked at each other, remembering Logan's words. That this was meant to just be a meeting, that they weren't to cause any trouble. However, the situation was something none of them had expected, and in unexpected times, sometimes they just had to go with their gut.

"Let's destroy this ship!" Peter smiled.
