Immortui, a figure that Quinn had heard a lot about, and someone that had been involved in his life in more ways than one, yet the two of them had never directly talked to each other.

There was no way to confirm that the one they were really talking to through Jared was Immortui, but Quinn could tell. Only a powerful celestial could do something like this to their followers.

He doubted this was something Magnus, another dedicated follower, could do.

"I know a lot about you." Quinn said. "I know about your past, and I know why you are locked up, and how there is a particular group that would like to keep it that way."

It wasn't that Quinn liked the celestials, heck, Immortui was a celestial himself, but it was almost as if he was chucked into the middle of this battle between the two groups, and to them it didn't matter how much those from Earth suffered.

"I see, then you should understand my desire to escape, and rightfully change the way things currently are. I'm sure you have felt it at times, that the way they deal with things isn't exactly fair." Immortui stated.

"You might not know it, but I have attempted to get out of my plane several times, yet each time I have tried, there have been things that have gotten in the way, and one of them is you Quinn.

"Regardless of whether you have done it on purpose or not, you have gotten in my way multiple times."

The energy was rising inside of Jared's body when he spoke these words, but the thick glass was keeping him back, at least they thought it was, since he hadn't attempted to break out.

"But you see, I am willing to forgive all of that. You, Quinn, have grown incredibly strong, stronger than any of those like you. The vampires, they came from me, they were a part of me, but you have gone beyond that, but you will never be able to get rid of that link, that you are a part of me.

"You have the power to free me, I know you do, and I know you know that as well."

Quinn's guess was right on the money, Immortui was now after him.

"I wouldn't be too sure about that, and even if I could, setting you free would just make me a target of those that sealed you away in the first place." Quinn answered.

"Ah yes, but it would be too late for them to find out, by then the two of us, as well as those that believe in our goal, would rise up against them."

"But you lost." Quinn said. "You lost last time, so what makes you think you can win this time?"

"The punishment they gave me, it was a blessing in disguise. I have become the grand ruler of this plane already. In this world, there are beings far more fierce than those on earth, and I rule over them all.

"More than that, demons made from my own blood, just like the vampires, have grown in this world full of fighting and death. It won't be a war, but a one sided massacre."

Quinn was sure that the celestials had to be aware of this, and he himself had gone against one of his demons. He had to admit that for normal vampires, they stood no chance. If the celestials hadn't acted, then they had to be confident that Immortui would be stuck where he currently was.

"Isn't there anything you want in this world‚Ä¶ someone you might have lost. I can bring them back. With my power, I can bring back those dear to you. The celestials, they don't care about any of your lives. They would rather have you all die, and for me to just never return, but at least I am offering you something you want."

Quinn's fist was starting to shake, and his eyes were glowing red in anger.

"You b*stard, half the people that I lost, that I care about, were lost because of conflicts that you caused! Making a deal with you, would be kicking the dead in the ground!"

The smile on Jared's face, that had been there the whole time had disappeared.

"I was being nice to you Quinn. I was giving you a choice, when in reality you have no choice. I tried to show you that even with this simple body, how easy it was for me to take away something you cared about.

"And even then, you are choosing to go against me? If you had chosen my side, then at least I would be helping you, but where are the celestials now? Where are they, will they be the ones that save your family?"

Grinding his teeth, Quinn had an answer.

"No, but you won't be either. All this time, I've been the one protecting them. Immortui. If you're trying to pick a fight with my family, then even if I have to come to you, I will do so and make sure to kill you, just like I have done everyone else so far."

It was clear now, this was Quinn's answer, he wasn't going to work for Immortui. That thought hadn't crossed his mind. He just wanted to live his life, and there was one last person that was stopping him from doing so.

"You threatened me! You threatened me!" Immortui shouted with the aura coming out of Jared once more. "No god has ever dared to do that! Even the Ancient Ones feared my power, were scared of angering me, but you act like you have no fear, but I can tell you're scared.

"In the past, I always focused on conflict. My attention was on growing my own power, you just happened to get in the way, but now, I will focus all of my attention on you.

"How many people do you care about Quinn? Do you care about this person's life as well, the one I'm controlling right now? This is a nobody and I nearly killed your daughter.

"For the rest of your life you will have to live in fear, fear that anybody could be your enemy, anybody could be me waiting around the corner, targeting all of the ones that you love, all of the ones that you care about.

"I will show you that you have made an enemy of the wrong person. I will show you how dangerous I can be, without even stepping a foot in your world."

Jared finally started to calm down, the aura around him starting to fade, but the eyes were still filled with white, still showing that Immortui was in control.

"How many can you save Quinn?" Immortui asked. "Well, let's find out."

Jared lifted his hand and all of the powerful aura went towards one point at his fingertip, with the finger he swiped it across his neck. His head fell to the floor, blood spilling everywhere. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

Jared was dead‚Ä¶ and it was one life Immortui had taken away, and one life Quinn was already unable to save.
