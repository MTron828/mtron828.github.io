Chapter 2395 ¬†Setting sun (Part 2)

Hikel could feel a headache coming on, because once again it felt like it was left to him to try and sort out who would be going with who. There were sensible and insensible ones and then those that just were more laid back.

"Alright‚Ä¶ so I think I got it sorted." Hikel said. "In the first place, Russ is unable to travel with Sil due to the Black sword. If he was to use its powers, then it would cancel the teleportation.

"So, for now we're split the group between those going with Sil and those staying with Russ. If that's the case, then it would be best to split up Peter and Russ, since them two seem to get along the worst together."

The two of them glanced at each other for a moment.

"I'm happy with that, I want to find Quinn as soon as possible."

"Make sure to cover yourself when you see him, you don't want to show him that you're too excited to meet him." Russ commented.

Standing in between the two was Chris, just before Peter could try anything.

"In terms of regrouping, me and Edvard can sense our energy relatively easily, and we can smell each other out. Of course, I don't think Sil will have a problem getting back to us, but just as a precaution, I think it's best if the two of us split up." Hikel explained.

With that, it was decided, Russ, Hikel and Chris would be staying put with one group, whiel Sil, Edvard and Peter would continue the search elsewhere.

After saying good luck to each other, they wasted no time. Sil gathered the two of them around him, and using his powers they Whether it would be a better or worse situation than what they were currently in, only time would tell.

were able to teleport out of the area they were in.

Whether it would be a better or worse situation than what they were currently in, only time would tell.

The three remaining hardly knew each other, with the others gone though it did feel a lot quieter but they didn't want to just sit back and do nothing. UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

"I guess that the champion that is guarding this place is unable to detect that people have left." Hikel commented. "Although, not many would have a teleport ability as strong as Sil's."

"What do you think's the best course of action?" Chris asked. "Should we attempt to break out of this place, or question more of the others to see if someone will talk.

"We could just wait until the sun goes down, that's when this hell event thing is meant to start." Russ said, thinking that the more time went on and passed, the more likely it was that this whole situation would resolve itself without needing him to do anything.

Thinking about the many possibilities the first thing they needed to do was scout the area. The room they were in was incredibly large, it felt like it was an area that could fit 1000's of people rather than the fifty or so that were in there.

On one end, there was a strange barrier of sorts, it was red in colour and they were unable to see what was on the other side, when looking at the floor though, they could see that multiple magic circles were on the ground right where the barrier was.

Letting out a little of Hikel's aura he tried to use it to get past or through the barrier but it wasn't working. It was hard to tell if a high level attack would allow them to break through the barrier in the first place.

After that the group went over to the other side, on this side, strangely there was a staircase that led up. It seemed to reach another floor, yet not a single person was heading up there.

While standing by the stairs, Chris started to sniff the air.

"You can smell it as well." Hikel said. "The smell of blood."

"Oh!" ¬†A voice said from behind. "You guys are still here, but I haven't seen your friends around. It can't be, don't tell me they went up the staircase."

The one speaking was the Chrono who had spoken to them before. They could tell because the eyes of this Chrono were a lot closer together compared to the others, a trait they were able to recognise.

"I thought I had already told you guys, that if you try to leave this place then the champion will stop you. I'm afraid your friends are already dead."

Just like before after saying those words, the Chrono walked away from them.

"Is it just me, or is talking to these beings incredibly frustrating?" Russ said. "I'm starting to agree more with Peter, with the suggestion that these guys can do with a good whacking."

Ignoring Russ' words, the others were now thinking what the best option was.

"Should all of us go up there, or maybe just one of us, to see just how strong this champion is?" Chris asked.

"I think I might have a better idea." Hikel said. "Why don't we use Russ' power, can't he conjure something to go up for us. It will allow us to see just how dangerous this place is, while letting us explore at the same time."

Russ didn't like the fact that his name was suggested and that he would perhaps need to do some work.

"Alright and what should I make. A Dalki, perhaps I should just have a copy of Quinn running around the place. That would cause them to have alarm bells ringing in their head."

It was a good point to make, they needed a figure that was strong enough to face the champion to test it at least, but one that wouldn't cause alarm. The reason their presence hadn't caused alarm seemed to be the fact that they were so confident in nothing getting in or leaving.

"You can use me." Chris said, pointing to his head. "A while back, me and Peter fought against these Chronos. They were working for the celestials and were incredibly strong. It took everything we had back then to take it out.

"Of course, we're stronger now, but even if we were to face it, I still think it would be a dangerous enemy."

Sighing, Russ didn't have any clever remarks or anything to try and dissuade them from this idea, because it was actually a good one.

"Alright, but this person better be as strong as you say they are, you better have had a good impression of them. Let's hope it's not because you're weak."

Using his powers, Russ entered into Chris' mind, it didn't take long after that for a figure to appear in front of them. It was like the other Chrono, only this one had a more menacing aura around it, and in its hands there were two katana style swords.

"Alright, let's make some noise."
