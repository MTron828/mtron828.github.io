The system message that Quinn could see now was one that he hadn't seen for a long time, and there were good reasons for this. The sun had always had an effect on vampires. It caused great pain if they were to stay in it and they were severely weakened by it as well.

To combat this weakness, the vampires created special rings that allowed them to stay in the sun for a certain amount of time, depending on the ring. They were made from a mixture of specific beast crystals while also using some knowledge of vampire magic.

A special circle would be created and would form the ring in a certain way for it to have such an effect. Since beast crystals over time were easier to collect, the higher tier rings that would be given to vampires had improved, and nearly all vampires were able to stay on a planet at least until it would be dark out without any effect.

Quinn though, didn't have any rings on his hands because he had given them away. This was because he had found that the sun no longer affected him. He could feel it when he had evolved to the vampire lord level.

Staying in the sun for a certain amount of time, he could somewhat build a resistance to it, to the point where it had no effect at all. It wasn't an easy task as there was a great amount of pain associated with doing this.

It was something that he would never put his children through which is why they had the best rings that they could get to protect them. However, once again when Quinn had evolved beyond that of a vampire lord, the sun had no effect at all.

Perhaps this was because he had transcended what a vampire exactly was. Either way, it was something that he didn't have to worry about, and to be honest most vampires no longer did.

Quinn had found that in the 1000 years before he had woken up that since vampires lived among humans, the rings they made were better quality and they were plentiful. Still, when Quinn lost his celestial form, it seemed his body was still in an evolved state, something that still was above a vampire lord in terms of an evolution.

His body wasn't affected by the sun at all.

With all of this, Quinn did always have a thought. Why did the sun affect a vampire's strength? It wasn't direct light, as other light sources didn't seem to have any effect at all. It wasn't the heat, otherwise fire would also be extremely effective against a vampire.

Although they did seem to have a more difficult time against heat, it didn't make them weaker.

The only thing that was certain was it was directly related to the sun. Maybe some type of energy that radiated off of it that affected vampires and right now Quinn was being affected once more.

'This phoenix's power, it has the power to completely terraform a planet, to the point where nothing can live on it anymore. That's some crazy strong power, does that mean that this beast has an energy that is similar to the sun?

'Is it affecting me, because of how close I am?'

It was the only thing Quinn could really think of. He didn't completely lose this weakness of his, it was just that the sun was incredibly far away. Whatever affected him no longer did at the distance it was, but he was quite literally now staring at a source of power similar to it.

The phoenix, after opening its eyes, was releasing waves of heat out from its body that were going through the air, and were hitting Quinn. The temperature felt like it almost doubled. Looking to his right, he wanted to see how well Mundus was dealing with the heat, but he was nowhere to be seen.

'That guy, well I know he will be out there somewhere waiting for me to take care of this thing‚Ä¶ first‚Ä¶ I should take a few steps back.'

Quinn moved back quickly, jumping from his position around fifty or so metres. The phoenix was now standing on its two fiery legs with its wings spread out wide. From this distance it looked large, it was quite clearly a gigantic creature, far bigger than any animal on earth, and roughly the same size as the dragon that had been used to create the Dalki.

'I see, so from a certain distance whatever is emitting from the 0hoenix doesn't affect me, and from the looks of things, the phoenix isn't moving from its spot, but standing up on its legs it looks like it's ready to attack at any moment.'

Quinn smiled as he saw this, even under the extreme pressure of fighting such a strong beast.

'I should see this as a good thing. The armour that will be created out of a beast like this. What effect will it have, will it allow me to create this level of heat for all those around me, or will it give the same effect to the other vampires as well.'

Either way, he needed to see himself just what the phoenix could do, and at a distance the best thing to use to hit the beast so far, with the blood guns. Pulling them out, he aimed carefully and started to fire away.

As usual Quinn would switch up the bullets that were used to see which one was most effective. The best thing about the guns were how versatile all the different bullets were and the fact that more types of bullets could be created.

When the blood bullets, Qi bullets, as well as others hit the phoenix though, it ruffled the flames slightly, but almost looked as if it went right through the phoenix's body. Similar to a real bullet just passing through flames.

The only bullet that was able to stick onto the flames was the shadow bullet which made a small mark and lingered for a few seconds before disappearing completely.

'These guns are starting to suck more and more.' Quinn said to himself.

'Hey don't blame the tools, but the idiot who is using them!' Alex complained back. 'Those guns are my best creation. It's not my fault that you're going up against a giant bird made of fire. Maybe I should have just made you a water pistol instead.'

Since the guns weren't working well, and he knew Mundus' skill allowed him to recover, he thought the best thing was to use his soul weapon, the Shadow mist. The only thing was, this distance was too great, so he needed to run in to use it.

Running ahead, Quinn could see the system message appearing once again.

[All stats have been lowered by 30 percent.]

There was a significant drop in his speed, but Quinn thought he had a counter as well.

[Shadow body has been activated]

[An energy is still affecting your body]T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

[All stats have been lowered by 10 percent]

'10 percent is a lot less than 30 percent, so I'll take it.'

Forming in Quinn's hands were two large blood spears. It was his mid-range attack that had power, because he feared something else, and he didn't want to find out in the middle of battle.

The problem was, the phoenix wasn't just going to stand there doing nothing. Moving its wing, a line of flames was seen going across the ground and it wasn't slow either. Immediately Quinn had to stop gathering his blood aura, and used his shadow to block the attack.

The flames had hit the shadow he had summoned but they continued to burn and weren't going away. It felt like if Quinn was to lower the shadow then the flames would continue.

So he decided to move to the side and continue running forward before letting the shadow drop and he was right. The line of flames continued reaching far across the land.

[All stats have been lowered by 20 percent]

'I was right, the closer I get to this bird, the worse I am affected by it and I'm still not close enough to use shadow mist.'

As expected, Mundus was watching the fight from the side, and had pulled up his normal throne to take a seat. While watching Quinn's strange actions and drop in speed, it didn't go unnoticed.

'What is happening to him, why is he getting weaker all of a sudden‚Ä¶ is it the heat? I honestly thought that this would have been one of the easiest opponents for him out of the ones I prepared.

'Could it be, have I managed to discover a weakness?' Mundus thought.
