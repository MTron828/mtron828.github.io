When thinking about the question that had been asked, Quinn wondered, what benefit would Jim gain from removing all memories of a certain individual. He understood himself, and from Layla being the leader of the Red vampires, Quinn understood her as well.

At first, Quinn thought of Layla, but that couldn't have been the case, because she was right next to him and by his side, but then Quinn started to think further. Russ, was currently on Earth and he had been relying all the information he could find back to them.

Yet, he stated that there was one group who he was unable to get any information at all on. It was the Blade family. Their powers could also be taken advantage of, and if they managed to get to one person in particular, then things were somewhat starting to make sense.

"I think I gave you enough time for you to have figured out the answer yourself." Logan finally spoke, he had been quiet for a while, it almost looked like the video had stopped, but he had simply just predicted how long it would take for Quinn to come to an answer.

"The person that was removed from everyone's mind was the one known as Sil. The strange thing is, the Blade family themselves are still something that is in everyone's mind, yet Sil is not.

"From the information I have, my wife is related to Sil yet she has no memory of him whatsoever. However, from asking her a set of questions, I was beginning to learn the power of the Blade family.

"With that, I managed to put two and two together. What if Sil managed to touch Malik? What would occur, would Malik change his memories at that point, equally wouldn't that mean that Sil had obtained his power?

"You see the Blade's power is limited to those that are human and although Malik has a god slayer power, he is certainly human. With Sil's power, using Malki's power as well as all the strongest abilities he has gathered, if he were to use the device that we created, then a mass change of memories is certainly possible."

Quinn was just imagining the amount of MC cells Sil would have, but worse of all, was the fact that if Sil was behind this, it meant that his memoires had changed as well.

'Wasn't Sil meant to go out exploring again? How did they manage to come across him? On top of that, even if they did come across him, how were they able to get close enough to touch him.

"I started to do some research, along with Vincent, to find out what had occured. Luckily, Jim and Jack seem to have too much faith in these memory changing abilities. The Blade ship was easy to find, and there was even footage that I was able to recover.

"If I simply told you what had occured, it would be difficult to believe or comprehend. Which is why I have set up a simulation for you of the events that happened that day. Once the video ends, my little spider will plug into your ship's mainframe and give you coordinates to a certain location.

"It's to a beast planet, the coordinates will send you to a place where there is next to no life, but buried in the ground is a teleporter. Once you input these numbers, 5,6,2,4,7,7,9, the teleporter will activate. As for its location, it will be Earth.

"The teleporter will take you to one of the Green Family bases, in a canyon. No one knows about this other than I. There you will find out what happened to Sil, and from there you can communicate with me, and tell me your next move."

With that the video had ended and the spider was doing exactly as it said it would.

"Are we heading back to Earth then?" Layla asked.

"Of course we are." Quinn snapped back. "We need to find out what happened to Sil. If Logan thinks it's important for us to find out, then it has to be something big."

"But then, why didn't he tell us in the video? It's dangerous to go back to Earth with the way things are, even with Logan's set up."

"Then what do we do?" Quinn asked.

The room was filled with silence, as Layla didn't have an answer for that.

The spaceship was currently on autopilot, and rather than argue with Quinn, Layla had decided to look after the kids while trying to calm them down. She would try her best to explain what was happening and what they were going to do, even though she still wasn't too sure herself.

As for Quinn, he couldn't stop thinking about how they had managed to get Sil.

'If what Logan is saying is true, and Sil was the cause of the mass memory change, it would mean they would have had to have gotten close to him.

'Did Sil lose a fight, but how, he is as strong as me and in some cases I would say stronger. There's Ray, if it was him then maybe he could have been the one to beat Sil. Or perhaps it was Sil that beat Ray, but no, then that still wouldn't make sense.'

No matter how Quinn went about it, the fact that both Sil and Ray had their memories changed meant one of them had to have lost a fight or have been tricked.

'I guess, we'll find out soon.'

Back in the vampire settlement, it had been a while since Quinn and the others had escaped. Since Muka, and those that were along with her had seen it first hand, they had reported this to the others.

The search had been called off, and they had failed at their task. Currently, all of them were at an Inn to gather around a table. All of those that had failed at stopping Quinn from escaping.

"We can't be down forever about it." Fex said, as he lifted up his class. "And besides, they didn't seem that dangerous to me."

"And you would know what dangerous is?" Xander replied. "Didn't you hear the news that's coming from the Namrik planet? He attacked the original leaders!"

"Yes, but how did one manage to get from there to here so fast, that doesn't make any sense." Muka added.

"A lot of things haven't been making sense lately." Fex took a big chug of his drink. "You know, over the course of time, I would say that I have gotten quite good at reading others' facial expressions.

"When he said those words up there. When he called me blood brother, I could tell it was painful for him. If the reports are true about what he did on the Namrik planet, then at any time he could have killed us.

"It would have been the safer option to leave no witnesses, and yet he didn't."

Xander slammed the table with his hand at that point.

"Don't tell me you actually believe what he said. That's what he wanted to do, to put doubts in our heads and you are falling right for their trap."

"Well, there is one way to find out." Muka said. "We have all been through a lot with Jim, but lately he has been distant with us. If we were to ask to meet with him, and talk about a few things, wouldn't we be able to confirm if what this person said is true or not."

The other two didn't say anything, because it was a crazy suggestion in the first place, but they both did have a small itch nagging them to find out.Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

As the three were talking, running in from outside was one of the vampires, as they were shouting about a commotion outside. A loud sound could be heard of jets rumbling and the whole settlement was slightly shaking.

As the three went outside and looked toward the sky they could see one of the Marpo Cruise ship's had returned, but it wasn't one with Jim Eno on board, it was one with Jack Truedream instead.
