Chapter 1081 - All together

The first one to throw an attack out against the Dalki was Chris. He swung both his blades out to the side, unlocking all of the links, extending his weapon. It then laid there flat on the ground like a snake. Lifting them high into the air, he then slammed them down onto the Dalki.

Chris didn’t need to move his arms much, for he could control and change the blade’s trajectory with his own Qi. He could also use this to extend and shorten his weapons at will. All of his attacks at the moment, he was pushing his Qi to the limit, not holding back.

Three of the weapon’s teeth sank into the either side of the Dlaki’s shoulder, digging in, oozing the green blood, and both of the Dlaki’s feet sank a few inches into the ground.

Seeing this as an opportunity, Leo leapt close towards the Dalki, ready to strike at its head.

’It seems like this red haired man doesn’t know that we need to kill it in one shot, otherwise it will just get stronger!’ Leo thought.

Ovin, the black cat, also had leapt onto Leo’s heads and started powering up and looking for the right opportunity.

"Careful!" Chris shouted. "My weapons are stuck in him, and I think he got hit on purpose."

Chris was trying his best to pull back his weapons so the teeth could rip the area of his shoulders. However, the Dalki was holding onto part of the weapon, and the two of them were in a battle of strength.

’Ha, I never thought someone would actually beat me in a battle of strength like this. Especially a damn lizard.’ "It just means I have to use more power!" Chris shouted as he yanked the chains, and viable energy could be seen leaping from his skin, he was covered in a strange yellow energy.

The teeth on the weapons had moved a few inches, but that was all as the Dalki pulled on them again. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

"Weak!" The dalki said as it bent its knees, ready to do something.

Ovin seeing this, let out a mighty bark once more, producing visible sound waves that would ripple through the air. This one was much louder and fierce than the one before.

’I bet they’ve never felt something like this before!’ Ovin proudly said. ’Use this chance while he’s stunned, to take him out!’

It was true, the Dalki could feel it, and Chris could suddenly pull out his chains as they continued to rip through the Dalki’s body but then the Dalki had tilted it’s head back and when it threw his head forward an almighty roar came out. It was nearly twice the strength of what Ovin had produced. Ovin’s yellow mist started to shrink, as if a sign that the Cat was afraid.

’Me, afraid of this. I’m one of the great kings of the familiar world! Damn him!’

Even for Leo, he was frozen slightly in place. His mind was clear, and unafraid, but it was human instinct, when hearing something that menacing, to not proceed any further. The Dalki grabbed the weapons before they had retracted back to Chris, and then lifted them up in the air along with Chris.

The Dalki turned back to the bald man, but he was no longer there. The next second the Dalki could see something coming towards its neck. It lifted it’s arm, and a large slash of red aura had pierced it’s hard-scaled skin.

"You’re fast, too fast for a human!" The Dalki said. "It can’t be, why would the two of you be working together!" The Dalki was about to hit Leo with it’s other arm when it felt another strike hit it from the other side, this one slightly yellow in colour.

It wasn’t as strong as the first one, but it still managed to damage its scales somewhat. When he turned to look, he could see a female with black hair holding a giant sword. Leo could sense Erin coming, but it was never part of his plan, he continued to attack with his sword in different places.

Hitting parts of his leg’s and more, and Erin also charged in from the other side, doing the same. She had improved greatly, faster than she was before, faster than she had been in any type of training, and she was avoiding every one of Dalki’s blows.

’She took off the suppression, has it made her even stronger, it’s almost like she’s a completely different person. Perhaps, she’s...evolved.’ Leo thought, but he had to focus on the battle in front of him.

A few hits from a Dalki with this much strength, and both of them weren’t sure how much they could recover. What Leo was surprised about was how fast the Dalki was moving, even able to keep up with the vampire’s speed. Leo was only faster by a little bit, and it would always protect it’s vital points.

Getting up from the broken seats in the stands, Chris could see what was going on. Suddenly, a new girl had joined and was fighting as well. Even the cat could be seen leaping and giving it a few swipes.

They are all so fast, and what’s this yellow and red aura coming off from them? Concentrating, Chris tried to sense something and though he wasn’t quite sure what the girl’s energy was, he could feel Leo’s energy even from here.

’It’s just like that boy, Quinn. They’re using that same energy to fight. Do they know each other?’ Chris thought.

The next second, the Dalki curled up into a ball, and suddenly wings sprouted out from it’s back. It coverd both sides of the attacks from Erin and Leo. Then flapped them with strength, pushing back their swords, and causing them both to go slightly off balance.

At that moment, the Dalki stretched its long limbs, hitting both of them at the same time.

’I thought I had improved, I thought we could beat this thing, but that fist is so fast!’ Erin thought as she mustered all her will to pull her large blade in front of the attack. When it hit, the blade immediately broke in half, and she was sent flying into the arena wall.

As for Leo, Ovin could see what was about to happen.

’I can’t let you lose this fight! My partner still has a d.e.s.i.r.e he needs to achieve! Leo, I will give up here, let me leave you with one parting gift!’

Ovin leapt in front of the fist, and then turned into bright yellow flames surrounding the Dalki’s arm. The heat was so immense that the Dalki’s hand was dissolving in seconds and Dred had no choice but to cut it off from the top of his shoulder to stop the flames.

The flames had stopped, and Dred flew up into the air with his wings, hovering above the arena, blood dripping down to the ground from his wounds, while Ovin was nowhere to be seen.

Chris had leapt up from the arena floor and landed near Leo’s side. His body was quite bruised, but he mostly looked fine.

"Who would have thought that bastard could fly. I guess they look like dragons so it would make sense for some of them to have wings." Chris said. "Sorry about your beast, it looks like it sacrificed itself in that attack."

Although Ovin was gone, he would return, for familiars, never died once attached, but he wouldn’t be able to be summoned for a while.

"You’re strong, your Qi is the sharpest I’ve ever seen. It’s no wonder you could do all those attacks." Chris said. "But there’s a big problem, your weapon is a piece of crap. Who is using a king tier weapon in a fight against a four spiked Dalki. You can only hurt that thing because of your sharp Qi otherwise that thing would be useless."

Leo gripped the hilt of his sword tighter.

"It may seem useless, but this has the will of my fallen comrades inside, the ones that were killed by the Dalki. They will not let me down no matter what, each strike will be stronger as we get closer to killing it."

Breaking their conversations, a large bang was heard form the wall as rocks went flying into the air, and Erin was seen coming out with her fangs baring out, something that hadn’t happened before, and now she was looking straight towards Leo, rather than the Dalki itself.

She went from one side of the arena to nearly to the other in an instant, and Leo had no choice but to activate his soul weapon for her speed was unexpected as she thrust her other katana style blade.

With his soul weapon, he could force her strike to miss.

"Dman, what the hell is happening." Chris said as he had leapt off to the side. "I thought she was on our side? Did the Dalki do that."

Right now, Leo and Erin were locked in combat, leaving only Chris on his own, but as he looked at the Dalki up in the air, he couldn’t help but feel that with it’s missing arm and the other two having already done too much, he could at least finish it off for them.

"Do me a favour, just don’t kill me after this okay." Chris yelled over, directing it at Leo.

"I have no choice, I’m going to have to use the fourth stage!"
