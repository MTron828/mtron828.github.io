Chapter 1050 - The Blue Fang Armour

The legendary tier equipment that had been created by Alex and was a gift from Helen, all the pieces had been put on. All armour pieces were created using the same beast crystals from a legendary tier beast, called the Blue Arctic Wolf. Found on a plane covered in snow.

Usually, beast crystals could only be used to create one piece of equipment that, that type of crystal was suited to, but the Arctic Wolfs crystals were unique. It could be turned into any part including different weapons. Unfortunately, what this meant was that the stats that came with it weren’t so specialised, or so this is what people assumed.

The legendary equipment created with the Arctic Wolf crystals wasn’t on par with other legendary tier items but was highly sought after due to its adaptability. Legendary tier beasts were, after all, hard to come by, so finding one that could be turned into anything was seen as a big advantage to have.

However, when creating the crystal, Alex was able to uncover something else. The reason why the Arctic wolf crystals could be turned into anything, and he didn’t seem to be the first one either. He wondered why the Daisy faction had gathered so many of the same beast legendary tier crystals, without using them to turn into anything else.

Hoping to find something, Alex created two different sets of armour with the Arctic Wolf crystals and when he created his second one, he understood. The Arctic wolf equipment was meant to be used as a set. An armour set that would have a special active ability for one to use.

With the armour equipped, Quinn could feel the effects of each item as the power of the beast equipment entered his body, improving his overall stats. Even though the legendary tier items were said not to be on par with others, it was still a huge improvement from what he was wearing.

[Blue Arctic Wolf C.h.e.s.t piece: +20 to all stats]

[Defence: 40]

[Blue Arctic Wolf Shoulder pieces: +10 to all stats]

[Defence: 20]

[Blue Arctic Wolf leg pieces: + 30 stamina]

[Blue Arctic Wolf boots + 30 agility]

[Defence 20]

Although the defence that each of the items gave was less than the emperor tier he had received from Alex before, that didn’t matter for how great the equipment had improved his stats. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

[Strength: 70 (100) ]

[Agility: 70 (130) ]

[Stamina: 69 (129) ]

[Charm: 60 (90) ]

It was the first time Quinn’s stats had reached such numbers.

’This is what can happen with a full set of legendary tier equipment? And I also have the mask as well.’ Quinn thought, as he couldn’t imagine how much stronger he would be with Demi-god tier or Demon tier equipment.

However, he saw the chaos back there, and he needed to deal with this beast fast. He would have no time for training sessions.

Equipping the red demon-like mask, Quinn was ready.

When the beast was finally in view, Quinn could see coming through the forest was another Moth like creature. It too was covered in fur, only this time it was purple in colour. The trees were the only thing slowing it down as it hit them away, but that’s when Quinn noticed something strange.

He could see that when the creature would hit the plants with its fur, and it would rub off onto the plants, it would slowly start to weather away.

’That fur, I have to try to keep it off me." Quinn said.

When the beast got closer, something seemed to come off from it, small particles of fur, even without intentionally spreading it. it was walking and constantly shedding its skin, creating the air around it to turn purple. Small fibres that were nearly invisible had already entered the air.

[Estimated time till death: 5 minutes]

"As if I didn’t have a good enough reason already to try and defeat this thing quickly," Quinn thought.

Now he was sure what the right thing to do was. To activate the set armour ability.

[Activating: The Blue fang Armour set]

[Skill activated: Nitro accelerate]

All the energy that Quinn had felt from the boost in wearing the equipment was suddenly going into a different area. He could feel the energy moving around, as the set of silver armour started to light up, in a shining blue.

Looking at his stats, there was a drastic change that proved that the active skill had worked.

[Agility: 220]

For one, the active ability would only last a total of two minutes, the second was after the skill was activated, it would be on a one hour cooldown. During this cool-down period, all the stats the equipment usually gave was nullified. It was like he was just wearing pieces of scrap metal during the cool-down period.

This didn’t matter so much for Quinn though, because with his shadow equip skill, during the cool-down period while mid fight he could change his armour. Something that wasn’t an option for him. The disadvantage of using such a powerful skill has been negated like that.

Quinn’s health was already deteriorating, but he wanted to kill the beast before even the time had run out. He charged forward, moving his legs, and everything around him started to look like a blur. Through focusing, he was finally able to see things, but it took a lot of mind power. The beast couldn’t even keep track of where Quinn was, nor could he himself, as he had accidentally run straight past the beast, colliding into a tree, but breaking it in the process.

"Crap!" Quinn thought as he brushed a few branches of himself, and looked at the back of the beast. "I can’t just use my body’s full speed just yet, but I can still control it, so I’ll just have to get used to it slowly."

Charging at the beast a little slower this time, Quinn had punched one of the beast’s legs, using a blood spray filled fist. It had torn off part of the beast skin but hadn’t created a wound. As expected one would think a Demi-god tier beast couldn’t be taken down with one blow, but while he was like this. That didn’t matter.

He punched at one of the many Moths’ legs multiple times using his full strength, and the faster his hits were, the stronger they would be as well. When the Moth eventually turned around, Quinn had already ran underneath it going for the next one.

The Moth screamed in pain and anger. Its purple fur was being thrown about everywhere, even attaching itself to Quinn. His health was still deteriorating and he could see the timer on his quest going down.

’It’s poison must be strong. I can see why it’s a Demi-god tier beast. I bet if it was fighting against anyone else, it would have poisoned and killed them in seconds. But vampires seem to have a better resistance, and with my Blood bank I can continue on for a lot longer, regaining my energy!’

Quinn Slid underneath the Moth’s belly, and jumped before hammering both elbows into one of the Moth’s eyes. Three of the beast legs had already been destroyed, including one of its eyes now. The beast truly felt like it could do nothing.

Its poison wasn’t working, and Quinn was strong enough to continue to use his speed and skills to his advantage. Getting behind to its next leg, Quinn then proceeded to produce his well learnt t.h.i.g.h kick.

The first kick didn’t work as it slammed the beast, but it had a clear effect as its body wobbled. Not giving it time to recover, producing five in succession, the last kick had snapped the leg and sent it flying through the forest.

’This is great. I don’t even have to use my blood abilities or shadow powers. This armour has just given me another way to fight!’ Quinn thought excitedly.

However, his time was running out with the active skill, and his other set of equipment wasn’t exactly the best at the moment. If he didn’t finish off the beast in two minutes, then it would have been better for him to not use the skill at all.

Knowing this, Quinn could see the beast was mostly crippled. He leapt onto the beast’s head and stood strong. It swung its large body in an attempt to swing what was on its head off. Quinn raised his hand, and blood started to gather around it, flowing down from his fingertips down to his elbow. Soon it started to spiral like a type of drill, covering a single arm.

It was one of the blood moves he had learnt from Eno himself. Mixing this in with his already known Hammer strike. Quinn was able to create a new move. He started the motions slamming into the beast head. Using Qi that force alone was enough to jolt the beast, then pulling his arm and snapping it forward, the Blood hammer drill had been executed.

Slamming the drill into the beast head, a loud bang was heard and the blood drill was able to pierce through it easily. Creating a large hole in its head and even going through to the ground. A few seconds later and the beast had instantly stopped moving, and had fallen to the floor.

At that moment, the famous ding was heard in his head, and the blue armour on his body started to dim once again.
