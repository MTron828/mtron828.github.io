All three had teleported right into the center of the cave again. Appearing in the air just a few centimeters above before landing on the ground, and almost immediately Sil went to sit down by the wall to rest. 

He was trying his best to rest as much as possible in between these sessions of gathering people, and he had an idea of what was to come, having been through it all once before.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Shinto stood up looking around the cave, and the first one to catch his attention out of them all was Pultra who was standing above a person with her hands laid on top of his head. 

"Pultra is here as well!" Shinto said. "Calva, why didn't you say anything about getting her to agree." 

"You didn't exactly give me the time to say anything. You were pretty obsessed with getting rid of us from the get go." Calva answered. 

A little embarrassed by that, Shinto cleared his throat. The situation was already far better than he had imagined since she was here as well. 

"I'm happy that they managed to convince you, with you by our side, our chances continue to increase." Pultra said. 

Shinto didn't reply straight away to that, because he felt there was still a little convincing to go. He needed to observe just who the rest of these helpers were. Looking around the room, they all gave a little friendly nod, but no one said anything to Shinto. 

"I recognize some of you, some of you were in the pit." Shinto said, looking toward Hikel and Chris. Although he was focused on his own fight mainly with Hikel that fact that the one called Chris was still alive after going against Unzoku was proof of his strength,

"Yes." Hikel said. "We know your strength well, and I imagine you should know ours by now. Everyone here has equal or greater power than each other. The important thing is, that none of us will slow each other down, and we can all help each other in achieving our goal." 

The three Skullys hearing those words looked at each other, and decided to take a step back away from the group, because they knew that didn't include them. 

"I see… but all of you, you aren't from here are you?" Shinto asked. "Are you from a different space? How did you get in here, was it the celestials that sent you?" 

Shinto remembered the conversation that he had with Unzoku, about how the celestials had taken his brother and eventually met his end. He had claimed these people were the same. 

"The celestials didn't send us." Hikel answered. "We came following after him." Hikel pointed to Quinn on the table. "He went through a portal from our world to reach yours, all with the goal of taking out Immortui, and we couldn't leave him alone."

There were a lot of questions on Shinto's mind, a lot of them about his brother. Since one of them could summon him, had they met him before? Did they know about his brother, was he really dead? Instead though, he decided that at this point and time, it wasn't the time to be selfish, people were relying on him and he needed to focus on what was ahead.

"Then let me ask you another question, is there a way for you to get back?" Shinto asked. 

The one question that never got brought up between the group, because right now they had no way back. The only thing they had was the Boneclaw, but he had used up energy from all the familiars in his world, all the energy he had been saving up for a long time. It was almost impossible to rely on him. 

"There's a reason I'm asking." Shiinto said. "At the moment, you guys have a hit list out for you. It appears that Unzoku and the other demon kings know of your presence, but Unzoku was told something in particular. 

"He told me because he thought… there was no way I would betray him." 

Shinto might have been a bigger goldmine than they thought, he was a person that was on the inside information for them, since he had been working with the group. 

"They're looking for you guys, for a way to get out. If you managed to get in somehow, they thought you would know the answer to getting out. As for the others I don't know if they know about them yet… and there's more." 

Shinto went on to describe what the current situation with the pit was. Although he had been put on guard and they had created a new holding area for the participants. When night had come, none of the werewolves were sent down. 

Shinto didn't know much apart from that it seemed like Unzoku was preparing for something, putting the two and two together along with everything they had heard, as well as what the Yaks were doing, they were ready for a full out war.

"If we had never closed that portal, and they had managed to get through, what would the state of our world have been like?" Edvard said, thinking back.

"We stopped them already, so we can stop them again." Hikel added. "What I'm more concerned about, is the fact that they know about us, and not only is Immortui out there searching for us, but so are the other demon kings. How are we meant to get their blood, is our only option really to just fight them, try to kill them as quickly as possible." 

The situation had become more serious and suddenly now that everyone had gathered, they had to think about taking on the demon kings. The idea of defeating someone like Unzoku instantly, felt like a dream. 

"Quinn is still not awake, I was hoping if we had him he would be able to help but it looks like we have no choice." Sil said. "I have a plan. I didn't want to use up my MC cells just in case I needed to fight but as long as you guys can create a big enough distraction for me, then I can touch them." 

Everyone fell silent for a moment, so what if he could touch them, what did Sil even mean by that?

"Sil, I think you need to explain a little more." Edvard nervously said. 

"Oh sorry, if I can touch them, then I can change their memories. I'm not sure how effective it will be, considering most of them are just creatures who like to kill and hunt for fun. I have no doubt if they felt their boss or leader was weaker for them for a moment they would try to kill him, but that's all we need. 

"If I can change their memories to forget about Immortui. To forget about the others, it will give us enough of a chance to take their blood and get out of there." 

It was a resort that Sil really didn't want to rely on. It was a god slayer level ability, so it used up a bit of his MC points and getting close was dangerous. 

"Then I guess that's it then." Chris said, turning around. "We go to face the demon king. Will it be the king of the Yaks first. If he clears his memory then then we won't have to worry about them finding out about the ones I got rid of." 

Everyone nodded in agreement that it was the best choice. Sil wanted to wait a little to recover more of his MC cells before going to battle, when his eyes suddenly widened, and a sweat broke down the side of his face. 

"What's wrong?" Hikel asked. "Your heartbeat, it started to beat faster."

Sil turned to look at Pultra and Quinn. 

"You might have to stay with Quinn, because we need him to be awake as soon as possible." Sil said. 

At that moment, everyone's heart sank deep into their stomach, a dreaded feeling came over them all. 

"Immortui, he's onto us, he killed the first clone."
