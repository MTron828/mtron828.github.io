Due to the explosion, more Amra were starting to gather, and started to stand behind Geo. Some of them were of the Sedi rank, far bigger than the normal Amra, around twice the height. It was what the challengers would need to face to pass the 50th level of the tower.

At the same time, the elite force of vampires were starting to gather behind Hikel and Bianca. They had been busy getting the injured vampires out of the area and moving them out of the way. In this group, there were quite a few that were also noble vampires.

It appeared as if a large-scale battle was going to occur, one that would wipe out either side.

"Everyone‚Ä¶ get away from this area." Geo stated. "Support the other groups and make sure that they don't progress further."

Hikel had heard the orders of the other man, and had decided to do the same.

"Everyone, spread out, clear the area. I don't want anyone to be caught up in this mess."

The vampires listened and quickly disappeared, trusting in their fellow leaders.

'These two vampires are confident, but I have to be confident in taking them out as well. Nock is probably locked in combat as well, but there aren't enough of us, so I have to finish this fast.' Geo thought.

Geo's four arms started to glow golden once again as the celestial power was running through his body. Moving from his position, the rubble kicked up behind him and he appeared right next to Hikel.

Swinging his four arms, Geo wanted the first hit to cause a large amount of damage, but Hikel had jumped back using his fast speed. Geo was ready to give chase, as he wasn't going to let him get out of his sight, until a red glow appeared underneath his feet.

'When did he‚Ä¶'

Both of Hikel's hands had been cut, and while standing there his blood was dripping onto the floor, he had predicted what Geo would do, allowing him to trap him. A large explosion went off underneath Geo's foot. The whole ground shook and dust clouds from the debris of the buildings that had fallen had been made.

Coming straight out of it though, was Geo, who was unharmed.

'That was a direct hit with my ability and his body is still not harmed. Both I and Bianca have already taken the green blood. The opponent is a lot stronger than we thought.'

Creating a red blood claw, blood aura started to harden around the entire of Hikel's arm, at the same time, his real blood was being pushed through, and coated the outside of his hardened blood aura finger tips.

Throwing his hand out, Hikel had hit Geo's fist with his finger tips, and used his blood explosion power. The blood had touched Geo's physical body and when it exploded it had pushed Geo back.

However, Geo had more than one arm, and Hikel was only able to hit one of the arms, getting clipped by another one that hit Hikel in the stomach and sending him flying off.

Blood poured out of his mouth, as Hikel managed to catch himself in the air, and stopped skidding across the ground.

'That attack managed to have some effect, and with my blood aura hardening, I can protect my own arm from my own ability, but there is a limit, and my own power will eventually affect me using it like that.

'But that's not even the biggest worry, a single hit from that alien, and I feel like my whole insides have been ruptured.'

Hikel's body was repairing itself as the originals had great healing capabilities, but there was something about the energy in the attack that was causing Hikel to heal slower than compared to other attacks.

'This energy‚Ä¶ it's hard to even extract it from my body.'

"Bianca, don't get hit by him!" Hikel shouted, trying to focus on removing the energy.

"I never intended to!" Bianca shouted back as the snake around her neck fired out the acid toward Geo. Lifting up two of his arms he blocked the acid, and nothing had happened.

'This is acid from a demon tier beast, and it went through the other alien's skin just fine. Why is this one so different?'

Regardless, Bianca continued forward and when two of Geo's arms went towards her, she hit them from underneath with her blood palm strike, causing both of Geo's arms to be lifted. After that with both of her arms she thrust them right toward the centre of Geo hitting him cleanly in the stomach, but his position didn't move.

Stomping his foot on the ground, a wave of energy released and could be seen as cracks through the floor. The area where Bianca was standing lit up completely. Rising from the ground, the entire area was covered with energy that had come from Geo.

Bianca was seen having escaped the attack as she had jumped to the side, but she had been hit on her foot. Just like Hikel stated, her leg wasn't healing like it normally would. She knew this would slow her down and it was possible that Geo would finish her off.

The snake that was around her neck, was flung out, and its size started to grow. It soon turned into a giant python that was the size of five houses stacked on top of each other. Opening up its mouth, it went to bite down on Geo.

"I have dealt with plenty of beasts of this size!" Geo said, as he grabbed the top and lower jaw of the giant python, and lifted it in the air, slamming it onto the ground behind him. Its whole body bounced off the ground. It had been hit so hard but the Python was strong.

On the floor, it swirled its tail like a whip, aiming to hit Geo, but lifting his leg up he had kicked it back. The tail swung back outward and had hit Bianca away who was struggling to move.

"I'll kill that rock bastard!" Bianca screamed, as she got up, her leg only getting a little better.

Now from three different points there was Hikel, Bianca and the giant Python.

'Even us two original vampires are unable to take on this one alien, how many are there that are like him on this planet.' Hikel thought.

Unaware that there was only one, even though two more had received celestial energy from Quinn. Geo had already evolved as an Amra before that, when witnessing the battle of Quinn and Sil against Athos.

"It seems you guys might need a little more help." A voice said, as a man dressed in green clothing had appeared.

"Usually I would scorn when I see your face, but it is a bit of a delight today, Magnus." Hikel stated.

Magnus Muscat had arrived, the 6th family leader, and one of the previous Kings. On top of that, his partner, Wallace Dawn, the 7th leader, had also arrived.

"Based on what we have seen, you are the leader of these aliens." Magnus stated. "So if we get rid of you, I wonder what the morale of your people will be like."

Although Geo was quite comfortably winning the fight against two of the Original leaders, he knew their strength, and fighting four of them at the same time would be quite the tall task.

"I guess the good thing is, if you guys are here, then it means that you aren't out there hurting my people." Geo smiled.

Out of all of them, the first one to move was the giant Python. While Geo had to attack it, they would all go in with their strongest attacks to do the most damage they possibly could.

Geo knew this, and he wondered if he should charge forward to attack, that was until a figure had swooped down from above, and with its large talons it had stabbed the centre of the giant snake in its body. The snake was swirling around, and then with its large head it opened its razor sharp mouth and started to bite down on the snake.

The sudden appearance of another enemy had caused the others to stop, and the next second it had lifted the snake up and threw it off far in the distance towards where the other vampires were. It was done with the beast, and soon landed right by Geo's side.

"Is that an Owl? A large beast, but why is it helping them!" Bianca thought.

Looking at the beast there was something strange about it, Hikel could see there were strange lingering shadows coming off from the beast.
