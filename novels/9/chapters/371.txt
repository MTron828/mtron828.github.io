Chapter 372 Tell you everything

The ball of energy could be felt swirling around in his body. The first day when practising Quinn was able to remember what Leo had taught him and what he had felt that day. Just as he promised, he practised it every morning, and he was currently sitting on top of his bed in a mediating position, crossed legged.

Vorden didn‚Äôt ask what Quinn was doing, but just assumed that he must have been under a lot of stress lately and was just trying out a few things to let that stress out of him.

Breathing in deeply, he could see the ball of energy. Before, it was the size of a ping pong ball, but now it had grown to the size of a tennis ball. Each day it seemed to be growing in size as he managed to gather and control more Qi around his body. The next step was moving it around into the different parts, and this was the tricky part.

Moving the energy from his fingertips to his toes is what Leo had told him to do. Thus, if he wanted the Qi to naturally enhance his entire body, he would have to flatten the ball so that the energy spread out all over the body. It was clear that he had a long way to go, but he also had no clue whether or not he was improving fast or slow. Still, he decided to trust Leo. It only took him thirty minutes to practice each morning, anyway.

‚ÄôFex‚Äô Quinn thought.

The next step was getting stronger. He now had a time frame, and it was far shorter than he had first thought. Realistically, he didn‚Äôt know how big the vampire world was, or how long it would take to save Fex. He couldn‚Äôt just leave his training up until the very last day. They also needed to spend some time in the vampire world, too.

So realistically in Quinn‚Äôs head, rather than having two months to save Fex, he would only have one for the actual training.

With just his daily tasks and playing the VR game, his exp gaining was extremely slow. So if he wasn‚Äôt able to level up, then there was only one thing he could do to get stronger in such a short amount of time, that was consuming blood.

‚ÄôI know Fex said I‚Äôll get addicted the more times I drink blood, but that doesn‚Äôt really matter right now. I can always wean myself off of it later. I know it will be tough, but I really have no choice.‚Äô Follow the latest novels ùíêùíè nùíê/velbin(.)com

After Quinn was done with his normal lessons, he made his decision. He thought about how he could get many different types of blood easily, he also knew a certain person who could help him with that.

"Hm, of course, I can help you with that," Logan said in his usual chair, while getting a massage from his mechanical spider arms. "But before I help you, I want you to tell me why. And no more lies Quinn. We‚Äôve already decided to go to the vampire world together."

Quinn‚Äôs plan was to raid the city‚Äôs hospital. Not the school‚Äôs one, but the actual hospital located near the plaza centre that all soldiers had access to. They had been there once before, but the only problem Quinn had at the time was the cameras. After seeing what Logan could do, and what he had done at the base event, it should be easy work for Logan. On top of that, Quinn also had his shadow cloak that would be able to hide him in the darkness. As long as they did this at night, and the cameras were turned off, there would be no evidence of any culprit who could have done such a thing.

"Fex‚Äôs sister came to me last night," Quinn said.

As soon as he said these words, Logan‚Äôs mechanical arms that were giving him a massage all lifted in the air, as if they were shocked and reacting to how Logan was feeling.

"I know, apparently, they have some type of council there, and she came to tell me about their decision with Fex."

"With Fex, not Peter?"

Quinn shook his head.

"I don‚Äôt know about Peter, but as for Fex, they‚Äôve decided to give him a public execution."

Logan wasn‚Äôt as surprised with the verdict of the vampires as Quinn was. The reason being, Vordne had asked Fex a question at the time before he had left, and his answer wasn‚Äôt something that gave him confidence. Perhaps Fex already knew that there was a chance of this happening.

"Okay, so I understand that, but what does that have to do with going to the hospital?" Logan asked.

"The truth is, I get stronger from every different blood type I consume. So far there have been no restrictions that I know of. Different blood types support me in different ways. I can get physically stronger, faster, and a few other benefits as well."

Thinking about what Quinn had just said, Logan was a little horrified. How many humans existed on the campus alone, how many humans in the entire existence existed. If what he was saying was true. At some point Quinn‚Äôs strength would be unmatched, he would become a Vampire god.

"Are there other vampires like this?" Logan asked, now having slight second thoughts if this was the case.

"No, it seems to be special and related to my system."

"Alright, I‚Äôll help you Quinn, of course I will. We won‚Äôt waste anytime, What you‚Äôve told me has only given me more strength to work. I have been working on some new suits for myself. I‚Äôm not so na√Øve as to believe that we won‚Äôt get in any scuffles while there. Oh, and while we‚Äôre at it." Logan quickly went over to his specially designed fridge, honestly, Quinn didn‚Äôt know what to call it, but that was the closest thing he had in his head. From the fridge, he pulled out what looked like a small bottle of spray.

It was a dark red colour, which he then proceeded to spray it all over his body without saying a word. But as soon as he did, Quinn knew exactly what he had done.

"It works! You actually made it work!" Quinn said in excitement.

"For now, I can only make the smell last for up to an hour, which is a bit of a problem, I think. I can make it last a bit longer, but I can‚Äôt get it to work as a permanent solution." The look on Logan‚Äôs face was now serious. "Quinn, you need to start being more open to us, not just to me but everyone. If you had told me this sooner, then I could have probably made something to disguise the vampire smell, from both you and Peter. As I said before, I know you don‚Äôt want us to get involved, but we already are."

Quinn didn‚Äôt reply, but he understood that he wasn‚Äôt alone in all this. Before in the past he might have been, but right now he had people who were willing to help him, and they were reliable people too.

"We‚Äôll meet tonight, at around 8 Pm, that‚Äôll give us two hours before the curfew to get in and get out, which should be plenty of time."

Thus, with all that, the plan was set in motion. After Quinn returned to his room, all he needed to do now was to wait until it was time to head to the front gate. With Vorden not in the room and no one to talk to, Quinn thought it would be a good chance to practice his Qi again. However, just as he was about to, the system had spoken out to him, which was a rather rare occurrence.

"You shouldn‚Äôt be doing this you know?" The system said.

But Quinn decided to not reply after their last confrontation.

"If they find out you‚Äôre the tenth leader, then..." The system stopped there, not going further.

"Then what?" Quinn replied. "Then they will find out Peter isn‚Äôt an illegal, that Fex did nothing wrong and then both of them will be set free."

"Stop acting like a child and just listen!" The system said. "I keep telling you, you‚Äôre too weak. Do you remember the girl from the rooftop? She was a vampire knight. There are many more who are just as powerful as her, and on top of that, you also have the vampire leaders, who are all at the Lord level, yet you, you‚Äôre still just a vampire, not even a noble. Do you really think you deserve a seat next to them?"

"Deserve a seat?" Quinn repeated. "I don‚Äôt care about any of this vampire business, I just want to protect those who are close to me. Tell me, is that so wrong?"

"That‚Äôs not what I was trying to say... This is not how I feel, but I know this is how they will feel. If they find out you‚Äôre a leader, then the others will target you. They will just see you as someone weak, someone who they can easily knock out, just so they can attain the throne."

Quinn remained silent for a moment. These days he wasn‚Äôt enjoying his conversation with the system and was wondering how different his life would have been if he had never found that book in the first place.

"You were one of the old leaders, weren‚Äôt you?" Quinn said. "I know you won‚Äôt confirm it, but it‚Äôs the only reason why you know so much."

"I can see you have made up your mind." The system said. "I tried stopping this but they will find out sooner or later, once you obtain one of the council seats as a leader, willingly or unwillingly. I will tell you everything you want to know then. That is, if you even live to get to that point.
