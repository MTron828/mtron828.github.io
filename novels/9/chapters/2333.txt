Big news had spread across the vampire crops units. After all, the story of one of thier won members, a captain no less killing two of those in its squad was certainly something to talk about. On top of that, they all became aware due to the alert that was put out.

What came as a big surprise to everyone, was that Jessica had volunteered herself in. At the Green city, thier was a giant pillar, a tower made of metal sticking out from the sea. Thier were many of these that built up the pathways, the land mass and the city that everyone lived on.

However, on one of the towers, thier was no connection to the others, it was slightly away from the others. Meaning one would have to use a mode of flying transport to get thier, this was the base of the vampire crop that was located at Green City.

Inside, Jessica was standing as a machine scanned her. A green light was emitting on her body moving up and down. A special device that was making sure they had the right person, that it wasn't some copy, or someone who had the ability to change into others.

While in this room though, she wasn't alone. Thier was a whole squad that was keeping an eye on her, five members in total, but thier were actually six in the room. Because the chief of the base, a vampire named Dzai was standing there as well.

Unlike the other vampires that were in thier corps uniform, he was stood thier with a large great sword on his back, coloured in black, and a black helmet that covered his entire face, but had two horns on the top shaped like a bull. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Jessica didn't even know what he looked like due to the mask covering him. The fact that he was a chief, of the base belonging to Green City, meant he was strong. Since Green city was practically the capital of Earth with Logan living thier.

Jessica was being moved to a holding cell, while they went through the formalities. She had a pair of strong hand cuffs on her. Half of them were made from beast crystal energy. If it touched her skin she would feel a burning sensation.

As she walked through the hallways, Dzai confidently went next to her, while others seemed a little hesitant to get close.

'This is chief Dzai, they say his strength is on par with Andy. If he were to become an enemy he would be a tough one to go against.'

These instances, where Jessica had these thoughts saddened her a lot, because before all of these people were her strong and great allies, and now all of them were potential enemies.

Eventually, just like with all criminals, Jessica was taken to a holding cell. The door was opened up, and she was told to head inside, but coming inside with her was Dzai, and the door had shut behind him.

She could feel his large presence on her back, and she was too worried to turn around.

'What is It…am I being attacked now, here alone, but there's no one to see me. Calm down…they said, that they wouldn't kill me, and I still have the tracking device on me. They didn't find anything right!'

Dzai didn't do anything apart from walking past her, and placing something on the wall. It was a round device that was stuck on the centre. It beeped a few times and then a screen displayed with a large old woman's face on it.

"Ba..Barbra!" Jessica called out. It was the chief of her own vampire corps base, essentially her direct boss.

"Jessica, I am happy that you finally gave yourself in." Barbra said.

Imemduilty, Jessica's head went to the floor. She wanted to say it wasn't her, but what would that help, would that do anything, they had a different plan now anyway.

"I called in a favour from my friend Dzai here. He owes me a few from a way back you see, otherwise you would never be able to see this message. I know you probably want to say a lot, but we should perhaps not talk…not here.

"I wanted to just let you know, that I believe that you're innocent. Even though everything else tells me otherwise, I want to believe in the young recruit that rose up to captain with those by her side, that she would never do such a thing, at least not without reason.

"In order for you to get a fair trial, I pushed and did my best. The investigation and the trial will continue, back here. Dzai and a squad will be transporting you. I want you to get a fair chance."

So Jessica was unable to say anything back, Dzai went forward and snatched the device off the wall before crushing it with a single hand allowing small pieces to fall the floor.

Jessica could be heard sobbing, trying to wipe away the tears on her shoulders since she was unable to use her hands.

"Thank you." She said, thankful that thier were still some people she could believe in.

——

After a couple of hours to herself, Jessica was being transported. She walked along the halls away from the eyes of others and went right onto a medium-sized spaceship. It was square-shaped, long, somewhat like a plane, with two large wings and energy thrusters hovering it in place.

The squad of five and Dzai were all there, as they got on board, and the ship was on its way. She was sat down, in between two of the other Vampire Corps members, without a single one of them saying a word.

Dzai just stood by the back door with the handle of his large sword propped up against the back.

'This is all okay...no matter what happens, the others will come find me.' Jessica thought.

Right on cue, a dreaded noise was heard. An alarm was going off inside the ship.

"An unidentified aircraft is following us, sir, and it's not responding to any of our signals," the pilot shouted.

"It looks like someone trying to break her out," one of the corps members said, standing up. As he did, a loud explosion went off, and the whole ship veered slightly to the right.

"We're being attacked. Our right wing was just hit. Emergency thrusters are being used on the bottom, but it's going to be hard to steer this thing."

A view appeared on board the ship, showing what was taking place, and they could see that not only was a ship following them, but standing right on top of it was a vampire with green long hair.

'That's him...that matches the exact description that Galanar gave back then...it has to be him!' Jessica thought, her whole body shaking.

For a second, Dzai glanced at Jessica, noticing her actions. It wasn't of someone who thought they were being saved, but of someone who was being chased.

"Open the door!" Dzai ordered.

The others didn't ask why but instead decided to open the back door. A large gust of wind could be felt on all of them as the door opened, and now they could directly see the one that was attacking them.

Magnus stood on top with a smile on his face and swung out his arm, releasing a blood swipe. It looked regular, but it was far faster than what a normal person could produce. It came out as fast as a blood bullet.

At the same time, Dzai grabbed the handle of his great sword and pulled it out, striking the blood swipe right in the centre and breaking it into particles in an instant.

"Whoo!" The other members of the Vampire Corps cheered.

"That's our chief!"

They were confident that they had the chief on board and weren't too worried if anyone came after them.

"I see," Magnus said. "It seems that she does have someone close to her that is relatively strong. No wonder the others weren't able to succeed, but none of you have any idea who you are facing!"

Magnus swung his arms, and several blood swipes came out toward the ship. Seeing it all, Dzai swung his blade several times, breaking every single one of the blood swipes. This was getting Magnus quite infuriated, and so the ship started to move.

It sped up and was now beneath the transport ship.

"Block this!" Magnus threw both of his hands together, delivering a blood cannon. It ripped through the bottom of the ship, destroying all of the energy thrusters, and now the ship was falling, heading for a crash landing.

"That won't be enough to kill them, but they have nowhere to run now."
