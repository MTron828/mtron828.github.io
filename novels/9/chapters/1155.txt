Chapter 1156 A special gif

Outside of the main base, Quinn was waiting with Sil, Shiro, and Layla. Using a bit of his own Qi abilities, Quinn was able to settle the wild Qi that was affecting her body, allowing Layla’s natural Qi to fuse with her injured cells allowing her to start healing.

With the foreign Qi expelled, she was soon enough good as new. At least physically speaking, mentally was a different story. Honestly, Quinn didn’t really want to take Layla in her current state. He was deeply concerned, since it was clear there was something that she hadn’t told them, and he knew well that she had a history with Pure who were also out on the hunt for the Demi-god tier beast.

The reason why he allowed her to come along, was because he was worried that she would just go off on her own once more, if she was left behind. There was no guarantee there would be Logan or someone else rescuing her next. It was far better off being next to him than away.

While waiting, Quinn observed everything that was happening. Mechs were being escorted out of the large tube tunnels and then being taken to a factory. They were coming out partially destroyed. It looked brutal as more and more were being dragged out.

Quinn noticed another strange little thing. The captured beasts were actually being sent down a different tube, meaning they were heading to a different pit in the landscape underground, not where the damaged Mechs were coming from.

’Are they trying to trick the humanoid beast somehow? If the same thing happens to the Demi-god tier beast as the basic one, then it means after it harvests the crystal it should enter a weakened state. Do they intend to attack it while in the middle of its partial evolution?’

’Are they trying to use this information to their advantage? If they send it down the same tube then maybe it will be too obvious. While sending it to one next to it, perhaps after the beast is done destroying the mechs, it will move to hunt for beasts again.’

Of course Quinn was just guessing, but other than that he didn’t really understand what they were trying to do. Perhaps Logan would have been able to shed some light once he had obtained more information.

’Still if we can, it would be nice to capture this beast in one go, and hopefully we can use its body straight away. There will be the matter to discuss with the Earthborn group, but if by then a new Supreme commander has been selected, we can maybe use Sach to order them to stand down.’

Finally it looked like Longblade was done with his meeting, as he came out with a strong team of five men, each one armed to the max in high tier beast gear. Nathan, was an additional sixth person who had come with them, who had listened in on the meeting as their representative.

"I’ll explain what has been discussed on the way to the Demi-god tier beast. These five including Nathan are really the only ones capable and strong enough to go against such a beast. The soldiers are evacuating the underground area at the moment, so we might have to use a special travelling tube to go in and out of areas." Longblade explained.

He then looked at who was coming from the Cursed faction, and noticed that the Green boy and one of the V had been left behind.

’I assume it’s because Green isn’t really much of a fighter. ’Bucky’ and the V girl are here. Could it be that not all of them are as strong as him? Or did they just leave the other one behind as a guard?’ Longblade wondered, but after having experienced the strength of Leo’s student he was glad that he came along.

"Here take this." The Colonel said as he held out what looked like a type of katana blade of some kind. "I know in the VR game you used a sword, but you should follow in your teacher’s footsteps. That sword there is a Legendary tier sword. It’s the old weapon I used to have, but I found one with an active skill that’s more suited to my needs."

"Think of it as your reward for winning that fight earlier." Longblade said.

For a second Quinn didn’t even know what to do, should he just accept the weapon or was this some kind of trap. Quinn had grown too used to people from the Earthborn group trying to get revenge, attack them or even more, but Longblade wasn’t doing any of that.

Using the Inspect skill, Quinn was worried that maybe there was some type of curse put on the weapon, but he was just even more amazed at what he could see. He had also forgotten for a moment, that the one receiving the gift wasn’t him, but ’Bucky’.

Although the weapon had no active skill it had one very special trait. The weapon was indestructible. It was unable to break.

’Can this be real, can a weapon really have this as a skill? Just what type of beast had to be killed to create something like this?’

The stats that came with it, weren’t even close to his gauntlets. At the same time he was no master swordsman, but maybe one day it would come in handy to train in the sword, and this would certainly be useful in these types of situations.

"I thank you, for your generous gift." Quinn bowed down and took the katana-like sword that was shining a bright silver in colour, and placed it on his side. He wanted to put it in his dimensional space but was afraid it would give away who he was.

’It seems like hiding who I really am was the right move, and it proves that not everyone in the Cursed faction is a group of bad people.’

Before leaving, Sil had touched Colonel Longblade, taking a part of his power. He looked at the kid, and by now most people were aware of who he was based on the description, so the Colonel didn’t say anything and allowed for it to happen.

Finally the group was off.

Meanwhile, Logan was attempting to complete his own mission that had been assigned to him. Standing outside the lab, he could see that they were in a rush to get the beast transported down to one of the special tubes.

Using this brief moment of opportunity, Logan was able to take advantage of the situation. His spiders were able to locate and enter the inside of the facility. Watching their every move, while sending information back to Logan.

’I haven’t done this stuff in a while.’ Logan thought as he walked rushing into the facility just acting as every other soldier did. It was easy to enter the base and he understood once inside why they were a bit lax on the outside. Every door seemed to be made out of glathrium, and had a passcode machine to its side.

Although there were those like Quinn who could bypass those, not many people could. As for Logan, the machine that could keep him out would have to be created first.

’Are all the doors reinforced because of what’s inside?’ Logan wondered, remembering what Quinn had told him about his nightly escapade. He walked around looking for the specific door that Quinn had entered from last time.

During his time here, he didn’t want to leave any stone unturned, but he thought if his time was limited it would be best to get to the most important thing first. Eventually, he reached the area where the said beast was meant to be. Using his spiders they were able to squeeze through the small gap in the bottom.

He checked for any signs of anyone else inside, scientist or anyone else, but apparently there were only a few beasts. Placing his hand on the access code, it took a few seconds before he was allowed in. Logan left a few of his spiders in the hallway, acting as sentries to warn him if anyone wanted to enter.

Once inside, Logan quickly found the Basic tier beast that was being experimented on, telling him that he was indeed in the right room.

"Let’s see just what sort of things you’ve been doing here." Logan mumbled as he placed his hands on the terminal, and the information flooded into his brain. A couple of minutes later and all the information he found useful was inputted into him.

"It seems like there are more labs like this one with different beasts, and they only store the information of each beast in a certain lab. It doesn’t seem like they have been monitoring this one for long. But there is one thing that interests me, in one of the files.’

When looking through all the information, Logan had obtained a map to all the labs where they were running similar experiments on the beasts. But the one that had caught the most attention was one that was labeled Humanoid - Legendary tier beast.

’Are they trying to make another Demi-god tier beast? Or do they plan to go even beyond that?" VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
