Chapter 930 - Glowing shadows

The shadow disk that was coming towards Cindy was quite large in size and had a width of around a meter. Depending on how strong the attack was, if it hit her, then her body would be sliced entirely in half.

’Wearing the armour, even if that hits me, it shouldn’t be too strong. I still don’t know how to use this thing properly, but it ins;t an armour that has been passed down for no reason!’ Cindy thought.

However, sweat ran down her face, showing that things weren’t exactly going her way. Ever since Quinn had activated his soul weapon, he was doing things she had never seen before. She didn’t know much about the Punishers like Bryce, but did study up on them after Arthur had returned last time. Expecting that she might run into some trouble.

The main thing that was worrying her was the purple glow Quinn’s shadows were emitting.

Not wanting it to touch her, she lifted her hand, and a rush of blood came from underneath the ground. It looked like a small waterfall only in reverse. One of his disks was eaten up by the cascade of blood. It looked like with such a large attack, the little shadow that was around it wouldn’t do much, but before his other one would have the same fate. Controlling the shadow, he managed to split the large blade into six individual smaller pieces.

The small blades moved faster, and Quinn was able to control each of them precisely as if they were an extension of his own body. Going around the waterfall, Cindy had blocked her own field of vision. The little blades had hit. Moving her body, they had touched nothing but the blood armour, and soon disappeared with the shadow disappearing in the air as well.

’Looks like I have nothing to worry about.’ Seeing how the purple glow of the shadow did nothing when touching her armour.

’She’s learning to use the blood abilities more now, Quinn. If you look closely, she is gathering more blood. Quickly you have to finish her off!’ Vincent warned as he was observing the situation.

’What do you think I have been trying to do, woo her!?’ Quinn shouted back.

’Then we’re just going to have to get close!’ Quinn shouted, running forward.

She was ready for a close confrontation with her two wh.i.p.s, and it was why Quinn hadn’t moved in up till this point. On top of this, he had time to learn a little bit about his shadow staying away. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The whip was far faster than any movement he could produce. So even with unlimited MC cells to use with the shadow, he wouldn’t be able to move the shadow in time.

However, watching Cindy strike the shadow portals before, he had memorised her distance, and she knew hers as well as she gripped onto the end. When Quinn got close enough, he opened up a larger shadow circle in front of him and ran right through it.

’Wait! He can go through the shadow himself as well!’

Before she knew it, Quinn was behind her, with two large shadow disks by his side. He swung his arm out at full strength, trying to cleave her head off, but she had ducked the first attack. The second one, she wasn’t so fortunate, as the disk struck her in her arm.

The closer the shadow was to Quinn, the faster and better he could control it. It seemed to react to the strength he had in his swing. The second disk hit her, and a scraping sound against the blood c.h.e.s.t piece could be heard, and he could feel the weight of the attack. Even though he wasn’t making any physical connection, the force felt like that between two magnets.

She was soon sent across the floor, and as she landed, she kicked off the ground to create distance between the two of them. Looking up though, the area looked different as she noticed she was in a room full of shadows blocking out the sky and rain above. Soon, something was felt grabbing her feet from below and pulling her.

She looked down at her legs, but there was nothing there until she could see Quinn dropping from the strange ceiling above. Quinn had activated the shadow dome surrounding her so she couldn’t escape. He needed to keep her in place, then using shadow hop, he came from above.

’Blood attacks like blood bullets, and the blood swipe won’t work because of that armour, so I need to get it off her, or...’ Quinn said as he came full force with a hammer strike.

Lifting up her forearms, she made it so the blood armour would take most of the effects, and for a second, the two remained still with Quinn in mid-air. The power of the hammer strike was felt as it sent shockwaves through the dome, and even the shadows were shaking.

"Arghh!" Cindy screamed, as for the second time, her arms had been crushed, as the hammer strike had done its work. Hurting her internally, with blood soaking through the armour. A few seconds after though, and the armour started to light up.

Still unsure what the strange armour would do if it hit him with its power, Quinn did the only thing he could do....

From the outside, they could only see a shadow dome. However, red lights could be seen piercing through the shadow. It looked like light rays were coming out until the whole shadow dome had disappeared. Standing still on the square was Cindy, but Quinn was now nowhere to be seen.

"The tenth leader!" Muka shouted, quite shocked at the outcome based on how well Quinn had been doing. Not seeing him there, he could only think that Quinn had died.

"No, that boy is still alive," Bryce said, knowing what Quinn had done, because he had done the same thing against him.

A portal of shadow opened. From Quinn’s shadow lock skill, he had locked himself in the shadow space in order to avoid the attack. However, while Cindy was concentrating on the shadow he had come out of, she didn’t see another portal opening behind her, and two large Shadow disks were ready.

Cindy was mid-swing of her wh.i.p.s, and as her wrist flicked, at the same time, the two large disks had hit her on the back, chucking her body forward towards Quinn.

Using all his strength, stepping on the ground and concentrating all his anger towards her, he swung his fist over his head. It was an overhand throw that allowed one to use all the momentum they could, and he had planted his heavy-handed fist right in her face.

The only problem was, the blood wh.i.p.s had managed to hit his sides as well.

"You’re dead!" Cindy managed to make a crooked smile through all her broken bones. Quinn was quite surprised she was still alive. This was due to her attempting to heal her wounds with her ability while Quinn had delivered her punch.

Still, his punch was far stronger than she had anticipated, and she was unable to heal the wounds as much in time, and something else had happened as well. The shadows that covered Quinn’s hand, a few of them, seemed to be attached onto her face.

As for Quinn, the wh.i.p.s had hit his body of shadows, he braced himself for pain, the loud bang was heard at the tail end, and he felt the force in his body from both sides, but there was no pain at all.

’What’s going on?’ Quinn thought. As he looked down, and could see he was perfectly fine.

He looked at his sides, and the shadows seemed to move away from where the attack had hit, he could now see his clothing underneath. New shadows were now moving to the gap, and soon he was once again completely covered in shadows.

’Is this the power of the shadow body? Does it block my whole body from attacks as well?’ Quinn thought.

As for Cindy, she had managed to get up but was suddenly in a panic as she touched her face.

"Whvt heie yve dene!" Cindy tried to speak, but her jaw, her nose and eye socket were broken entirely. Leaving her with a mangled face. The remnants of the shadow from his fist could be seen on her face as well.

’Now that I know my body is safe from her attacks, I can do this!’ Quinn thought.

[Your time is up]

[Your soul weapon will now be deactivated]
