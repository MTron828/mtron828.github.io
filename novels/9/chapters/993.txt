Chapter 994 - Thumbs up

The students who weren’t participating in the fight went back to their teacher, watching the match behind the glass screen. Quinn would have been with the others, but he had an obligation to look after the students and watch it with them.

Still, it didn’t stop Fex from breaking away from Helen and Peter, who were a bore in his eyes and coming over to where Quinn was.

"Hey, Qu- I mean Hardy, I guess you must be a little nervous, seeing your little runts out there fighting," Fex said.

The students around could hear every word Fex said and looked up at the loud teacher. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

"Who’s that? Is he someone important?"

"Not really. I think he just teaches that sewing class or something."

"We can ignore him then. Well, I’m just glad I’m not a teacher like him." The students spoke, not caring if Fex heard them or not.

"Hey, hey, my sewing class is great!" Fex said, but seeing all the students looking through the glass screen ignoring him, he knew it was pointless to say anymore.

"I’m nervous, but not for me, for them.’’ Quinn said. "I can imagine for them they think that this moment means everything for their future lives, but honestly it doesn’t. I want them to just have fun if possible."

The first number was called out, number one. All students with number one would soon be entering the fighting field. Looking at his wristwatch, Venus noticed that he would be the one going first.

"I think you almost forgot this," Quinn said, handing over a grey spear with a sharp blue tip at the end. It was Venus’s beast weapon, which was an interesting choice considering his ability. He was so nervous that he had almost forgotten his weapon.

Finally, the number had reached zero, and the doors opened. Venus immediately started to rush out into the open, and the two from the other areas, who were marked number one, had also entered the arena.

"Stay calm!" Quinn shouted, but he was afraid that even if Venus could hear him, he had already blocked out everything and was focused on the fight.

Venus was just imitating what the other students were doing. He saw the two of them rush forward, and so did he. The audience’s cheers were carrying the students to do crazy things and not act straight. It wasn’t until he reached the centre that he realised who exactly was going up against.

Although he didn’t recognise the male student from the Graylash house who wielded a spear as well, Venus did know the student from the Earthborn house. For the two of them used to go to the same school as each other.

It was Erlen, when Venus looked him in the eye and could see the sword being held in his hands, his body started to shake. The three of them were running towards the centre at this point, but suddenly. Erlen took a turn and went towards the student in the Graylash house instead.

’Why is he going for me? Shouldn’t we take out the weak one first so the two of us can have a proper match? Isn’t that what Zhen told us?’ The Graylash member thought.

Taken by surprise, he thrust his spear half-heartedly, and the attack was parried by Erlen’s sword. With his other hand free, he grabbed onto the spear, and it started to freeze in place, making it heavier. Charging in more, Erlen started to hit the student with full force using the side of his sword. It had hit his ribs. Then when he was up close, a punch to the cut.

Before he could recover, Erlen had grabbed the student and started to freeze his body all over, attaching him to the ground. While the Graylash students body was frozen, Erlen went to hit the large block of ice with his sword again, but before he could, the ref on standby for the Graylash family stopped Erlen by the arm.

"The Graylash student has lost this match." The ref said. They broke the ice safely and brought the student back to where they were.

It was a completely one sided fight that was over in just a few seconds. People knew Erlen was strong with his ability, but it seemed like he wasn’t too bad with the sword either. It was no wonder they had decided to use him for the event.

With the Graylash student out of the match, only one person left, Venus.

’Crap! Is he going to try to pay me back in this arena for what happened to his family, but the ref will stop the fight if that happens, right? They’ll stop it before I get seriously hurt, just like what happened now.’ Venus thought.

However, the question in his head was: What if they didn’t stop the fight in time?

"This is bad!" Swin said, being concerned for his friend. "Venus’s ability is water, while Erelen’s is ice. It’s going to be a hard battle for him to win unless he uses his weapon."

The others hearing this agreed with Swin as well, and from the look of it, Venus was still suffering from past trauma dealt by Erlen.

However, his next move surprised everyone as he placed the sword away.

"I beat the Graylash family member for you, I hope this is enough for you to forgive me, and I will forfeit from this match," Erlen said, raising his hand. "In return, all I ask for you is that you at least let my parents work at the company again."

Erlen was bowing down to Venus, something never seen before, and the students watching in the seats had no clue what was going on. Still, Quinn could hear everything, even through the glass with his super hearing.

"They don’t have to be in the same position they were in before. It’s just they built that company up from scratch, and I can see it’s killing them every day to not be a part of it, and it was all my fault. Please, I’m sorry! I don’t know why General Hardy looked out for you or what your relationship is with him, but please ask him this favour!" Erlen went on his knees, and he placed his head on the floor, begging him.

Honestly, Venus didn’t know what to do. He wasn’t practically close with teacher Hardy and didn’t have a clue why he had gone so far for them. If Venus wanted to, he couldn’t really do anything, and he didn’t want to agree and then not follow through with his request.

Hearing everything, Quinn thought about it. Erlen clearly was affected by his ways, and he wasn’t like some who could never admit their wrong doings. People could change, and in this instance, what Quinn was most impressed by, was the fact that Erlen didn’t seem to be doing this for his own benefit, he could tell.

Erlen was asking for his parents more than anything.

Lifting his head off the floor, Erlen knew that maybe Venus couldn’t do anything, but he couldn’t ask Hardy. Sometimes asking those you did wrong or the cause of this would make it worse.

Just as he was about to walk away back to his group, he could see a thumbs up from Hardy himself in the distance through the window.

’Wait, is that thumbs up for me?’ Erlen thought. Venus was still looking away from him, so it couldn’t be towards Erlen. He then pointed at himself to make sure, and he could see teacher Hardy giving him a nod.

’How...how could he hear me through the glass and from so far away!’ He thought, but it didn’t matter. The emotions started to build up in Erlen, about how stupid he had been. In his whole life, he had gotten away with everything he had done. He had never suffered from the consequences until that day he had learnt a lot.

"Thank you!" Erlen shouted, bowing down and heading back to his classmates.

"Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like we have a winner!" Oscar announced to everyone’s surprise. The boy who looked nervous and did nothing had won, giving the first win to the Cursed house.

’I don’t know who you are, Hardy, but thank you.’ Erlen thought.
