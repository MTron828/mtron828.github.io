Chapter 1844: Pure Army!

As the spaceship hovered down to land on top of the Grand Rein, nervousness gripped some of the people on the ship. After all, they were on the opposing side, voicing against the beliefs of Pure.

Never in their entire lives did they believe that they might end up going to the heart of the Pure base. At the same time, they had no clue what they were expecting either.

When landing and getting off the ship, they found about fifteen people in light brown clothing waiting for them. Other than them, a couple wore a white overcoat and had a unique number embedded on the back of the coat.

"Even after all this time, they're still doing that type of stuff?" Peter frowned.

They were coming in on the very top deck, and that's when they noticed something strange. Several deep scrapes, burnt spots, and more were all over the large platform.

"It looks like someone attacked the Rein ship recently," Lucia commented.

"I wonder who it was. Does Pure have enemies other than the Greens?"

"I wouldn't be too surprised," Mitchell replied.

"There have been cases of people who defected from the Vampire Corps to go after other vampires and even Pure."

Although Muka didn't say anything, she found the markings and scratches to be quite strange. The way the strikes and the attacks were and how distanced the marks were. It didn't seem like an attack from a ship or spaceship of some sort.

As the ship landed, each of them walked down the ramp and standing in front of them were two men in White overcoats, one with the number 13 and the other with the number 15.

By their side, there was the normal fighting force of the Pure base, in a type of brown clothing with pieces of Blue armour on certain parts of their body.

"Welcome those of you from Green city!" The man with the number 13 announced. He had quite long hair, which were dyed in a shade of dark green and eyes that were a bit wide like a snake.

"Yes, send the most untrustworthy-looking person to greet us," Jessica whispered under her breath.

"Today, me, number 13 and 15, will be showing you around our Country, Rein. We will then have a nice meal together, and after that, your trip will conclude with a meeting with our leaders. Our leaders are getting ready for the meeting." 13 said with a smile while rubbing his hands together.

Getting ready didn't sound good to them. They were more afraid that they were setting up a trap. What would one need to get ready for if they were just going to have a talk? Regardless, if they were taking them around the ship, which was known as Pure's country, then there would be plenty of witnesses if they were to do anything.

"We accept your offer," Muka said, wearing a balaclava that covered up half of her mouth, only showing the top of her face and her eyes.

However, even then, nearly all the men that set eyes on her for a second started to blush and look away.

"I hope the meal that you have planned is suited for all of our tastes. It would be a bit of a problem if I were to go hungry." Muka said with her eyes slightly glowing red.

She made it clear to them all that she was a vampire, but it didn't have the effect she quite wanted.

"Please just bite me instead! You can have all my blood!" A man shouted, and his subordinate slapped him on the back of the head. Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

It was awkward between everyone for a moment after that, but to break the ice, agent 13 started to move, asking the rest to follow. There were four guards in the group at all times, but they gave them their space.

It was obvious the guards weren't there to keep them in line, these people could do nothing against Peter, and Peter had become somewhat of a known figure after the video had gone viral, revealing his strength.

On the ship itself, there were giant elevators that would go through the various floors. On top of that, it didn't just go up and down but went backwards, forwards, left and right as well.

They had preset routes to take one to all the different places around the ship. There was even a metro train system on the ship as well that could be used to take you to different spots.

The first place they were escorted to looked like an entire village. There were houses, long green fields and shops and supermarkets on the ship itself. Then when continuing their tour, they were taken to what looked like a shopping street on board the ship.

From leisure facilities to everything else, it was as if Pure had spent all their budget on this giant ship in the middle of the sea. Of course, Green City was just as impressive, but it was just interesting to see the other factions do something different with the resources.

Lucia and Jessica could imagine living in either Green city or on the Rein. The only thing was, for those like them, it was impossible. It made them feel upset in a way. If Pure chose to accept vampires, then perhaps there would just be great places on the Earth that people could visit.

After showing them all the impressive locations of the ship, they were starting to head closer to the upper floors, and what they had come across when stepping out of the elevator this time was a training field.

It looked like a giant wasteland with facilities scattered around the place: break rooms, equipment and different training areas. On one side, there was a group of people sitting down crossed-legged. The instructor was standing, explaining how they should feel their Qi in the centre of their body.

In another area, there were those who fought and jumped, sometimes with their bare hands, sometimes with weapons, striking chi here and there, and finally, which was the strangest thing for Peter, there were simulators with machine guns.

They were firing bullets out at targets while moving in formations. They looked like normal bullets, but those that had dealt with Qi before and had seen them knew they weren't. They were bullets filled with Qi. Either the bullets themselves were different, or it was the gun they were holding onto.

"Pure, they have more soldiers than I thought, and this is just the main ship, not including all of the small cities." Mitchell thought.

These weapons are impressive and have been a problem for us for a while because they make even the weakest person into a deadly machine that can kill.

In a way, if Pure asked all of its civilians to raise their firearms, they would have a fighting chance. It's important that we aren't seen as the aggressor; otherwise, the people will hold up these weapons and go against us.

They stayed and watched the army train for a while. It looked like 13 was trying to do something by showing them such a place.

"What do you think? Our forces are quite strong, right?" 13 asked.

"Ha." Peter laughed out loud, saying that. "None of the people here could even beat this little girl if they were to try."

As for who he was referring to as the little girl, it was Minny. And upon hearing this, she smiled and raised her hand to make a little bicep to show her muscle. Although they were non-existent.

Those training nearby had stopped to take a look, and it was the same for 13 as well.

"Your army is very strong." Mitchell interrupted.

"The two of them are just kids who are proud of their own strength. Just ignore what they say."

Peter took offence to that, but before he could say anything, Lucia grabbed his arm and shook her head. For some reason, Peter seemed to stop right there.

"Alright, that's enough showing you all around, it's time for you to have your meal, and I have been informed that the meeting will commence there as well."
