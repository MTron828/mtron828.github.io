Chapter 2483 Immortui's power

After witnessing Quinn being snatched right in front of his eyes, Immortui was filled with rage. He screamed into the air, and his colourless ability activated far and wide, spreading out and draining the colour from everything.

It continued to stretch out further and further through the universe, spreading far and wide. Where it was going, what it was aiming for, not even Immortui knew. With the way his power worked, if the colourless ability had managed to touch those that had interfered, it would stop them in their tracks.

However, Immortui wasn't receiving any signs of anything, and as his anger started to subside, so did his power. It reverted back into him, and he was left standing there for a moment, with his two snake-like dragon spirits hovering around the back of his shoulders.

He placed his hand on his face, and his shoulders started to shake up and down, until he swung his head back and broke out into a fit of laughter.

"HAHA! I can't believe it, right when I thought I had it all, something comes and sweeps me off once again! I see universe, you are testing me, right?"

"If I can't get through this, then I don't deserve to have the chance to go out on top!"

Right there and then, Immortui decided to sit on the ground. He did so with his knee lifted and his arm relaxing on top of it. This was his thinking position.

'For them to be able to come in so fast and leave quickly, it has to be a teleportation power of some kind,' Immortui thought. 'If it was them, they would have sent Mundus, and he would have dealt with the situation differently. Does that mean they are friends of Quinn? Ah yes, I saw him, didn't I, that damned Boneclaw. Did the Familiars end up betraying me?'

Immortui couldn't help but laugh to himself again.

'It's no worry; they were only a small part of my plan. But I wonder what they saw that managed to give them so much hope that they would switch sides.'

Not worrying about that for now, Immortui needed to find Quinn. Due to the state he was in, he didn't think he would have the chance to escape anytime soon. This allowed him to have a calmer mind when thinking about what to do.

And in a lot of ways, this was worse for his enemies. If Immortui wasn't calm, he would have gone chasing straight after Quinn, just trying to find him wherever he could, hopping from place to place.

Instead, he chose a different method. As Immortui took in deep breaths, the red mist was entering his nose, and he breathed out a few times again. Eventually, after some passing of time, the red mist in the whole area had stopped.

It no longer looked like mist, but around him, it looked just like glitter that was in the air. Just like the demons, Immortui was able to have control of the power in the air, but his control was on a far higher level.

'That took longer than I thought, but I can now connect with all of the red energy that's in this space' Immortui then closed his eyes as he started to focus.

'The red energy, the energy that seeps into this universe from the land of the dead. With my powers, I am quite closely connected to that place as well, which is why I can sense this energy better than most. T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

'For every being that comes or is born into this world, they breathe in this energy into their bodies. It is inside them and has become a part of them, whether they realize it or not. It is what causes them to go mad, fighting each other for petty reasons, because the red energy only wants one thing, to bring people closer to death.

'The inhabitants of this world have been affected by it. Little do they know that this red mist is actually my power to begin with.'

For all the local inhabitants that were alive, they had always known about the red mist that lingered in the air. They thought it had always been there, and to them, the threat of Immortui and his demons was something that had come along later.

The truth was, in his first war against the celestials, he had been greatly injured before being banished to this space. So he stayed put, doing next to nothing, apart from releasing his power all over the universe.

As his power infected the natural inhabitants, it caused them to get irritated and fight for next to no reasons, believing it was due to them wishing to be the strongest, more deaths were occurring, boosting Immortui's powers.

After thousands of years, with his powers somewhat regained, Immortui had come to strike back and fought against the Champions.

This was why the local inhabitants believed the red mist always existed, and Immortui's incident was something that had happened later.

As time went on, Immortui's power had spread out everywhere, far too thick that even he didn't feel like he had control of it. Which was why he had to close his eyes and focus, trying to feel out every part of his energy.

'Those that have been here will have a large amount of red energy in their body; those that are new will have a small amount. All I will do is find all of those with next to no red energy in their body and take them out one by one.'

Closing his eyes again, he started to focus. The universe was large; his power was large, so it would take some time. He had finally found what he was looking for.

Standing up on his two feet, Immortui started to gather the energy around his body. The red energy condensed around him, turning into a red glow, just like with the other demons.

'If I use my powers around me and around this space, I can move faster in the direction I want to go in.'

Jumping off, it appeared as if Immortui almost vanished. Using his powers as a form of travel was a great way to get from A to B, but it wasn't something he could do in a fight since it took a lot of focus.

Following it through, a few minutes later, on a barren planet that looked like a moon, as the ground was covered in grey, Immortui had found a person that didn't belong.

"I found you!" Immortui said, immediately activating his colourless power. He didn't want the person to escape. As the colourless power hit the person, they slowly started to fade, until they had turned into nothing.

'If it disappeared like that... it means it's not the real one. It has to be one of their powers. No matter, I will eventually find the one I'm looking for,' Immortui thought, condensing the red energy around him again, and jumping, heading to the next destination.

Immortui was coming after them, and if he needed to do it one at a time, then so be it.
