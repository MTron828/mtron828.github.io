Chapter 1027 - Help from an enemy

A special event had been announced the next day. Inviting all the important figures around the world. Giant corporations, manufacturing companies and more. On top of that all the teachers at the school, and high level military personnel had also been invited. Those from the Graylash family weren’t left out, including the family head Owen Graylash and finally those from the Cursed faction.

Quinn was ready to head back with the others but when he had received the invitation to the event and told how soon it would be, he decided that he would stay at least till the event was over. Considering how many important people would be there.

An invitation was extended out to those Cursed that had also arrived before the others who were on planet Caladi. The invitation that stuck out the most though, was one that was given to Quinn claiming that they wished for Richard Eno to come along as well.

Before leaving the planet these invites were all given to them in person by Oscar, and now they had arrived back at the large new school and had been given top of the line rooms filled with everything they could ever need to stay in for the time being.

As for Richard, he said he would be coming, but he would be there when he was needed, and seemingly disappeared without saying anything else, he didn’t go through a teleporter with them, and just disappeared into the desert, so he was not at the school with them.

Everyone would freshen up, and take a few minutes rest, before Sam requested for all of them to meet up in the same room. Sam wanted to know more about what happened between Quinn and Richard, as well as the fight between the Dalki. It was time they knew more about the bigger picture and all this vampire stuff so they had a better understanding. Through that, they could help out Quinn more.

At the same time, Sam wanted to inform Quinn of everything they had found out from Brock, to do with the Balde island and the role of the Blade family.

Lying in his bed staring at the ceiling Quinn was wondering what was going on.

’Richard Eno, why would you reveal yourself to the world like that, in front of Oscar. Everyone’s been looking for you. Are you just trying to cause more trouble for me, or is this one of your tests again.’

Thinking back to Enos’ personality, when Quinn had asked for the request to help Sil, he had come back saying that he wanted to stay with the Cursed faction for a while. It had come as a complete surprise to him.

Eno could even tell Quinn was struggling with the request that he had spoken about it.

"Are you worried that I will learn about all of the Cursed faction secrets? It would be the perfect way to destroy a faction from the inside out if you were a thorn in my side, but trust me that is not my goal. If you do think I’m an enemy, have you ever heard of keeping your friends close but your enemies closer?

"Besides there are a lot of people that want you dead Quinn. If they knew everything about you, and how much of a threat you could possibly be they would be hunting you down quite quickly. I don’t think anyone ever expected you to get as strong as you have done."

In the end, Quinn had decided to accept Eno’s request. He had a feeling the whole time Eno was telling the truth. Even if he was still acting in his strange ways.

’But I remember you did the same thing back then as well, and you even gave the same reason.’ Quinn said.

’That was because I thought it would help with your progress, and I was just trying to get you to avoid certain dangers that were out of your power for the time being.’ Vincent argued.

’Do you think that’s exactly what Eno is doing then? He states the same thing. Perhaps he thinks at the moment I, or the Cursed faction isn’t strong enough. If he told us all the information, or the Humans, they would try acting on it when they couldn’t.’

Still it was impossible to figure out without knowing everything. While waiting for the others, and thinking about getting stronger, Quinn did decide to check out one thing, all of the rewards he had received due to completing the quest.

To be honest, Quinn thought the rewards were a bit lackl.u.s.tre, especially considering what he had done or been through. He could only assume this was because it wasn’t a quest given by the system and instead was one given by Eno when his system was overridden which was a scary thought in itself.

[Level 62]

Quinn had levelled up a total of 9 times to reach level 62. It was quite the amount of exp he had gained for defeating the Dalki. He didn’t get any instant level ups, so all the level ups he did achieve were from pure exp, but now since he didn’t level up every ten levels the exp requirement was just getting bigger and bigger.

At this point, Quinn thought there were only three ways he could now level up. From defeating Demi-god, demon tier beasts or the Dalki. Through defeating beasts and the Dalki he could gain a level up through exp points, or if they awarded him an instant level up. The other way, would be receiving an instant level up quest from the system itself.

’I wonder what level I need to be to complete that Quest.’ Quinn thought.

He was thinking about the quest to find something beyond the level of a vampire lord. Would he reach it at level 70, 80 or maybe even a hundred he didn’t know. What he did know was with each level up he could feel his body changing into something.

With the stat points awarded Quinn did his usual. He tried to keep his points as balanced as possible, raising them all up to the nearest ten bracket for the best effect. His current stats were like so.

[Agility: 70]

[Stamina: 69]

[Charm 60]

On Vincent’s advice Quinn had stopped increasing the charm stat, since he was told at this level there would just be people he could control and people he couldn’t, no matter how high his charm stat was.

The following stat was the interesting one, and it had risen to be his highest.

[Blood control: 164]

Steadily Quinn’s blood control would grow as he used his blood abilities more often and it was the same during the Dalki fight. After fighting Cindy and Bryce it had increased a lot and using it inside his body all the time he did the same.

’I wonder how high someone’s stat would be if they had the absolute blood book?’ Quinn wondered.

’Now that your blood control is high enough, it would be nice if you learn some new blood abilities, apart from the basic ones you have been using this whole time.’ Vincent said. ’You’ve trained in fighting and it has reached a good level. If you’re going to be fighting using your full strength a lot more, you will no longer be able to hide the fact that you have blood powers, so I think this should be your next step into growing.’

’I remember you saying this before.’ Quinn replied scratching his head, a habit when he was struggling. ’But you also stated you couldn’t really teach me anything and that I should find a teacher. I think I’m already past the point where Fex could teach me things, which means the only people that could teach me better skills are vampire knights or a leader and I don’t think any of the leaders are willing to teach me.’ Quinn replied.

What Quinn also noticed when checking his system was while not in the vampire world, he didn’t gain any reputation points from his family. So they wouldn’t continue to build up while he was away and he couldn’t just come back and start making all sorts of improvements using the points.

It was one of the reasons; why Quinn was a little upset with the rewards, he was expecting to get a new title like ’Dalki killer’ or something that would help him in the future.

’There will be one person next to you that seems willing to help you. I’m sure they could teach you some new blood skills.’ Vincent suggested.

’Are you crazy, you can’t be suggesting what I think you’re suggesting? You want me to ask Richard Eno to teach me?’
