Clone Quinn charged forward, with his hands pulsating with the red aura, mixed with his shadow. With a strong blow. One attack would have the power as two as a delayed punch would come out after.

It was a move that no one expected and one that was unique to Quinn. Combined with the aura fists it was one of the best attacks he had, but the clone was unable to use the blood bullet attacks. 

Kronker, despite feeling all of the power in the air, confidently swung his bladed arm. The red mist that was swirling around started to spiral out. 

'Dead in one hit, I thought this fight would be more challenging than this.' Kronker thought.

Being the demon king, he had more control over the red crystals in his body, allowing him to transform the ends. Due to this, he could make his red crystals sharper than any other, at the same time, he was more powerful, faster and sturdier than any other. This attack would be one that would even damage the other demon kings.

Before the bladed strike reached Quinn, a black shadow appeared in front of him, his body went right through, and the strike slashed through the shadow. It split it in half, breaking it apart, but that's when Kronker couldn't see anything. 

'He disappeared?' Kronker thought. 

Coming through a shadow portal from behind, Quinn kicked the air, bursting forward, leaving a ripple in the air. He thrust both of his hands forward in a claw-like shape, and struck the back of the demon king's head. 

The force was extremely powerful, sending Kronker's head moving in the air, but it wasn't a great distance at all, it moved about an inch.

The champion shook his head seeing this. 

'A powerful attack, and a smart use of his unique powers, but that still isn't strong enough to go toe to toe with the strongest in this world.'

Kronker, having suffered no damage, was swinging his other arm aiming at Quinn behind his head once again, but midswing, the effect of the shadow blood activated, another blast had hit the side of his head, disrupting his swing. 

Quinn blasted the air with his blood aura, moving out of the way, and with his legs, kicked off the side of the bladed arm, and dived right into the chest. Punching it right in the centre, Quinn could feel the hard crystal body, it had next to no give, but would he give up here? 

There wasn't a chance that he would, swinging both of his arms, he was hammering the chest, with his flowing red aura, rippling out in the air one after the other.

The shockwaves were powerful and even reached the champion that was a distance away and still tied up. The punches were coming out in a flurry, one after the other, and the champion was able to notice something. 

'The power, the strikes, I'm hearing twice the amount of shockwaves compared to the attacks I'm seeing, is this his power as well. No demons have had abilities that are this unique?' The champion thought. 

Still, there was a large doubt in his head that the newcomer would win the fight, and the reason was simple. Maybe if he was fighting any other demon, the damage from the constant powerful attacks would accumulate, but the attacks on the Durum demon king, Kronker, none of these attacks were getting through.

Out from the chest that Quinn was attacking, the crystal's started to shift, and he could sense something was coming. From the area he was attacking a red crystal grew out like a spike, Quinn dodged the spike attack, and threw out a fist hitting it from underneath. 

As his fist hit the red spike, his hand had completely stopped, unable to break the crystal. Several more sharp spikes came out from Kronker's chest all aiming towards Quinn, but he was able to move out of the way quick enough as he jumped back a few times. 

In the middle of jumping back, Quinn had formed a huge blood spear and hurled it through the air right toward the demon. Swinging the bladed arm, it broke right through the red spear with no resistance.

The red swirling mist around his bladed arm also started to almost consume the blood spear, breaking down the energy and adding it to its own. The arm glowed a bright red for a moment and the red mist continued to swirl on the outside. 

'Can they absorb pure blood aura? My attack might have just made him stronger, and if he can absorb blood aura, it's not exactly something I want to test.'

"Your demon power is weak! Do you know nothing about us? How have you managed to survive this long!" Kronker said. 

If there was one thing the demon king had to admit, it was that the attacker was nimble. He was fast and the shadow power had some strange attacks up its sleeve. Maybe if this one was slightly stronger, or had a few more tricks up their sleeve, then he would be a worthwhile opponent, perhaps not against him but the other demons that weren't as sturdy as him, but as he was, this person was not a threat. 

"I'm done playing with you, I know you have nothing left to show!" Kronker lifted his bladed hand up, even though he was too far away to reach Quinn. I think you should take a look at

As the bladed hand was in the air, all of the red mist that was swirling around it had gathered to the tip. It then spread out, just as the blade swung down and hit the floor. 

In case it was some type of slashing attack, or something like the blood swipe, Quinn was ready to move out of the way. The moment the bladed part hit the floor though, the hand had just burst into tiny fragments of crystal. It looked like glitter had been thrown in the air, and almost looked like a mist that surrounded the front of the demon king. 

"Try and avoid this!" 

Quinn had a bad feeling about what was to come next, and started to gather his shadow, it was the best bet he had against whatever was about to come. All of the red small shards of crystal started to sparkle, and before he knew it, they were all heading right out towards Quinn. 

Shadow raised in front of him, but small holes could be seen breaking through the shadow, and when it broke through the shadow, with nowhere for the clone to move, the moment one of the crystal shards went through its body, it had exploded into nothing but a cloud of smoke. 

The red shards of crystal started to move back, all of the glitter in the air formed back around the arm turning it back into a regular hand and fist rather than a bladed part. 

"All of the energy disappeared after that cloud of smoke… did they die just from a simple attack like that. I find that hard to believe." Kronker said. 

However, he had to believe it, because there was no sign, nor energy in the air. How could one who produced such powerful attacks die so easily? Perhaps it was just a demon created that way, one that was meant to focus on power.

Turning, he started to look at the champion that was chained up.

"I guess that little hope you had now has disappeared." 

"Hope." The champion replied. "I had no hope when I saw him." 

The demon king walked up to the giant pillars and brushed his hand against the edge. The chains started to come off from the pillar, and wrapped tighter around the champion's arms covering more of its body.

"It's your lucky day today. It seems that there are still problems going on around the place. It is my job to make sure no one breaks you free, you see." Kronker explained as he continued to disconnect the large chains from the pillars wrapping around the champion's body.

"Now that the magic circle has been activated, I would have to create a new one to summon me. So the only option I have is to take you with me. So you're going to get to leave this place for a while." 

Eventually, after taking off all the chains from the pillars, with one of the hands still crystallised like a blade, he swiped it at the back of the champion's foot, causing a deep, large cut. Then he stabbed it right through the calf muscle before pulling it out again, and doing the same to the other leg. 

"The chains should be enough to keep you tied up, but I need to make sure that if you do escape that you're an easy fight for me, or you won't get very far."

The demon king then knelt down, and out from his turtle like back, the crystals extended into small spikes sticking into the skin of the champion. It had been done in such a way, so it was enough for the champion's body to be stuck onto the back of the demon.

"Let's see who's causing all of this mess in the hunting grounds."
