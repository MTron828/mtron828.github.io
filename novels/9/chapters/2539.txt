Chapter 2540 ¬†The Decision Is Made

Quinn's emotions were all over the place. Seeing Sam at a time like this, next to Bliss who he really didn't have much of a liking for, and she was by Mundus, someone who had trapped him before, but also someone he had worked with.

There were words being thrown out by everyone, and although it felt like they were all somewhat telling the truth, it also felt like there were lies hidden behind each of their points.

"I've decided already, I'm ending it right here!" Quinn shouted, as he jumped up in the air, and swung the giant drill right down toward Immortui's body.

Those that were close by, Mundus along with Bliss and the others, the orb surrounding them flickered and they quickly disappeared out of the area.

The large dark blood shadow drill hit Immortui's body, and was spinning constantly. The power of the attack, it was ripping his skin away bit by bit, and disintegrating into nothing but energy as it was added into the drill.

"ARGHHH!" Quinn screamed and his demon form was breaking. It was falling off of him as the attack and energy waves hit his body.

He needed to make sure, that this was it, that this would be the end of Immortui once and for all. The large drill pushed down and it continued to push further and further. The ground was breaking off the giant planet, and the cracks were going out further and further out.

They continued to spread and the energy was causing everything to crumble. The drill, it had hit the very core of the planet, and the energy at that point had exploded out. Everything in sight was crumbling to pieces, only a few areas of land had broken off and were floating in space.

The large explosions as well as the shockwave from the attack had moved nearly everything close to it far out and wide.

When the energy had finally come to an end, the planet that was once there was no more, and instead Quinn was just floating in space. He looked at the air around him, and that's when he started to notice something.

The red mist that was covering the entire space, it was fading away, it was disappearing right in front of his eyes. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

'Was this energy, was it all of Immortui's power?' Quinn thought.

Clenching his fist, he had done so weakly, his fingers moving slowly. 'I've made my decision now, I have to live with my choice.'

Quinn thought, and in that moment, the system had given him a ping, reading him another message.

Across the red space, a big change was happening. Although many of the demons had gathered onto their large ships and had headed for the planet of the giants. There were those that had stayed behind, and they felt a strange tingling sensation in their body.

Their forms were starting to change, the surging power they felt in their body nearly all of it was disappearing from them. They started to shrink down in size, and began to lose many of their demonic features.

As this was taken away from them, they started to look a lot more human. Their skin was normal, their flesh was the same as any human, but they didn't have the power that they had before, and unlike humans they had no abilities.

"Look at them!" one of the Chrono shouted. "The demons‚Ä¶ something's happened!"

Immediately, one of the Chrono had picked up a weapon, an axe, and ran, slicing the former demon's head right off. The body fell to the floor and it was dead in an instant.

Although the red mist had disappeared, no longer influencing this innate anger to fight each other, there was real anger behind their actions. All of the years they had suffered, they could now unleash it back on the demons.

The demons themselves had no clue what was happening or what had happened to them, but they stood no chance as the inhabitants took back the red space.

Due to the blast of Quinn's attack, there was one being that had been knocked so far away, he found himself on another planet, and he too had changed into a human-like form.

"What is this?" Unzoku said, looking at his pale hand. "Does this mean, Immortui actually lost, his plan had failed? Then what does that mean for me‚Ä¶ I need to survive for now.

In the vampire settlement, the fighting had been over for a short while. Everyone was quick to act as they had gathered those that were injured and among the rubble. They pulled them out and started to heal them as quickly as possible.

For the vampires, they gave them blood allowing their bodies to do the natural healing. It was a tough time for them all, as they tried their best to cope with the losses around them.

Loud screams were heard throughout from the attack.

Using his machinery, Logan had cleared a lot of the rubble away after confirming there were no more vampires among the rubble. It had been pushed over to the side, and the injured were being treated.

As for the dead, they were placed in another location for now. A short while later, and being escorted by some of the Vampire Corps and Andy, Minny along with the rest of the children had arrived.

"Mum!" Minny shouted as she started to sprint across the ground, but as she did she noticed something. Her steps were becoming slower, the energy inside her, it was disappearing from her body. She started to feel incredibly slow, and her heartbeat was starting to grow stronger as well.

Her breath, she could feel it more vividly, and also the pain in her legs as she went across the area. It wasn't just her though, every single vampire in the area could feel it as well. There was a big change that was happening in them all. A change that they couldn't stop, and had no control of.

Inside the floating space around Quinn, he was looking at the system screen that had popped up in front of him.

[Quest complete] [You have defeated the Celestial of Death] [You have gained the following rewards]

[Your powers have become your own. You will not be affected by the Celestial of Death's clawback ability.]

'Clawback ability, what is this? I don't even know what it means, but the Celestial of Death, it's clear that it's talking about Immortui.'

Right now, Quinn could still feel the blood aura in his body. He could still feel the flow of blood in the air, including the blood that was being split now on the other planets. Because of this, he knew he hadn't lost his powers.

[An item has been placed in your system] [Immortui's soul]

[You can do the following with Immortui's soul Crystal] [Place it into another that is compatible with the soul] [Break the soul crystal sending it into the path of Reincarnation]

'This‚Ä¶ It's a crystal and it's in my system. Just like the god slayer crystals? Can this happen, has this ever happened before? Or is it because of the system itself? It has always been able to do strange things due to the Equivalent Exchange ability.

'So what happens if I just keep the crystal in the system. Will it mean, Immortui will never enter the reincarnation cycle? He will never cause trouble again.'

Judging by the fact that the system didn't require him to do anything, he thought that very well was a possibility. It looked like Immortui's claim of always being a worry in Quinn's mind wouldn't exist.

On top of that, it was a handy thing to keep, because now he also had a bargaining chip that he could use with the other Celestials as well. Or a deep secret to keep with him. Thinking of them, a glowing orb started to appear and once again the three from before had appeared in front of him.

"You did it Quinn." Bliss said with a smile on her face. "It looks like once again, with the help of two Talens you have managed to change the future and for the better."

"Two Talens?" Quinn replied back wondering what she meant by that, but he was so exhausted that he didn't really have the energy to care either.

"As a thank you, Quinn, for doing all this, I will take you back to the Golden Space," Mundus said. "You will finally be able to spend time with your family and friends without having to worry."

"The celestials will not bother you, and Immortui will no longer bother you until he needs to reincarnate again, but that will be our trouble to deal with, not yours."

Those words finally brought Quinn peace. He had felt like he had achieved that so many times before, but there was always problem after problem. Was it true? Could he finally enjoy himself?

Shifting in, Bliss used some of her magic and pulled Quinn into the glowing white orb that the three of them were in. He didn't fight it, but now he was right by the side of the others.

And it was at that moment that he noticed something. The smell that had entered his nose, and the energy coming off from Sam's body.

"You... You don't smell like a vampire. What happened to you?" Quinn asked, his heart pounding.

"Quinn," Sam replied with a straight face. "What Immortui said‚Ä¶ wasn't a lie. His power is no longer a part of this universe‚Ä¶ apart from what is inside you. You are the last vampire."
