Chapter 1215 Last wish

Before leaving the place, Quinn wanted to check with Ko, the faction leader, if they would now be okay with him leaving. As he was ready to leave the faction base, he had Linda and Wevil following behind and had stopped by his office. The base itself was one of the few places that had been least affected by the attack and was also doubling up as a safe centre for civilians. This Shelter has suffered a lot, and even more so since the Graylash faction were unable to help them like they had done on the other planets.

Quinn still felt like he was partly to blame, perhaps if he had found out what was the cause of the Marked and what the Demon tier beast was earlier, more could have survived, especially Robin.

"Quinn, honestly I heard about all the other bases being attacked and I have seen part of the Broadcast. I'm quite surprised you even came here, but you don't have to worry about us. The stray Dalki left out there will take a while until they do anything. Besides we are a strong faction."

Hearing this had settled Quinn's heart a little, for he had planned to take the other Cursed members back with him. Usually, Quinn would try to complete quests on his own, but he knew he needed all the help he could get.

"I know these people belong to the Graylash faction, but you and I have been through a lot. The teleporters to the Daisy planet are up and running. I believe it's one of the only few places that are. If there is a sudden attack, then the safest place to retreat to would be there." Quinn answered.

With that said and done, Quinn was ready to leave the base and outside was the last member of the Cursed faction. Alex Stood there waiting, but he wasn't alone and he looked kind of nervous.

"What the?" Wevil commented, rubbing his eyes. "Am I seeing things, or does that large muscular man have the same set of wings as Alex as well?" Wevil asked.

Quinn was about to ask the same thing but now knowing that it wasn't some type of hallucination, he soon used his inspect skill.

[Blood fairy]

'Another Blood fairy? His wings are twice the size Alex's, but then again, Andrew is twice the size of him as well. For a second I thought he might have been another subclass.'

Knowing that the forger Andrew worked closely together with Alex, Quinn had an idea of what most likely happened.

'I warn you that this will be another thing that will need to be hidden from the vampire society. One of them, you could perhaps play it off as a subclass that you never intended to create, but with two, there is a good chance that any of the leaders could use this as a case that you were planning to go against them.' Vincent warned.

'At the moment that is the least of my worries. If Alex wishes to save someone he feels is close to him and worth saving, then I will agree with his decision and support him.' Quinn replied. Upstodatee from n(0)/vùíÜ/lbIn/.(co/m

There was also another reason why Quinn wasn't so against the idea of having two blood fairies. Andrew was considered one of the top forgers in the world and Quinn was thinking of ways to convince him over to their side.

"Quinn, look I can explain." Alex started to get defensive, and by the look on Andrew's face, it looked like Alex had already gone over explaining the difficult part of things.

"Don't worry, I'm sure you had your reasons. Come on, we need to get out of here." Quinn said, as they headed to a special room located around the back of the main faction building. A place where all the teleporters had been placed. It seemed like the Dalki didn't even bother to attack such a place since they knew that they were unable to use them and it was why Quinn had to destroy the mothership despite the fact that it didn't help out with his Quest.

"When we get back, Linda, Wevil, I want you two to head to one of the Cursed planets KunKun, I will be heading to a different one to the two of you. Make sure you keep your shadow abilities active at all times. That way I can hop over to where you are when I can." Quinn ordered.

"Wait, don't you think it will be safer if we all go together. I know your strong Quinn, but there might also be Dalki that even we can't face." Linda replied. "We were struggling there enough as it is."

It was hard for Quinn to say why, because really he was doing it mainly due to his quest, but that would mean he would have to explain the system to them all.

"The Dalki seemed to be building a base of some kind on each of the planets, and at the same time none of the Shelters could get help due to the teleporters being jammed. We need to get rid of those teleporters as quickly as possible. The only way to travel at the moment is via ship. If we both head to different planets. Once I am done dealing with the mothership on my end, I can use my shadow link to travel to you two.

"The idea is, me and Alex will travel towards the Cursed faction in one sector. While you two in the other. After dealing with the mother ship, I'll hop over to you two and deal with the Dalki there, while Alex makes his way to another planet, and soon hop back."

To the Cursed members there it sounded like a lot of work, but they had learnt that somehow Quinn was already able to take out two of the Dalki ships. It was clear that this was something that only he could do.

"Quinn, I also managed to finish this." Alex said, handing over Quinn's red mask that he had given to Alex a while ago. "I managed to use that upgraded crystal and it looks like it worked. I increased it from the emperor tier and now it's at the legendary tier. I know you're plenty strong already, but every little bit helps, right?"

Using his inspect skill, Quinn looked at the stats of the mask. Originally it was an incomplete emperor tier item so it didn't grant the user much. But it did have a passive skill that allowed one's adrenaline points to rise, which in turn could boost a single stat.

"Alex, bringing you along will be dangerous. You don't have the best equipment yourself. Even here you had to face some trouble, so I think it's best if you keep it, and I don't want you or Andrew to wait any longer. Make yourselves the best equipment you can. You have to protect yourselves before you can protect others.

"The same goes for you Quinn." Alex said smiling.

Returning to the Daisy planet, Quinn could see that things were good here. The walls were just as intact as they were before, a few members were injured but they were light injuries. It seemed while he was away the few Dalki that were still out and about on the planet, had attempted an attack, but had failed.

[3/10 planets lost]

Looking at the Quest, Quinn didn't even have time to explain to Helen what he was doing but just quickly updated her on everything. Telling her that he had informed people that they could come to them for protection. He also requested another ship, for Wevil and Linda's use.

Helen had returned to give Quinn the news that both of the ships he had requested were ready.

"Wait Quinn, with the teleporters active, more people from the planets will start to come to the Shelter. I'm sure the Dalki will catch on to this, and they may even target this planet again as an excuse for it. Which is why I can't go with you, but I have received news and the other planets need help. So eight of the blood weapon users that helped fight with you before are coming with you. I have split them up into two groups to go along with you."

Last time, two of them had lost their lives because they had decided to come and help Quinn, but he couldn't deny that they could help fight off the enemies at the Shelter while he did what he needed to do.

"Thank you." Quinn answered as he was ready to leave, turning around, he soon felt someone grab his hand and pull him in. Based on the strength used, he knew it wasn't an enemy and soon saw the one pulling him was Helen.

Her face went in close to his, his mind was freezing in the moment, and before he knew it she had grabbed him by the scruff off his neck and pulled him in. Pressing her lips against his.

'There so‚Ä¶soft..'Quinn thought at that moment.

She had let go, and had a guilty look on her face.

"I'm sorry Quinn, but I just had to be even more selfish just this once. If I told you I wasn't scared I would be lying. With the war going on, I have already seen people dying and getting reports from all the other planets. There is a good chance that maybe you and I will never see each other again after this, and if I didn't kiss you at least once. I would have died with a huge regret."

After saying these words, Helen looked at Quinn expecting some sort of answer from him, and Quinn could see this as well, but while thinking about her, another girl had popped into his head.

'Quinn, don't not now, instead use this to encourage her.' Vincent came in before Quinn could say what he was about to say.

"I wont accept it. I won't accept that as your last wish. You want to experience more things like this right? Well then live and don't die, that way you have the chance to experience it again, because I won't be dying."
