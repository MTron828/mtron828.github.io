The soul weapon was an interesting thing that had been discovered a while ago, and in Quinn's case it was even more different compared to others. For one, a person usually only had one soul weapon, an enhancement type or an item type, that would be related to their ability.

Yet for some reason Quinn had both. He still wasn't sure about the explanation for this. Was it because he was a human that changed into a vampire around the time that a soul weapon would manifest?

At first, it was thought that vampires could not manifest soul weapons, but thanks to Fex they had found out it wasn't true. But then why don't vampires have two soul weapons if they had abilities as well?

Thinking about it more, Quinn thought maybe it was to do with his ability itself. His ability, after all, was a god slayer ability and in a sense they could break rules that normal abilities were unable to.

Either way, Quinn had two types of soul weapons that helped him out in the past in countless ways. Ever since receiving the blood guns he didn't resort to such attacks, but he did before when he was a celestial.

What he had found was that his item type soul weapon had changed with his celestial form. Since the weapon was linked to his blood and his blood was no longer normal, it was filled with celestial energy.

This special trait allowed him to form the weapons into anything he wished, and it had great celestial power with it. The thing was, Quinn was no longer a celestial. During his peaceful times, he did try to use his soul weapon.

He never knew when he might need to use it or improve it, and as he feared, he was no longer able to do what he could before. The Twin Tail Chains would still work, but that was all and they were unable to take other shapes.

However, it wasn't all bad news, he was now a god slayer after all, and this was due to his shadow ability in the first place and was what his enhancement type soul weapon was based on. In the past, it allowed him to create a shadow body, control the shadow from a limited range without having to be connected with his own shadow and unlimited MC cells for a period of time.

The thing was, when he had accepted to become a god slayer, his shadow had evolved. What was once his soul weapon, he was able to do with the shadow naturally and he had obtained a few new skills all linked to shadow infect.

Which led to the question, just like when he had become a celestial and his other soul weapon had evolved, did it mean that his shadow soul weapon had evolved? He was already able to completely dull out an opponent's senses with his shadow bullets, but in this case, the shadow wasn't sticking onto his opponent.

[Soul weapon activated]

The second Quinn had activated his soul weapon, the shadow on his body started to flicker violently like a fire, and just like a flame, what looked like smoke was lingering off from his body and being spread out.

The shadow flames on Quinn's body were starting to have a small glow around him, as his soul weapon went into the final phase.

[Soul weapon, Shadow Mist is now being used]

The shadow pulsed out from his body like a wave, going in all directions like a sphere. As it went out wider and wider, the sphere of shadow was leaving a mist of shadow in the air, the colour of everything around them in the fighting area, all of it was turning a slight purple.

'The soul weapon is always used as a last resort, it's a double edged sword. If I can't beat him during the use of my soul weapon, then when it runs out I'll be exhausted. Even my regular hits and punches will be weaker than usual.'

The monkey god slayer, was wondering what all this lingering mist around him was, he started to waft his hand and even attempted to kick the air, but it did nothing. Then, shrinking his weapon and placing it back in his hand, he swung the staff through the mist. It created a large force of wind, but didn't move the mist away.

It only broke through it for a few seconds but the mist still lingered and stayed in the area. Finally, the monkey man slammed his staff on the ground, shooting out the golden aura he used, but just like when swinging the staff, although it was able to push the mist away temporarily, it returned just as quickly as soon as the energy disappeared.

'This mist, it doesn't make me feel any different.' The monkey man thought. 'But it has to do something, but there is no point in worrying about it now, I have to focus on the fight.'

The monkey man was ready to run forward but as soon as he took a step, red blood bullets came towards him, firing out from both guns as Quinn stayed in his position.

Using the staff, he was able to hit most of the bullets away, while avoiding a few of them as well.

'This is useless, it didn't work before, so why is he trying to do the same thing again?'

The blood bullets weren't the only thing the god slayer had to worry about, as Quinn had summoned a number of blood swords as well. Yet for some reason they had stayed in the air, rather than attacking.

The monkey man was getting annoyed, although he could block the bullets and avoid them easily, it was hard for him to progress forward. He could extend his staff again, but was wondering if that really was the best thing for him to do.

Instead, he created more clones of himself to help with the bullets, but the second he did, the blood swords started to move, and with how many they were, they had pierced the clones, finishing them off.

'Now I see, that's what the blood swords were for.' The monkey man thought.

While thinking this, when he moved to avoid another bullet, it had shaved his skin causing a tiny cut on it. For now he ignored this as a tiny slip up. Yet, as time went on by just a second, he was getting skimmed by the bullets more and more.

'Am I moving slower‚Ä¶ not just that, I feel weaker, but I'm not tired?' the god slayer thought.

Quinn's soul weapon was starting to take effect, with the shadow in a mist form, it meant in some way it was always touching his opponent and slowly all of the effects of the shadow would work on his opponent.

Their senses would begin to dull, their sight would blur, their hearing disappearing, and their sense of touch fading. While at the same time, their movements and abilities would work slower than before.

It wasn't as strong as if the shadow was directly touching its opponent, but the mist was a sure way for one to get affected by the shadow. There was no way to escape it, other than running away from the fight.

Mundus, who had been watching the fight go on, realised the effects of the shadow mist.

'In some ways, this ability is quite similar to mine, slowing down the opponent, although mine is more powerful.' Mundus thought,. Yet he was annoyed for another reason. 'This shadow mist, if it's in the air, would it also be able to block out my ability from working properly? That along with the shadow body would make Quinn a difficult opponent to face.'

Eventually, as the monkey man started to slow down, the bullets were hitting him more and more, and a clean shot had hit him right in the chest causing him to grind his teeth.

"That's it, Extend!" The monkey man shouted out, thrusting his weapon forward, planning to hit Quinn like he had before, but seconds before that Quinn had moved his hand, as he did, it moved the shadow of the monkey man, and in turn moved the real monkey man's hand.

The extended staff had gone in a completely different direction, crashing through the broken buildings that were at the side.

Sprinting forward, blood aura started to surround both of Quinn's hands. It swirled around and started to spin, looking like drills, more and more blood gathered as the drills grew in size.

'The shadow mist does a few more things. The shadow in its mist form being in the air means that it's impossible for you to not breathe it in. The shadow particles are growing in your body, and in turn that allows me to control your own shadow somewhat.

'The more particles, the easier it is to control your shadow and control you.'

The monkey man had no clue what was going on, but retracted his staff to go back into his hand in a small form, and swung it down toward Quinn's head. Yet in that moment once again, using the shadow particles in the monkey's body, he was able to move the strike to go to the side and completely miss him, leaving him wide open.

"I'm sorry!" Quinn shouted, as he thrust the two large blood aura drills right into the monkey man's body. The blood aura started to spin at an intense speed and the lingering parts of the blood aura was cutting up the skin on his face and body.

Lifting his arms up, Quinn had lifted the monkey man in the air with both of the drills, blood was pouring from his mouth down onto the ground. As the drills' attack was coming to an end, Quinn had quickly switched to the guns and fired away.

It hit the weak and slow monkey on the chest repeatedly, keeping him up in the air, as powerful condensed blood bullet after bullet had hit him. Shooting a shadow bullet below, and one above Quinn sunk into the ground, and when he appeared out of the shadow above, he had his gauntlets on his hand.

His hand was in a claw-like shape and his trailing blood aura had the appearance of a tiger. From above, his fist slammed into the monkey man's back and his nails pierced through the armour.

Pushing him with the power, his claw ripped through his body as the two of them slammed back onto the ground.
