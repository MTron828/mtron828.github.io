Chapter 1036 - Making a deal everywhere

Quinn wanted to act without Eno knowing what he had planned for now, that way he couldn‚Äôt play any of his games on him. At the same time, choosing either of the options relied on Eno quite a bit which Quinn didn‚Äôt like.

Still, for his new plan to work there were many moving parts he would have to do himself, and he also needed to check if it was possible. Him and Logan would have to work closely on this one, while making it seem like Quinn had chosen one of the options for now.

As for Eno, he had been left to his own devices, allowing him to travel around the Cursed ship along with his ‚Äôfriend‚Äô Brock. Although the relationship between the two still wasn‚Äôt clear. The Cursed leaders apart from Megan who was still in the dark about the others‚Äô secrets, were to keep an eye on Eno when they could.

Although, ever since the broadcast, everywhere Eno went it was hard to not know where he was, for even the Cursed faction members wanted to talk to him and knew who he was.

When talking to the regular members on board, he had asked simple questions about the Cursed faction, such as when did they join and what do they think of the group. It didn‚Äôt seem like he was stirring up trouble like with the main leaders.

After so much observing, they found out that Eno was really doing what he said, just wandering around and observing. Quinn couldn‚Äôt stay with him forever so It was deemed fine to leave him alone.

Of course, one of the only reasons this was allowed was because of Logan, who had access to the cameras around the Cursed ship, and also had one of his small spiders following Eno at all times, but he wasn‚Äôt an idiot. He knew most likely Eno and Brock had an idea they were being followed, and could turn off or interfere with his equipment.

Eno was one of the few smart people who could actually go against Logan, but if anything strange did occur, then that would also be a sign and Quinn would be informed straight away.

Currently, Logan while working away on what Quinn had tasked him with, was watching what Eno was doing. The pair of goggles he would usually wear over his eyes while he did work, was showing a video feed that allowed Logan to see everything in the top left hand corner.

At the same time, he could concentrate on doing his work, and through his ability the spider would inform him if it thought it had seen anything suspicious as well, in case there were a few things he had missed.

As for what Eno was doing at this very moment, he had entered a training room that was producing noise even through the soundproof rooms. It was also clear that the other members of the Cursed faction were avoiding the room, so naturally Eno was interested.

When he entered the room along with Brock, the sound of constant clashes could be heard even clearer now, and in the training room, sparks were flying off while two swords were doing battle.

"Did you sense them?" Leo asked, as he continued his strike and it was blocked by Erin.

"Of course!" She shouted back, trying to swing a heavy strike of her own, but she was tired and overextended, allowing her body weight to shift for a brief second. Leo used this to move in and gave Erin a shoulder barge as she came in, knocking her to the ground.

Both of them were completely covered in sweat. For vampires, this was incredibly rare as it took a lot for them, based on how large their stamina was. Even when training, hardly anyone pushed their bodies to this point.

"Let‚Äôs stop for now." Leo said, it wasn‚Äôt because their tank was empty, but he just didn‚Äôt like the fact that the guests were watching their every move, and Leo and Erin had some secrets they didn‚Äôt want to particularly share with outsiders.

"Oh, you two don‚Äôt have to stop just because we came in, it was just getting good." Eno said with a smile. As the fight ended as well, Erin‚Äôs hair started to change back from the black colour going to its original blonde.

This was something that she had eventually learnt to control based on who she was around at the moment. However, when battling using certain strength it would change to black. Eno looked at this and it looked as if he wanted to say something but had decided not to.

"Brock." Leo called out. "Is this the master that you spoke of before?"

"It is." Brock replied.

Leo started to walk up to the two of them, and was cautious while Erin followed from behind.

"Although the two of us have not met, I hope I am not rude by requesting this." Leo bowed. " I was hoping you could help me with some information." Leo asked, looking towards Eno.

"Ah yes, Brock did inform me that someone was quite interested in Pure, I assume that you would be the one, but you must not know me very well and if you don‚Äôt you will do. I only tell people what I wish, if they are to do me a favour or have something that I want in return. An equivalent exchange.

"Information on the Pure leader‚Äôs appearance is very valuable information, which means you would owe me quite the big favour." Eno said with a smile. "So I would be happy to tell you, as long as you comply with one of my requests."

When looking at Eno, something was sending goosebumps inside Erin‚Äôs body. She didn‚Äôt like this person. She had felt this way when seeing someone else from the vampire world, which was Bryce. Someone who didn‚Äôt seem like an outright bad person, but it didn‚Äôt mean they weren‚Äôt a bad person.

"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, but then I must decline," Leo replied. "If it is information worth warranting a deal over, then perhaps I shouldn‚Äôt know about it in the first place."

Brock could tell that his master was quite surprised by this person‚Äôs response. It was clear that Leo was very interested in knowing who the Pure leader was, but then why wouldn‚Äôt he attempt to make a deal?

"Maybe you can help me with another thing," Leo said. "Perhaps you could inform me and tell me, who do you think is stronger? Surely you must know the Pure leader‚Äôs strength?" Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

"I would say I have a pretty good idea, but I do not know your strength so I would be unable to find out that answer." Eno replied.

After that, Leo didn‚Äôt say anything else, and just decided to walk past Eno with Erin following behind him, leaving the room. For a second, Eno was left there in his own thoughts, thinking about what had just happened.

----

It followed him into his room and followed him everywhere, not noticing anything out of the ordinary, and Eno had gone to sleep.

Meanwhile, in the hallway itself, another figure that looked exactly like Eno was standing outside of a certain door.

‚ÄôThe Green boy is suspicious of me but I don‚Äôt blame him. He is doing well and this is how he should act. However, he is unaware of what I can do, and that is where he will fail.‚Äô

Seemingly entering the room, he was silent, walking towards the bed. The person‚Äôs blonde hair could be seen, trailing off her bed.

‚ÄôA Dhampir is no one‚Äôs friend. It might be better off to kill her now before she causes more trouble for everyone.‚Äô Eno thought.

Taking a step forward, his hand was glowing red, and his eyes at the same time, but he stopped. Almost hesitating with what to do.

‚ÄôShould I really interfere? The Cursed faction has done well because of the group of people Quinn has managed to surround himself with. This may ruin everything.‚Äô

Letting the red aura go, Eno turned around, only to have a blade pointed towards his neck, and the one holding the sword was the bald blind man he had seen earlier.

"Maybe we will find out the answer to my question."
