Chapter Ôªø1892 Next Target

Walking out of the cave after having just defeated the Demon tier beast, Agent 4 continued to walk into the direction where the two large energy readings were coming from.

Zero was getting somewhat impatient as he had a big smile on his face. His hands were twitching during the walk, if he could, he wanted to personally test Erin, and after seeing what she had done and sensing the energy inside her.

'I thought that the dhampirs' strength was mainly from their own personal aura. I knew that the dhampirs also learned Qi, but I never expected to find someone that has managed to cultivate their Qi to this level.' Zero thought, as he imagined what it would be like to use the Qi drain skill on her.

It would mean all of the power and all of the strength that Erin had would be added to Zero's strength. Then he could achieve what he needed to achieve, and if a certain individual was to back out of their deal, he would also be able to make them pay.

However, there was a reason why Agent 4 was walking rather than running to the scene, because he was carefully following the two large energy readings they were going towards.

On the device, the energy readings appear as circles. The colour of the circles changed from a red to a green and an array of different colours depending on how strong the reading was.

At the same time, once in a while, the circles would get bigger depending on when their energy was used. That was why it was very strange that every time there was a rumble, the ground shook like a volcano was going off, and the energy sources would get larger.

'Without a doubt, all this shaking, it has to be coming from these energy sources. What creatures have the power to make it feel like an eruption and earthquake is going off, even though we are so far away.'

According to the map, there were at least another 100 miles away. Of course, for them, this distance could be covered quickly if they were all to run at their full speed.

Picking up the pace, Agent 4 headed in that direction as his fear turned into interest. Just what type of weapons and armour could be created from such things?

As they continued to move though, Agent 4 noticed something else, and it was the fact that many of the energy sources that he believed were Demon tier beasts were starting to disappear.

Not just any, but the ones that were closest to the large energy sources they were heading towards.

'Zero you claimed that you wanted a challenge, well this is probably going to be the biggest challenge we have, but with the Blood armour that can block any attack, we should be fine.' Agent 4 thought while he was playing out the scene in his head‚Ä¶ it had to be fine.

Eventually, Agent 4 slowed down as the magnitude of the rumbling grew louder. The shaking was so violent that explosions of lava had shot up from the ground.

"Just what is happening?" Flora asked.

"I think I can see it now‚Ä¶ it's a fight." Zero replied.

There were several broken rocks that had been stuck in the ground creating what looked like small hills. On a closer inspection, they weren't naturally there. It looked almost as if the ground had been pushed out in such a way, similar to the debris of an explosion.

When standing on top of these hills they could see the ground had somewhat changed. The hard black exterior had somewhat been removed and now several pits of lava, as well as small looking veins of lava could be seen on the ground everywhere.

The heat from the ground was also immense. If the group were to travel on it, they would have to use their Qi to protect themselves, but their attention wasn't focused on that, it was on what was going on ahead of them.

On one side, they could see a red skinned muscular man, with a single horn sticking out of his head. It rose up high, almost as large as an arm. On its body there seemed to be strange circular balls as well.

Meanwhile, on the other side not too far from it, there was a giant Wyrm. A beast with a long large thick body and the head of what looked like a dragon. Its tail split in two at the end, and all over the dragon there was the same red vein-like material like that of the planet.

It looked like a vicious beast, almost godly. The radiating energy that was coming from it, it was too strong to be called just a demon tier beast. The one that could tell this the most was Erin, because she had the ability to sense its power.

'If I was to go up against that‚Ä¶ it would be a tough fight.' She knew this, yet even though she knew this, the other human-like figure was the one that intrigued her even more.

Because the energy that she was seeing now, it was a white energy, an energy that she had seen only a few times before. Of those that seemed incredibly special, and it was a similar energy to the one that Zero was hiding.

He hid it well, to those outside, because he could condense the energy inside him, but Erin could still feel it.

'What are the similarities between these two?' Erin thought.

The Wyrm started to slither on the ground, and opened its mouth. Out from it several rings of fire had gone towards the other figure. Leaping off the ground, he seemed to avoid them all.

"You think I would let those rings touch me? I would never have lived this long if that was the case." the man said. He charged in, and the Wyrm noticing this charged in as well.

The strange balls that were embedded into the man, started to spin, and sparks of energy started to come out. Using his hand, he held it out with his fingers straight and swung it down right in the middle of the beast.

Its body continued moving forward and as it did, the hand from the man sliced right through the beast. It continued to move forward until it reached its tail and the beast had been completely sliced in half.

The beast was no longer moving, and it looked like the fight was over. Strangely, the man walked over to the beast and it appeared that something strange was starting to happen.

Right where the beast had been killed, Erin could see it, energy was gathering in a certain area, and finally, as it condensed, a crystal appeared just like that.

'The crystal, it wasn't inside the beast, to begin with, but I could see the energy moving from the beast, the dead body, to that location‚Ä¶ What type of crystal is this?'Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Erin was unaware that what she was witnessing right now, was the creation of a God Slayer crystal. Something that was unable to be destroyed. Even if the crystal was destroyed its energy and power would form somewhere else, which was why it was best for the celestials to just keep it themselves.

Lifting it up in the air, the crystal soon disappeared.

For a second, the man paused, and then when he moved again he looked in the distance towards where Zero and Erin were.

"A grand task has been bestowed upon me. They stated that they were the ones on my planet. It seems they were correct, but I was unaware of how close they would be. I, Gorgath, will continue to complete the tasks that are ahead of me."

The strange balls that were embedded into Gorgath's foot started to spin once more, and the others knew to take it as a sign that he was now coming toward them.

Immediately, Agent 4 lifted his hand and started to activate the blood power even before Gorgath had moved. It was a good thing he had done so, because in a flash, Gorgath was right in front of the blood wall having slammed into it.

"I will eliminate you both!" Gorgath declared, while attempting to break through.
