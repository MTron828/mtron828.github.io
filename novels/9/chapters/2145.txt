The grand event of the Penswi was about to begin and Quinn along with Russ were getting ready in their rooms. They had to wear the clothing of the Dark Red's which was a red and black which was fine for Quinn as he thought it made him look quite stylish and they suited the colours that he would have picked.

After everyone was changed, the first event would be announced and then each team would have fifteen minutes to decide who from their team would be best to send out for that event. The interesting thing was that the same person could compete more than once.

However, the problem was, at least what Russ and Quinn found, that even though a lot of games were to do with speed, they sucked at most of them. There was a lot of strategy involved in these games as well as just being fast so they would have to wait for something that suited them.

'I saw the King and Queen, up there on the stage, honestly I could just go over there in my shadow and pop out, but they might think I was threatening them, when I'm trying to get them on my side.' Quinn thought.

There was another reason why he was somewhat interested in this event though, and that was to see how strong the Penswi were and how useful they would be in a fight against Jim and Jack.

The Amra on average were incredibly strong, close to that of the Dalki, and there were even those that were stronger than the Dalki. The Mermerials were around the same strength of most of the vampires, as long as they had water near them, but what could the Penswi do? How could they be of help in the battle? Why did Bliss and Sam send him here?

The first event was selected and it was essentially what humans knew as a bleep test. All participants would have to run from one side, to another side before the second beep was heard.

The interval between each beep would speed up, as time went on and if one couldn't get to the other side before the beep they would be eliminated. This test was not just about speed but also about stamina and pacing oneself.

Because it was relatively a long game, neither Russ nor Quinn would be taking part. Russ was unsure how long he could keep his transformation up, and to win the game he would have to appear as Stark.

They didn't want to stir up the crowd just yet. In the end, the group sent out someone who went by the name Tither.

"Finally, at least we'll get to see just how great this Stark person is, right?" Russ said.

It was true, and Quinn was looking forward to it. The event had started and they were able to watch it all on the screen in their rooms. These were the best of the best Penswi and the game unsurprisingly started at a fast pace.

With those getting eliminated due to underestimating how fast between the first beep and second beep.

'I doubt most vampires would be able to keep up with Penswi like this. I'll be able to use these Elite Penswi to confuse the enemy. On top of that, they would make great thieves. If they were to steal the flasks with the Green Blood it would greatly weaken the other team.' Quinn thought.

While watching the screen at one moment it went into the crowd and showed Ceril sitting beside the Amra that they had met in the arcade. Who knew why the two of them were sitting next to each other, but it did remind Quinn that he wanted to speak to the Amra before leaving the planet.

Continuing to watch the screen though, the first event looked like it was coming to an end, and to no one's surprise, not even Quinn's, it was down to Stark and another Penswi. When looking at Stark he looked familiar.

This was because the person that Russ had changed into on multiple occasions was Stark himself. The muscular body, the longer limbs were all the same. Yet, the face was completely different.

Quinn always thought that if he was to see an alien he would have no clue whether or not he would consider it handsome, but seeing Stark it was quite obvious he was. His face was just so perfect compared to all the other Penswi.

'I guess it's the same here, all the good genes really do go to one person.'

A few seconds later, and the final beep went off, declaring Stark as the winner of the event. The crowd cheered so loud they could feel the vibrations from the room they were in.F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

'Stark was certainly fast, but it didn't look like he reached his top speed in that match. It makes me wonder, just how fast is he? Can I actually beat him?' Quinn wondered.

The second event had started and another person was sent from the Dark Reds, and it was the same result as before with Stark winning again. The Dark Reds were doing well coming in the top 5 of the last two events though, and there were two more to go.

"We need to win the next event if we have any chance of winning this whole thing. It doesn't matter if these guys just win their two matches, it still won't be enough points!" The coach shouted.

"Don't worry." Jun said standing up. "The next one, the obstacle course, let me go out there."

Jun went out to the arena and this one was on a muddy track, along with several rings, climbing frames and more. Three complete laps of the obstacle course needed to be completed before anyone else, and the Penswi were allowed to get a little rough with each other on this one.

But if one was fast enough, they would run ahead of all the other contestants while the others fought. This is what had happened in the past, which would allow Stark to win by a wide margin.

"Hey, Stark!" Jun called out. "You saw our teammates, right? There's a reason why our team decided to add them, they're not just for decoration."

Stark glanced over at Jun while continuing to do a few stretches.

"Hey, I'm serious. I've seen these two, and both of them would definitely be able to beat you, but you see, if I lose in this contest, don't you think it would be boring?" Jun claimed. "Even if you lose to those two aliens, in the end your team will still win. There won't be that excitement.

"So let me propose something, why don't you lose this game, and have a more interesting time against the other two. Think about it, maybe you will have that thrill in you again, thinking that the whole event is on the line in the last couple of games."

Stark didn't reply, which made Jun slightly unsure whether or not Stark would fall for the bait, but all he could do now was wait for the game to start and see what happened.

*BANG

A loud noise went off, and everyone could suddenly see the backside of Stark, who had run right past them once again, with them all trying to catch up. For Jun, he didn't focus on pulling the others down or fighting, but just ran ahead as well.

He continued through the obstacle course going ahead, and Jun was doing quite well. He was in second place for the event, but the problem was he could no longer see Stark.

'Has he already completed three laps, no that can't be the case otherwise an announcement would have been made?' Jun thought.

As he came to the finish line, Jun knew why no announcement had been made, because he could see Stark standing there waiting, yet to cross the finish line.

"Okay, I'll take a bite. Let's see what these aliens have, and see if they can really beat me." Stark said with a smile, as he looked at Jun crossing the finish line.
