The vibrations from the ground had started again and now that they were on the ground, rather than on one of the large pillars, Quinn could feel its effect a lot more. It was a strange feeling, just like the last time, it was hard for him to keep his footing stable. Not only was the ground moving but it felt like the air was as well.

'There is one thing I can try, even though I don't think it's an ability, but it should still be able to block out what is happening around me.' Quinn thought. The shadow body was used, and from head to toe, Quinn was covered in the shadow. As he had assumed, he could no longer feel the vibrations and it was much easier to move.

'To think that I would have to use my powers just because a beast is moving. Just how strong is this god slayer that you have me going up against this time, Mundus?' Quinn raised his hand toward one of the pillars and opened up a shadow portal. In doing so, he stepped through another shadow portal in front of him reaching the top of the pillar giving him a clearer view of what was happening.Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

"The shaking hasn't stopped this time, so I can assume the beast really is moving this time." Quinn said. Looking down, he could also see the demon beasts running away. They no longer seemed to care about each other's territory as they just ran away side by side. It was crazy to think that these were demon tier beasts that were acting like this, and it gave Quinn another clue as well.

Beasts, just like animals, were more sensitive, just like as a vampire Quinn's senses were also more sharp, but due to the vibrations everywhere and in the air, he was having a hard time locating just where the Behemoth would be coming from. Turning around, that's when he could see it in plain sight, and there was no need to search for it.

"I guess there is no need for me to tell you, but that is the opponent you will be facing." Mundus said. "As I said before, I wish you good luck." Mundus had disappeared from Quinn's side, observing the situation and the match from somewhere close by, no doubt.

Meanwhile, Quinn had to take in just what he was seeing. From top to bottom it was a sight that he couldn't even imagine seeing in his dreams. The beast had two large horns like that of a ram. They were black in colour and incredibly thick in size.

The thing was, the beast was so large that the horns of the Behemoth were passing through the clouds. As it moved slowly, its horns seemed to split the clouds apart, and the lightning from the dark clouds was hitting the horns and having no effect. The lightning seemed to be attracted to the horns, as it never struck anywhere else while the Behemoth moved. The Behemoth had a regular face of a beast, something that looked quite similar to a bull, however it had two large overhanging tusks on its face that pointed downward towards its neck and curled slightly.

The entire body looked somewhat like a human, as it stood on its hind legs, walking slowly one step at a time. The beast was black skinned, but throughout its body there were swirling markings, it looked almost like veins on a human but were illuminated in a golden glow.The illuminating power could be seen flickering on the skin all over.

'This is the first time when looking at something, I can understand why they call it a god slayer.' Quinn thought.

If there was one thing Quinn thought he had against this opponent, it looked like it was time. The movements of the beast were incredibly slow, as for where it was trying to move to, who knew. Maybe Quinn had attracted its attention when he was hunting demon tier beasts. There was also the worry like with the phoenix, when he got within a certain range, maybe then it would try to attack.

'Should I try hitting it from far away with the bullets and see how it reacts like I usually would?' Quinn thought. 'No, a better option, while it's moving towards me, is to try and condense my power into the strongest attack I can, and try to kill it in one hit.

'Let's aim for the head.'

He already knew both of his soul weapons would have no effect on a beast like this. The beast was already slow, so slowing it down would do nothing. Even with shadow inside the beast, Quinn doubted he could force it to move to his will. The twin tail chain, although it is strong, wouldn't be able to do much other than scratch its body a few times, so there was no point of tiring himself out with attacks like that.

Quinn raised both of his hands in the air, and a large orb of red aura started to gather. It was condensing while growing in size. The ball of aura was getting larger and larger until it was around the same size as a house.

'Alright, I've condensed as much blood aura as I can into one space, now to add my Qi in and make sure this ball doesn't explode.'

Just like when he combined the two powers in his body, Quinn needed to create a good balance. When creating an attack outside of his body, he needed to make sure the Qi got to mixing with the blood at the right places.

'If I've timed this right, by the time it reaches me, I'll be close enough to hurl this thing, I'll push it forward with my blood control, and the third stage of Qi, right into its head.'

It was safe to say that what Quinn held in his hands was a pure ball of power. It had all of his strength. In a normal fight, he would never have the time to condense so much blood and so much Qi into one attack, but here he was able to.

'Now!' Quinn leapt up into the air, nice and high. He used his strong legs to push him up so he could reach the clouds. Looking in front of him he could see the beast around fifty metres away. If the beast swung its arm, it was likely that it would still be able to reach him. Yet for some reason, there was no reaction from the Behemoth at all, as if it didn't notice Quinn, which, in a way, annoyed him a little.

He hurled the ball and pushed it forward, it moved fast through the air. It was not as fast as the blood bullets but too fast for the Behemoth to react as the large ball covered its entire face and hit it dead on.

The attack exploded on impact with red aura going off in all directions, the black clouds had turned red, and waves of blood aura were seen pulsing out in the sky, and back past Quinn, moving his hair.

'I have to be ready as that might not have been enough to kill it, but it should have done some major damage. If I give it a tiger pulse blow, or something similar I can maybe finish it off.'

As the red aura started to settle, Quinn could see the Behemoth taking a step, and its large face continuing to move closer. When it did, it looked like there wasn't a scratch on the Behemoth. There was no blood, no sign of damage, and the beast continued to walk forward as if it was programmed to do that and nothing else.

'Not even a scratch‚Ä¶ No, that has to be impossible. Is it a shield, some strange energy? No, if it was, I would have sensed something. It is just its skin, is that how tough this thing is‚Ä¶ how am I going to kill this thing?' Quinn thought as he started to worry.
