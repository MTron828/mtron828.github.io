When Quinn had originally made the god slayer ring, he believed it was one of the most powerful items in existence. Because it essentially allowed the user the ability of space. This wasn't even an ability that was known, or that anyone had, at least that he knew of.

Which was why he felt like, as long as it was in the right hands, then there wouldn't be an opponent one couldn't defeat. Of course, these thoughts had occurred when he had first created the ring and was unaware of what was out there in the universe, but nevertheless, it was still a thought he had.

Right now, with the power of space, what Minny had been doing during the fight was space deletion. With the power of the ring, she could delete an area of space. This was how she was able to get rid of the ice ball, as well as the lightning attacks towards her.

It was a great defensive move and could stop practically any attack, being even more effective than the shadow. On top of that, there were other applications to use space deletion, and Minny had utilised them in the fight as well.

One of them was with her attacks. When attacking, she could delete the space between her and her opponent, causing her attack to jump. Which was why H felt like her attack was teleporting.

The deletion of space could only be used on the space itself as well as forms of energy and not on life forms. Which was why she was unable to just delete H out of existence, but there was something she could do.

When moving, she could also delete the space in front of her, and in doing so, just like her attacks, she herself would also jump. Allowing her to somewhat teleport, this was how she was able to pull off the attack and avoid the strike back, but there was one issue.

She was deleting space and not actually teleporting. There was quite a difference between the two.

If Minny was standing directly in front of H, then she couldn't suddenly appear behind him. This was because she could only delete the space between her and H. Whereas if one had a teleporting ability, they could go anywhere they wished.

The ring had more application than that, but with this one simple skill, she was causing trouble for H.

Once again, Minny ran forward from her position, she could see the lightning gathering around H's body. Out of frustration, it looked like he was going to do a large area attack that shocked everywhere.

'This type of attack will still hit me because I can only delete things in front of my right hand.' Minny thought.

The electric went out from H's body in all directions. No matter what was in the square, they were going to get hit. The lightning had touched the very edge and those that were too close watching had been zapped, losing their life in an instant.

The lightning had struck with such a large amount of force that it almost looked like they had been cremated. There was nothing left but ash.

The attack had lit up the whole area for a few seconds. No one could move; otherwise, they would have been dead. Eventually, it stopped. On the field, many expected to see a small burnt body, but there was nothing.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Until a portal of shadow opened, and Minny had popped out of it.

"I have more than just the ring's power. I have the shadow as well."

Immediately, Minny deleted the distance between the two, and she was there again. She attacked the shoulder multiple times. Rather than using the blood swipes, she had the pure aura around her fingertips.

H swung his arm, but she had moved far away again. Then quickly teleporting to the side, she moved several times before quickly moving and attacking the same shoulder again.

Still, despite attacking the shoulder again, her claws were still struggling to make a single mark on H.

"At this rate, she's going to lose!" Jake said from the sidelines. "At the moment, sure, she's fast enough to avoid the attacks from H, but it's not like he's slow. If it was anyone else out there, they would have been hit in seconds.

"She's hitting H multiple times, but her attacks are doing next to nothing. If her attacks can do no harm, then at some point or another, her power is going to run out, and when it does, it's not going to be a pretty sight."

Logan was also observing everything that was going on. They were watching Minny fast in action. It was a game of cat and mouse, and with each attack of H's, everyone had to be careful. The whole city was getting crushed with each single movement of his hand.

The wind pressure alone was sending off blasts that were just as strong as bombs. Nearly all of the buildings had already crumbled in the area, and they were now hiding behind fallen debris.

The area the two of them were fighting was growing and growing, as the debris on the edge of the market square was getting pushed back from the wind of H's attacks.

This continued for a while, and there was eventually not a single building left standing in the area. The city was nothing but large piles and mounds of rubble. The onlookers had to be clever in their use of the rubble to protect themselves from the attacks ahead.

"What is she doing?" Russ clenched his fist angrily. "She's just doing the same thing again and again, expecting the same result."

Many thought this was a desperate struggle, but to one person, it didn't look like that.

"That little girl, I think you should give her more credit," Logan said. "I think she has a bigger plan than any of us realise."

Moving again, Minny could see the shoulder, the same place she had been attacking this entire time. Her clawed hand went out, and when it touched the skin of H, this time, it pierced the damaged scales and went in, creating a small cut across H's shoulder and for the first time, drawing blood.

"Haha, haha, this is the result of your hard effort?" H laughed. "This is nothing!"

"I know!" Minny said, deleting the space and teleporting right to the same cut again. Rather than using her red claw mark, this time she placed her ring on instead.

"But this will do something!"

Minny could not only delete space but also create space as well, and now that there was a small cut in H's arm, it meant there was a small space between the skin, where space could be created.

As the space in between got bigger, so did the cut on H's arm. The space that was created was so sudden and powerful, H's arm had been ripped off from his body and was now lying there on the floor.

Everyone watching, who had seen the little vampire's efforts, had their mouths left hanging open. A being that couldn't even be scratched had just lost an arm, green blood pouring out from the wound.

"This is just the start.." Minny said, huffing and panting.

H was silent for a moment. He didn't say anything, but the bleeding on his arm suddenly stopped. Then the flesh around the wound started to bulge until an arm sprouted right out from the wound. It was another Dalki arm and it looked as good as new.

"Will you look at that, even the small scar you put there has healed." H laughed. "The power of regeneration is a handy one. Now after seeing all your efforts go down the drain, what will you do next?

"And let me tell you, you're right, this is just the-"

Cut off short, a bolt of lightning shot down from the sky. It wasn't a normal bolt of lightning as it was as thick as a house. It spiralled down landing right where H was. The flash was so large and bright, many had to turn to look away.

When the lightning finally faded, they could see a frail man standing on top of H.

"I will get rid of you this time," Sil said.
