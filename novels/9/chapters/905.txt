Chapter 906 - Keep your d.e.s.i.r.e strong

All the others were staring at what was lying on top of Leo’s head. They were looking his way and couldn’t keep their eyes off of it, although Leo couldn’t tell this. There was no reaction from their auras after all, but the reason for them doing such a thing was simple. It was because they were looking at what had decided to lie its fat body on top of Leo’s head.

It had spread its body wide and had its two large paws dangling on top of Leo’s forehead just shy of reaching his eyebrows.

The others seeing this, we’re all thinking along similar lines. ’Cute,’ They thought.

"Hey Leo, you do know what’s on top of your head right now, right?" Nate asked. "I mean, I know you can’t see, but you should still be able to feel it."

Leo’s reaction to the whole thing was what had startled them the most. He didn’t move, he didn’t try to attack the creature, and he acted as if everything was completely normal.

"Of course, I can feel it," Leo replied, which was a relief to the others when he said this. "I know it has been following us for a while, but just like humans, creatures emit a different aura when they are preparing to attack. This little one has been following us for a while now, and it has no intention of harming us. Although I have to admit, I never thought that it would end up protecting us."

Those words reminded them that although the cat looked cute now, yawning and lying on top of Leo’s bald head, it just managed to repel a giant beast with a single paw. Making Silver’s point from before, very valid. That it wasn’t the size of the creatures that mattered.

"Well, it just means this familiar is very special. Do you know what it is?" Nate asked, turning to Silver, the knowledge dropper of the group.

She didn’t mind explaining things. Since her teacher days, she was used to it, and Nate actually was her student at one point. Which was probably why Nate found it natural to ask her questions.

"No, I’m afraid I don’t. But you have to remember, the familiar world is large, just as large as ours. There may be even more familiars than humans, and amongst them, there will be special ones. We have familiars that we know of and have recorded, but I can’t say I have them all to memory, nor do I know which this one is." Silver explained.

At that moment, the cat finally looked like it had finished taking its little rest and hopped down from Leo’s head. Now it was on the floor, on all of its fours. The others could see that the cat was quite fat. It had a large round body, making its head look relatively small, but this just made its appearance even cuter.

"What a fat cat," Fex commented.

Immediately, The cat turned its head and held out its paw. Seeing this and remembering what happened earlier, Fex flinched and held his arms up to protect himself. Closing his eyes, after a few seconds, he felt nothing.

When he looked back at the cat, it was simply just liking its paw, then what appeared to be a grin on the cat’s face appeared.

’No, did that cat just trick me?’

For that to have happened, the familiar must have had a good grasp on the human language and at the same time have a high level of intelligence.

Its next set of movements were strange, the paw it was l.i.c.k.i.n.g until now, it suddenly dug one of its sharp teeth that looked like a fang into it. Blood was now pouring from the paw. It held it upwards and was holding it towards Leo.

"I was right. It looks like the familiar is looking to make a contract." Said Silver. "Although it’s not the conventional way, it seems insistent."

Leo looked at the cat for a few seconds and stared at its two eyes, not looking away. It was as if the two were locked in a battle where neither one of them could blink.

"Leo has won this battle, that’s for sure," Nate whispered to Fex. "How can ’He’ Lose a staring competition?"

Drawing his sword, Leo hovered it an inch above his own finger.

"What is it that you want in return, and how do you know I will be the one to give you what you are looking for?" Leo asked.

The others heard nothing, but in reality, the two of them were speaking to each other, as the cat was able to send its voice directly to Leo so only he could hear.

"You have a d.e.s.i.r.e stronger than I have ever felt before. Even now, you are filled with energy, all for the sake of improving yourself. I never thought I would meet a human that would match my taste. Several drops of blood have entered the familiar world, all of them so dull and straightforward, your’s is interesting. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"As long as your d.e.s.i.r.e stays strong, I and you will not have a problem, and you will be helped out in many ways to come. We, familiars, live a simple life, and we don’t ask for much. Besides, without my help, you all will not survive this place. For helping you, all I ask is to come with you."

Most of what the familiar said, he did not care about, but the last words were what had affected Leo the most.

"What is your name?" Leo asked.

"My name is Ovinnik, just remember to always have your d.e.s.i.r.e, or things could go very wrong."

Having heard enough, Leo moved his blade an inch, making a cut on his thumb. A trickle of blood started to fall, and immediately the familiars in the area started to turn their way.

However, slamming its paw onto the ground, another pulse of energy was sent outward, and the others soon stopped. They ignored them, continuing to go onward to their destination.

Leo and the cat walked closer together until eventually, both wounds had touched each other and finally, they could feel an exchange of energies within each other. A few seconds later, and the cat started to glow brightly until it had disappeared and now, on Leo’s forehead, between his eyebrows just slightly above, he had a black circle appear.

"Although I do not know what or who that familiar is, it certainly seems you have made a strong ally that will help us in the future." Silver said with a smile.

’Where’s my familiar!’ Nate complained and wanted to shout out. ’Give me something cool like that deer from earlier or something.’

Alas, it seemed like nothing was interested in Nate.

"Let’s go," Leo ordered. "It says what we are looking for is in this direction."

The others didn’t argue, they knew that Leo and his new familiar must have been communicating, and the cat seemed to be directing them in the same direction as they were heading in any way, along with all the beasts.

Soon though, the terrain started to change as they left the mushroom forest, and the purple skies had gone dark, turning into a black grey colour. They were now at the base of a large mountain in front of them, and there were no signs of other life anywhere in the area.

Stepping out from the forest, they could see hundreds of different sized familiars all heading over to one place, and now they were part of this group as well.

’You’re telling me, not one of these guys is interested in partnering up with me?’ Nate continued to think about it, but he soon stopped as they could finally see what they were looking for.

Up ahead, all the creatures had stopped and were gathered around something. In what looked similar to a type of throne made from bones, sitting down was none other than the Boneclaw.

All of the familiars were heading to the undead king, to give their respects as he had returned to this area in a long time.
