Chapter Ôªø1891 Unlimited Endurance

Inside the celestial space information was being passed around just as had been requested. News had spread to the celestials and they were keeping an eye on each of the solar systems they were in control of, trying to see if they could spot any of the God Slayers that were on the special list.

Because of this, and due to the time difference in the celestial space compared to the outside world, it didn't take long for them to find the first troublesome God Slayer from earth.

"The ancient ones have made their move against those from Earth‚Ä¶ will they find out what I did?" Yongbu was shaking as he was in the celestial space. Because he was the one that had helped not only BB head back to earth but also had helped Sil, one of the God Slayers that had been targeted.

Since he had heard the news that one of the God Slayers had been found, he was now heading to the direction of the planet where they were discovered. Just like before, a space was to be set up that would allow the celestials to watch the battle in real time.

According to the news, the god Zeko had yet to travel to the planet. He wanted to put on quite a show and was waiting for the other celestials to come and watch.

"Friend, your energy looks nervous, is something wrong?" Xox asked.

"I could say the same to you, shouldn't we be happy that there is a legendary battle taking place." Yongbu replied.

The two didn't realize it, but they were both worried because of the same person.

"I have heard from others that these God Slayers from Earth are strong." Yongbu expressed his worries without revealing his true fears.

"I have heard the same thing, but I would say we have no need to worry," Xox replied. "The gods that have been selected are pure fighters. Zeko is one that has endurance that is out of this world. There was once a similar problem of God Slayers on another race's planet.

"Zeko had been sent to deal with them, and he managed to fight with all of them for ten days straight without rest. Eventually defeating them all, and he still had the energy to continue fighting."

Yongbu started to light up slightly when he heard this about Zeko. There were so many celestials, so many gods that not everyone knew the details of every single one, but Xox of course prided himself on this knowledge.

Anyone who heard this would have confidence, after all the God Slayers were given their name because they had the ability to kill the celestials in the first place. So to hear that this was a veteran, when it came to terms of killing God Slayers, it had settled Yongbu's heart a little.

'Hopefully this whole thing gets sorted, without anyone ever finding anything out.' Yongbu thought.

Eventually the two had reached the area, and a number of celestials had already gathered. Standing in front of the area was Zeko himself, and although they could only see his energy outline with the two serpents coming out from his back, he seemed like a menacing force.

Unlike the other celestials whose energy was bright, his energy seemed cold, bold, and just powerful.

"I will prove myself to all that are here," Zeko said and nothing else, as he went into the bright ball of light for everyone to see.

‚Äî‚Äî

The current situation was as it was, and Ray standing opposite the god could tell this would be a difficult opponent, gathering himself, his body started to change. The spikes came out from his body, a tail grew from his behind and now he was freely able to express himself.

"I don't like the way you're looking at me!" Ray shouted as he ran from where he was and threw out a lightning fast powerful fist. It had been blocked by Zeko, hitting it away, but the force of the punch alone had destroyed the trees that were closest in the background.

Ray punched again, and the attack was blocked once more. Zeko's reflexes were extraordinary and it was the first time that one was even able to block a punch without their whole arm being destroyed.

After blocking a few hits, Zeko threw a couple of fists of his own, but the top of them were slammed down by Ray.

"You think you're the only one that can block?" Ray asked.

At that moment, he could see the two serpents that were on Zeko's back had opened their large mouths and were aiming straight to bite down on Ray's shoulders to hold him in place. Seeing this, Ray opened his own mouth and a breath of fire had appeared.

It wasn't just any fire though, it was mixed with Ray's energy, causing the serpents to flinch for a second, and in that second Ray grabbed both of the serpents by their heads, closing their mouths shut.

He then swung the two serpents over his shoulder lifting the whole of Zeko's body and slamming it into the ground, causing a large crater to appear and cracks to appear around a mile in the distance.G√™tt the latest chùíÇpters on nùíê/velbin(.)com

Ray went to punch the god while he was down once again, but it was hit away. However, Ray didn't care as he unleashed a flurry of punches toward the ground hitting again and again.

The punches were blocked one after another, but that's when Zeko was noticing something.

'The punches‚Ä¶ they're getting faster‚Ä¶'

Ray continued to throw his hands as fast as he could, and his eyes started to narrow as they looked more like that of a dragon. Eventually, Zeko was unable to block a hit while on the ground, and he was hit deeper into the ground. One hit, two hits, three hits, now hit after hit was hitting Zeko.

Eventually, Ray grabbed Zeko's leg and threw him into the air. Soon after, he jumped from the ground chasing after him, and appeared directly above him, as he sprouted wings, and with both fists slammed them right into Zeko sending him back to the ground again.

"Haha, this is great, your body is strong! This is the first time I have hit someone in a while and no holes have appeared in their body!" Ray exclaimed.

Getting up from the ground, Zeko wiped a small bit of blood that had come out from his mouth.

'This God Slayer is tough, but there is no god that has better endurance than me. Soon he will tire, and I will prevail!' Zeko thought as he charged forward, and threw out a fist towards Ray but completely missed, causing Ray to slam his fist right into his face, sending him flying back and across the planet.

‚Äî‚Äî

Inside the celestial space, they had been watching the fight go on, the first day of fighting had passed, then the second, and now it had reached the tenth day. The two of them had been fighting mostly physically with their fists.

Most of the planet had just become miles and miles of craters that had been created from their fight.

However, they all had one thing on their mind, how much more could Zeko's body take?

On the ground was a worn out Zeko, his whole body was covered in purple and black marks, scars that were no longer healing and blood dripping out from every hole in his body.

Ray had delivered another punch from below hitting Zeko right on the chin. He flew up in the air, almost reaching the sky, and his limbs were lifeless as he fell back down through the air and landed right in the spot where he had been hit.

Zeko could no longer move, every breath was painful, while Ray, he had a few scratches on himself here and there, but he wasn't tired at all, despite fighting for 10 days straight.

"You're a monster‚Ä¶" Zeko painfully said.

"Me, the monster? Do I have to remind you that you were the one that came to me, picking a fight." Ray declared as he placed his foot on top of Zeko's head. "You damn gods are all the same. You think you're untouchable, but the truth is you're scared. You're all scared that your position on top will crumble."

Zeko started to laugh.

"You think killing me will do anything? There is a big difference between me and you. Even if you kill me I will be born again! The universe has declared that my life is more important than yours.

"And do you think I am the only one, there are plenty that can replace me, and they will chase after you as long as you are what you are."

Ray let out a big breath for a second, as he focused all his power into his foot. It had been a long time since he had to use anything like Qi, or gather his energy to a certain place, and with a stomp Zeko's head had exploded, killing him on the spot.

"If they are all like you, then I guess I won't have a problem," Ray said. "Are you watching?" Ray turned toward the sky, not knowing if there was anyone watching. "If you are, bring that damned Bliss here, I have a lot of questions to ask her!"

However, there was silence and no response, because even if they were watching they had no clue what to do.

Ray, figuring this out, decided to sit down for a bit. His body felt sore in many places, and he decided to lie down and look at the sky.

After resting for a few minutes soon Ray could see something in the distance. With his great eyesight he could see beyond the sky and into space and noticed something. It was an incredibly large spaceship, larger than anything he had seen before, and on the side there were some words written on it.

"Marpo Cruise? Now that sounds somewhat interesting."
