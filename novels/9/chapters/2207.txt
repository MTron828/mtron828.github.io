Layla had sent out a messge to all of those in the Sil rescue team, as well as Wince who wasn't part of the rescue team but part of the operations because what was going to happen next, she had a big part to play in it as well.

They were now able to freely use their powers. She herself had entered one of the camps that had been set up by the humans and Dalki. There were six Dalki, nearly all of them three spikes, while being surrounded by 20 humans with abilities for support.

A lot of the rubble in the area was lifted into the air, and before the others could react, it was all sent flying right towards the group. The Dalki were able to punch the rocks away, meanwhile the humans were using their powers but some were hit in the chest or knocked in the head pretty badly.

"Who has such power to lift so many things? Do the aliens have powers as well!"

"This is the ability of someone who's at least level 8!"

Another shouted, as he threw an object of his own at the rock that sped towards him and destroyed it into tiny small pieces.

Over the years, Layla hadn't just been developing her powers of unity with the Black Sword, or controlling her Hannya forms. She had also been developing two other things. The power of her Qi and her telekinesis power.

When she was human her telekinesis power was limited to that of a Level 2, but turning into a vampire, that had all changed and she was able to improve her powers greatly. The only thing was, lately there were far more situations where she had to use the power of the Black Sword. Which in turn meant she was unable to use her own power.

Only a few of the human attackers had been taken out by the flying rubble, and practically none of the Dalki, but that was never Layla's intention in the first place. Coming from the right side of one of the humans he saw a glimpse of something moving.

It was an arrow, and it pierced right through the beast armour on his leg, striking him right in the thigh and causing him to fall on the floor. At the same time, others had been hit as well and taken out of the battle.

The Dalki, seeing its humans allies screaming in pain, was looking for the target, and could see Layla standing on a rooftop with a bow and arrow.

"She's over there!" The three Dalki started to run over at a fast speed.

Calmly, with no change in her expression, she placed an arrow in her bow, firing it out, it hit the Dalki in the forearm which was covering its head. Another arrow was fired out, again and again, hitting it in different parts of its body, but the Dalki didn't slow down, instead it sped up.

'Even a three spike Dalki, is this resilient!' Layla seemed annoyed and instead of placing an arrow in her bow. Instead she started to manipulate the red vampire aura in her body. Her horns started to glow bright red, and a condsend blood aura arrow had been made.

Not only that, but powering it with her Qi, she was now taking a trick out of Quinn's book. Letting go, the arrow was let off and started to spin. The Dalki lifted its forearms as it did before.

The arrow flew forward and ripped through the skin, it broke through it with no trouble and caused a big explosion as it went right through the Dalki. There was no head, there were no forearms and the Dalki was dead, falling to the floor.

So much concentration had been put on one of the Dalki, that the other two had now reached her, both of them throwing out their fists. Putting her bow away, she switched to the black sword.

A fast step running forward, she lifted the black sword, slicing diagonally from the bottom. The Dalki's body was split in half, with both halves falling on the rooftop. The other Dalki never expected the sword to strike his ally in one hit, leading his fist to hit nothing but the air.

Immediately though, the last Dalki reacted, as it spun around aiming to throw its fist and kill the female in one hit. A loud bang was heard as the punch connected, but he was unable to move his hand further.

"Did you expect me to go flying?" Layla said, as she held the hand in place with an open palm of her own. "A three spike like you is not strong enough to overpower me!"

Opening her mouth, Layla let out flames right in front of the Dalki's eyes. It was startled for a second, and Layla was already above the Dalki. In her hand she had condensed another arrow of blood aura and Qi, and threw it down right on top of its head. The attack went right through, hitting the ground and destroying the floor beneath them.

Layla levitated herself so only the dead Dalki body fell while placing herself safely on the side of the rooftop.ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

'I need to stop relying on the sword's power, so I can improve as well. No, just like Quinn, I can make use of the sword's power when needed, and become more verstile in my attacks. That way, all around I improve.'

All over the city, camps that had been set up by the Dalki and humans were being wiped out. Russ had infiltrated one disguising himself as a Dalki working with Stark. Ceril was able to use her great blood control and water powers to slice up the Dalki and overpower the humans.

Minny had transformed into her celestial form, ripping through the Dalki's bodies with her sharp claws and speed, and making sure the humans were no longer able to fight.

The ones that were most surprising though, were the group of Blades. They were using all of the powers they had, and going up against humans, they could even take useful ones to use for themselves.

With their improved teamwork, speed and Qi, they were having no trouble getting rid of any opponents that got in their way,. The Alliance was doing better than they thought, and the Dalki were doing worse than they predicted.

Which was why Wince was a little worried. Looking up at the sky, she could see it, the Marpo Cruise ship, was making its move.

Shooting out from the ship, there were six pods. They looked different to the ones before, they were slighty larger and shot out at a faster speed. They swirled around each other, and crystals seemed to be used to create a barrier around them.

Wince could only guess the reason for the enemy to do this was because no matter what, they wanted these pods to land. They had crashed into the ground standing tall, just like the others, and it had landed in the area the Dalki had taken control of.

Coming out of the pods, strong and tall were Dalki, but they were different compared to the others, five of them that had come out, they had five spikes on their backs. So far in the fight it was the highest number of spikes that they had gone against.

However the worst of it, was the last pod that opened. This person had a single l spike sticking out from the top of its head, and then seven spikes running down its back. This one was called Pine.

The first Dalki, that Jack had given powers to.

"Everyone." Wince started to speak thorugh the comunicator, she was unable to see Pine and the other Dalki yet, only the pods before they had crashed. "I think, its time, its time for you all to go and save Sil."

This was the plan, after forcing the two Marpo Cruise ships to split, they would show great strength and back Jack into a corner. Eventually sending some of his strongest down to the war below.

In turn, they would then head to break out Sil, with now less powerful forces on board.

"Everyone you heard what Wince said‚Ä¶ we need to be fast." Layla ordered.

It was true, because if the new forces sent were truly strong, then this wouldn't be something that Wince could handle.
