Quinn lifted up both of his hands, and in doing so, large portals of Shadow had been summoned all across the battlefield. Most of it had become a wasteland full of rubble. 

Nearly all of the buildings in the area had been destroyed, and the fighting was continuing on the hard ground, or on top of the rubble, but the large shadows had caught a lot of the vampires' attention. 

The vampires were still greater in number compared to the beasts and the Amra put together. 

Although the initial surprise had caught them off guard, they were adapting and learning how to deal with the beasts, but they weren't prepared for what was coming next. 

Falling out of the shadow's were gigantic beasts. First they could see a large dangling claw like red arm from one, and then the whole body of a creature that looked like it had come from the dark depths. 

Out of another portal, there was a beast three times larger than an elephant, with ten trunks coming out from its head. As soon as it landed on the ground, it swung the trunks hitting the vampires far away. 

The vampires used their blood aura on the elephant like beast, but were unable to leave a scratch as it continued its rampage. This continued on, as more and more deadly beasts were coming out from the shadow portals, all of them with the same traits, all of them with a lingering shadow that covered their body. 

"We need help!" A vampire screamed. "We can't take them on, it's impossible."

The vampires could feel their immense power and it was only confirmed as they had attempted to fight back. These beasts, they were all at the Demon tier level.

"It's Quinn!" Ronkin said with the biggest smile on his face. From where he was and the angle he was watching the battle from, he was unable to see Quinn, but just seeing the demon tier beasts he knew it was him. 

"He did as he said he would." Jeouk replied. "With the beasts now supporting the Amra, especially at this level, there's no telling who will win this war."

The war was pretty one sided, but demon tier beasts weren't something that just numbers could beat. They were a power too strong for regular vampires to handle. Still, they could see that there were some vampires that were stepping up to the plate. 

Past leaders that had been placed in a slumber, and woken up, the likes of Muka and so on. There were also talented vampire knights as well that were doing well. 

However, that was it, they were just doing well. These beasts seemed to be even more difficult than the regular demon beasts, and that was all due to the environment they had come from, having to live on the planet where the Behemoth existed.

"Quinn… you have become our saviour once again." Geo said, looking at the situation, but he couldn't let him do all the work, and raised his hand. "Fight side by side with the beasts, lets get rid of those that are not welcome on our planet!"

The Amra that were spread out on the battlefield all heard Geo's words, and in response cheered loudly. They were getting a second wind in this fight, and although Geo didn't want to admit it, in some ways he felt like he could rest now, as he could let Quinn deal with the hard ones. 

The original leaders all stood there in place, they were looking at the chaos around them and were wondering what to do. 

"Should we split up?" Wallace, one of the Originals asked. "We have to deal with the demon tier beasts. I don't think the others can handle it. Otherwise all the vampires will be done for and we will lose this war."

Although Wallace had asked a question, the person in charge, who would usually say something hadn't done so, Hikel was dead silent.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"That's not what we should be doing!" Magnus shouted. "We should be going after Quinn. He is the person we have been looking for, and once again, here he is shouting his nonsense!"

It seemed like quite a few of the other leaders agreed with him, but the only thing was, they still remembered from last time, they had attempted to confront Quinn and he had pretty much beaten them all. So how would it be any different this time? 

They needed to wait for Jim to act.

"I'll deal with this!" Magnus said as no one else seemed to be responding, but when he took a step forward, Hikel was standing there in front of him, his hand on Magnus's chest. 

"What are you doing, why are you in my way?" Magnus grunted through his teeth.

Bianca, Edvard, and Grenlet all looked at Hikel. Their expression showing signs of nervousness. 

"Are we really going to do this?" Bianca asked.

"Do what?" Wallace asked, and the other leaders were starting to get weary around the others. 

"You… you heard what he said." Hikel stated. "I wasn't so sure before, but he mentioned himself. He is part of the Punisher's Convent, and as part of that Convent we will do everything in our power to support him!"

The other originals had no clue what Hikel was talking about, but based on the tone of his voice and the uneasy feeling they all felt, they knew something was up, but it was a little too late. 

Magnus could see blood falling down the armour on his chest, and the blood was coming from Hikel's hand. 

"You bastard!!!" Magnus screamed. 

A huge explosion went off, and Magnus was sent flying backwards. At the same time, the other leaders started to act, Grenlet had summoned a blood hammer, and threw out his blood needles trying to apprehend and stop the other originals. 

Meanwhile, Bianca skillfully kicked one of the other leaders in the head. Even Edvard who had been quiet before was acting, as he punched another original in the stomach, before receiving a hit himself. 

"What is going on!" The vampires shouted. 

They could feel the immense power from behind them. It was a power they recognised, so they turned their heads, and in doing so they could see their own leaders, now fighting against each other. 

Just like how the Amra having the beasts on their side had boosted their morale, the vampires seeing their own leaders fighting against each other had lowered theirs. It was confusing for them all.

Edvard was going against Wallace, the 7th leader, who boosted his strongest defence with his cape. He was able to transform and turn it into anything he wished. 

Edvard had been throwing punches but as it hit the cape, his attacks felt like he was hitting nothing but soft air, and soon the cape would change shape. It turned into a spear and was heading right for his head. 

A pain could be felt running through Edvard's body at that point. There were deep injuries inside him, injuries that had yet to heal fully that had been given to him by Jim.

A slip up, in a fight between two originals though, it would be the end for one, that was until a man stood in-between both of them, Quinn holding out his hand, he held onto the spiked cape. 

"Quinn?" Edvard called out… confused as to why this person would help them. 

"I know you probably don't remember me." Quinn said. "Maybe you can just think of this as part of your powers. That fact that you were good to a person like me."

Quinn then raised his hand up, it felt like almost no energy had gathered, but still for some reason, Wallace felt like he needed to do everything in his power to stop this attack.

He covered himself from head to toe in the cape. With his hand raised, Quinn slammed it down, the cape's strange substance did nothing, its ability did nothing as Quinn physically felt Wallace's head with his finger tips, pushing down, until almost a pop sound was heard… the cape fell to the floor, and on the ground where Wallace once stood there was now nothing but blood.

"When this is all over, let's go for a drink together, like we used to." Quinn smiled.
