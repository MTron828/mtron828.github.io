Chapter 2495 Quinn Acts!

The portals were truly appearing all over the universe, and this included where Quinn and the champions had been currently practicing. As the portals opened up, the forces of the Divine Brigade came pouring in. They were high in number, and just in the sky alone, there looked to be around fifty of these things.

"What are those things? Is it one of the demon races? Have they come and found us? But then why wouldn't Immortui come himself?" Quinn said.

The champions tried to get a closer look. They looked like nothing they had seen before in their travels, and the energy that was radiating off their bodies, it didn't feel like Immortui. It was too different.

Even Quinn's energy was quite similar to Immortui's, which was why those like Calva were able to tell that he was a demon and not a natural inhabitant. Although the three champions might not know what every demon race looked like, they knew about all the intelligent inhabitants of the red space, and this wasn't one of them.

The Divine Brigade flew at them like a flock of birds, those dark in colour at the front with their spears pointed toward them, charging up some type of energy, and the golden ones were at the back.

"I don't think they're our friends!" Calva said.

Immediately, like rainfall, the attacks came falling down, and all of them were heading towards the group. As they hit the ground, large explosions of dark power exploded, creating all sorts of small domes over the field.

Each of the champions and Quinn were able to avoid the attacks as they moved out of the way quickly with their speed, and now following up those attacks were the Brigade themselves with their spears held in their hands.

Shinto had lifted up his axe and jumped up, swinging it down through one of the dark beings. It ripped right through its head, splitting it in half and covering it in black flames. The being had quickly died from Shinto's attack, but he soon found himself blasted with a strange shot of energy from one of the golden beings, sending him skidding across the floor.

More attacks came towards him, and he was using his axe to hit them away but was finding it difficult to find another opening.

For Calva, he had two spears held in his hands; he was batting away the spears of the golden beings, hitting them and redirecting their attacks so the bolts would hit each other. There were a lot more of them than him after all.

His attacks would pierce through their chest, some through their head, but even then, as they fell to the floor, the golden beings who were teleporting all over the place would fire at their own allies, and when the attacks hit, their bodies started to heal, and they would get up from the floor again.

"We need to target the golden ones!" Pultra shouted. She swung her legs a few times, and large lines of aura slashed right through a dark being, but her attack continued right through and managed to hit one of the golden beings behind, making it fall to its death.

"If we don't kill the golden ones, they will just keep on healing their little friends!"

The champions were strong and they were showing it as they continued to strike and use their powers to damage those around them, but the golden beings were the ones giving them trouble.

With their fast teleportation, they could only get rid of 1 or 2 once in a while, and with the portals still open behind, it looked like even more were flooding in.

"What is going on right now?" Shinto slammed his axe on the ground, and a line of black flames went across the floor, catching a few of the beings.

Out of all of the powers, Shinto's black flames were the most effective. Even if they were hit by the golden being's energy, it was unable to stop the black flames or heal its allies. DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé

"I'll be honest; I have no idea," Calva said. "Come on Pultra, you're the smart one; if we figure this out, maybe we can get out of this situation."

Pultra continued to fight while observing the situation, and eventually, she had come up with a guess.

"We know Immortui was preparing for something, some type of war against a certain group. That's why he wanted our help," Pultra answered. "If I was to take a guess, based on how these guys are entering the space and aren't an inhabitant or demons themselves, this might be the enemy that he was trying to fight against."

"Hey, I have another question; where's Quinn?" Calva asked.

As soon as the others appeared, Quinn had been avoiding all of the attacks. He had great speed and reflexes to do so, and none of them were able to keep up with him. He could avoid the golden shots and the spear blasts as well as the spears themselves with ease, even though there were so many of them.

He was observing the situation just like Pultra, seeing how portals hadn't just opened up where they were, and even the beings that were attacking them had come at them from several different portals as well.

'If these are the celestials and they see me here, then what will happen? Will they consider the deal we had as void? Will they interfere with what is going on with Earth again?' Quinn thought.

He was hesitant to attack. In a way, if the celestials were now attacking the red space, and Immortui and his demons, then maybe he should just let the two of them hash it out together, and he should try his best to find a way back.

As he focused, though, Quinn was starting to hear things. The cries of pain, the blood that was being split from all over each of the planets. It was something he hadn't felt for a while, not since his fight with Graham when he was evolving into the Celestial vampire.

'What is going on? Are these things killing everyone and everything that they can see? Are they not just after us?'

The three Skullys had quickly been put into his shadow, and although Quinn didn't want to get involved, when he could feel everything that was happening, everything that was going on, was he the type to just stand back?

'No, if I can do something about it, then why don't I?'

The shadow started to cover Quinn's body, and when it went away, the Godslayer armour was now covering his body, having fully recovered.

Stretching out his arms and gripping both of his fists, Quinn activated the power of his gauntlets, and more arms had sprouted out from his back, giving him six in total.

'Let's do this!'

Quinn swung all six of his fists as fast as he could in the air, each time releasing a strong powerful blood aura out of them. It hit the Divine beings right in the face, the legs, and parts of their bodies were disappearing right in front of them.

The golden beings tried to heal them, but they were soon hit again. A fierce storm of red fists was going through the air, from one side to the other, and the entire field was being cleared as the Divine beings were being killed.

"ARGH!" Quinn shouted as he didn't stop.

The armour had the limitless ability, allowing him to not tire, and he kept going at full force. The blooded fists soon surrounded all of the champions that were fighting, and they could see those that they were having a hard time against disappear in front of their eyes as they got hit.

At the same time, not a single one of the champions had been hit by the attacks. When they turned to look at what was happening, they could see that it was Quinn, in some type of armour they hadn't seen before.

"What is this power? Was he holding back when he was fighting against us?" Shinto asked, shocked.

It wasn't just him; so were the others. Calva had witnessed some of Quinn's strength, but what was ingrained in his mind was the demon form, not what he could do out of it.

Eventually, all of those that were attacking them on the ground had been defeated, but a new fleet of them were in the air, flying toward them.

Swinging this, Quinn placed his hand by his side, and bent his knees while sweeping his leg back. Blood aura was gathering around his leg, overflowing as it surrounded his body.

Swinging it out with full force, the entire floor shook beneath them, and out in the air, a giant sword made of blood aura had appeared. It sliced the entire air, looking as if it had cut space itself, and in turn, it had killed all of the Divine Brigade in an instant.

"Yep, he was definitely holding back," Shinto said.
