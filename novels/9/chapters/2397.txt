At the vampire settlement, they had been without their original leaders, Quinn and others, for a while now but it was safe to say that things were running smoothly. With the original leaders having gone into slumber not wanting to deal with the current mess, they had all been replaced with newer leaders.

Thankfully, all the newer leaders at least on the surface seemed to be quite big fans of Quinn and were willing to do whatever would help him best. Even though Muka was running things, they felt like helping her was helping Quinn in a way.

Still, she wasn't on her own, there was also Xander who, once he had regained his memories, was in shock for a little while. He felt guilty for forgetting about Layla and the rest and had actually left the settlement for a while.

He eventually had come back, and in doing so took up a lot of the administrative roles, which he was used to because he did a lot of that work when he was part of the red vampires with Layla in the past.

The days were going by as normal, there were no attacks from familiars or beasts, no takeovers from Immortui trying to cause trouble. The settlement was still relatively on high alert with guards everywhere, but the people felt like they could relax a little, and it also meant that the children could return to school after the little attack they had experienced.

In school, Minny was sitting in her normal seat with the rest of her classmates. Miss Bedford was at the front, the real Miss Bedford this time and was teaching the rest of the class.

There were still guards but they were outside of the classroom rather than inside and these were heavily vetted to make sure there was next to no connection with Immortui. Of course, that might have been somewhat impossible but they tried their best.

The subject of the current lesson was quite an interesting one, as it was a history lesson, it was the subject of Werewolves.

"Werewolves are creatures with a history that dates back even further than ours," Miss Bedford explained. "Unfortunately, Werewolves no longer exist today and that is due to us, the vampires.

"When you are a bit older, we will go into the details of the Great War between us two races, but for now you will learn a few details of why they were considered very dangerous beings that needed to be rid of.

"Firstly, I want you to think back about the duty of a vampire. We were considered as higher beings compared to humans. We lived longer than them, and were naturally more powerful than them. Which is why, we naturally took on our role of protectors.

"But you see, Werewolves viewed humans as mere hunting tools, and on the night of the full moon, they were unable to control themselves, killing whatever they could get their hands on, human or vampires. Which was why in the end the vampires stepped up their natural duty, and felt like it was their need to get rid of them."

The lesson continued on not explaining much about Werewolves but did show images of what they looked like to the class, as well as some paintings of Werewolves and vampires fighting which excited the students.

When it was break time, the students were so excited that they started to play a game of Werewolves against vampires, where the vampires would have to capture the werewolves. It was similar to a human game called cops and robbers, only the vampires were the police and the Werewolves were the criminals.

Watching all of this, Minny had a strange thought in her head.

'Miss Bedford said that the Werewolves were extinct‚Ä¶but isn't Uncle Chris a Werewolf, and he is a nice person as well,' Minny thought.

Minny didn't ask Miss Bedford in class nor did she ask any of the other teachers because she knew that they wouldn't tell her the truth. She knew that there were things that were hidden from them, that her father and mother told her to never speak about, so they were unlikely to know much.

When she had a question like this on her mind, there was one person that was best for her to go to. When the day ended, Minny had headed home with her mother, and she quickly asked the question if she was free to go to a certain place, her mother of course didn't mind and that was how she had ended up in a lab.I think you should take a look at

"Hello, Uncle Vincent!" Minny said as she jumped up on the lab table careful not to knock over any of the experimental items or equipment that were there.

Vincent stopped what he was working on, and immediately went to a special fridge he had in his room, opening up there was a cold juice pack. He quickly threw it over to Minny who caught the box and started drinking straight away. It brought a smile to his face, he knew he was spoiling her but he didn't care.

"Minny, how many times do I have to tell you," Vincent said. "Although I look young, I am your many great grandfather, you can just call me Grandad, no need to call me uncle."

"Okay, Grandad!" Minny said already having finished her juice box. "Grandad, I wanted to ask, are all Werewolves bad?"

It was a sudden and strange question Vincent thought, and he had to think about it before he gave an answer.

"Of course not," Vincent said. "Just like vampires, there can be good and bad werewolves. Although during my time, there were a lot of fights between us and them."

"Then, why aren't there a lot of Werewolves today, what happened?" Minny asked.

"I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the vampires were scared of them. You see, there was something special about their attacks. When hurt or bit by them, they stopped our natural healing process, and if we were bit by them, then our blood aura would fade away as well.

"But, I'm sure, I read somewhere that there was a time period where Werewolves and Vampires had even got on for a while. So it makes me wonder‚Ä¶"

As Vincent explained, he was alive during the time Werewolves existed, but wasn't there during the war between the two races. He had escaped from the Settlement at the time, and had bigger things to worry about.

Then when he gave up being a vampire, putting all of his powers in the book, he really gave up on knowing about the supernatural world altogether. However, somewhere between then, and when he woke up again, the war that wiped out the werewolves must have happened.

Now even Vincent was curious about the answer, and he felt like there might be someone who knew. Logan had received all of the information from Richard Eno. Before, Vincent thought that Richard had gone into a deep slumber but later they had found out he had faked it and continued to live, watching everything, so he was bound to have some records of what had really happened between the vampires and Werewolves to turn their relationship so sour.
