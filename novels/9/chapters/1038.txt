Chapter 1039 - The final deal

Quinn knew that it was important to keep what Erin was a secret, due to it being one of the ’Kill on sight subclasses.’ Similar to the blood fairy. However, Quinn thought it made sense since their blood was deadly, and even he and his group were able to benefit from the use of the fairy blood.

As for Erin being a Dhampir, there hadn’t been any stand out signs why they were treated in a similar way.

"Say whatever you want, but no matter what, I’m not getting rid of Erin." Quinn said. "She has done nothing wrong."

"I understand that, but you should at least know the time bomb that you are holding onto." Eno replied. "You being a human turned vampire, you will probably understand this more from your perspective. The urge a vampire gets when they smell human blood for the first time. The first time a vampire gets a taste for the blood.

"It’s something so powerful that one loses their mind, not knowing what they have done."

Quinn remembered this well, because in the process, he had taken the blood of one of his now closest friends, Layla.

"Now as you said, the Dhampir are a superior race, they don’t need blood, and they can live in the sunlight without having to use rings like us, but they don’t come without their own faults either.

"I’m sure you’ve noticed your subclasses evolving in certain ways, and it’s the same for a Dhampir. Only, they grow through killing vampires not their blood, but from killing. The l.u.s.t they feel is the same as a vampire’s for blood, but there is a big difference. Vampires don’t need to kill humans to satisfy their l.u.s.t and hunger. So tell me, how would you be able to satisfy her needs?

"If she’s already killed a few, then slowly over time that l.u.s.t will grow stronger, just like a vampire l.u.s.t for human blood grows over time as they starve for blood."

Now it made sense, why the vampires were afraid of them. According to Eno, their l.u.s.t was only satisfied by killing vampires. It was like a bloodsucker but one who hunted vampires instead.

"But Erin’s never shown any signs of anything like that!" Quinn argued back. "And, if there are vampires that can control their l.u.s.t for blood, then I’m sure that Erin can do the same."

"You make a good point." Eno replied. "Perhaps there is a way for ’One’ to control their l.u.s.t, but eventually there will be those that can’t, and from the looks of it, your vampire knight has already noticed a few things."

Turning to Leo, Quinn was wondering what he was on about. Leo looked as calm as he did before, but that’s when Quinn noticed it wasn’t his facial expression that changed. It was his heart beat.

Knowing the cat was out of the bag, Leo spoke.

"Erin is learning Quinn." Leo said. "She is learning to control it, and I have promised her if anything happens that is against her own wishes, that I will be the one to stop her. I will make sure she doesn’t hurt any of her friends."

Hearing this was not what Quinn was expecting. Even more so, he didn’t expect Leo to hide something like this from him. Was it when Erin had done battle in the vampire world? Now that she had killed a vampire, was that l.u.s.t growing by the day? It was now another problem that he had to deal with, and this time, he didn’t have to worry about the humans of the group.

"She will learn to control it Quinn, just as you said, trust her." Leo reassured him.

"I wouldn’t see this as a bad thing, if it was me, why not make her stronger? Make her evolve and control her powers just like you did Quinn, and soon you will have someone fit to be by your side equal in strength, or maybe even surpassing the strength of any vampire ever seen."

’Train her?’ Quinn thought. How would that even be possible? If she had to kill vampires to evolve? It wasn’t like Quinn, who could level up through killing beasts. Thinking about this was annoying him more and he just wanted to move on from the subject.

"Enough!" Quinn shouted. "Now it’s time for us to do the questioning. Tell me, why did the Dalki attack Planet Caladi, and why didn’t you let me call for help?"

"You haven’t guessed that by now?" Eno replied. "I have a network and I have been feeding the information to the Dalki for a while now. There’s a reason why they weren’t so quick to attack earth after the first war.

"They assumed that the beast was secretly on plant Caladi thanks to me, at the same time I knew that you would be there Quinn. Remember, I created the system with Vincent and the Green family, I knew what it was meant to do. Vincent probably had no idea that I knew who he was at the time, but I knew everything and I chose to help him.

"Through the system, By completing quests it would gradually give you Vincent’s vampire strength from the book and increase your own as you learnt yourself what being a vampire meant. I wanted to put you in a dire situation so you could grow and improve but you impressed me Quinn.

"I underestimated your strength. Either you are a talented boy because of the Eno bloodline that runs through your veins, or the system has somehow become more powerful than I ever predicted." Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This was something that Vincent had guessed as well. The system was growing. There were some things that had been set up by the three creators but when Vincent gave his powers to the book along with the system, they were unaware that his soul would be bound to the system. Vincent had a theory that perhaps his own ability was being used by the system which was how it was surpassing everyone’s expectations. Rewarding Quinn, like it had its own ability of equivalent exchanges.

Quinn didn’t like the answer Eno had given, but it was one he had expected at least. He had already told him how he didn’t care for the individual lives of humans.

"Jim, is he the one that created the Dalki, is he still alive and helping them?" Quinn asked.

"I’m suppressed you learnt of that name. It looks like you have been doing your own research together. Yes, in fact I assume that Jim was also the one behind the Green family’s death. I don’t quite understand his emotions behind helping the Dalki, but I have been in search of him since. At the moment, he is untouchable." Eno replied.

"What do you mean?" Quinn asked.

"Haven’t I been saying this the whole time, the Dalki are a dangerous threat, why do you think I keep repeating this fact. Because the simple truth is, if the Dalki right now were to attack the human race you would lose the fight.

"You must know what Dalki blood does to vampires, so it isn’t the same for the vampires but even they are blind to their growing strength and their desperate measures. However, if Arthur has joined their side for whatever reason, perhaps it is my own doing, then it means the vampires will definitely lose."

"About Sil, you said that you could make two bodies for him, what were you planning to do and how were you planning to do it?" Quinn asked.

"I created the clones using part of my power. There’s indeed a way to create human clones at the moment, but there is a catch that I was only going to reveal until later. If I was to create a normal human clone, at most with my abilities subsidising the cloning process, they could live for two years."

When Eno said this, Logan was expecting Quinn to be more angry, didn’t this mean they actually couldn’t bring Raten and Vorden back. At least not permanently. Yet for some reason Quinn was calm.

’It looks like we are going to have to go with my third plan anyway.’ Quinn thought.

"Are there any more questions, what about you Logan? I can talk about the days I knew some of your relatives, although I didn’t know your parents well so I guess it would be useless, and as for why Jim killed your parents you would have to ask him that question yourself." Said Eno.

"I do have a question." Logan said. "In the vampire world, we know of Jim’s lab but we also found another lab. One where there was a test, a trial almost. One where after completing each quest there would be a special red pill given to each of the participants. The teleporter that you made found on earth sent us to that Lab. I know it’s yours and not Jim’s. What was that used for?"

Logan had been curious about them ever since, in truth he had found a way to recreate the red pills, but there was a reason he didn’t want to distribute them to all those in the Cursed. Something just felt strange about them.

"Ah yes, the blood pills. You see I was testing a certain effect with them, a way to make humans stronger by mixing in parts of vampire cells. The pills worked of course but there was a large problem with them.

"If a vampire was to take the pill, it would have no such effect, but if a human was to take one, it would permanently increase a certain attribute. What I found out later was these pills borrowed from the future. For each pill taken, it would drastically shorten the lifespan of a person. My goal is to make it so humans could survive.

"If a pill like that got out, there would be a war between each other as they overdosed attempting to kill each other."

Finally there was quiet in the room. Quinn had gotten the answers he was looking for, but there were still a couple things that he hadn’t learnt about. Eno didn’t really know why Arthur was against the vampires, and the strength of the Dalki. There was also what Eno meant when he was referring to his people that he had working for him everywhere, were they more clones? But these were things they could find out with time, as long as the relationship between them grew.

’Are the humans and vampires underestimating the Dlaki, or is Eno overestimating them, and can Arthur be convinced not to kill the vampires. If these things are true, then I still need to get stronger, and quickly. I still need Eno.’ Quinn thought.

"I’m going to call in that favour you owe me. For answering everything, you can stay on the ship, but no more trouble Eno. I mean it. You really want to help the humans, and so do I. In theory, we have the same goal. You think I’m not strong enough to go against the Dalki. Then make me strong enough. Teach me how to use my blood skills.

"And we will have the best chance against the Dalki race. Do we have a deal?" Quinn asked.
