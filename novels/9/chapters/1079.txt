Chapter 1080 - The old vs the New

On planet earth, the new school base that had been built was redesigned to serve its purpose as the central hub for the main military. This was always the plan once the students were to leave, so it was easy work converting the rooms as they saw fit.

Here, Oscar was currently in some type of command room. Several computer servers were running, and each worker was monitoring something on their screen. All the information from the different beast planets, the Cursed faction, and the Graylash faction would come back to here.

"I need a report on how Owen is doing out there!" Oscar demanded. It was rare for those to see him the way he was currently, a little agitated and shouty. Usually, Oscar was always calm, but his frustrations were led by the fact that Owen was out there on his own.

"Sir, we can’t get in contact with Head leader Owen. From what we can see, he has already engaged in combat personally with the Dalki!" One of the men shouted from their seats.

Holding onto an oversized chair that was in front of him, Oscar gripped onto it so tight that the plastic on the chair was starting to crack.

’Owen, I know you’re strong, but before in the past, it took all of us to take down a four spike Dalki. You never experienced what we did back then. Do you really think your life is worth it? You should retreat!’ Oscar thought.

Knowing that Owen was facing a four spiked Dalki, Oscar was debating whether or not to go out there himself. They had a low chance of winning the battle otherwise. However, he didn’t understand why the Dalki were attacking with such a strong force this early on, and what significance that planet held. It was the only thing that was keeping him back.

He needed to stay on earth in case anything else happened here.

’Owen, I hope the god of luck is on your side.’

The Dalki closest to him attempted to grab him, but before they could get close, he was lifted into the air with a constant flow of the lightning. Once he stopped, the Dalki fell to the ground and didn’t get back up. The others now had him surrounded. Using his fan, he threw it up in the air and struck it with lighting once again.

For a few seconds, the metal fan stayed floating in the air, and soon it rained thunder like a tent covering Owen’s body and hitting all the Dalki around.

’I need to deal with them as fast as I can and get to that four spiked Dalki!’ Owen thought as he stepped forward and leapt up with his two feet spinning his body. With lighting shooting off from his feet and covering his body, he was able to make himself become a giant lightning bolt, hitting three of the Dalki along the way. Finally, when he landed, he was standing in front of the Dalki leader. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This one looked different from the others. His skin was greener in colour instead of blackened scales like the other Daki, and running up his back, it was clear as day. Four spikes were sticking out. However, there were no other Dalki around him. Instead, they ignored him and chose to go straight for the people behind him.

"Do I really look that weak!’ Owen shouted. He was currently on one knee and was huffing and panting. He had used far more of his MC points than he had wished to get up to this point. The forces consisted of plenty of two spiked Dalki that were resilient. At first, Owen was testing how much power was needed to kill them.

When not killing them in a single strike, he only made them stronger and was surprised by how resilient they were.

"You are already tired, and you haven’t even fought against me yet. You are just a single human, but I have to admit you seem to be the only one that has caused me some trouble." Dalki said.

’Although this is the person with lightning abilities, is this the man that hurt One Horn? Which means I should be careful.’ Green Horn thought. ’Wait, that can’t be right. He said that was an old man. This doesn’t look like an old man to me. The Humans are getting weaker after all.’

"You know nothing, do you!" As he pushed himself up, Owen smiled and opened up his fan to cover his face as usual. His breathing now seemed to be under control.

"You know, I was hailed a genius even among the Graylash family members. I was able to progress faster and teach techniques to my people to help them grow." Owen said. "Our lighting abilities seem to be different compared to the other powers out there. For us, it’s all about the breath."

Soon something started to glow in front of Owen, as his soul weapon was starting to activate.

Back in the command room, Oscar was still waiting for something to happen, and suddenly, a beeping coming from one of the corners of the room could be heard. It quickly went onto the main screen as an energy source was being felt. It was the strongest signal they had seen had landed on a specific place on earth.

"Sir, an urgent report!" A man said. "It appears that a Dalki has entered the city of Zoo. They have invaded earth!"

"How is that possible? We have been keeping track outside. There have been no sh.i.p.s and no pods!" Oscar shouted.

It was true. Even from all the footage they had, they could see nothing from space. Until one of the cameras caught something. It looked like the Dalki had just fallen out of the sky. There was no pod, nothing, as they fell straight to the ground, but a few seconds before landing, they did see something, wings.

"This reading, it looks like it’s another four spiked Dalki! It seems to be the only one as well." They reported.

’What is going on? In the first war, we only faced one four spiked Dalki, and now there are two! And what is their goal of landing in Zoo of all places? There is no one there that can handle a four spiked Dalki. Mona Bree is still missing!’

"We need to move out as quickly as possible and head to Zoo immediately!" Oscar ordered.

Inside the coliseum, the dust had settled entirely, and the head of the emperor tier humanoid beast was chucked to the side by the Dalki. As it hit the wall, it splattered into pieces, only leaving black blood on the wall.

The human who controlled the beast had long run out of the arena, but instead, another one had jumped in. The red-haired man, with his two weapons drawn.

Leo too, had his weapon drawn, and even Ovin was on high alert as its eyes started to glow, forming the trail of yellow mist. Every single one of them was looking towards the Dalki in the centre.

They didn’t need to communicate. They didn’t need to say anything. They just knew that they would need to work together to take this Dalki down.

’Should I contact Quinn and inform him of what is happening here?’ Leo thought. ’If the Dalki is here, perhaps the teleporters aren’t working either. However, how would he get here? He can summon me to his side, but what about Erin, and there are no shadow users here either.’

"Who would have thought the two of us would be working together," Chris spoke. "You know, when I first met you, I thought that maybe we could be friends, talk about a few things together, looks like that might have to wait. I can feel your bloodl.u.s.t and the bloodl.u.s.t coming from your sword there as well.

"You hate these giant lizard’s don’t you? Well, a good thing for you. I hate them too!" Chris said, as he activated all the Qi that he had contained in his body, there was no use hiding it now.

Unlike Leo’s, which was calm and controlled, Chris’s was wild, and his body was reinforced with it everywhere. It was the largest amount of Qi Leo had ever seen.

Cutting his sword through the air, Leo smiled.

’Since when did I start becoming reliant on the boy. I will solve this matter with my own hands, and I shall get revenge for everyone.’
