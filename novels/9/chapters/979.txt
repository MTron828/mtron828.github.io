Chapter 980 - A tricky opponent

On Fex’s execution day, Kazz had seen the power of the Boneclaw, back then, it was able to go toe to toe with her father, until eventually its energy was running low. She knew the Boneclaw was an incredibly strong familiar that not many vampires would be able to handle.

However, Quinn was someone who had even bested her father in a fight. Yet, for some reason, the Boneclaw had attempted to challenge Quinn now. When he was possibly at his strongest.

’Something had to have changed in the Boneclaw’s reasoning, is Quinn’s d.e.s.i.r.e from before no longer matching up with its, or did something happen to the Boneclaw to make it feel this way?’

Finding out the answer to the question wouldn’t help the situation. What she needed to do right now was decide if she was going to help Quinn or not.

’Is the Boneclaw underestimating me?’ Quinn thought. ’It has been a while since we separated from each other and I assure you I have gotten stronger. Or perhaps it considers me weaker than its last master?’

[Shadow equip]

Not wanting to underestimate the fight, Quinn made sure to put all pieces of beast gear on his body, and that included the red oni type mask on his face. Making the first move, Quinn cast a shadow path along the floor, heading straight towards the Boneclaw.

’If I slow it down, then I can actually hit it dead on, and for the first time ever, I don’t have to worry about killing you!’ Quinn thought. As long as there was still a connection between Quinn and his familiar, it meant that if the familiar was to die, it simply wouldn’t be able to be summoned for a while.

The shadow path was one of the slower skills of Quinn’s, and seeing the attack coming towards the Boneclaw, it simply entered one of its black portals as it opened and disappeared before the shadow could hit it.

A strong claw came out towards Quinn’s right side, but the shadow was able to move from his back to stop the attack. However, Quinn was unaware that somehow the Boneclaw was now attacking from his right side as well. He had no choice but to lift his arm to block the attack head on.

The claw scr.a.p.ed and hit his gauntlets.

’Damn, that attack is strong, I can feel the whole blow through my body!’ Quinn thought. He knew he couldn’t rely on just his vampire strength to push it back, and started to concentrate and form his second stage qi towards his forearm area, and eventually pushed the claw back.

When Quinn regained his composure he could see the Boneclaw was once again, far away.

’The system wasn’t lying when they said he’s gotten stronger. His teleportation speed and strength, I’m sure, are packing more power and faster than before. If he keeps teleporting everywhere, how am I meant to get him? None of my blood skills will work.’

Kazz who was standing at the side was watching it all carefully, she wanted to step in as she had made the decision herself to help Quinn. But she saw what the Boneclaw had done. While teleporting its body to Quinn’s right side and attacking it with one of its arms, it had opened another portal on Quinn’s left side, and simply stuck its arm through another black portal it had created.

So the Boneclaw was able to attack two locations on Quinn’s body at once. What was even more frightening was, as soon as Kazz took a step forward, another black portal had opened up in front of her, and a large dangling claw had appeared, grazing her arm, now throbbing with pain.

Trying to trap the Boneclaw, Quinn decided to open up a shadow dome, covering both of them. Whenever he needed to fight a person one on one, Quinn would use this skill and similar to the Boneclaw, he could equally go wherever he wished in the shadow using shadow hop, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.

Thinking he had trapped the Boneclaw, Quinn was getting ready to plan his next attack, but before he could. The Boneclaw created another portal, and now he was nowhere to be seen.

’It looks like he can also teleport outside of your dome.’ Vincent said.

It looked like he was right as well, as his Shadow Mc points were going down by the second.

[MC 1200/1260]

[MC 1170/1260]

[MC 1140/1260]

Each hit from the Boneclaw was taking off thirty MC points, and it was rapidly going down as he had the dome up.

Closing the dome quickly, Quinn could see the Boneclaw just outside where the edge of it would be.

"Screw you!" Quinn said, opening his hand showing the palms and then closing it in a fist, the next second the Boneclaw had completely disappeared.

’You know that won’t stop him for long.’ Vincent said.

’I know, but I just need time to think. I can’t hit him with any of my blood skills, otherwise he will just teleport everywhere, so to be able to hit him I have to slow him down.’

It certainly was a strange fight for Quinn, although he didn’t feel like he couldn’t beat the opponent in front of him, it was the most trickiest fight he ever had, and just as Vincent said, it looked like the Shadow lock didn’t hold the Boneclaw at all, as he seemingly appeared out of nowhere.

’So you can teleport out of that as well?’

Quinn thought that perhaps the Boneclaw would start to attack the shadow space, but there was no need for that.

Still, trying to come up with something that could hit or slow the Boneclaw down, it looked like it was time for the Boneclaw to attack instead. It didn’t move from its spot and was still roughly ten meters away from where Quinn’s position was.

Moving its large arms, each time a black portal would appear in front of it, and at the same time, another one directly in front of Quinn’s face. He whacked it away out of instinct, seeing the long dangling finger.

"He can attack from that far away?!’ But the attacks weren’t over, as the Boneclaw kept striking the air around him and the attacks would appear in all sorts of different places around Quinn, from behind, from above, and below.

’Damn it, Alex worked hard on these.’

Now watching Quinn block the attacks desperately, Kazz began to realise something. Quinn’s combat skills for a vampire leader were quite poor. He had strong blood skills, but they were powered with a strange power and simple. Perhaps one of his biggest advantages in fights was due to people not fully knowing what the shadow could do.

However, here, where his shadow and blood skills didn’t work well against an opponent, one would be better off trying to use their hand to hand combat, but the Bone claw, who just did fast simple attacks was able to overwhelm him.

Through the barrage of attack, Quinn could see the Bone claw was unmoving, apart from its arms, and he saw this as an opportunity. He moved his shadow to block the majority of the attacks, leaving only a small hole, and through that hole a single finger could fit through.

[Blood bullet]

Firing off, a blood attack infused with Qi through the small hole made in the shadow, he could see it becoming a success. The blood bullet was the fastest attacking Skill Quinn had.

If he couldn’t slow it down, then this would just have to do. The bullet went right through its shoulder, and a cloud of black smoke started to appear where the wound was meant to be.

’Did that really do nothing?’ Quinn thought.

He came to realise that this time, Quinn wasn’t fighting against a beast, or a vampire, where Qi infused attacks would do damage or the beast would feel pain. This was a different enemy altogether.

The next second, the Boneclaw disappeared and a large scratch was made towards his back, going through Quinn’s armour and reaching his skin, tearing it easily.

His shadow was too preoccupied with the attacks at the front, and he hadn’t moved it behind him in time.

’Is Quinn really going to lose? Someone who defeated my father, and Cindy with the absolute blood skill, to a familiar?’ Kazz worriedly thought.

Just what was this familiar that was able to cause so much trouble for Quinn.

"I really didn’t want to do this, and I didn’t think I would have to use it again so soon. After all the work I did to get the shadow and now I have to use it against you." Quinn said, as he placed his hand on the ground, and all of the shadow sank spreading out. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
