When the researchers were given the task to come to the planet that was meant to have next to no life on it, they thought it was an easy task. The Dalki, as well as the Travellers that were quite high up in terms of ability level and beast gear, were there just in case they ran into any trouble.

Maybe a few that were still alive that could cause some trouble. Never had they expected for this to happen. The attack used by the frail man was so powerful and had made such a devastating noise that it had broken their eardrums.

They could hardly hear anything, apart from a dull ring, and as that faded, everything was muddled. Blood was dripping down the side of their heads, and even their brains felt like they were somewhat in pain.

Huddled over, they were grabbing their head and ears, rolling back and forth. Usually, beast gear or Qi would give one enough energy to protect themselves from the sound of an attack like this, but they had none of that, which was why they had been so affected by the attack.

The mud around Stark's feet was starting to harden slightly. He was no longer sinking into the ground, but it would still be hard for him to get out on his own. Still, he stood there stunned once again, staring at this person.

'So this is Sil‚Ä¶ this is the person that everyone has been waiting for. What is this power?' Stark thought.

In less than a second, Sil had taken out four Dalki just like that. The attack was so fast that even Stark felt like there was a chance that he wouldn't be able to escape it.

'I understand now why they said this person was our hope. Even without him using the machine, with his power alone he has enough strength to turn the tide of this war and save us.'

Sil had opened up his special soul weapon book and selected a few abilities. After that, he walked over to where Stark was and placed his hand on the ground. The mud substance underneath his feet started to move, and Stark was shot right up. When he landed, the ground was hardened again and was back to normal.

The things he was seeing, the powers he was using, it was amazing for Stark even now. He had heard what Sil could do from the others, but seeing one person use a variety of abilities, and each one so skillfully, was still an amazing thing for him to see.

"We need to make sure these researchers don't talk," Sil said, placing his hands on the ground again.

Soon, a whirlpool of mud appeared underneath all of their bodies. They were getting swept in until their whole bodies sunk underground, and only their heads could be seen. After that, the mud around them started to harden.

Sil could easily kill them, but he felt that doing so would leave a bad taste in his mouth. After all, they didn't truly know what they were doing.

"To answer your question from before, I know Quinn. I know him very well, in fact, enough to know that what you are wearing right now used to belong to him," Sil answered.

This rise of energy started to overcome Stark. He didn't know what overcame him, but he fell to his knees right there and then. Without realising it, he had built all of this tension in his head, and after seeing his powers, he was waiting for those words.

"There is a lot‚Ä¶ a lot I need to tell you," Stark said.

Stark started with Quinn's story, what had happened to him. How everyone forgot his memories. After all, Sil had been trapped, and in doing so was unaware of what happened after he disappeared.

After that, he went on to explain the war that was taking place right now, and how they had managed to save him. He even included details about how the Blades were currently there, and who was on their side fighting for them on another planet.

"Those bastards, they kept toying with me!" Sil gathered Qi in his body, which helped him bring strength in his fist since his natural muscles had been vastly depleted.

Sil remembered some things very well after he was brought in by H. He knew that Jack was behind everything because there were a few times where they had met in that special room.

During the fight with H, Jack was curious about Sil's powers, and after trapping him, and draining him of his energy until he was not a threat anymore, he brought in those with powers that could be used against him, powers that would often be useless in battle.

One, a rare ability that worked similar to that of the vampire influence skill, but since it was an ability, it was far more effective. It had conditions, such as only working a few times on one person, but with it, Jack had managed to get the fact of how Sil was able to use so many powers, and it was due to his Soul Weapon, the book.

This information, however, had actually caused Jack to fear Sil somewhat. Who knew how many abilities he had? With his power, there was a chance that he could maybe reverse the memory change ability.

Even if he didn't, if he was let free, with his future sight, he would be able to see things that didn't make sense, or maybe even rewind time to the point where the ability didn't work on him.

Jack had considered Sil too dangerous to be used in a way he was using powers, which was why he was locked up the way he had been. It also scared Jack to the point where he didn't wish to take Sil's power, too worried that maybe his power would be taken as well.

After all, would Sil still have a Soul Weapon? If that was the case, then how would it work? Either way, it wasn't something Jack wanted to test.

However, through his weakened state, other ability users could force Sil to do their bidding. To control his mind in other ways whenever they needed to use him, and Sil remembered everything he did.

"I need to pay them all back." Sil gritted his teeth. "I will get all of them, including H for causing all of this!"

"Then we should hurry quickly, who knows what is happening to the others, I have a ship not too far away!" Stark stated.

Thinking about everything though, Sil once again opened his book up, changing his abilities once more.

"Before that, there is still something that I need to test. We need to see if it works and how to use it."

Stark was unsure what Sil was talking about and just watched him as he walked up to the researchers. One of them had the mud ability anyway, so Sil was sure once they had recovered enough they would be able to break out from this place anyway.

Using their ability was just to keep them here for a bit because he had another use for them. Sil gently placed his hand on top of one of the researchers' heads.

"I've been forced to use the power a few times, but I was in a lot of pain from using it through that machine, but I think I got it," Sil said as he lifted his hand.

"You said to me before, that everyone forgot who Quinn Talen was right?" Sil asked.

"Yeah!" Stark replied back.

"Alright, so tell me, do you know Quinn Talen?" Sil asked.

Both of them looked at the researcher for a while waiting for him to answer, but there was no answer.

"Ah right, I almost forgot." Sil knelt down and placed both of his hands next to the researchers' ears. They started to glow, and his ears started to heal.

"Sorry about that, now let me ask you again, do you know Quinn Talen?" Sil asked.

The researcher looked dazed, confused, and mostly scared.

"Please don't hurt me‚Ä¶ please!" the researcher stated.

"Then answer the question!" Sil said, his hands lit up with lightning.

"Yes! Yes! Of course, I know Quinn Talen!"
