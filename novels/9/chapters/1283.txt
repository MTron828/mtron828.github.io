Chapter 1284 - A New Tier

His appearance had changed once again through evolution, but Borden was unsure whether Vorden was now inhabiting the body of a humanoid beast who had evolved into a Demi-god tier beast or whether the crystals they had gathered had been enough to allow Tails to reach the Demon tier level.

Borden looked over at the two struggling Dalki to get an idea just how powerful Vorden had grown. The Dalki that was now covered in green blood, was standing up and the other that had been blasted through the wall was also returning. Thankfully it seemed like the one Borden had thrown through the floor wasn't getting back up, which hopefully meant that it was dead.

"Ah, I guess I'm still not strong enough to take out a three spiked Dalki in one hit, these guys are super tough." Vorden stated calmly, his wings on his back started to move slightly, getting ready to be used. Jumping back, it looked like Vorden's body was floating for a few seconds as he landed gently by Borden's side.

"Even as a Demi-god tier beast it won't be easy for me to match up against this trio of three spikes. Borden, I'm going to need your help on this one." Vorden requested. Fortunately, their opponents were on the weaker end among three spikes, so as long as Borden teamed up with his brother, the two of them felt confident in taking them. .

"What about Raten?" Borden asked. "Is he still going through the evolution process?"

With the two Dalki getting closer, Vorden was getting ready to attack, opting to answer Borden's question later, but it was at that moment that a smile appeared on his face, as he realised there would be no need for him to do anything.

"Just see for yourself."

The two Dalki were a little shocked by the sudden entrance of a beast. However, on their way towards the castle, they had run into many beasts that had attacked them, so they assumed this one would be no different.

Nevertheless, they remained cautious because this was the first beast that had managed to draw blood on their hard scaled bodies, because of this all of their attention was focused on the Dalki and beast in front of them, that they had failed to notice that both of them could no longer move.

When they attempted to move their feet, they suddenly felt stuck. Looking down, both of them could see that their feet had been encased in some type of mud.

"What is this?! Why can't we move?!" One of them shouted in anger, but with no momentum and just their power alone they were unable to break through the substance that had appeared below them. This was a first for the two Dalki who used their strength to break through everything.

'Just how strong is that stuff if it can stop even three spiked Dalki from moving and where did it come from?' Borden wondered, as he hadn't been paying much attention either. The next second, a human figure could be seen dropping from above, and at the same time, two large blades were being formed in seconds.

A liquid mud-like substance could be seen changing shape and forming into the two blades at the last second, until it had pierced right through the top of both the Dalki's heads, like two meat skewers, both of them were no longer moving.

Now standing, in the middle of the two Dalki, was the mud-like beast.

"Raten, you killed them so easily! But how is that possible‚Ä¶ unless you're a‚Ä¶" Borden wasn't too sure about the evolution, since Muddy's appearance hadn't changed as drastically as Tails.

"Hahaha‚Ä¶hahaha‚Ä¶this is GREAT!" Raten loud enough that he risked attracting any nearby Dalki, and that was because he didn't care about this possibility. In fact, he was so confident in this new body that he would welcome any to come over to him.

"Yeah, your guess is right." Vorden replied. "Muddy managed to evolve, which means right now Raten is controlling the body of a humanoid Demon tier beast. I was worried that even after hunting that many high tier beasts we would lack in crystals, but fortunately Muddy had done a good job on his own." G√™tt the latest chùíÇpters on nùíê/velbin(.)com

"We were also lucky that Tails' body needed far less crystal than we had estimated. Since it seemed impossible for me to evolve into a Demon tier, I handed my remaining share over to Raten." Vorden started to explain.

"After we finished our evolution, we noticed that there were Dalki in the castle. The first one actually entered our room and Raten dealt with it before I could even help. We then split up, he eliminated other Dalki we could hear, and I came to you, since I was worried."

"According to Muddy, even though his form hasn't changed too much, he now can use a number of different skills he couldn't do before. His body can form into a type of soft mud, but when it's hardened it's just as strong as the weapons or shield he made before. He can even change his whole body into a mud like substance, even his real form and can practically transform into whatever shape he wants right now."

"If he wanted to go under doors as just a pile of mud he can, whereas before he could only transform part of his mud and was limited to his human-like appearance."

Although it didn't sound too impressive, Borden, who had been fighting the three spiked Dalki, had just seen it in action. The Mud Hardening was able to even restrain their strength, making it extremely useful.

It was then, that the mud surrounding the Dalkis' legs had joined up with Ratan's body that Borden could see a slight change, the sheer size of Raten was now bulkier, but he soon disperse the mud making small little daggers by his side, and started to mold the mud more and more, putting detail into every little indent in his body, until finally something had happened that not even Vorden had seen coming.

Both of them were completely shocked by the change.

"Y-you now look completely like a‚Ä¶H-human." Vorden stuttered, still in disbelief and honestly a little jealous.

Before, Raten with the beast body just had a human-like figure, but one could still see that it was just a beast. Now there was so much detail in his appearance. Were it not for the strange colour, as well as some missing parts of the human body like lips, Raten could be mistaken for a human. He had even molded himself a pair of eyebrows.

After finishing looking at Raten in awe, the three of them knew they needed to do something. They were sure that things must have gone horribly wrong on the outside if the Dalki had managed to infiltrate the castle. They were still lacking the whole picture due to staying inside the whole time.

Borden was quite hurt, and Vorden had offered him an injection, but taking one meant that his body would fully heal, and he would lose access to all the strength his injured body granted him.

"I think it might be best if we save that for later. I can still fight, and we don't know who else is inside this castle." Borden rejected his offer.

Before leaving the place, the three Blades decided to scout the whole area to see if there was anyone else inside. It was then that they had found their first vampires that tried to attack them, but dealing with the vampires was a lot easier than the Dalki.

Going up through the floors they were encountering more, and eventually they had stumbled upon a whole group of masked men who used the red aura powers of the vampire, while another had used an earth ability.

Vorden found this strange as it was the first ability user they had come across. Vorden wanted to test a few things out, for he didn't seem to have super strength or speed like the others either, but Raten had killed the masked man before they could ask him anything.

'Dalki, Vampires and now even Humans, all of them are working together to take over this island? Just who is our enemy to be able to gather these three different groups under one banner?' Vorden wondered.

After clearing out the castle, not finding out much in regards to why those people had come here, they decided to head outside, where they could hear the fighting taking place all over.

"We should go to Sam and see if he needs our help with anything?" Vorden suggested.

"Sure, but do you happen to have ANY idea where Sam currently is?" Raten replied sarcastically since none of them had a way to contact the vampire.

In the middle of their small argument, they could feel the ground underneath them shake, followed by a loud roaring not too far from them.

"This has to be the Demon tier beast." Borden pointed out. "But why does it sound so‚Ä¶angry?"

Both Raten and Vorden looked at each other. Although both of them were inside the body of a humanoid beast, to them it had just sounded like a beast's roar, so they were wondering how Borden could tell how it was feeling.

However, Vorden considered that Borden wasn't quite like them. He wasn't just half beast, but created using one half of the Demon tier beast that was on this island, so perhaps he shared some connection to it, at least enough to be able to pick up on its emotions.

"If it's angry, maybe we should go see why." Vorden suggested.
