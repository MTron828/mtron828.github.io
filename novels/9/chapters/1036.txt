Chapter 1037 - Trapped between two

"I have to ask." Eno said. "How did you know I would be here?"

With a blade pointed an inch away from Eno’s neck. He seemed pretty calm and it didn’t look like he was fazed at all. Judging by his aura, Leo could tell this as well.

"Was that a question?" Leo asked. "I thought you only answered questions if you got something in return. You seem to be quite the composed person but unfortunately for you, I can see more than others ever could with their eyes. For a brief moment, perhaps you didn’t react but your aura did when you saw Erin’s hair colour change.

"It is my duty to look after those in the Cursed family."

"You have the right attitude to be a vampire knight. If you were a real vampire everyone would be fighting to have you as their knight." Eno said. "It looks like Quinn has found a good one, but my question wasn’t directed towards you."

At that moment, shadows started to disperse and another person was seen present in the room, and that was Quinn. He had been in the room from the very beginning and was ready to jump in to save Erin at any moment, but what had surprised him was Leo being there as well.

"Coming from someone who made those comments about Borden, I don’t see why you wouldn’t feel a similar way about Erin either. Besides, for someone who had put me through a pretty cruel test, do you think I would trust you on the ship so easily?" Quinn said.

It was at that moment that Eno realised that Quinn wasn’t as naive as he thought. He had given him an illusion that he was free to do as he wished while continuing to follow him.

"Congratulations, but what will you be doing to me now then, seeing as I attempted to kill one of your precious members? Don’t you still need me?" Eno said.

At this point, Quinn was sure that Eno was trying to get him to act out for some reason, and even Eno was wondering why Quinn was so calm even though one of his friends had nearly just been killed.

He looked over at Erin who appeared to be sleeping away, even through all of their talking. She was either quite the deep sleeper, or exhausted.

"What’s the point of getting angry at you?" Quinn said. "After all, you’re not the real Eno, right?"

Eno’s eyes widened.

’How did he know? I’m sure he couldn’t tell the difference before. How was he able to catch on so quickly?’ Eno thought.

Even Leo wasn’t sure how Quinn knew. The aura that Leo was sensing now, and the one from before were identical to the one he had met earlier today. Unless even from back then, it had been the fake Eno as well.

The truth was, Quinn didn’t know. The person who had informed him, was Vincent. He was the real person who was able to tell which one was the real Eno and which one was the fake. It was all based on the action he had seen partake with Sil.

Vincent couldn’t quite explain it, but what was clear was, the clones didn’t have the same ability as Eno. Even if they were vampires, and could use blood skills they didn’t have the equivalent exchange ability and this was what tipped Vincent off.

"Well then, I guess it won’t be a problem if my blade were to pierce through his neck." Leo said casually.

Hearing Leo say these words, were even frightening Quinn a little. He had never seen him so aggressive, but lately Quinn hadn’t even had a chance to catch up with Leo. At the moment, he seemed to be on edge far more than usual.

"Let’s see you try!" Eno suddenly said, stepping forward having encased blood around the tip of the blade. Even with Leo pushing his sword forward a stream of blood hardened around it and it was unable to do anything.

The next second, Eno lifted his hand, and controlling the blood around the blade he lifted the sword up and away from him. However, a few seconds later, and using the second stage of Qi, Leo was able to surround his blade and take the blood off to attempt to attack again. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

"Interesting, no wonder you are so interested in Pure, you share the same power as them!" Eno said, soon covering both of his fists in spirals of blood.

When Leo went to attack again, the spiral flattened out like a shield blocking the attack, and even with Qi disrupting the flow of blood, the shield would constantly regenerate itself holding the sword in place as it spun around.

With his other hand free, Eno attempted to attack, but soon felt a kick to the back of his leg, causing him to fall to one knee.

"You getting involved in our fight, I thought you were just going to stand there and watch." Eno said, looking at Quinn behind him.

"Leo, don’t kill him. Capture the clone and I’m sure we can learn a lot about him." Quinn said.

He didn’t know how strong this clone of Eno’s was. Perhaps it had equal power to Eno, or a little less, but with the two of them, he was sure they could capture Eno quite successfully.

While down on the ground. Eno attempted to spin around and kick the back of Quinn’s leg. But Quinn naturally lifted it up, and when he put his foot down he stomped on Eno’s leg. A strike from Leo’s sword came from above, and Eno combined both spirals of blood surrounding his hand, to block the attack once again.

Then, after stopping the sword in place, the blood started to move upward, branching off like tree branches and was heading straight for Leo. Quinn was trying to hurry and pushed his shadow over to help Leo, hoping it would get there in time, but it wasn’t needed.

As a strange invisible force, soon pushed all of the tree branches of blood back to where it was. Seeing this opportunity, Quinn stomped the back of Eno’s legs two more times, and then pulled both of Eno’s arms back.

At that moment, abandoning his sword to be held by the blood, Leo rushed to the side and grabbed Eno’s head. A strange sudden burst of energy was felt, and soon Eno’s eyes were closed as his body went limp.

"What was that?" Quinn asked. "Did you kill him?"

"That, I guess I haven’t had time to tell you, but I think I have managed to perfect the third stage of Qi." Leo answered. "Don’t worry he is not dead, but why did you want to capture him?"

Quinn suspected that capturing the real Eno would never be as easy, but in truth he actually wanted one of Enos clones. "Let’s take him to Logan and have him do a little check up, we just need to find what exactly this, or he, is."

’I would be a little careful Quinn. Remember, the real Eno is still out there, and we don’t yet know what these other Eno’s are capable of.’ Vincent warned. ’They might have some way that they are able to communicate and pass on information to each other. Or perhaps they each have a mind of their own, similar to Borden.’

——

It wasn’t that Logan was prepared for restraining Eno if something was to happen. The way he explained it, was that he just happened to have been working all day today, on special restraints that would be able to hold a vampire leader.

It was based off the black material from the vampire world, and glathrium. They were similar to a pair of cuffs but far thicker and gave no space for movement of one’s hands or legs at all. Making so one couldn’t build up power to break them.

At the moment, a blood sample was being taken and all sorts of body checks were being done on the Eno clone. Hoping to find out if it really was a clone, or something else, and maybe they could help Sil without his help.

Quinn never planned to resort to anything like this, but after what Eno had done he felt like he had every right to do what he was doing at the moment.

The spider that Logan had continued to monitor what they believed was to be the real Eno, who was currently wide awake himself.

’Should I let things just play out as they are going now? So far they are doing expectantly well.’ Eno thought. ’Perhaps they deserve a few rewards.’
