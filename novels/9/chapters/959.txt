Chapter 960 - No ability, take mine

Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After the incident with the pen, there were less disturbances and Quinn was allowed to go through and explain everything that was needed. He hated to admit it, but sometimes force, or a show of strength, was one of the best deterrents. At least it was for the way things were now.

Quinn went through the process of how school life would be for them, and the different classes they could attend. Explaining the benefits of each one and answering any questions the students had. Soon after, the students were to select what classes they would like to attend and if their request was accepted, then their schedule that was linked to their watch would automatically update.

After everyone had selected their classes based on the information Quinn had given, the sound for the morning class had gone off, and students were now free to head to their next lesson.

"Before you all leave, can I speak to Shiro please for a little bit." Quinn asked, and the other students soon left.

However, as they walked past their desk there were two students who had stopped to look at Quinn and they had stars in their eyes.

"Mr. Hardy!" Swin called out. "That thing you did with the pen was amazing. Can we do something like that as well if we attend your class?"

"Don’t be stupid Swin, that was obviously an ability." Venus argued. "So do you mind telling us what your ability is? You hid it on the first day because you didn’t want to show off right."

Quinn honestly didn’t know how to deal with this. The two kids were leaning over his desk and couldn’t stop staring at him expecting some grand answer. The truth was, even if they attended his beast weapons class, those kids probably couldn’t do something like that.

He could do so just because of his strange vampiric strength.

"If you want to learn something like that, you will have to put in a lot of hard work." Quinn said with a serious face and his arms crossed, trying to give an impression of a teacher.

"That’s amazing!" Venus replied as the two of them started to head towards the exit. "We’ll see you at the beast weapons class then." They called out and waved goodbye.

’I guess inspiring some of them might be easier than I thought.’ Quinn said, quite happy based on the reaction of the two students.

Once all the students had left though, Shiro was left behind. Shiro was a boy who had brown hair that stuck upwards with three large spikes, but from Quinn’s first impression he didn’t seem like a trouble maker.

While in class, he didn’t speak to anyone and he seemed to be diligently taking notes, but there was a reason why Quinn had called him off. Sitting down so the two of them were more comfortable, Quinn decided to throw the question out there.

"There’s no need to be worried, you’re not in trouble or anything." Quinn said, noticing Shiro’s nervousness over having been asked to stay behind. "I was just a little curious. It’s actually rarer to have someone like you in the class than it is to have an original. I was wondering, didn’t the military offer you the standard earth book? Your file says you have no ability."

Shiro, was the one student in Quinn’s class that had no ability, just like himself back then.

"I rejected their offer." Shiro replied politely.

"You don’t have to tell me, but may I ask why?" Quinn asked. There was silence for a few seconds, so Quinn decided to push it a bit further. "The reason I’m asking is because I was the same as you. Throughout my whole school life I didn’t have an ability, and it was only midway through the military that I gained mine." Quinn led but it was almost the truth.

It seemed like Quinn’s little push had worked, since Shiro had answered.

"I need a better ability than that if I want to get somewhere." Said Shiro. "Not to offend you in the Cursed faction, but I was hoping I could prove my way somehow so I could get the ability of the Graylash family."

Now it made sense why he would reject the ability, but at this age, it was almost impossible to prove one’s worth without having an ability in the first place. Without connections or showing promise there would be no way for the Graylash family to recruit him.

If he had an ability, at least he could join one of the factions belonging to the Graylash family, and as a reward they might award his next of Kin with the ability. However, sadly it was unlikely that Shiro would ever get such an ability.

"I think I know the answer, but may I ask why?" Quinn said.

"Because, I need to become strong, and their ability is the strongest out there." Shiro replied.

Speaking to the boy, and seeing the determination in his eyes. It reminded Quinn a lot like himself at his age.

"Alright, you’re free to go, but before you do I just want to tell you something. Maybe there are other abilities out there that are stronger than the Graylash ability, so if you can’t get that far. Don’t give up." Quinn said.

From initial impressions, the boy was a good candidate to attempt to teach the Shadow ability to. However, Quinn wasn’t just going to teach him because he could. Quinn wanted someone who wished to join the Cursed group.

Right now, Shiro wasn’t that person, but it didn’t mean he would never be.

At the moment, Quinn had no lessons, and he was struggling with what to do with his spare time. So he decided to meditate and focus on increasing his Qi. Soon though, time started to pass by quickly and the bell went off once again, signalling it was time for lunch.

The food was provided by that of the school, but Quinn couldn’t eat the food anyway. The only reason why he was actually heading to the canteen was to meet up with the others as they had agreed.

The teachers and students canteen were separated, so Quinn wouldn’t be able to see how Sil was doing. But based on his class, all he had seen Sil do during Homeroom class was place his head on the desk and stay in the same position.

When entering the canteen, Quinn could see that Fex, Peter and Helen were sitting together, so he decided to go ahead and join them on the round table.

"Don’t tell me you’re not eating as well." Helen said, as she saw Quinn sitting down with no tray of food. "Are all the boys on a diet these days? It’s going to make me feel shy if I’m the only one eating." She said.

Each of the boys didn’t really know how to answer that, and Quinn tried to change the topic straight away.

"So, how has your first lesson been?" Quinn asked.

"The kids have been great with me, although they asked far too many questions about the faction." Helen replied, as she carefully ate her food making sure none of it would spill as to embarrass herself.

’I guess even she has her cute side.’ Quinn thought.

"I didn’t teach any lessons yet." Peter replied. "I think they said I was just going to be an assistant anyway, which means I will just stand at the back unless someone needs me."

In a way, the others thought it was a good thing that Peter wasn’t the lead teacher. They hadn’t been keeping an eye on him when he taught the Blade kids, but just assumed he had been doing well since none of them complained. However, after witnessing his performance from earlier, they were a little frightened as to what he would do.

"I had my class." Fex said. "And it was actually quite interesting. It seems like a lot of girls had signed up, and well they just kept asking me to personally teach them so many things." Fex said, as he pushed his hair back and had a cheeky smile on his face.

"Oh I see, so you’re taking advantage of these young girls just because you’re quite the looker." Said Helen.

At this moment, Fex’s face had gone bright red. He thought he was being quite sly, but he wasn’t. Everyone knew he was bragging in his own way, but just didn’t call him out on it, while Helen did.

"Hey, you have to remember, they’re actually nearly the same age as me, and I’m not doing anything." Fex replied.

"Well, if you didn’t think you were doing anything wrong you wouldn’t have gotten so defensive just now, would you?" Helen replied again, and Fex had nothing to reply back to that.

After that, the group continued to talk and there was a relatively nice atmosphere between them all. For once, Quinn imagined his life as it was currently. Maybe being a teacher wasn’t so bad of a choice for him.

If there was no war going on, if there were no abilities and he had a better school life, perhaps this would have been a career choice for him.

Quinn had one more registration to do with his homeroom class and soon after, he would teach his beast weapons class in the afternoon. Upon returning to his classroom, he could see his students were there waiting.

But some of the students were gathered around a few others, and when Quinn had entered they quickly left.

"What happened!" Quinn asked.

As he could see, several of his students were beaten and bruised, including the likes of Shiro, Venus and Swin.

"Oh this, don’t worry too much about it, teach." Swin said, holding his eye, and speaking through his busted up lip. "Just kids being kids. We just got into an argument with one of the other classes, but don’t worry about it."

Seeing them like this, had brought a wave of emotions and memories crashing down for Quinn.

"Tell me, who did this to you now." Quinn said, unable to control his anger and without realising it, his eyes were glowing red as he gave this command.
