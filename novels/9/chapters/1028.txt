Chapter 1029 - The most important figures in the world

Despite what Quinn‚Äôs note had said, the group decided that it might be best if they tried waiting for him for at least a little while. They headed to the location that they had been instructed to go to and up ahead they could see what could only be described as a grand mansion.

It was only a short way from the new school that had been built but was also out of sight, covered by a few of the main buildings. It made people who worked at the school wonder if it had always been there or if it had been built just for today‚Äôs event.

Regardless, it had a grand finish. The mansion had two huge spiralling staircases that would lead up to the balcony on the second floor, which was large enough to fit a few hundred people. On the ground floor at the entrance there were pillars laced in a special glowing silver substance and even had the most beautiful of beast crystals wrapped around it.

The dozens of people walking past them were wearing much more glamorous clothing than any of the Cursed group, so much so that some of them started to get cold feet as they felt they didn‚Äôt belong there.

Leading up to the mansion was a stone walkway and a wide red carpet had been laid out for the attendees. The arriving guests walked in on the red carpet while hundreds of camera and video drones were flying through the air, snapping the event.

The Cursed members knew that no one cared about them coming to this event, it was all about Quinn. They also knew if the Cursed faction turned up without him, there would be questions.

"What a waste of beast crystals." Peter said, looking disgusted at the ostentatious pillars.

"You have a point, we risk our lives fighting beasts so we can create better weapons, not so they can be used as decorations." Wevil added, looking at an obviously rich couple walk past. The woman had a timeless black dress on and on her ears she donned earrings with a beast crystal on each.

In a way, the rarer the beast crystal someone had showed how much power a certain family had. Powerful beast crystals would go for a lot of money mainly so they could be turned into weapons, but if someone could purchase them and use them as a fashion accessory, it would show the world how little an expensive beast crystal meant to them.

"I don‚Äôt think we can wait much longer. Most people have arrived and if none of us enter, then it might be a problem." Sam suggested and reluctantly they all followed him walking along the red carpet.

While doing so, some of the other guests who were also walking started to stare at them. They could see they were trying to guess who they were, if it was anyone they recognized. However no matter how hard they tried, they couldn‚Äôt figure it out.

"It must be some of the teachers that worked at the school or a captain of a squad." One of them whispered to another.

"They could be from the Cursed faction, not many people know what they look like." Another replied.

While making their way along the red carpet, they did spot two people they did recognise, Bonny and Void, the two reporters that they had met when facing the demon tier beast.

When Sam and the others walked through, Bonny recognised them immediately and gave them a smile, before placing a microphone in front of Sam.

"Now we have approaching the door, finally some high ranking members from the Cursed faction. Please could you introduce yourselves to those watching at home and also tell us your role within the Cursed faction." Bonny asked in her best interview voice.

For the first time ever, while Sam stared into the lens of the camera, he froze. It was half because it was unexpected and half because the Cursed faction didn‚Äôt really give out roles, everyone kind of just did what they wanted. On top of that, there were a lot of ears listening in.

"The leaders of the Cursed faction... where‚Äôs the leader? I don‚Äôt see the person named Quinn?"

"He is meant to be here today right?"

"Of course, Owen and Oscar are at this event too. This is meant to be a gathering of the Earth‚Äôs strongest powers. The Cursed being one of the new powers should have arrived before everyone else to make an impression."

Listening to all these comments was making Sam stumble even more. That‚Äôs when Linda decided to step in.

"This here is our trusted Vice leader of the Cursed faction. If Quinn isn‚Äôt present then we follow what he tells us to do. Then we have Peter, who is not only the Head General, but is in charge of our defences on the Cursed ship.

"Wevil and I work together in communications with the other factions. We work closely with Helen from the past Daisy faction who you might have already met before us. We try to make it so if any of the other factions have a problem they can talk to us. Finally, Nate is in charge of our hand to hand combat division. As you can see, we have brought quite a few of our high ranking members here because we understand how important this event is." Linda answered proficiently.

The others were quite surprised that Linda was able to give them all roles so easily, but now that they thought about it, she really did just describe what a lot of them did for the Cursed faction. Although Peter‚Äôs position was a bit of a stretch, at one point he did protect the ship alone from several attacks.

"That‚Äôs great to hear. A lot of people don‚Äôt know about the Cursed faction since they managed to grow so quickly, but Oscar has said that they helped greatly during the demon tier hunting expedition, and Owen has always spoken great things about your leader, Quinn Talen. I have to ask, will we be seeing him tonight? He hasn‚Äôt made an appearance yet."

Finally, Sam was ready to speak.

"He said he will be here so he will definitely be here. If there is one thing the Cursed faction is good at, it‚Äôs doing what they say they will do. He just has important matters to attend to." Sam said, while walking off and the others soon followed him.

With seemingly everyone having entered the large hall they could now rest for a little while. The announcement would be made later on and it was time for everyone to mingle and get to know each other, although it was harder for some. Owen stood next to Oscar and there were many that were afraid to even get close to the two of them as they talked.

Meanwhile others were talking while looking their way. Bonny and Voiid continued to go around interviewing others, asking them questions about what accomplishments they had done and more.

When together the group were standing awkwardly to the side of the room. They clearly felt like the odd ones out as everyone seemed to know each other.

As for Nate, he was looking at a certain person in particular. He was looking over in Helen‚Äôs direction.

"Hey, you know that she likes Quinn, right? I don‚Äôt want you to cause drama." Sam said as he spotted Nate staring at her.

"No, I‚Äôm not looking at her, she brought her two sisters along to this event as well. Is it alright if I go over?" Nate asked. R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at n√¥(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

After that, there was meant to be an after party where there were no cameras.

"I think it‚Äôs fine, but just be careful. Bonny and Void might come to interview you at any point and you need to be careful if you answer their questions. Everyone is out to ruin our reputation at the moment. Let‚Äôs meet back in an hour." Sam suggested, but Nate was already off before Sam had finished speaking.

Peter was fine doing nothing, just leaning up against a pillar looking at everyone. Wevil and Linda were enjoying each other‚Äôs company. They talked to each other a lot these days, while Sam had plucked up the courage to try and make a few connections.

It was important after all, unless the Cursed faction were planning to take over the world which wasn‚Äôt Quinn‚Äôs intention. Sam thought it would be nice to talk to the people they would be working with for the foreseeable future.

At the same time, he would keep an eye out for when Quinn arrived, and when Eno did as well.

This left Fex on his own, who had managed to spot Samantha trying to grab some appetizers from the waiter‚Äôs walking around, but there were people standing in her way.

A large man, who wasn‚Äôt paying her any attention had blocked a special seafood dish she was just dying to try. Then suddenly, it started to float in the air, before it landed in her hand.

"Was that what you were trying to get?" Fex asked with a warm smile.

When Samantha turned to see who it was, she was quite startled.

‚ÄôI knew I might run into him here, but I didn‚Äôt expect him to come up to me like that.‚Äô She thought, as she started to panic.

"Oh thanks, that‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for." She replied, and was now trying to make a quick exit from the awkward situation, but she could feel Fex‚Äôs eyes not moving from her.

There was a reason Fex had approached her and when the two made eye contact his eyes started to glow red.

"Do you remember what I asked, I said to make sure you didn‚Äôt tell anyone about what I did back against the Dalki. Now tell me, did you keep our little secret?" Fex asked.

"Now it‚Äôs not very nice to speak to a lady like that, is it?" A voice said from behind Samantha.

Seeing the man‚Äôs red eyes reflect back at Fex, he straight away knew who this was.

"Richard Eno..." Fex replied back.
