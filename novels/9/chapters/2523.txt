Chapter 2524 ¬†Final Chance

A small flash inside a cave had appeared, and a blonde-haired figure held a curly dark-haired man in his arms. He softly placed him on the floor, and as he looked upon his face, tears couldn't stop from rolling down.

"Quinn... Quinn, you can't be, it's impossible, you've never done this before, answer me!" Sil shouted as he shook the shoulder of his friend, but his eyes kept lingering down.

As they did, he looked upon the large hole in his chest. Even now touching him, Sil could tell he felt very cold, and he couldn't even sense a flicker of a heartbeat.

"You can't die before us! You can't!" Sil shouted. "You can't die when you were the one that saved all of our lives! We came here to help you, not to bury you, so get the F*ck up, get up! Get up, get up!" Sil continued to shout at the top of his lungs.

After getting Quinn from in the middle of Unzoku and Immortui, he had returned to the cave. At the time, he wasn't able to get a proper look at Quinn, but seeing him on the ground, he feared the worst, and now seeing him like this, it appeared as if the worst had occurred.

"You attacked Unzoku when there was no need to." another voice said, bouncing off the cave walls.

Sil wasn't alone in the cave, for Mundus had discovered him and had remained inside, watching the events. In truth, he had a plan; he just didn't realize how ridiculous his plan was. He was to snatch away the red crystal from Immortui if Quinn was to fail. FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

from the fight was too much for Mundus to handle.

He was a little slow in acting; he didn't know why, himself. On reflection, perhaps he had put too much hope in Quinn winning the match. When he tried to intervene, the power that was emitting from the fight was too much for Mundus to handle.

Then when the fight was over, Immortui hardly looked damaged at all, and he felt like Unzoku was even stronger than before. It was impossible to stop them, so he stayed here, but Sil had decided to act.

"He was going after Quinn, I had to stop him!" Sil shouted back.

"But Quinn is dead, and you are alive!" Mundus replied. "I already explained to you. I restored your MC cells back to what they were, but that was a one-time thing. The colourless ability is still inside you; I can't remove it.

"Soon my power will weaken, and the colourless ability will continue to spread. It won't kill you, but whatever powers or energy you use from now on will never be restored again."

"You just attacked Unzoku, and wasted your power for no reason!"

In the condition that Sil was in when Mundus found him, he wouldn't have been surprised if he ended up dead in a couple of hours, but Mundus was able to pause the ability to keep it on hold.

On top of that, he had placed his celestial powers over Sil's heart. This was to shield it from the colourless ability, keeping him alive. Then, using his powers to speed up time while using his powers to stop time, he stopped the effect of the colourless ability while allowing Sil's body to recover.

He had regained his MC cells. However, when Mundus' ability had stopped, the colourless ability continued to spread through Sil. He could use the MC cells that he had restored, but after that, he would never be able to use his powers again.

At that moment, Sil wasn't thinking of the explanation Mundus had given. He just wanted to stop Unzoku at all costs.

The sound of sobbing continued, and they were left there in silence, while he looked out at the scene that was taking place. The portal was opening, and the large fleet ships were breaking through.

'I have failed my task.'

While looking out the opening of the cave, blocking his view, he could see several human-shaped figures start to enter the cave. They had done so quite rapidly, one after the other.

"You?" Russ said, immediately noticing Mundus, but the sound of heavy footsteps soon stopped all of that.

With each step, the ground shook, as it was violently filled with Qi. He walked past everyone, and they all took a step away as they looked at Peter.

"Quinn." Peter said, walking forward. He could see Sil sobbing as he held him and shuffled to the side, allowing Peter to have a better look.

"It's a lie, right?" Peter asked, taking another step, stronger than the last, his power erupting, causing a few pieces of rubble to fall from above.

"QUINN!" Peter shouted with such strength. "Get up, get up!" Peter shouted and went down to the floor, falling to his knees. "Please... please.." Peter repeated these words and moved his hands slowly.

He went and grabbed Quinn's hand, lifting it, and started to rub it back and forth. "Come on, man.. don't do this to me, please.. you're like the only thing I have left, please." Peter said.

It was a heartbreaking thing for them all. The wight that was known for showing no emotion was, for some reason, showing an extreme amount of emotion.

Peter's head sunk into his chest, and he closed his eyes tight. "F*ck, F*ck, F*ck!" He squealed out. "How... Am I meant to go back to Layla without you?"

Eventually, Peter's shoulders started to move up and down, and red tears were streaming down his face. His body was in a state of uncontrollable motions that his celestial energy had transformed him, and he was crying out tears of energy.

Everyone, at that moment, even Russ, had stood up. They then walked to the side of the caves and in silence looked at the body of Quinn. A well of emotions was filling them all up.

They were remembering everything that had happened, everything that took place that made it so they were here, why they had decided to come and join and help Quinn out on his journey.

As they thought about all of this, emotions were changing by the second. Could they have done more? Angry at themselves for relying too much on Quinn, for putting too much on his shoulders.

Edvard lifted the flask with the Demon King's blood in it and moved forward. The champions had done the same with their flasks as well.

"We completed the mission, but it looks like we were too late in doing so," Edvard said as he poured it into Quinn's mouth.

Soon after, Pultra had done the same with her flask. There was a bit of hope in all of them that maybe the demon blood might have done something, but there was no reaction at all.

"If we had gotten here in time... and gave him the blood, would he have beaten Immortui?" Calva said out loud what the others were thinking.

They all knew a large-scale battle had to have been taking place; they could feel the energy, so they guessed that this was all his doing.

"Quinn has asked us to do so for a reason," Chris said, as he looked at his hand. "I believe, just like how werewolves get stronger from those they consume, Quinn would have gotten stronger by the blood he absorbed.

"He realized this and asked us to get the blood of all five to help him. Quinn has never failed in protecting us before. He has always won the fights, even when no one thought he could. It was us that failed him. We didn't bring him the blood in time."

The room was somber, with both Sil and Peter still by Quinn's side knelt down. That's when Mundus walked across the room past everyone who was grieving and looked out at the portal.

"Immortui can't go through the portal just yet. Which means that there is still time," Mundus said out loud. He then turned to face the others.

"Do you all truly believe that if you had the blood, if Quinn had gotten it in time, he would have beaten Immortui?" Mundus asked.

The others didn't say much at first; they just looked at each other, with most of them nodding. But Peter had his back facing away from Mundus.

"What are you asking such a stupid question?" Peter said. "Of course he would, he'd kick his f*cking arse!"

Hearing the strong words from Peter, Mundus smiled. "Very well then, I shall give him his final chance."
