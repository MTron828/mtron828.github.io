One of the vampire squads that had been sent out in search of one of those that they wished to take part in this special team, had arrived on one of the Graylash planets. Not just any of the planets though, they were where the leaders of the Graylash family were based.

It was a location that had been built in the mountains,. Peaceful, with beautiful architecture that consisted mostly of temple-like shapes, while waterfalls were built in with flowing water in the area.

The group of vampires were being led by vampire knight Timo who was smaller than most vampires, but his power made it clear that he was worthy of being called a knight and one wouldn't dare disrespect him.

The group had arrived at this location and was now standing in a grand room directly in front of the leader of the Graylash family, Zinon. He looked to be in a somewhat weakened state as even now he was lying in his bedroom while important guests were in front of him.

"I see, so you wish to know the location of Chris." Zinon replied. "I can tell you that. I assume you are going to ask him to do a task for you. I just wish to warn you beforehand, it might not be as easy as you thought to convince him.

"You see at the moment Chris is acting as a Traveller mercenary, he is joining groups as they go off on hunts. There is a chance that he isn't on one of the Graylash planets at the moment, but I can tell you where he was last seen."

"Don't worry about that." Timo said with a bow. "We are quite skillful when it comes to tracking one down, and we also have a network of our own to use as well. As long as you can give us a lead, we will be able to find him."

Zinon smiled when he heard this.

"Oh, I had no doubt about that, what I meant was, it might be hard to convince him. You see me and Chris had spoken a few times after the events of what happened before. From everything he has been through, he feels slightly used.

"Used by Pure, used by Zero, and even used by Jack and Jim in the most recent situation. He never thought that his strength would become a burden that would be used on others. Right now to put it simply, I am afraid if you come to him with another request, he might feel like he is being used again."

The vampires had left Zinon to go to the last seen location of Chris, with what Zinon had said to them in mind. All they could do in this situation was ask, and they wouldn't give up until they had at least asked him.

Landing on one of the Graylash planets, the vampires felt more at peace than they did in other areas. After the first Dalki war, somehow the Graylash group had done a reasonably good job keeping the peace between vampires and humans.

There were still troubles here and there, with one group going against the other, but that always seemed to be the case. What they didn't get was more of an instant reaction of disgust.

"He was last seen at this travellers base." Timo said, looking up at the large square building. "Most likely when he has completed his hunt, he will return here."

The group waited and they were right on the money, as they saw Chris return with a big smile and the people around him had large smiles on their faces as well, as they thanked him and patted him on the back. They even heard a conversation where they had asked Chris to join their guild, but he had quickly refused as he walked to return to the quest board.

On his way there, he was stopped by the group dressed in black.

"Vampire knight Timo, here with a report from the vampire settlement!" Timo saluted.

There was a strange reaction that was occurring in all of the vampires, as they got close to Chris. It was a strange smell that was wafting into their nose. Without them realising it, out of their control their eyes were glowing red and their fangs were enlarging a little.

Timo could feel the strange sensation as well, but was holding it in as much as possible.

"It's best if you guys don't get too close to me, it seems more and more vampires are reacting to me lately." Chris said, taking a step back. "We both have good hearing so we don't need to be too close." VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

The vampires were dressed in complete black and not what Travellers would wear, like beast gear and such, were catching quite a bit of attention, as they realised that they were from the settlement. I think you should take a look at

"What does the settlement have to do with Chris?" One traveller asked. "Why are they meeting him here of all places."

Chris, due to his work, even though he had only been a Traveller for a short time, had earned a reputation among the others. He had been on multiple quests with other groups and thanks to him, he had saved many lives, so he was quite the hero to them.

"The settlement needs your help, we have a task that only you can do." Timo explained.

A large single "Ha" came out of Chris' mouth when he heard this.

"There are plenty out there that can do more than I do, besides you don't want me. Everything I touch, or everyone I help, it seems to me that I make things worse, or that I end up helping the bad guys instead."

There seemed to be a great pain in Chris when he said this.

"And what are you doing now?" Timo asked.

"Me? I am a mercenary. I charge a small fee and help others on their quests. So far nothing seems to have gone wrong, and I enjoy seeing the large smiles on everyone's face." Chris answered.

This was somewhat his way of repenting a bit after the mistakes he had made when helping Pure and helping Jim.

"As you have said, this is most likely because it has been your choice." Timo said. "I will ask you again, it is completely up to you. The vampire settlement is assembling a team, a team that is to go to the other side, to aid Quinn Talen.

"With the help of Logan we have evaluated the very best, and the strongest that will be up for this task. You are one of them. This is your decision to make, maybe you will feel like you are joining the wrong side again, but if you were to sit back and do nothing, and everything in front of you is destroyed, will you not feel even worse?"

The situation was certainly different to what Chris was expecting, and from the moment he had met Quinn he knew he was a good person, his gut was telling him something was different about him compared to all the other people he had met.

Maybe this time, rather than going with his head, he should go with his gut.

"Alright, I'll come with you, and fill me in on the details on the way." Chris answered.

Another one had joined the group, but the final person that they needed to convince was most likely to be the most difficult, an enemy or a friend no one really knew, but they knew he was strong and they needed the strong.
