Chapter 927 - Remembering everything

At first, it was tough for Quinn to stay in the shadow dome while everyone else was fighting outside. He had no clue what was happening. There was even a chance that he didn’t need to get involved at all.

However, just in case, Quinn knew he needed to recover and eventually had gotten into a special zone in his head. A particular mediation state that allowed him to recover his Qi as fast as possible, while in this state, though, his senses were a little dulled.

It made it so all his body’s energy was focused on only getting his Qi energy back, while the shadow dome would help him recover his MC points. Because of the zone and the shadow dome he was in, he even had less chance of knowing what was happening. Still, there was one thing he was thankful for.

The family connection to the Cursed family. Although it was active as those from the tenth fought and could feel they were struggling at times, he knew that not a single one had been lost. Quinn knew what that felt like now, and he knew how the system would act if that did happen and neither of those things had set off.

When he was ready, he had exited out of the dome, his Qi was at full strength, and his MC points had regenerated. In front of him, he could see his family members, but they weren’t their usual selves. The energy that was coming off from them, their hands and legs that were shaking, they all had one thing in common, they were afraid.

Each one of them was in fear due to the person in front of them, and that was Cindy. Seeing this, on instinct like a tiger going to protect its frightened cubs, Quinn stepped out in front of them all.

Now standing there, he finally had time to look at the situation.

’Did she do all of this?’ Quinn thought as he glanced around at the leaders that had fallen. ’She even managed to hurt Bryce that badly and there doesn’t look to be a single scratch on her. How strong is she?’

Quinn had to try and gauge the person in front of him. Quinn and Bryce had fought against each other recently, so he thought he could use that as a good measurement, but it didn’t seem to be the case at all.

[Inspect]

Quinn thought this was his only other option. Maybe it would bring some more light on the situation, but it wasn’t the quest he wished to see as Quinn received the quest.

[New quest received]

[Survive the encounter with the enemy in front of you]

’Survive?’ Quinn read the message as he thought back to when he was on the Blade island, and he was up against the twins. He had managed to get out of that one by escaping, but the system was right at the time. If he tried to fight back then, he probably wouldn’t have survived.

’You really think I can’t win this fight?’ Quinn thought, looking at Cindy in front of him and glancing at those behind him. ’System, you’re wrong! I have no choice. I have to win this fight, and when I do, you better give me a freaking big reward for proving you wrong.’

This was a fight that Quinn couldn’t just survive, he needed to win, so according to the system, he needed to do the impossible. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Quinn had the shadow raised behind his back, and he activated it just in case Cindy made an attack on those behind him. Yet, for some reason, she wasn’t attacking just yet. Based on the condition of the leaders around him, he didn’t think Cindy was trigger shy with her newfound powers.

’Just what exactly is she waiting for?’ Quinn thought.

In the end, he got the answer from Cindy herself.

"Go on then!" Cindy shouted. "I know why you’re so confident, why you chose to come out to save these people. You are just waiting to summon that damn Arthur like you did last time. Bring him out and let me crush him, so I can crush your only hope in front of you."

Hearing Cindy say this, the other leaders who had regained consciousness but weren’t exactly dead started to gain a little hope.

’That’s right, Arthur!’ Jin thought, propping himself on his forearm. ’If Quinn summons Arthur like last time, he might be the only person that can deal with Cindy.’

However, Arthur wouldn’t be coming this time. Quinn knew that, and so did those in the tenth family behind him. This was something that Quinn needed to do, himself.

"Why?" Quinn asked. "Why have you gone this far. Why are you going against your vampires, your own kind? You would have become Queen anyway! And what did you mean, what did you mean when you said both of our goals are the same. If that was true, then clearly we would be standing on the same side as each other right now."

"So you remembered my words," Cindy replied. "Well, you’re right, I might have been able to achieve my goal a lot easier if I was at the top, but it looked like you came to ruin my plans, Quinn. You see, my goal from the beginning was to get rid of every single one of these sc.u.m bag vampires and what better way to do it than to become their Queen.

’A little friend?’ Quinn started to think, the way she was speaking and what she had said. Quinn was thinking of a specific person. ’Did she get a vision when Cia went to regain her memories?’ Quinn thought.

"She has helped me out greatly. I don’t know how her vision would come true, perhaps you had found out my plans before everyone else, but I couldn’t risk it. So I had to stay one step ahead. It is a shame such a beauty like her had to fall."

"Shut up!" Layla screamed. "It was you. You were the one that had killed her!!" Layla shouted out in anger

"That was an accident. I didn’t want to kill any of you beauties, you were all meant to come over to my side, and soon we would create a new utopia away from all of these men. Destroying the old settlement to create an ideal new one." Cindy claimed.

Putting the pieces together, Layla’s anger and Cindy’s words. Quinn now knew which one of his family members had passed, and of all people, it was Cia.

’Cia, I’m sorry, I’m sorry for running your life. I took away your memories, and I regretted it ever since. From then on, I just wanted you to have a better life, and it looks like I just sent you to your executioner.’ Quinn thought as the anger was building up inside him. It was mainly at himself, but also at the one in front.

"Oh, you poor girl," Cindy said, shaking her head, and seemed quite genuinely concerned. "This is why I was unable to save you. Because you have already been trapped and have fallen for that man. There is no hope for you anymore." Cindy proclaimed.

"Why!" Jin shouted, listening in on everything. He had finally recovered enough from his own attack being used against him. He was in no way in fighting condition, but his will to find out why Cindy had done everything was pushing him through.

"Cindy, we trusted you! We thought you wanted to make the vampire settlement a better place. Why would you want to get rid of us!" Jin shouted.

"All of the words I said were true. I do want to create a better place. I just never was honest with how. That day when Rowa, my father died. I remembered everything. Everything that happened to me, and how the council and king did nothing! I was standing at the top of my castle, staring outward. The king was using the blood ability to finish him off but at that moment. Rowa looked towards me. At the time, I thought, just like everyone else, he deserved to die for attacking the vampire settlement.

"But before he disappeared, he did something. The final words out of his mouth, I could see them. ’My daughter, remember the past and take yours and my revenge.’ The words seemed simple, but reading them from his lips, and his hand stretched outward, something activated. He made it, so the memories that had been locked away for a long time resurface once more. And because of that, I will get rid of you all!" Cindy stated as she lifted her hands, and too large circles of blood were hovering by her side.

"Quinn, the blood ability may increase her blood powers exponentially, but it doesn’t make her any better of a fighter. If you make this a battle of powers, you will not win!" Vincent shouted in his head.

"So you’re saying I have to beat her physically, so there is only one option." Quinn replied, but there was silence as he knew exactly what to do.

Not hesitating anymore, Quinn started to fill up his Qi energy inside him, with the red energy all around, and in front of Cindy’s very eyes, he started to transform.

His hair started to fall from his head, his muscles were bulging out from his clothes, and his eyes were turning hollow. Those from the tenth family started to take a step back, and soon had retreated back to the stage, as they had seen this all before.

’Quinn, what are you doing. Are you going this far to beat her?!’ Silver thought, worried about what would happen after.
