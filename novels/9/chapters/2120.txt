Slowly opening his eyes, a bright white light was beaming in his face. It was hard for Quinn to see anything, but he could hear the voices around him.

"It's dad, his eyes are opening, I think he's waking up."

The soft voice that was heard was clearly Minny's, yet it sounded slightly distant, as if she was wearing a mask of some sort. He attempted to move the rest of his body, but it was very sore.

Aches and pains were all over, in particular there was a large pain in his back. Since he was unable to move, he tried to see just what was wrong with his body.

'Is it my muscles, it looks like they have been torn apart. They're regenerating on their own thanks to my body but it's going really slow. It reminds me of the time when Qi entered my body for the first time.'Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Because of this, Quinn went ahead to focus his Qi energy in helping speed up the cells in his body to repair himself, and while doing so he noticed something else as well, and that was his vampire aura. It had almost been completely depleted.

There was nearly none of it, if he was to try and use a blood slash now, he doubted he could perform one.

'Ever since I had the Ruler of Blood title, I haven't ran out of blood aura.'

Just like his body, it was regenerating, it was at a faster speed than his body, but it was still a shocking thing for him to see.

Finally, Quinn was able to move his head, and when he did, he could see a small squished up face right up against glass. Seconds later, and Minny was pulled away from the glass by her mother.

"Quinn." Layla said looking at him. "You idiot, just what were you trying to do that got you in this mess? Why do you always have to worry me, why can't you just be sensible for once."

Quinn didn't reply because he knew that this was her way of caring about him. Being more aware of the situation now. He realised that he was in some type of medical tube and the one that was doing the check up on him was Ceril.

"There is all sorts of different equipment in this room, and during my time here I fiddled with it and learned how to use them. Logan also prepared tutorials for their basic use, so don't worry, I know what I'm doing… mostly." Ceril said, as she continued to press a few buttons on the control console.

There were a few machines moving up and down scanning Quinn, and he could tell it was making his body feel better, so he would at least trust her for now.

"What happened? I'm not too sure myself." Quinn replied.

When he was finally able to move, and Ceril confirmed that was the case, he went to the training room, and the others weren't letting him out of their sight as they followed him.

Now inside, he could see the destruction all over the place, and even now, after an hour or so had passed in the medical room, there was the strange magma-like sludge that was seen all over the room.

'I did all of this?' Quinn thought to himself as he tried to remember, but that was the problem, he couldn't remember anything.

'The last thing I remember is going to my system screen, and selecting the new transformation… after that it's all gone, I can't remember anything.'

In a way, the system had treated this as an evolved form of the Bloodsucker. When Quinn had first turned into the bloodsucker, he wasn't in control of his body and ended up fighting with Sil.

Eventually, he had learned to control it, but there was a difference. When Quinn's Bloodsucker form ended, he did remember what had happened. He just was unable to act at the time, it felt like it was almost someone else, but here he had no clue whatsoever.

'This is very dangerous. If I don't know what I'm like in my demon from then I could end up hurting everybody. What would've happened if I had broken out of here? At the same time, if I can't think, then I won't be able to know the capabilities or train with this Demon form.'

Thinking about it more, there were even more side effects to the form, incredibly weak blood aura, and body soreness, or more so like his body was ripped apart.

If anything, it almost seemed like if the Demon form was unable to take out its opponent, then it would mean losing his life.

'Just from observing this room, it's hard to tell the capabilities or strength. There was no target, or anything to fight after all. I have no doubt if I was just to use my normal blood aura or guns I could break out of this room.

'So I doubt the power of this Demon form has really been shown just in this room alone, but is there any way to observe it at all? To see what it could do. Using it in a fight is an incredibly big risk.'

Looking at the others, Quinn's eyes soon landed on Russ.

"Russ, you were able to summon that dragon, and transform your body similar to that of the celestial you were fighting. How does your power exactly work?"

Russ smiled when looking back at Quinn.

"Do you really think I would reveal something as important as that to you? You're better off just asking what you want from me, and I'll give you a yes or no answer."

"If you were to make a copy of me, would it be able to do the things that I could do. In fact, what if it was a power of mine, one that you've never seen before?" Quinn asked.

Based on what happened, and what state the room was in, now Russ was starting to understand a little of what Quinn wanted him to do.

"There are two things you need to know. 1st, it is easier for me to copy a power, than it is a form or summon something like that dragon. However, when it comes to powers, although I can copy them, as you can imagine I have no clue how to use them.

"So I have to have seen it being used before, to emulate the same thing. However, when it comes to summoning things, it's quite different. Its strength is dependent on you and that's all I want to say on the matter. Now in a case like this, maybe there's a chance deep in your mind that you do have the memories of what happened, and I could help… but I can't help."

Russ' words were strange because one moment they were giving him hope and the next they were being dashed. Quinn wanted Russ to summon his demon form.

If that was possible, he could see its powers, and its strength, on top of that he could face it himself in his current form as a good way of training. If things got too dangerous, Russ could always de-summon the Demon form as well.

"I hate to say this, and I hate that you are making me say this, but you are too strong." Russ explained. "For me to use your powers, to create something that is as strong as you, or even stronger, it would be impossible with my MC cells.

"Once I tried to summon you, when Layla was in trouble, but it was too much. Unlike when I faced you, I no longer have the support I did back then."

Form what Russ was saying, Quinn had gathered it was due to a lack of MC cells. The more MC cells, then the stronger his powers and summons he could make. The thing was, Quinn did know of a way to increase Russ's MC cells, but the question was whether or not that was a good idea.

'Russ is helping us out for now, and increasing his power might not be such a bad thing, but he is not a good person, and the last thing I want to do is create another Jim or Jack that I would have to face.' With that thought, Quinn would put a pin in the idea.

For now, Quinn would have to put the transformation away, put it as something he was unable to use. At least until he figured out a way to use it, and would attempt to continue mixing his shadow and blood powers to create something else.

Around Ceril's wrist there was a watch that started to flash and make a small beeping noise, when she looked at it, a smile appeared.

"It looks like the coordinates have been downloaded. We can finally set off." Ceril said, and the group didn't waste any time leaving Earth.
