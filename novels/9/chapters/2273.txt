The faster one was, the more damage one could make. This was the philosophy and the way of fighting for the Penswi. Adding more weight to the attack with their sharpened hand claws would allow them to almost pierce anything.

Yet, Stark was unable to pierce Jack's special shield of energy. He even had his own set of demon-tier armour that supported him, making him faster than before, his body and strength stronger than before. He was unable to break through the barrier.

Stark's hands were bloody, they were in pain. Even when moving his legs, the small movement in the air caused shocks of pain through his body. His hands had never been in this state before, but it made sense.

He had used his whole body as a weapon in an attempt to crash through the barrier, and now all of the damage had been reversed to him instead. Many in his situation wouldn't dare do what he was attempting to do next after what had happened, but it was the only thing Stark knew.Vissit nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for ùíèew ùíèovels

'I have to go faster!'

[Nitro Accelerate activated]

The skill had cooled down since he had last used it, so he could use it once again. Running through the sand, one moment Jack saw Stark; the next, he was out of sight. His bloody fist was raised and slammed right into the energy shield.

Just like before, the shield rippled due to the attack, and it was rippling much faster compared to before.

"Ha... haha!" Jack had nervous laughter. He had braced himself this time and hadn't fallen over, but he now had a good look at Stark's hand. It was unrecognisable. Blood had even splattered on top of the energy shield and started to disperse into the air.

"I never expected... to take it out in a single hit... I'll get you, I'll get you no matter what!" Stark shouted.

As if Stark had teleported, once again, Jack had lost sight of him, but he could see a large impact coming from behind on the energy shield. He turned his head, but Stark wasn't there, and now ripples were coming from all over the place, all over the energy shield with nothing but a blur that could be seen from time to time.

On the energy shield, there were blood splatters all over. The entire thing was being covered in parts of blood here and there as the entire area shook. Even being inside the energy ball, it felt like he could feel the energy slowly seeping in, hitting his body, causing a tingling sensation on the outer part of his clothing.

'What is this... just how fast is he moving... will the shield... will it really not hold up?'

For now, the shield was holding up, but Jack hadn't really been in a situation where he needed to test the full capabilities of the shield in his armour set. It was always a defensive measure to just buy time, time until others started to arrive.

And it didn't take long for that to happen. Breaking into the sand area from above was a Dalki that crashed into the sand. Meanwhile, a few humans had entered from the regular entrance and were running towards Jack.

"You might have thought you got me, but I knew all along that I would be safe. Look at this, it looks like you lose!" Jack laughed.

However, the smile on his face soon started to disappear because, completely ignoring his words, Stark continued to attack the shield again and again. There was no sign of slowing down, and it seemed like he was completely ignoring those who had just arrived.

The Dalki had arrived, and it was moving its eyes back and forth. It had stopped just short of the two, but it had no clue what to do. It then raised its fist and attempted to hit the blur it could see.

The fist had gone straight ahead, and the Dalki had hit the outside of the barrier, causing a ripple of his own.

"What are you doing, you big stupid monster!" Jack shouted.

The Dalki turned again but was unable to keep track of Stark. He was simply too fast. Soon others had arrived, and they too continued to use their powers in an attempt to catch him.

For Stark, he didn't even have to focus. Everything, their attacks, their movements, all of it was so slow to him. It was easily avoidable, and in truth, he perhaps could have spent some time dealing with them, but he was so focused on one thing, and one thing only, and that was getting to Jack.

Stark continued to go through the attack, attacking the shield of energy, not sure if it was doing anything or not, but he didn't care.

'I've lost all feeling in my legs. Using the armour's speed, it's even tougher on my body... but I can't give up here. If I fail, there's a good chance they will continue onward and get rid of all the Penswi, all those people that supported me!'

Stark pounded the energy shield, and the shield seemed to flicker at that point. Whatever it was he was doing, it was working.

'I just... I can tell I'm so close.'

[Nitro accelerate has ended]

Unlike Quinn, Stark didn't have a system, so he didn't see any such messages, but he could feel that he lost the power from the armour.

'Screw it!' Stark said to himself as he saw this message.

Using his regular speed, could he avoid the attacks still? It was quite possible, but there was still a big worry in his mind. Would he be able to do enough damage to the shield? His own hands were no longer sharp, his bones were practically sticking out of the end of them.

His body could handle the speed, but when attacking, strong shock waves would travel through his body, and now not just his hands were being affected, but everything.

'I know... I know Quinn said... that the armour, there was a way to force it, to force it to use its active skill,' Stark thought as he ran back away from the others. He stood still, and for the first time, the humans and the Dalki were able to see who it was, and Jack could take a good look at the one that was causing him so much trouble.

"A power like that was bound to run out at some point," Jack thought. There was sweat running down the side of his head. He wanted to say more, he wanted to relax his body, but in a way, he felt like that it would just prove that, for a moment, he was afraid.

"Take him out!" Jack ordered.

Everyone in the area went towards Stark, and he was left looking at them, trying to come up with a solution.

'He said that I could lose my life... I never imagined that my life would end like this,' Stark thought. 'But thanks to all of them, thanks to all their cheers and support, I got to live a good life, and I got to become the fastest person in existence.

'What's the point of being fast if I can't use that speed in some way to help out everyone? Come on, armour, you like me, right? So let me ask you one more time, for you to help me out right here and now!'

[Forced Nitro accelerate has been activated]

The armour started to glow faintly, and immediately Stark could feel an energy being sucked out from him. It was a sensation he had never felt before. He was already feeling weak, but it was as if he could feel the life force coming out of him.

Although Stark didn't have a system, he could almost feel something was wrong.

[Error... Error]

[Celestial blood is not detected]

[Replacement blood is being used]

[Unknown effect... will take place.]
