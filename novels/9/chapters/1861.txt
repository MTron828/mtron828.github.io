Chapter 1962: Heartbroken. (Part 2)

By the time Chris finished recounting his story, the mood had turned heavy, and the others were left in a heavy silence. At first, some of them believed that the whole story was made up, an elaborate plan to fool them into believing that Chris truly wanted to go against Zero.

However, as the story went on, it was harder and harder for Chris to even speak properly. His voice was shaken, his eyes were teary, and he had even passed a few moments. It was as if he was reliving those days all over again.

Technically, for Chris, all of this had happened a long time ago, and yet, he hadn't forgotten any of it. Not a single detail of what had transpired. At the same time, the others had gotten what they asked for, to find out the truth of what had happened between Erin and Leo that day.

— Wahhhh! — A loud cry began coming from Minny of all people. — This... this is so sad! The pretty girl and the blind man were meant to get together. They finally... they finally...told each other they liked each other.

Minny couldn't hold in her sadness, but what she said was true, and the others felt the same way. Fate had been utterly cruel to all three of them. For Peter, though, this had hurt him quite a bit. Emotions that he didn't think he had were starting to resurface inside of him.

— Erin... is this really the same Erin as before? We... did so much for her... and Leo did so much for her. So how the f*ck could she be so heartless and do something like that? None of that story made any sense.

Hearing Minny cry, Lucia was also interested in one aspect of the story.

— After... what happened to Silver after Leo's death? — Lucia asked.

The story was like a TV drama series they were watching, but just like in a TV series, there were a lot of loose ends that they needed to find out about.

— I... didn't join Zero straight away, — Chris answered. — My heart ached too much. I knew that whatever he needed me to do, I wasn't ready for it. I think he knew that as well and that I would seek him out when I felt better.

— Instead, I stayed with what was left of Leo and Silver. She stayed with Leo's lifeless body in her arms for an entire day. The other vampires that we were meant to be protecting had returned and showed their respects and needed someone to help them.

— I helped them, thinking that maybe that's what Leo would have wanted me to do. After connecting them back with the vampire soldiers and giving them safe passage, I returned, and Silver was still there like a statue, not having moved for a long time. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

— In the end, I said that it would be best if we buried Leo to allow him to rest in peace, and she agreed. t She said that there was often a planet, a shelter that Leo would talk about. One where he spent most of his time.

— A shelter that was privately funded by him for years and years to come, but if the two of them were to really get together and retire, she imagined it would have been there. It was a good place to pick, and I understood why Leo loved such a place when I reached there. It was so peaceful, with a calm river nearby the Shelter.

— Even the people were cheerful. It was as if they were away from everything, all the conflict and trouble. After that, we both bid farewell to each other, and that was the last time I saw Silver. I have no clue where she went and how she is. I don't even know if she's even alive.

By now, all the girls in the room had tears in their eyes. They couldn't even imagine what it was like to love someone so much that after losing them, they never wanted to leave their side, not even for a second, even in their death.

— I did not know this, — Muka sighed.

— I actually know what happened to Silver later on. At the time, the vampire settlement was still active. We were struggling to function properly since we were unable to elect a leader, but things were still going okay.

— Silver had returned to the vampire settlement. She didn't say a word to anyone. Not to her brother, me or any of the other leaders, and at the time, had just gone into an Eternal slumber.

— She chose that if she couldn't live with the man she loved, then there was no point in continuing her life anyway, — Jessica mumbled.

— When someone loses someone dear to them, people react in different ways, — Muka explaine.

— Some let anger take over and go for revenge. Others try to replace that deep missing part of their heart, to try to heal the wounds, and others decide... well, we know what happened to Silver.

The group had learned the entire truth of the Erin and Leo saga, and it seemed like what Chris had told Quinn had matched up, but there was something that didn't match up.

— Why did Erin kill Leo? — Peter blurted out loud. — My head hurts every time I try to think about it, but why? It makes no sense.

— You are right, — Jessica replied with her finger on her chin. — From what you and Quinn have said, Erin was Leo's student for a very long time. She was part of your group until the Dhampir urges began to take her over.

— Yet, we learnt from the Dhampirs that they have long since been able to control their urge to kill, and that was thanks to Erin herself. Did she still have the urge back then? Could she not control it?

Listening to this had propped up Chris to listen in more because he had never thought about this. Chris didn't know much about the relationship between Leo and Erin. He had learnt a few things here and there from Leo but just assumed at some point they had become enemies for one reason or another.

— If you ask me... it seemed like she already had it under control, — Chris answered. — Although she was acting on emotion, it wasn't as if there was something in her body controlling her. Back then, I had a strong understanding of energies and Qi, and although I never learned the ability Leo had, I learnt to sense it. To me, the vibe and energy that she was giving off was pure anger.

— She truly seemed like she hated him from the comments after she killed him. For one reason or another, she has a deep hatred against vampires.

— Maybe something happened to her, — Mitchell added. — Between the time that she left Leo and met up with the two of you. There is a lot that could happen in that time, and the cause of it could have been a vampire.

— To build up hatred that strong? — Peter replied back. — I don't buy it. Maybe you guys don't understand, but the two of them were like father and daughter. Let's say a vampire killed a friend she made or something. That still wouldn't explain why she had acted in such a way if it wasn't the urge.

The whole group was left at a standstill. They felt like they weren't in a better situation to understand Erin compared to before. Either way, they would pass this information to Layla and see what she thought about the whole thing. Telling Quinn would be difficult as well because Peter knew that after hearing how Erin had treated Leo, Quinn wouldn't care what happened and would take her out.

— Thank you for sharing your whole story with us, — Muka said.

— But there is still one thing that doesn't make sense, and that is you. I can understand why you went back to Zero after all this time, but then why now, after all these years, have you decided to go against Zero?

Clenching his fist, Chris gave an answer.

— Because right now, Zero is working with the one person I could never ever forgive. The reason why Zero isn't here is that he is working with Erin to take down Green city.
