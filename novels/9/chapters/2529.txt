Chapter 2530 ¬†Sil's last gift

Unzoku had been blasted a large distance away, somewhere into the land of hardened seas. The terrain looked like a giant sea had been frozen over, but rather than ice, it was hardened rock material.

The Demon King had crashed through several objects and landed on his way over, and he was now lying on the floor. A large wound was in the middle of his stomach, an entire hole that one could see through.

It was bleeding, but the muscles were still moving about on the inside, small parts of the black flame burning and making it hard for him to heal.

"Haha!" Unzoku laughed to himself as he looked at the sky. "Did they really think I was that much of a threat that they had decided they all needed to attack me at once? What a bunch of pathetic people."

It was strange again; the wound on his body was taking a lot longer to heal, but Unzoku was nowhere near at the stage of death, nor was he in a rush to get back. As he lifted the top half of his body, he looked in the distance, and he could tell the red bloodstone was no longer being used to open up the other portal.

"This is getting to be rather troublesome, a lot more than Immortui suspected. There is a chance that he might not make it through this."

While having these thoughts, portals started to open up above his head, three in total. They were white in colour, and swarming out from them were large groups of Divine beings.

"Is someone watching this whole thing? Are they trying to get rid of me, thinking that this is their chance? What foolish people!" Unzoku thought as he swung his arm, taking out one entire swarm of Divine beings.

Quinn had appeared right in front of Immortui in his new form. To Immortui, he had already won a fight against the vampire and he had used everything he had. So what difference would it make to him if he was to face him again? Surely he couldn't have gotten stronger again in the short amount of time. It had been less than an hour since their last battle. Yet, Immortui had used the same move that had trapped and worked against him before, but this time it had failed.

"My shadow powers, since they're mixed in with the blood aura, it's a lot stronger than before. An attack like that would have ripped through my shadow unless condensed, but now it's almost as if all of my shadow is condensed. This battle is going to be completely different from the last time!"

Quinn could see that Immortui had raised his hand; he was ready to activate the colourless ability. He wouldn't have used it before, for fear it would disturb the crystal opening the portal, but now he needed to stop the others.

Quinn threw the spear made from his own blood. As it traveled in the air, it seemed to gain more power from the currents of blood that Quinn could see around it. Rather than dealing with the spear directly, from Immortui's shoulder, one of the serpents opened its mouth, ready to fire at the spear. Before it did, though, a shadow portal opened in front of the spear. It completely disappeared and reappeared, hitting Immortui right in his back. It had pierced right through, and he could see a blood-pointed end.

"This weapon has pierced my skin?" Immortui was in disbelief, especially at seeing so much of his own blood. Not only that, but the particles of blood on the spear itself started to rise, and before he knew it, it went straight at him, trying to attack him. The blood splatters being destroyed by his thick veil of red mist aura. Grabbing the weapon, Immortui was ready to pull it out. However, the effect of the Blood Shadow was in effect, and he felt a great force pushing him from behind again.

He was lifted off his feet as the force in the throw from the initial spear and the power of the attack had appeared right again, and he was heading straight toward Quinn. With the blood that Quinn had used before to create the spear, he had shifted it around his arms to create gauntlets that were the same dark purple with an inner glowing red colour around them.

He swung his fist right toward Immortui's face. Before it reached through, Immortui had gathered his colourless ability in his hand and grabbed Quinn's fist. The shockwave of blood power rippled out, destroying the ground beneath his feet for miles, showing just how much power had been placed in the hit.

With his other hand, Immortui had grabbed the spear and pulled it out of himself. T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

"You seem to have gotten stronger, but you have no idea how much power I have!" Immortui slammed the spear at the side of Quinn, hitting him with strength that erupted one-half of the planet's sky.

Quinn took the hit and broke the spear down with his powers. He could see the serpents on Immortui's back were moving; they were opening their mouths, ready to attack. Condensed red mist energy shot out of them both.

Pulling his arm away with force, Quinn managed to break free in time and quickly moved his wings in to block the attacks. The red condensed energy hit him hard, making him fall to the ground, but the attack eventually stopped.

When Quinn opened up his wings, blood blotches started to form on them.

[Shadow Blood Rain]

Out from his wings, countless drops of blood shadow shot out at once, hitting Immortui's body non-stop. The armour around his legs had reacted after the first bullet touched his skin and covered his whole body.

'What is this, this strange power? I can feel it doing something to me!'

Immortui jumped in the air, but the raining attack from Quinn's wings continued. The serpent opened its mouth again, firing off a condensed beam hitting Quinn and sending him crashing into the ground. The barrage from his wings had stopped for a moment.

Seeing an opportunity, several red portals opened up around Quinn, and the giant red mist fists came out, all towards him. They continued to punch the ground, but there was no Quinn.

A portal in the air, Quinn had appeared out of right behind Immortui. Lifting his arm, an image of a giant blood sword had appeared, and throwing it down, it had crashed on top of Immortui, sending him crashing right down into the ground.

Soon after, a large mist fist appeared at Quinn's side and had knocked him to the side, hitting him away as well.

The fight was intense, with both sides fighting at full power with all they had from the get-go.

"What are you waiting for!" Hikel shouted, as they were all standing by the portal. "We have to go now!"

Sil and both Peter were hesitant to go through the portal as they watched Quinn's battle raging on. Sil could feel it; although Immortui was using the full extent of his powers, it felt like he still wasn't in a desperate enough situation to summon it all yet. It was worrying him.

The fact that Immortui had already received a few big hits and wasn't slowing down either was a major concern as well.

"We have to go now!" Chris said. "You said it yourself Sil, this is the best thing we can do for him."

Russ had already jumped through the portal, with no concern for the others. He wasn't wasting any time, and Edvard had as well. With his injuries, even the shockwaves from the fight were hurting him.

"I have to leave him, just one more thing, one more thing that might help him out in this fight!" Sil thought, as he placed his hands on the ground. "I don't have enough MC cells to summon someone like Immortui, or the other Demon Kings, they are just far too powerful, but there is someone who I think can be a great help to you. Someone who you think very highly of and is incredibly strong, do what you can to help him!"

Out from the ground, a portal of shadows appeared, rising up from those shadows with long black hair and a large sword on his back. It was none other than the leader of the punishers.

"Help him, Arthur!" Sil shouted.

Arthur was ready for battle, and he knew the stakes were high as he joined the fray.
