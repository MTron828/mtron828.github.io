Chapter 1183 The Family returns

Apart from Quinn, Shiro and Sil, the others had yet to see the new humanoid beast that now housed Vorden’s consciousness. Once he had boarded the ship, the Cursed group was finding it hard to keep their eyes off him.

His beast form looked similar to what Quinn had seen the previous day. He was still mostly covered in black fur with a seemingly gigantic tail on his back, but his evolution gave his appearance a few slight changes.

As a King-tier beast his tails had been bunched up together and similar to a flower it had made it hard to tell if it was one piece or not, but now that the tails had grown longer they started to resemble a scorpion’s stinger. They curved up as they were inches off the ground and hovered around the shoulder area before curving back down again.

On top of that, there were now what looked like hard pieces similar to a fin sticking out from the beast’s forearms, yet there was soft fur on top of them.

’It looks like with each evolution his form will continue to change and grow. I guess it will be harder to tell with Raten since the Demi-god tier beats’ ability covers what his real body looks like.’ Quinn thought.

"You look damn cool!" Fex exclaimed excitedly, sticking his hand out, trying to stroke Vorden’s body. "A lot better than Muddy over there. Tails is a lot cooler."

"Muddy? Tails?" Layla repeated, slightly confused.

"Nicknames for the beasts. Their minds are still in the bodies as well, so I thought it might be a good way for us to differentiate between when the Blade boys are in control and when the beasts are." Fex explained

Now that was a good point to make. It would be hard to keep track if they were to constantly call them, the Demi-god tier beast and the Emperor tier beast. The only problem was whether or not the beasts were okay with these nicknames, but at least they hadn’t protested so far.

As expected, after evolving they would need to consume more crystals to continue to get stronger. Unfortunately, a lot of crystals from Muddy’s stash had been used by Quinn to allow Tails’ body to evolve one stage. With the crystal shortage in general, it was hard to gather the amount they would need, even for the Cursed faction.

To solve this problem, Quinn had asked Alex to prepare the blood crystals that they had received from the Vampire World. He was hoping that perhaps the beasts could process those crystals as well. It was a heavy investment, but Quinn was sure that if they could evolve to Demon tier beasts it would all be worth it.

After everyone had the chance to inspect Vorden’s new look, he went on over to where Layla currently was, the two of them looked at each other.

"Hello, Layla. Long time no see, I guess." Vorden said, trying to crack a joke.

Back at military school the two of them hadn’t started off the best way, but soon they had grown closer through their experiences together. The girl walked up to Vorden and gave the humanoid beast’s body a big hug without hesitation. It was quite an experience to feel the soft fine fur, and her head was on the level of the beast’s hard abs.

"It’s good to have you back." Layla moved a few steps away to smile at Vorden.

In that brief moment, she had realised something. The spark that she used to have for Vorden had disappeared. Layla wasn’t sure if it was due to Vorden inhabiting Tails’ body, or if it was because of the time they had spent apart from each other, but looking at him and speaking to him, she didn’t have the same feelings that she felt for someone else. Perhaps due to her coming clean about her feelings her mind had made its own resolve.

’I guess this means I know who I really like now. Unless I’m really that shallow and can’t have feelings for Vorden now that he is in the body of a beast?’ Layla looked towards Sil, but even looking at him she had never felt anything, so she couldn’t have been going for Vorden just due to his looks.

Arriving at the Cursed ship, everything seemed to be as they left it. There were no signs of sudden attacks or trouble. Quinn had been half expecting Pure, the Dalki, heck maybe even some stragglers from Innu’s group to attack them while he, as the leader had been away, but luck seemed to have been on their side for once.

As their ship landed, there were already a couple of people more than eager to welcome them. Sam, Peter and Borden stood at the docking bay waiting in anticipation for them to arrive. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Exiting from the ship, they saw Quinn, the others with the addition of two powerful humanoid beasts. Sam’s instincts were kicking in, telling him he should be running for his life, his hands even shaking in fear.

"My brother!" Borden shouted as he leapt forward and jumped on top of the mud beast’s shoulders. "I could sense the strong power coming off from you. As expected, I knew my brother wouldn’t just accept a normal body. Only the best is suited for him!"

"Borden." Sil called out. "Wrong one."

"Get off me, you little runt!" Raten complained, as his arms moved to grab Borden, attempting to throw him off from his shoulder. However, the two of them entered a power struggle as Borden used all his strength.

"You tricked me, I thought you were my brother!" Borden shouted.

"Borden, it’s nice to see you again." Vorden spoke, and hearing his voice, albeit distorted, Borden quickly pushed off his legs, breaking some of the mud on the beast’s shoulder and leapt over to Tails’ shoulder instead. Raten grumbled, yet his damaged shoulders healed at a visible speed.

"Little Borden, you haven’t been slacking off I see. I’m happy to see you as well." Vorden patted Borden’s head.

There was such a heartfelt pure smile as the two of them looked at each other, that one person in perticular didn’t really know what to do. Another walked up to him, all he did was give a slight punch to Vorden’s stomach.

"You can’t leave us like that." Peter spoke up. "If anyone deserves to leave this world before you do, It’s me, and at the moment I’m pretty hard to kill so remember that. Come with us, there’s something we need to show you."

Hearing this Borden seemed to smile, but Vorden had no idea what it could be about. He had been told the extent of things that had changed, but actually seeing it all was a different thing altogether.

"It should be okay, I have informed the Cursed members that we have two beasts tamed under us, so they shouldn’t be too shocked. Just don’t get too close to the others, please." Sam cautioned knowing how his own body felt, perhaps others would faint just seeing them.

Soon, Peter and Borden were practically dragging Vorden with them. Raten didn’t care for whatever they wanted to show him, he was more interested in just getting some rest in. For now, he would look after the little bomb, Sil.

As the two continued to drag him through the ship. Vorden twisted his head left and right, at all the amazing sights he could see. When he had split from Quinn and the others it had been so long and he had been trapped on that island.

’Quinn you became a World Leader and you’re really starting to change the world. I wish I had a goal like you. What do I want to do?’ Vorden thought, and eventually they had reached a hallway where the sound of excited talking was being heard from outside.

Sliding the door open, a room full of kids could be seen, but they weren’t just any kids.

"Do you remember them? These are all the kids from Blade Island that you wanted to save back then! We’ve been taking care of them ever since. I think it would be good to know that they can finally say thank you." Peter explained.

Back with Sam, there was a lot to be done. Still, after such a trip he granted the group a break period. For Quinn the job list felt endless, he wanted to discuss a few things with Layla about Pure and her powers, check up on Nate and the faction, catch up with Sam about the Cursed planets and Helen, and check up with Alex and the Demon tier weapon.

’So what exactly do you plan to do now? It seems that Sil still has his powers so he should be able to move the beast. Although the person in the tablet did warn you he wouldn’t be strong enough for that, but we still need to comply with Eno’s wishes.’ Vincent asked.

’I still dont think I’m strong enough to fight that dragon. When I used the gauntlet on those crystals, now comparing the two powers I could tell, and there are still problems with those that are part of the Pure group when fighting, but what I want to do more than all of that, is bring the last person back, you Vincent.’
