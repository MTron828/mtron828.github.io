Chapter 516 Ability marke

The girls had decided to accept Xander and Amy‚Äôs offer of staying the night. They needed to wait for whenever Paul would be free, giving his detailed report at the castle. They would then ask him a few questions when he got back, mostly to do with Cia. In the meantime, they could try to learn as much as possible from Amy and Xander.

Through them talking, they had found out a few things about the two of them. The house they were in now belonged to Xander, and he had one of the biggest rooms in the house. The group found out that it was because of Xander in the first place that they were living in the inner castle area. Originally, Xander‚Äôs family were in the pooling area, and they had Amy and her family working for them. This was because they were there turners from many many years ago.

However, one of the teachers had seen Xander‚Äôs talent and wanted him to learn the first‚Äôs ability, inviting him to live in the inner circle area. Still, he had yet to learn the first ability before all of this had happened. Therefore it was an easy decision for them to kick him out of the inner circle area.

They hadn‚Äôt kicked him out of the family, but all of his hopes and his family‚Äôs hope of them one day rising was dashed. Which meant the better option for them was to try to gain favour with a different family.

Because of this, Xander‚Äôs family didn‚Äôt really blame him for what he had done. It was due to him that they were even able to live in such luxury for a short while.

Hearing this, Layla really felt like she had gotten Xander completely wrong. She thought he was born into this position and was just riding the wave, but it sounded more like Xander had gotten wrapped into this lifestyle when he was being treated differently. It had all gotten to his head a little.

After their talk, it was time for them to get some sleep, and Xander had given up his large room for the girls to use, while he would sleep in Amy‚Äôs. There was plenty of space for all of them, and Xander was clearly not welcome to spend a night with the girls.

Still, the girls weren‚Äôt simply just going to go to sleep. They had too much to talk about. To start with, Amy had described each of the thirteen families abilities. Some of them, she could only describe what they looked like. For example, the first ability, she didn‚Äôt really know how it worked. While others were easy to explain.

"You have to remember, though, it will be impossible for any of you to learn these thirteen abilities," Amy said. "They are reserved for family members only, and because you are in the tenth family, you can really only learn the tenth ability. And even that is a strange situation and a half."

For Cia, it wasn‚Äôt a complete waste listening to all the families abilities, for one of them stood out to her. It was the second family‚Äôs power. It was the ability to reverse time on a certain part of the body they touched. The way it had been explained is, it was a stronger ability then healing.

Rather than heal the wound, it would reverse time on the wound itself bringing it back to what it once was. Cia was wondering if the ability would be able to be used to bring her memories back. If she remembered correctly, the second leader hadn‚Äôt got involved in the fightback then.

She was one of the leaders that were against the first leader. So not all hope was utterly lost.

"What about the vampires that chose not to have one of the thirteen abilities. Where do they get them?" Erin asked. Honestly, some of the thirteen abilities sounded interesting. Still, if she couldn‚Äôt get any of them, it was just a waste of time to think about it.

Now that she was a vampire made by Quinn, she was stuck with the tenth family.

"There are several ability books that are sold in the marketplace, although there are better ones that get sold in the auction. However, I doubt you guys would have the stuff to trade here." Amy said.

"What do you use for money?" Layla asked.

"Mostly beast crystals, since the whole place is powered by them. There aren‚Äôt many that turn it into beast gear like you guys have, but we use them for our everyday items." Amy explained.

The group didn‚Äôt really have a large supply of beast crystals with them. They never expected they would be in such a situation where they could just head down to the auction house and buy something in this world. The more they thought about it, their situation had done a complete 180 turn on them.

"I‚Äôll ask Xander, we might not have enough crystals to spare for the auction house but who knows, maybe you will spot something from the market," Amy said with a smile. VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

The girls thanked Amy for how much she was helping them. They needed to be careful about what ability they chose as they could only pick one. It was the same as when they were on earth, and whatever money was spent they promised they would give back at some point.

The next day had arrived, and just like Amy said, her and Xander, along with the girls, went down to the settlement centre. Where there was indeed a market, selling all sorts of times. Accessories, jewellery, clothes and ability books.

The group stayed close together, as the girls didn‚Äôt really know what they were doing and didn‚Äôt want to get separated. They looked at several things, not just ability books and Xander even tried to buy Layla a nice necklace.

It was clear he still had feelings for her, but Layla was unable to accept the gift. If she did, she would have just felt bad about it. She didn‚Äôt want to lead him on when in her heart, she still had another, and perhaps another one was starting to enter it as well.

Eventually, after lots and lots of looking, the only one who had selected an ability at the end of the day so far was Layla. She had chosen to stick to her telekinesis ability. This time though, she had bought the level 2, 3, and 4 books.

Now that her body had changed maybe she was no longer limited to her old cap. Maybe she could improve her ability more. The main reason for her choosing this ability was due to her third form of evolution.

There were three fireballs that she could use, one was healing, one was a buff, as well as a debuff, and the other was attack. She felt like with her arrow, shooting these fireballs towards her allies and targets would be easier if she had the telekinesis ability.

She also already knew how to use it and didn‚Äôt need to learn how to fight with something completely new. She thought long and hard, and eventually, this was the decision she had made.

As for Erin, she didn‚Äôt realise it herself until she had appeared at the market. She was constantly looking at the abilities hoping to see something to do with her old Ice ability. Unfortunately, according to Amy, this was not one of the abilities that were compatible with both humans and vampires.

Which meant, she would need to choose a new one. Hearing this news, she really couldn‚Äôt think as she looked at all the abilities.

"Well, don‚Äôt worry too much. Once you‚Äôre settled, you can save up some crystals." Amy said. "Then head to the auction house. I‚Äôm sure there will be plenty of useful abilities for you there."

As for Cia, she was never really looking at the abilities in the first place. Every chance she would get, she had tried to find out information on which castle was the second castle, and to see if there was any way she could get in.

She wanted to ask the leader if she could get her abilities back, but what could she bargain for? The leader had no reason to help her at all, and this was her main problem.

After a full day of shopping, the girls returned to Xander‚Äôs house once more for a second night of sleep. Amy had received news that Paul should be returning tomorrow and they could finally ask him about Cia‚Äôs abilities.

Elsewhere many things were happening at the same time.

It was the third day since Quinn had entered the underground chambers. The boys were busy at the mountain, and the girls were staying at Xander‚Äôs house. At this point and time, each one of them woke up, hoping that they could get some progress done that day.

Even Quinn, he had chosen to get ready to leave the castle and head off to talk to Arthur. Not only did he think he could get confirmation about the first leader, but also take him up on his offer with the training.

However, all their hopes were dashed as everyone in the entire settlement had received a message from the eighth vampire leader. This included Quinn, the boys in the mountain, and the girls.

"This is an emergency. All vampires who are out from the settlement are to return immediately. I repeat all vampires who are out of the settlement are to return immediately.

"Leaders are to head to the council room now. The vampire settlement has been discovered... we are being invaded."
