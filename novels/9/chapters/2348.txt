Quinn and the others had arrived, landing at the edge of the facility. They were close to a number of terminals and yet there was no worker right where they were. That's because they were all in the arena-like place down below, all of them providing their power straight toward Jessica. 

"What's with that disguise!" Magnus said. "Do you think you can trick me with that, with as much energy coming off from you, it can only be you, Quinn Talen!"

Jessica looked up as she heard the name, and the other vampires in question were also wondering what Magnus was talking about. They all knew Quinn Talen was the one who they were going to have to face off against, and on top of that, where was he? None of them could see him. 

"I see, I guess you're right, there's no need for this thing, because I'm going to put a stop to it all." Quinn reached out to his face and scratched it with his finger nails leaving a red claw mark behind. The mask on his face fell crumbling into separate segments. 

As the pieces fell to the floor, everyone was able to see the familiar face, the leader of the vampire settlement, the hero, and the vampire that was practically referred to as a god. 

"What's wrong!" Magnus said, as he could feel uneasy tension behind him. "You all knew that we would be going up against him, did you think he just would never turn up? Remember who we have on our side. They may call him a god, but that is a name only, the one we serve is the real vampire god, our creator Immortui!"

Hearing the talk of Quinn, Jessica looked right ahead, she couldn't believe it. Her heart almost felt like it was about to tear apart, as an overwhelming amount of emotions came to her. 

Of all people, the people she believed that wouldn't come, or help her, of all the people she could trust, the one and only Quinn was here for her. Just like he was back then, he was here once again. 

"Quinn!!!" Jessica shouted out. "Save me!" She screamed at the top of her lungs, it was more than a cry for help, the depression could be felt.

"We need to stop those vampires from powering her." Edvard said. "It might be best if we deal with them from here." 

Magnus started to laugh out loud as he heard what Edavrd said. 

"It seems you are smarter than you look, and smarter than you have been before, but it's too late. The second you guys came here, you fell for it, you fell for everything. I would like to thank you all for coming here, because if you never did, then this plan would have never worked!"

There was a worry in the back of Quinn's mind, a worry that had always been there from the beginning. Immortui claimed that he was the one that he needed, but how would Quinn even be used to open the portal? 

When they heard Jessica's power the way it worked, he thought that maybe, just maybe he would be the trigger he needed to open the portal, but could Magnus really guess that Quinn would save Jessica. 

Especially when he was disguised and there was no news of him being anywhere. Whatever the case was, it seemed Quinn's fears were true. 

Magnus stomped on the ground and all of the strange runes and shapes on the platform they were on, started to glow brightly. The red energy instead of going to Jesscia went up in the air, and now above them there was another magic circle. 

It was floating, moving about in the air, twisting and turning. Seeing this, Quinn went to attack it, throwing out a blood swipe. When it hit the magic circle in the air though, it went right through it, and the magic circle continued to move. 

"With this, not a single person's energy on the island will go to waste." 

Underneath Quinn and all the others, the same special runes that were in the metal arena were now under them. Not just them but everywhere they looked they could see runes all over the place. 

Before they knew it, power was flowing out of them, out of their control, and all of it was going right to Jessica in the centre. The second it hit her, the entirety of her eyes went yellow. 

There was a glow all over her body, and lifting her head up toward the sky she opened up her mouth. An energy beam consumed her whole body and went up far in the sky. It shot through the centre of the magic circle and continued to go up until it reached the clouds. 

When it did the energy blast had somewhat stopped splitting the clouds apart, and started to hit one area. As it did, a strange hole started to appear from the sky. It was slowly growing larger, and they could see it, a red sky. 

All of them on the island started to feel a strange sense of pressure on their chest, it was hard for them to even stand. 

"Is this the power of the other world… why does it feel so heavy!" Hikel said. "Is this power coming from the creatures from the other world?" 

It was the opening of a portal, a portal to the other world; the only two people that seemed to be unaffected by the strange energy was Magnus and Quinn. 

"Haha, go ahead and kill me, but even if you do it won't change anything, those magic circles were to run ahead without me either way, even if I was dead or alive. The only thing we needed was for you to come here Quinn, and you did, you are the reason why Immortui will be able to come to this world!"

——

Up above in the spaceship, Agent 4 and Logan were looking at the yellow energy shining at the portal above.

"We planned for this to happen, are you still able to complete the task?" Logan asked. 

"I have made many preparations and have studied the magic circles from back then, and from the past of the vampires with your knowledge. I completely understand the language that is being used.

"We still have time, this is the same as last time. Although a portal has been opened, it's more of a crack than anything. Certain beings will be able to pass through, but those on the same level of strength as Immortui will not. At the moment he can not pass through."

"If we reverse it before then, the portal will close." 

When saying these words, Agent 4 was once again looking at Quinn. Logan could see this as well and it was clear that something was being kept from them. 

"We can't go down yet though, for me to reverse the magic circle, they will need to clear the area for me. I will not risk my life." Agent 4 stated.

——

Back on the ground, large amounts of power could be sensed leaking through the portal as it was slowly getting bigger. 

"Andy, Edvard, Hikel, I will trust the three of you to save Jessica and to deal with Magnus." Quinn said. 

Andy had gone against Magnus before so they knew he was strong, and this time he wasn't the only one that was in the way of them getting to Jessica, there were plenty of strong vampires as well, including a couple of Vampire Corps Chiefs that he recognised. 

"As long as we get rid of all the ones down here, then Agent 4 will be able to clear the area, was that not part of the plan?" Hikel asked. 

"You're right, but then who is going to deal with them coming through." Quinn looked up and a winged creature was floating about. It looked similar to Laxmus' celestial form, and it had just as much power as well. 

They would never be able to deal with such a creature. 

"I will deal with whatever comes through that portal, which is why I am trusting you." The shadow started to cover Quinn's body from head to toe, and as it slowly disappeared from the bottom, they could see that his armour was changing.
