Chapter 403 Lesson 001

Hearing the name of the first lessons that the group needed to attend sent all of their brains into a panic. They read out the words slowly, just in case they were not mistaken, but it definitely said, "How to consume blood."

‚ÄôDoes this mean, we might have to actually drink blood?‚Äô Cia thought as she gulped down.

Usually, the first day‚Äôs lesson consisted of ice breaking, the students getting to know each other. Or perhaps a friendly tour around the school. However, they quickly came to the realization that this wasn‚Äôt a normal school. So they wouldn‚Äôt be taking part in normal lessons here, such as Maths and English. More so than likely they would be learning about biology, learning a lot about the human biology.

After making everyone aware of what their lesson would be for the day, Silver went ahead and led the class to one of the school gyms. As they entered, the gym was fairly large and with only around twenty plus or so students it felt even bigger. Straight away though, the three of them noticed something spread out across the floor... something that almost made their stomachs churn.

If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that all they had eaten were Logan‚Äôs small little food pills, then perhaps they might have done.

lying there on the floor was something that could only be described as a human body. Equally spread across the floor were five bodies placed in a star shape. Seeing such things, the students got excited.

"Whoa, are they really human bodies?" Someone aksed.

"I‚Äôve never seen a human before? They look like us, right?‚Äô

"Don‚Äôt you think they look kinda the same. "

"You idiots, of course, that‚Äôs not a human body."

Heading to the centre of the gym, Silver picked up one of the bodies of the floor, with a small menacing glance towards the chatty students they immediately started to quieten down. "As some of you have already figured out, this is not a real human body. Our science department has been able to create a material that replicates the way the human flesh will react almost perfectly."

For a second, Logan thought that perhaps all the bodies they had seen in the glass container were also this so-called replicated flesh, but he quickly changed his mind. Quinn‚Äôs system had confirmed it so, and the wendigos surely would have been able to tell the difference. For even Logan could see there was a distinctive difference between the ones here and the ones in the glass container, and that was the smell.

Real human bodies rotted. The humans were also able to create a material that would replicate the skin and organs. Doctors often used it for training, but Logan never thought he would see one in a place like this, being used like this.

"The bodies have also been filled with a fake liquid that is the same consistency as blood." Silver continued to explain. "For obvious reasons, on the first day we have decided to avoid using real blood. We know some of you might not have as much control, or a strong will as others, and we wouldn‚Äôt be so cruel as to subject you to such things on your first day."

Some of the students looked a little nervous before and now felt a little relieved after she had said that. F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

"Many of you may never see a human in your lifetime, some of you will have jobs that make you interact with them. Still, we need to learn the proper way if an emergency was ever to happen, to extract blood from our victims and not to be found out. Does anybody know the best way to extract blood?" Silver asked as she looked at the crowd of people and eventually decided to point towards Vorden.

"Me,"

"Yes, you, Borden." Silver said.

Hearing that name, wanted to make Vorden hit himself, but right now he had to come up with a good answer.

"Erghh, your fangs?" Vorden replied, pointing to his mouth .

"I suppose I should have worded the question differently." Silver said. "Yes, the most efficient way to consume blood is using our fangs. They can easily pierce the skin while our saliva can be used to cover up the wound, but does anybody know the problem with that?"

She waited a few moments to see if anyone would raise their hand, but in the end, no one did.

"It‚Äôs granted you wouldn‚Äôt know, most of you consume blood form packs that are supplied to you by your family. When we bite into our victims using our teeth, a certain hormone is released that enters the human body. This gives them an incredible pleasure similar to as if one had taken a drug. One or two times is okay, but if you do this multiple times on a victim, then they will be seeking you out for more.

"You also have to be careful, as there are some people who are easily addicted. It might even just take one bite to have such an effect. So instead." Sliver then pulled out her hand and showed one finger, her nail then started to slightly extend into a sharp point, placing it on the dummy‚Äôs forearm she made a small cut, and the fake red blood-like liquid followed. After placing her finger in her mouth, she covered the wound, and it slowly started to heal.

"This will be the contents of today‚Äôs lesson. You must learn how to extend and harden your nail to easily perform a cut that can penetrate through a human‚Äôs skin. There are more things that you will need to learn in the future, of course, how to subdue a human without them noticing, how to clear their memories after. What are the negative effects and side effects to major memory loss, but for now it will just be this.

"These dummies are extremely hard, and the material is expensive to get. So we only have five of them. I want you all to quickly form groups of five and surround yourself around one of the dummies for practice. I will be coming around to give you tips and see how you do. Do you understand?"

"Yes!" the boys shouted, while the girls had answered in a more calm manner.

Groups started to quickly form, as most vampires decided to stay with people who were a part of the same family. Not everyone knew each other as the city was quite large, but most of them did due to their parents being part of the same family as well.

With the three of them, they only needed to find two more, but judging by the reaction of everyone, Vorden knew it was going to be a hard one.

"How are we going to do this?" Vorden mumbled

"We‚Äôre just going to be very bad at it." Logan replied, knowing he was asking about breaking the skin of the dummy. Instead of waiting around, he had already gone into recruiting mode, asking people if they wanted to join their group. But even the people that seemed to know no one didn‚Äôt want to join their group, even though everyone needed five people.

Looking around, Vorden spotted the other shy kid who also claimed he was from the tenth family. Just like them, it looked as if people were choosing to avoid him.

Seeing this, Vorden decided to approach him. "Do you want to come with usÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ Timmy, right?"

"Yeah, that would be great." Timmy said with a smile as he was overjoyed. Seeing this and how fragile and timid he looked, it reminded Vorden of when he had first met Peter.

As Logan came back to the group, he could see there was one more person, but he was sure he had asked everyone to join their group, but they had all declined.

"Well, they all said no." Logan said.

"It‚Äôs expected," Timmy replied. "After all, we‚Äôre tenths, probably no one, wants anything to do with us."

Vorden desperately wanted to ask Timmy what he meant by that, after all, it was the second time he had heard something like that, and it was clear the people were acting strangely towards them, but if he did ask it would also be obvious that he himself wasn‚Äôt part of the tenth family.

Fred and Snow were already in a full group together, but there were still a few strays looking to join a group, but they were refusing to go to the others. So much so that the strays were now asking if anyone was willing to swap with them.

"Hey, will any of you guys be willing to do a swap?" A boy asked.

"Sorry, man, we‚Äôre already a.."

"Yeah, I‚Äôll swap." Fred said, as he left Snow and the others and decided to head over to Vorden‚Äôs group

"Hey guys, I came to join you lot, I thought you were all pretty cool this morning, so I thought I would join you." Fred said with a smile. Finally, they had their group of five and it was time to pick a dummy, but as they all walked off to head towards the dummy closest, Cia remained there, still in her spot.

Hearing Silver say something had caused her to freeze in place, the words "memory loss" triggered something in her mind.‚ÄôVampires, they have the ability to remove memories...? Didn‚Äôt Layla say, we all used to be in a team together right, and Quinn.. he‚Äôs a vampire? Not just any vampire, a strong one as well. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it.. but is it possible, did he remove my memories..."
