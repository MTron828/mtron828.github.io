Chapter 533 Home sweet home Part 1

The introduction of the new vampire knight to the tenth family was a success. It looked like somehow, through some crazy methods they had actually managed to gain favour with the vampires.

News had already spread of what Leo had done and not just within the tenth family. As vampires returned to the pooling area, they started to interact with the other families telling them of the crazy story and announcement that had just seen play out.

Some of them just couldn’t believe what they were hearing. Even for vampires, it was a pretty crazy story to hear someone just chop off people’s arms like that, especially within their own family.

"Aren’t you a little worried?" A vampire asked.

"Worried, This is the best thing to happen to the tenth family in years!"

The other families didn’t understand what the tenth family was going through right now, but they were more than happy. Although, still with no leader, the situation would mostly be the same.

It was still better to try to get into one of the other families for a chance to learn their ability, giving themselves a better situation and a bright future. They just thought maybe staying wasn’t such a bad idea after all or as hopeless.

With the day coming to an end, it was time for everybody to rest up, but it was hard for some to fall asleep. This summer holiday had been eventful for all of them, to say the least. Some of them had gone through complete changes, no longing being human.

Others, like Logan, had discovered that their families had secrets kept to themselves and were involved in this whole mess more than they thought, and Vorden, he had gained a small brother out of the entire thing in the form of Borden.

They were all excited to finally leave the place, it felt strange and not one of them could call this place home. However, there were some people that they would miss.

Edward and Quinn were currently in discussions about something inside the throne room, as Quinn had made a proposal and written down a list for him. The list contained many different beast crystals that went form the basic tier, all the way up to the advanced tier level, but there was nothing above that.

"Whats this?" Edward asked.

"It’s a list of crystals that I want you to gather if you can. I’ve been thinking about how to help these people. How to make the tenth like the past again. I’m not like Vincent, I don’t have his ability, so I’m unable to create weapons as he could." Quinn explained.

"But, there is a load of weapons he left behind." Bringing up the system screen shop, Quinn was looking through them all. There were hundreds of different weapons and armour, most of them he didn’t need or would ever use.

It made him think, were they really all made for him in the first place?

According to Vincent, it was linked to the storage room in this castle that was locked behind a wall. As long as Quinn got the crystals required for the item, then it would transport the weapon from the storage room.

"If I get these crystals, I can get the weapons that Vincent left behind. I was thinking we could use them for the family. Those that do well, and show talent working hard, we give them an item.

"We don’t have an ability to incentivise them so I think this would be for the best."

"That’s a great idea!" Edward said, jumping out his seat. It really did feel like they would be going back to the golden days of the tenth family. "Just wait here, I think some of those beast crystals I can gather for you now."

Quinn was about to tell him to not bother and to do so when he got back, but Edward had already gone off somewhere with the trail of mist following him. It was the middle of the night and Quinn thought he would be able to get some rest for tomorrow, but it looked like he would be up all night.

’Ah, I probably wouldn’t have been able to get any sleep anyway.’ Quinn thought. A smile appeared on his face.

Edward had returned with a crate full of crystals and had crossed off some things from the list. Upon touching them all, Quinn started to create the items using the crystals one by one, and they really did seem to magically appear in his hands. They were all sorts of things. Although, according to Edward, not all of them would be useful for vampires.

He even said some of the items were worse then what they already currently have. This made sense since Vincent was an old vampire, and it was common for them to create some things better than he had at the time.

Still, Quinn would keep them in his inventory for now. Those items that Edward didn’t take he had another plan for them. There was a specific individual who he had teamed up with back on earth.

Finally, when everything was done, Quinn could get some good rest and was drained. Using the system like so didn’t use any energy but the repetitive task of using his system like so just took a toll on his mind. The sleep he thought he would never get, he did, as soon as his body had hit the bed he was out.

The next day he was woken up by Edward who seemed to have a box with him.

Quinn was still in his clothes as he was too tired to even get changed last night. Naturally, he looked out the window, and it was dark outside. He thought for a second it was still night time, but then remembered that it never changed on this planet.

After rubbing his eyes and getting off the bed, Quinn went over to Edward.

"What’s that?" Quinn asked.

"It’s the items that you ordered, they were delivered by a familiar this morning." Edward replied.

Opening the box, several different items could be seen. There were a few rings inside that he asked for, so he could give them to himself and others as well as spares. He never knew when they might need them, or what he would do if he lost them. And there were a few flasks as well.

The flasks were already filled with artificial blood, but there weren’t many of them. In the end, the only people that needed them were the vampires. It was a shame there wasn’t anything that could store fresh flesh for Peter when he needed it.

This is great. Quinn said. He put the rings in his dimensional void, but due to the blood being inside the flasks, he had to just keep that somewhere safe on him for now.

"And erm, it seems like the new guest is waiting in the Thorne room." Edward said.

As soon as he woke up, it seemed like Quinn wouldn’t even have a second to breathe before needing to do something else.

’Let’s get this over and done with and head back then." Quinn replied. "Ask everyone to meet up in the throne room when they’re ready. Tell them to pack their things and whatever they need, as if they aren’t coming back to this place."

After making sure his hair was okay, and his clothes weren’t wrinkled, Quinn was ready to meet this person.

’Knowing this person is from the first family, I just hope they won’t be a pain in my backside.’ Quinn thought.

He sighed as he pushed the doors open to enter the throne room, he walked across the red carpet from the doors and could see Dwight sitting down in his chair and a square device on the table next to him. It looked identical to the one Logan had, it was a teleporter.

When looking ahead though, Quinn finally met his eyes on his new guest, and it was quite a surprise indeed.

"Hi nice to meet you, the name’s Kazz." She said as she bowed down, and gave her hand for a shake.

Quinn didn’t even respond as he was stunned for a second. The first leader was a wrinkly old baldheaded man. He thought that maybe they would have sent some old uncle to look over him.

Instead, they had sent over a sweet looking... well Angel. Even now with her hand held out, she had her head slightly tilted and a cute smile on her face, which showed two dimples on her cheeks. Her hair was black in colour like most vampires, but she had them tied up into two little buns that looked like little bear ears.

On top of that, she looked to be the same age like everyone else.

’It’s a trick, right? It has to be a trick to let my guard down.’ Quinn thought.

"Did I do something wrong?" Kazz asked as she had her hand held out for a while, but Quinn still hadn’t shaken it.

Shaking his head, Quinn snapped out of it and shook her hand as well. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

"Nice to meet you." Quinn replied. "I guess we will be working with each other from now on."

"I look forward to it." She replied with her innocent smile once more.

People started to enter the room at that point and time, and Dwight was setting up the teleporter towards the end of the red carpet. It was time for them to head to their home sweet home.
