Chapter 2343 ¬†A lifeless world

Both Peter and Muka were on unfamiliar ground, the soil rather than black, was mystic, it was mostly purple in colour, but it sparkled like glitter while leaving all sorts of different colours. Just to make sure the floor was real, Muka bent down to pick it up while allowing it to fall to the floor like sand. ¬†When they looked up at the sky, they were able to see a mystic shifting of blue, green, and purple all mixed in together.

It was constantly moving and it was hard to see where the sky was or space since it all seemed to blend in together in one place.

And finally, there were the strange orbs of energy that were floating about, but there weren't many of them, at least not as many as the last time someone had visited such a place.

"Where are we?" Muka asked, touching her head, wondering if she was in a dream or under some type of hypnosis, but it all felt real and she remembered the last thing that had happened to them. "That portal, did it take us to another planet, another place?"

When looking at the landscapes off in the distance though, they somewhat felt familiar. The land, the trees, everything was different but it was almost as if the shapes were the same. She might have thought they were going crazy, but it almost looked exactly like the current vampire settlement. Not in terms of buildings and such, but the landmass.

"This‚Ä¶" Peter said. "Is the familiar world. We are nowhere near close to home."

A place that very few had ever travelled to, Muka couldn't believe that she was here, just because she was trying to keep an eye on Peter, and it looked like they weren't alone.

"You are right, it's been a while since we last saw you." A voice said.

Looking around, Muka was trying to find out where the voice had come from, that was until something small that was moving on the ground, started to grow until it was around the same size as them. Looking at it, she had to blink a few times to check what it was, but it was indeed a purple coloured turtle.

Another one of the four kings, Genbu. In the past, Muka had seen its power, as it was attached to the Graylash family. Genbu had done well not just during the Dalki war, but had also continued to help Owen during his reign of bringing vampires and humans together.

So much so, that there were even statues of Genbu on the Graylash planet. Many in the Graylash family would know of Genbu and honour him. The purple turtle with a great defensive and an almost impenetrable shell.

Portals by Genbu's side started to appear, similar to the ones that Muka and Peter had entered from, the Boneclaw, and Ovinnik had arrived, then through the third portal, a large horse, that had strange glowing light blue mist coming from its nostrils and where its hair would be.

Dunluck, the last of the four kings. The king had been used by Oscar, the former leader of the military. Although the two had only worked together after Oscar had changed into something else completely. The horse was said to have a strange strength and strange magical powers through its mist.

Here they all were, all of the rulers of the familiars were right there in front of them. Scattered around the land, there were also familiars in the background, aimlessly wandering, looking in their direction, but not acting from the far distance.

Gathering the energy in his fist Peter was ready to fight, but as the energy gathered around his fist, it acted differently than it would do from before. The energy was breaking off from his arm, bit by bit into the small balls.

However, Peter didn't care, he could still gather energy around his fist, and that was enough for him.

"Wait!" Muka shouted once again and latched herself onto his arm this time. She noticed her movements were slower than usual. She fetl like something was pulling on her stomach. The energy it was being drained from her here as well. "There has to be a reason, a reason why they decided to bring us to this place and meet us here."

"That is what happens in our world, did you forget?" Ovinnik stated. "The energy you call Qi, gets taken, and it's what we feed on."

Ovinnik opened his mouth wide, and ate the ball's of energy that were coming off from Peter. Soon, even being in this place was starting to effect Peter, and even more so since he was actively using up his energy, so he decided for once to do the sensible thing and listen.

'I need to make sure I can keep on pretending to be Quinn, for his sake. Otherwise it would trouble him, so I need to live.' Peter said to himself nodding.

"You are the ones that rule this place right?" Muka asked. "Then explain, why have the familiars started to attack the vampire settlement, and why‚Ä¶ why have they gone wild, and started to attack the vampires as well."

Genbu and Ovinnik looked at each other. Their expressions were hard to read. Ovinnik decided to hop onto the shell of Genbu, as he rested his fat belly and allowed his black tail to move in the wind.

"I guess I will be the one to do the talking, since I and Genbu here are really the only ones that can speak, but I want you to know, the attack on the vampire settlment, and the attack on the vampires themslves has been stopped. We can reassure you that the people are safe." Ovinnik explained.

Muka wanted to ask if that meant the attack had stopped completely, or was it a for now situation depending on how this conversation went, but she didn't want to stir up trouble.

"I heard what you said before." Muka said. "That it was a mistake, and you recognise Quinn, you said his name as if you didn't expect him to be here."

Ovinnik sighed as if it was bothersome explaining, which angered Peter, the energy was starting to rise in his fists again, how could the familiars be so calm about the situation, when they were the ones attacking and the leaders were right here in front of him.

"Calm down, this is a serious matter for us, I only yawned because we have hardly been able to rest, and do you think it was easy for us to all come to your world in the first place, or teleport you here? Do you have any idea how much energy we had to give to the Undead King!" Ovinnik shouted, and cleared his throat.

"You see, this world‚Ä¶ for a long time, it has always lacked the energy that we need to survive. The energy that we gather from contracts with those from another world. We fed off the life force that you gave us through contracts that we made. Doing so, would you, Qi. It's as if this whole universe, everything inside it is dying, and that includes us as well.

"The only way we were able to sustain ourselves, was by making contracts with those from another world. We fed off the life force that you gave us through contracts that we made. Doing so, would open up connections between the two worlds allowing more energy to seep through.

"This is how the familiar world has continued to exist and why we continued to form contracts. Of course, our characters remained unchanged, which is why many of us were picky, but the natural energy in our world is leaving. √öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

"Just look up, you can see that there isn't much energy left. To put it simply, we had no choice, our world is dying‚Ä¶"

Everything made sense so far as to why they would make the contracts. However, why attack the vampire settlement and what about everything else?

"I can see I haven't answered all your questions, but it is important that I tell you everything, everything that has led us up to the current actions that we had decided to take‚Ä¶. and the mistake that we realised that we might have made when we saw that you were here Quinn."

Muka gulped, it looked like the leaders had mistaken the disguised Peter as Quinn, and she was wondering when they found out the truth, if it would affect what they were about to say, but the best thing they could do was listen.

"I'm listening‚Ä¶ tell us, what happened to the familiars." Muka asked.

"Everything was a plan‚Ä¶ a plan that we had set up, when we had agreed to form a contract with the one named Erin Heley."
