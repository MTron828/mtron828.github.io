 At close range, Quinn had shot out a dark coloured blood aura directly at Kronker, it had smashed him in the chest throwing him to the ground. The blast was so large it had covered his whole body and one was unable to even see a single part of Kronker. 

This blast wasn't just any blast, as it had even used Kronker's own blood in the attack. It was clear that this attack was stronger than the blasts that had come from Quinn before. 

While the stream of energy continued to burst out from Quinn's mouth,  something else was happening. From his blood wings, small orbs looked to be dripping off. They were floating in the air just beneath. Droplets of blood from the wings were forming into something the same size as a football. 

When the blood ball had been fully formed, it moved, heading straight for where Kronker was. It crashed into the ground, causing a large explosion of power that reached up to the skies like a nuclear explosion. 

A powerful shockwave was sent out in all directions once again, punishing even the power that was mixed into the air. 

"If you want to live, then get behind me!" Calva shouted to the other Skullys. 

It didn't take them much convincing as they could see the shockwave coming towards them, and rather than just a blast this seemed to have some remnants of energy with it. 

Calva's body started to glow white, and just as the shockwave was about to hit them, the energy from his body exploded, allowing for the dark red energy to be pushed to the side of them. 

The Skullys had braced themselves, covering their eyes and their faces, and when they realised they were still alive, they could see that much of the thick forest that was claimed to be indestructible was getting destroyed bit by bit. 

Roots, large tree trunks and branches were being destroyed by this fight. That wasn't the only large explosion either, as the blood balls were continuing to be created from Quinn's wings, and each time they would be thrown down to Kronker's position creating an equally powerful explosion. 

After around six large explosions, the blood balls as well as the blasts from Quinn's mouth had stopped as he went ahead and fell to the ground.

"The demon king, there's no way he survived that right?" Anon said. "He… has to be dead."

"The demon kings are demon kings for a reason, so I wouldn't count on it." Ekeke replied. 

Just as Ekeke said, emerging from the deep crater that had been made, where one would unlikely be able to see even the bottom, a hand reached out from the crack, and pulled itself up. 

Kronker had crawled out, but he didn't look to be okay at all. Parts of the skin on his body looked as if the flesh had been torn off and the inner parts of his flesh could be seen, but the most damage that had been done to him was his arm. 

His right side had completely disappeared from his shoulder, there was nothing there onwards. His aura seemed to still be active surrounding the wound, stopping it from bleeding, and even with his image his aura still seemed to be just as strong. 

"Hahah!" Kronker laughed. "Do you think that could kill me? You must have used up a lot of energy in that last attack, and I can see you still have no idea how to use the energy around you." 

Kronker opened up his mouth wide and the energy from the air around that had moved out of the way, started to come towards him, and towards his mouth. It soon entered and the aura was shining more vibrant than before, but his arm was still missing. 

"A demon king can fight forever!" Kronker shouted, as he charged forward. 

Aura attacks and blasts weren't working, so he would have to do something else, and fight directly instead. With his tentacles on his back, he practically had two additional limbs and in this form he was incredibly fast and powerful. Although he now only had three limbs.

Throwing out his left arm that was still intact, he attempted to hit the demon Quinn. His hand was hitting nothing but air, as a smile was still on Quinn's face avoiding each of the hits. 

The tentacles were also being used trying to get a decisive and killer blow on Quinn, but he just continued to avoid them all. As a large strike came, with his wing, Quinn had whacked the arm away.

Then with his own clawed arm, he swung down right at the shoulder. Kronker looked to his left and he could see, in that moment, his other arm being detached from his body. 

'How… how can he slice through my arm so easily… This makes no sense. Although my body is no longer made of the red crystals, the trait of the Durum's in my demon form, my current skin is actually around ten times harder. It's an evolved form of the crystal. 

'Crystals, hard and flexible like skin all over my body, and he can break through it with ease… what type of demon is this!'

Right after his other arm had been sliced off, a fist was felt grabbing the back of his head, while another hand slammed him right in the stomach. Blood gushed out from Kronker's mouth, but rather than falling to the floor, it had gathered in the palm of Quinn's hand. I think you should take a look at

With just a single hand on Kronker's head, he moved behind him, and lifted his entire body from the back, slamming it into the ground where they were. Cracks formed and pieces of the land lifted up in the sky from the sheer strength that had been used, and fell back down onto the ground. 

With the blood ball in Quinn's hand, he then threw it down right at Kronker's chest, creating another large explosion. It hurt deep, the power spread through Kronker, and although his body was still intact, he wasn't sure how much energy he had left. 

When the energy and the dust started to settle, Kronker could feel a foot on his chest. It was Quinn's foot, and the crazed smile with the red eyes was looking at his face. 

It had come to this, the demon king felt like he was on his last legs, it had been a long time since he felt this way, but at that time he had admitted defeat and had decided to work for Immortui. 

There was a big difference between the two losses though, with Immortui, there was a greater fear in his defeat. 

'If I am going to die, then I might as well take you with me.' Kronker thought. 

All of the energy from within, all of the aura from around his body and the outside air started to gather where his spikes were, between his eyebrows. Sparks of power were forming a ball of energy near his head. 

It was a final attack, after this he would have nothing left to give, so if this didn't defeat Quinn, then the fight was over. When one person had nothing to lose, they would often be more dangerous and this was true for Kronker's situation.

"DIE!" Kronker shouted, as the energy was unleashed. 

Seeing this though, the black markings on Quinn's chest and under his eyes, started to glow. The cloak that was seemingly attached to his body all started to move towards his right hand making it slightly bigger in size. 

With it, Quinn grabbed the energy blast before it could get larger, he was holding it as it pushed against his arm. 

"This is… impossible!" Kronker thought. 

With his right hand, Quinn continued to push the energy blast down. He was pushing it and pushing it, until the energy blast had stopped coming from Kronker, and now it was left just in Quinn's hand as a ball of energy. 

"Hahah!" Quinn laughed with the deep and high pitched sound, as he used his right hand, and slammed the ball of energy right into Kronker's head. 

It pushed in, disintegrating his teeth, while the sheer strength of Quinn's hand and the ball of energy allowed for his hand to completely crush and go right through Kronker's skull. 

There was now a large hole in the demon king's head, with nothing but his horns and ears showing, it was clear the demon king had been defeated and there was no coming back from it.

"The demon king of the Durum's is dead…" Anon said in disbelief. 

The other Skullys were moving from behind Calva to take a better look and they could see it was true. 

Quinn stood up, above Kronker's body, it was unmoving and there was no more of his energy swirling around in the area. For Calva he had a big worry on his mind now. What was going to happen now… because Quinn was still in his demon form.
