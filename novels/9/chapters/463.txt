464 The last day

The suggestion by Cia that had been made was quite honestly one Quinn never thought about. He had always seen Cia as an outsider, even before all of this happened. Unlike the others, she hadn‚Äôt known his secret and kept it hidden amongst them. So there was no bond, no time spent together, and she was right, there was no trust. ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

In fact, he was the only one that didn‚Äôt even want Cia on this trip in the first place, but he had to admit the suggestion itself that was made wasn‚Äôt a bad one. However, the main reason why he was thinking this was a selfish one.

Quinn was busy thinking about his quest, the quest to become a leader. Most likely completing that quest would come with several rewards, and one of them was to have ten people in the Cursed family. So far, there was Layla, Peter and Leo, which was 3/10. Honestly, to complete this quest, he didn‚Äôt know who he would turn as there were a few downsides into turning people.

The first was not knowing what they would turn into. There were many different options, and some had major downsides such as Peter turning into a ghoul. The second reason was the loss of ability, and this was why he had never even thought about making the suggestion to both Logan and Vorden. Their abilities were strong and useful. More times then one if they didn‚Äôt have them, they would have been dead by now.

And even Layla was yet to find a new ability for herself after losing the last one.

The important thing before any of this was, could he even return her memories?

"System, is there a way for Cia to have her memories returned?" Quinn asked.

"Through an action of yourself or through her own actions, it is indeed an impossible task." The system replied. "But it is not impossible. One of the leader‚Äôs vampire abilities might be able to help you see, but I‚Äôm not sure if the ability remains the same, or if she is still the leader. At the same time, I very much doubt they would ever help a human."

It sounded like a long and complicated process and nearly impossible. They were just about to go against the whole vampires‚Äô structure and community, and that included the leaders. After these events, if they made it out alive, Quinn very much doubted that any of the leaders would be willing to help them.

Looking at Cia‚Äôs face, Quinn was at a mix of what to tell her. Maybe the systems way wasn‚Äôt the only way, and her memories could return eventually. This way, he would also have a strong ally.

"I‚Äôll think about it. It isn‚Äôt a no, but it isn‚Äôt a yes. I promise I‚Äôll let you know by the end of the day." Quinn said, as he knew he needed to make a decision quite fast.

"Thank you." Cia politely replied as she went away with Layla.

There were more than enough rooms in the castle for everyone to get a good nights sleep. But before they could enjoy the nice relaxing comfy soft beds. They were all busy doing their own things. Quinn and Peter were busy training away in the reception area.

With Edward gone, they felt like it was possible that there could be vampires on the outside keeping an eye on them, and for now, the safest place was the castle. Where the only people who knew the combination to the circle lock, were Peter, Quinn and Edward himself.

As for the two girls, Layla tried to fill her in with more detail about what had happened in her past, including things about Pure.

Timmy, he was worried about Edward, wondering why he hadn‚Äôt come back yet. "What will I do?" Timmy thought. He didn‚Äôt really know the others well, and although he had agreed to follow the tenth, what they were planning to do, it was too much of a big step for him.

Quinn had told Timmy, he didn‚Äôt expect him to do anything. Just telling them where to go, and being their guide was helpful enough.

He looked at the book in his hands that was given by Edward. For once he had the chance to gain power, to be stronger than some of the other vampires. What was the point if he had this power, who was he getting stronger for? For the other vampire leaders?

Still, undecided with what he would do, Timmy knew he wouldn‚Äôt waste this opportunity and opened the book. He wouldn‚Äôt waste the gift and learn the ability given by Edward.

The ones that were busiest though was Logan, and the two boys. Having taken a blood sample from Borden, he was trying to see if the details matched up with the green liquid he had created. It wouldn‚Äôt take long for him to find out the results, and after a short while, he had his answer.

"It was me...I somehow gave the information that was needed to create the Dalki." Logan thought.

It wasn‚Äôt just a small match, but a complete match. It was clear in Logan‚Äôs mind, that the information he had inputted into the machine was shared somewhere and it led to the creaion of the Dalki.

The question was why? Why was the machine set up in the tenths castle this way? Quinn‚Äôs system had an Ai that was created by the tenth leader. The tenths leader had a lab that shared information from the sound of it to the original lab they first arrived at that belonged to Richard eno.

Where the tenth leader and Richard Eno somehow related, were they doing experiments on vampires, Dalki‚Äôs and humans. Or was the Dalki a complete manmade creation, perhaps a vampire creation would be the more accurate term.

It was clear though, somehow the tenth leader was involved in Richard Eno, they could even possibly be the same person. So many theories were running through Logan‚Äôs head, and he didn‚Äôt have all the answers.

He wanted to talk to Quinn about it but now was not the right time. He had too much on his plate with the rescue mission. But as long as the rescue mission was a success and they were able to get out of here alive. Then Logan and Quinn needed to have a serious talk.

Not wanting to scare the other two, Logan moved on to look at the pills and Blood crystals. While doing this, Vorden was busy talking away to Borden. The two of them seemed to be getting on quite well, and Vorden was telling him everything that had happened at school.

How he had met Quinn and what they were doing here so far, how they were here to rescue a friend.

"Wow, it sounds like you have been through a lot," Borden said. "Well, a friend of my brother is a friend of mine. If you need any help, I‚Äôll take them out with this fist of mine." Flexing his muscle, which incredibly bulged in a matter of seconds. It had become so lean it looked like there wasn‚Äôt an ounce of fat on him.

"But I have to ask?" Borden said. "This whole time you have talked about, Quinn, your friends and the others, but what about you. I want to know more about you. Don‚Äôt you have a family or a past?"

Hearing this question, it had been a while since anyone had asked him about his family. It was a subject that he would avoid at all cost.

"That situation... is probably even more complicated than the one we are in now. Maybe one day, it will be resolved as well. I hope I can forget about all that and just continue hanging out with everybody like we are doing now.

"I know it sounds stupid, what we‚Äôre doing is incredibly dangerous, but... I just like being with everyone." Vorden said with a smile on his face.

"When you are ready, you can tell me brother, and I will help you with that too," Borden replied.

After looking at the pills and getting as much information as he could, it was getting late, and Logan‚Äôs eyelids were feeling heavy. They felt like it was time to call it a night. He could find out information about the blood crystal tomorrow.

Before going to sleep, Quinn decided to stop by and have a talk with the girls, and he was ready to give his answer.

‚Äô"I‚Äôm sorry, but right now, I can‚Äôt turn you into a vampire." Quinn said. "First, I promise that I will look for a way to return your memories and I think what you proposed is a fair deal. But its too risky right now to turn you. We don‚Äôt have time to figure out or deal with another problem if one does happen.

"On top of that, your ability is incredibly handy, especially for Vorden. I think as you are right now its best to stay the way you are. As I said, I think we have a deal, but let‚Äôs do it after tomorrow."

Cia couldn‚Äôt really complain about the response, as it was exactly what she asked for. Maybe it would take a little while longer, but she knew they would have to deal with the current situation anyway.

After a good nights rest, everyone continued to do the same as they had done yesterday. Everyone was kind of doing their own thing, but when all was said and done, once again they were to all meet in the dining room.

"As Edward hasn‚Äôt returned, it looks like we will have to do this without him," Quinn said. "It‚Äôs finally time, the execution is tomorrow."
