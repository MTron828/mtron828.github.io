Before Muka and Peter explained further, since this seemed to be a big reveal of information, they had decided to get Logan in on the conversation, he was called and holgrammed into one of the empty seats.

All of them had been trying to reach Quinn with no such results, so they wondered just how they were able to figure it out. 

"While you were all away there was an attack on the vampire settlement." Muka explained. "That attack was done by the familiars. We have quite a bit to explain, but now Peter has a contract with all 4 of the familiar kings."

This news was something the other originals weren't even aware of. They had only recently learned that the one that they were following so far was really Peter, which was a relief for them all, because things started to make sense, considering his recent actions in the vampire settlement.

"Let me explain from the beginning…" 

Muka went on to explain what exactly had occurred at the vampire settlement, and what had happened with Peter's meeting with the others. She also went on to even explain the finer details such as the 4 king's believing that they were making a deal with Quinn himself. 

When the others learned of this situation, there were a few shaken heads and open mouths. It was a risky move, but they knew that it had to have worked out in the end, otherwise they wouldn't be here right now. 

Then finally went onto the last details that the Boneclaw, the undead king, had the ability to open up a portal to the same world where Immortui belonged.

"This is quite the achievement." Logan was the first to speak. "At the moment we don't know if Quinn is stuck in the other world. So even if we found a way to open a portal there, we were struggling with how to open one back from the other side. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"However, if the Boneclaw is able to create portals himself, then we should be able to get in and out, as long as the Boneclaw is capable of doing that." 

One of the markings on Peter's hand started to light up, and when it did a fat cat appeared out of it. It was one of the four king's Ovinnik.

"The undead king is capable of that, but opening up a portal to another world requires a lot of energy." Ovinnik explained. "You see, he already used a lot of energy that was gathered in the attack. I would say right now, he only has enough energy to open a portal to get you in.

"So you would still have the problem of returning. However, I do believe that the Qi that is in Quinn is incredibly strong. If you find him, then he might be able to give enough energy to open up a portal for you to get back, but there are no guarantees."

The group had a choice to make, now that they had a way to enter, whether they were to do so or not, and they could see from the eager look on Layla's face that she was ready to go through to that hell right now.

"Everyone needs to think clearly with their heads." Logan said, speaking through his holographic self. "I know all of you wish to go help Quinn, but will going to the other side really help him that much?"

"We have to think about the information we have, Magnus, Zero, Laxmus, all three of these were dedicated followers of Immortui. They had his borrowed power and each one of them was incredibly strong, causing us huge amounts of trouble.

"Now think for a moment about those that Quinn dealt with. Their power was stronger or at least equal to them, and there is a chance in that world that there are those stronger than them. 

"I will be the first to admit that if I was to head into the other world in order to help Quinn, I wouldn't be able to do much at all, I am too weak."

The others understood what Logan was saying, especially those that had faced the ones he had mentioned. Could they imagine a world with beings like that, with those that are perhaps stronger, but for some it was even more reason for them to go then, because it meant Quinn was facing all of these on his own. 

"Ha!" Peter laughed out loud, breaking the silence. "You guys can speak for yourselves, but I am plenty strong, and with these kings giving me a very very small amount of assistance, it will give me even more power. All we need to do is gather those that are strong enough and that can enter the other world. 

"And not to be a downer or anything, but Layla I don't think you're strong enough." 

A large vein appeared on the side of Layla's forehead as she heard this, and she stood up from her seat. 

"What are you saying, do you really want to go toe to toe now, I have survived this long haven't I!" Layla shouted. I think you should take a look at

"Yeah, and that's only because Quinn has love eyes for you. Think, without him, do you think you would have survived this long, whereas for me, I have saved his life multiple times."

The tension was heating up between the two, and the originals thought that they might see a big battle right in front of them. Stepping in the middle of the two of them, in the end, was Muka. 

"We have to face the truth." Muka said. "Honestly from what we know, and from what Edvard and the others had told us, not even they were a match for Magnus on his own, which means it would be the same for me. 

"Also, you have to think about your children. If you were to leave, who would look after them? Of course, I know you have no intention of dying, but there is the real chance that you might not be able to return, all of those that are going need to know that."

At that moment and time, Layla hated herself, she hated herself for being so weak, and being unable to catch up to Quinn to help him out. She was his partner and she was meant to be there with him through thick and thin. 

She even had been progressing for a 1000 years while Quinn was in a deep slumber all to catch up to him and yet here she was falling behind.

"I understand… I thought with the sword, I might be of some help… but what you say is true."

"I have a solution for you all." Logan said. "While all of you were bickering, I gathered information of those who have the highest chance of survival and might be considered the strongest to go over to the other side."

In front of them all, the first image to appear was none other than Sil. 

"We know Sil's strength possibly equals that of Quinn himself and with his high range use of abilities he is able to adapt to any situation." 

The screen changed and this time, a muscular scared figure appread on the screen, but it was one they knew well. 

"We have Chris, or Agent 1 as some used to refer to him as. He has incredible use of Qi, a strong body and has the DNA of a Werewolf. Combining all these factors as well as his chance to continue to grow and his stable strong body, he will be able to have a fighting chance."

The screen changed again, and this time it had a red scaled figure on the screen.

"I'm sure we all know the frightening power of Ray, at this moment and time, we are unaware of his location, but I would say he is one of the few that has a chance to even go head to head with Immortui."

So far they all thought that those that were going were incredibly strong, Edvard and Hikel, they too wanted to go, and wondered if there was something they could do. 

The screen changed once again revealing the last person. 

"Finally we have Russ, due to his power and connecting with the sword he was able to defeat Pine, one of the most difficult Dalki we have had to deal with. We are unsure if he would be willing to help us though. However, with these people if we can gather them all, then we have a chance of going against Immortui."
