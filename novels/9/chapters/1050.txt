Chapter 1051 - A diffrent skill?

After defeating the Demi-god tier beast, the sound of battle inside the Shelter was still ongoing. Those from the Graylash family stationed on the wall turned around and started to direct their lightning strikes towards the beasts inside the Shelter. While two of them jumped down to aid their Head General.

"Is everything okay sir?" They said as they helped lift him off the ground by his arms. Even with the beast dead, he was still feeling the fur’s effect on him. Some time would be needed before his MC cells would make complete recovery as well, but gritting his teeth, and through sheer will, once he was helped to his feet not wasting time, Robin ran through the gates with the others.

Sil had decided to do the same, heading back in. Although his concern wasn’t for the people inside the Shelter, he wondered what was so urgent that made Quinn leave so suddenly like that.

That left all the men who had fallen asleep or perished along with Ko outside the gates.

’How could they just leave my people like this? What if more beasts start to come from the north forest? All the people will die.’ Ko thought, but his eyes weren’t looking at his men. Instead, they were locked onto the Demi-god tier beast that had perished.

Walking over to the beast, Ko took out his sword and started carving away.

’Who could be so foolish to leave such a thing behind.’ Ko thought.

"This is strange," Linda said, now in her smaller form. Her larger self consumed too much power. If she needed to recharge it, there was only one option, which she wasn’t exactly pleased about doing.

"Are you talking about the beasts?" Wevil replied, as he too had gone out of his transformed stage and continued to slash at the creatures coming towards him. They were mainly bug like creatures from the looks of it, but were roughly the size of a basketball.

"Yeah, usually different types of beasts don’t coordinate an attack like this. It’s as if something is making them stay here."

As they continued to fight, eventually the beasts started to change their course of action. It was like a switch inside them. Now nearly all the beasts were attempting to escape from the place. While their backs were turned, the angry Travellers made sure to make them pay and attempted to kill as many of them as possible.

Eventually, when all of the beasts including the ones above had left the area, the sound of fighting and crying started to calm down and the fighting had stopped.

"The beasts have retreated!" A large man shouted, raising his battle axe.

Soon after, everyone in the faction cheered and shouted as a sign of relief. The Cursed members had all gathered to see if each of them were okay, and other than being exhausted and a few scratches here and there they seemed to be fine.

"When they said that the beasts attacked this shelter frequently, I never expected something like that." Layla said, putting her weapon away.

"I don’t think that was a normal attack." Linda replied, looking at the condition of the Shelter buildings. They were crumbled and destroyed. It was clear that the last attack wasn’t on the same level. This much destruction would take a while to repair without many earth users.

Entering the place, Robin could see that he didn’t need to do much. He had used the last of his strength to zap a few creatures but soon found them retreating. At the same time, Ko had entered and a few of the Travellers that were standing by the gate, he ordered them to bring the others inside.

He looked at all the destruction around and the blood that had been split, and then his eyes went towards the Cursed faction in the centre.

’Did they fight? Or did they run away like their leader?’ Ko thought, not seeing Quinn anywhere. ’They hardly have any scratches on them.’

Ko didn’t realise that he had hardly been hurt either, since his only part in the fight was being a distraction, but he had a lot of black blood on his armour making it look like he had fought many beasts.

Walking over, Ko was ready to give the group an earful. He was going to complain about them not helping while also asking where their so-called leader was, but eventually Travelers and civilians started to surround them.

"Thank you, thank you so much for helping us. You lifted that rubble off of us."

"Thank you for helping at the gate as well. If it wasn’t for you guys more of the beasts would have got in."

"You were amazing, I never knew the Cursed faction had such strong members. Having you guys it felt like we had a hundred extra people helping us."

Ko could hear it all, for some reason. Not just the civilians but even members of his own faction were praising them for what they had done.

’So they come in, and protect us from one attack and they get treated like gods?’ Ko thought. ’What about me, me who has been protecting this place all on my own since the beginning. When the Graylash and the Cursed weren’t here.’ His fists were shaking. ’Where the hell is my praise you ungrateful brats. I was the one who made the Orbus faction and even stationed our base here, protecting all of the Travellers and people!’

’At least, I got some reward out of this damned attack.’ Ko said, touching the side of his pouch.

In the forest, Quinn had just defeated the Demi-god tier beast, and his health was still being affected by the purple fur, that was until he had received the quest rewards from finishing off the beast in the requested time limit.

[Instant level up received]

[You are now level 63]

Since Quinn was at such a high level now, killing beast hardly put a dent in levelling up his exp, so he had to rely on the system granting him special quests like this one, or a force that was so strong that he could level up from.

With the stat point, he had placed it into his stamina stat, finally getting it up to seventy with the rest of his stats.

He was happy that he had received an instant level up, because even though he had defeated the Demi-god tier beast quickly, he wasn’t sure if he could have done it within the five minute time frame without the new armour set. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

’Did the system know what equipment I have? Arghh I’m treating this thing too much like a human. Still, the system does seem to be quite clever, at times.’ Quinn thought.

However, the reason why Quinn’s health stopped going down after the fight, was because of the next reward, for the first time ever, he had received a passive skill.

[Passive skill unlocked - Immunity to poison]

[This skill is unable to be levelled up. The user will be immune to all types and kinds of different poison]

Now he understood why after completing the quest even though the purple fur was still floating about in the area, he was now no longer being affected.

’A passive skill. I’ve never heard of a vampire even having such things.’ Vincent said, sounding genuinely shocked rather than his usual sarcastic self. ’I wonder how far the system can go?’

Quinn was wondering the same thing, he even wondered what it meant to be immune to all poisons, would this also include the fairy blood that was poisonous to vampires, or was that counted as a different substance?

Nonetheless, it certainly was a handy thing to have. There were poison ability users out there, and many strong foes unstoppable in fights had fallen to poison.

’The real question is what to do with this.’ Quinn said as he held the Demi-god tier crystal in his hand. Right now, he had half of the answer to solving part of Sil’s problem. However, there were two Demi-god tier beasts that had attacked, and he was wondering how willing the others would really be letting him keep such a thing, or even having both.

’This area is pretty far out from the Shelter, and it looks like the fur is slowly starting to fade away. I just need to move the body deeper for the beasts to come and get rid of it for me. What they don’t know won’t hurt them, and maybe this will give us more of a chance to get the other Demi-god tier crystal.

’Which means the demon crystal can be used to be turned into a weapon. I can feel it, the fighting has stopped inside the Shelter, so I still have time. Looks like things are going our way after all.’ Quinn thought.

At the same time, the Graylash members had gone to check up on the other demi-god tier beast. They could see that several cuts had already been made on the beast, and when they searched, they couldn’t find the crystal at all.

"Where is the Crystal? Did another beast take it?" A Graylash member said.

"No, can’t you see? It looks like the beast has already been carved. Which means it’s already been taken by somebody." Another replied.
