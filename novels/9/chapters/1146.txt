Chapter 1147 Giant Robots

Just to make sure he had heard correctly, Quinn played the recording back a couple of times. The voice was distinct, deep dark and a bit heavy. It was as if the one speaking wasn’t quite used to the act. In a way it sounded similar to the way the Dalki would speak, yet this voice had a different tone to it.

’Is this a recording of the Demi-god tier beast?’ Quinn wondered. It was the only thing he could guess since he was still unable to access files or any information on the terminals, nor did he have much experience with the higher tier beasts.

After all, it wasn’t that long ago that he became able to defeat them and that kind of information should only be spread among those that had already reached such a level. Still, he had once heard about a Demon tier humanoid beast that had been capable of speaking the human language. Quinn might not have believed such a thing, if the one who had told him wouldn’t have been Oscar.

’If a humanoid Demon tier beast is able to communicate, then it might be safe to assume that an evolving Demi-god tier beast can do the same.’ Quinn justified the recording. ’But what about that message? It sounds like we are the bad guys here.’

Beasts were known as aggressive beings. They would attack anyone who would enter their territory, be they fellow beast or human. However, this one sounded sad and angry at the loss of its fellow beasts. What’s even more interesting was that it hadn’t outright attacked them, but had apparently given the Earthborn group an ultimatum.

’Are humanoid beasts that different due to their intelligence? It wasn’t just worrying about the other beasts, but about this planet as a whole.’ Thinking back at what Colonel Longblade had said, he mentioned that the Demi-god tier beast would come and go, destroying the Mechs and equipment. It didn’t outright kill humans and even the beasts it hunted had been killed in one fell swoop.

Could it be that it was its version of kindness?

It was certainly something for Quinn to think about. He then spent some more time watching the Basic tier go through its evolution process, before Quinn decided it was time to finally leave the place. He was sure today wouldn’t be the last time he would come visit this lab either. Only next time, he might bring Logan along.

Getting out of the building was no problem at all thanks to Shadow travel. The ability allowed him to pass through walls. He had followed the beast in the cage to find out where exactly it was going in the first place. Once out of the building with Shadow cloak he could go back to the sleeping quarters without them ever realising he was gone.

"Was there any trouble?" Quinn asked, as he appeared behind Fex.

"Damn it, wh-!" Fex was about to shout as jumped up from his position, but Quinn had barely covered the other’s mouth. He only removed it once his friend had seemingly calmed down, realising who he was.

"Did you have to sneak up on me like that?" Fex angrily asked.

"I was sure you would have sensed me coming." Quinn explained, since even some humans could detect him when using Shadow cloak, much less a vampire of Fex’ caliber.

"Yeah, well I’m tired. The air here is horrible and our roommates aren’t much better. There were a couple of guys who kept on coming over, pretending to have some business here. In the end I got pissed and used my Influence skill to make them stop. Don’t worry, it doesn’t seem like they’ve noticed anything, but unless we teach them a lesson or two, more will come to bother us."

"Are you sure, we can’t just give one of them a crude beating, set it as an example to not mess with us. That’s how a vampire would do it?’ Fex suggested.

"That might be the vampire way, but we aren’t in the Vampire World, now are we? I don’t want to rule these people through fear. The people are divided, because we dropped a bomb on them. It might be inconvenient for us, but we need to earn their trust again and beating up some random nobodies won’t really help us with that." Quinn disagreed. Fex didn’t look quite convinced, but at least Quinn was sure the other vampire wouldn’t look for trouble either.

The next morning the sun rose, and the first thing the soldiers did once they woke up was to check their necks. Each one was loudly announcing that they were ’safe’. What’s more they even did a headcount to check if any of them had gone missing. Of course this was all due to the new visitors there. When they looked over at them, Fex who had already been annoyed couldn’t help but shout: "I might be hungry, but I still have STANDARDS!"

This resulted in some strong gazes, but ultimately nothing else came of it. They started to leave the area and do their own thing while the Cursed group could do nothing but wait. Quinn informed Logan about the lab and told him that he should come along, but the best time would be at night fall again.

With nothing else to do, their group walked around together and they were quickly drawn to the sound of loud cheers coming from a certain place. Loud bangs followed and the sound of something heavy was heard crashing to the floor.

Breaking off from the group, Fex was the first to run around the corner, searching for the origin, and the next moment he stood there with his eyes lighting up and shining stars.

"Hey, there’s a freaking giant robot fight happening here! Come on!" Fex enthusiastically shouted. There were just some things that a vampire couldn’t experience in the Vampire World, and this was one of them.

When the group caught up to Fex they could see it as well. It was a repeat of what they had seen from above in the ship. However now they were closer they could see things that they hadn’t been able to before.

There were makeshift stands where the soldiers stood and cheered for the fighters. It looked like it had been made via the Earth ability, but then in the centre, there was terrain unlike anything on the planet itself.

A large square field the same size as a soccer field was present, yet there was a strange forest in place there. That was the arena for the fight. They would use the trees for cover while firing at each other, dashing and running through, then when they were within close range, all the Mechs seemed to be equipped with a giant sword.

"Wait, what’s with those capsules at the end, don’t they look like the VR capsules?" Layla pointed out. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

At either end of the giant battle there were two pods stationed, and they looked exactly like the one Quinn would often use to play power fighters.

"That’s because they are." Logan clarified. "What you’re looking at right now is an augmented reality field. The terrain they are fighting on, the Mechs themselves, it’s all generated by holograms. Even the sounds and the vibration you are feeling are simulated."

"There are two people in the VR capsules who are controlling the Mechs. It also allows them to train and practice in as many different terrains as they wish."

"How do you know all of this?" Fex asked.

"Because my company is the one that sells these products and I was the one who helped develop them. It’s expensive to use actual Mechs in combat. Could you imagine how much that would cost? This is the perfect way for them to experience all the different types of terrain outside the live situation."

"The added benefit is not every person has to be in the VR capsule to watch or experience what is going on, they can all watch, coach and give each other tips on the go. It’s too expensive for consumer use, so it’s no wonder we haven’t seen one until now. " Logan explained.

Entering the crowd, the Cursed group were interested in getting a closer look. They were allowed through and as they walked through the stands it didn’t come as a surprise when people started to notice them.

The cheering turned to stares and grunts, as they whispered hoping that they wouldn’t choose a seat next to theirs.

"Let’s just stand by the railing." Quinn suggested, as they went to the seats that were closest to the area where the show was going on, and were able to just stand and watch.

As they were watching Fex started to imitate the robots, as he imagined polishing one of the things, and the others around found it quite hilarious as they giggled.

"He’s like a child, has he never piloted one of those things before?"

"I doubt the V have such advanced techs as mechs? And the Cursed probably don’t train there now in things like this." Another said.

Although Fex chose to ignore it and started to root for one of the other members.

"What are you doing, you should dodge to the left, and then slice that other one in half."

Fex’s comments were starting to annoy some of the nearby soldiers, as it sounded like he could have done a better job and in the end, the one Fex was rooting for along with many others in the crowd had lost.

"What the hell was that guy doing!" Fex complained with his hands held over his head.

"Shut your mouth you brat!" One of the soldiers shouted. "I don’t think you have any idea how to even pilot one of those things! You would lose to any one of us, so unless you want to put your words into action then zip it!"

Quinn didn’t like the way this person was speaking to one of his friends. His anger was boiling at this moment, but Fex’s reaction was unexpected.

"You mean you’ll really let me pilot one of these?!" Fex asked with a giant grin.

———

They didn’t know how, but somehow Fex got pushed to the front of the waiting participants and was ready to head into the VR capsule to have his first match.

"Do you think he’ll be okay?" Layla asked.

"I have no idea." Quinn shrugged his shoulders.

The ones in the crowd were cheering as they recognised the person standing next to the other VR capsule. It was Avion Bon, the best Mech pilot they had.

"That kid is in for a world of hurt!"
