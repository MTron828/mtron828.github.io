Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The shaking was violent and felt unnatural. Usually even if there was an earthquake of some kind on a planet, Quinn would be able to keep his footing still. Yet for some reason, the shaking of this not only shook the ground but was shaking his whole body as well.

It was as if the air around him was violently shaking about, causing him to move.

'Is this the Behemoth moving?' Quinn thought. 'I'm not even fighting it, I can't even see it and it's shaking the entire place this much. How would I get a clean hit on the thing if I can't even stop myself from moving.'

Due to the way the shaking was working, even if he was to fly or jump, his whole body would still vibrate, and he wasn't the only one being affected, those below were as well.

Eventually though, the shaking had come to a stop, it had only lasted a few seconds. The pillars that they were standing on were still intact, and both of them were fine.

"What happened?" Quinn asked.

"The Behemoth must be sleeping, I imagined it just moved a bit to change its position, that's why the shaking has stopped. We have come at a good time." Mundus claimed.

'That was just from it moving, I wonder how big this beast really is?' Quinn thought.T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

Taking a minute, Quinn looked down below, he was reluctant to just drop down. He could head straight for the beast but instead he was thinking about something else, about the words that Mundus had mentioned.

There was a chance that he would fail to defeat this god slayer, but it wasn't a problem if he did. However, that didn't mean he couldn't take advantage of the situation they were in now.

Looking carefully, Quinn saw a large winged creature that looked somewhat like a giant moth, only it had long legs with multiple joints out of its side like a spider and had two fangs at the front like one as well.

It wasn't too far away. At that moment, he started to gather his blood aura, swirling it around in both arms. He was condensing the power, while on the pillar he had the time to gather and condense the energy, finally Quinn had made two pure red blood spears in his hand.

Before Mundus could ask what he was planning to do, he had already leapt off the pillar a great distance, just far enough to jump over some of the demon tier beasts below, and reached his target, the strange moth-like beast.

While on his way down, he threw the blood spears as hard as he could, the tip of both of the spears started to spin. The blood spears had pierced right through the demon tier beast, going through the bottom of its body and the middle segment, leaving the head and wings untouched.

Screaming in pain, the beast tried to lift itself, attempting to fly away, but when it reached the end of the spear it had hit the bottom part which was larger than the middle section of the spear, it was like a square block.

When creating the spears, Quinn had done this on purpose; the blood spears were never meant to kill the beast, but to stop it from flying away. As Quinn continued to fall, he gathered blood around his gauntlets, opened his hand like tiger claws, and the aura flowed around his fists creating an image of a tiger.

Quinn landed right on top of the beast's body, slamming both of his claws right into the centre of the beast. Waves of red energy went flying and swirling about in the air.

Quickly, Quinn then jumped off. The beast looked incredibly weakened. Quinn had come a fair way from what he was before, he never imagined that he would be able to kill a demon beast of all things, with just three blows, but his aim was never to kill it in the first place.

Now in front of the beast, Quinn had pulled out his dual blood guns and started to fire away, firing at its wings, firing at its legs, and other parts of its body but he made sure not to hit any of its vital spots.

Finally, when the beast looked weak enough, that was when Quinn decided to use his shadow and when it went out, it covered the beast for a couple of seconds and when the shadow disappeared, the beast looked different compared to before.

The spears that were in its body had disappeared, and its eyes were darker with a faint shadow like mist coming off its body.

[You have successfully infected a beast!]

'I won't waste a trip to a planet like this. Right now, what's in front of me is a gold mine that I can use to help in the war. I already have a number of beasts, and three demon tiers, including the ones at the settlement, but if I can capture even more demon tiers to help‚Ä¶ then they can go up against the five spiked Dalki and above!'

Some beasts that were the same type could live next to each other, but demon tier beasts were unique and it was the same here. Nearly every demon tier beast looked different. If the beasts were to get within each other's territory, then it would most likely start a fight immediately.

Which was why, the demon tiers were spread quite a bit apart from each other. This was perfect for Quinn as it wouldn't draw the agro of the other demon tiers while he was fighting, so all he had to do was continue weakening them one by one.

Mundus had eventually appeared by Quinn's side to have a look at what he was doing, and looked at the beast for a few moments and noticed it was no longer attacking, and the energy that was surrounding it.

"I'm guessing this is your doing? What are you doing, shouldn't you be conserving your energy for fighting against the Behemoth, and not wasting your time fighting the rest of these?" Mundus asked.

"This is part of my plan to take the Behemoth down." Quinn replied. "Besides, I'm the one that's in a rush. So don't worry, I will be doing this as quick as I can."

Quinn then used his shadow and soon another beast was summoned. It was the two headed antler beast he had fought with at the settlement, and this beast had a special power, a power that could not only be used on itself but on others as well.

The beast was ordered to go next to the large moth-like creature, and when they stood side by side, its whole body started to light up blue, the light started to transfer over to the moth-like creature, and the wounds that were on its body were starting to heal.

Eventually, the moth demon tier beast was back in action and was able to fight as good as it did before if not better.

"Alright, with these two, let's go onto the next one!" Quinn smiled, as they searched for the closest demon tier beast.

Mundus couldn't quite believe what he was seeing, and it was part of the reason why he was keeping quiet. Quinn was taking control of the demon tier beasts, he was creating an army right in front of his eyes.

With each demon tier beast he took control of, the next one became easier, and eventually three demon tier beasts could take out one on its own while Quinn took out another, and as this number multiplied, it would just start to spread and spread.

'Part of the reason why Immortui was feared was due to his power to create demons from his blood. He could create beings that were on the god slayer level, and the power was able to spread to others. An example of that are the vampires themselves. That was what got the Ancient Ones so worried, that he could create his own army.

'Right now, I am witnessing something on the same level with Quinn's shadow power. Is this the secret he wished for me to keep? Did he know, this is the type of thing that the Ancient Ones fear?'
