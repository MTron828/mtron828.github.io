Chapter 1519 - The Vampire Hunter's Problems (Part 2)

Erin did as she had been told and walked out of her circle. The others weren't sure why these two had been called out, though the young woman feared that they might have realised that she had been holding back.

Rafer first looked towards Berg before explaining: "You two will be coming with me. We will be making a special beast hunting team. As for those within the second circle, you'll be hunting Advanced tier beasts and King tier with the support of some military personnel.

"The first circle group will be fighting Intermediate and Basic tier beasts. We'll assign you a captain, and you'll listen to their orders, understand?!"

The others didn't disagree with this, and the only ones that seemed somewhat upset by their situation were the ones in the third circle that were forced to move to another Shelter.

"Please... My family lives here. I need to protect them if the Dalki come!" An older man ran out, getting on his hands and knees to beg Rafer to be allowed to stay.

"I understand that this is a hard time for everyone. I promise that we will ensure that your family will be safe here. However, we need more people who are strong like you to fight the Dalki with everything we have. If you think you alone can make a difference, should the Dalki invade after they have gone through all of us, I'm afraid you're living in a fantasy and not the real world."

The man pleaded some more, yet to no avail. His head sulked as he gave up on the idea. It was true he wanted to look after his family, but it was also true that he didn't want to go on the frontline against those beasts.

Eventually, heading into the manner, there seemed to be some sort of special meeting that had occurred. For now, Erin had sat down on a sofa, and Berg was sitting opposite her with his arms crossed. He had no beast gear on, and he was in a sleeveless shirt.

It looked like he had a rough time, perhaps it was due to what had happened to the Sunshield family. With them being disbanded and mostly destroyed, only a few of them were left alive. There were more than a handful of factions and families that held grudges against them, because of the Big Four. In the past, two of the families seemed to bully their way through compared to other families the most.

One being the Sunshield family, the other one those under the Truedream flag. Berg started to try to get a peak at the hooded girl's face, when he eventually had caught a good look.

"Erin... I can't believe it. What are you doing here?" Berg stood up in shock, before immediately sitting down. Then, a little worried, he whispered. "Aren't you with Pure?!"

When Erin had left the military academy, there were many that had accused her of being part of Pure, and that they had taken her back. It looked like some still had this impression of her. With no need to hide who she was, and not really caring, she pulled her hood down, revealing her blonde hair.

"Calm down, I'm not with Pure. That was all a set-up. I was with the Cursed faction for a while, and now I'm on my own due to none of your business." Erin claimed, crossing her legs and looking away, wondering what was taking the others so long.

It was clear that Erin didn't want to talk based on the short interaction the two had had, but Berg couldn't help but stare at her. For more reasons than one, Erin was an ice queen beauty at the school.

Yet how, in the short time he didn't know her, had she become even more beautiful. On top of that, he knew her ability was ice, so why hadn't she used it.

Just as Berg was about to pop the question, the doors opened and Rafer was seen walking through. There was another soldier by his side, and what looked like two other Travellers. From what Erin had gathered, they had done similar tests around the Shelter beforehand. Of course, one centre couldn't just measure everyone that needed to be measured.

Although she had also heard news that they were forcing some people to take tests as well. Whether it was right or wrong was a different thing. She could tell that fear was running through the military, of experiencing the same thing that they had done once before.

Before Rafer spoke, he looked at Erin for a few seconds. He was surprised to see such a young woman under the hood. He wondered why such a beautiful person would cover their face like so, but he knew it was rude to stare and went on with the reason they had been gathered.

"Sorry for springing such a surprise on all of you." Rafer apologised as he gestured the other two to sit on the third sofa that was positioned around the square table in the room. Rafer was the only one that was standing while he made his announcement.

Erin glanced at the two others, and tried to sense if there was anything strange about them. Neither of them had Qi, nor were they vampires, that was for sure, but their beast gear was at a good level.

One was a short white haired young adult with a crossbow type beast gear weapon. Something that Erin rarely saw. The range on a crossbow was less than that of a bow, but the advantage was usually the power and speed at which a beast crossbow could be used.

"Now that everyone is here, I want to inform you about the task our special team has." Refer explained. "The white haired Traveller goes by the name of Conan. He used to be part of an A Rank faction and was an A Rank Traveller in the past."

This had come as a surprise to Erin. For one, she thought for sure that if there were any A Rank Travellers they would have been sent to the other Shelter, so why was he here?

"Then we have another Traveller, that goes by the name of Brook." Rafer continued.

Knowing that the white haired man was Conan, Brook was clearly the muscular black man who had tribal tattoos going all the way down his forearms. Although his tattoos and muscles screamed intimidating, his smile showed another story.

When he looked at everyone, he seemed like the most gentle person in the world. It was such a nice smile that some were even put off by it. His choice of weapon on his back was two sickles. Something that would have been used as a farming tool in the past, but since they were beast weapons, Erin was sure they were far more effective.

"Now, I don't want you guys to be shocked when I say this... but the reason we have gathered you all is that we have discovered the location of a Demon tier beast. One that if turned into another weapon might help us tip the scales of war into our favour."

Everyone in the room was left speechless. A Demon tier beast such a rare existence, and them, who felt like nobodies were going to go after it. It felt like an elaborate prank was being set up on them.

"I'll explain a little further for you all. All the factions on the other planets are busy, and I'm sure you know that the other planets are now in control of the Dalki. If anything, finding a Demon tier beast on the few planets that we have is a blessing.

"Also, it's not a humanoid beast, so you don't have to worry too much. No sorry, please do worry since it's a Demon tier beast, but not too much." Rafer started to chuckle, but no one else felt like laughing at this situation.

"How‚Ä¶how are we meant to fight such a thing, just with five of us? I heard all the leaders fought against the last one. How could we defeat such a thing on our own?!" Conan immediately questioned this entire idea.

"That's because you guys are special. I'm sure you know not every Demon tier beast is the same, and we have it on good terms that we should be able to achieve this task with just us."

Hearing this, the others wanted to pull out from the job, but could they even.

"What about me?" Erin asked. "I... am not strong like these guys. Why was I selected?" Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

She wasn't sure if Rafer was able to see through her facade or if it was something else, but she needed to know.

Scratching his head, Rafer gave her a surprising reply.

"I'm actually not too sure about that myself. You see, there is one more person that will be coming on this expedition with us. She was actually the one who gave us information on the Demon tier beast. The only thing she wanted in return was to accompany us‚Ä¶ as well as for us to recruit 'a person in a grey hood, no matter what."

Just as Erin was beginning to guess who it could be, someone else stepped into the room, walking in with a staff in her hand.

"Well, it's been a long time, hasn't it?" Bliss greeted the Dhampir with a smile.
