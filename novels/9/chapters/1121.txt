Chapter 1122 - One Horn evolving

"What did you say?!" Oscar shouted , echoing through the office they were in. The reason for his cry was the new report that had just come in.

There was a nervous look on his assistant’s face as sweat was running down her face. Jane was afraid to repeat the content of it again, for the matter was disbtrastly serious.​​

"We have received an urgent report from the first Earthborn group, they have encountered the One Horned Dalki. The leader in the last war has not only been spotted but appears to have already joined the battle." Jane repeated.

At the moment, Oscar was still on one of the Bertha sh.i.p.s that was nearby the teleporting station. The main reason was due to his gut feeling. It had told him that something would be going on, on that planet.

After hearing the news of the Dalki leader being there, he could only imagine that they were planning something disastrous and if worse came to worse he would have to join in the battle as well.

"Quickly, I must prepare to leave. Samantha and Sach won’t be enough to deal with him. It took all of the four leaders to take him on, and even though we have grown greatly since then, I fear that there may be a larger force than we first thought."

As Oscar was getting ready to leave to head out to the battlefield himself, he couldn’t help but think this planet or base that the Dalki had created, must somehow be crucial to them. There was no other explanation as to why One Horn would be there personally.

’Could this be the base that allows them to communicate with the V? If so, we have to capture it at all costs. Winning the battle might be the key to ending the war!’ Oscar thought, as he rushed over.

At the same time, in the Dalki mountain-like structure that they used as their main base, Graham was the only Dalki present today, only he wasn’t alone for there was a vampire sitting opposite him.

"Do you think it was the right decision? You have sent out two of your strongest forces, Slicer and One Horn." Jim asked.

"Of course, else I wouldn’t have sent them out." Graham replied matter of factly. "You should worry about completing your own job. I have already given you a force to help you with that, have I not?"

"Yes, but you see I have lent that force to another, so once again I am left on my own, well not without my own people." The vampire stated.

"Jim, you are a smart person, I’m sure you can guess what will happen. One Horn was sent out to fulfill the deal we made. Consider it our way to prove to you that we are indeed trustworthy. He won’t fail his mission and neither will Slicer."

"The humans are still unaware of our true strength. There is no single human in existence that could defeat Slicer or One Horn at the moment. Perhaps if all the powerhouses were to come together it might be a different story, but that is why I instructed them to strike two different places at roughly the same time." Graham explained.

"Not a single human? I guess you believe the vampires are stronger then." Jim spoke. "However, if not a single human can beat them, then what about you? Does that make you invincible?"

"If only we didn’t have one defect when you created us." Graham answered with a smile, which showed his vicious sharp teeth. No matter how much he dressed in human clothing, or made himself appear human, his teeth would forever reveal what he truly was.

Seeing the partly broken single horn on the Dalki’s head that had landed in front of the two generals, they immediately recognised him. It didn’t take long for Samantha to activate her soul weapon. Bringing up the nine tails of earth that would come out from the ground and stay around her.

As for General Sach, his power stemmed from his nearly invincible body, and he needed to get up close to the Dalki. Charging in, Sach leapt forward pushing from the ground throwing out his knee with full force.

As it hit the Dalki, the force could be seen coming out from the other side of his body, and Samantha thought this was the perfect chance for her to use her soul weapon, throwing out all of the nine tails with the pointed tips towards the Dalki’s back.

’Please be hurt enough so he says still for just a second!’ She silently prayed.

The tails were inches away from the Dalki’s back, and were aiming right where their heart would be. It looked like they could possibly deal with this quickly.

"You’ve underestimated us! You’re not the only race capable of growing stronger!" Sach shouted, as he prepared to perform another kick.

The tails had hit the Dalki, but they all smashed at that point including the tips, breaking and chucking up piles of the ground falling to the floor. Samantha’ eyes were spread wide open as it was the first time her soul weapon, the sharp tips she could place on her earth ability had failed to pierce anything. It would even work on the Dalki.

Sach went to kick the Dalki’s head with all his strength. Although the beast gear he was wearing didn’t perticulley have any active skills, it was focused on the strength aspect more than anything. Having great strength and speed already, Sach was expecting to kill the Dalki with a single hit.

But, all he could see was that the formerly unmoving Dalki, finally acted, by grabbing General Sach’s leg with a single hand. The kicks the military man had trained for a number of years had been stopped just like that.

And that’s when Samntha realised they were in for a world of trouble, as she stared at the back of the Dalki. Seeing the horn they had already gauged how much of a threat he would pose, so they had acted fast. One Horn, a strong four spiked Dalki, they assumed him to be the leader of their race, however the number of spikes coming from his back, no longer matched their intel.

’Is this the power of a five spike? Even us head generals seem to stand no chance.’ Samantha thought.

"Run! " Sach shouted. "Get out of here and warn everyone!"

The next second, Sach’s body was slammed hard into the ground while being held by his ankle. The ground broke beneath him, but his body was fine. Thanks to his ability he was pretty resilient.

"Oh, I think you are the first human I have met whose body didn’t suddenly splat into red liquid from doing that. I think I’m going to have a lot of fun with you!" One Horn grinned as he looked over Sach.

When being told to come here by Graham, One Horn was against the idea. He had thought this job would be pretty annoying and he didn’t quite understand why they were going through with this ’Promise’ of theirs anyway.

As such, the Dalki was now quite excited to find someone that looked like they could put up something. When the Dalki attempted to swing Sach, again into the ground in another area, he tried his best to press off the ground, kicking off using a force equal in power.

’It’s going to be hard with one leg, but I have to use everything I have.’

At the same time, the ground beneath him rose and shot up, and the one doing the work was none other than Samantha. With the forces joining together and all of Sach’s beast armour powering him, he was somewhat able to equal the force of the Dalki, and was now head height with the Dalki, but One Horn refused to let go of the leg.

Spinning his body, not caring for breaking his bones, Sach kicked the forearm of the Dalki, not once but several times. Each time the air rippled on the other side of the forearm.

"You want me to let go that badly, then be my guest!" The Dalki said, as he swung Sach up high in the air letting him go, and he was soon sent flying, as he continued to go higher and higher into the sky.

"Sach!" Samntha cried out. She needed to save him somehow, catch him or create something to cushion his fall, but she knew the Dalki wouldn’t allow her to move.

’But what can I do!’ She thought, and it also looked like the Dalki forces were getting a second wind, as the humans from the shelter were starting to support them. Fighting against the military power that was attacking them.

"I...."

"Back down now!" A voice ordered her, and a tunnel of ice shot out, heading straight for the Dalki. This attack made it clear that he had arrived. Oscar, the supreme commander of the military and leader of the Earthborn group.

’A five spike here of all places. This wasn’t in the report.’ Oscar thought. ’It looks like we need to call for help as soon as possible. Quinn, Owen, I can’t do this alone.’

Alas, for now he would have to.
