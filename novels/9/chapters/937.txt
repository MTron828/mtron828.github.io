Chapter 938 - Juicy Rewards

Slowly opening his eyes, Quinn felt the best he had ever felt in a long time. It reminded him of when he was a young teenager and, on the weekends, would sleep in until three in the afternoon. There was no one to wake him up and nag him anyway like others had. Ever since turning, being thrown into all of this mess, it felt like he didn’t even have a single day to rest.

’I thought life back then was hard, and now look at this.’ Quinn thought.

He realised that he was in a bed, one that he had come to recognise as his own in the Castle. Although slightly different as it had been rebuilt after being destroyed from Borden’s and Remus’s battle. It was hardly noticeable since all the rooms were quite similar.

A large Victorian style bed, with old furnishings and rugs that had been there for who knew how many years.

"You’re finally awake, sleepy head," Layla said, who was by his side and had the most genuine smile he had ever seen. It was clear that she was happy to see him awake.

Knowing that there were now people there for him and that cared for him, it was a reminder of why he fought so hard.

"What was that strange dream?" Quinn mumbled as he slowly got up. "I remembered being back at school." He said, touching his head.

"Do you want me to call over the others and tell them you’re awake, or do you want to rest for a little longer," Layla asked, knowing full well that the others would barge in full of excitement if she told them the news.

The others were a handful, and if Quinn was half awake, it would be hard for him to handle them.

"Rest would be good for now. Just give me a little more time." Quinn said.

Saying this, Layla thought it was best she left as well. Of course, there was a lot Quinn wanted to know, but just for a few hours, she didn’t want him to worry about being the leader of the Cursed family, or one of the leaders of the human race. She just wanted him to be Quinn.

Just as she was about to shut the door though, He had a few words for her.

"I’m sorry," Quinn said. "I think I know what happened to Cia. I’m sorry I wasn’t there to save her."

Layla turned around and smiled while shaking her head.

"Quinn, you don’t need to apologise anymore. We have been on this journey with you long enough. Besides Cia, she died happily. At least, I would like to believe that. And you did everything you could. Your towers and the defences you set up. We all survived that day due to your help.

"I think I realised we should start being more thankful for what we have, rather than what we have lost." Closing the door behind her, Quinn was finally left on his own.

He was sitting there in disbelief on his bed, thinking about what he had just been through. The fight he had just had trying to remember every single detail.

But what actually had him most exited, were the rewards he was about to receive.

While passing out from exhaustion, Quinn heard several pings go off in his head, and screens appearing in front of him, but he was unable to check out exactly what they were.

’So system, you didn’t think I could beat her? So much so that you didn’t even bother giving me a quest. At least it looks like you know when to reward someone when they are in the wrong.’ Quinn thought over the moon, ready to open up the notification screens.

[The Tenth family thinks very highly of you]

[The Vampire settlement has learnt of your deeds]

[You have gained a total of 50,000 reputation points]

[You have reached the maximum amount of reputation points] ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

[You can now upgrade your Castle, to ’Level Two’ in exchange for 50,000 points]

Seeing all the information pop up in front of him, it was great news. He didn’t know what it meant by upgrading his Castle, but if anything cost 50,000 points, undoubtedly it had to be good.

Seeing the temptation in front of him, he couldn’t help but press the button at that moment.

[Your Castle is now being upgraded to ’Level two’]

At first, it seemed like nothing was happening, and Quinn wondered if he could see some changes out of his window that showed the tenth settlement as a whole. As soon as he got up on his feet. Rumbling started, and the whole Castle seemed to be shaking.

’What is going on, Vincent? What’s happening?’ Quinn asked.

’I have no idea. Your system’s ability has gone beyond whatever I was capable of. It’s far too advanced.’ Although Vincent didn’t say it, he was kind of jealous and wished he had the system when he was still alive. He would have loved to experiment in so many different ways to fully understand the system.

In a way, for the system to be handed to someone as young as Quinn, with a not so great of a mind, was a little bit of a waste.

Finally, the rumbling had stopped, and Quinn immediately rushed out to see if there had been any grand changes. The first he spotted was at the very edge of the inner castle area. All of the walls were larger and thicker than they once were.

The jagged black rock the wall’s used to be made off was no more, and now the black material looked to have been turned into large smooth stones. Fitting for a real castle wall. It also was twice as high and nearly twice as thick.

’I wonder how strong that wall is?’ Quinn thought.

What Quinn failed to realise more than anything was the amount of attention this was having on the vampires in the settlement. It was sure to grab the attention of the other families as well. In a few seconds, grand changes had been made to the castle walls, and it stood out compared to the rest, even the King’s Castle.

What Quinn also didn’t know was that the Castle itself had changed as well. Like the walls, the Castle’s material was now made in the same style, and it looked to have even grown slightly in size.

Quinn could already hear everyone in the Castle making a commotion from the others inside.

’Oh, this is going to be a headache and a half. I better check if there was anything else as well.’ Quinn thought.

Scrolling down through the notifications, there was still more to come.

[You have done the impossible, the system is impressed]

[It is sorry for doubting you]

[Reward +10 levels]

[Ten stat points have been received]

Seeing this, Quinn decided to use his stat points. He didn’t know what trouble he might get into around the corner. Looking at his stats, he realised that he quite enjoyed being a balanced fighter.

Each stat was essential to him, Although lately, the charm skill seemed useless. It was strong enough to influence most humans and weak vampires, but now with the type of opponents, he was facing. It was nearly impossible to attempt to control them.

After putting in the stat points as he wished they now were as follows:

[Strength 70]

[Agility 65]

[Stamina 63]

[Charm 60]

These stats were without Quinn wearing any beats equipment. He decided to put his strength stat at the next stage since it was already the closest, and Quinn always saw the most significant jump every ten stat points.

[You have witnessed the use of Great blood control]

[Your knowledge of blood control has increased]

[You know have 50 points in blood control]

The good news seemed to keep on coming. The ten levels were the biggest increase Quinn had ever received, and he thought these were the best rewards he had gotten as well. He wanted to jump up and down in excitement, but at the same time, he just felt like it was embarrassing to do so.

’You deserve it, Quinn. That was a battle I don’t think many would have been able to survive. Some might have said you were lucky to receive this system.’ Vincent then cleared his throat as he was one of those people. ’However, I know that even if others were put in your situation, they wouldn’t have achieved the same result, and I believe the system thinks the same.’

Hearing these words from Vincent of all people, for some reason, it made him feel the proudest.

"Thanks...Grandpa." Quinn jokingly said once more.

It was the end of the rewards for Quinn, but not the end of the messages, for there was one more, and this one was a new quest. He was quite surprised at this since he believed after getting the ’Become the vampire king’ Quest, he wouldn’t receive anything after, or at least until he had completed it.

[New Quest received]

[The strength inside you is growing, and something is starting to emerge, but what is it?]

[Find out what lies beyond that of a Vampire lord?]

[Quest requirements: ????]

[Quest reward: ????]
