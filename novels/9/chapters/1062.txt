Chapter 1063 - Two strong forces

Slowly opening his eyes, Ko could feel a constant, dull pain on the top of his head. When they were finally fully opened, he could see the dark sky.

"What happened?" He slowly asked, lifting his body up and looking around. As the pain went away, Ko also started to remember what had happened just seconds before.

‚ÄôI was on the ground, and looking at Ely. Wait, my family. What happened to my family!‚Äô Ko thought.

He could find no traces of his wife and daughter. His head twisted and turned and eventually he could see his friend Ely huffing and panting.

"You!" Ko shouted as he ran towards his friend.

"Wait, Ko, what the hell are you doing!" Ely said as he turned with the crossbow still in his hand. It was loaded, but he didn‚Äôt want to shoot his friend, especially if he hadn‚Äôt been marked.

"Your family, they‚Äôre fine!" He said as he quickly pointed a distance away.

Ko looked at where he was pointing at, and ran over to see that the Marked were crawling towards the two of them. His wife‚Äôs legs and arms had been badly hit with arrows and it was the same for his daughter.

One would have been in immense pain from the wounds alone. Falling to his knees, Ko wished he could have been in their position instead.

"I would have never killed your family, Ko, but I knew that you couldn‚Äôt hurt them either. The only thing I could do was slow down their moments. The Marked, even if we take out their legs, they can crawl incredibly fast with their arms. I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt want you to see what I was going to do." Ely said.

Ko was left crying and even with their hands and legs badly injured, they were crawling on the ground with their glowing eyes. That‚Äôs when he noticed that their wounds, although their muscles had been injured, it looked like Ely had attempted to patch them up at the same time.

"Ely, did you?"

"I know these beings seem to have a stronger will to live, but when we kill the Demon tier beast, who knows if their wounds will kill them or not. I needed to be sure. We have a job to do, you were the one who said it, kill the Demon tier beast and everyone will be free from this mess." Ely explained.

Picking himself up, he looked at his daughter and wife‚Äôs face one more time. The Marked in the area didn‚Äôt seem to get hurt by the beasts or anything else, and he wanted to stay by their side. He wanted to make sure they would be okay.

However, if Ko didn‚Äôt act, then they wouldn‚Äôt be okay. The people he was looking at right now were not his wife and daughter, and it took a lot of self-convincing for him to move his feet and head down the tunnel into the Shelter, on the way to the pink tree.

Inside the faction hall, currently, there were over three hundred or so marked, ready to jump on the large group that was in the middle, but they stood still, and so did the Graylash members that were there, as well as a single man who had just stopped their attack.

"If you kind people would be able to deal with the Marked, then I will take care of the troublesome ones." Eno said, and before they could say anything, they could no longer see him in front of them.

The next second, a Graylash member had been kicked in the head and sent flying across the room. They turned and fired lighting towards Eno, but spirals of blood from his hands would spin, blocking the attack, making it seem like it did nothing.

"You will need to try a lot harder than that!" Eno said. "I know plenty of people who could take you on with ease."

lightning strikes appeared consistently. Without a second thought, Eno pulled a Graylash member directly in front of him. His body took all of the attacks instead. When being struck by the lighting the body was shocked for a couple of seconds but the person seemed to still be conscious and moving, still trying to break free.

Seeing this, Eno kicked the man‚Äôs legs before chucking him over to the other side, and soon noticed that the first one he had hit was walking again.

"Hmm, so your power really has made them resilient." Eno said.

While Eno was fighting the Graylash family, he had the attention of all of the members and sure enough, the Marked had all charged forward. At first, the faction members were scared, but it looked like they had no reason to be at all. With their backs facing each other and with them in the middle, they were being protected by what could be described as a wall of muscle.

The hardest part for the faction members when fighting against the Marked, was their overwhelming strength, speed and the fact that they never seemed to tire, but looking at those in the Cursed, they seemed like monsters themselves.

Peter, and Linda both had the strength of several of the Marked, and could continually use their strength to throw, break their enemies bones and make it so not a single person could get past. The others were far faster than any of the Marked as well, with Layla, Fex and Wevil having superior bodies, it looked like they didn‚Äôt need to do anything at all.

It was so calm that the others could see what Eno was doing while fighting. The Marked just seemed like an annoyance for them. That‚Äôs when Linda saw it.

‚ÄôIt‚Äôs annoying how you keep getting up." Eno said. "So I will just have to see if this works." His body moved away from one of the Graylashe‚Äôs again, and this time, Eno was directly in front of the leader. His hand was already covered in the blood aura, spinning like a drill.

The next second, the Graylash member was lifted into the air as his hand went through his stomach, and then chucked over to the side. The Graylash member was now no longer moving.

"You killed your own!" A Graylash member said.

"My own? Do you think me and them are the same?"

It was clear that the Demon tier beast that was controlling the people was taken aback by this. One of the main reasons the Marked could spread around so easily, was because the humans were afraid of killing their own.

Even the faction members, and Hayley were stunned by this. However, they didn‚Äôt blame Eno for what he had done. At this moment, it truly felt like it was either the Marked lives, or theirs.

Moving onto the next one, Eno was ready to shove his blood drill through another. Until the man‚Äôs eyes were no longer glowing, and the markings on his body started to fade.

"Wait, no, the demon beast is no longer controlling him!" Hayley shouted, paying attention to what was going on.

The man‚Äôs eyes were now sane and as he saw the attack coming towards him, he saw no sign of it slowing down.

At the last second, a strong lightning bolt came, shooting out, hitting the blood drill away, flinging Eno‚Äôs hand in the air.

"Now you choose to come in?" Eno said.

"Quinn wouldn‚Äôt want us to do this. We can beat them without having to kill them!" Sil shouted.

"Why make the task more difficult? And how helpful can these people really be if they have allowed themselves to be taken over by a demon tier beast?‚Äô Eno asked.

Sil now had both of his hands wrapped in lighting. Eno chose to ignore him and moved to the next person, but taking a step forward, he was hit again, this time hitting his body.

The strike was so strong, a hole had been made through his bicep, but it soon started to heal directly on the spot.

"Very well!" Eno said moving forward.

Moving his hands, each time Sil would produce a lightning strike towards Eno. The two of them were now suddenly fighting against each other.

The clashes between them were so strong that the Graylash members were unable to act, every time they tried to, they would be hit by a stray attack, flinging them off to the side. Two great powers in the room were colliding, and the enemy could do nothing to stop them.

"What! Now the problem isn‚Äôt the Marked or the Graylash, but we have to worry about these two trying to kill each other!" Linda said.

"I think the bigger worry is if they kill us in the process of their fight!" Said Fex.
