*****

A liquid substance could be felt coming out from Ray's mouth. He had to admit that the blow was an impressive one to cause him to spit out his saliva, but when wiping his mouth, the black blood on his hands made him aware that it wasn't saliva, but it was indeed blood.

'This one, he manged to hurt me, through my armour, and through my body?'

The fight might have seemed even, or going back and forth, but when one observed the fight closely, Ray had hurt Quinn several times. It was only due to his vampire healing abilities and the blood stored in his mask that he would regenerate back to the way he was.

For Ray, he felt like this was the first true wound of the fight.

'Let's give him something back!' Ray opened his mouth and the orange energy bubbled in his mouth.

In the middle of preparing his attack, a large pain could be felt right in his stomach once again. A pulse of red aura, the same as the last time had appeared, coming from his stomach. Ray was forced to close his mouth shut, as the force of an attack sent him backwards.

Opening his mouth, part of his dark orange aura has escaped everywhere, while bits of blood was mixed in as well. This attack had done more damage than the first one, as Ray was unprepared for it.

'How‚Ä¶ where did that attack come from? He didn't touch me, it didn't look like he moved either.' Ray thought, gritting his teeth.

He flapped his wings, recovering fast, and opened his mouth, firing out fireballs once again. He didn't want to get hit so fast, not until he discovered what had occured.

Quinn quickly moved out of the way of the two fireballs, and gave chase towards Ray. Flapping his wings, he continued to move, firing fireballs, and it almost looked like Ray was on the back foot running away.

'The attack‚Ä¶ it must have hurt him!' Quinn realised. 'His reaction has completely changed now. The flow of the fight, is in my court.'

The red shadow, a combination of the shadow and blood aura, something Quinn had spent time creating, had a delayed effect, where the original attack would repeat itself. It was how Quinn was able to push back the fists even though he was weaker in power than Ray.

And, it was how he was able to get a second attack on Ray. This was the skill that allowed him to overcome Asura in battle, and it might be the winning factor for the fight with Ray.

'I have to do as much damage to him before he figures out what's happening.'

Ray was constantly running away, and he could see Quinn was doing the same trick as last time. While firing some of the energy blasts towards him, he was allowing for some of them to linger in the air.

Which was why Quinn decided to somewhat return the favour, moving around with his hands, he was opening up shadow portals almost everywhere. Then activating the effect on his boots he had made a total of four clones of himself; the maximum was making four Quinn's.

Finally, Quinn also used the shadow to make a further fifth clone, and now there were five clones. Each of them split off, in search of Ray, trying to come at him from different directions.

'This is nothing compared to what Sil can do, but it's still something that I can do, to win this fight!' Quinn thought.

Ray had no idea which of the Quinn's was the real one, so with all the flames in the area, he decided the best thing to do was attack them all, the problem was Quinn had made the first more.

Each of the clones including the original, gathered their aura, they gathered the blood shadow as well, and started to produce the most powerful blood swipes they could create. The attacks went through the shadow portals that were placed everywhere and the attacks were now coming from all different directions at Ray.

When the blood swipes hit Ray, they dispersed in the air, turning into nothing but particles. One after the other continued to hit Ray.

The attacks did next to nothing, his armour was too strong, the power was too weak. Quinn knew this, he could have gathered more of his aura to create a large blood sword, or a blood spear that might have done something, but that wasn't his intention.

Soon, as the blood swipes continued to hit Ray, he was feeling the effect of the blood shadow, now it felt like he was being hit with twice as many blood swipes.

None of the attacks were getting through, but even if one wore a complete bulletproof vest, the raining down of swipes would distract them and that's exactly what Quinn was aiming for.

In the middle of all of the attacks, popping out from one of the shadows right from behind, Quinn gathered both of his hands, the fire effect from the mask continued to power his blood, and it was thrown forward right into Ray's back.

The two giant blood fire dragon's covered in the blood shadow were seen in the air as it smashed against Ray's back and went right through again.

HIs wings crumpled in pain as he crashed into the floor. Ray had been hurt, but he was quick to get up; he wouldn't be down for long, but the second attack had taken its effect, it hit him once again breaking the ground and causing him to grit his teeth until he had eventually stopped.

Ray had lifted his hands while his head was down, and spread them out, all of the fireballs in the air continued to move and crashed into the shadow. When they did, all of the shadow portals that were around the place had disappeared.

"I should've aimed for the shadow from the beginning rather than the stupid clones." Ray said looking up, still seeing the five Quinn's in the air.

Ray also noticed that even if Quinn had gotten the jump on him, that he should have been able to stop the last attack, but his movements were slightly slower. The mist that was all over in the air, at a close inspection it was the shadow.

"I know the shadow power very well. My own power can even get rid of it!" Ray said. HIs raw energy had been shown multiple times to break through the shadow.

That was why Quinn was unable to use it to block, and just now, it was how Ray was able to destroy the shadow portals.

"But these uses of the shadow, and that Dark Red shadow, is something I have never seen before. How is it possible, how long have you had the shadow for?" Ray asked.

Quinn saw a moment here, a moment that he could perhaps convince Ray.

"You are starting to realise that something doesn't feel right?" Quinn said. "I have technically had the shadow power for over a 1000 years. You were the one that told me the shadow power came from someone you knew!

"How would I know this unless you told me! You said you placed all your powers into the tablet to protect the humans from the threats in the future. I know you're a good person Ray, you're just fighting for the wrong side!"

"The wrong side?" Ray said. "The humans are the ones behind me, while you have teamed up with aliens. It's quite simple how you could know what happened in the past, but you do have a point about having the shadow for so long and me not knowing about it‚Ä¶ it doesn't fit.

"But there's one thing I do know, if the shadow has come back, and it's stronger than ever, then I have to get rid of it once again."

Ray tapped the chest peice of his armour. In between the lines of the carefully crafted scales, it all started to light up red with power. In doing so, Ray's appearance also started to change.

Rather than the black scales that were on his face, and the Dalki features he had, they started to turn a dark red, including the spikes that were on his back, and his wings as well.

"You are impressive enough to force me to use the power of the Dragon armour."
