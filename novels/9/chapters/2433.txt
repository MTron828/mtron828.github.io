At the moment, all Quinn was doing was staring at Immortui. The strange blood area still existed, as Quinn's hardened blood that had pierced the Durum demons was still standing upright from the ground. Although most of their bodies had been blown away or disintegrated when Immortui had landed.¬†

No one in the area was moving, only the sound of faint breathing could be heard. It sounded incredibly silent for a planet. Not even the wind was moving. It all came with the sudden appearance of Immortui, so they could only imagine it was his doing.

Lifting his head up, Immortui opened his mouth wide letting out a loud belly of laughter.¬†

"HAHAHA!" The sound transmitted through the air. It wasn't amplified or sounded ear bursting like some forms of power. Instead it almost sounded like Immortui was laughing right next to both Quinn and Calva, while he was many metres away.

"After all this time, I finally get to meet you." Immortui said. "This really isn't how I would have liked to have met. I tried to communicate to you so many times, in so many different ways, and now you have decided to come to me, and the first thing you do is cause a large disturbance."¬†

With his strange black and white coloured eyes, Immortui was looking at the area. He was reconstructing in his head what had happened at the scene. Just from the fight with his demon king, he was trying to gauge just how strong the fight was.¬†

"Was it a one sided battle even with all the Durum demons? It looks like you have almost made an entire demon race, and not just any, one of my greatest creations, extinct."

Immortui was smiling when he said this, making it hard to tell whether he was happy or upset by this fact.¬†

From Quinn's memories the fight was fairly easy in his demon form, and if one was to look at just his body, Immortui was right he was hardly hurt, but he had lost a lot in that battle, more than one realised.¬†

"Well, why don't we call it even, and start with a fresh slate." Immortui suggested. "You killed an entire demon race that was my own creation, and I killed some vampires that you cared about. So why don't we have a calm talk."¬†

Quinn really didn't want to talk, he was doing everything in his power to stop himself from charging in and attempting to knock his head off. He knew though, that despite the fact that he couldn't feel any energy coming off from this celestial in front of him, he was powerful.¬†

Trying to do something by surprise would do nothing, and right now it was best for Quinn to buy some time. Who knew how long it would take for his armour to heal, and for his demon form to come back.¬†

Although he didn't want to rely on the latter, he was in a situation where he might have to.

"What do you want?" Quinn asked.¬†

A big smile appeared on Immortui's face, because he felt like he had caught Quinn's attention.¬†

"I'm sure with the way you are, the strength you have gathered, you have already experienced some of the misdoings from the ones that call themselves the gods." Immortui stated. "The ones who call themselves Ancient Ones who have been ruling everything the way they wish for so long.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

"Those hypocritical b*stards!" Immortui fist pulsed black and white, turning his entire fist monochrome for a moment before fading back away. "I did everything they said. I followed their ways and continued to gather celestial power, all for the sake of keeping the world balanced as they stated.¬†

"I continued to grow stronger and my influence in the celestial space as well as the golden space was growing. When I had finally reached the same level as them, I expected to be given a hand to join them. A seat and to be treated as an equal.¬†

"After all, according to their philosophy, if I obtained power and influence able to match theirs, then wasn't that the will of the Universe. Didn't they want me to get as powerful as them in order to balance things out?

"No instead they shunned me, they tried to push me out and trample me, so I was unable to match them in power. There were no rules, those Ancient Ones were just making up sh*t as they go, because they were the ones at the top.

"I bet with you they are doing the same thing. As you grow stronger, they are growing more fearful of you, Quinn. They will do everything they can to stunt your growth, and if they aren't able to control you, then they will get rid of you.¬†

"For me, they were unable to get rid of me. The Universe wouldn't allow it, because it is my duty to get rid of them. The Universe has given me a destiny and that is what I will accomplish."¬†

Hearing out Immortui, Quinn could understand how he had come this way. He had watched the celestials caring nothing but about completing their condition, as it fed them. The lives on the planets they overlooked, thousands of years passed so it meant nothing to them.¬†

In the end, what kept all of the celestials going was their belief that the universe had given them this condition in order for it to keep on going. For Immortui he felt like he was just doing that.¬†

He had long ago disconnected from the individual lives on each planet, and instead just did everything for the sake of his goal. In some ways it was the way Quinn had to force himself to think while he was here in the red space.¬†

He had to ignore everything to get what he wanted. In the end, every person, the Ancient Ones, Immortui, and Quinn himself, were all being selfish, but Quinn was being selfish in the fact that he wanted to protect the people he cared about. Whereas Immortui's selfishness had a path of destruction, a war with the Ancient Ones.¬†

Who cared who was right or wrong, for Quinn he just wanted the best path to live a happy life.¬†

"Whether I understand you or not, it doesn't really matter, nor whether I agree with you or not." Quinn said. "But what I want to know, why me, why did you need to drag me into all of this.¬†

"Can't you go and wage your war, fight the Ancient Ones, without having to get the ones I care about involved?" Quinn asked.

"Because you have a piece to play in all of this as well." Immortui answered. "You are a piece of my creation whether you like it or not. And whether I liked it or not, your power had stopped my many attempts at growing my own power, and now I see why. All of that was to allow you to grow stronger, and in turn, your strength will help me break free from this, and together we will be able to defeat the Ancient Ones.

"What I should ask you, Quinn, is what do you want, do you not want to fix the mistakes you made? What if I told you, there was a way for you to do that? For you to rescue all of those loved ones you care about so much?" Immortui asked.¬†
