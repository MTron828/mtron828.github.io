Chapter 2460 Sil's Loyalty (Part 1)

Looking at the giant hole below, Sil didn't teleport down there straight away. The view in front of him, it was such a sight to behold that he had to look at it for a few moments more. He had travelled to many planets before in his search but he had never seen anything like this.

It was magical, the plants leaves from below were shining with colour, reflecting as if they were partly metal, even though one could tell they were plants from the way they flowed in the air.

"Alright, let's go find her." Sil said, after taking a mental picture. If he could, he hoped something like this wouldn't get destroyed, that way he could return. If he ever knew he had only a few moments left to live, then this was the place he would have wanted to be.

The feeling was similar to how one felt when they walked across the beach, with the sea and the sunset. It was warm.

Teleporting down, the amazement didn't stop there, as now Sil was able to see the objects up close. There were all types of plants of different shapes and sizes. Some had thick trunks that swirled around others like a snake.

Others just looked like a giant pineapple down below.

"Don't we need to be careful?" Sil asked. "Although you know the Champion is here, doesn't that mean that there is also the chance that there are demons here as well."

Calva thought Sil was right, but he was unable to sense or see any demons in the area. Were they so sure that Pultra had nowhere to escape to, so she would just stay down here, or was it something else?

"I don't think anyone is here, maybe because it's so close to the palace, they just have someone check up on her frequently. I mean as time goes on and nothing happens, they could become more lax about her perhaps escaping.' Calva guessed, but with the addition of them and the others arriving, maybe everything was different now.

In order to speed up the process, Sil used his soul weapon, opening up the book and changing one of his abilities. He then touched the ground, and a pulsating power was sent out.

It would allow him to have a look at all of the objects around them. A scouting ability that would typically only work within a few metres, but in this case, Sil could use it in an extremely large range. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

"I've found her, we should head in this direction. Maybe let's not teleport so we startle her." Sil suggested. After all, they didn't know if she was on their side yet.

If the meeting didn't go how Calva expected, with her joining them, then in order to make sure she wouldn't tell anyone, she would have to be killed on the spot.

Walking through, they had come to an area with fewer giant plants compared to the others. Instead they could see large roots that had been torn up from the ground, and were heading in one direction.

When they got out of the thick leaves, they followed the roots with their eyes, and were laying eyes on a giant tree placed in the middle. Its trunk was incredibly thick, as thick as an entire apartment building.

However, the tree wasn't very tall, maybe around thirty metres in height, but then its greenery above spread out far and wide allowing only rays of light to hit the ground. It had done so in such a way, that left an odd feeling.

An enclosed place, an open one, it was hard to tell as they were covered in the shade of the leaves, while lights sparkled through.

"Out of all the people I expected to see here, I never thought I would see your ugly face." A soft voice said, carried by the wind, going directly into their ears.

Lying against the tree itself, with its legs out, there was a figure. The shape was quite feminine with a lot of curves in the legs and body. It also looked mostly human-like from what Sil could recognize.

However, it clearly wasn't a human, the skin was a lighty blue all over its body with patches of white that looked as if it was glittering even now. There were no clothes on the person, nor was there any hair on the body, including the top of its head which was an egg shape.

What drew Sil in a bit was the eyes, a solid thick colour of light green. They were solid with no pupil or any other colour. Yet somehow they had great beauty that would draw him in.

This was Pultra, the first Champion who had gone up against Immortui. Seeing that she had guests, she stood up. Now Sil could see that her legs were extremely long as they were longer than her head and torso of her body, making it look like she was on some form of stilts.

Yet, she was only a little taller than Sil himself. As she walked, her legs crossed each other, like someone on a catwalk in high heels.

"Are you Pultra?" Sil asked.

"I see the stranger knows my name. I'm assuming you are the one that managed to break out Calva then, and managed to get in here without alerting the Yaks." Pultra said, as she continued to look at Sil, ignoring Calva.

"The current situation outside is stranger than you think." Just as Calva was ready to say some more, Sil interrupted him.

"Why are you kept here?" Sil asked.

Before asking her to join, Sil wanted to know what her power was. What made her so special that she had to be kept here. She did indeed have to be worth their time for coming here.

"This here is a garden for Immortui and the demons. They plant special materials inside. Plants, metals, rocks, all sorts of things that they need. You see, this world is a strange place.

"There are plenty of mystical items that contain great powers, but do you know what the main problem is? It's time, the time it takes for these items to grow in power. My body has an effect on things, on plants, on general life around me.

"Within a certain range, as long as I stay somewhere, things will grow at a much quicker pace than they are meant to. Something that should take ten years to sprout will take ten days, as long as I stay in one place.

"So the demons come here, while keeping me here as they gather their precious items once in a while. What they are using it for, I don't know‚Ä¶ I don't get out much you see, unlike your friend here." Pultra smiled at Calva.

It was a strange power to hear of, even in Sil's powers he had nothing like it, and he wondered what that had to do with the waterfall going backwards, or if it was unrelated.

Either way, this person was special, Sil could tell that much.

"We‚Ä¶ we are here to ask you for your help." Sil said.
