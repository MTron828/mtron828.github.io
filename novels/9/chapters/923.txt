Chapter 924 - Eat it!

The bloodl.u.s.t could be felt in the air, and as Peter looked at all the vampires that surrounded them, each of their eyes were glowing red, saliva dripping from their hungry mouths. Some of them were covered in wounds, as they were fighting against each other just seconds ago. It was amazing how their natural instincts had come out the second they had all smelt the same thing, human blood.

Usually to Logan, vampires appear quite human in his eyes, they had emotion, high levels of intelligence, but looking at them now, they just looked like wild beasts. Where their urges had taken over every thought in their body.

It wasn’t only those in the eighth family that were eyeing up Logan, but also those all around in the area as well.

"Is it a human? What is a human doing here?"

"This smell, it’s so sweet!!" Another screamed, piercing it;s own skin with it’s finger nails from it’s excitement.

A Lot of these vampires were from the pooling area. Other than the same blood they got everyday from the packs, they had never smelt pure fresh blood.

Logan was up against the wall he had been hit against by the bloodsucker, and Peter was now standing in front of him. His back that usually looked small had never looked so big to him at this moment.

"Peter, it’s best if you stay in this position." Logan tried to explain, but the pain from the internal strike was hurting him greatly. A sharp pain was felt with every breath he took. Unlike the others he idnd;t have Qi to support himself, and now was regretting that he didn’t attempt to learn it a little. "If we are up against this wall, then they can only come at us from the front..and Peter..if you think you can’t make it out, then just leave." Logan said, and hysterically started to cough out even more blood after.

More blood spilled onto the floors and finally the first vampire couldn’t take it anymore. It was a vampire that held onto its broken arm and was covered in wounds. It looked like it would fall over at any second.

"Logan, shut up and stop making my job harder!" Peter shouted as he punched the vampire in the head coming towards them, and smashed it on the ground for it to never get up again. Soon another one was in front, and Peter kicked it with his leg as hard as he could, sending the vampire tumbling into the others.

A blood swipe from another vampire had hit his body but it didn’t do much and Peter continued to use his great strength to show them all they were no match for him. His speed, his power was all on another level, and even though he coudln;t use blood powers, it was useless at their level, compared to his healing abilities.

"Come on! You little craps. I’ll blow all of you away!" Peter shouted continuously hitting every vampire that he could see.

A part of him inside thought that they might give up, but seeing their precious meal right in front of them, they never did stop, no matter how much Peter was hurting them.

One vampire that had parts of its body crushed was crawling across the floor, and it wasn’t until Peter stomped on its head that it finally gave up, or at least was dead.

Soon he was getting piled on by the vampires, but thanks to the special weapons and claws he had borrowed from Paul, he was able to scr.a.p.e their bodies off them, tearing them limb from limb. As the fairy blood entered their bodies, their movements slowed down greatly as well.

Logan, who now had his back leant up against the wall couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Peter was taking on an army of vampires all by himself, his weapons and clothes were soaked in blood, and it didn’t look like he was slowing down.

This was because of what Peter was. He was a Wight, someone who never tired or ran out of stamina, but had the strength of the one who had created him.

However, eventually a few vampires had gotten through Peter. Logan lifted up his arm and was ready to fire out his energy cannon at the one charging towards him, but he didn’t have to.

For one of the vampires that had been beaten at the beginning, had stopped the other vampire, as if it was a human meat shield being used just to protect Logan. Soon another one was standing by his side.

Logan understood what and who they were now, they were the lesser wight’s created by Peter. Even while fighting, Peter was going to keep his promise and protect Logan no matter what.

Seeing this, even though in pain, Logan felt like he needed to do his part. He had run out of the blood crystals given to him from earlier, but fighting against regular vampires they weren’t really needed that much.

Instead, he inserted the King tier crystals he had on him, and started to fire energy blasts at the vampires that would get past Peter or cause him the most trouble. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Soon after though, the vampires had eventually stopped, not because Remus had been killed, but because there were no longer any vampires in the area, that was after Logan. It was quite the sight to see, as in front of Peter and Logan, there were hundreds of dead vampires on the floor.

When it was finally over, Peter was seen kneeling over on the floor holding his stomach.

"Peter, what’s wrong?" Logan asked, but was still hurting from his own wounds. The reason why he was concerned was because Peter shouldn’t be tired. He didn’t have stamina like the others.

"I’m so hungry!" Peter shouted, and screamed as if someone was grabbing down into his stomach and trying to pull something out.

Of course Peter would be hungry. His body was constantly healing while he was fighting all of those vampires.

While Peter was lying there on the floor, for the first time Logan was seeing something happen to him he had never seen before. The wounds on his body that he got close to the end, they weren’t healing and they were opening slightly.

’Is this, because he hasn’t consumed human flesh.’

In front of his very eyes, Peter’s body was decomposing, his muscles tearing down in front of him.

Standing up, Logan started to move towards him, he wobbled as his legs were shaky, but used the spiders to reinforce his legs creating a small suit over them.

"Peter.."

"GET AWAY!" Peter screamed. "Do you know how hard it is for me right now not to attack you!"

It looked like Peter was fighting every urge in his body to eat human flesh, and unlike the last time. Logan had none on him to give to Peter.

"Peter, if you don’t eat something, it looks like your body will completely decompose and you will cease to exist." Logan explained. "I know you have a great healing ability, but there needs to be an energy source for that, and for you that energy source is human flesh. Luckily we have human flesh right here."

Placing one of the beast crystals into the top of his forearm, an energy blade was created from the palm of his hand and without hesitating, Logan sliced through his arm. It fell to the floor and quickly Logan used the end of the energy blade to sear the wound closed on his body.

He grunted, holding in the sheer pain he was feeling as the wound was burning up, but he needed to stop the bleeding, otherwise he would soon be dead.

"Take it!" Logan shouted. "Take it and live, Peter!"

Peter glanced at the arm that was on the floor for a second.

’What is this idiot doing? He isn’t a vampire, or a wight. If I eat his arm, it’s going to be gone forever. He will never get it back.’ However, the pain to fight what was in front of him was only getting stronger.

In the end, he closed his eyes, and started to bang his head against the floor. A few seconds later though, he felt something grab the back of his hair and lift his head up.

"Eat it Peter!" Logan said, shoving the arm into his mouth.

What happened after that, Peter couldn’t remember and had no clue, but when he regained consciousness, he could see that Logan was leant up against the wall and his own wounds had healed.

He walked up to Logan, and could hear the sound of him breathing. It was a relief for Peter, and he was glad that he hadn’t eaten any other part of Logan.

"You might just be the craziest person in the Cursed family." Peter said. "I will never forget this Logan, I promise. Everyone keeps protecting me, and I now have a lot of favours I need to return." Peter thought as he looked off into the distance, as he could feel something.

The connection in his body had activated, and even as far as they were, Peter could finally feel Quinn. He couldn’t feel him during the fight, but it looked like something had happened, that had awakened Quinn’s power.

"Quinn, I hope you can give that bitch everything she deserves!"
