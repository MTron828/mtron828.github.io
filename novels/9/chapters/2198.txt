The bright flash of white light could be seen from all over the city, and a few of them had seen this before. They remembered the last time they had seen such a thing, and in the back of their mind for a second they wondered, was it him?

Yes, how could it be, Quinn didn't know they were here, and he hadn't gone back to the Mermerial planet yet, besides, wouldn't he have arrived in a spaceship or something. In the end, Quinn didn't tell the others much of the details of what he was doing.

Who Mundus was, what he had asked, and what he was capable of? As soon as he appeared in the city, he looked around and could see the Amra everywhere. There were a few that were quite startled but they started to make faces as they were beginning to recognise him.

"Is that‚Ä¶ Why do I recognise that human's face? And how did he come from the sky?" One of them asked.

Running thorugh the city, Quinn was heading to the most likely location where Geo would be. Since he was no longer a celestial he was unable to clearly sense the energy inside him. Only when he was using it would he be able to somewhat pinpoint it.

'Let's not waste time, I need to try to find Geo as quickly as possible, he's their leader now, so he should be in the biggest or most central building, or he might be in the tower at the very back as well.'

Scanning, Quinn moved his head from side to side, and that's when he suddenly stopped for a few seconds as he looked at what was in front of him. Placing his hand on his forehead he started to shake.

'Why‚Ä¶. why everywhere I go, do they seem to like to build statues of me?' Quinn said. 'At first, I have to admit I found it a bit flattering, but seeing it here, even among aliens it's a bit embarrassing‚Ä¶ and why does it feel like it's honouring someone that is already dead‚Ä¶ I'm very much alive.'

Trying to ignore the statue, at least Quinn knew he was in the right place, and was on the right planet. Going around quickly he could eventually see the large manor, and thought that it was the best destination. Using his strong legs, Quinn leapt up, and jumped toward one of the windows.

Seconds before he was about to crash into the window, his body turned into shadow and using the shadow travel he went right through the wall and landed in the centre of the room. When he stood up from his bent position from landing he could see multiple eyes on him.

"That was quite the unexpected entrance." Russ said with his arms folded, looking unimpressed while the others found it hard to keep their mouths closed.

Quinn was like the boogeyman, one would say his name and then he suddenly appeared right in front of them.

"Daddy!" Minny called out as she ran forward and surprisingly, Galen had jumped out of Layla's hands as well, rushing toward his father. The two of them jumped up and Quinn caught them as they rubbed their cheeks against his chest.

"We missed you so much‚Ä¶ where did you suddenly go, why do you keep leaving us." Minny asked through sobbed tears, as usual.

Quinn wanted to answer but honestly he was left more confused as to what situation he had just ran into. He was turning his head looking at everyone in the room. For one, he was only expecting to see Geo, but everyone was here.

"What! Shiro as well, you were on the Amra planet, now my head is really starting to hurt. Why is everyone on the Amra planet, what happened‚Ä¶ did the Mermerials get attacked?" Quinn asked.

It looked like now was the time for the others to explain to him what had happened. They went through the details of the choices they had decided to make in order to help Quinn, and how it was a coincidence that the Blades were here.

He let them do the talking as to what happened since the Blades were here. Now it was all starting to make a bit more sense, but there was still one more piece of the puzzle that Quinn was confused about, and that was Jake and Vicky.

From the way they looked at him, it seemed as if their memories had been wiped as well, and there had to be a reason for that, which they explained, making Quinn's heart beat slightly faster.

"I see‚Ä¶ so its finally happening. It looks like they're coming and we don't have a lot of time. Thank you for coming all of this way. I'm sure you two have to head back as soon as possible in order to not cause any suspicion. The last thing I want to do is upset you guys and Logan after everything you have already done for me." Quinn stated.

It was true, and looking at each other they decided to set off, reminding them that they would help with the Sil situation.

"I'm sorry everyone for going away again, but I promise that this time it was for a good reason." Quinn stated.

"I think the plan you have made will mostly work, the problem is the ones fighting against Jim‚Ä¶ I want to be by your side, I want to help you when you rescue Sil, but I can't just leave the Amra and I think there is a bigger threat that I'll need to hold back.

"I will have to put my trust in you guys, in order to free Sil. While here, on this planet, I will try to cause a big distraction for them. So when the time is right, who knows, maybe Jack and the others will send all of their forces to me."

"But what if they change our memories and make you seem like you are one of our enemies." Geo asked.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

"I think it's best if I don't come in at the start of the war anyway. Most likely Jim won't use a strong force, or his trump card unless he's in trouble. In this war, I will make it appear as if I'm appearing as an outsider to help you out.

"Even if they do change your memories, I will be fighting against the enemy so I doubt it will change much, and besides‚Ä¶ I think there could be another problem."

Quinn didn't say it out loud, but 2 days it wasn't enough time. At first he was happy that he had arrived just before the war had started, but Alex had given him a reminder.

'The armour Quinn‚Ä¶ even if we can gather all the materials on this planet, and can use their forgery here‚Ä¶ we are dealing with five god slayer crystals. We will be lucky if the armour is done by the end of the war.' Alex stated.
