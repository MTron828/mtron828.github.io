Chapter 987 - Deadly kick

There was a difference in the VR game compared to the real world. When Quinn just didn’t want to deal with people, he could simply just log off. In the first place, Quinn had been playing the game non-stop for a while now. Although he was the type of person who could repeat the same task over and over again and not get sick of it, this session had gone on for a bit too long.

’Quinn, I’m a little confused. Why did you suddenly log off like that?’ Vincent asked as Quinn was getting out of the pod and giving his body a few stretches here and there. ’Wasn’t your whole goal to find someone good at martial arts to teach you. He was right there?’

’Don’t worry.’ Quinn replied as he exited the room and decided to head off to his own living quarters. ’I’ve already figured out what type of person the martial arts god is. That person won’t stop chasing me now until he gets what he wants. Even more so after what I just did, and I have an idea that just might rile him up even more.’

Once Quinn had entered his own room, he went to the desk that was placed in the corner. It looked plain as if there was nothing on it, but once he sat down, a holographic keyboard lit up in front of him, and a widescreen appeared in front of his eyes.

The first thing he did was search up videos about Muay Thai fighters. Quinn started to watch video after video on the subject. There were plenty of tutorials online, but it was safe to say that the martial arts god was leaps and bounds ahead of all of them.

It was a shame, but old traditional martial arts skills had diminished, especially since the introduction of abilities. Still, it had a bit of a resurgence based on other abilities, but new forms of martial arts were created to suit the beast weapons and take advantage of that power.

Very few people used their fists to fight. After watching some videos for some time, Quinn took what he wanted from them. Downloading them onto his little wristwatch, heading off to his own personal training room.

The videos that he had saved he played a few times while in the training room and slowly started to copy the moves bit by bit.

’Maybe there’s a method to his madness.’ Vincent thought as he watched him.

The fighting style was undoubtedly different from what Quinn was used to, and there were many points. The striking part wasn’t so hard. Throwing out punches, he did this enough, and he was also quite good with his kicks due to the military-style of fighting.

However, there was something different about the kicks in the video. The amount of weight and power was like that of a gigantic whip. The main movement he decided to focus on was the t.h.i.g.h kick. Having experienced it himself, he knew how effective it was.

The other points of fighting style, such as using the elbows, knees and grappling, were a little harder for him to grasp, without a fighting power, and just through a video, he couldn’t get the right feeling, as Fex would say.

Quinn went through each of the movements of the t.h.i.g.h kick slowly and made sure he was standing in the same stance as the person before him. He also remembered well the viewpoint of the martial arts god.

’Alright, let’s do this!’ Quinn said as he practised the kick over and over again.

While Sam was busy with his daily duties, he had heard about a complaint while being on board the ship. That there was a loud continuous bang. Worried that there might be some damage or something wrong with the ship, Sam had decided to go check out where the noise was coming from.

"Is there a reason you have brought me along?" Dennis asked as they walked towards the loud banging sound, which was getting louder, and had a standard beat to it.

"Haven’t you seen those alien movies?" Sam chuckled nervously. "Maybe a beast snuck on board the ship and slowly is starting to turn everyone or is running through the vents."

Although Dennis would have liked to poke fun at this, it seemed like Sam was genuinely scared, and everyone had their fears. Finally, they had located the noise of the bang, which had led them to outside a locked door.

"Isn’t this?" When opening up the door, another loud bang was heard, and a breeze was felt on both Sam’s and Dennis’ faces pulling their hair back a bit.

What they could see was Quinn drenched in sweat, so much so that there was a pool of water behind him, but he seemed incredibly focused, and his back right leg was all tensed up, that the veins were showing running up his calf like a root of a plant.

His leg was a foreign part of his body. Lifting it up, Quinn threw his leg and twisted his h.i.p.s as hard as he could and once again, the loud bang was heard.

Quinn was throwing out his leg so fast, with such force it sounded like when one would swing a real whip. Imagining what would happen to someone’s leg at the end of that, Sam gulped. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

"I think I’m ready," Quinn said with a smile, only noticing the two of them now.

"Why do I feel like something like his has happened before?" Sam said and left the room so Quinn could continue doing his own thing. An announcement was made so no one would worry about the banging noise anymore. He would also request Logan to attempt to make the room more soundproof in the future.

’You keep getting stronger, Quinn.’

——

The next day, when Quinn logged into the game again, he didn’t get a request from the martial arts god. When checking his status, it seemed like he was in his own fights, which was to be expected since the top rankings fought all the time. Still, Quinn wanted to get his attention another way.

Searching for a game after having come out of the hundred rankings, for the third time, he was matched up with someone familiar.

’This guy again!’ Chun thought as he saw who his opponent was. He had been having a good day. Since he was on a winning streak again, and from his calculations, he only needed to win one or two more games before entering the top hundred rankings.

’Okay, whatever. This time I’m going to be prepared for you.’ Chun thought

When the match started, Quinn decided to stay in position and just waited for Chun to make his move. He threw a few axes his way, but Quinn would avoid them.

’I know you have an ability, so I’m not going to do what I did the first time.’ Chun thought as he took out both axes from his back and held them in his hands.

’I’m quite skillful at using these bad boys in my hand!’ Chun thought, running forward, seeing that the Noob fighter was just staying in the same position.

With the first downward strike, Quinn flash stepped behind him, and the kick that he had been practising a thousand times was ready. He wasn’t at full strength due to the limiter set on his body, but everything felt the same. Coming out like a whip, his leg had hit the back of Chun’s t.h.i.g.h.

If it wasn’t a game, he felt like his bones would have been crushed, and the system deemed it so as well since he could no longer move. With him on his knees, as soon as Quinn’s leg was back in position, he let it fly out again, this time hitting Chun’s head.

[Winner ’Noob Fighter’]

After that kick, the match was over in an instant.

’Again! What the hell is wrong with that guy? He beat me twice now and two different ways!’ Chun screamed. ’He’s a curse, that guy is a curse, he shouldn’t be called a noob fighter, he should be called a Curse fighter or something!’ Chun continued to scream, but it was pointless.

’And what was that kick?’

Hoping to rub off some of his bad luck on the player, he decided to follow his matches, and what he proceeded to see next was a massacre.

The Noob fighter won his next four matches, only using mainly three moves. A flash step to avoid his opponent’s blow, a kick, and sometimes a punch or two, but they were used primarily for blocking.

Soon, Quinn found himself rising the ranks, reaching rank ninety, and had once again caught the attention of the martial arts god.

Vincent had been watching Quinn throughout the fights and was just wondering how quick he was able to progress. ’Quinn, I’ll say this again, even though you think you have no talent, I believe you always did. It’s just that you never had the body to quite show that talent.

’You have created a deadly kick without even realising it. Once you have finished and learnt these skills to their most potential, I can’t imagine how powerful they will be adding in the vampire aura and the Qi you have learnt as well.’ Vincent thought.

Finally, it was time for Quinn’s and the martial arts god’s rematch. At the same time, the name of the Noob fighter was starting to spread.

Inside his Office, Oscar was sitting down waiting for his daily reports.

"Hmm, what’s this? A report from Sergeant Chun?" Oscar said.

"Yes," Jade replied, standing by his side. "You know he likes to play the game of power fighters a lot to look for new recruits, and he says he has found a gem that goes by the name of Noob fighter."
