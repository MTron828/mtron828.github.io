After learning the reason why the Elder named Xoxy had come to visit, Layla was unable to shake off this uneasy feeling. Perhaps it was due to how many things had occurred surrounding them and the real important matter that Quinn was dealing with, but she just couldn't have someone related to a celestial walking around the place. 

A signal was made towards Muka and Xander, they were pulled to the side for a moment, while the Elders were inside a weapons shop admiring the craftsmanship and work.

"Do either of you mind keeping these Elders a bit busy. There's this uneasy feeling that I just can't shake off."

"I'll help you out." Muka said. "I'm guessing you're going to search for some information. I can get in touch with the others through the settlement."

Although Layla was part of the settlement, technically she wasn't in charge of anything. She wasn't a leader of the castles nor was she part of the meeting table. Unlike Muka, she wasn't able to freely contact and retrieve information. People would do as she asked due to the respect they had for her, but unless she was there in person, it would be quite difficult for others to just take her word.

Layla nodded at Muka and before Xander could say anything, the two of them were already off, heading back to the castle. 

"Ah!" Xander had his finger in the air. What the others were doing seemed a lot more exciting than showing a bunch of old men around. Turning around, he just sighed, as he saw one of the old men drop a dagger that nearly fell right through their foot.

Luckily, Xander used his speed to quickly grab onto the handle. 

"Please be careful." Xander said. "These weapons are quite sharp."

The old man just laughed it off as if it was nothing, while Xander was left thinking why was it always him that was left with this type of task, looking after people.

Returning to the castle, Muka had quickly called over her knights who were to use the telepathic communication ability to make contact with the vampires throughout the whole area. 

"That Elder named Xoxy, he was the only one that went off on his own. I want people to keep a lookout for him, tell me where he is currently." Layla asked. 

A virtual map was brought up in front of them of the large settlement and the many areas. Muka was communicating with the knights back and forth, and soon small indicators were coming up. 

These indicators on the map were the locations where Xoxy had been spotted. They were moving all over the place, as guards were giving reports as to where he went. 

Layla could somewhat understand just based on what she could hear from the corner of her ear, while also looking at the dots. She was following it with her eyes, and eventually saw it reach the school. 

'He went to visit the school… why would he go to visit the school?' Layla placed her finger on her chin. 'He kept asking about Quinn, and he is working for that Mermerial god… wait a moment, last time, weren't they after the kids as well. Could it be, is he there to get Minny!'

There was a panic, mainly because it looked like the dot was no longer moving on the map. The last place that they had seen Xox was at the school. 

"Muka, what is going on?" Layla asked. 

"It seems as though the last location of Xox was at the school. We have quite a few guards located at the school due to the incidents that happened in the past, ones that we are in direct contact with." Muka explained. "The thing is, they haven't been able to locate the elder anywhere. I have asked the guards to keep watch over him, but they don't even know where he is, it's as if he's vanished."

This news was even more worrying for Layla. At least if they kept an eye on him they could relax, but if he had vanished, did it mean he had already accomplished what he had come to do. 

"What about Minny, is she okay!" Layla said, as she was already grabbing a weapon from the table. It wasn't the black sword she had before but it was still a fine beast blade nonetheless.

"She's fine." Muka answered. "It was the first thing I asked. They say she is safe. The elder was seen leaving the school, but no one spotted him after that."

Still with the worry in her mind, Layla left heading for the school, but she wondered where had this elder disappeared to.

———

Inside the dark space, Xox was still confused as to what was going on. Where was he? It didn't feel like he was on the same world any longer. It almost felt similar to the celestial space, but it was completely different. 

"Is this your doing, little boy?" Xox asked with a smile. It was the only person in the space with him, so it was the logical conclusion for him to come to. 

"You!" Galen pointed. "Bad person, you stay here!"

The smile didn't drop from Xox's face, but he couldn't believe that he was getting a telling off right now, from a kid of all things.

"Look here you brat, do you even know who I am, I am a god." Xox explained. "A god is a person that is needed by the universe or is worshipped by many people. I'm not a bad person." 

"You follow my sister!" Galen replied back straight away. "You sneak, and change what you look like. You ask a lot of questions about my family. You are a bad person." 

After saying these words, Galen started to summon blood aura around his hands. It was powerful like a fire over his two fists.

"Your sister?" Xox repeated as he thought about the words from the young one. Yongbu had stated that there was also another child, a very young boy. Could this be the boy that he was talking about? 

If it was his sister, then it meant that they were talking about his daughter as well.

'Crap, I'm not the best when it comes to fighting.' Xox thought. 'But I should at least be able to take on a kid right?' 

Right in front of his eyes though, Galen had disappeared, and before he knew it, he was right by the side of his head. With a fist full of blood aura, he was hit on the side and sent flying across the room, skidding across the dark floor. 

"SH***T, THAT HURT!" Xox screamed at the top of his lungs. 

Xox's particular race didn't have any fighting powers apart from transforming into others, changing his appearance. Even if he changed into some type of beast it would be in appearance only. Sure, he could make his body have multiple limbs but it would just have his strength and nothing else, so it was practically useless in this type of situation, but there was always one trump card celestials always had when they were going up against other beings. 

"Don't say I didn't warn you. There is a reason why I am a god, and you are nothing!" Xox said, as his hands started to glow with white energy. It shot out of his palms like a bright light. 

Celestial energy had a special effect being more powerful than typical auras. The best way to fight celestial energy was with other celestial energy, otherwise one would have to have an aura several times more powerful than the celestial energy to match up with it.

This was why it wasn't impossible to kill celestials, but it was an incredibly hard thing to do, especially if one had a lot of celestial energy. 

The red celestial energy started to gather in Galen's hands even more. Placing it out in front of him, he took the blow well. He pushed the energy and the white energy clashed against his hands but it was extremely powerful. 

His small body was being pushed back, and so was his blood aura, it was starting to fade more and more, consuming it up. 

"Arghhh!" Galen shouted out. His body started to glow, but it wasn't red, instead it started to glow slightly white in colour.

"This is… this is impossible." Xox said. 

The next moment, the entirety of Galen's body was glowing with white energy, it came out from the palm of his hands and completely evaporated the energy that Xox had produced. 

"You…. how can you have celestial energy, when you're not a celestial?" Xox asked.
