Sil gripped the handle of his weapon tightly before bringing his other hand over, holding the large sword with both of his hands. His feet shuffled on the ground, kicking up a small part of the dust, and then he charged in.

Rushing in, he wasn't alone; the Black Swordsman was by his side, only a step or two behind him. He was fast as well, just Sil was faster, but it didn't matter because he saw what was going to take place.

Immortui lifted his hand and struck down with the red mist aura from above. He wasn't close to them, but almost a giant hand had been made from the aura, planning to slam them down.

Sil had already stepped to the side, avoiding the blow, while the Black Swordsman slashed above, touching the hand and getting rid of it completely. Sil boosted himself with speed, adding lightning in his steps.

It was a technique used by the Graylash family to try and match up to those that were fast, and combining it with super speed, Sil could place himself right under Immortui, and he knew it was going to work.

A large slash from the side hit across his chest. The sword slashed with large sparks of lightning hitting Immortui's body. He quickly swiveled around him before he could react and struck at his back.

As Immortui swung his arm, another giant fist of red aura appeared but had hit nothing. Before he could turn around, the Black Swordsman was now the one that was in front of him. He slashed four times across his chest, and each one broke through the red mist that acted as protection. The sword cut his chest, and blood was being spilt by Immortui. With anger, he lifted up his feet and slammed them on the ground. The aura covering them made it look like the feet of the giants were being used.

"Move!" Sil shouted.

The two of them backed away, and the whole area around Immortui, like a waterfall, crashed down with the red power. The floor was cracking, and power seeping through it, but none of it had managed to touch the two.

Immediately after finishing his attack, lightning bolts came out from the side, and they were hitting Immortui's body constantly; he had no choice but to allow the armour skin to cover his whole body.

As it did, Sil had come in again, jumping this time with a large strike from above. Lifting his own forearm, Immortui had blocked the strike from Sil, but at the same time, the Black Swordsman had swung his sword from below.

The Black Swordsman might not have been as fast as Sil, but due to his great experience in swordsmanship, he was able to know when the right time to strike was. The sword was coming close to Immortui's body when the serpent on his shoulder opened its mouth and bit down on the sword, stopping it in its tracks.

Immortui then swung his arm, overpowering Sil's sword strike and pushing him slightly to the edge; when he landed on the ground, he knew the outcome. The clones had already come in; they had teleported close and had struck at Immortui's side with a lightning fist. It was explosive power with a pulse of lightning shooting out in the air.

The look on Immortui's face showed that the attack had done next to nothing to him, though. From his strange armour that covered his body, it started to move, and more serpents were appearing. They came out with their mouths open and bit on the clones, making them disappear on the spot.

The serpents were smaller in size compared to the two large ones that dangled over his shoulder, but they were fast and had to have packed a relatively strong force if they got rid of the clones.

One of the larger serpents was still holding onto the Black Swordsman's sword. Turning around, Immortui went to throw a fist to its stomach, until Sil had managed to get there just in time, swinging and blocking the strike with his large sword.

The two were at it again, swinging the sword. Sil would swing with his strength and speed, some hits being blocked by Immortui, while a few got through to his body. Hitting his side, his ribs, and legs.

Then the Black Swordsman would come in as well, in between the strikes, but these ones had all been blocked by Immortui's forearm, no longer leaving a scratch on his body.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

"It's been a long time since I've had to fight so close with my body like this," Immortui exclaimed. "This is good, this is good practice for when I go against them. I'm starting to warm up a little."

Sil could tell that Immortui wasn't lying, as he saw more ahead, he could see that none of his strikes would get through to Immortui, his or the Black Swordsman.

"Jump!" Sil shouted.

He could see a strong power gathering in his hand, and Immortui had swung it out like a large slap. Both the Black Swordsman and Sil jumped. The two of them thought it was a direct attack aimed at them.

Sil had seen it was a direct attack, but he had failed to see the outcome of the attack. Having swung his hand, a large red hand made from the mist had appeared as well and had hit a large portion of the clone Sils that would interrupt in the fight now and then. They disappeared as soon as the hand made contact with them.

There were now only a few left, and Sil was trying to think about what to do next.

"You are rushing things," Immortui said. "I can feel it in your strikes. You aren't thinking but just trying to attack. If you were thinking you would have seen the truth behind that attack, and not just the attack itself.

"But why are you rushing? Why are you trying so hard to get rid of me so fast?" Immortui smiled, knowing the answer. "You're running out of power, aren't you? To be able to do all of these things, there has to be a limit to your energy.

"After all, you are not like me, you are no god! Your energy is nowhere near close to mine. To beat you, all I need to do is wait."

Hearing that was good news for Sil because in the first place, all he wanted to do was buy time.

"What the…" Sil's eyes for a moment gazed away from Immortui as he saw something strange happening in the space above them. It wasn't just him though; Immortui could also see strange things happening in the space, in the sky behind him as well.

Both of them had lost all focus on each other in the fight, as they were witnessing white glowing portals appearing all over the place. Not just where they were, but they were appearing all over the universe on each and every single one of the planets.

From one of the portals close, flying right through the portals were large beings, with wings on their back, holding spears in their hands. Some covered in a type of golden glowing armour, while the others covered in a strange dark black substance.

"It's the Divine Brigade," Immortui said, every muscle in his body tensed up. "Celestalon, the Ancient One, is attacking us."
