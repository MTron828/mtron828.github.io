Chapter 1222 The end of the Blade family

Sil, Borden, Raten and Vorden had all decided to move out from the original area where they had fought. Heading inside to one of the large buildings that seemed to act as a type of hotel. Although they didn't really use it to hide and instead were just waiting in the entranceway.

The suggestion had been raised by Vorden because there was something serious the group needed to decide, and he wasn't quite sure that Sil was in the right mind to choose. On the floor, behind the desk, Borden was keeping an eye on them. Both Pai and Vicky passed out on the floor.

"We need to decide what to do with them?" Vorden asked.

"What do you mean?" Raten replied. "If they wake up, you don't think they're going to try and fight us again. I think it's obvious what we need to do."

Even without asking, Vorden knew what Raten's suggestion was going to be, so instead, he was looking towards Sil for support. Still, he seemed to have something else on his mind, and Borden, although he had some connection to all of them, didn't really to Pai and Vicky.

"Do you really think they would continue to fight us even if Hilston is taken out of the picture? I can tell that they are just following his orders, and it isn't something they want to do." Vorden argued.

"Even if that was the case, you said it yourself, if Hilston is taken out of the picture," Raten replied.ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

The one thing Vorden wanted more than anything was time because Vorden had a feeling that after today, the Blade family would be different altogether, but soon Pai and Vicky would wake up again. They couldn't just keep fighting against them and knocking them out.

"I don't care what you do with them, Vorden. You can do what you want, but I need to go and get Hilston. Borden met up with mother, I met with father, which means the one that had met up with him was Peter, and I haven't been able to find him." Sil finally spoke, and it looked like he was ready to leave.

"Wait!" A female voice shouted, but in an instant, Borden had his hand around her throat, gripping tightly.

"I have strength beyond what you could imagine. If you try anything, then I will squeeze, and it will be the end of your life." Borden warned, and he even applied a little bit of pressure to show he wasn't joking.

The one who had called out was Vicky. She had regained consciousness a while ago and was listening in to the others to hear what they were planning to do. She wasn't stupid. The loss that she suffered before was because of Sil, and he could easily beat them again. Which was why she was waiting for him to leave.

However, she had heard something, and she wanted to confirm it herself.

'Why‚Ä¶is that a Dalki body? And this person, they look a bit like Sil? Who are they?' She thought.

One thing was sure, unlike the others that might have had some sort of troubled feelings for her, this one did not.

"I‚Ä¶I.just wanted to ask what happened to mother and father?" Vicky asked.

"They already left," Sil replied, continuing to look out of the entrance to see what was happening. "I left the ship a little later compared to the others. I thought the two of them might try to help Hilston in some way, and I would try to stop them, but then I saw that the two of them decided to take off into the desert, running off to who knows where."

Hearing this, Vicky's face was showing a hint of sadness and anger. Soon it started to change as she didn't really know what to feel.

"Vicky, you know they probably ran away to get away from all this mess, right?" Vorden said. "I mean, that island isn't normal. Look what happened to us. We are now in bodies that we don't even own, and all of this started because of him.

"Do you really think anyone would truly stay by Hilston's side if it wasn't for his power? I even saw some of the Chained doing the same thing. Rather than chasing after us or the Dalki, they ran into the desert."

There was no reply from Vicky, so Vorden didn't really know what was going through her mind at the moment, but one thing was clear, she no longer had the will to fight. Even Borden seeing this, had let go of her neck, and she just stayed in place doing nothing.

'Vicky has always been a hard one to get through to. Maybe the easy one to talk to would be Pai, whenever he wakes up.' Vorden thought.

"Sil, I don't think Peter is with Hilston at the moment," Vorden said. "If Peter was ever in any type of serious danger, or his life was nearly lost, then Quinn would be there to save him. On top of that, rather than going after Hilston, we need to make sure everyone else is okay. Where is even that kid that follows you all the time, the one that helped us, Shiro." Vorden said.

For the first time, Sil's eyes seemed to come to life as he turned his head, to look at the others. In his blinded thoughts of Hilston, he had forgotten entirely about Shiro.

"We have to- "

Interrupting his sentence was a loud bang that was in the centre of the Shelter. They all soon came rushing out of the hotel lobby to see what exactly was going on. Borden carried Pai over his back.

The explosions didn't just stop once though, they continued to go on and on. It was clear signs of fighting were going on in the centre, and it wasn't just between a single Dalki and those from the Cursed faction.

"Maybe the others are in trouble. We have to go!" Vorden shouted out, and they started running towards the sounds. Soon though, Vorden stopped to turn around as he could see Vicky standing there.

"Come on, you come as well," Vorden said, grabbing her by the hand and running along with everyone else.

‚Äî‚Äî

The landscape of the centre of the Shelter had wholly changed. The buildings were no more as nearly all of them had been reduced to rubble from the fighting. Those who were currently there and still fighting, it was a group of ten Dalki.

Nine of them had two spikes, and one in the centre with the biggest grin on its face was a four spiked Dalki, named Patch. A nickname given to him due to the different coloured patches he had all over his body.

Usually, a Dalki would mostly be black in colour, but he had lighter shades on his body, making him look somewhat like a cow.

There were around three Dalki that had been killed on the floor around him, but Patch didn't seem to care, for he knew that the people responsible would soon meet their end.

"Guys, let's just get out of here. You two can't fight anymore!" Megan shouted as she looked at a badly beaten Dennis. One of his arms was broken. The socket of his left eye had been smashed as well, so he was unable to keep it open.

"She's right!" Shiro shouted. "You used up the blood in your flasks, and our powers can't help you guys. We have to go!"

"You don't understand. We can't leave this area!" Fex shouted back. He, too, was badly injured, but more so internally. Having taken one punch from Patch.

'That four spiked Dlaki, even after using the blood net, his punch still hit me and broke a few of my ribs.' Fex thought.

As for the reason why they couldn't leave the area, Dennis and Fex could smell it. Those in the cursed faction were hiding in the houses, through the streets in the areas not too far from them. If they left, the Dalki would soon spot them and kill them all.

"This cow like Dalki! He's a four spike. He has to be the strongest in the area. If we just get rid of him, we can rest!" Fex shouted, trying to give himself more energy.

"Hahah, me the strongest!" Patch started to laugh along with the others behind him. "If you truly believe that, then there was never hope for you all at the beginning. Right now, it looks like she has found someone she is enjoying her time with, and it's our job to make sure she isn't distracted."

"Are you talking about Dalki fighting against Hilston?" A voice said from behind. "Because we will get rid of them both."

When turning around, Fex had never been happier to see the crazy boy and the rest of them. Sil had arrived with the others by his side, and they were ready to cause a splash.

"I'm sorry, but I would like to request that I deal with this one." Another voice said. It sounded familiar yet unfamiliar to a lot of them there.

Breaking out of the Shadows, they could see his dark black hair and two gauntlets covering his arms.

"You will need to keep as many MC cells as you can for the big bad wolf. Otherwise, the pig's house will get blown down." Vincent said. "Wait a second, do they still tell that story at this time? I guess no one understands my references anymore.

"Just we're going to need you, so I'll take care of this one. I just need you guys to make sure that the other little minions don't get in the way."

"I'm already on it!" Another shouted from behind as his fist hit the Dalki straight in the stomach and sent it flying through the air. It was strength they hadn't seen before. Thinking about who it could possibly be, they could only imagine one person who was crazy enough to start fighting on their own before the others got involved.

"Screw you all!" Peter screamed. "I just need to get one punch in. Let me punch that old man just once!" Peter shouted in anger.
