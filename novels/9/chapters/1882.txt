Chapter Ôªø1883 Make me the best (Part 1)

Once again, since there was a new person in the group that had slept for a long time, they needed to be caught up on everything. Thankfully, Logan had a solution where it wasn't necessarily needed for them all to talk together again.

For a case like this, he had recorded their conversation from earlier, and at the moment, Alex was watching all of it. At the same time, he had asked for a pad and paper, that way he could write down notes of what had occurred while he was in a deep sleep.

[Quest complete]

[Find and wake up the Blood fairy Alex Way]

[+ 10,000 Celestial points]

Quinn had almost forgotten about this quest he had received a while ago, and in truth, he didn't really see it as a quest because it was something that he just wanted to do. Still, he wouldn't complain about getting these rewards especially since he had plans to use more of his celestial energy.

[New quest received]

[Get Forger 'Alex Way' to create a weapon using a god slayer crystal]

'A godslayer crystal, like the crystal the shadow came from... but do all god slayers drop crystals? Or is it only beasts that are deemed to be at the level of a god slayer that drop crystals? Either way, this new type of crystal could change everything... but I don't have the time to go looking for god slayers right now.'

It made Quin wonder as well, if the weapon Layla used was then classified as a god slayer weapon. Although it seemed more so like a god slayer's soul had been into the weapon along with its power, it did contain one of the strongest abilities Quinn knew.

The power to negate anything it touched, it was part of the reason why they were able to defeat the demon tier dragon in the first place.

"I think it would be best if I was to go," Layla stated while everyone was waiting around. "Sil, thank you for bringing me to Quinn. I mean it. It's been a long time and this meeting is something that I will never be able to forget."

Saying those words, her horns started to light up slightly red in the process.

"However, I know Quinn is busy, and the Red Vampires won't be safe until Erin is dealt with. Which is why I need to return to them.

"Sil, if possible, would you be able to take me back?"

Sil nooded, and before Layla was to return to the red vampires, she had walked up to Quinn.

"Whatever happens to Erin, I believe you will make the right decision about what to do, Quinn. I know you have a good heart and I know you would have tried your best. Just don't get yourself killed, because, at the end of the day, you are the most important person to me."

With that, she went and hugged Quinn tightly, and he had done the same to her.

"When this is over, I will come and visit you and I'm telling you now, I don't plan for this to take a long time."

With that said, Sil opened up a portal returning Layla to where she had come from and for himself to return shortly after. It was only around 30 minutes later that Alex was finally done catching up with everything.

"I can't believe all of that stuff happened. Quinn, I really can't imagine how it is to live a life in your shoes," Alex stated, moving his arms up and down. "Honestly, the two of us were close to each other in age, and although a lot has happened to me, it's nowhere near on the level as what is happening to you."

Shaking his head, Alex tried to get himself out of that mood, and his wings started to quickly flap about again.

"Anyway, I will create whatever you want, do you have anything in mind?" Alex asked.

As soon as Alex said that Quinn opened up his shadow and on the floor several items started to appear. First, there was the destroyed Blue Fang set.

"This was destroyed in a fight, and if we can, I would like to have it repaired," Quinn asked in a pained voice, and Chris, the person who had destroyed it, was looking away. "When repairing it, or with the new set of items I want to try two things.

"I have the ability to mark weapons and give them power, that is, after they have been made. Just like I did with Layla's weapon. I would like to mark the weapons after that, but during the repair and making process I want you to use part of my blood to make the weapons as well."

When Quinn extracted the blood from his body, it was the easiest way for him to use his celestial energy in the form of a power that would work on not just celestials, but others as well.

On top of that, Quinn was hoping for something else as well. Although hardening his own blood and creating a blood armour did help him, it was an alternative to his normal armour, due to his normal armour disintegrating when using celestial blood energy.

The problem was, he would also lose HP points when using his blood in this way leaving him less to use offensively. Hopefully, using his blood to create the weapons would stop, or at least lessen, his own energy causing the weapons and armour to disintegrate.

"I can see what I can do. I got used to mixing my own blood in with items so it should be okay. The only thing is, to repair a demon tier level of equipment I would need another demon tier crystal, to begin with." Alex explained. "It's why most people don't bother going through with repairs since they would rather use the crystal to make something else. Are you sure you want to do this?"

"I'm sure, this armour means a lot to me." Quinn replied instantly. Although he now had set his heart on someone else, there was still someone that he could never forget. This armour was his last link to her.

Quinn also wanted to put a marking on his demon tier chest piece, although the effects of the demon tier were nice and it didn't take up MC points for each attack he blocked.

With the current enemies he was facing, they were either faster than he could use his wings, or he would have to use shadow overload anyway to block the attacks, therefore eating into his MC.

There was a big risk, when marking an item or a weapon, that it would lose its active skills, but Quinn also was betting on the fact that it might become something that was more useful to him as well.

"I... also want a demon tier weapon as well." Quinn requested. "Made in the same way as the armour. I know you're limited to what the crystal can be used for but I also know that you will do a good job."

There was adrenaline running through Alex already, he had only just woken up, and he was being told to make universe changing items. There was no forger in the entire universe that he felt was more lucky than him in the current situation they were in.

"So um... I can do all this, but I am going to need some crystals."

In total, they would need at least two demon tier crystals for the items to be made, but at the same time, they wanted to go searching for Zero and Erin.

"Let me do the searching." Chris said. "I know the areas where Zero will be. I won't engage with him. I'm not foolish enough to think that I can do this without you. When I know where he is, I'll contact you straight away.

"In the meantime, you concentrate on getting what you need for those weapons. You're going to need them." Chris said.

After fighting with Chris and knowing his strength, it did make Quinn wonder just how strong was Zero?

"Maybe we don't have to wait long." Logan smiled. "That energetic son of mine, has already been out hunting."
