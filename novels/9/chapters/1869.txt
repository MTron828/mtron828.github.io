Chapter 1870 Re: Return of a legend (Part 2)

The others were in such disbelief when they saw the person in front of them that they thought they were dreaming. Quinn had gone missing for a while now, long enough that they assumed it might be years for him to return.

Or, if they really wanted to find Quinn, then they would have to find him himself. The only thing was, they had no idea how determined Quinn was to get back to Earth and return to the others to see if they were okay.

When Quinn saw the large ship, he had no clue what it was or who it belonged to, but he could sense that Peter was using his celestial energy now. The amount used was increased, and without a doubt, he was fighting.

Because of this, he didn't slow down as he busted through the many levels of the ship, following the energy like a red arrow. Quinn used his red aura to easily bash through the levels one by one until he eventually landed in front of the others.

'My guess was right, they're here, and it looks like they're in the middle of a tough battle.' Quinn thought as he could see Peter had transformed. And then he turned around, only to find partially-transformed Chris.

'This has to be related to Pure. So they were fighting against Chris up till this moment?' Quinn wondered. 'It seems like he's going easy on them since this is not his full transformation. Last time, I struggled, but I have been through a lot compared to that, and this time, the outcome won't be the same.'

Immediately, shadows covered both of Quinn's wings, turning into solid forms. At the same time, he activated his soul weapon, and the twin chains caused blood to trickle down his forearms. As the blood dropped on the floor, Quinn wasn't letting it go to waste.

While keeping the chest piece on, he started to harden the celestial blood that was oozing out of his body. He created a pair of leg pieces that turned and twirled, looking like an image of a ram's horns on his knees.

He also created shoulder pads in a similar fashion, having the indentation of flags on both of them. Then finally, the soul weapons themselves started to glow a bright red, changing their form into the deadly gauntlets he had used.

'He has the power of a Werewolf in him. Their physical strength is great. I could fight him at a distance using my blood skills and more, but I don't need to do that, and it's a lot more satisfying throwing out a punch.'

Using his blood control and his speed to the max, Quinn moved his body as fast as he could to where Chris was standing. Following Quinn was a red aura that was so large that it encased the entire room. And the others felt a chill as they sensed the massive amounts of energy.

Quinn's fist landed right on Chris's chest, and he could no longer be seen, instead, there was a large ceiling, around ten metres tall and ten metres wide, right above where he once stood. Upon looking through the hole though, one could see the sky, as the attack had gone right through the entire ship.

'I'm learning how to use my celestial power to power myself up even more.' Quinn thought. 'But I still have a number of things I have yet to try out. The reason why I thought for so long, and trained so hard, was because of this. I don't want my enemies to hurt those I care about ever again!'

"That won't be enough to kill him. He's a god slayer after all." Quinn said as he flew through the whole off in the distance.

Flying through the air, Chris was eventually descending, and there was a large fist mark on his body, and the internal wound had injured him as blood split from his mouth.

'That really hurt‚Ä¶ he's gotten so much stronger in such a short amount of time. But I should expect no less from someone like him.' Chris thought.

Turning his head, he could see a small island that was mostly rocks and void of plant life and more. Just before he landed, Chris's entire body began to change. His snout grew slightly larger, his teeth started to elongate, grey fur covered him from head to toe, and his huge build had turned even more muscular.

The internal wounds inside of his body were starting to heal. Finally landing and skidding across the surface, Chris had fully transformed himself, and he could see something coming toward him in the distance.

As it got closer, he could make out that it was. It was a giant red blood spear. Chris instantly started to run forward on all fours, and just as the spear was about to hit him, he leapt up in the air and grabbed it.

Immediately, he felt intense pain in his hands, and the veins all over his body began to tense. Then spinning around, Chris threw the red spear back, right where it came from.

"It looks like you're not here to talk this time," Chris said.

"You're right." He heard a reply from above, and upon raising his head, he saw a shadow portal. Quinn suddenly came out of it and threw his fist. He slammed Chris's head right into the ground, making the whole island tremble. "I'm not."

Back in the laboratory, the others were in shock and still at a loss for words at what had exactly occurred. They had seen Quinn appear out of nowhere, and then suddenly, he had disappeared like that. It was almost as if the whole thing was a dream.

"Oh‚Ä¶ what's this? You look a bit different from the last time I saw you?" Sil said, and this was directed toward Peter mainly.ReùíÇùíÇd the latest stories ùíên novùíÜlbin(.)com

It took a while as Peter looked at the person who was speaking, the one that had come with Quinn. The face instantly reminded him of someone, Hilston, but that was impossible, and they didn't look exactly like each other. There were just many similarities.

"I see you are struggling to remember, but it's Sil." Sil smiled. "I never did get to thank you in person for the items you helped me back then, Peter. I was a different person back then."

Peter was so speechless that he cancelled his transformation then and there. He walked closer, wondering what circumstances could have occurred that led Sil, the person in front of him, to be with Quinn, the one they were looking for.

"I don't understand how‚Ä¶how are you here, and how did you find Quinn?" Peter asked.

A lot of the others were interested as well and wanted to know his story, but they could soon hear footsteps and people shouting while heading their way.

"I would love to tell you all and introduce myself to Quinn's new friends. However, it looks like you guys were a bit busy here." Sil said. "Maybe we should get rid of this problem first before we get rid of the other problem."

Hearing this, everyone snapped back into reality.

"Wait!" Jessica shouted. "What about Quinn?"

"Oh, you don't have to worry about him," Sil replied. "He is an even bigger monster than he was before, compared to when you last met him. I doubt there is anyone on Earth that could take him on."

Muka began to shake her head at the situation.

"That's not the problem," Muka replied. "Chris, the one that Quinn is fighting, has just agreed to join our side. He was helping us, not fighting us."

A large smile appeared on Seal's face. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.

"That's quite funny, it looks like he's doing the same thing as me, and he was the one who called me hot-headed. Anyway, don't worry, it will all work out‚Ä¶I hope."
