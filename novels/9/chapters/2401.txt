The situation wasn't completely hopeless for the Chrono, as Hikel was noticing a change in their actions and the way that they fought. For one, their eyes were adjusting to the dark.

The Werewolves' eyes glowed slightly, allowing them to see where they were, and they weren't exactly the quietest of creatures either. With this, they knew their position, but more so what the Chrono were able to do now was to get in their own position.

They had formed groups, getting in a circle and covering each other's backs. They also made sure to stay away from the walls. The Werewolves were able to scale the walls with ease, while also bouncing off them to create a bigger attack.

It was smart of the Chrono; they were higher in numbers, and they weren't weak with their weapons. Fighting like this, they were able to fight back.

'When I watch them in this situation, it's clear that they have been through this before,' Hikel thought. 'The Chrono, they knew that when the sun set this hell would descend upon them, which also means some of them survived this.'

Some of the Chrono were incredibly skillful, one with two daggers, and sliced the chest of a Werewolf multiple times while blocking the claws from hitting his allies. Still, there were two big issues.

The strikes weren't enough to kill the Werewolves, allowing them to just heal away. Hikel knew there was another big issue as well, their almost unlimited stamina, which would allow them to fight at full strength from beginning to end. Making Hikel wonder when this would all stop.

A Werewolf had attempted to grab Hikel who managed to duck down, gathering the aura in his hand, he made a mini drill. Now with absolute blood control, he could control blood to a greater degree and he was taking a leaf out of Quinn's book.

Shoving his fist forward towards the chest, the blood spun, breaking through the tough skin of the Werewolf.

'I am not just any vampire, I am a vampire original!' Hikel burst into the chest and when his hand was on the inside, he used his explosive power right next to the Werewolf's heart.

It was a small but powerful explosion on the side that destroyed the heart, causing the body's muscles to go limp. Pulling his hand out, the Werewolf's body fell to the floor.

'That's one down, but that Werewolf was a bit wilder compared to the others I've been watching. It won't be that easy.'

There was another thing that Hikel noticed as well, which allowed him to fight one of the Werewolves on their own, and that was that the others were waiting. After killing the Chrono, rather than going to the next for the kill, they immediately went to feast on those that they had just killed.

Using their large teeth and mouths, they were eating at a fast rate, and when most of the body was eaten, their eyes looked as if they bulged a bit more, along with their muscles growing slightly bigger before residing back down again.

The other Chrono's didn't dare attack because their aim wasn't trying to kill all of the Werewolves, but just trying to survive.

The group had spread out in the large area, and elsewhere, Chris had also had his run-in with one of the Werewolves. Its two large claws swung at Chris, who was able to avoid them, then throwing out a fist he used the third stage of Qi.

It hit the Wolf in the chest, but hardly moved it back at all. 'They have great physical strength just like me, am I really going to have to face them with everything I have!' Chris thought, as he reached out and grabbed onto the wrist of the Werewolf.

His muscles were bulging, the veins could be seen going through his body, and the Qi was surging from within.

'If I change into my own Werewolf form in front of all of these Chrono, then they're going to start attacking me as well, and besides, I need to prove I'm a lot stronger than these guys!'

Chris pulled in the Werewolf instead of pushing away, and when he did he lifted his leg and kicked it right in the stomach. Letting go of the Werewolf's wrist, it went flying and crashing into the side of the cave wall.

"That's not going to be enough to kill it," one of the Chrono's said, as he handed Chris a big curved weapon. It was gigantic and nearly as big as him, but with his size and strength, it was easy for him to hold it.I think you should take a look at

Surprisingly, the Chrono seemed to have no problem holding it as well, but was using his own weapon, a spear.

"Thanks," Chris said.

Behind him, there were a group of five Chrono, one of them was badly hurt, having a big cut on his arm, a claw mark that had ripped through the muscle, but he was still standing and fighting.

Another Werewolf had come toward them; seeing this, Chris shielded the weapon with both of his hands, he drew power from the weapon, while also adding his own Qi into the weapon, and with all his strength, he swung the blade.

The Werewolf still managed to react quickly, using its claws to clash with the bladed part of the blade. The strength, though, was also too much for the Werewolf as it too went flying off into the distance, crashing into another part of the wall.

The Chrono were stunned by the strength of the stranger and even gave a thumbs up.

"It's good to know that there is someone strong with us this time," one of the Chrono smiled.

"So what's going on, why are these attacking us, and how do we get rid of them all?" Chris asked. He could see that Hikel hadn't used his full power yet, and until he did, he wouldn't either.

"...it's your first time going through this, right? What is going on, I think you can see for yourself. These creatures are what we have had to deal with every night. Sometimes more of us get added, like you, to increase our numbers but that doesn't help the situation anyway.

"You see, these demons, they eat us after killing us, allowing them to grow stronger. So every day we survive, the next day is even harder for us. So when you say get rid of them, that seems like an impossible task, we just need to survive until they go back up," a Chrono answered.

"And when is that?" Chris asked.

"When the sun rises again."

The answer was somewhat expected; he was just hoping that wasn't the case. In this single night, how many would survive, how many had already died in the first few minutes, and how many more would?

Now he could see why the Chrono called this hell. Looking around, though, Chris was looking for a particular person, but they were nowhere to be found.

'Where the heck is Russ?'
