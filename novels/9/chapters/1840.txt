Chapter 1841: Legendary BB.

Everyone at the scene was so stunned by the actions they were seeing that they had stepped out of their homes and the shelter they were hiding behind. Some of them even rubbed their eyes and pinched themselves, but without a doubt, they weren't dreaming.

The one that was currently bowing down on the ground was a God. Not just any god, but one who looked like a Fishman from the Meremerial race. They knew quite a bit about this God and their powers as their history books have described him well.

He was a powerful being who helped the Meremerial race in tough times, helping the predators of the sea. However, in recent times, he hadn't been seen during the divide, and he had slowly become more of a rumour over the years.

The only thing was, it was clear he was real. Someone had been giving the current predators of today their powers. No one knew whether it was the old God or not, but when they saw him, they knew everything was true.

Something inside their bodies was shaking as they felt his power, so why...why was this powerful and mighty God now bowing down in front of these outsiders? It didn't make any sense.

The thing was, in all honesty, Quinn was also confused by what was happening right now.

"This is a Celestial. I can tell by their energy, but why are they acting like this? I haven't seen this person before." Quinn thought, trying to remember.

"Yongu!" Yanny shouted by his side. He was nervous while looking back and forth between Quinn and his God. "What are you doing? Yongu should not be on your knees! Instead, you should use your great power to eliminate these invaders!"

"You yourself said you would get rid of anyone who came an..." In the middle of his sentence, Yongu stood up and clutched Yanny by his mouth, making him shut up.

"If you dare say another word, I will ensure you never live to see another day. I will not lose my life because of you." A surge of power was brewing all over Yongu as he said this.

His grip let go, and Yanny fell to the ground on his backside. He was so filled with fear that he couldn't even move because he knew that this God could take him out in an instant, which was why it was even more confusing for him that the latter was kneeling on the ground.

Looking at Quinn, he couldn't sense the same amount of energy out of him. This was because Quinn, of course, had his Celestial energy internally and wasn't using it at the moment.

"What do you think we should do?" Sil asked, peeking at the God who had gone to kneel again, almost instantly after dealing with Yanny.

"It's the God-slayer... I was pretty sure it was you, BB, but now that you are with the god slayer, I can confirm you are indeed BB." Yongu stated.

Listening to what this Celestial was saying, Quinn was trying to piece things together. The only ones that knew Quinn as BB were from Celestial Space. Was it from his fight with Athos? Was this celestial one of them that had seen him?

"Quinn." Princess said as she walked forward. "Who are you? How did you make him do something like this?"

"Please!" Yanny finally got the nerve to shout out again. He was in a desperate situation, His last trump card was now not working, and he felt like there had to be some type of mistake. "Explain why you won't fight these two."

For a second, Yongu turned around and glared at Yanny again, but he kept his head down and stayed in his position out of respect for Celestial 'BB' in front of him.

"BB is a god that has been banned from the Celestial Space." Yongu gulped before he went on to the following sentence.

"He is the one that has decided to go against us, against our ways, and fought hundreds of gods at once. Defeating many of them... including me."

Audible gasps spread throughout the crowds. Although they didn't quite know what was going on, without a doubt, the words they heard were impressive. It sounded almost impossible.

Wince's eyes widened, and her hands trembled.

She recalled their conversation at the bar when Quinn claimed to be a God. Although she had used that phrase to describe him a few times, she never meant it in a literal sense, and now she learnt that not only was he telling the truth, but he was perhaps beyond a conventional God.

"Yongu told me about that rampage you went on, but I didn't realise it had this much effect," Sil whispered with his hand covering his mouth.

The truth was, even Quinn didn't know the chaos he had triggered. It was out of anger and desperation that he had done such an act. He never thought that his real-world self would cross over a celestial from that space, at least not this soon.

"I don't even remember killing him in that space, but I was fighting just anything I could see at the time, and in that space, we could only see outlines, not the real figure of the enemies."

"This guy must have never thought he would meet me. He might think I'm here to get revenge to kill them all in real life or something, and they will have to reincarnate?"

"I will not kill you." Quinn said confidently, walking closer to the other.

"Is if you can meet my conditions at least. That man is never to set foot on this planet again."

Quinn pointed towards Yanny. Although Quinn personally had no troubles with him, based on the fight, he knew that was the one that Princess Wince was having trouble with.

"I assume you caused all this mess because it has something to do with your condition. Well, I wish for you to work it out with the new leader. The Princess over here."

Quinn raised his hand toward her.

For some reason, Wince found it quite embarrassing as all eyes were on her, and hearing Quinn say these words, the crowd behind started to cheer.

"Yes, bring back the old Royal family!"

"I can't believe we let that Yanny do as he wished in the first place."

"Look at them." Sil tooted. "All of sudden, they are brave and ready to defend her, but at least it looks like the Princess is happy"

Sil finally could get rid of part of his guilt with this. Although there was one thing that he still wanted and was unwilling to give up, and that was the Trident. It had become his favourite weapon.

He needed to think of some way to convince the Princess to give it back.

"Yes, I can do all those things. My condition will be fine even if I work with the Princess!" Yongu said, banging his head against the floor several times to show his sincerity.

"How could you betray me like that!" Yanni panicked, "I did everything you said. After I've served you for so long, you just toss me aside and..." Yongu had stood up and given a back fist to Yanny. It sent him flying through the city, bypassing every building and eventually, he fell into the deep sea.

"He is still alive, but if he carries on, he will definitely not bring you any trouble. Forgive him. He is one of my dedicated followers of mine." Yongu explained.

It seemed things were going well, but all of the requests Quinn had made so far were for the others and not for him, now came the moment of truth, and he was hoping for a useful answer.

"Finally, as long as you keep these promises, I will not kill you in any way or form, and in fact, I will help you when need be, but I wish for you to return me and my friend to the Earth." Quinn requested.

So far, they have had no such luck. Athos had disagreed because it would mean going against the other celestials, but how would they know where he was at that time unless they were checking every star they could find.,

At the same time, Quinn was gambling. ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

In front of him was a Celestial who feared him more than the others.

"I... I... I... I agree to the deal. I will return both you and your friend to Earth."
