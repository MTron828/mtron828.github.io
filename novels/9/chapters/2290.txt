From far away behind the tower, the Original leaders were continuing to keep up with what was going on. They were unable to keep their eyes off the fight, only missing things occasionally as they hid behind the tower when a wave or pulse of energy came out toward them.

They were witnessing the transformation take place, the lighting up of the special armour, and the changes in Ray's appearance. This led to all of the leaders turning to Edvard, taking a long look at him.

Since he was the previous owner of the armour he would have to have an answer for this. HIs mouth was left a bit open as he saw the same thing as everyone else though.

"I know you guys are looking at me, waiting for a type of answer, but I don't think you're going to believe what I'm about to say." Edvard said, and took a gulp soon after. "It appears that all along, for the duration of this fight, Ray hasn't been using the power of the armour at all.

"He has simply just been wearing it, and it wasn't until now, that he has activated the power of the armour."

The mistake had been made due to the energy that was coming off from Ray during the fight. Edvard having used the armour in the past knew what the energy felt like and he could feel the same energy resonating off of Ray.

The thing was, the armour was originally a part of Ray's body in the first place, which was why they had the same energy, and now it was being used.

"How could he be so confident to even do such a thing?" Bianca said. "He's been fighting with a handicap this whole time, is this just a game to him?"

If Quinn was easily able to overpower Ray, then this holding back would have been a bad move. These two were fighting at such a level, that one could finish the fight in one move, and then the other would have no chance to bring out their full power.

Quinn had been fighting with his full power from the get go, he was just utilising all his different skills of the armour, shadow, and blood to try find the best way to combat Ray, who seemed to be dealing with everything using just his strength and now he was even stronger.R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on nùíê/v/ùíÜ/l(b)iùíè(.)cùíêm

Using the power of the armour, a surge of power rushed out from him. It was a ripple that went out through the entire land. It didn't look to disrupt or destroy anything but just passed through everything as far as the eye could see.

There was a resonating sound like a silent roar of the dragon in the wind when the pulsing energy passed and while it was passing through the land, it had managed to pass through two people in particular who had been knocked back far from their original position.

Their bodies lay there on the floor, face down, and slowly the two of them started to get up, as they had feeling in their bodies again.

"Peter are you okay?" Chris asked, standing on his two feet first. Peter was still struggling to get up, the tingling sensation was felt through his body.

"That damned vampire demon, I'll kill‚Ä¶ kill." Peter was stumbling at the last word, and looked at the two in the distance.

"I don't think that's something we should get involved in, not unless we want to die." Chirs commented, somewhat surprised that they weren't dead right now.

The transformation of Ray had finished, but his armour was still glowing brightly. He no longer looked the same as before, his eyes were narrower, his facial structure changed, and his hair was now red on top of his head.

He still had scales on his body, spikes on his back and a set of wings, but they no longer looked like that of a Dalki. If one was to guess, he now looked more like a humanoid dragon hybrid.

'The energy, internally, I can feel that it has increased for him.' Quinn thought. 'And the energy, it's spilling out of him as well.'

It was hard to see with the naked eye, but all around Ray now there were parts of his energy, his aura. It was dark yellow and small in size, but the reason why Quinn was able to see it so clearly was due to this energy completely getting rid of his shadow mist.

Any part of the shadow that was inside him, would have completely disappeared now, and any part of the shadow that was around him, would no longer get near him, or touch him.

'The shadow‚Ä¶ will it even work now, will the blood shadow even work on him now, or will that just disappear as it touches the armour?' Quinn thought.

He wanted to know the answer, he wanted to try it out, but doing so would be a big risk, getting that close to Ray. For now, Quinn had stopped his soul weapon.

The shadow mist that was spread out thin in the area completely disappeared. There was no point using it anymore if there was no effect, there would be better ways to utilise his shadow.

Then, Quinn once again went with the same tactic. His clones all spread out into different directions and started to throw out blood swipes. Shadow portals were being opened everywhere allowing for all the strikes to hit Ray.

As the strikes got closer to Ray though, the power was so overwhelming from him and his armour, that the blood swipes would begin to disappear. The shadow around it had completely disappeared and finally only a regular blood strike had hit Ray's armour doing next to nothing.

Ray bent his knees slightly, his wings were brought in closer to give him a more aerodynamic form, and he looked carefully and locked eyes on one of the Quinn's.

"Locked on!"

The ground beneath Ray's feet exploded and a fist was right next to one of the Quinn's, it went right through one of the Quinn's head exploding it into a cloud of smoke. It wasn't just one puff of smoke though.

Ray went from one, right on to the next Quinn, and crashed his whole body through theirs, creating another cloud of smoke.

'He's gotten faster‚Ä¶ a lot faster and although I don't know about his strength yet, I'm sure he's gotten a lot stronger as well, but I don't want to find out.'

It was beginning to look like Quinn had no choice, he couldn't think, he couldn't act, as Ray destroyed clone after clone until there were no more.

After defeating the last clone, Ray flapped his wings hovering in the air, and turned to Quinn.

"What are the chances that the real one is the last one?" Ray smiled. "You have done well, and your powers are strong, its just a shame that you went up against me. I always would think of ways to combat the shadow, if it ever came back again.

"I might be the only person in the universe that can completely get rid of your shadow in a way like this. For putting up a good fight, I will end you properly."

Ray lifted one hand into the air. From the tip of his fingers, the strong dark orange aura started to gather like flames around his gauntlet hand. He then pointed it towards Quinn, bending it back.

The dark orange aura continued to gather around the gauntlet hand, to the point where the hand could no longer be seen and another image was forming. Of all things, it was forming the image of a sword.

"The Dragon sword fist. It might be over kill, but that is how much I respect you."

Ray burst through the air, just like he had done with all the other clones. Quinn didn't even want to test if his armour would be able to withstand the attack, even if it could, he feared he would still die anyway, so there was only one thing left to do.

[Shadow space.]

Panic started to set in Quinn, because the skill Shadow space wasn't working.
