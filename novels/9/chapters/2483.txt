Chapter 2484 Immortui Vs Sil

Using his fast travel technique, with his red energy surrounding him, Immortui was able to move from area to area pretty fast. He needed to focus for a few moments to speed up as well as search for those with little energy in their body, but when he found them, he crashed on those planets and always saw the same person in front of him.

"I see," Immortui said, as he lifted his hand and activated his colourless power, which touched the Sil clone, causing their body to disappear after a few moments. "This person is able to make copies of themselves and is distracting me, buying time, but I will soon find the real one, and there is a chance that I will find the real one."

Immortui went from one planet to the next, and eventually crashed on a planet that looked to be made entirely of ice. However, it wasn't ice; the material was far harder, more like diamonds.

Most of the surface was relatively flat, with platforms here and there. There weren't giant caverns or giant ice shards sticking out from the ground, just different levels of areas here and there.

Standing on the ground looking up at Immortui, the clone did nothing, as if it was there just to accept its fate, unlike the last few he had met, who had attempted to teleport or run away.

However, Immortui, before reaching the planet, would have already activated part of his colourless power, stopping that from happening the moment he appeared. This clone, as its body was disappearing, looked Immortui straight in the eye.

"Are you no longer worried by your deaths? We will see how you feel when I meet the real one of you," Immortui said.

The body completely disappeared, and the colourless power was retracted back into Immortui. His colourless power also affected the red energy in the air, so he was unable to use one power while using the other.

Finishing his retraction, he was getting ready to move to the next area. He was trying to sense where the others were, but he soon opened his eyes.

'Wait a moment, why are so many of them suddenly close?'

Right in front of him, after finishing that thought, around ninety different Sils had teleported right in front of him. Immediately, all of them gathered lightning and fire in their hands and fired it right at Immortui.

Meanwhile, the real Sil had arrived as well, staying a little further back than the rest. Condensed lightning bolt was being held in his hands, while the rest of his arm was completely blue.

'With how quickly the Sils were getting destroyed, I knew you must have had some way to travel fast between them all and a way to locate them. Because of that, it was too dangerous to leave you be, in case you find the others.'

Swinging with his arm, Sil hurled the lightning bolt, which made a thunderous noise as it left his hands and smashed right toward the centre where Immortui was. It was a strong, successful hit, and along with all of the other clones, there weren't going to be many that could withstand this. But if this was enough to defeat Immortui, then he wouldn't have been considered a grand threat.

'I have the foresight ability. I can see it. If I just let all the clones continue on like this, then all of them are going to be killed.'

The moment the attacks had started to surround all of his body, the strange clothing he wore that appeared to grow out of his skin and had a pair of eyes around his waist crawled up nearly the entirety of his body, covering him from head to toe. The eyes around his waist then looked to be glowing red around his chest instead.

The fire and lightning all looked to be just bouncing off him. Throwing out his hand, the snake-like dragon had wrapped around it, and the explosive red power attack was launched. It had ignited nearly the entire space where the fist had been thrown, too fast for the Sils to avoid, killing ten percent of them. In its place, there was a large imprint on the planet's flowing surface covered in scales, and around 10 percent of the clones had been defeated.

'None of the clones currently have the foresight ability. I gave them teleportation, two elemental abilities, telepathy, and hardening so they could survive a little longer, but the hardening was unable to do anything with that attack.'

"But I can still change my own powers!" Sil grabbed the book; it glowed for a few moments and he pulled out a golden sword. When he landed on the floor, the rest of the Sils teleported to the side, still with their abilities in their hand. Next, he activated his super speed ability and swung the sword, hitting Immortui right across his chest. The armour seemed to split off from where the cut was made and swirled about in the air slightly. Seeing what Immortui was going to do next, Sil quickly moved out of the way.

A large red portal was created from above where they were, and when Immortui punched down, a large fist came pounding from the top but hit the planet's floor, crushing it to pieces.

'Things are going well so far. It's a good thing the champions told me about Immortui's many powers,' Sil thought, recalling the conversations he had with them.

The strange substance that looked like armour on his legs could extend out to his whole body. This armour seemed able to block out energy-type attacks, including things like lightning, but if they were hit physically, attacks would get through. On top of that, Immortui had the red mist power that he could control. In a lot of ways, this worked like blood aura, which meant this power was the most versatile in the way it could be used. The way Immortui liked to use the power, though, was forming large portals, and when he struck, in the same place the portal opened, a giant fist of power would strike as well. One of his most powerful forms of attack, though, was the two dragons that hovered above his shoulders. They could sometimes act on their own if one got too close to Immortui, but if combined with his fists, they would be able to deliver an earth-shattering blow. Finally, there was the colourless power.

At that moment, Immortui raised his hand, but when he did, all of the clone Sils by the side started to fire away their powers, hitting Immortui. His hand had lowered, and the armour started to raise on his body again. The colourless ability, if he was hit, he was unable to activate it. With all of these powers, Immortui had the strength to beat nearly anyone in a fight, but he had never gone against someone like Sil before.

Sil could very well be Immortui's natural enemy with all of his powers.
