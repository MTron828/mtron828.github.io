Chapter 1268 - I'm Evil

Thinking about what he was about to do next, Peter had a grin on his face that went from ear to ear. He was so pleased, but for those that did manage to catch the look on his face, it looked like a creepy smile rather than a pleasant one.

His deep dark black eye sockets and pale skin didn’t help for that matter. Peter ran through the Shelter with the legs and tail following behind him, causing quite the scene. The problem was, there really was no one who could do anything about it since they were moving so fast.

The teleporter that Peter had come through could be seen ahead left on, and jumping through, he was back on the Cursed ship and soon to follow after him where the pair of legs.

"What the hell is that!" The guard shouted.

"Those scales, and that tail, it’s a Dalki body, I’m sure of it! Attack, attack!"

"Don’t attack!" Peter shouted right after. "Am I going to have to explain these legs everywhere I go? I mean, we have vampires and all sorts of things in the Cursed faction. Heck, Logan has a Dalki arm.. I thought this wouldn’t be too strange."

Looking at them again though, even Peter had to admit it did look a little out of place. A Dalki was relatively large compared to a human, so even though it was just Slicer’s legs, it nearly was as tall as a human itself, and a lot of the Cursed faction looked scared looking at the tail.

"Legs there is with me." Peter calmly said before everyone came raiding the room any second now to take on the Dalki. He could just imagine even Bonny and Void appearing out of nowhere. They always seemed to be around when the most interesting things were happening. A slight smirk appeared on his face as Peter imagined the news reports.

"Actually, do you mind doing me a favour? Report to Sam to come meet me, and then this way he can inform everyone to not be alarmed. Otherwise, all my hard work might be for nothing if everyone started to suddenly attack it."

The guards looked at each other, thinking that Peter must have had a screw loose or something. The reason being, although they knew that Peter was most likely a V, they had no idea of his powers, and this was something that they didn’t know they could do. Due to them not knowing about the subclasses within the vampire race.

In the end, they decided to call Sam to the teleporter station immediately. They listened to Peter just because it looked like the Leg’s and tail weren’t attacking them or anything in the room.

——

A little while later, Sam was seen appearing in the room, with Linda by his side. The only reason why he had brought her was because the men on the other end sounded a bit afraid and had told him to bring some back up with him.

"Come on, what could have Peter brought with him that would be just so-"

He couldn’t even finish his sentence, as his eyes were set on the pair of legs in the room, which at this moment was sitting down, but the large tail could be seen swinging up at a height taller than a human.

"It’s cool, right. I spoke to Logan, and he made me rack my brain a little, so I came up with this." Peter explained.

For Sam, going through all the possibilities in his head, he had figured it out. It was clear that this was the bottom half of Slicer’s Body. The fact that it wasn’t attacking anyone and Peter was the one who had brought it, the most likely reason was it had something to do with his Wight abilities.

"This is good news," Sam said, carefully shuffling towards it, and stopped the second he had got within the range of the tail. When he saw Peter showing it was fine to get close, Sam moved forward, and Linda did the same.

"Her tail was the greatest strength of the Dalki. It was even able to cut through Hilston’s Demon tier armour. This has to be a gold mine. We don’t know if its strength is the same or its sharpness, but I would guess it has to be at a similar level."

Hearing this, Peter had one more surprise for Sam and started to whisper in his ears. After listening to what Peter had to say, his eyes lit up even wider than before.

"1A, is the number," Sam said, and straight away, Peter was running off again. "Legs follow and listen to Sam!" Peter ordered.

Using its tail, it gave off a salute by its waist since it had no head.

’I guess I’m going to have to prepare an announcement.’ Sam thought, looking at the thing.

——

After getting the okay from Sam, Peter found himself in the ship’s morgue. A very cold room, but for Peter, he felt no difference. There were several what looked like file cabinets with numbers in the corner of each of them.

In the very corner of the room, Peter could see the number 1A. Unlike before, without hesitation, Peter was able to pull on the handle, and a body in a glass tube-like container was seen coming out. This was Peter’s next turning target.

The only thing was that it had no head, and the reason for that was Sil stepping on it, eradicating it.

’I can only create two lesser Wights at a time, so why not have the two strongest we have ever seen before.’ Peter thought.

For the next person, he was ready to turn, was Hilston. No one, not even Sil would care what would happen to his body. In fact, the reason why it was in the morgue in the first place was so Peter could feast on it.

’I’m going to have to explain to those guys when they come back, although, without your head, I’m not sure they will recognise you.’ Peter thought, placing his hand on a healthy part of his chest after the glass container covering the body went away.

He knew turning Hilston, he wouldn’t be able to use his abilities like the others he had turned before, but Hilston was supernatural. Even without his beast gear, he had the speed and strength to match a low-level vampire lord. It was an amazing feat, something that seemed impossible.

At the same time, if Hilston turned out to be somewhat weaker, then he imagined it was no loss on their part. Peter would take pleasure in using his body as a human meat shield.

A few seconds later, after repeating the process, the body rose from the table it laid on.

"Haha." Peter chuckled. "Oh, how I would love to punch you right now for that slap, you gave me, but there’s no point. I know it’s better to use you."

With both pieces he needed, Peter was ready to put them into action, just like Quinn. Peter needed to figure out the best way to utilise his two lesser Wights in the middle of a fight while also using his powers. Still, for sure, Peter had now become a formidable foe that nobody would want to face.

This was exactly what Sam was thinking as he was looking at Slicer at the moment.

’Quinn, Leo, Erin, Layla, Sil and now Peter as well. These will be the key members of the Cursed faction in the future. Perhaps if Vorden and Raten evolve into Demon tier beasts as well. We might have a chance at winning this war after all.’

——

On Blade island, currently, Vorden and Raten were trying to do just that. They were going around hunting for strong beasts, improving their skills, and gathering their crystals. There were also the beasts that had been captured that were at the legendary level underneath.

Borden, and Sil were helping as well, but Sil not too much since the others didn’t want him to help. As for Vicky, Pai and their mother and father. The four of them had decided to leave the island and do as they had said they would.

To hunt down those Chained that had strong abilities and a chance in the future to disrupt and ruin the flow of everything. After all, without Turedream present, these were the type of ability users who had chucked the world into chaos before.

For Eno, he was in his favourite spot, looking out from the castle at the whole island staring into space. All the preparation he wanted to do and needed to do was done. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"Sometimes I think of the past," Eno said. "You know, I thought after all these years that I would learn to forget about the past, yet here I am. Brock, Do you think I’m evil?" Eno asked.

"Evil sir is subjective," Brock answered. "You should know that much by now, sir. We have both seen how history books from the humans and the vampires have been written. Sometimes people often put things in categories of good or bad, black and white. While others will say that there is a grey area. For me, I believe that there is just one colour. There is no right and wrong, there is just what people want to do, and you have always just followed what you wanted to do."

After Brock’s answer, there was silence from Eno until he finally spoke.

"It looks like he is finally making his move. We should prepare to call the others back."
