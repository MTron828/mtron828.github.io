Chapter 411 Kill the black Rabbi

As soon as the strange water creature was killed, at first Quinn thought it was for something as simple as petty revenge. But watching it for a little while longer he thought that maybe there was more to it than that.

Now that he had received his new quest, he knew he was going to kill the rabbit, even though it had done nothing to him. Usually, he wouldn‚Äôt do this type of thing, even to beasts. Nearly ninety-nine percent of beasts were hostile towards humans for some reason but there were a few expectations. But this was a desperate time and desperate times needed desperate measures.

He would kill a 1000 black rabbits without a second thought, if it was for the sake of him getting stronger so he could save his comrades. Still, it looked as if the Black rabbit was continuing to do strange actions. It started to head downstream and followed the river along, and the army of rabbits followed behind it as well.

Every so often it would stop, and it looked as if the rabbits that were following it along were starting to slow down and go off doing their own things.

Whenever this was to happen, the black rabbit would start squealing again, making high pitched noises and the white rabbits would get back in line and continue to follow the black leader. it was hard to tell if it was an ability or if they were just listening to the leader.

The most strange thing about these creatures though, was that Quinn couldn‚Äôt tell if they were beasts or not. When using his inspect skill, there was no such beast ranking. This was the same for the wendigo type creatures.

"It‚Äôs because they are familiers and not beasts." The System replied. "The vampire world is deeply connected with the familiar‚Äôs world and often opens up rifts sending them into ours. Just as not all vampires are able to have familiars not all familiars can form contracts either. As you can see, that black rabbit is a little special. We still do not yet know what allows them to evolve."

Although it was interesting learning about this stuff, Quinn didn‚Äôt really care about it. The only reason he was being cautious was because he couldn‚Äôt tell how strong the white rabbits and the black rabbits were. After continuing to follow them for a while, he saw that they had eventually reached the creature that had been defeated.

It was being blocked by a strange-looking dam made out of trees. Although the water could continually flow, the strange tree made dam was able to catch other things.

The rabbits then hopped along with the trees and the black rabbit reached the creature starting to do something, but Quinn couldn‚Äôt quite see as it wasn‚Äôt that clear. After a few moments, inside the black rabbit‚Äôs mouth, there was a beast crystal, and a clear one at that which made Quinn guess that the beast they had defeated was at the intermediate level.

If he was to take a guess, having the power to control the other rabbits, on top of using his strange lighting horn, would put the rabbit at around the advanced level.

Not a hundred percent sure, but now knowing this new information, he certainly felt a lot more confident about facing the thing. However, he continued to follow the rabbit, wondering just what it would do with the crystal. They crossed the dam and staying a good distance away, Quinn then crossed it himself later.

Following them through the forest, it appeared they had finally left the forest area and entered a new area. Still, he made sure to be aware of where he was and where the city was. This area was covered in strange stones, the flooring had changed to a pebble like feeling and there were also many large rocks. Finally reaching what looked like a fairly large cliff wall, the bunnies had entered a cave.

"Perfect!" Quinn thought. Not only would he find out why and where they had taken the beast crystal, but also quite possibly this was their home base.

As Quinn took a peek inside the cave from the side, he could see that the cave didn‚Äôt go too deep in and there didn‚Äôt look to be any paths. But what did surprise him was the number of glowing crystals he could see. There was a pile of beast crystals lumped in the back, and the black rabbit had dropped the current crystal in his mouth on top of the mound.

"There must be about a hundred and fifty crystals in there." Most of them looked to be at the intermediate level, but it was hard to tell if there was anything higher due to them all being piled on top of each other.

With only one entrance in and out, the bunnies were trapped and quite possibly this gold mine was all his. Entering the cave and seeing all the bunnies, Quinn was ready. Not wanting to give them a chance, he opened up his palm.

[Blood spray]

His hand slightly flung backwards and a shotgun like spray of Blood had hit most of the white rabbits, while the black rabbit hopped over behind the pile of crystals. Some of the crystals went flying, hitting the back of the cave wall, but beast crystals were as strong as diamond and hard to break. They often could only be melted at extremely high temperatures.

[First White horned rabbit killed. 200 exp Gained]

[White horned rabbit killed 100 exp gained]

The messages had appeared at least twenty times, giving him a good chunk of exp.

[35090/51200 experience points]

Still, it wasn‚Äôt enough and if he wanted to do anything, he would need to kill the black rabbit. Suddenly though, as Quinn went to move forward, a blue stream of lightning had come out and at the last second, he managed to move his head, allowing the attack to singe off a small part of his hair.

The attack was incredibly fast, and it seemed like even if he was to use his shadow as a type of defense, then quite possibly it wouldn‚Äôt be fast enough to block the attack. N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

Not being able to see the rabbit clearly, but knowing where it was, Quinn lifted his hand, performing a Blood swipe. The attack sent out five lines of red aura. Although he couldn‚Äôt see where the rabbit was at least he would be able to lure it out or quite possibly hit it injuring it.

But then, a small little black bolt could be seen running towards him, and the next second it had already gone past him.

‚ÄôHow fast is that thing!‚Äô Quinn thought, but he knew for sure now he could kill it. It appeared to be a creature that mainly focused on speed, and the fact it was running away from him when it didn‚Äôt run away from the other beasts, could quite possibly mean it knew it wasn‚Äôt strong enough to go against Quinn.

Giving chase, he decided he would leave the crystals behind, levelling up was more important than a bunch of crystals and he quickly went to chase after the black rabbit.

[Wind walk] Using his boots skill, as long as he wasn‚Äôt hit during the active skill, he would be able to run around ten percent faster. Now that his speed was far greater than before, the effects of the boots were too. With this he was able to keep up with the black bunny.

Now getting a closer look, he could see the sparks of electricity, coming off its paws as they hit the ground. Quite possibly the energy it had used for an attack was now being used to power its legs. He continued the chase until they had entered the part of the forest they were in once before, but he knew it was pointless. Their speeds right now were the same, so their distance would stay the same as well.

[Crescent kick] Quinn activated as he lifted his legs, sending out an attack far ahead. Performing the attack slowed him down slightly, but he was hoping it would affect the rabbit far more worse. The crescent kick was performed at a slight diagonal angle, hitting one of the large trees in front of both him and the rabbit. When it did so, the tree started to slide down and now stood in the rabbit‚Äôs path.

The rabbit knew it could try to go around, but its trunk was far too thick for it to hop over it, and Quinn was now upon it.

[Blood swipe] Quinn performed it two times, completely surrounding it, and he was ready for his level up that was in site.

The Rabbit had accepted its fate and squinted its eyes, but then from behind the tree, a figure appeared in front of the rabbit.

"Blood wall." A thick red wall of aura had come up, and as Quinn‚Äôs attack had hit, he had expected them to smash. Instead, though, it looked as if the blood wipe was pushing back the blood wall.

Unsure of what was going to happen, the person quickly picked up the black rabbit and jumped off to the side just in time. As the blood wall had been broken by the blood swipes and continued forward into the back of the tree.

"What the hell are you doing, attacking my familiar?" The person shouted.
