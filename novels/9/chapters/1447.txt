Chapter 1448 - A Worse Threat (Part 2)

"That idiot!" A voice was heard. Due to the certain individual who had spoken a lot before, the others were able to recognise the voice. It was coming from Abdul, the Unranked who stood next to Sera's side most of the time. "You didn't even bother covering your mouth! Did you think this thing wouldn't affect you or something?" UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Abdul, complained while having created a makeshift mask from ripping a piece from his shirt. The two were towards the back of the room, more so than the others, which was why the gas had taken longer to affect them compared to everyone else.

'I guess even if they have that immense power, there are some things that even affect them.' Leo concluded.

Just because Sera had the power of a God residing in him, didn't mean his body wasn't that of a human's. Perhaps an enhanced human, but a human nonetheless, which meant that even he suffered the smoke's effect. Alas, this God of War had been too stubborn to believe that he would fall to such a thing.

"It looks like our strongest are falling in the room one by one, and we're too egoistic to have to deal with this mess." Sach pointed out, as he got into a fighting stance, standing by Leo's side. He looked at Mona, Sil, and now Sera who had all collapsed.

The problem was, it wasn't exactly like the vampires were unaffected by the smoke, they just had more resistance to it. The sound of Agent 3 could be heard moving, and Sach decided to meet him head-on.

"Let me take care of this!" Sach shouted, going in front of the Vampire Knight.

'If I take the first blow, then it will give the chance for Leo to strike!' Was the thought running through the Supreme Commander's head, and it seemed like Leo was following along with the plan, following a short distance behind him.

However, a large fist of what looked to be raw muscle with no skin came out and hit Sach. He was able to lift his knee to protect himself. With his ability and new vampire body, he should have been able to withstand any blow, and this fact was proven in the came. The strike that hit him though wasn't just powerful, it had the power of Qi behind it.

Sach could feel his cells reacting strangely as an explosive power hit him, sending him flying back and hitting against the wall. Once again, the bones in his knees, he could feel they had slightly fractured but worst of all, it didn't seem to be healing like it usually would have.

'I can still use my leg. Guess I'm lucky it's not broken, but if anyone else gets hit by him it won't end well for us.'

Leo, noticed the other hand come towards him, and activated his soul weapon. Using it, he was able to redirect the punch over to the side. He didn't use too much of his power, afraid that it would drain him quickly.

Since his last fights he knew now that when he was facing stronger opponents, it was best if he naturally deflected the attack while only using part of his soul weapon's ability to redirect the aura. There was no way for him to increase the amount of MC cells in his body so instead he needed to put each one to better use.

Using his skill, the hand missed and went past him, and now Leo had an arm that was prime for chopping off.

With his blade he struck down, making sure to coat it in Qi, and he could see it quickly cutting through the muscular red flesh. His second stage Qi made it as sharp as ever. However, as it reached halfway something strange happened. It looked as if the muscles on the arm were alive, as they were cut and detached from the hand, they started to wrap around the sword, almost holding it in place. Each strand moving individually holding onto it tight.

The sword also looked to be doing nothing, as the muscles themselves were now coated in Qi as well.

'I can feel the strong Qi through this beast's body! How can a beast use Qi?' Leo wondered.

'Do you need my help?'

'Not yet‚Ä¶if it comes to it, I'll gladly fight this thing together, though.' Leo replied to his familiar.

Right now he had to figure out the problem in front of him, for even with his second stage of Qi it seemed that he was struggling to pull out his blade. Grim and Owen had been busy with Logan trying to find a way to get rid of the smoke, or break out of the room.

Unfortunately, they haven't quite figured out a way just yet. In the first place, Grim and Owen's strength were in their abilities, yet it seemed to have no effect on the glass. Seeing that Leo and Sach might be in trouble, they could see the creature now fully as it walked up to Leo. On its back, it had what looked like countless bones sticking out from it. They were in no shape or form, but just looked like multiple hands dangling from its back.

Agent 3, was roughly the same size as a Dalki, but its body was something else. Completely covered in flesh, with the same markings of white in certain places. It didn't look like a beast, but something that came from the world of the undead itself.

'We have to try and get out of this place!' Logan concluded since his spiders were taking too long. Instead he took off the casing from his arm, which revealed his Dalki self underneath. The Graylash family were too focused to be in shock, as Logan pulled back and threw a punch towards the glass as hard as he could.

When it hit though it did little to nothing.

'Damn it, my strength is not enough!'

"Hut me, cut my arm!" Logan demanded from the two.

Owen was a bit hesitant, but Grim had caught on to what the boy was trying to do. A single finger was coating in lighting, as Grim went to cut Logan's Dalki arm as much as possible. Now, Logan could feel the Dalki strength rising in him.

He punched the wall again, and this time there had been a slight crack in it.

"More!" Logan shouted, but his arm was already bleeding heavily and blood was dripping on the floor.

"The boy could die." Owen said concerned.

Seeing this, the two thought of another solution and could see that the beast was getting ready to attack Leo again. Trying to stop his advance, the two were getting ready to attack the beast when a large figure handed them something. They were surprised that it was two women, Samantha and Mona. He shoved them forward quickly, trying to empathise with something.

"I think he wants us to look after them." Grim figured out.

'Isn't this the beast that Mona was controlling? Is it acting on its own? I thought in situations like this, the tamed beast is meant to do whatever it can to protect its owner‚Ä¶so what is this?' Owen wondered while holding onto Mona.

The next second, the large figure started to charge straight towards Agent 3 with no fear at all. It wasn't affected by any of the gas in the slightest, and continued to run forward until it tackled the Pure agent. It also grabbed onto both of its arms and gripped it with as much strength as possible, causing it to finally let go of Leo's sword.

Before any of them could react, it had crashed through the back of the glass container, shattering it, and the two were falling onto the arena stage. The two looked to be struggling mid flight, but the large figure was still holding onto the box. Until, he eventually dropped the box, and it fell to the ground. The impact had caused the latch to open, and a round object could be seen rolling out.
