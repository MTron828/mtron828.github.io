The team that had entered in search of supporting Quinn, had split up into two groups, one of them being led by Hikel, along with his allies Russ and Chris. Although led was a loosely used term in this situation since they were all strong individuals.

They had decided to stay in the place where they had arrived, in search of information from the one who was named Demon King by the locals, and it was how they had ended up in their current situation.

The Chronos, the inhabitants of the area they were in, stated that when the sun fell, that was when hell would start. They weren't quite sure what was meant by this until now.

Stuck in a large hole with weapons close to the demon tier level in terms of power, they were all waiting to see what was going to happen, and that's when they saw it. Crawling down from the sides, from the very top of the hole, were Werewolves.

Chris was able to smell their familiarity, and it was causing an instinct in him to react. His teeth were already partly transforming, and he had to hold himself back from changing.

'Why is my body acting this way from seeing them...and why are they in a place like this?' Chris thought.

He himself, although being a Werewolf, didn't know much about them. The reason why he was the way he was, was mostly due to Agent 4 running experiments on the members of Pure, including him.

However, there was one more that recognized the creatures, and that was Hikel. Being an Original, he was there through the years when the vampires and Werewolves were at each other's necks, and he knew full well how frightening these creatures could be.

'Why, in another world altogether, are there Werewolves here...and the number of them,' Hikel thought.

So far, he could see about thirty or so crawling towards them. Of course, Werewolves, just like vampires, varied in strength, but looking at these Werewolves, they didn't look weak at all.

On closer inspection, they actually looked slightly different from the Werewolves he had seen. Werewolves tended to have different colored fur, and different traits; there were different types of Werewolves, and Hikel would have said he had encountered all of the types there were, yet he had never seen these before.

The color of their fur was tinted red. It was mainly black, but with the light shining on one of the moons in the background, one could see the fur was actually a very dark red.

On top of that, the shape of the Werewolves was different as well. The upper half of their body was larger than a Werewolf would surely be. All of these werewolves were fully transformed, but still, their upper half with their arms and back was incredibly large, and this was also true for their eyes.

They covered a lot of the area on their face, making them look almost as if they were bulging out. With these differences, Hikel might have even thought that they might not even be Werewolves, but due to the smell, he was certain these were Werewolves.

'It must be because of this world they're slightly different; they have evolved over time. Maybe even if the Werewolves were still alive in our world, they would have evolved to this state, but this is very dangerous, these Werewolves might even be stronger than the ones that I know.'

The Werewolves had descended at an incredibly fast speed, and when they were close to the bottom, some of them had leapt off going towards the nearest living being.

They had bared their large cloak-like hands and had their mouths wide open. One of the Chronos was holding onto a large double-handed axe. He lifted it in the air, and the edge started to light up.

Swinging it down towards the Werewolf, a large line of energy was released, cutting the ground and headed straight for the Werewolf. Now the others were able to see what they meant when Chris was talking about the weapons being strong.I think you should take a look at

When the attack reached the Werewolf, it swung one of its arms, and ripped right through the attack. It landed on the ground and then pounced from its position, immediately coming directly in front of the Chrono.

'There, really fast,' Russ thought. His legs had already transformed to a fast vampire that the others had the image of in their heads. It felt like if he was to let his guard down in the middle of all of this, he would be taken out.

The Chrono swung the axe down again, but before it could reach the Werewolf, they had grabbed the weapon and yanked it out of the Chrono's hand. Then with its other hand, it swiped a claw ring right through the Chrono's face as if it was made of butter, killing it on the spot.

Seeing this, everyone was starting to sweat a little. The Chrono weren't weak, the weapons they were using weren't weak; it was just that the Werewolves were incredibly strong.

Now, nearly all of the Werewolves had reached the bottom floor, and chaos had started in the giant hole. The Werewolves were moving in really fast; the sound of weapons clashing and being used was constantly heard throughout, as well as screams of pain as they were hit.

Then, out from the right, a Werewolf's claw swung directly to hit the arm of Hikel. He managed to gather his aura out from the strange markings that were on his arm and wrap it around his forearm, blocking the attack.

The Werewolves were physically stronger than the vampires in nearly every way. Their attacks were deadly to them, and even their healing in most cases was better than them.

The vampires' only advantage was the blood aura and the abilities they could use.

"I never thought I would have to go against you guys again!" Hikel shouted as the aura exploded out with force, pushing the Werewolf away. It slid across the ground, with a few burn marks on its skin, but they were healing on the spot at an incredibly fast rate.

'I can't let these Werewolves directly hurt me. Otherwise, my body is going to have a hard time healing. If I use my power fully here as well, there is a good chance it's going to cause a big problem as well,' Hikel thought.R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at n√¥(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In the end, though, what choice did they have? Because if they didn't act, all of the Chronos would be dead, and then the only ones left as the Werewolves' target would be them.

From the small scuffle, they might have been stronger than the Werewolves on an individual basis, but if they were to go up against thirty all at once at this strength, Hikel felt like it wasn't a fight they could win.
