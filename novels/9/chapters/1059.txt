Chapter 1060 - Give us the boy

The faction hall had turned into a complete mess in mere seconds. When the Marked came rushing out of the room, some expected only a few to have gone mad. After all, they were really being checked on, and they even had a list of which markings had developed more.

Now they realised that the whole thing was useless. Every single person they had captured looked like they had already been taken over by whatever the marking was. What was worse, is how the faction members needed to deal with them.

They were unable to kill them, and at the same time, they were being cautious about getting bitten or hit, as they knew the infection would spread to them as well.

"We need to get out of here!" Layla said.

"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an option," Fex replied. "Looking at how many Graylash members are in on this, I‚Äôm afraid it might be the whole lot of them. Do you remember what they were doing outside?"

The Graylash faction was in charge of defending the newly built shelter walls. They had just reinforced it by surrounding themselves with five layers. Most likely, they were trapped and had already dealt with everyone outside.

Fex was shooting out strings using all of his fingertips, trying to tie up as many of the Marked as possible. At one point, one of the Marked had come close to a faction member, but their body was pulled back just at the right moment.

Layla saw how hard Fex was trying and wouldn‚Äôt just stand there either. The Marked seemed to be unintelligent and uncaring about everything. So she would fire off her arrows, hitting them in the legs with ease. Geett the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Looking at the situation, Eno could see that the Graylash members were attacking the faction members with their lightning strikes but weren‚Äôt aiming to kill them like they did with the guards. Instead, it looked like they were aiming for certain spots causing minor injuries or just to distract them.

It looked to be working, as one of the faction members raised a shield to block a lightning strike, but then was jumped by one of the Marked, and it bit through his shoulder guard.

"Are they trying to increase their numbers?" Eno thought. "And it looks like the Marked aren‚Äôt going after those from the Graylash. Do they have something that even I don‚Äôt know about?" Eno thought.

The man who had been hit, only seconds later, his eyes started to glow, and he too had become one of the Marked as well. Unlike before, the markings were seemingly turning people mad in seconds rather than hours or days.

"I was wrong. It looks like everything I was doing was wrong. Was it tricking us?!" Hayley said, seeing the situation unfold, as slowly more and more of the Marked were being created, it would only be a matter of time before everyone became a Marked.

"This is not your fault. None of this is!" Layla shot out a black spiritual chain hitting one of the Marked and wrapping around him.

‚ÄôThis form isn‚Äôt strong enough, but luckily there is a lot of negative energy in this room. It will be useless to evolve into my third form, so my second form will be best.‚Äô Layla thought, as her body started to change.

She grew slightly taller, the horns hidden behind her hair started to come through, and the fangs on her face were becoming enlarged. She had become far more fighting than anything in the room.

In her second form, she could use the emotions around her to power her, and the more negative emotions there were, the faster and more powerful her strikes would be. The next second, Hayley saw one of the Marked get chucked across the room into the others.

Looking up, Hayley couldn‚Äôt help but stare at what was in front of her. It looked like Layla, but at the same time, it didn‚Äôt.

"Layla, what are you?" She asked.

She wasn‚Äôt the only one that decided to get into action. Peter was being himself, hitting and chucking the Marked all over the place, slamming them as they came at him. This had gotten a lot of attention from all the Marked around, and he was probably one of the only ones that didn‚Äôt have to be afraid of being bitten.

He already had received several scratches and bite marks, but they would heal up, and he wouldn‚Äôt feel any different. It was clear he was immune to it, just like he was resistant to other things as well.

This was also true for Linda, who had grown in size and had decided to grab as many of the faction members as possible and place them behind her, the number was already dwindling to the last ten, and she could see they could really do nothing.

Wevil seemed to be in his element, attacking while not getting hit. He was treating it as a game, only transforming his legs. At the same time, the Marked were still human, so he could get blood whenever he wished.

Sil, no longer had the lightning powers. It had been too long since he used them, but he still had the wood power that was made to create the Cell. He could grow wood from underneath to wrap around the Marked, but those that were faction members and wearing beast gear were able to break free from the wood. Still, Sil had plenty of MC cells to continuously wrap around their legs over and over.

Eventually, all the cursed members fought the Marked while heading towards the centre of the hall, but it seemed endless. Hitting them down, they would just get back up. Even with the leg injuries, they would walk on the broken parts as if they felt no pain.

Now in the centre of the training hall stood all the Cursed, six surviving members of the faction, and finally Hayley.

"Stop!" The Graylash member said, who spoke when they first entered. He was wearing a bright white robe as usual, and it looked as if all the Marked listened to him as they stood still.

"Look at this, isn‚Äôt all the fighting pointless? Why don‚Äôt you just give in and come over to this side? We won‚Äôt kill you, we promise." The Graylash member said.

"You‚Äôre Crazy! Why are you doing this!" Hayley shouted.

"Why, you humans were the ones that invaded this place first. Isn‚Äôt it right for me to get rid of you?" The Graylash member spoke, and soon his eyes started to glow like all the others as well. Pulling down the top of his robe, his muscles showed, but what they could see now was the marking having developed all over the person‚Äôs body.

It went up along their c.h.e.s.t, down their arms and on their back.

"They were already Marked, possibly from the beginning," Eno said. "Now it‚Äôs starting to make sense. The one talking to us is not the Graylash family, but the Demon tier beast."

"Demon tier beast, what do you mean, where is the demon tier beast? Is it here?!" Wevil was confused.

"No, the Demon tier is somewhere else, but it‚Äôs using them to fight us," Eno replied once again. "However, it looks like it doesn‚Äôt want to kill us either. Perhaps it realises that our strength is far greater than all these around us. If it was to mark us like it did the rest."

The twenty Graylash members lifted their hands up, pointing them towards the group of people. While all the Marked moved to the side, clearing a path.

"Are we just going to stand here and let them attack us?" Linda asked, ready to transform once again. Right now, it looked like the members of the Cursed faction were the only ones that could fight.

"Let me ask you?" The Graylash member said. "If I ordered all of these Marked here to jump at you at once, while we used the Graylash‚Äôs ability to attack you, do you think you would survive?

"You probably haven‚Äôt noticed since we don‚Äôt want to injure you, but the marking allows us to increase the human‚Äôs power by sharing my own with them. You still haven‚Äôt had a taste of what we can do." The Graylash member said, l.i.c.k.i.n.g his lips.

Frustrated, Fex summoned his soul weapon, the black needle and threw it into one of the Marked nearby, pulling him over to their side with his strings.

"You ain‚Äôt so special!" Fex shouted. "You‚Äôre not the only one that can control people."

The Graylash started to chuckle.

"You are certainly an amusing one. I would love to see what‚Äôs inside your brain."

While Fex was taunting the person, the others were looking for a way out of the place. They were all strong, but their main issue was they were unable to kill the people in the room. The only other option was to escape, but they were surrounded. They were also sure that the Demon tier wasn‚Äôt bluffing about the Graylash‚Äôs power.

"You look like you want to leave this place." The Graylash member said. "Why don‚Äôt we come up with a deal? Give us the boy, and we‚Äôll let you go."

The Graylash member was pointing towards Sil.

‚ÄôSil, why would they want Sil?‚Äô Layla thought, but it hit her. If the Demon tier was able to control Sil. The strongest ability user there was. With the extra power it could give him, it would make the Demon tier beast unstoppable.

"You have been holding back while using your powers, haven‚Äôt you?" Eno said, looking at Sil. "Why don‚Äôt you get rid of them?"

"Because, if I was to use my powers, they might die by accident, and Quinn wouldn‚Äôt want me to kill them," Sil answered.

The Graylash member, seeing that Sil and Eno looked unfrightened, was getting frustrated. Of course, even if they gave the boy, they were never going to let them go. It wanted to watch the humans as they had hope and then take it away from them, but the hope had never left any of their eyes.

Still, at least it was enjoying the despair the people felt, but why? Why did the blonde-haired boy and the old man next to him look unfazed?

"My patience has run out." The Graylash member said as his hands started to light up blue, and lightning struck out, not just from him, but from all twenty of the Graylash members straight down the middle.

The power looked far stronger than anything they had seen before, and the others weren‚Äôt exactly sure they were going to survive this one. Linda raised her shadow but couldn‚Äôt spread it beyond anyone else.

The others were ready with an attack of their own, but a single man stood in front of them all, and the only thing they could see beyond the bright light of the attack, was his ponytail hair.

He placed his hands on the floor, and a flash of white light shone so bright nobody could see anything. When they peeked through as the white light seemed to fade, they were wondering why didn‚Äôt they feel any pain, what had just happened.

"I was planning to stay out of this whole thing, but when you almost hurt me like that, then I will have to take part," Eno said. His eyes were glowing bright red.

"Unlike the others behind me, I have no problems with killing humans."
