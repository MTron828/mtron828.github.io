Chapter 1236 I picked a side

"I didn't believe it, but you're really rooting against your own kind? Seeing one of us turn traitor is interesting in its own way and I look forward to finding out one way or the other what they did to you. Still, let me ask you, do you really think that Slicer will lose?" Graham asked.

Hearing this, Quinn thought that Graham was oddly confident. It was hard to tell through camera the sheer battle that was going on, but Quinn thought for sure that Slicer had to be at her limit, especially after she had seemingly fallen into a frenzied state making her harm herself.

Now experiencing fighting as a Dalki, Quinn could guess how far a Dalki could push themselves, even with the added energy from blood loss, and strength it could only take them so far.

"She can push herself further. Maybe one more will do." Graham mumbled. "That Demon tier Armour has been troublesome, but we are stronger than Demon tier beasts."

Hearing this, from someone who Quinn had suffered a humiliating defeat against, he could believe it. However, they were going against a man that had a full set of Demon tier Armour, this person was also stronger than Demon tier beasts.

It was then, for the third time in the fight, that Slicer chose to hurt herself. Her latest tail proved to be more resilient than the previous ones, forcing her to attack it multiple times, before it fell to the ground.

Without the Disruptive pulse, Hislton was being careful to get close. After all, all he needed to do was bide his time.

More blood stained the ground and it took a while for another tail to replace the old one. Through the blood loss, she felt her mind hazing. In order to snap out of it, she stomped both feet on the ground. Screaming soon after, the tail could be seen moving, it was the original size of the first one, but didn't stop there. Under her pained shrieks it slowly continued to elongate until reaching three times her body size. The scales on her body had been ruined, her inner bones had been broken multiple times but had healed again and again.

Her energy was at an all-time high, but she was struggling to keep her mind clear. Still her eyesight was set on the enemy in front of her. She could practically feel the sixth spike coming after defeating him.

'It's there‚Ä¶I know it's there‚Ä¶I will be the first one‚Ä¶the strongest one!'

Charging in like she had done before, she was ready to come in, and when she was within range, she spun her body, and the large tails spun with her, at the last second the large tail connected to her, extended out coming down on Hilston like a hammer.

'This is it, with this attack, the armour will be charged again!' Hilston believed, teleporting into place, and raising his arms so they were in the right position. He had a huge grin on his face as he was ready to use Disruptive pulse the moment it would be available.

However, this time there was no 'clang' sound at all. Instead, his hands were no longer attached to his body, cut off cleanly they were now lying in the sand. It didn't stop there, as the colossal tail was used for another strike. Following his instincts, Hilston didn't even try to use an ability, instead jumping back. Despite its size, Slicer's newest tail was faster than any of the others. It hit the chest piece, leaving behind a giant slash, from which diamonds dropped to the ground.

As this happened, Hilston could feel the accumulated energy fade away. Using the distance he had just won, Hilston teleported himself out of there, as far as he could. It was done in a panic and he didn't really register that he was falling back.

Seeing this, Slicer extended her tail and swung her body in a circle, cutting everything around, another clang was heard, and Hilston was seen being flung through the air, falling to the ground. His armour that he had worn this whole time had been cut in half. Due to how heavy it was, it had fallen off him falling to the ground. Now a large wound was visible across his entire torso, painting it red.

"The Dalki, it's gotten so much stronger." Sam gasped. "Hilston, he's‚Ä¶he's going to lose!"

"No, that can't be! How could he lose to a lizard like that?! He was just caught off guard, he had to be tired after how long they were fighting for." Vicky sounded like she was now making up excuses for him.

"That's not it. I've never seen Hilston take a fight so seriously before." Pai spoke. "If it was the old Hilston, he would have lost this fight a lot sooner, but he actually fought with great tactics, his moves were faster and he had access to some of the strongest abilities in the world. It's just‚Ä¶ the power of the Dalki was stronger‚Ä¶" ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

It was something hard to admit, and even though her twin brother Pai was saying these words, she still didn't believe it. Hilston had to still have something up his sleeve, something that would turn this fight around, she just knew it.

Void soon zoomed the camera into Hilston's wound, his body was far more hurt then the others thought as well. They could see it now the armour had fallen off. Despite the armour he was wearing, his body was swollen and bruised from all the attacks, all showing different colours. Despite blocking them his body still ended up like this. The force of the blows were unimaginable.

That was when on the camera itself, it had picked a certain person, who was standing there by Hilston side. It appeared suddenly.

They could only see the back of his head, but the others knew who it was.

"Sil!" Sam shouted out.

Sam wanted to stop him, but he knew that if he tried to get in Sil's way what could he honestly do. No amount of thinking in this situation would help them.

"Isn't this one of the ones from the Cursed faction? I've seen them fighting a few times on Bonny's live stream." A user commented.

"Yeah I think she said that he was a Blade as well, only working for the Cursed faction. Has he come to help?"

"With the two of them, maybe they can defeat the five spiked Dalki. Yeah, we can win this fight, beating one of their strongest!"

"But if he's actually strong, then why did he come join the fight only now? Couldn't he have come to support the Blade guy in the middle of it? Also, why is he just standing there?"

The online community was in high spirits, until they could see Sil looking at Hilston on the ground, not turning to look at the Dalki for even a second. At the same time the spinning from Slicer's attack had caused her to be slightly wobbly on her feet as well. She knew the condition her opponent was in, so he wasn't going anywhere soon.

"I've always dreamed about this moment. I've thought about what I would say to you, if I ever got this chance. For the longest time, I just wanted you to tell me why you did everything you did. Why you decided to put everyone through that on Blade Island. There had to be a reason, right? A reason that could justify your actions‚Ä¶ but is there really anything that can justify everything you did? One day, the hope inside me that there might be one, just disappeared, so there is no point asking you that."

"You don't deserve to live another second on this planet, you're just a crazy weak old man! This is for Caser! I never forgot what you did to him that day, and now I am going to do the same to you." Sil said his piece, before Hilston could even react to him appearing. After shoving his hand through Hilton's chest, he pulled out a still beating heart.

"Goodbye, 'gran‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶father'." Sil spat mockingly before he squeezed the organ in his hand, causing it to pop on the spot.
