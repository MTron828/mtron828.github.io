Chapter 1850: The last of Pure.

After the first war with the Dalki, many of the large continents from before were nonexistent. Due to fights, large spaceship blasts, attempted nuclear missiles that had backfired, and more, it had caused much of the land to split and the sea levels to rise.

Some of the land had simply been sunk into the sea or had burst into nothing but particles to go into space or the layer of atmosphere around the world. However, what this did was cause many islands to appear all over the place.

Many of them were left unexplored due to the fact they were just too small to make a settlement or a Shelter on. So they just stayed there, doing nothing.

Currently, both Sera and Leo were staying on the island together. It was a full day before they were due to fight. The island had a sandy white beach and jungle-like areas in some places, but most of the island actually had next to nothing on it. There were just open spaces where nothing would grow and large rocks that were left in place. In total, to walk around the entire island, it would take about two hours. For a vampire with super speed and who could run, it would take hardly any time at all.

Currently, the two of them were in one of the large empty spaces. The ground was still sand, but there was a large rock that Sera was relaxing on, with a number of his weapons laid out on the side of the rock next to him.

Leo was on his own with his blade held in his hand. He didn't do much but once in a while he would unsheathe the blade and just cut the air. A sharp sound was heard, a high pitched noise that hurt even Sera's ears.

"Why are you even training so hard?" Sera had to ask, frustrated as the sound was getting to him. He had heard it over and over again and thought his conversation would at least put it to a stop for a second.

"Ever since I met you, all you do every day, whenever you have spare time is train. If you have a spare second you train, and now when you should be resting for a big upcoming fight, you are training again."

"Are you some type of robot, has your creator given you a task to do nothing but endlessly train all day, when you are in front of me of something."

"Because, being with you makes me feel bad for doing nothing and do you really think anything you do in the next two days is going to make a difference?"

Leo didn't reply for a second, and once again, after around eight seconds he did another strike again, making the same sound as before.

"Since I have been practicing this strike, my timing and speed has improved by 0.02 seconds. Before I had become a vampire, I believed my body had hit its peak."

"No, in fact, my body had begun to worsen. My reflexes, my attacks, everything was slower."

"On top of that, no matter how much I trained, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop it. Do you know how depressing it is when your hard work is producing no results?

"I had to accept the fact that I had gone past my peak and I would never be the man I once was."

"Now, my body is different, my hard work is rewarded. I haven't reached my peak and even now I am able to improve my speed." VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

"By 0.02 seconds. Are you listening to yourself? Do you really think that's going to make a difference?"

"Why don't you try improving in other ways? Drinking some blood, or becoming some top vampire or something" Sera complained.

"Today I have improved by a fraction, but all these small improvements will add up, and one day I believe it can be the difference between life and death."

"Either way, I do this to remind myself that my body has not yet reached its peak, that there is still room to grow."

Sera folded his arms, but he soon looked to his side and picked up a dagger from the rock, throwing it out as hard as he could and he had aimed it towards Leo.

Immediately, Leo saw the energy thrown at him through his ability, he turned his head and drew his blade at the right moment. He knew that the power of his Qi and the impact of his sword would not be enough, so he had no choice but to use his vampire aura.

Hitting the dagger upward, he had deflected it. It spun in the air but soon started to move back down and headed straight towards Leo, ready to strike him again. A clang was heard as the knife was hit, time and time again, and the dagger, no matter how many times it was being deflected, continued to come back.

"That there that you are fighting against, is an intermediate tier beast dagger." Sera explained.

"It has an active ability to move towards its target when thrown, no matter where they are. That's it. Usually after getting knocked once, the dagger is useless."

"But of course, in my hands, it has become a demon tier dagger."

"It's now just as strong as a demon tier weapon, which is why you are unable to break it, and it's also why its simple active skill has become quite useful in this situation."

"It will continue to attack you until either I tell it to stop, or until you are dead. Now this is what I call power."

"Maybe, rather than just focusing on your body for improvement, you should try and increase your vampire powers or something similar to it."

"In fact, I have an offer for you. I can tell that you care a lot about this fight, and these people that we are about to meet, they are strong right? So then I have two offers for you."

"One, give me your weapon before they arrive and I can boost it to the demon tier level for you."

It was the first time Leo had heard Sera make such an offer, he didn't know it was possible for him to boost other weapons other than the ones he was using, yet here he had learned that he could.

"Then here is my second offer to you. I haven't met someone that I have liked in a very very long time, and I like you, Leo."

"If you choose to be my subordinate and follow me, then I will give you the power you need to defeat whoever you wish. I can promise you that on my name as God of War."

Hearing the second offer, Leo turned his head away immediately. "I'm afraid i can not. It's not that I don't like you, and perhaps in another world, at another time, if the two of us met, I would accept your offer."

"But right now my allegiance is to only one person, and that is Quinn Talen. So I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer."

"I thought as much." Sera smiled as he laid by the rock and stopped his flying knife from attacking. It went back to where Sera was and he had caught it in his hand placing it back down. The whole time while talking, Leo was deflecting the blade. His concentration was beyond normal people.

"But think about the first offer, I know you wish to do this with your own power, but everything we use, even our very existence is borrowed from something even if that is the energy of the universe itself."

Although Leo hadn't planned to take any of the offers that had been made by Sera, his words did get him thinking. Leo had been training, in many ways the same way as he had always done. He felt that it was because it allowed him to improve, but maybe there was a better way, and a way to increase other aspects.

Sitting down on the sand Leo started to meditate, he started to focus on the energy inside his body. He could see the yellow Qi energy swirling around, and also the red energy in its body, but it looked a little unstable.

"It has felt this way for a while now, as if the blood energy is too much for this body to handle, but is there something I can do?"

Focusing, Leo sat there for a while, an hour went past, and eventually a loud grunt was heard from the sand, Immediately, Sera got up from his rocks and jumped over landing in front of Leo. He could see his face, the veins running through his neck, and the flask that contained human blood in it had been consumed.

"Are you okay?" Sera asked.

"Yes... I am better than okay." Leo said, lifting his head. The worst part was already over and he had been enduring the pain for a while now. Leo could feel it, his whole body felt better, stronger, faster.

"I have evolved." Leo had successfully evolved from a vampire knight, and had finally, after a long wait, become a vampire lord. He was ready for Zero and Chris if they were to step foot on the island.
