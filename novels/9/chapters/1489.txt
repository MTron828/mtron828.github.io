Chapter 1490 - It Starts Here (Part 2)

Every bone in Bonny's body was shaking, and it was for more reasons than one. The reporter herself wasn't sure if it was due to fear or the excitement of a good story. When looking around as well, she still didn't know what was causing the two different emotions in her.

Looking around, the room was filled with all sorts of creatures, but her mind was racing, thinking about what they might be planning to do with them after the information she had just been told. Rather than seeing what was actually in front of her.

Void had seen this look on Bonny many times. It was one of her charms, but also at times it would allow the two of them to face unpredictable dangers.

"I told you I was right." Bonny whispered, elbowing Void in his side. However, her friend seemed far too distracted to reply. He held the camera firmly in his hand, and he seemed to be mouthing words, or repeating them over and over.

'You're just filming a movie, that's all this all is. You're just filming a movie.' Void kept reminding himself as he captured everything in there on film.

Still, Bony wouldn't let her partner get her down. It seemed like her instincts were right, and something big was about to happen. Of course, they couldn't tell them about the attack before hand, just in case they planned to leak it so soon.

"There are so many different looking creatures here." Bonny exclaimed.

The creatures or vampire subclasses had been kept behind reinforced glass. Somewhat similar to what was used at the event. The glass divided the different areas that would have the different dangerous subclasses in them. In a way, it felt somewhat similar to visiting a zoo on Earth‚Ä¶ only that everything inside could and was dying to kill you.

Most of the compartments the creatures were stored in were the same, just a piece of land with a few trees here and there, but there were also a few that were quite different. They had cave-like designs or even some large bodies of water.

Apparently, some Subclasses required a more unique environment.

"Indeed." Sunny nodded. "And we will be using all of them to help us in this upcoming fight."

The first container they walked up to, Bonny could see tall, skinny creatures. Their skin was pale, almost grey in colour. Their eyes were sunken in and all of them were bald.

They lacked any muscle on their bodies, giving them quite the skeleton-like figure, but what looked horrifying was their eyes that were all just a shade of white.

"Wendigos." Sunny answered even though no one had asked, at least not yet. "These creatures have incredible regeneration capabilities and despite their looks, they have enough strength to back it up as well. These are the most common type and will make up the bulk of our army."

When looking at how large the facility was, and how many subclasses there were, Bonny estimated there to be around 10,000 creatures in total in a place like this. Sure, it was nothing compared to the human population, but against the Dalki they needed strength more than numbers.

It was then, one of the Wendigos started clawing at the glass, banging on it, and a few more started running over as they stared at Bonny and Void. It seemed like Void's little sutra was no longer effective, as the cameraman was startled and started to back up slowly.

"Don't worry, they're not strong enough to break that. Go away!" Sunny shouted and for some reason, it seemed like they listened to her.

Still, Void being scared continued to back up, step by step, until he heard a loud bang from behind. He jumped up and nearly dropped his camera. Still, he was a professional and caught it quickly. As soon as he did, he turned around to see what had scared him.

A large creature that looked to be made of nothing but flesh, on all fours. It would open its mouth from time to time, which would split into several parts. What was scary about it was what looked like skulls on their stomach.

"A Mouth Spitter, fast, agile, and they have a special trick up their sleeve for certain opponents. Come on, let's continue this little tour." Sunny explained, as she continued to show them around the place.

The two humans quickly followed, as they were a little worried about being away from the only one that seemed to be able to control them. Next up on the right side in another glass container, there were multiple trees inside.

It looked similar to a forest but the truck of the trees were large and looked to all be slightly carved. Zooming in with his camera, Void was able to get a better look at what they were and could see a creature holding its knees. It was covered in dark fur and its head looked almost like an owl, yet its body resembled that of a human.

It was rocking back and forth, and large wings behind could be seen.

"Those will be part of our Air Force, the Strzyga. Be careful though, if they manage to catch you they will eat your body from inside out, leaving your skin for last. They have a tendency to pretend to be human. They can't fully talk, but they can put together a few sentences here and there, similar to that of a parrot."

"Are all the creatures here dangerous?" Bonny asked, thinking how the Wendigo's had acted and based on what Sunny had told them.

"Yes, however, I'm able to control them somewhat. My ability allows me to even communicate with their human side, I guess or vampire side. Normal voices don't seem to reach them but mine does. However, when they see humans, their thirst for blood, flesh, gets the better of them.

"Which is exactly why they will be perfect against the Dalki." ùíÇll new stùíêries at n0ve/lbi/ùíè(.)cùíêm

Turning to the opposite container. Void was trying to get a look at some other creatures. They had been in here a while now, and he felt more confident that there wouldn't be a breakout. That's when he spotted something resembling a goat with a large horse-like head. So far it was the most normal of the creatures he had seen.

For this one, he had gotten quite close to the glass, trying to capture their every detail. When getting closer, it opened its mouth and its tongue lashed out, hitting the glass. It spread out like an octopus body and started pulsating.

"You're lucky the glass is there. That's a Sigbin. Just like most other creatures it feeds off of blood, but it can actually absorb your blood even through the glass, so I would be careful." Sunny warned.

The tour continued with Sunny explaining all the dangerous subclasses, for a total of fifteen different kinds. None of them normal, and the things they could do would give children nightmares for months.

When the tour ended, it looked like Sunny's two assistants had gone off to do some work, and they could hear the sound of spaceships starting on the outside.

"You two came here via your own spaceship, correct? Just like the time before, it would be best if you filmed this fight from above. As I said, I can't control them when humans are around. Naturally, I hope you can cut these details from your report. We don't want to scare the humans." Sunny requested.

"We understand." Bonny nodded, waiting for more to be said, but the only thing that followed was an awkward silence between the two.

"You two should start moving now. Because in a second, all of these creatures will be released. That was my signal to tell you we are going into battle now, and it would be good if you could start filming from this point onwards as well." Sunny smiled.

She didn't have to say it twice, both Bonny and Void started running, heading out of the facility, but the smile couldn't stop showing on Bonny's face.

'The Dalki, they won't know what's coming to hit them!' Bonny thought.
