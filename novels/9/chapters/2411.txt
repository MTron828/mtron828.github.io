The giant pit was the size of a few large arenas that had been put together. At first it didn't quite make sense due to how few people there were in the cellar, but as they found out that the cellar was used for more people it made some sense. 

When the fighting started, it made even more sense. Since large scale skills, deadly weapons and werewolves were all battling against each other nearly every day. Yet, never had the large pit taken a beating like it had done today.

The pit looked nothing like it had looked before, it was completely destroyed left, right, and centre. There were large holes in some places, creating another pit. At the same time, the perfect circle hole, now had all sorts of different shapes as part of the wall was destroyed and more importantly, there seemed to no longer be any exit. 

The cellar that led to the staircase, heading to the outside, had been destroyed and was covered in rubble. Due to all the fighting going on, it had collapsed completely. Now, the only clear entrance they could see was the hole above them. 

For a moment, Chris was looking up at the large hole above, wondering how long it would take for him to escape out of here, or would he be stopped before that even happened. Having these thoughts in his head, even for a split second, he felt ashamed of himself. 

He looked in front at the demon king Unzoku, who was completely unharmed, he only had a few pieces of rubble on his skin that fell off. The power of his steps would cause the ground to vibrate slightly, shaking off everything that was on his body.  Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

'Hikel is doing a good job keeping the werewolves off my back and that Champion busy, which means that I need to do my part as well.'

Before Unzoku could say anything, or gather his surrounding energy, Chris ran forward, instead of running in a straight line though, he was using his Qi to create platforms, and it looked like he was pouncing from side to side in the air.

He pounced quickly from one area to another going across Unzoku's side, and let out his claws to rip through the side of his skin. Not checking how much damage had been done, or whether or not Unzoku was in a position to strike, Chris pounced again striking the demon king's back this time. 

Like a pinball, Chris was bouncing all over Unzoku's body, and was letting his claws do the work. The direct physical attacks were doing the most damage, as he could feel his claws ripping through the skin. 

'I have to keep attacking, I have to keep moving as much as I can.' Chris thought, he was just focusing as he attacked whatever he could see. 

Moving as fast as he could, even what he was seeing was a relative blur to Chris, he was unable to process it, yet he was attacking by instinct with all of his power. 

'I can feel it, the energy around me is moving, that means he's planning to attack!' Chris thought. 

His armour started to light up, and just as Chris had guessed, Unzoku's claw was swung out. It completely missed as it went through the air, destroying more of the arena around them. 

"You really are an interesting one, I am no slower than you, yet you are still able to avoid my attack!" Unzoku said. 

Despite missing all of his attacks, despite being hit non stop for the last minute or so, there wasn't even a hint of worry in his voice, but Chris had to ignore all of that, he couldn't hesitate. 

'Thanks to my Qi training, I can sense the energy in the air. The downside of the demon armour due to how fast the demon king strikes, I have to activate the skill before he attacks. He hasn't noticed it yet, but the energy in the air changes just before he strikes, allowing me to use armour's skill, but if I get hit once, I'll be done for.'

The armour skill didn't have a cool down time, but it did have a slight delay before it could be used. For most, those with normal eyes, they wouldn't be able to tell. It was only apparent in high level fights where every moment counted. 

It was an armour that was more so meant to block large scale attacks, ones that needed time to be prepared, but when one was going against an opponent, where every attack was a large scale one, what was he meant to do?I think you should take a look at

Chris continued on with his momentum, attacking again and again, and just like before he could feel the energy moving and Unzoku going in for another attack. His armour lit up phasing through the attack. 

As this happened though, Chris quickly noticed the air was still moving. The arms of Unzoku were swinging rapidly again and again at where Chris was. 

"Couldn't you tell, I've been going easy on you this whole time. I like to play with my meals, especially one as interesting as you." Unzoku said, continuing to swing his arms, Chris was disappearing and trying his best to move away but he was being chased by the claws that were moving all over the place. 

"For me, I have to bring out the best in you, push you until you are at your strongest and then, and only then, when I eat you, I will grow!"

Having just phased through one attack, another claw came right down after it, and this time Chris was unprepared. He swung both his arms out at the single claw. The strike had hit both of them, but Chris felt his internals being hit by the claw. 

His body was sent flying back in the air, and this time it was him who ended up crashing into the side of the wall. 

"Crap!" Chris said, as he coughed out blood. He had great internal injuries and his body was trying its best to heal them as quickly as possible. If he was hit by one more attack of the same calibre he would be done for.

"You, I can tell just by your smell." Unzoku said, as he stood there still in the same position. It was only then that Chris realised something. All of the attacks he had dealt so far, all of them had been healed and there wasn't a scratch on his body. 

On top of that, he had never moved from his position, even while striking at Chris. 

"I think you can tell now, that there is a huge difference between our levels." Unzoku said. "You see, it's not because I am the first, or because I have support from Immortui. You should know that others are capable of surpassing the original. Look at the vampire's history themselves. 

"But, there is an important aspect of us werewolves for us to get stronger, and that is, we need to eat the strong. We have unlimited potential, and can continue to grow and grow as long as we eat, yet you… you refuse to, with that you will never grow stronger!"

Chris started to move out from the rubble but as he did, he noticed his armour was cracked, it started to fall to pieces on the ground. The demon tier armour he was using to phase through the demon king's attack, had broken.
