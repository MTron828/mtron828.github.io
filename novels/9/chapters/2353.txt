From JKSManga. 

Hi everyone, I just wanted to let you know that this month is my wedding month on July 20th! I have just had my Bachelors party for the last few days which was why there has been a lack of chapters. 

This month will perhaps be one of the busiest months of my life, but I wish to bring you all as many chapters as possible, especially as we get into the last part of My Vampire System, but I just wanted to make you all aware.

A portal had fully broken through, which meant that there was now a connection between the two worlds. Slowly creatures from one were pouring into the other. Some were attracted by the strange energy and the breath of air that was leaking into theirs from the other one. 

While others had been ordered to head in, in an attempt to break through, by the current leader of the world, the one known as Immortui.

Moving from his position, the power spread throughout the universe, a large darkened red mist was floating around, and those living in the world felt uneasy. As they felt the movement. 

'This is the closest I have ever been to getting out of here… it has been a long time coming.' Immortui thought. 

Soon, those on other planets, recognised the large enigma that was moving, and went ahead to join Immortui, moving along with him. 

"The portal, it's only a matter of time until a rift capable of containing your power will open." One of them said. "A permanent rift will then be open between our two worlds allowing us to travel in and out."

"Our power will grow and we will be able to take control of both worlds, and soon we can do as we wish, set up our own systems and have the world set to the way it was meant to be." Another creature said. 

"None of that matters." Immortui replied. "Most importantly, those that have been suppressing me, those that feared me and trapped me in this place as punishment, will finally get what is coming to them. 

"The great satisfaction I will feel, seeing everything they built up crumble right in front of them. That is what I strive for, and nothing else."

The two that continued to travel next Immortui nodded. 

"We have sent two Demon Generals to deal with the situation, do you think it will be enough?" One of them asked. "Will they be able to defeat the one named Quinn? From what we know, he is quite strong, but the Demon Generals are strong as well."

Immortui started to laugh at this comment. 

"I very much doubt he will have trouble with one of the Demon Generals. He has beaten one with ease in the past, and although I have given them a lot more power, I still don't think it will be enough to defeat him. 

"He is a strong one for a reason, what I am looking to do is to buy some time. That's all we need to do. Last time, I thought it was inevitable the portal would be opened up.

"I had no clue there was one that had learned how to use the magic circles, and on top of that, Mundus went to deal with me directly. Delaying my actions to act myself to make sure things were a success.

"This time though, even though the portal has been open for some time, there have been no reports of Mundus appearing. From what we know, this seems to be due to the deal that had been made with the celestials.

"To not intervene with Earth's affairs. The deal that was made may very well be their downfall, for the Celestials and Quinn."

The large floating power of energy, and the two by his side continued to move, and the rift could be seen right up ahead. It was perfect, it had been a long time since Immortui had been to earth.

———

Due to the large trap that had been made by Magnus, both Edvard and Hikel had been hit. The ability of Edvard hadn't come through for him, but then again he had probably already used up a lot of his luck in the fight so far. 

Out of the two originals, the first one to fall to his knees was Edvard. He reached out grabbing the centipede-like hand, holding it, he tried to push it away, but nearly all of his energy was drained completely, there was next to no resistance. 

"Haha!" Magnus laughed. "Right now, my power is pumping through your whole body, destroying every single one of our cells. This is nothing compared to how much I had placed inside that person from earlier that you saved. 

"I know you originals are a little too persistent and quite durable, so I will make sure that you're unable to move an inch before I pull out my arms." 

Looking to his right, Edvard could see that Hikel was in the same situation, he wasn't quite on his knees but his legs were wobbly, while his hands were holding onto the head of the pincers of the hand. 

'If it continues on like this, then we won't make it… no matter what, I have to try and do something.' Edvard thought. 

However, the one to act was Hikel. 

"This is going to hurt, so I didn't want to do this." 

There was a large wound on his stomach, but with his hands he pressed it against the sharp fangs, cutting up his hands more. In this situation, he did the only thing he could do.

·ƈθm 'Blood explode!' 

All of the blood was lighting up all over Hikel, and soon went off in a large explosion. 

"Hikel!" Edvard shouted. 

He had a good guess how Hikel was feeling because they were going through the same thing. Although this plan might work, it meant that Hikel would experience the power of his explosions as well, and with the poison weakening him, it would be hard for him to recover and he would take on more damage.

The centipede-like hand was seen pulling away, with part of its shell destroyed and one of the pIncer's as well. 

"Damn it, I never planned for him to try a suicide attack like that." Magnus said, but was still satisfied with the end result. 

As the smoke cleared, Hikel was seen on one knee huffing and panting, blood over his head and more. His arms looked like they had been blown apart, they were in bad shape and they weren't healing at all.

"I'll help you Edvard, just let me catch my breath for a second." Hikel answered. 

Edvard thought he was crazy, he was in no situation to worry about another, but that was until he saw something in one of his hands. It was a metallic flask, with the letter VIII written on them. 

'I know that flask, wait a second, how does Hikel even have that… he never said he had anything before, has he been buying it on the black market as well? Wait, wa he that mysterious bidder who out bid me for it that time!'

It wasn't the time for Edvard to think about these things, and Hikel had acted fast as he took in the blood. Following his eyes, he could see that Hikel was trying to say something else as well. There was something that he had failed to notice in the explosion. 

Looking down at the ground, Edvard could see another silver flask, right by his foot. 

'Is this his as well… when did he, how much of this did he buy…did he use all of his fortune to get this?'

There were a lot of mixed feelings in Edvard at the moment but he couldn't think about that, he slammed his foot on the ground hitting up a piece of dirt that lifted the flask in the air. 

Letting go with one hand, he caught the flask and ripped open the lid with his mouth, gulping down the green blood instantly. As it powered through his body, he could feel it somewhat combatting the energy of whatever it was that Magnus was putting in him. 

With the surge of power, he pushed the pincers out from his stomach and slammed its head on the floor.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"Damn it!" Magnus shouted, as he retracted both of his hands. "Both of you, still used that cursed power of the Dalki! How weak do you have to be!"

"Do you really think you can say anything!" Hikel stated, fully recovered, he jumped up in the air and swung his arm. Blood came out from his wound and started to explode but not right at Magnus but in front of him. 

Immediately, going through the smoke was Edvard who delivered a strong punch right to his stomach. Then, kneeling down he pushed with his hands off the floor while his legs hit Magnus right in the head. 

"Your power is borrowed as well, at least ours is only temporary… and we don't have to follow anyone for it!" Edvard shouted. 

Hikel had his arms stretched out and was aiming carefully. He had used his blood control to gather his real blood in the palm of his hand, and then fired it out, similar to the skill blood cannon, but rather than his blood aura it was his actual blood lighting up with his power. 

The blood hit the arms of Magnus and exploded, causing the hard outer casings to fall from his hands and himself to fall to the ground. 

"You think, this is enough!" Magnus said, getting up from the floor. "Enough to kill me, you were unable to kill me back then, and now I am even stronger than before." 

"There is a big difference between now and then." Edvard said. 

A figure appeared, jumping right behind him, holding a greatsword in the air, and his large hand enhanced. 

"Back then, you had people on your side, but right now, there is no one on your side, while we have all the help we need!"

The person with the large arm was none other than Andy. Hikel had given a flask to Andy also. It had helped him heal, so there was a chance that it would help him to become stronger as well. 

With his giant hand and the greatsword, it swung down. Magnus lifted both his hands, but the sheer strength of the blade sliced through them and continued cutting Magnus right in half, stopping at the midway point through his body. 

It was peeling apart, half and half, with no sign of life in his eyes any longer, as his body stood there. A former king, and a dedicated follower of Immortui, who had dealt them so much trouble had been dealt with there and then.
