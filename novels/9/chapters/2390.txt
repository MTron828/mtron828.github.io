The hunting grounds and the camp itself was no longer what it used to be. Before there were clear borders to where the base would be, a wall that was built around with bases and more, but all of that had broken down and was just a part of the rubble that was around them. 

 Even the great forest, that looked like it was made for giants, with roots that were deeply integrated into the ground had been pulled up, half destroyed, or disintegrated and all of it was just from the shockwaves of the battle. 

They hadn't been attacked directly, yet all of it was destroyed due to the battle between two greats. If it was a planet with the same structure as Earth, it left no doubt that perhaps all of the landmass, an entire country, or maybe even part of the planet itself would have been destroyed.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The structure of the planet they were on was just different, it was as if the planet itself had adapted due to all of the fighting that occurred on it, allowing it to become more tolerant of such attacks, but not one of this scale. 

Out of the great battle, there was only one left standing, the one left the winner, and they stood still looking down at their enemy.

'He's still in the same form as before, and he hasn't moved for a while." Calva thought. 'This just confirms my guess from before. He's not conscious, unlike he was before, he was just fighting on instinct, but now that there is no enemy, I thought he might have turned back. 

'I was watching the fight carefully, there was a trigger and that was when the demon king had transformed, it must have triggered the demon transformation or that intruder didn't think he could beat him without going into this form. 

'If he hasn't turned back now that the demon king is dead, it means one of two things. One, that he still has a lot of energy to keep up the form he is currently in, and he needs to tire out somehow. Or we need to get through to him for him to turn back.' 

The problem with the latter was, that method would often only work if someone was close to him, or knew a lot about the attacker, but it was most likely that Quinn was strangers to all of them. 

'For now, the best thing to do is stay in this range. If we move, we could catch his attention, and if we go in closer there is a good chance he could attack us.'

Calva didn't know his relation to the other Skullys, but he did seem to be somewhat considerate of them during the fight, and it was the same for them as well.

"The demon king is dead, does that mean the hunting games are over!" 

"That stranger did it, that man did it!"

"Yes, he did, we have to thank him!" 

The Skullys were overjoyed, and since their long time enemy had been defeated, they started to climb through their destroyed trees and moved directly to the floor and headed toward their saviour. 

"No, wait!" Calva said, reaching with his hand out. Sweat was running down the side of his face, he wanted to stop them but his own legs wouldn't move. 

As the Skullys had entered what used to be the camp, Quinn's head had moved from looking at the dead demon king for the first time. His head tilted and now was staring in the direction of the oncoming Skullys. The expression on his face was a dead stare, and suddenly the corner of his cheeks rose up. 

The red blood wings flapped once out wide. In doing so, particles of blood had splattered out and were floating about in the air. Seeing this, even the Skullys stopped dead in their tracks. 

"Wait… wait, is he going to attack us… but I thought we were on the same side." 

"I knew it, it was just demons fighting against other demons."I think you should take a look at

Not all of the Skullys had come out of the forest, they were too afraid after what they had seen, but a good amount of around ten had done so. Wishing to thank Quinn or to see the dead demon that had tormented them on the ground, and now they were regretting their actions. 

"Ple-"

Before the Skully could finish its sentence, all ten of them dropped to the floor, with a bullet hole through their hard outer skull that stuck out from their heads. In an instant all of them had been killed. 

"No..." Anon shook his head, he and the others had stayed next to Calva for the time being, they could also somewhat feel something was wrong compared to the person they had met before. "This isn't what was meant to happen, he was meant to help us take out Immortui once and for all, not be another threat to us."

"That's justy what happens in this place." Calva said. "You can't rely on others, and in the end, it's just a world that is survival of the fittest where if you aren't strong, you can't do anything yourself."

However, the worst was about to happen, because after killing the Skullys that had come out towards him, Quinn was now looking deeper into the forest. The smile was still present on his face. In a blink he was no longer standing next to the dead body of the demon king. 

Instead he was in the forest, and his hand had swiped right through another Skullys neck, causing the head to fall straight to the floor. The other Skullys started to retreat back deeper into the forest, one had turned its back but a dark hand had already pierced through the centre of its chest. 

Quinn lifted the Skully in the air, and the blood from the Skully was dripping down his arm. It wasn't falling to the floor, it was as if it was attached to the skin of Quinn. When it eventually went onto his pale white skin the body had absorbed the blood and his eyes glowed brighter for a moment. 

'Is that the source of his power, the blood.' Calva thought. 'If it is, it means as long as he keeps killing and getting blood, he's going to be in this form for a long time.'

"If we move, we die, if we stay still, we die, what are we meant to do now!" Tuni said. "Quinn is even more dangerous than the demon king, if we couldn't beat the demon king, how are we going to beat him?"

"Fighting is the only option." Calva the champion said. "If you want to live, then fight.:"

The champion had to act whether he liked it or not.
