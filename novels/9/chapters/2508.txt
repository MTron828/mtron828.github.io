Chapter 2509 ¬†Quinn vs Immortui the second round

Quinn had managed to connect with his inner self, he was feeling the energy flowing through him and in turn he was feeling the energy of all the blood that was being spilt not just on this planet, but throughout the universe.

With the demon blood, and the battle going on between the Divine Brigade, the demons, and the inhabitants, a lot of blood was being spilt all over. Quinn was gathering all of that power and there was now a large orb of power that had gathered and condensed around him.

'I can feel it, I know I'm close to controlling blood just like when I had evolved into my celestial form. If I'm like this, then maybe I won't have to consume the other demon king's blood!' Opening his eyes. They were all a solid colour of red, blood was dripping down his face, but it wasn't rolling off.

"Hahaha!" Immortui laughed, looking at the situation. Instead of attacking Quinn, he too had gathered the power in the air, the red mist from when he first came here, and the ever increasing power of death that was occurring.

With all the battles going on, the people, the inhabitants, were constantly dying and adding to his power as well.

"Seeing this, I knew I was right." Immortui smiled. "I knew you would have the power to take me back to that space! Finally you have reached the stage where you will be useful to me!"

Lifting his hand up, from the large orb of blood power, a tornado of blood aura shot out heading straight for Immortui. Standing there, he swung his arm and a portal of red mist opened up. A giant hand came out, and with its palm open, took the blood vortex head on.

As the giant red mist hand closed its fist, the vortex disappeared into particles, but that wasn't the only thing that Quinn was preparing.

Several more vortexes of blood from the giant orb of blood went out and were heading straight for Immortui, and in turn he opened up portals of red mist and giant limbs came out to defend against them.

They swung, clashing with the vortexes of blood, and each time the two powers collided, a giant shockwave of aura would be sent out in both directions.

"Which is stronger, your power of blood, or mine of death? You certainly are a strong one that I managed to raise!" Immortui soon noticed the giant blood sword that had been made in the sky.

It pierced through the clouds, as if a giant from above had dropped its large sword, it fell with great force. Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com

Both of Immortui's hands started to wrap around with the serpents on his back. Then a little above his head, two incredibly large red mist portals had opened. Ones far larger than the last ones he had created.

Forming out from the mist portals were two gigantic arms rather than just part of the hands. They had appeared above Immortui. On a closer inspection, it looked like the pattern of a black serpent was on the hands as well.

As the giant sword fell, Immortui grabbed it with his two giant arms of power, stopping it in its place. It continued to head down and the giant arms looked as if they were struggling slightly.

Out from the giant sword, several vortexes, looking somewhat like solar flares from the sun, came off and started to attack the fingers and the giant arms. It was hitting them and getting rid of the aura of power bit by bit.

The black serpents' aura on the giant arms started to move and had somewhat detached themselves from the arms, with part of their upper body having come off. Opening up its mouth, a pure power of aura, a laser, shot out from their mouths. It would hit the vortex breaking apart its power bit by bit.

Seeing this, Quinn then stretched out his arms, and the blood sword had exploded into several parts of just energy and particles. Sweeping his hands down, the aura moved as well, smothering the two arms and soon both of the giant objects had disappeared.

Unbeknownst to the two of them, as they were sending out large shockwaves of power, they had attracted some unwanted attention from the Divine Brigade. There were flocks of the Divine beings coming for Immortui from his end, and coming for Quinn from his as well.

For a split second, two of them turned around. Immortui swung his arm back, and a large red line that looked to tear space had appeared from his power of the mist. It had eliminated all of the Divine beings, cutting their bodies in half.

Meanwhile, Quinn had gathered power in his leg just like before, and as he spun his body, he unleashed a large kick in the air. Blood aura swipes larger and more powerful than before had also caused a large cut in space, eliminating the Divine beings as well.

"Look at you, look at how powerful you have become, thanks to me!" Immortui stated. "Don't you see for yourself, these celestial beings don't care about you, they don't care about anyone."

"They unleashed their army on us, and they are killing everything on sight. You should be able to tell with your blood powers. It's not just the demons these celestials are killing, but every life form."

"Think about it, if we weren't here in the red space, and were in the golden space, think about all the disaster that would befall all of us!"

The condensed orb of power had shrivelled down. Rather than out of his body, it was entering his body. The veins on Quinn were glowing with power. They were lighting up and could be seen through his pale skin.

Spreading out from his back, were pure wings made from blood aura, shining just as brightly.

"I don't agree with the celestial being's doings." Quinn said, as he walked forward taking a single step a ripples of blood aura spread out across the floor. All of the power was unable to be contained within his body.

"However, I don't agree with your doings either. I will get rid of you, I will keep my promise, and if the celestials chose to mess with me as well, I will get rid of them! I will do whatever it takes to protect those important to me!"

Running from his position, with each step, blood ripples appeared, sending waves throughout the area. Gathering around Quinn's arm, with his aura, was the image of the dragon, and the red blood shadow was starting to gather as well.

"You fool. I gave you a chance. You should know I haven't used my other powers so far." Immortui stated. "I thought you would have known that even your blood power is not greater than mine, it seems like you need to be taught another lesson."
