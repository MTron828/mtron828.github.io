There was no need for Quinn to go on and explain to Stark what he meant by making him faster; he was already intrigued. He remembered the last event and thought something was strange, to get a sudden boost like that.

Whatever the reason was, Stark knew that if he wished to improve, then this was the person that he needed to follow, and the look on his face already told Quinn he was convinced.

After a while, the King and Queen talked it out between each other, and they seemed to agree. They would only send in their very best to the war, and not force the public into a draft, but they were clear that they were taking the threat seriously.

While Quinn was away, these people would be trained and told what they were to face. In the meantime, Stark would get ready to leave the planet, so he was to head back and inform whoever he needed to inform. Then a communication device would be given to him so that the Penswi could communicate with Stark and Quinn.

Because there was still something Quinn didn't know and that was where the battle would take place. So far, the Mermerials and Penswi were the two planets that had agreed to join the war, but where would Jim or Jack strike first, once they knew this, then word needed to be sent out to the other planets.

The group agreed they would meet Stark in front of the Dark Reds' building in the evening, this was fine with Quinn because in the meantime there was somewhere else he wanted to go.

'Ceril is in the audience and was with that Amra, I hope the two of them are still together. If they are, it would be great to ask the Amra about how they are doing, or even get coordinates to the planet.

'The Amra were strong and it would be great to convince them to join the fight as well.' Quinn thought.

Outside of the viewing deck used by the Royal family, it was time for the Dark Reds, Quinn, and Russ to say her goodbye to each other.

"You know, when I first saw you Quinn, I really thought, this person is going to be someone that shocks the Penswi race and changes us." Jun said. "The thing was I didn't realise how right I really was, and you shocked us more than once."

Quinn smiled awkwardly as he knew what he meant by this.

"It was a pleasure being with you, thank you for helping us Penswi, thank you for helping me with my wish. We will see each other again, when you need us."

All the others in the Dark Reds said words of encouragement to Quinn as well, but not just him but to Russ, inviting him to come back any time and play a few games.

Then finally, the coach, the older Penswi, walked up to Quinn and looked him in the eye, before saying a few words.

"Usually it would be my duty to get rid of someone like you." The Coach suddenly said. "It seems that you are no longer what you once were. Although, I doubt I could ever beat you in a fight.

"I don't know why you have chosen to save these people, to save my people, but because you have, I will always see you in a good light, and will keep you a secret BB."

The coach left with these words, and turned around, while the Dark Red team members thought the old man was going a bit crazy, but Quinn knew now what the old man was talking about with those final words.

'There is only one group of people that know me by that name. I guess they're not all bad.' Quinn thought.

Leaving the arena, it wasn't hard to find Ceril as she was waiting for them where they had split up. A lot of the Penswi had also gone home as there was an announcement made by the King.

A lot of them were frightened after what happened, and they needed to come up with a good excuse as to not scare them. What surprised Quinn was that Ceril was standing with the Amra.

The two of them seemed to have a bright smile on their faces as they engaged in conversation.

As soon as he saw Quinn and Russ, the Amra ran over immediately.

"Great warrior Quinn!" The Amra said, as he bowed down a few times. "I have just been listening to your friend here, and I didn't realise it before, it is a great pleasure to meet you all the way out here."

"Oh great, another fan!" Russ commented. "Just what has this guy done to get all of this? Did he save another planet or something?"

After a few back and forth introductions went on, Quinn eventually went on to ask about the Amra planet itself. Unfortunately, the Amra hadn't been back in a while. When he last left it was still going well and being led by Geo.

Since that was the case, and with no next destination Quinn thought it was best that he head to the Amra planet. The coordinates and information was given and now the group would have no problem getting there at all.

'I wonder how much has changed on the planet, but I also need to see if they know anything about the Blades as well. Since Logan told me to find the Blades, and Bliss sent me here I thought there was a good chance that they would be on this planet, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The only thing I can do is try and continue to get whatever leads I can.'

It was late evening and the group had headed back to the Dark Reds' building, Stark was ready with an extremely small bag. It seemed like the Penswi liked to travel light. Other than clothes, they didn't really have any more belongings.

"Quinn‚Ä¶ Thank you again for asking me to travel with you. I look forward to learning from you." Stark said.Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

"I do as well, and I have one piece of advice for you, if it ever looks like we are in trouble, just run and get out of there." Quinn said, as they headed back to their ship.

Stark was asking the others a few questions as he wished to know the deeper reason as to why the others were going against their own planet. Russ and Wince tried their best to explain.

While Quinn was setting up the coordinates on the ship, he noticed something‚Ä¶ to get to the Amra planet, they would have to go back past the Mermerial planet anyway.

"Before we head to the next place, let's make a quick stop. I miss my family." Quinn said with the sweetest smile the others had seen him pull‚Ä¶
