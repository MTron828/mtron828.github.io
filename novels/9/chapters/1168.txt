Chapter 1169 Pure“s creation

It was a strange feeling coming over agent 2’s body. He couldn’t quite describe the feeling because he had never felt like this before. His body felt slightly weak, but his Qi was working just as much as it usually would have done.

’Did I not give myself enough time before I fully recovered?’ He thought.

Before arriving, Agent 2 knew that the others would be in the area before they had arrived. It seemed like luck was on their side as they had someone on the inside that was reporting to them what was going on at the Shelter. Because of this, they knew that the beast had already moved.

Time wasn’t on their side, so in order to recover his Qi quickly, Agent 2 did a taboo among those at Pure. However, he had done this more than once before, and his men were aware of the risks. He stole their Qi and added the energy to his.

The only thing was, forcefully removing Qi like so would take someone’s real-life force, but it was the quickest way for them to recover. He was sure that he had recovered back to his top fighting shape, but now he wasn’t so sure, judging by how he was feeling.

The problem was, he didn’t have the pleasure or time of thinking it out. Longblade was already on him, making several slashes, one after the other without allowing for a breath. Agent 2 was able to block them all, but he was unable to find an opening.

’If I can’t put the Qi in my weapon, he’s just as strong as me. What the hell is that sword!’ At the same time, two more arrows came his way, but it seemed like it was easy for him to deal with it this time. He opened the palm of one of his hand, and a strange energy was sent out towards them.

The second the invisible energy hit the arrows, they immediately fell to the ground.

’He can take care of my arrows that easily. I could change into my second form, but I don’t think that would be much help with my shabby sword skills.’

Then there was no choice. She had to go to the third form. She soon found her body transforming as it grew larger, her bottom half changing into a serpent while her top half remained the same. Now, out from her mouth, the first thing she did was spit out a blue flame, placing it on the tip of her arrow. Firing this, she made sure that it stayed behind Longblade.

"Let it hit you!" She shouted.

Hearing this, Longblade allowed for the blue flame to hit his back, and he felt a surge of energy compared to before. Swinging his blade now when it collided against Agent 2, his hand was swung to the side further than before.

’What is this! After being hit by that girl, he suddenly got a post, and what is she right now?’ He thought.

The blue flame had a buff effect, increasing one’s strength by five percent. Now trying to improve their situation, Layla started to fire out arrows hitting all her fellow teammates, giving them the extra energy they needed. On top of this, for those that were injured, she would change to a green flame, giving them a new set of power.

’Things aren’t looking too good. I need to get rid of her! She might prove to be a bigger annoyance than the others!’ Agent 2 started to realise.

Layla was playing the supporting role but wasn’t just supporting Longblade. She was able to support everyone with her arrows, teh telekinesis and strange flames made a good combination. In a way, this was far worse than someone who was strong. Even if Agent 2 won his battle, he would have to continue facing everyone else as well.

On top of that, the strange feeling that was coming over his body wasn’t going away.

"I didn’t think I would have to do this two times in a day. When was the last time I had to go this far? This is pissing me off!" Agent 2 shouted as he dug his weapon into the ground and a force of Qi disappeared outward. Soon energy could be seen forming in front of him, a glowing ball that appeared and went inward. As it did, Agent’s 2 skin started to turn bright red.

A new force was now beaming off him. It was so strong that it nearly knocked Longblade off his feat. That was unless he didn’t have his sword with him. Covering his front, the sword was able to disperse the energy as it went around.

’This power, can I really fight him as it goes on. The sword is a double-edged sword. It even disrupts me when trying to use my soul weapon as long as I’m touching it. I could change to another weapon, but it’s the only advantage I have over him.’

The next second, pointing his weapon towards Longbalde, agent 2 thrust it a few times, and five loud bangs were heard going off one after the other. No one could see anything, and it was only after a few seconds Longblade could feel the pain in his things.

Two large holes had appeared, and two more on his shoulder. If it wasn’t for him holding his weapon upright, it seemed like the fifth would have pierced his head as well.

"Longblade!" Layla shouted as she went to fire Green arrows in an attempt to heal him, but before she could even reach him, Agent 2 already was in between the two of them.

"Now it’s your turn!" Agent 2 said as he fired another shot again. Layla, seeing this, started to shrink her body. He had aimed for the head, hoping to kill her on the spot. With her body changing to the second form, the attack missed and hit the ceiling, making a hole.

Still, there was no worry in agent 2’ eyes as he was ready to fire off more Qi blasts. Until a sudden pain was now felt in his chest. Sweat was now almost pouring from all over his body. He fell down to one knee, and Layla wanted to take advantage of this situation, so she struck him down, hoping to kill him in one blow.

Regardless, a simple wave of Agent 2 weapon hitting hers had sent her flying across the room. Layla had even reinforced her sword with Qi, but it didn’t look like it made a difference.

’What is happening to my body? The pain is getting worse. It’s almost as if it multiplied the second I used the fourth stage.’ Agent 2 thought. Now closing his eyes, he started to meditate, trying to find the source, and he could see it. Something inside him was spreading through his body.

’It’s already spread this far, but I didn’t notice it before, and where did the- ’ in the middle of his thoughts, he had figured it out. It could only be one. After having the fight with the Cursed faction leader, that was when the changes started to occur.

’I can get rid of the energy that’s affecting me, but it’s going to take some time.’ Thinking about this, cancelling the fourth stage was for the best for now. He had already dealt with the strongest of the group here. ’I don’t need that power to fight off this little runt. But I still need to buy some time.’

It was going to take an immense amount of concentration. Still, agent 2 needed to place his hand on his chest, using his Qi to remove the poison in his body, while also fighting one-handed and with a fraction of his powers.

There was a certain worry of how much Layla had improved. He could tell from the initial strike when he had underestimated her through the arrows, so he needed a plan, and he had come up with the perfect one.

"Layla, Layla, Layla." Agent 2 said with a big smile. "I never did like you or your mother, but for you, I feel a little sad. After all, you were someone she never wanted, and every time she looked at you, she would treat you with disgust."

Hearing this, Layla was being filled with anger. She didn’t understand what he was talking about and tried to come charging in again. When the two swords collided this time, there seemed to be an equal power between the two.

"What’s wrong, Layla!" Agent 2 continued to deflect the attacks. His plan of making her the aggressor had worked, all he needed to do was defend and heal himself. "Didn’t your mother ever tell you the truth? I bet you always wondered. Why did she treat me this way? Aren’t I her daughter?

"Tell me, who’s your father Layla? Have you ever met him before? Did she tell you the lie that she would come up with, that he was a fantasy novel writer?"

’Lie’ She thought. What did he mean? Hearing this, she was losing the will to attack. Because she wanted to know the truth, but how could she trust the person that was attempting to kill her. However, who else would know about her father, the father who was a fantasy writer according to her mother.

"I guess I was bang on, you know it was only a rumour, but the story got passed around between the high ranking agents, and one day I saw the reaction of her face as it had been overheard. Now that I see it, it all makes sense. Layla, you were an accident, but not an accident as if you were planned. Oh no, it’s much worse than that, for you see, Agent five always had a deep hatred for ability users because using their powers they had forced her, forced her to have a child. I’m sure you are old enough to know what I mean by this.

"And Imagine being your mother, having to look at you every day, and being reminded of that day. Reminded of why she hated ability users and why she decided to create Pure!" Agent 2 shouted, and at the same time, he had finally pulled out the strange purple energy from himself. Chucking it on the ground, his body could almost feel instant relief.

However, when he looked up at Layla, she stood there still, her arms by her side.

’No, is that the real reason why? The reason she created Pure, was because of...me..how I had come into the world...my father.’

He wasn’t quite sure if he was seeing things, but a dark coloured smog started to surround her, and when she looked up, her eyes were glowing a dark purple.

’What is happening to her?’
