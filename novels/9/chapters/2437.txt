The Champions were called champions for a reason, because they had won many battles over the course of thousands of years. Calva knew a lot about fighting and one of the most important things when heading into a battle, was to believe that there was a way you could beat your opponent. 

When Calva had seen Quinn, he believed that they had a chance, a chance to get rid of Immortui, especially after seeing his strong demon form, and now he was hearing these words, the words of someone who could never win. 

'Was I wrong… was I wrong to put hope into this person, who has given up already.' Calva felt like he had made a mistake, and with it, his life was over. He had rebelled and attempted to attack Immortui, who had made it clear that he was not to attempt to do such a thing or face the consequences. 

He had already attempted once again in the past, resulting in him being chained up. Doing so again, he could only imagine what the punishment would be this time. 

"I can't use my full strength, so inevitably I will lose this fight no matter what." Quinn said. "I have come to accept that, I've had to come to accept that.

"Which is why, I need all of you here to do something important for me."

The last words of a dying man, why should any of them bother doing something like this, and if Quinn died, why would they survive. 

"Firstly, I will head back out there on my own and face Immortui. I will do whatever I can to try to find a way to defeat this power but there's a good chance I won't succeed. Which is why I want you to stay in the shadow space for as long as you can." 

"But, if you go out there, and lose, won't that mean you'll die, what does that mean for the shadow space." Anon asked. 

Quinn had thought about this quite a bit, playing the scenario in his head, while thinking about the conversation he had with Immortui. 

"I said that I would lose the fight, not that I would die." Quinn said, looking toward Calva. "What do you think he would do, if I was to lose the fight."

A realisation had hit Calva. He knew Immortui, knew exactly what he would do, because he had done the same thing to the Champions before. 

"He won't kill you, he'll keep you alive, so he can convince you, and use you in his battle against the celestials." Calva answered. 

Quinn nodded in agreement. 

"That's right. Immortui needs me alive to get out of this place, and on top of that, he wants to use me in his grand fight. I'm pretty confident that he won't kill me, I'm pretty sure… most likely." 

Never before had Quinn had to think this way, where a fight would result not in his death. It was hard to imagine he would be kept alive, which was why he was hesitating with his words slightly.

"This is why I need you guys to stay in the shadow for as long as possible. I have no idea what he plans to do with me, or how he plans to try and convince me to go over to his side, but he can't be around me all the time. 

"I suggest all of you to stay here as long as possible, and when the time is right, to attack the shadow space around you. With your strength, I believe that you guys can break out of the place, and when you do, you will be wherever I am at that moment and time." 

The situation felt tense for them all. They understood the type of risk that was involved. For one, how long would they stay in the shadow space, and when to break out. If they chose a wrong time, then they could just be facing Immortui all over again, not making their current situation any better. 

"Then what?" Calva said. "We get to escape with our lives to be chased by Immortui and his demon kings. All we are doing is hiding!"

"No." Quinn said. "I'm trusting you the most." His finger was pointed right at Calva. 

"These three, they told me stories about how strong you were, about the strength you had to fight against Immortui. So much so that they were sure if the two of us worked together we could take him down, I'm just sorry I'm not at my best right now.

"You saw what happened to me and my demon form. At the moment I'm unable to control it, but I feel that there is a chance that I can. 

"My race, my kind, my power is all dependent on blood. When I consumed the demon king's blood, not only did I get a boost in power, but I was also able to control a part of myself. 

"There are five great demon kings under Immortui's command, correct?" 

Quinn asked this question, knowing there were other demon races that Immortui had created but the system was specific in his request, so he needed to make this part of the quest clear. 

"I need the blood of the five demon kings, and five demon generals that are under Immortui command, the strongest in his army. With that, my demon form will be stronger and I'll be able to control myself."

Now Calva understood why Quinn was talking to him and not the others, to get the blood of the demon kings. It practically meant fighting against all of them, going against them and that just wasn't possible for anyone but the champions. 

"I made the stupid decision to come here on my own in the end." Quinn said. Memories in his head went through of those that were close to him. Those that were extremely powerful. 

Not wanting to get them involved, had perhaps cost him, and in turn if he failed, it meant that they would all suffer.

"Because of that I have to put my trust in all of you." Quinn stood up and started to walk away from the others in the black space. "Save the other champions, rally up the inhabitants and get that blood."

"You make it sound easy." Calva smirked. "Even if we get the blood, then we have to somehow get to you as well."

Seeing Calva smile, and ask these questions, it gave Quinn confidence. 

"I'll take your questions as a fact that you're willing to take on the challenge. The Skullys were right about the two of us working together, I guess they just never thought it would quite be this way.

"Get me that blood, If you do, I will do everything in my power to defeat Immortui." 

Quinn's body started to sink into the shadow in the ground and his body was gone, he was back on the battlefield ready to face Immortui once more. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
