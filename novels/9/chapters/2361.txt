Since the vampire settlement was low on numbers compared to before and wished to protect itself from any attacks that may occur at any time. Most of the leaders continued to stay and were unable to head out.

In the first place, the groups were heading out to find their allies and inform them of what was happening, so there wasn't an expectation that there would be a fight, of sorts.

Small groups of vampires led by vampire knights and nobles had gone far and wide, because there was a need to be.

One of the groups had been sent out to search for Ray, and they had no idea of his location. What they had decided to do was head to the planet where JIm and Jack Eno were last seen, the planet where the Marco Cruise ships had been created.

It took a few days for them to reach, but the small fleet of ships had finally landed at the specially made facility and it wasn't like anything they had expected.

Walking in front of the squad was a male vampire named Stockton, one of the vampire knights, and behind him was his small squad of around ten other vampires.

They were looking around to the left and right in disbelief at everything.

"What did you think happened here, sir?" One of the vampires asked.

"Can't you see with your own eyes. We are both looking at the same thing aren't we? It's clear that there was a massacre here."

The whole facility was smashed complete to pieces, it looked almost like an asteroid had hit the planet based on the way pieces had been destroyed. There was nothing for them to really see, but a few traces of blood here and there.

"Based on what we know, it's clear that Ray has been here." Stockton said. "It looks like he is doing as he said, getting rid of all the facilities that Jim had created, making sure that there is no way for him to come back."

They only had one choice, to send a report saying they had yet to locate Ray. The main issue being that they had no more leads to go from here and with everything destroyed, where would they go next to find him, where was he and what was he even doing right now?

‚Äî‚Äî-

One of the squads that had been sent by the vampires, had arrived on Earth. As for the one they were looking for, it was none other than Sil. In the past he had left earth in search of a way of dealing with whatever it was that would come their way.

When doing research though, they had found through the reports that Sil had actually last been seen on earth, having not left the planet. Still Earth was large, there were many cities and places to go to, but there was one that they could get in contact with that had an idea of where he would be, and that was Shiro.

"Are we sure this is the right place, Ma'am?" One of the vampires asked the knight.

"I'm sure of it." Emmerdale replied. "This is the right place, I checked and checked again."

The group hopped over the gate and had reached what looked like a playground. There were drawings on the floor, climbing frames, slides, swings and more, and in front of them there was a single large building.

On top of the building there was a sign that read 'Black Rock Orphanage.'

It made all of the vampires there think, why would one that was as powerful as Sil be here. He had the power to rule worlds, to be at the very top, and would easily be able to acquire some type of following and become an influential figure.

He could even build up the Blades again to what it was before and in doing good deeds or working as mercenaries. It would improve their image. In fact, another option, just like the vampires did, was to decide to put an end to his life, yet he had decided to live and ended up in a place like this.

The group continued to walk forward and before they had even reached the door to the large building, several men and women had surrounded them. It was almost as if they had appeared out for nowhere.

They appeared in a circle, pointing their weapons toward the centre directly at the group. One of the vampires was quick to act but Emmerdale stopped him, by grabbing his wrist before he acted.

"Remember, we're not in enemy territory, and if you really think you can go and take out a person holding a demon tier weapon like that, then be my guest." She said."

"Demon tier weapon?"

The other vampires could soon see the same thing Emmerdale did, as they looked at the weapons in the hands of each of their attackers, all of them were Demon tier weapons.

'Why would there be such guards in a palace like this, with such strong weapons just for an orphanage, is this really just an ordinary orphanage.' I think you should take a look at

"We are sorry to come unannounced but it was an emergency." Emmerdale stated. "Shiro Blade was the one that gave us the information about this place. We are here searching for Sil Blade. We have been sent by Muka, and on behalf of the vampire settlement."

The others continued to raise their weapons and Emmerdale was wondering if they were about to have a fight on their hands.

"The vampire settlement?" One of the men asked, holding onto a demon tier sword. "If it's to do with the settlement, then Quinn should be enough. There is no need for Sil to get involved."

"This matter in question." Emmerdale glanced away for a second. "It has to do with Quinn Talen."

Hearing that name, it seemed that all of the others reacted. In doing so just as fast as they came, all of them disappeared seemingly teleporting away from the place, apart from the man that was holding the sword directly in front of the door.

"Follow me, it will be best if we speak inside."

They followed the man inside the large building and straight away they could hear noises, it was children. As they walked through the halls and large rooms they could see children doing activities along with other adults.

They were of various ages from 5 to 16, and they all seemed to get along. On top of that, all of the facilities inside the building were state of the art. It was clearly a high end orphanage that had a lot of money put into it.

Heading to the top floor, they had come across an office, and when the doors opened there was no one inside. They were expecting to see Sil, but he was nowhere to be seen.

"Where is Sil?" Emmerdale asked.

Continuing to walk, the man went to the desk and sat in his seat when he did, his face changed and it was the one they were looking for, Sil.

"You were with us all along! Or are you someone else?" Another vampire asked.

"Yes, I was with you all along, in fact I am the only one here." Sil said. "All of the staff, the guards from earlier that attacked you, they are all just me, disguised. I don't want the children to get freaked out."

Sil, having helped out in the great battle, had decided to eventually take over an orphanage. He had listened to the advice given to him well, that maybe he was part of the trouble that was out there.

So he thought it was best for him to wait, if the time came that someone would attack earth then he would help protect it. In the meantime he wanted to do something good.

All of the Blades on Blade island were raised as if they were orphans, so he decided that he wanted to give those children that grew up with next to no parents a good life.

When doing his research that was when he had stumbled across an orphanage called Black Rock Orphanage that had been going on for years, it had a great long legacy, and he decided that he wanted to protect it, protect what legacy had been going on for a long time, and continue to do good for this person who had started all of this.

"I see." Emmerdale said. "I am sorry to disturb your peace, but we have an urgent message to deliver‚Ä¶ Quinn needs your help."

"You don't need to say anymore." Sil said, standing up. "I will help."

Peter, Edvard, Hikel and Sil, so far, were on board but there was still the task of getting three more.
