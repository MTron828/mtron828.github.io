Chapter 821 The second castle

Once the little spat between the two girls was over, Peter decided to sit there silently. Honestly, he didn’t think he had the energy to scream, the pain from his severed arm was disappearing and he was wondering if it was because he was getting closer to death.

’Wait, aren’t I undead anyway? I guess I’ll just become an unmoving corpse then.’

Finally, the Second vampire leader Cindy started to walk over to the two of them.

"Now lets see what we have over here." Cindy said, she walked past Peter and was taking a look at Layla first. She just looked around her body noticing that there were no marks or scars, and even the wound on her stomach had healed up but there was a scar left over it.

"Strange, she seems fine, and her wounds have healed to a certain point but now it looks like they have stopped, and she’s showing no sign of waking up." Cindy said speaking to herself, well aware that Peter was in the room. Still looking at Layla on the bed, she moved her fringe to the side revealing the two small bumps on her head.

"A Hannaya, so rare." She said with her eyes glowing. "It’s a shame that someone so special like you fell into the hands of the Tenth."

She continued to look at Layla for a while now, not doing much other than inspecting the horns on her forehead and eventually this had frustrated Peter to the point where he needed to say something.

"Hey lady, not to say my friend doesn’t need help or anything, but I think I’m the one that’s dying." Peter said, his face covered in sweat. "Maybe I’m the one you should look at first?"

Moving from the side of the bed, Cindy walked over to where Peter was.

"Finally, I can get my ar-"

Trying to finish his sentence, it was interrupted as he felt something hard go against his mouth, busting his lip and jolting his head. Soon his whole body was following along as he went crashing and tumbling into the beds.

"I know you are new to all of this, but there is a certain level of respect that needs to be met when speaking to a leader. We spent years rising to this position and to finally get it, I will not be spoken down to by an undead like yourself. You are lucky I am even bothering to treat you."

Turning around, she didn’t bother to check on Peter’s condition. She couldn’t care less if he died, she would simply say he didn’t arrive in time and blame it on Kazz for delaying them. Instead she went back to Layla.

Thankfully, Peter was still alive as she had only slapped him. Lying on the floor with parts of one of the beds on top of him, he tried to get up but simply had no energy. Attempting to lift up his head, he quickly failed and passed out.

Opening her eyes slowly, Layla was greeted with a ceiling filled with strange markings she didn’t recognise. It was covered in engravings that looked like they belonged to a century she had only seen in history books.

’Where am I?’ She thought, as the last thing she could remember was activating her skill trying to save her mothers life. Beyond that she had no clue what had happened after.

Turning to her side, she could see Peter there in his bed, with his arm attached and bandaged up, she was happy there was at least one familiar person with her in the room.

"You’re finally awake." Peter said. "Good thing that woman isn’t here, I imagine she would be jumping all over you right now."

Looking underneath her sheets, Layla realised that her clothes had changed from what she last remembered wearing, and now she was wearing casual gothic clothing that the vampires often wore, and her bow was nowhere to be seen either.

"Did she change me while I was asleep?" She said with her face bright red.

"Relax, I didn’t see anything." Peter replied. "It probably happened while I was passed out. Your uniform was ripped anyway."

"Oh, right..." Layla said slowly, as she started to remember everything that happened. "What happened after I, I mean, how am I still alive?"

Peter was thinking about what to say, he knew the tough question was coming and even though he just wanted to blurt it out and get it over with, if there was one person who should have told her in person about what had happened, it should have been Quinn.

"Kazz brought the two of us here, apparently Pure knows how to use some special Qi that stops vampires from regenerating, so the suggestion was made to bring us here. The strange lady should be back soon, she was the one that healed us. I don’t know if it’s a healing ability, but it wouldn’t make sense if it was. None of the other healing abilities were working so it must not be a healing ability. Still, she got my arm working like before, but I still don’t like the bi*tch." Peter said as he touched his face where she had slapped him, even though there was no sign of injury.

Just as Peter was going to explain what Cindy had done, the doors swung open and she entered the room. When she saw that Layla was awake, she quickly walked over to her side.

"Oh great, how are you feeling? There are no problems are there?" She said as she grabbed both of Layla’s hands and had the biggest smile on her face.

"No I feel fine, great." Layla replied.

"Excellent, I know you two are part of the Tenth family, but I want you to treat this place like it’s your own. I am Cindy Cha, leader of the Second family. I have instructed those in the castle to treat you like you are one of us."

Peter didn’t like the way Cindy was treating Layla compared to him, she was acting as if the incident between the two of them never happened. Still, Peter had learnt to keep his mouth shut. He knew he didn’t stand a chance against her, and eventually she would leave like she had been doing so far.

After introductions were done, and Cindy gave Layla a warm welcome, they were free to relax and roam around the castle using the spare rooms located in the throne room as they had been doing. In fact, Cindy insisted that they used these rooms. She would then inform them on what to do next when she had been given orders.

Peter had eventually told Layla what had happened between the two of them, and why he had such a disliking towards her.

"Duh, of course she would get mad." Layla said. "Didn’t you hear what she said, you disrespected her. The vampires have different ways of acting when talking. You need to think of the leaders more like kings here and you had just offended the king while in her castle."

When Layla had put it that way, Peter understood the reaction a bit more, but still there was something that he didn’t like about her. While relaxing in the room, Cindy had left as she usually did.

Peter stood up and pressed his ear up against the wall to try and figure out which direction she was walking in.

"What are you doing Peter?" Layla asked. "We have been treated so nicely here and you’re going to snoop around?"

"I just need to find out what is going on, don’t worry, even if I get caught I won’t get in trouble." Said Peter.

"What do you mean?"

Peter then knocked on the door, and the servants that were at their call opened up the door.

"We’re a bit hungry, do you mind getting the two of us some food?" Peter asked.

No questions asked, the servants agreed and started to head towards the kitchen. There were no guards protecting them. There were guards and vampires all over the castle, but Layla and Peter weren’t considered a threat in the first place. They were guests after all.

As soon as Peter saw the servant leave, he used his transformation skill turning into the servant and had quickly left the room following in the direction that Cindy had gone.

"I forgot he had that transformation ability." Layla said as she laid back down in her bed, not worrying about him too much. "Wait, the smell, that idiot!"
