Chapter 921 - Borden's grudge

Seeing how everyone fighting in the plaza square was at least holding their ground for now, Quinn had decided to use the shadow void skill to create a dome around himself. It wasn’t particularly large because it didn’t need to be, but the first thing he wanted to do was regain his shadow MC points.

On the platform, the small little dome had been created and he remained inside. Quinn could have also used the shadow lock on himself. Taking him completely out of the fight, however in this space he was unable to regain his MC points as fast, and right now, time was a very important factor. At the same time sitting in the dome, Quinn started to meditate and he could feel his Qi energy coming back once again.

’Just wait Cindy, the second I’m out of here, I’ll pay you back for all that crap that you put me through.’ Quinn thought. ’Guys, just wait a little longer.’

It was almost impossible for him not to worry, while the rest were outside fighting.

Outside, the shadow dome was noticed by Cindy as well.

’That boy, he is someone I have to watch out for. He is a dark horse that could ruin everything, and with that shadow power of his it is a problem, especially if he calls him’ Cindy thought referring to Arthur.

Seeing this, Jill looked towards Remus, and gave him a slight nod, and soon he placed his fingers up towards his head and twisted them slightly.

Those that had come from the tenth family were busy fighting members of the eighth family once again, only this time, they didn’t seem to be as alive as before. Their eyes looked slightly dull. It was clear that something was up, especially their mumbled words.

However, in the middle of their fight, something strange had happened. They soon were ignoring those in front of them, and instead were trying to run past and head to the stage. That’s when Sam spotted others coming from behind the plaza, and out from the sides. All the vampires were heading towards the stage.

"They’re aiming for Quinn!" Sam shouted. "If his shadow gets attacked then it will lower his MC points and he won’t have time to recover. We have to protect him."

Everyone had heard Sam’s words, and were quick to act as they rushed over to Quinn’s side, but they wouldn’t reach him before the others did, and all the other leaders seemed to be occupied with their own fights.

Those from the eighth family that came from the other areas were seen climbing the stage, and Bryce and Prima had just let them past, without attacking a single one.

’I told you to stay out of this, we don’t need your help.’ Bryce thought.

As one of the vampires finally got up on the stage, he didn’t have far to reach Quinn, but soon he felt something wrap around his feet, and he was thrown back down to the ground. Another vampire had climbed on the other side, and a stomp on its fingers forced the vampire to let go.

Standing on the stage were two girl’s Silver and Kazz, and they wouldn’t let any of the vampires get on stage.

Nate placed both his fingers in his mouth and started to whistle out.

"Look at that, we the tenth family have the baddest girls protecting our leader!" Nate said excitedly.

"Aren’t they from a different family?" Linda tried to correct him.

But he ignored the comment and continued to cheer them on.

Now, on the ground floor, all those in the tenth family were also protecting the bottom area of the stage. They struck with their weapons, and used their shadow abilities to cover each other’s backs.

Erin, in particular, was impressive as she was getting stronger each time she dealt with one of the vampires, but would alternate between attacking and helping the others, as the words of Leo went through her mind.

Layla, on the other hand, wasn’t doing too well. She hadn’t transformed into any of her other forms and was just firing out arrows, but finding it hard to not interfere with those fighting. It seemed like she was holding back her power, or she just had something else on her mind.

However, it didn’t seem to matter. Although those from the tenth family were few and outnumbered, they were far more impressive than a bunch of regular vampires. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"It looks like the one that is controlling those from the eighth family is the one they call the original vampire." Leo commented. "Borden, if we want to stop the others from getting hurt, it would be in our best interest to get rid of him as fast as possible."

"Don’t worry." Borden said, setting off kicking the ground with his feet. His powerful legs pushed off the ground beneath, and the floor was chucked up. "I’m already on it."

Just like before it looked like Remus was able to recover from Borden’s powerful hits, but this time, Borden didn’t want to give him the time to use his powerful abilities, so he decided to take the fight to a close combat level.

At first Remus seemed to be struggling, he was getting hit, and finding it hard to regenerate on the fly. With each punch delivered by Borden, it would destroy all the bones in that part of Remus’s body. The others seeing this were wondering if this was something all original vampires could do, or if it was just special to Remus.

However, soon Remus was getting used to Borden’s speed, and he was able to tap the fist slightly to throw them off edge so the attacks would miss. The momentum of Borden’s punches were strong. So as long as Remus could hit his fist away at the right time, he could make it so Borden would carry on going forward and punch nothing but the air, at the same time his body was thrown off balance and Remus kneed Borden in the stomach hitting him away.

"Remember there are two of us this time!" Leo shouted, swinging his sword vertically. If Remus didn’t do anything he would be sliced halfway through his midpoint, and even he wasn’t sure he would be able to recover, especially with the bald man’s strange abilities.

Using the blood hardening, he tried to block it as much as he could but the blade was still piercing through his waist. He had no choice, but to use his hands to activate the blood canon ability. Firing them off towards Leo, he was hoping to take him out of the fight.

Loud bangs were heard as the two cannons successfully had hit, but it hadn’t hit Leo, instead it was Borden. His hard scales were falling from his body, and green blood had been split, but he didn’t have the face of someone who had just been hurt. His face was full of smiles.

"Do you not remember, the more you hurt me!" Borden shouted, grabbing both of Remus’ hands while they were in the middle of healing from the blood cannon. "The stronger I get it."

Using his great strength, which far outmatched that of Remus, Borden was able to rip both of his arms from his body, and then without wasting time, he swung his own limbs at him, hitting him in the head. They exploded as they hit his body.

It was a grose site to see, as part of the arm was flung all over the place and blood was swinging everywhere.

"Let’s see how much you can heal if I keep tearing off your body parts like this. It has to end at some point, right?"

Now with his arms in the middle of healing again, Remus didn’t have much to attack either and could see the swordsman was coming at him again.

’This is really troublesome, I have to do something.’ Remus thought as he looked towards Borden.

Then a few seconds later, as Leo was swinging his sword down ready to cut Remus’s head in half, he felt a punch in his stomach hitting him away, sending him across the floor. Luckily, Leo was being cautious and had the second stage of Qi covering his whole body, but it didn’t completely help him negate the damage.

Looking up at who had just done such a thing, he could see that the one that had hit him, was none other than Borden.

"Why are you attacking me?" Leo asked.

"Why, because you’re the one trying to hurt the people I care about." Borden replied.

Leo quickly realised that whatever was affecting those in the eighth family, was now affecting Borden, and he was seeing Leo as his enemy.
