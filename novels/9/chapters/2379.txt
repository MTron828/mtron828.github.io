The area around the champion was lighting up as the magic circles shined brightly on the ground. A surge of power was flowing into the circles from the air itself. This was a bit different from the magic circles that Quinn had dealt with before.

'I thought since coming in here, that the air was different compared to everywhere else.' Quinn thought. 'It seems like the air itself has a strong energy source and it's powering the magic circles. There is no need for beast crystals.'

What Quinn needed to worry about more was what was about to come out of the magic circles themselves. There were those around the pillar and around the champion, it was clear that they were meant to restrain the champion.

However, there was now a large one in front of him and something seemed to be coming through.

Jumping back, the clone escaped the area of the circle, and while doing so started to gather aura in both of its hands.

'With the clone, I can't use the Blood forest punch to absorb its blood. It would have been nice to see what it could have given me. Since the demon generals can evolve my blood power, a demon king would most likely prompt another quest of some sort.

'But, if this thing really is strong, then it would be best for me to kill it before it was summoned, or at least damage it.'

Quinn didn't want to kill it in one attack, because he wanted to absorb its blood, so although he was putting a lot of strength into this attack, he was hoping that it wouldn't finish it off.

[Blood cannon blast]

Just like the blood cannon attack, essentially Quinn was doing the same thing, but with both of his hands, adding the skills that he only had, such as Qi, the strength of his punch and the speed of his hands. He hit the air, and a shockwave of power exploded around, pushing the red aura for a moment.

A strong powerful red pulse went out toward the magic circle. Rather than creating a sword or a spear, this was a pure form of energy meant to just create as much damage as possible.

The champion that was tied up was watching everything very carefully.

"Oh, it looks like this person might have had some sense climbing those stairs, no wonder he had no fear coming up here, he has some skills to back it up‚Ä¶ but that won't be enough.'

Out from the top of the magic circle, a large singular red crystal could be seen poking through, rising up. The blood blast had hit the top of the crystal, it continued to clash against it, but the figure continued to emerge from the magic circle.

It was doing nothing to damage what was coming out. One crystal soon had become many, and eventually Quinn's blood blast had come to an end, as it did no damage, there was no need for him to waste his energy continuing his attack.

The figure had already been summoned.

'So this is the demon king, the one that those guys said had power close to Immortui.' The clone thought, and assumed that their guess was somewhat right, since it was the first time an attack from the clone hadn't even left a scratch on the demon's body.

"It's been a long time since I was summoned here, and of all times while I just got a report of a problem happening at the hunting grounds, just what is going on?" The demon king said.

It was hard to tell exactly what he was saying as the words were spoken through sharp jagged rock-like teeth that seemed to be made of the same type of red crystal the other demons had.

From just the look of things, it was quite clear that the demon in front of them was of the Durum race, but the demon king looked quite different compared to all the others. First of all, the amount of red crystal that was hardened over all of its body.

Although there was a human shape, it was hard to even see any human parts, or anything that resembled skin, as the legs, arms, and torso were completely made out of the red crystal, even the teeth. It was only part of the face near that of the eyes that had a little bit of skin.

Then there was its large back, it was even larger than the demon general, and truly looked like there was a shell of some sort on its body. It made the sheer size of the demon look around two times bigger, even though it was only a little bigger than its counterparts, but smaller than the champion behind it.I think you should take a look at

Regardless, Quinn could sense the flowing energy coming out of its body, it was clear that this demon was incredibly strong. The magic circle underneath the demon king's feet had disappeared, now that his body had been fully summoned and he looked upon Quinn who was in front of him.

"That attack, that is not something that the inhabitants can do. The energy you are using, it feels familiar, yet different at the same time." The demon king said.

His confused look turned into a smile, as he had figured out why the attack felt somewhat similar.

"I thought as much, there are no longer any inhabitants that are strong enough, nor have the will to take us on. You are one of us, you are a demon created from Immortui's power!"ùíÇll new stùíêries at n0ve/lbi/ùíè(.)cùíêm

The champion raised his head, he had a feeling that this was the case as well, when he first saw Quinn and now it had been confirmed.

"You must be one of his new creations. This seems to happen every single time. I haven't seen you before, but it's the same pattern we have all been through. We get a rise in strength, we are able to topple the other races and the natural inhabitants, and then we go after the demon kings to try to prove ourselves before taking on Immortui himself."

Quinn knew that there were other demon races, mainly because of the quest he had received, where it stated he only needed to gather the blood of the five great races.

"If you wished to battle, then there was no need for you to come here, I, Kronker, am happy to accept a battle at any point any time. If you had just asked then perhaps I would have gone easy on you, but the fact that you have forcefully summoned me here, has put me in a bad mood." Kronker, the demon king, said as he bashed his two crystal hands together.

The red crystal started to light up, and the swirling power in the air started to swirl around both of his hands. Dark red clouds started to form above the area they were in. Since they were so high up in the sky as well, there were even a few clouds that had darkened in the area they were in.

'The red mist, the air, is moving towards the demon king as well. Are they able to draw from the natural power from this world as well? This is something I can't do‚Ä¶ this might be harder than I thought, especially if this is something Immortui is able to do.' Quinn thought.

Stretching out his arms, they both extended, forming two large sharp crystal blades.

"I am Kronker, one of the five great demon kings of this world, a being that was created and raised to defeat the gods. You will now learn why no one has been able to best me for 1000's of years!"

The clone of Quinn, stretched out both of his arms, gathering his own blood aura, they were swirling around his gauntlets, like a dragon, the palm of his hands were starting pulsate like a heartbeat with power, while the shadow covering his back started to mix in with the blood aura, turning the waves into a darker red, almost purple-like, colour.

Quinn was using the shadow blood from the get go, the skill that allowed him to defeat the god slayer Asura.

'If I can't defeat one of the demon kings with half my strength, then I won't be able to take down Immortui!' the clone thought, as it charged forward.
