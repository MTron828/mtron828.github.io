Chapter 414 Special boy

"First before we proceed any further, it‚Äôs important I tell you all a bit about myself." The instructor shouted in a loud booming voice. "This is so you guys know you are getting the appropriate training and you can decide for yourself whether or not I am someone worth listening to. I am Clark Talon, Vampire knight of the fourth family, the Talons. As you know, every year it is the duty of one of the families to send a vampire knight out to train the descendants and this year it is the fourth family‚Äôs turn, and I have chosen for these two months to focus on familiar training."

Raising his arm straight out to his right he kept it straight, and slowly his fingertips started to turn black, and a mist started to form until eventually, what could only be described as a demonic-looking raven appeared on the top of his hand. "This here is my familiar. Although I am no longer a descendent in line to become a leader due to becoming a vampire knight, I once was just like all of you. I have quite the experience when it comes to things like this."

Snapping his finger, the Raven completely disappeared in a second. It was clear he had complete control over it. Something that Quinn wanted as well. He didn‚Äôt even know how to summon his familiar, that would be the first step before even thinking about controlling it.

The instructor Clark then pulled out a square black mat that was one square meter in size, and appeared to have a strange circle drawn on it in red. The circle had even more circles drawn inside overlapping each other and strange patterns going throughout.

"A summoning circle." The system said. Although Quinn wanted to ask the system some questions, he couldn‚Äôt right now as he was too focused on what the instructor was saying.

"For those who have not successfully been able to capture, or perhaps just weren‚Äôt able to subdue a familiar, we will be trying to form a contract using this, a summoning circle. When using this it will allow the bridge between our world and the familiar world to form a connection. Everything has already been prepared beforehand and a single drop of blood from the one wanting to perform the summon is all you need. Once that is inserted, we will then start the contract bonding process."

One of the female students then raised her hand as she heard of this.

"But Sir, if we could have received our familiars this way, then why did we need to go out for the last week or so hunting looking for one ourselves? Isn‚Äôt this a lot easier?" She asked.

"Thank you for asking the question and I will explain." Clark said. "You see, when dropping your blood, it will show your desires and wants, sending them through to the other world. Those interested will come rushing forward at once, and the first one to arrive will form a contract. Unfortunately, the vampire has no choice.

"The familiars that are out here and have been in our world have had time to adapt, they understand human ways more and are more likely to be powerful. There is also the chance to choose which familiar you want based on your own skills. Besides, the stronger familiars would like to know more about you than just your blood. Sometimes familiars have other factors that they are looking for, we still do not understand everything about them. If I‚Äôm honest, it is unlikely when summoning a familiar this way, that a strong one will appear. It is more likely that it will attract the desperate ones that wish to leave that place."

Hearing these words, the five on the stage looked a little depressed but chose not to say anything. In truth, if they were to cause a fuss then Clark would have explained further but didn‚Äôt wish to embarrass them in front of everyone if he didn‚Äôt need to. The truth was, if they had been out looking for a familiar on the outside for a week and weren‚Äôt able to find one, then more so than not, none of them were interested in them in the first place.

A familiar was able to sense those that it might be well in tuned with and will actively go out to seek one. With the explanation all done, it was time for the process to begin. The students formed a line, and a blade was used to cause a small cut on their finger, dripping it into the centre of the magic circle.

The circle started to light up bright red, and while this process was happening, the student would continue to mumble. "Please be a strong one, please be a strong one."

Then when the light had ended, all the students could see what had appeared. In front of him, his familiar had appeared. It was pink in color and was as large as a snake, wiggling about on the floor, but strangely it had no facial features, no eyes, no tongue. Just a pink thing wriggling about on the floor.

"Hey is that a worm?" Rokene said quite loudly. It caused some of the other students to chuckle a little, as it really did just look like a giant worm.

"A familiar is not everything, even if one is as pathetic or weak like this, you can still focus on your own skills." Clark said. "Remember, there are plenty of vampires that make it to a higher level even without a familiar."

The next set of students had arrived doing the same thing one after another, and several other familiars were seen. Not all of them looked incredibly weak like the first. There was a wolf for one, a strange butterfly looking for another, and a few more. Whatever the case was, they all knew they were now stuck with these as their familiars and they could choose to use it or not.

With the weaker familiars, it would be harder for them to disobey in the first place. They were just happy they were out on the outside and were unlikely to go against their master and try to kill them.

Everyone went back in line and had lined up once again. Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

"Okay, so now I wish to see all your familiars in its closed form. What I mean by this is the form it takes before it is summoned. I will be going around asking you what familiar you each have while looking at the closed form."

Going around one by one, Clark would look at their closed forms, then if they could, he would ask them to try to summon it right in front of him. He reassured everyone that it wouldn‚Äôt matter if they couldn‚Äôt summon it for now. It was just that usually from the closed form alone, he would have an idea what type of familiar it was.

But even he hadn‚Äôt seen every familiar in existence, so this way, he would be able to broaden his knowledge, trying to remember their closed forms that matched with their appearance.

Quinn noticed that actually most of the students were unable to summon their familiar so far, with a few exceptions. Then it came to Rokene‚Äôs turn. Summoning the black rabbit was an easy task for him, and he had a smug look on his face as he lifted his nose up high for everyone to see.

"Very good Rokene, as expected, and the familiar seems to like you well."

Finally, standing by his side, it was Quinn‚Äôs turn. The strange looks the two had given each other didn‚Äôt go unnoticed by both of them, and now it felt a little awkward as the two had come face to face.

"Please." Clark said.

Looking around, Quinn noticed there was a girl in the row behind him, as well as one to his side, but he had no choice. His marking was on his back, just underneath where his shoulder blades would lie. The only way he could show it was by lifting up his shirt and turning around, and that‚Äôs what he did.

Closing his eyes out of embarrassment, Quinn was unable to see the reaction of the two girls next to him, but as they saw his perfectly crafted abs as if it was a sculpture, they started to feel themselves heat up a bit. It wasn‚Äôt normal for a vampire to have such a toned body, especially one around Quinn‚Äôs age, and all the girls couldn‚Äôt help but try to take a peek, getting excited as they imagined running their fingers down his stomach feeling each abb.

However, the one that was most shocked out of everyone wasn‚Äôt the girls, but was instructor Clark himself. Looking at the strange circle he knew what it was straightaway. Perhaps the youngsters around didn‚Äôt know because it was past their time, but he did.

"Do you know what this is, and can you summon it?"

"No." Quinn replied, "But I know it‚Äôs a Boneclaw."

Putting his shirt back down, the others started to whisper to themselves, trying to see if any of them had heard of it before, but it seemed like they hadn‚Äôt.

Of course, the old king‚Äôs familiar was kept secret. Just like how one ability would give one an advantage if known, it was the same for the familiars, and only those at the very top would know.

"You are a special boy." Clark said as he moved onto the next student.
