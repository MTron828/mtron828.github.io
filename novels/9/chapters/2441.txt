Energize and Prepare
0.00 / 0.00

The group practically moped around Quinn doing nothing for a while. It felt like they were just hoping for him to get up, or wake up. Never did they imagine after going through so much, being so prepared, they would be placed in a situation like this. 

Frustrated, Peter even resorted to some measures of his own to try and get Quinn to wake up. For one, he peeled his eyelids back, surprisingly they were glowing red and not just the iris, the whole eyeball was red in colour, glowing with power. 

It was somewhat proof that something was happening to Quinn at this moment, they just had no idea what. A slap on the face, a heavy shake, and even some name calling. These were all things that Peter, in the past as a subclass directly under Quinn, couldn't do, but after Quinn had become a celestial they were all fine, but more importantly, none of them worked and they were still stuck in the same situation as they were before. 

"We can't just sit around and do nothing." Hikel said. "We need to find a way to try and help Quinn. Maybe someone amongst these planets would know. Perhaps one of the local inhabitants, like those Chrono, knows something. 

"They must have faced and come across something like this when facing the demons and Immortui before, someone must know."

The logic Hikel used was quite sound. The major issue was more so who was in control of those inhabitants in the first place. There always seemed to be demons lingering around them wherever they went. 

"The Chrono." Chris said. "They were being forced by that demon king to participate in those games. If we go to them, we need to fight the demon king again, and with our strength, I don't think we would win. 

"Heading out there, it's a big risk getting caught by the demon kings or even Immortui" 

"What!" Russ said. "Is the big bad wolf, legs shaking after a bigger wolf kicked him a few times. If we can't even go against those demon king guys then there's no point of us even being here." 

"Hey!" Edvard snapped. "We saved Quinn by coming here, he's with us isn't he." 

"Yeah, as a vegetable." Russ said. "Go on, let's see him fight for us. Why don't we just go out there and start swinging his body, maybe vampire blood will shoot out of his eyes and arse, you stupid fools!"

The tension was high between the group. These things tend to happen when they were frustrated. Especially since they all felt like there was nothing they could do. Although Russ seemed the least affected, the fact that he hadn't left the place showed that even he had some fear of the outside world. 

"First, let's explore the area around us." Hikel said, interrupting them all. "We can check if there are any locals around, but before interacting with any of them, we need to see what the situation is. 

"We don't want to be getting caught out by any demons. We have to assume that everyone here knows about us now, and if the demons know the demon kings will know, the message will be passed down and it won't be long until we all end up like Quinn."

Hikel looked at everyone in the room until he had made a decision. 

"Edvard and Chris you two head out, we don't need everyone to go, but just be careful. I'm trusting you two." 

Hikel didn't say it out loud, but if he sent Peter or Russ he could only guess the two of them would cause trouble. They needed Sil to stay next to Quinn in case anyone arrived, and although Hikel would have loved to have gone himself, he needed to stay to stop arguments from happening between Russ and Peter, who seemed alright so far but only time would tell. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Agreeing to the task, both Edvard and Chris walked to the edge of the cave, they were on a cliff side so they were able to stare out. With their hands blocking the sun, they stared off into the distance. 

"This planet, it's quite amazing, everything is huge in size and the plants, they're so colourful and mixed with colours." Edvard said. "I've never seen a place like this." 

Chris then pointed to a particular direction where smoke could be seen from afar. Several large wood-like structures could be seen as well. It almost looked like a type of factory but if they could see it from this far, then the items that they were seeing had to be huge. 

"I think if we head there we are bound to find something." Chris gathered.

Nodding in agreement, the two jumped off, and were light while being quick on their feet. 

Running through the large forest, the two kept seeing beautiful plants, mixed in with ponds of water. Nearly everything they passed looked as if it had been painted from someone's dreams. The flowers, the colours that surrounded them, they were all spectcaular, fading from one to the other. 

Seeing all of this just made all of them more curious about what they were going to find and as they got closer, they could hear conversing as well as several banging noises going off one after the other, just as if one was inside the middle of a factory. 

The two quickly found a large tree, with a trunk, still around a mile or so away from the object they had seen and scaled up high. When they eventually reached a height where they could see out, both Chris and Edvard used their strong fingertips to dig into the tree and hold onto the side. 

Now they could see, there were several people working on the large object in front of them, and there were several large objects. They were mining large metal rocks, shaping them, and mixing them with a number of crystals, melting them down and such. 

It was clear they were making something, but they had no idea what, since it was nothing they could recognise. What they could clearly see were the 'people' working on it. 

"Do you think they're demons?" Edvard asked. 

They were all giant in size, and had large tusk like teeth that bent upwards. They were the Yak demon race. 

Chris had ignored Edvard's question though, because he was in deep thought about something else. 

'If they are demons, then if we were to fight them… and I was to eat them, then would that increase my strength. How many would I need to eat before I could take on him?' Chris thought. 

——

Back in the cave, Hikel was pretty confident with his decision that he had chosen the right people to go, as it was nice and silent. Maybe he could close his eyes and enjoy time to himself. 

Closing his eyes, he soon heard scuffling across the floor with a few grunts as well. 

"What the!" Hikel stood straight up, as four strangers had suddenly appeared in the cave, with strange skull-like designs on their heads.
