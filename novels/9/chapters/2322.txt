Being a dhampir, there was one luxury that Jessica did get to enjoy compared to other vampires and that was sleep. Vampires struggled to sleep, and they didn't really need much in the first place, just a couple of hours would make them feel refreshed.

While in most cases, they could go a week without any sleep at all anyway. Although this was more because they just couldn't get to sleep if they tried, their bodies just weren't tired.

For Jessica, it was a mix, she could force herself to stay awake and in doing so there would almost be a second wave of an adrenaline rush that would wake her up, or she could sleep like normal.

For this she chose the latter, because sleep was something she absolutely loved, and if she didn't have a job would perhaps sleep in even longer. However, today wasn't one of those days that she could, she was hung up on the second letter she had received.

Her eyes were wide open as she stared at the dark ceiling in her room.

'The two letters had to come from the same person, and why not just tell me who they were. Why are they being so secretive about all of this? I'm seriously starting to think I have a full time stalker on my hands‚Ä¶ and if they know where I live they have to be in the Vampire Corps.

'Wait, that might not be the case, they could just have followed me home, but stalkers are more than likely someone you know right, I don't think this is something Galanar would do.'

Before she knew it, she had stayed up almost all night, and it was time for her to get ready for work once more. She was hoping that just like yesterday, that there would be no active cases.

Doing her job when she didn't feel well could be the difference between life and death. On her casual walk to work, she was casually looking at the faces of those walking by, passing humans and vampires.

It felt peaceful for her, then she came to a stop, as she was waiting to cross the street. She continued gazing at other people, until her eyes locked with a certain gentleman. He was a little taller than the others, his eyes showed a lot of age on them.

'Is he staring at me?' Jessica thought.

It was quite clear that the man was directly staring right at her, the two were making eye contact without a single one blinking.

'Who is he, I don't recognise him‚Ä¶ wait do I, does he seem familiar.'

The sound was made allowing one to cross the street, and at the brief moment she looked up making sure it was green for go, when she looked back she was unable to see the man.

She crossed the street, turning her head, looking through the crowd, but the man was nowhere to be seen.

'Could that man have been the one who sent the letters, could he be the stalker, but how did I lose sight of him?' She thought.

'Calm down, it might have just been all in your head, you get one night's bad sleep and now you're hallucinating.' She thought to herself, gulping down her fears and heading to work.

When heading into work, her mind was more scrambled than before, the image of the man was vividly in her head. She wondered, why did he seem so familiar? It was too real to just be a figment of her imagination.

'Have I really not seen that person before?'

"Jessica! Jessica!" a loud voice shouted.

Turning her head she could see that it was the chief, Barbra.

"I've been calling out your name, a few times now, on what planet is your mind on?"

Jessica was about to answer, with umms and r's but Barbra seemed to have something else to say.

"You better be on the ball today, you're one of my most trusted captains. Anyway, today, you have three new recruits joining you, so be on your A game."

"Three new recruits, at a time like this?" Jessica thought.

Currently the group was travelling via a levitating train. It had no tracks but a set path that would take them directly to where they needed to go. They thought about taking their ship, but both Hikel and Edvard wanted to enjoy trying something different and looking at the views outside of the window.

Quinn had to admit, it was nice seeing Earth's greenery, it was rather different compared to before. They had decided to head to where Jessica currently was.

They had received information from Logan that Jessica was in the Vampire Corps unit, from there it was easy to contact Andy and ask where exactly Jessica was. Things were a lot easier when you had connections, and weren't on the run or hiding.

Quinn remembered that Jessica used to be in the Vampire Corps, but came out of it, to pursue being a Traveller, he wondered why she had decided to go back.

"Okay, we're going to need to kinda talk about what we are going to do next. We heard from Andy that she is safe at the moment, but that could change by the time we get there." Edvard said.

Quinn was about to say something, the reason it was taking them slightly longer was because they wanted to go by train.

"Say she is safe, then what, do we just go off to the next target?"

"What are you suggesting?" Hikel asked, as it seemed like Edvard was going somewhere with this.

"Look, I've run my fair share of big organisations before. It might be hard for Magnus to make a move, which means that they could still very well be after her. Yet, we have no clue why they are going after her, or what they want to use her for.

"If we show up and hang around, do you really think Magnus is going to act? He's hidden from us this well so far, so searching for him isn't an option."

Quinn could see where he was going with this, and he wasn't so sure it was the best idea.

"So you want to use her as bait."

Edvard snapped his fingers and leaned back in his chair as if his job was done.

"Although you might not like it Quinn, I do believe it's our only chance. If we do manage to stop Magnus, we could find out the secrets of the dhampir." Hikel stated.

"That's if they are even after Jessica for that reason in the first place. Everything I said was more or less a guess." Quinn replied.

"Yes, but I think it's a good guess. Magnus right now, if they wanted to do you harm, could be targeting the general public or the vampire settlement, but he's not. Which means Immortui has entrusted him with a much more important task." Hikel said.

It was dangerous, Quinn didn't want to put anyone's life at risk. It was easy to just perhaps take Jessica someplace else, but he wouldn't be able to watch over her 24/7, and if they didn't stop Magnus, where would this end.

No, when Quinn thought about it even more, was stopping Magnus the end? Wouldn't immortui just continue to find another way. There was something that he himself perhaps needed to do that he had been putting off for a while now, but they would deal with Magnus first.

"So do you suggest we just watch her from afar?" Quinn asked. "Because I don't think that would work, we need to be close to her."

"Close to her without her knowing about us, and Magnus as well."

They all had their fingers on their chins as they thought about, until once again, Edvard was the one that snapped his fingers.

"I got it‚Ä¶ the answer is so easy. I mean you're friends with Fex and Andy right, don't they run the Vampire Corps. Then the answer is simple, join as a member of the Vampire Corps, and be part of Jessica's group!"
