Chapter 1049 - Nitro accelerate

With Quinn having left the north gate, it left Ko, Robin and Sil to deal with the Demi-god tier beast that had the appearance of a giant white furry Moth. The three of them needed to act fast, as they could see a number of their people who were fighting the beast collapsing onto the ground.

They weren‚Äôt dead, as they could still be seen breathing, but they still wouldn‚Äôt wake up despite what was going on around them. One had even been hit while asleep. It was an attack that was partially deflected off one of the Moth‚Äôs large wings. Yet, still they didn‚Äôt wake up.

"We can not allow that thing to get into the Shelter. If it does, it will cause everyone else to fall asleep, then the rest of the other beasts will cause even more mayhem!" Robin claimed.

"What are we meant to do? Whoever gets within ten meters seems to be hit by the beast‚Äôs fur that‚Äôs shedding from its body. It looks impossible to avoid and hard to see. All our ranged attacks seem useless as well." Ko explained.

The other Graylash members continued to fire lighting at the giant Moth, but it was seemingly doing nothing. As if it just tickled the beast. This was meant to be one of the strongest abilities out there.

Looking at the beast movements, Robin had noticed something. It hadn‚Äôt taken flight even with the two giant wings. An aerial beast sometimes was more difficult, so why was it on the ground?

It looked like it was constantly moving, every time someone got close to a certain part of its body, protecting a certain place. At one point, one of the travellers had gotten close to its under part as it ran under its head, fighting the loss of energy. When this happend, it leapt back for the first time swinging its powerful wings forward. As soon as it was in the air, it spun so one could only see its back.

"It‚Äôs the underbelly. I‚Äôm sure that is its weak point. With my soul weapon. I can create quite the powerful attack to damage it, but we will need someone to get close to it, and force it to show its belly" Robin explained.

Now the men that were continuing to fight the Moth were down to five. Pulling out his regular sword Ko had enough, and was about to jump off the wall, until he felt Sil grab his arm.

"What are you doing kid, get off me!" Ko shrugged it away. "If you‚Äôre just going to stand here and be useless, be useless somewhere else!"

Ko then lept of the wall, and stood in front of the gate, waiting for the right time to go in.

"Sil, is your name correct?" Robin said, turning to him. "Your power, if I fail, we might need to rely on you to finish the job. Owen told me a lot about you." Saying this, he held out his hand allowing Sil to touch him, and soon after he had leapt off the building as well.

Spirals of blue lightning started to surround Robin‚Äôs arms, and legs as he activated his soul weapon, but this was only one part of it, he needed to activate the second part of it to truly use the move he wanted and he was relying on another for this part of the plan.

"Damn it, it looks like it was holding back on what it could do, but this is the only chance I‚Äôll have!" Ko shouted as he lifted his sword back in the air above his head, tilting his back.

The other men were quickly falling asleep after being hit by the fur, so he had no choice but to use this opening. Activating his ability, his weapon grew in size. Becoming almost as big as the Moth itself. √öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

It was strange how one could still wield a beast weapon with its sheer size but the weight of the weapon had remained the same for Ko the ability user, only the size had changed. Swinging it down with all his might, hitting the Moth with a weapon this large would do something, and the Moth seemed to think this as well as it leapt backwards in the air.

The attack from Ko was fast, but the Demi-god tier beast was faster avoiding the blow. However, this was the plan in the first place. Now it was showing its white belly. It looked as if it was ready to turn around like before. Still, before it could, a large human sized blue lightning went straight past Ko‚Äôs head and straight to the Moth, hitting it in the centre part of its belly just under its head.

An explosion of blue occurred with lightning strikes firing off into the air. More of the Moth‚Äôs fur had been chucked everywhere. It fell to the floor rolling on the ground.

While Robin‚Äôs arms and legs were glowing in blue colour and slowly fading.

He was huffing and panting as his soul weapon had taken a lot out of him, but what was worse, for him and Ko both of them had been hit by the explosion of fur, and they could feel their bodies getting tired by the second.

It was a strange force like a spell draining the energy from both of them, making them incredibly tired.

"What is this, I thought it might have been a sleeping effect, but that‚Äôs not it at all!" Robin realised.

"It‚Äôs what I thought, this Moth is draining the energy from everyone to heal itself and make itself stronger. This fur, there has to be a way to get rid of it!" Robin started to think. Making a quick decision he placed both of his hands on himself.

Usually, users of the lightning power coated themselves with lightning to avoid getting hurt. After all, their bodies were not made of lightning itself. This time he had done no such thing and shocked himself repeatedly, making the pierces of fur from the Moth fall off his body.

His drained energy hadn‚Äôt returned, but it had finally stopped leaving him. Seeing Ko‚Äôs eyes, starting to become drowsy, he quickly fired and shocked him as well. He screamed in pain, but the pieces of fur that covered his body had fallen.

"What do we do!" Ko shouted, leaning on his sword stuck in the ground. He hadn‚Äôt used a lot of energy, but a lot of it had been drained, and he was relying on Robin for an answer. "The Moth looks like it‚Äôs fine to me," Ko said.

The truth was, using a soul weapon took a lot of energy, and it was the same for Robin. It was meant to be a trump card in a fight, but he had wanted to get rid of it quickly. In the past, Robin had always fought with others to help him along the way but now he saw no way of getting out of this one, until several lightning strikes seemed to hit the Moth, and unlike the others, with each one, it was creating a wound on the creature no matter where it hit.

Walking past Ko, Sil was seen with his hands out.

‚ÄôHe has lightning powers? But he isn‚Äôt part of the Graylash family! Didn‚Äôt the Cursed bring him along?‚Äô Ko thought.

"Where have you been?" Robin asked, smiling back at Sil.

"I had to get a few more abilities to make your powers stronger. It‚Äôs not the same as the world leaders, but it should be enough!" Sil shouted, firing off a constant stream of lighting. Now the whole of the Moth‚Äôs body was lighting up blue, and the blood was oozing from the beast‚Äôs body.

The lightning continued to leave his arms, and Ko couldn‚Äôt believe what he was seeing and eventually when the lightning had stopped. The beast was no longer moving in a pool of its own black blood.

It usually would have been a cause for celebration, and Robin was happy, but not Ko. He looked at his fallen comrades.

‚ÄôIf he could have done that from the beginning, then why? Why didn‚Äôt he come in earlier instead of waiting for everyone to get hurt!‚Äô Ko thought angrily.

And there was one more person he was annoyed at as well, Quinn who had seemingly disappeared and ran away, just where the hell was he?

At that moment, in the forest, Quinn with his special armour, was standing there waiting to see the beast, as trees were being broken down one by one, and the sound of the beast‚Äôs roars was getting closer.

"I have the new shadow skills I have learnt, the new blood skills, and even a new armour set. I would have liked to have used you to train even further and test these skills out, but I can‚Äôt waste any time on you." Quinn said.
