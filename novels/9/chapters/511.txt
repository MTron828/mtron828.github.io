Chapter 512 Little Army

The boys had finally arrived at the mountain, the place where they had first arrived. Logan and Vorden had recognized the entrance as it was the same when they had exited from with the others. It seemed like Timmy really did know his way through the forest after all.

"Are we sure we should go through this entrance?" Vorden asked. "If you remember, this way the tunnel will only lead us back to the bridge that Quinn broke, it might be hard to get in, and there was also a small problem with that... army."

"Army?" Timmy asked, trying to figure out just what they were referring to.

"He’s talking about wendigos. When we first arrived, we were placed in a lab, and there was an army of them chasing us." Logan replied.

Vorden shook his head, there was a reason why he was being careful with his words because he didn’t exactly want to frighten to frail Timmy. But Logan was blunt as always.

"Oh, I guess I must have missed them." A small slightly higher-pitched voice was heard, as a figure seemed to hope onto Vorden’s shoulder, which was Borden.

"Do you remember the entrance you came out from?" Logan asked.

Borden pointed towards the top of the mountain, and the others now had an idea of how he had missed facing off against all of the wendigos. "I just kept jumping going higher and higher, if there was something in my way, I would just punch my way out," Borden replied with a smile.

Based on his appearance now, they had forgotten just how strong this little fella was not too long ago.

"Timmy, maybe it’s best if you head back now, it’s going to be tough there. Maybe wendigos aren’t the only things we will see inside." Said Vorden.

"No," Timmy replied immediately. "My job is to be your guide, and I will be with you at all times. I know you think I will slow you guys down, or maybe I’m not strong enough. You don’t understand how hard it is for a vampire to get involved in stuff like that, which was why I didn’t help. Remember, I’m a vampire too. I’m stronger, and faster than both of you naturally and I learnt some of the book." Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Just then, spreading hands lifting his two arms mist started to form. He swirled the around, and the mist followed. It looked like he had indeed learnt the mist ability that Edward had used.

"Let the boy go in," Leo said. "I think it will be a good experience for you all. You must learn to get as strong as you can. As for where we should enter from, I think I can solve that problem for us."

Leo, with his ability, was able to see from a bird’s eye view at times. On top of this, whatever didn’t have an aura he would able to see a thin outline, like a wireframe. It was hard for people to call him blind when his ability allowed him to actually see more than others.

When using his ability, he had seen several entrances around the mountain top. There wasn’t just the one, and he had counted at least five, including one on the way when walking here.

The group chose one of the closest entrances to the one they had existed from before. They had no clue where each one would lead anyway, so they felt like there was no point spending too much time on picking.

The one who was in front of the group now, was Leo. While walking over, he was thinking of the group of kids. They had told him their theory, how they believed that the vampires might have been involved in creating the Dalki. At least they were able to develop beast similar to it.

Although Leo himself was a vampire, he never considered himself or even Quinn as a part of them. He felt their group as separate. If it was true and the vampires really did create the Dalki, then he had already decided that they would be his enemy as well.

Right now, he was on Quinn’s side. Not the army, but with Quinn and would hope he would be able to steer him in the right direction, like a general of some sort and he saw these kids in front of him as his troops.

Which is why if they ever needed to fight or break off from these temporary alliances with the vampires. He needed to make Quinn’s little army, stronger.

So he thought it was best to let Timmy, and the other students fight. Get experience from this little trip. Not everything could be done on thier own.

As soon as Leo had this thought, something strange had happened.

[A vampire knight squad has been formed]

[4/10]

[Vampire knight’s buff has been applied]

[Error, three non-vampires discovered.]

[Buff will only have a 50 percent effect on non-vampires]

It was a system message, the first time Leo had received something like this, and it looked like it had something to do with him becoming a vampire knight. When Leo thought about looking after these kids and training them. They had gone into his squad. The buff was meant to be a 10 percent increase in all stats. However, that only applied to vampires, but it looked like non-vampires were able to do the same as well.

The message came as a small surprise, but he was sure it had something to do with Quinn’s unique situation.

The boys had entered the entrance at this point, which looked to be another cave that dug into the mountain. Only this one rather than starting from the bottom of the mountain, started from near the middle and was heading downward.

They had entered inside, and as expected, there was a downward slope as they walked. The two vampires were able to see easily while Vorden and Logan used a few light crystals attached to the outside of their clothing.

Logan had designed these especially, so they weren’t too bright, as to not affect his comrades. He had made this keeping in mind about the other vampires he might travel with. Not just for Leo, who wasn’t affected by such lights.

There were many tunnels that would lead off and such from the original entrance they had come in from, but thankfully with Leo guiding them, he was able to see a distance faintly down some of them. Sensing that most of the tunnels lead to a dead end.

That was when the system message had occurred, while Leo was deep in his thoughts.

At this point and time, each one of them felt strange energy take over their body. It was a hit, a sudden dose and boost in power to them all.

"What’s happening, is it something to do with the mountain?" Timmy asked.

"It feels similar to when I took those red pills we found in the lab. Like I just feel stronger." Vorden replied.

"I believe that it has something to do with me," Leo said. "When Quinn made me into his vampire knight, there were some changes, and it appears that this is one of them," Leo replied.

’Vampire knight, isn’t that the leader’s right-hand man?’ Sil said. It had been a while since Sil had spoken. Honestly, while in the vampire world, his skills weren’t really needed. Vorden was unable to copy any vampire abilities, and right now, he actually had none.

Logan’s ability was useless to him, and Cia no longer had hers. It had gone past the twenty-four hour mark, so the only thing he could rely on when fighting was his own skills. Truthfully he was happy that Leo came along.

’No," Sil said. ’We have been with Quinn the longest. We should be his right-hand man. Tell Quinn to make us a vampire knight.’

’I understand, but it’s just a title. He’s not really Quinn’s right-hand man, we’re still his best friend.’ Vorden said, trying to calm down Sil a little. ’You know we can’t become a vampire. We can’t lose this power.’

Vorden expected Sil to carry on complaining, but as soon as he had heard that, he decided to go back in the black room and mind his business once again. The only time he got up seemed to be when he heard Quinn’s name.

’If I leave the vampire settlement early, maybe I should go pay them a visit.’ Vorden thought. It was something he didn’t want to do but felt like it was expected. After he had used their name several times, they still hadn’t contacted him. He was sure his siblings would be making a fuss over it, so he should at least return to see what they were thinking and how they were doing.

With Leo’s guidance, the tunnel walls started to become wider taller and bigger. The wall was no longer built with cave and stone as more metallic surfaces could be seen, and the flooring had smoothed out.

Finally, they had reached a large hanger, which had a metallic door. It looked similar to the ones at the lab they were in but different at the same time.

By the side, there was a computer, Logan, of course, went to it to try to see if there was any way he could open it. But just like several other items in this strange mountain, it didn’t listen to him at all.

"Well, the door is made from galthrium, and I can’t use my ability to open it up." He said with a smile. Which seemed strange considering he would usually be down about something like this, but the reason for him feeling happy was because he knew they were in the right place.

"It’s a good thing you didn’t open that door." Leo said, "Because there is a little army of creatures on the other side."

Timmy gulped hearing this, with his hand slightly shaking.

"Are they strong?" Vorden asked.

"It should be something we can deal with," Leo replied.

"That still doesn’t help us from getting in," Timmy said.

Leo started to walk forward past the group, and Logan went back to join the others.

"I think we better get ourselves ready." Said Vorden, pulling out his two blades from his back.

"What do you mean?" Timmy asked.

With his hand on the hilt of his blade around his waist. Leo prepared himself, and in an instant. Made a slash placing his sword back into its sheath again. A few seconds later, and a red line of aura could be seen appearing on the hanger like door diagonally. Then it fell on to the floor, and the door was cut open.

On the other side, an army of wendigos.
