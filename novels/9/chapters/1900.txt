The Celestials all had something similar to Quinn, a system that allowed them to send messages to each other. Although the feature for Quinn to send out messages to others was recently unlocked, and it looked like that happened because he had levelled up, Quinn didn't really have any friends in the Celestial space, and if he was to send a message to Bliss and the others, it would just be a load of hate anyway so it was unlikely they would reply.

Since he had chosen to ignore it, he had somewhat forgotten that it even existed, and yet here, there was a message in front of him from the one and only person that knew who he was.

'What does she want?' Quinn thought as his finger hovered over the button to open the message up. 'Every time I have gotten involved with her, something ends up going wrong.'

Truthfully, Quinn had somewhat forgiven her for what she had done to him. That was because during his journey he had learnt a lot from the other planets and it was quite enjoyable.

In the end, nothing had gone wrong either, everything was fine, and everyone was safe when he returned. However, there was one thing that he could never forgive, and it was the reason why he was filled with anger at the moment.

It was the fact that she had taken the shadow from Minny at the time. The shadow was there to protect her, and the way Minny had described how scared she was at the time, and to do that to someone he cared about, it was something that the b*tch deserved getting hit in the face for, even if it was just once.

"Is everything alright, Quinn? If you want, we can always visit my father later. After all, he has all the time in the world." Andy said, approaching carefully.

Thankfully, his words got through to Quinn and calmed him down a little. Now, an internal debate had started inside him because he was wondering if he should open the message and read it or not or continue on with getting Fex out of that box he had been in for a while.

"Arghhh, this is so annoying," Quinn said out loud, which made Andy wonder what could the legendary Hero possibly be struggling with.

This was a person that had it all, had the strength to change and do whatever he wished. It was hard to imagine if a horde with a demon-tier beast didn't give him trouble, what could?

In the end, Quinn felt like he had no choice, otherwise, the contents of the message would just bug him forever.

[I know you don't like me.]

It was the first line of the sentence, and that was nearly enough to just make Quinn close the message, but he continued reading.

[However, whether you like it or not, the two of us have the same goal, and that is protecting the people on Earth. Ray eventually realised that, and he was a Talen, and you are one as well, so I hope you will realise that.

[Earth is in trouble, in serious trouble, and I mean it. Otherwise, I wouldn't be contacting you right now. Someone needs your help, and if they don't get it, then you and everyone could be in serious trouble.

[Travel to these locations... It is urgent to get there as soon as possible!!!]

The end of the message was a bunch of numbers that Quinn really didn't understand, but they looked like the universal coordinates that one could input into the ships to assign a destination. Which meant the place where Quinn needed to be was most likely not on Earth.

'What is this... can't she just be clear about what she wants me to do? It sounds like she wants to meet me... or me to meet someone else. This whole thing could be a trap again by her to send me away.

'Although, if that happens, I could try and contact Yongbu to send me back to Earth, right? Either way, this is seriously annoying because she didn't mention any details other than the fact that it sounds like I'm going to need to fight.'

Thinking about it for a while, looking at Andy, and then turning and looking at Minny, Quinn sighed as he had made his decision.

"I'm sorry, Andy, but something urgent has come up. I promise I will be back soon, and I hope you aren't so busy and can help me out then."

Before Andy could reply, Quinn covered himself in shadows and had taken Miny into his shadow space again. Just as he left, there was a large smile on Andy's face.

'You idiot, I will always have time for someone like you.' Andy thought. 'Now I'm starting to understand why my father liked you so much.'

As for what Quinn was doing, he was using the shadow link to hop to someone who had recently woken up, and Quinn soon found himself inside Logan's lab, surrounded by everyone.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

"Quinn, what are you doing here?" Alex asked, and the other races were confused as well.

"Whoa, you can do that?" Jake said.

Vincent, Jake, Logan and Alex seemed to be talking about something in the lab. Unbeknownst to Quinn, Jake had just returned with the items that were needed.

"I'm sorry, but this is quite an urgent matter. It looks like I need to go somewhere. Logan, can you input these coordinates and tell me where they lead to?" Quinn asked as he read out a bunch of numbers.

Quinn could see a bunch of crystals that were in Alex's hands. He could tell that there were a couple of demon tier crystals in there, however, there was no Nest crystal as requested.

"I'm sorry, I couldn't find a nest crystal, but I thought if I came back and gave the demon tier items first that he could work on that," Jake explained what Quinn was thinking.

"Don't worry," Quinn replied as he summoned his own demon tier crystal and handed it to Alex. "I managed to get my own Nest crystal."

"Finding a nest crystal and a demon crystal in such a short time. Well, you are still impressing me as always." Vincent commented. It had been a long time since he had seen Quinn, seen his strength, so he currently had no idea what Quinn was capable of.

"Well, this is great! I can start making the weapons straight away, and with you here, we can add your blood just like you asked." Alex suggested.

There was a hesitant look on Quinn's face, and not one of joy like Alex had expected.

"What's wrong?" Alex asked.

"You said that the weapons would take maybe a week or so to make, right? So you need my blood at some point during the process. How early do you need my blood?"

Quinn didn't want to delay the process of the weapons at all. Once he had the weapons and the location of Erin and Zero, he would be off. The only thing was, right now, he needed to be somewhere else as well.

"Ah...I guess you need to be somewhere. Well, I actually only need it in the starting phase, but it will take me about an hour or so to get ready. Is that okay?" Alex asked.

"Quinn!" Logan shouted. "Those coordinates, they're on Venus. I have a teleporter that will get you there quite quickly if need be."

Venus was a habitable planet. The greenhouse gases had been removed from the planet, making it a bearable place to live, but it was still relatively hot compared to others. However, the people that lived there were more neutral than anything, just those not wanting to get involved in any of the mess. It had a low population as well.

It was strange that this location was given, so Logan was assuming the worst, which was why he had made his suggestion.

"One hour, right? Okay, I'll give you that one hour. Let's work on this now!" Quinn ordered.

Hoping that whatever he was needed for could wait.
