Chapter Ôªø1887 No Trouble at all

The fifty creatures in front of them were all at the Demi-god level. Although Erin didn't think anyone in the group would have trouble dealing with all fifty on their own, to come out of such a thing unscathed would be troublesome, even for her with the fire-shooting powers.

Perhaps she would have to actually push herself and treat the battle as a real challenge if she didn't want to get hurt.

This was why Erin was quite impressed with what she was seeing right now. The strange red aura was blocking all the incoming attacks, and they didn't seem to be weakening it one bit. Struggling to understand how this was possible, Erin decided to close her eyes to use other senses.

When doing so, she could sense it clearly now. With the help of her ability, she could tell that the power wasn't coming from Agent Four himself. Instead, it was coming from what he was wearing.

'Armour that allows one to produce blood aura? And I can't even gauge if this thing has a limit. I wonder if it can do anything else.' Erin thought.

"Well, it would be a good chance to train, don't you think? While one of us is blocking the attacks, it would be nice if someone could deal with the annoyances on the other side." Zero suggested and smiled.

'Show me, show me the strength you have, the strength you had to take down the leader of the Red Vampires.' Zero squinted his eyes. Even though he had carefully observed Erin training with Flora, it wasn't enough because there was a plan brewing in Zero's head.

'I need to see if I'm strong enough to get rid of you.' Zero inwardly smiled.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

While shooting out the strange fireballs from their mouths, the beasts also continued to charge toward them. Erin was ready to pull out her weapon, but before she could, Flora ran ahead.

Pulling out from underneath the armour she was wearing where her breastplate was, Flora had a small little vile that was filled with red liquid. She then splashed it across the legendary sword and swung it from her side.

As she did, the sword swung out wide, as if it was attached by a piece of string, and headed towards the horde at a fast speed. The second the sword touched the first beast, it sliced off its head, but that wasn't the end of the attack.

The sword lit up slightly again, and explosions started to go off one by one. It ripped through the beast in the front while exploding and dealing with the ones on the other side.

'Flora has managed to improve with the weapon quite a bit.' Erin thought. 'And I have learned something about that strange power Agent Four uses. The blood barrier is still up and blocking attacks, but it seems like it can't block attacks from this side.

'I guess Agent Four has the power to control which attacks he lets in and out, but it only works one way.'

Similar to Zero, Erin was also vigilant and had kept a close eye on Agent Four and Zero because she felt like there was a high chance that coming to this secluded planet could be a trap.

After the initial strike from Flora, two-thirds of the beast horde had perished, and many of them were severely injured. Flora then started to swing and pinch the string from where she was in certain ways to make the sword move where she wished.

The sword looked like it was flying as it struck down the beasts one by one. They were clearly no match for the sword, and all of them were soon dealt with. Once the job was done and the sword returned, Flora couldn't help but smile while looking at it.

'Without this sword, I would have never been able to have done something like that, to defeat an army of Demi-god tier beasts. Just what is this thing, and who does it belong to?' Flora thought, fascinated by the sword.

Erin walked over to check on her, but at the same same time, she leaned in and whispered in her ear.

"Save the rest of the blood vials unless you absolutely need it. Even if we are struggling against the Demon-tier, don't use them unless we have to."

Since the sword needed blood to activate, rather than using her own blood, which also worked with the weapon, Flora had brought along about fifteen blood vials to use on the sword, but now only fourteen were left.

"I hope this has scared any of the weaker beasts who are observing us from a distance." Agent Four said, pushing his glasses onto his nose. "Now, we can focus on the bigger things we have to deal with."

The four of them started to scale the mountain, but unlike before, where they walked through the landmass, Agent Four started to run, and so did Zero. After that, they all started to scale the mountain making large leaps.

The path that was being made by Agent Four was quite impressive, and his skills with Qi were great as well, great enough to put him as one of the best.

'I guess he isn't just a man of science after all, and it makes sense if he was able to come to a dangerous planet like this one.'

Eventually, the group reached the top, and Agent Four immediately put the tablet away as they all could see the enemy in front of them.

It was huge in size, around the same size as a school bus, it had the face of what looked like a dragon, and it also had three tales that curved back, each of them had stingers on like that of a scorpion.

It was clear just from looking at it that this was the demon-tier beast.

"What...what should we do first!"

The demon-tier beast had already charged toward them on the ground, and the three singers started to glow a bright red in colour. The air around and above the stingers was distorted, and one could only imagine how hot such a thing was, but just like before, Agent Four stood calm and raised his hand.

As the three stingers were launched towards Agent Four, once again, the red barrier had appeared, blocking the attack. No matter how much the Demon tier beast would pull back and attempt to attack, nothing was getting through.

Since the Demon tier beast was distracted, this also allowed Agent Zero to prepare his own attack. He was holding onto the handle of his sword still in its sheath. Slowly, a huge amount of energy began to build up, and quickly, the sword was pulled out and put straight back in the sheath again.

The next moment, the three singers from the ground fell onto the floor.

"You can't be doing all the work here," Zero said. "This is meant to be a group effort."

Pulling out her large demon-tier sword from her back, Erin was ready to act. After a minute had passed, the demon-tier beast had been defeated, and Flora was left speechless.

In the battle, she had done nothing to join in the fight.

'Demon-tier breasts are meant to be one of the strongest things in the world, right? Many strong people, even the strongest, struggle against them, so how did the three of them make it look so easy.'

The crystal was extracted and passed to Agent Four, and with the beast dead, no injuries and none of them tired, it looked like they were ready to move on to the next location.

"A Demon tier crystal of this calibre won't give us much", Zero complained. "Agent Four, move us into more difficult beings."

Although Demon tier beasts were the highest tier of beasts, there was a large and varying range in terms of strength between them. For instance, even a humanoid demon tier beast was far stronger than a regular one like they had dealt with.

However, there was something that was seriously concerning for Agent Four because he noticed a reading of something off in the distance that was going off the charts, something beyond that of a demon-tier beast.
