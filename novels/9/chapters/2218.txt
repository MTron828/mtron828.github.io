The effect of the armour was beyond what Stark could ever imagine. Everything around him was moving as if time had stopped, and he was leaving H far in the dust, just as he intended.

The Nitro accelerate skill and the armour wasn't something that could just be used by anyone. Due to the sheer speed, it also meant that one's brain had to keep up and be able to process the fast information that it was receiving.

Otherwise, everything would be a blur, they would crash constantly and wouldn't be able to use the full capabilities of the armour. With Stark though, that was never a worry for Quinn.

He had the greatest processing speed because he was fast, and Stark was constantly trying to reach new heights with his speed. It was almost as If his brain was actually too fast to keep up with his body.

This armour was perfect for him, and he just wished that he could keep such a thing.

'I have to stick to the mission, I have to stick to the orignal goal.' Stark thought.

He continued to run, and altough time felt like it stopped. In reaility he only had three minutes. In this time, he had to find out where the ships currently were on the giant vessel, and then fly off before anyone could stop him.

'This is an important job, and it's one that only I can do.' Stark thought.

He went through multiple areas that had next to no people, but somewhat remembered the path of where they had gone with Jake and Vicky, and soon he could see people. If he could see people, then it meant it was a good sign, because that's where the army currently was, and where the ships and pods would be.

'I hope that H is still following me, and even if he isn't, that I was able to give the others enough time to get away.'

Stark was able to get the gist of what needed to be done, and what Layla was planning. Knowing that Sil was the most important person to H, H would go wherever Sil was. Since Stark was fast, he could grab Sil and avoid H's attacks.

Even if H could teleport to him, Stark could still quickly move out of the way and avoid him, but he wanted him to stay close, to get H as far away as possible from the others.

Then, when there was enough distance, he would use Nitro Accelerate to get out of here. The only problem was, H's lighting strike was a little faster than he thought. Maybe he could have avoided it, but he panicked and activated the armour's skill.

With no way to see H, he was unsure if he was still following him.

It didn't take long for Stark to find where all the ships were, and strangely most of them were unused. As if they seemed to prefer the pods. Quickly moving still at a speed others were unable to see him at.

Stark managed to take out the men around one of the ships, and headed to the door where the hatch would open to the outside. He then opened up the ship's glass pod, got Sil in and closed the top of the hatch. Although he was fast, the ship itself wasn't, so he had to take out some of the humans nearby.

In real time, for those that were around the ships, everything was just so confusing. They had no clue what was going on, what was happening, and could just see a ship lifting up, and breaking straight out.

The men were still trying to figure out why the door to space was opening, and why people were falling, allowing for the ship to successfully escape.

Now riding peacfully in space, Stark looked back at Sil in the seat behind him, still fast asleep.

'That was a bit more intense then I thought it would be, and a bit easier than I imagined as well.' Stark thought. 'But, they all risked thier lives for you. You must be a pretty big deal, so I hope you wake up soon, because we can't run forever‚Ä¶ at some point, we're going to have to fight that monster.'

Inside the Marpo Cruise, after Stark and H had left, Shiro was quick to work, teleporting them all down to the floor below, and had taken Jake and Vicky with him.

"Dad, dad answer!" Jake shouted at the spider on his arm.

"We managed to somehow get away from H‚Ä¶ what do we do, what's the plan from here?"

Logan didn't speak for a while, it was clear that this wans't part of the plan, so he had to think of somethign.

"Right now, everyone on the ship will be looking for you. It will be hard to move, quickly or silently." Logan explained. "It will slow you down, and eventuelly H will catch up to you. So there is only one thing I can do. I will cause a large distraction and, I think it's time that all three of us left‚Ä¶"

Those words to Layla, had brought her great joy, because she knew what he meant by them. It was the fact that Logan would be coming back with them.

"With Sil no longer in thier hands, it means they can't change our memroies anymore. I see no way out other than to reveal myself‚Ä¶ Let's move quickly."

They followed Logan's orders as he updated his son on the location they needed to get to, but they did wonder just what type of distraction would Logan cause? One that would be big enough for them all to escape.

In one of the preparation rooms, where several pods were in place and would be launched from, there was a room filled with Androids, all powered by beast crystal, and all of them made by Logan Green.

It was his way of assisting in the war, but they had yet to be used, because of an apparent malfunction.

"Hey!" One of the men shouted. "The Android, it's online, it's on-"

Before the man could finish his sentence, he was shot in the stomach with a blaster that had sent him flying across the room.

Soon after, all of the androids in the room, 1000 of them were online and all of them were attacking the Dalki and the humans.

It was complete chaos in the Marpo Cruise. At first they were to search for some intruders and now all of this was happening. Jack had quickly gotten the reports, as he was making his way to Logan.

'I knew it‚Ä¶ I knew he would betray us.' Jack said.

He opened the door, to the lab that he had provided Logan, expecting to see him there, but instead, in his place, there was a hologram.

"You should start thinking a few moves ahead." The hologram of Logan said with a smile.DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé

Several beeps went off in the room, and explosion after explosion went off one after another. Everything was being destroyed in the lab, and Jack had no choice but to dive out of the way back out of the lab.

The sleeves of his shirt were burnt as he laid there on the floor.

"DAMNNN IT!!!!" Jack shouted.

Through all the distractions, the group had eventually met up at one of the quieter locations, and with Logan's soul weapon he could create a makeshift ship for them relatively quickly that they could use to get out of the place, which was exactly what they did.

While travelling through space, Jack stood up, and recomposed himself, he allowed for the anger to settle down a little bit.

"So you have managed to escape, you told me that I am the one that needs to think one step ahead. Well you have no idea what you are heading to‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶ there's nothing left." Jack smiled.

‚Äî‚Äî

Having set off before the others, Stark had landed on the planet they had originally left from. He had done so in the city, but it wasn't the same as he remembered, because everything had been destroyed, and the whole city was filled with the dead.
