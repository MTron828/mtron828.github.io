Chapter 2535 ¬†The Final Form

In the red space, the area in which Immortui and Quinn were facing each other, the landscape had vastly changed. From their fight and the destruction of the ground, they had already removed several layers of the ground.

It was hard to see anything but broken land as far as the eyes could see. However, the area, just like in the settlement, was being covered with white coloured energy portals that were opening up.

From these energy portals, the Divine Brigade was coming through. They had nothing in the area to attack, other than Immortui and Quinn, and that's exactly what they did. They were harmless to the two, like a swarm of flies, but even a swarm of flies could be annoying at times.

Fighting against the swarm that had come at them, Quinn had stopped as he looked to his side. He could see dark coloured wings made from the shadow's power. Along with the long hair, it was bringing back memories, memories that had only returned recently.

"Arthur!" Quinn called out.

Turning slightly, there was a smile on his face. Quinn had to blink a few times wondering if it was real or not. As two more Divine beings came toward him, Arthur swung his sword slicing one in half, then with his other hand he blasted out a blood canon, hitting it directly in the face.

If this was his imagination, then it shouldn't have been able to deal with the Divine beings in the area close to him.

"I will deal with these annoying disturbances." Arthur said. "Quinn, you do your job."

Thinking about it more, Quinn started to think how it was possible and soon remembered Russ' ability. It could have been Russ, or quite possibly it was Sil as well. Either way, he was thankful that he wasn't on his own in this.

It gave Quinn a bit more confidence.

Looking at Immortui, he could see he was busy taking down the Divine beings, using large scale Red mist attacks. With each swing, he would take out a few hundred.

Diving in, Quinn wasted no time, and placing his hand out, a shadow portal was created in front of him. Going through the shadow, Quinn appeared right out of another one and it was right by Immortui's side.

He twisted his fist, and the blood shadow energy started to spin rapidly like a drill. It pounded right into Immortui's chest.

Immortui's leg gave out for a moment, as it cracked the ground beneath him from the sheer power. When he tried to get back up, the second wave of the attack had hit as well, and on top of that, several of the Dark Divine beings thrust their spears right at Immortui.

There were those that had done the same to Quinn, aiming for him, but a wall of shadow had appeared blocking the attack, and soon after, a large sword was swung, slicing off their heads, exploding them on impact.

Arthur was doing as he stated he would and was protecting Quinn to the best of his abilities.

Gathering the red mist power in his body, Immortui shoved both his hands out and a ball of aura was sent outward. It blasted and looked as if it was forcing all of the Divine beings away.

It hadn't affected Quinn though, who was still pushing forward. From the serpent on his back a laser fired out, but Quinn had blocked it with his wing.

With his other wing open, he used the skill again.

[Blood rain] FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

Like bullets, small droplets of blood started to hit Immortui over and over on his body.

'My chest, it hurts from where he hit me from before. His power in this form is no joke. He is far stronger compared to before. How‚Ä¶ how could a being that was created from me, be able to reach such power?'

"I know exactly what your thinking!" Quinn stated, as he used the shadow travel to travel into the ground.

The serpents opened up their mouths firing energy blasts trying to hit Quinn but the shadow had spread out like an entire pool, filling the entire ground. When it hit the shadow it seemingly did nothing.

Rising up from the shadow, Quinn was now right behind Immortui, and grabbed onto both of the serpents' necks behind him.

"My power, it might have originally come from you, but the strength I have now, is not just from you!" Quinn screamed and opened up his mouth, this close it was time for him to use another skill.

[Shadow Blood Screech has been activated]

Quinn's mouth stretched wide, and the sides of his mouth ripped open. A large visible sound wave was emitted out, creating ripples in the air. They constantly hit Immortui's head over and over again.

He could feel the armour on his body reacting, it was shaking as the screech hit him again and again, and his vision, it was fading with each hit, his sense of hearing, his sense of touch, slowly he was losing it all.

'What‚Ä¶ is this power?' Immortui thought.

Eventually Immortui could see absolutely nothing, he couldn't even feel the touch on his body.

Seeing the state Immortui was in. Quinn quickly lifted his leg, and slammed it on the top of his head, slamming his whole body into the ground.

Right after he raised his hand. The gauntlets started to form into something else. His blood was being used to create a different weapon entirely. It started to curve out making a large edge, and now it was held firmly in both of his hands.

He had made a giant scythe out from his blood. It was fully condensed.

"I know killing you won't be the end. You'll just come back, again and again, but even then, at least there will be a moment of peace for the world. Whether it's 10 years, or a 1000 years until your return, you will remember this moment!"

Quinn swung the scythe down, and it hit Immortui's neck. It was pushing into his skin, and blood was being drawn from it, but he had grabbed onto the blade and was hair now was made of several serpents, just like those that wrapped around his arm. It pushing away with his hand.

Immortui, with his other hand, had used the colourless power on his own body. He had placed an orb inside of him, getting rid of the defect of Quinn's screeching power. He had to pull the orb out quickly and he managed to see the scythe just in time to stop it.

"You‚Ä¶ are nothing to me. I'll show you, I'll show you exactly why the Ancient Ones feared me!" Immortui said. Gripping tightly, the scythe's end broke, and the whole ground started to shake.

The red mist energy was swirling into Immortui, and his armour was shaking. It covered his body, and the serpents started to turn into a strange dark goo. The goo was combined with his body, as well as the armour on him.

In the first place it always seemed strange, the armour didn't look like armour but was more a part of his body. It continued to blend. Immortui's mouth started to grow large fangs on the side.

Fur started to cover over his arms and his hands were large and clawed. Out from the back, a spiked tail grew out. The spikes were glowing and beaming with red energy.

Red crystals were emerging from his back, constantly glowing with power, and his hair now was made of several serpents, just like those that wrapped around his arm. It now looked like there were hundreds of small ones behind him.

This was Immortui's final form.
