The Skullys' village was a mess, with panic set all over the place. Several of the buildings had been destroyed, the main hall, the local shops, the hunting grounds and more, and the Skullys were in a panic.  Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The thing was, the sight of the Durum demons entering their village wasn't a strange one. This had been going on for an extremely long time now. The Durum demons would arrive and ask for a number of the Skullys to volunteer to get into the cages. 

At times there would be many that decided to volunteer themselves and when they did, they never saw them come back. This time, it was just like any other, only once in a while something would occur. 

The Durums were standing by their ten specially made containment cages. There were groups of around five Durum demons per cage, making them around fifty in total. 

There was no need to send this many demons for a village of Skullys as often there would only be two hundred or so per village. The Skullys groups were usually small but many spread across the planet. 

This was mainly due to the fact that even though they were the same, they were unable to get along with each other, and there would be constant battles against one another. Even when the demons arrived, battles would continue between each other over the smallest of things.

One of the Durum demons stood forward, he looked at all of the Skullys that were staring up at him. "I see!" He said. "It looks like none of you want to volunteer this time, well I guess that just means we will choose." 

The demon raised his hand, and the Skullys jumped away. They were fast on their feet but the crystals were already shot out from the demon's hands and pierced the Skully in the leg. 

Not even removing the crystals, the demon lifted the Skully causing the crystals that pinned him to the ground to rip through his flesh. Then chucked him into the red crystal cage. 

"Careful now, if you try to escape, the crystal cage will blow up and fire off shards in all directions, including towards those on the inside." The demon laughed, all thoughts of escape immediately left the Skully's head at that moment.

That was the start of the chaos in the village. All of those that were brave enough to sacrifice themselves had already done so, and as they saw more and more not coming back, they started to fear the visit from the Durum demons. 

At the same time, the demons didn't have a set time that they would arrive, it could be several years, maybe even generations before they visited the village again. Or possibly just a few months. 

The demons would travel to different villages but it seemed at random, the only thing they were concerned about were the Skullys going extinct so once a village reached its breaking point they would tend to leave it alone after. 

What was currently happening now, was the breaking point for this village, and it was one of the most fun times for the demons. All of them took part as if it was another hunting game, making their own points system for how many they could capture and throw into the cages. 

Meanwhile, some of the Skullys were even fighting amongst themselves. If they injured some of their fellow villagers, then they were put in the cage, and there was a good chance that they wouldn't get taken away. 

Some of the demons seeing this, even allowed for two of them to fight, waiting for the victor and throwing the loser in. They did this because it encouraged even more infighting between the two.

That's when something had occurred that caused everyone to stop. A loud crash that cracked the ground, energy that spilled out to the side had hit everyone in the village like a wave. 

When they turned their heads, they could see a person that didn't look like a Skully nor a Durum standing there, holding up a Skully in his hands by his throat, next to a dead body of a demon.

ραΠdαsΝοvel.cοm "Hey Peter, what are you doing, can't you tell the difference between good and bad?" Edvard said, as he walked over towards the others. He walked through both Durum and Skully as if they were nothing while Sil followed behind. 

They followed with their heads at the two strangers, they felt out of place in the middle of all the chaos.

"Good or bad?" Peter replied. "Just because one side is losing, doesn't mean the other side is bad." 

"He has a point." Sil said. "And a couple of these guys seem to be fighting each other as well." 

Sil hadn't liked this place since he had entered, he had overheard many different things, and it wasn't a place he wanted to stay in long.

"What are you doing just staring off into space, get those intruders and lock them up!" One of the demons shouted. 

Now that the situation had turned into this, Sil decided to get involved himself. HIs entire arm was covered in blue lightning, it was swirling around. His eyes lit up, and he slammed his hand onto the floor. 

Lightning currents were sent out in all directions, and targeted both the Skullys and the Demons. As it touched their skin, the lightning would electrify their bodies from the ground. 

Some of the Skullys attempted to jump away, but the lightning was still able to move from the ground striking them while they were mid air. As it hit the Skullys it would cause them to faint on the spot, foaming at the mouth, and passing out. 

Meanwhile for the demons the lightning passed through their bodies and the attack would be shifted to the crystals on their back. It lit them up like a Christmas tree before the energy would disappear completely, the demons were unaffected completely.

"Hey, what are you doing, only hurting the small guys?" Edvard asked. "Between you and Peter, now I feel really bad for them." 

"I didn't aim for them, things have just turned out this way." Sil answered. The main goal was to knock everyone out with his lightning powers. There were times where a certain ability wouldn't work and this appeared to be one of those times, or the enemy was a bit stronger than he first thought."

Sil was getting ready to use another ability, when something had happened to all of the Durum demons. Once again their backs started to light up. All of them had done it at the same time, but it wasn't just their backs, it was all the crystals on their body, including those in their eyes. 

"Kronker… he must have transformed." One of the demons said. "That was the order. Everyone stop we have to leave and go to Nebton quickly!"

Smiling, Edvard had a good feeling based on the way the demons were acting. There was a reason why he wanted to be part of the search group for Quinn, because he thought his good luck would lead him to them.
