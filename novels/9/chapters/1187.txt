Chapter 1188 The Cursed Faction Family

Before Quinn was to meet with Helen, he decided to do a bit of reading on the reports that had been given to him from Sam. The reports themselves gave details of each planet that the Cursed faction owned, the crystal output of each one, and the quality of crystals from each faction.

On top of this, it had a rating set for the different Shelters based on the planet. All the factions that they worked with and were technically allied with the Cursed faction. Looking at the holographic screen before him, Quinn was trying his best to memorise what he could.

‚ÄôEighteen planets in total, and three A rank plus Shelters, one of them which used to belong to the Daisy faction.‚Äô Quinn was trying to remember the details. ‚ÄôI never realised how big the Cursed faction was or how much work Sam and the others have been doing. The information has even been put in a way for me, so it‚Äôs easy to understand.‚Äô

It was true, Sam had worked with Logan in order to sort the information so it could visualise the importance of each planet. It was set up like each planet was a game with different stats. Different Shelters had higher and lower numbers of people living in them. But they were all just important.

Sometimes, Travelers families wouldn‚Äôt live on the same planet and opted for a safer one. At the same time, they worked on the more dangerous planets. Crystal output was greater on lower-tier planets, yet high tier crystals planets had a lower output but higher grades.

Even with the factions themselves, the strength wasn‚Äôt as simple as Quinn first thought. The planets with more dangerous tier beasts had higher level Shelters. Usually, only one faction worked and reported to Daisy on these, which in turn reported to the Cursed faction. Still, for other planets, there would sometimes even be multiple factions.

‚ÄôI can imagine all the arguments that they would have to deal with already.‚Äô Quinn thought.

What came as a surprise was as soon as Quinn had come close to the planet, there was already a fleet of ships surrounding him. Seeing them reminded him of a bad feeling since the last time this had happened, they were attacked. However, this was vastly different from the time before, especially since the design of the ships were...unique, to say the least.

Each one had been personalised beyond what others would usually do. All set in bright colours that stood out with painted pictures, or stickers, whatever they were, all over the ships. Straight away, Quinn knew that these were from the Daisy faction.

Soon a request was put in for Quinn to accept an incoming message.

"It‚Äôs nice to meet you again, I hope you can stay for a while this time, so I can give you a well and proper tour."

The voice on the other end was none other than Helen. The small ship, docked inside one of the larger ones that picked Quinn up, and now he was travailing in the daisy ship.

When Quinn descended from his spaceship, he was surprised to see that only one person was there to welcome him.

"I didn‚Äôt want you to be scared since I know what happened with the Earthborn group. Well, I think everyone knows what happened, so I thought this whole tour would go better with someone you trusted a little more." Helen said.

When looking at Helen, Quinn couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her for a few reasons. For one, he would often see her in some type of battle outfit, this time was no different, but the armour allowed for one to see a bit more skin than Quinn was used to.

Especially in the upper department, since she was wearing a tight like corsets beast gear that pushed up a certain pair of twins in the chest department. At the same time, her pink hair was vibrant as ever, as if she had just finished having it coloured.

‚ÄôQuinn, I would be a little careful with this one.‚Äô Vincent commented. ‚ÄôI think she knows exactly what she‚Äôs doing.‚Äô

"You look...nice." Quinn finally said, not knowing what to really say, and two of them were soon seen walking off. When Helen met with Quinn, she expected more of a reaction from him, but something was off.

She couldn‚Äôt imagine what he had been through, even after seeing the videos, and they didn‚Äôt show everything that was going on either.

‚ÄôIs it because of my reaction from last time, is there really no way to fix this?‚Äô She wondered. It was crushing her a little inside to know this. Epically since one person had an advantage over her. The fact that she could be by his side through all of his struggles. That was sure to win her some brownie points.

Eventually, Quinn had arrived at the Daisy faction. The Shelter was unique. The outside on the walls itself were covered in vines, and there was plenty of greenery inside. While the exterior was full of fields with different coloured flowers.

Helen had given Quinn a schedule when he arrived as an announcement had already been made for everyone to gather at the centre. A stage was also busy being prepared, and he was chucked in the centre of things needing to get to work almost immediately.

Quinn was waiting on the floor grounds for the preparations to be complete. While Helen would give him a few more words of advice.

"We will try our best in the next week or so to visit the other planets. I have split the time up so we can visit four planets a day. Also with ample time for you to relax and get to know the Shelter and people together.

"We will use the teleporters as a one-off to travel between each of the locations as well. With the weapons you bought, Sam told us that you have roughly two hundred. We have decided that the best thing to do is for you to personally award them. We have gathered the top 11 or 12 fighters from each planet, where you can personally award them. Here is a list of their names." Helen handed out.

Seeing how well organised everything was, just because Quinn had planned to visit him was a surprise. What was even more mind boggling was he had no part in it. He didn‚Äôt ask people to do this, nor was he part of the hassle and trouble involved to make it like this.

This was because Quinn still had yet to realise just how much of an influential figure he was. This was the start of him learning about it more.

When the stage was ready, and the crowd of people had gathered. Helen was the first to go onto the stage. There were loud cheers, mostly coming from female voices since many of those at the Daisy Shelter were travellers and mainly female.

Soon after, Helen introduced Quinn to step on the stage as well. When he appeared, he could hear or whisper going around.

"He looks pretty human and handsome. I never knew he was so good looking in person."

"Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad getting my blood sucked by him."

"Helen told us that it‚Äôs because of him. There wasn‚Äôt much change to the Daisy faction. In fact, our lives have been a bit better as we share resources and don‚Äôt fight with the other factions as much as we used to."

It was strange, strange for Quinn to hear mostly positive things about him for once when coming to see a place. Looking over at Helen, he smiled at her for the first time since he had arrived.

"I know the struggle you all have been having on the front line. Hunting beasts every day for the sake of this war. You are an essential part of this Cursed faction, and you have continued to support and help all of us.

"Honestly, I don‚Äôt like using the word faction. For me, I prefer to use the word family. For me, it makes it, so our bond is stronger. I didn‚Äôt really have a family growing up, but the fact that there are so many people around who are willing to help fight for the family that I made... then in return, I will do the same. No matter what, I will support you." Quinn said.

At first, there was silence, it wasn‚Äôt because they thought what Quinn said was wrong but it just wasn‚Äôt what they were expecting. For a leader to come to them and say these things, they weren‚Äôt sure if cheering, a slow clap or what was appropriate.

When Helen started to clap and cheer, the rest followed, hearing his speech.

Next, it was time for Quinn to read out the names. In total, there were two men and ten girls who were to receive the blood weapons. However, their excitement dwindled when they laid their hands on the weapons.

They could tell that, unlike the beast equipment, although the weapons were strong, they didn‚Äôt infuse them with the same type of energy. Because of this, for those that received the awards, not everyone was exactly happy with them.

"What is this?" a person said, throwing the weapon on the floor. Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé
