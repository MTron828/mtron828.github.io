Ray was flying at a great speed toward Quinn, he just had his energy gathered in his fist and it was glowing a dark orange. There was nothing fancy about the attack, there was no large display of features, only Ray himself and his raw strength and power.

In some ways, that was frightening in itself, impressive that he was able to do such things, with next to no ability. People thought the Dalki were frightening due to this fact, so then what was this? This was a complete nightmare.

'I just have to break myself out of this nightmare!'

[A new skill has been unlocked]

[Asura's Blood Form]

Thanks to Alex awakening, it looked like a new active skill had appeared in the armour. The problem was, what exactly was this skill, without knowing basic information it would be hard to use it in a fight, and would it even be helpful in this situation? 

A cloud of smoke appeared, and running through the cloud were three Quinn's. All three of them gathered the blood aura heading straight for Ray, and threw their hands out. The winged dragon spun its body, going right through all three like a spear. 

When the clones were destroyed, more smoke had appeared, but Ray went right through it without any fear. He continued with his fists, throwing it out. The fist was stopped in its tracks and a large gust of wind followed from behind Ray.

Looking at his stopped fist, he could see that it had been grabbed, but not just by one hand, not by two hands, but four hands held onto Ray's and they didn't exactly look normal. There was the normal hand holding onto Ray that Quinn would use, covered in the special gauntlet that lit up in a golden colour. 

Then, Ray looked at the other hands, all of them, they looked nearly identical to Quinn's hands, but they were a solid Dark Red colour. They felt just as real and as solid as Quinn's other hands. It wasn't something that had just been made out of blood aura, this was something clearly different.

In total, Quinn stood there with his two real arms, and his four blood arms, this was Asura's blood form. Just like the Asura that Quinn had fought, Quinn himself was able to do the same, and the strength was not lacking in these arms compared to his real arms. 

"You are stronger than me, when it comes punch to punch, but its not exactly like I'm weak either, with a little bit of help, from the power of the armour, I can stop you!" 

Quinn lifted both his hands covered in the blood aura, and threw them out punching Ray. His body and his arms went flying back as a rush of blood aura went toward him. Ray was quick to shake of the hit, one that went to the body and the other to his face, but thats when he could see several other orbs of energy flying through the air.

All of them were around the size of fist. Seeing them, Ray went ahead and punched it with his own fist, it exploded on the spot, but not without some difficulty. He could feel the strength that was behind each of these attacks, and soon went to stop the next hit as well. 

This energy ball was slightly different in colour when it hit Ray's fist this time, but it felt different as well. These strange energy balls were coming one after the other and he was doing his best to hit them all away. There were more than he expected and it caused Ray to be at a standstill. 

He was unable to move, as all he could do was to hit these energy blasts away, he attempted to move to the right and to the left, but if he did he would get hit, and he could tell from the strength of the attacks that these would do at least some damage. 

As for where all these energy blasts were coming from, it was all from Quinn's new Asura's Blood form. With all six of his arms, Quinn was able to create blood energy from his fists that would be just as powerful as a strike at full force. 

He could even add his own power of Qi behind these attacks. With six arms he was sending out multiple fist waves of energy and that wasn't the only feature that the fists of energy had.

Just like the celestial gun, Quinn was able to produce different types of fists of energy. Making each arm specialise in one. It was like having the gun, but with more power in the attacks and he could fire off different bullets at the same time. 

Quinn wasn't really thinking, but he was just throwing out different types of fists, not caring about what was working and what wasn't… he was just giving it everything he had. 

'I can't stop moving my hands, I'll just keep attacking!'

Ray out of frustration decided to try something else, he allowed the fists of energy to hit him, they were clashing against his armour, and raising his hands he started to gather the power for the dragon sword attack. The aura surrounded his hands, and he threw it out straight to where Quinn was. 

Quinn jumped avoiding the large scale attack, it took out most of his fists of energy, but while moving, Quinn didn't stop moving his hands at a fast speed, firing out the energy blasts towards Ray, he did this again and again, moving, not stopping his legs or his arms when going from place to place. 

Then, it gave Quinn another idea, the shadow power wasn't completely unusable, just when he was right next to Ray it would take effect. Just using one of his free hands, Quinn started to create the shadow portals all over the battlefield, but did so a little further away from Ray so it wouldn't be affected by his armour.

Ray continued to take the hits head on, allowing them to hit him, marks were appearing on his face now, but he created another dragon sword with his fist and threw it toward Quinn. Before it reached him, he had hopped into one of the shadow's avoiding the attack. 

Jumping straight out of the portal, he was swinging all six of his arms continually, hitting Ray again and again.

'I will wear him down, I will continue to wear him down until he can no longer move!' Quinn thought.

Ray looked at where Quinn was with his head, and soon he could see that the attacks were coming from all sorts of different directions. Just like with the blood swipes from before, all of the fists were coming out of each of the portals one after the other. 

Unlike the blood swipes though, these had the force of Quinn's punch, and the special trait of each of the fists hitting Ray from all angles. This wasn't something that he could just withstand. 

Ray's body was chucking with each hit, from each side one after the other, he tried to hit some away, and he did a good job of blocking most of the attacks, but one would get through every once in a while. 

'This is so annoying!' Ray thought. 'If only… if only I was like the old me, and had my powers from before. I would have been able to deal with this guy! Am I really going to lose like this!'

The fist marks were unable to create a serious injury on Ray but the damage was building up. With the limitless armour effect as well, Quinn would continue, continue this until he took care of Ray. 

'If this is the only thing that will work, then I will do this to the end!'

On the sideline, there was one person that had been getting closer and closer to the fight, and he couldn't believe what he was seeing. 

'That damned person is losing! How… how is that possible!' Jim thought. 'I can't let this happen, I need to come up with something, I need to get rid of Quinn!'
