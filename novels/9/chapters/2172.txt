Majestic Desert Splendor

The Amra planets were many, but there was a difference from one compared to the other. The one where the strongest Amra warriors and leaders resided was now the only place that still had the tower.

A large structure that had been moved from its original place, rather than in the centre, it was now toward the back of the city, but it was still just as grand as it was before, allowing it to be seen from any angle and from anywhere within the city.

At the base of the tower, there had been a few changes compared to before, as businesses had moved close to the ground floor to maximise their profits. Forgers, weapon sellers, map sellers, and food stalls were all placed on the ground floor just outside of the tower.ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

There were still plenty of Amra who challenged the tower frequently and often those from the other planets would visit just to challenge the tower and see how far they could get. It was why business had flourished around the place like this.

A strange power still filled the tower and it worked the same way as before. There were ways a participant could leave the floor of the tower they were on by heading to a door. As long as the person had been to that floor before, they could teleport back to that floor.

Appearing at the bottom of the tower and exiting out of the door was none other than the leader Geo, but he wasn't alone as he had a group of humans following closely behind him. Some of them looked to be hurt and others were getting healed.

"Don't worry about the cost, all of you should eat what you want and rest up. Remember while you are here, everything is on me." Geo claimed.

Shiro turned around to look at the rest of the Blades, and he had his fist tensed up.

"We need to try again." Shiro said.

"Not until you are fully rested and have a plan." Geo stated. "I am in there with you to protect you, and I won't allow you to do foolish things, remember rest is important as well."

Shiro looked at Geo and his innocent smile was a disguise to hide his extreme strength. While climbing the tower floors there were many times, from beasts or from other Amra, where their group had faced a close call and Geo had saved them.

He was happy that when they initially met that they decided not to fight. It wasn't just Geo though, climbing the tower it made them see that there were plenty of Amra that were plenty strong.

"You managed to reach the fiftieth floor, that is no small achievement, not many could reach that far in the short amount of time that you have. I'll be honest, I didn't think you would get that far." Geo said, as he went to sit at an outside restaurant and order quite a bit of food for everyone.

The Blades were quite hungry and appreciated it.

The reason why Shiro was so annoyed was because it was now their third attempt at the fiftieth floor. They had hit a wall in their progress, but it felt like if they could get past the fiftieth floor, if they could break through this wall, then they too would all have a breakthrough in their power and skills.

All of the Blades, especially Shiro, had improved so much thanks to the tower. For the most part, they were all getting used to the gravity on the planet. It forced them to use the natural Qi in their bodies more to help them live every day life.

In the tower it was even more apparent because the higher floors also had higher levels of gravity that they needed to deal with. On top of that, Shiro had learned how to better use the others that were in the same body as him.

Vorden was the most skilled at Qi. He was a natural and it allowed him to combine Qi with certain abilities making him quite skilled. As usual, Raten was the best at hand to hand combat, and was the best at short range abilities that allowed this talent to shine.

Then there was Shiro, who was kind of a jack of all trades. At first, Shiro was quite a bit disheartened that he wasn't good at one thing in particular, but while going up the floors, he found that there were things that he could do that neither Vorden or Raten could. Which was why the three of them together were the perfect team.

Maybe not as much as when they were with Sil, but Sil was his own monster in that department.

Just as they were beginning to finish their meal. Another Amra had come rushing over to where Geo was. It was hard for the humans to tell each one of them apart, but this one looked more like Geo compared to the others, the rock skin was a different shade and more refined.

It was also clear that this person was in quite a high position, since when coming through all the stalls, all the guards bowed down and the people around.

"What is it, Dober?" Geo asked.

"Our space team has come into contact with an unknown spacecraft." Dober explained. "Due to what they said, we have allowed them to land, and currently they are currently staying at the manor."

"The manor?" Geo repeated. "Who would be in an unknown spacecraft, that you would allow them to stay in the manor?"

"Sir‚Ä¶ it's because they were humans." Dober answered. "At least some of them."

Those that were still eating had stopped, some had dropped their eating tools, and Shiro slammed his hand on the table as Raten had taken control for a second he was so excited.

"Wait there are humans, they could be here to get us, but how did they find out where we are‚Ä¶ maybe they are here to get rid of us?" Shiro thought, as he was going through a mix of emotions.

"If they are here to attack you, then we will protect you." Geo said. "Still, I think it would be best for us all to go see these humans together, and maybe you can ask them a few questions, it's very rare that we get visitors. Besides, they are with Nock which worries me a little bit."

In a large library, Layla and her group were patiently waiting. They had arrived with no trouble at all which was expected. They had heard from Quinn that this race also had a connection with him, and just like the Mermerials so far their trip had been pleasant.

That was until they had been placed in a room, with one of the Amra who had all of his arms folded and would constantly glare at them.

"Is there something wrong?" Ceril asked. "Why are you looking at us like that?"

"One human helped us out in the past." Nock answered. "But there are many of you. Just because one person is good, doesn't mean they are all good, so I can't trust you."

Layla thought that the Amra's words actually made sense, but she soon saw Russ step forward.

"You're right, we aren't all good, take me for example, I am a very bad person, and don't like it when people stare at me like you do." Russ stated.

He was in a strange mood, since he had absorbed two of the nest crystals on the way here, he wanted to try out his current strength, and these giant four armed aliens seemed like the perfect subject.

"Russ‚Ä¶" Layla said.

"I would also like to add that I am not human." Stark waved. "And I think that I am quite a good person."

"Purple man is good." Minny nooded.

The door behind bursted open, causing a distraction for the current scene, and they could see another four armed Amra take the lead.

"Alright let's see if these humans know each other." Geo said.

Shiro walked ahead with the rest behind him and stopped in his tracks, as he and Russ stared at each other.

"Russ‚Ä¶ I thought you were-"

"Dead?" Russ smiled. "No, I am very much alive, and what a surprise to see the Blades all the way out here."
