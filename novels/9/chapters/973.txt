Chapter 974 - Replacement teacher

As stated before, Quinn being in the position he was in, was free to leave as he wished. Even if he had classes to teach, such as the homeroom class and the beast weapons class, he just needed to inform them beforehand and that’s exactly what he did.

To his surprise, the person who would be taking his homeroom class was Hayley. Honestly, Quinn was quite happy with the choice, considering how well the class had reacted to her the last time she had taught. On top of this, he remembered the times when he was at school and would often have to come to the medical room.

Hayley never seemed like a bad person, and anyone who was a doctor for the students had to be a caring person, or at least he hoped so. Healers were highly sought after, and it would have been easy for her to get a position at any top faction. Perhaps she had other reasons as to why she had chosen to stay with the military, like her father being a Head general at the time. Still, she had even been there when Peter and Layla were injured and tried to help the best she could, but he didn’t know if that was just because she was actually Paul’s daughter.

As for the person who would be taking over the beast weapon class, Quinn didn’t know who that was as he didn’t recognise the name but thought it would be fine if it was only for a few days anyway. He didn’t plan to stay on the vampire planet for long, not after he had just come back.

It seemed like every time he returned, bad things would happen, so he didn’t exactly have the best of memories for the place.

It was the start of the day and while Hayley was fine with being a substitute she did wonder what General Hardy had that was so important that he needed to leave so suddenly. Currently, she was having a cup of coffee and was in the teacher’s lounge. A room where the teachers could rest and take a break. They had coffee machines, snacks, sofas and all sorts. Even a nice relaxing pod for one to take a quick power nap.

Inside the teacher’s lounge, Hayley wasn’t alone as she was talking to her work colleagues, Nathan, and Fay. The two other sergeants that were under Quinn and in the same group as each other.

"What’s wrong? Hayley, you have a concerned look on your face, are you a little nervous being a homeroom teacher after being a doctor for so long?" Fay asked.

She gave out a big sigh.

"It’s not that, it’s about the Earthborn generals. They seem to be quite arrogant and remember what I told you about what happened, well it seems like they still are planning to do something. I can’t believe they just openly were talking about it as if I wasn’t even there.

"These are our students as well, how are they meant to learn when the a.d.u.l.ts are secretly fighting and plotting behind their backs?"

It had been something that was on her mind since. The order of the military had changed quite a bit due to Oscar, and many were displeased with it. In the past, Hayley would have to obey completely to any of the head generals, regardless if they were part of a different military base. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

But she understood what Oscar wanted to show, that the military wasn’t a single force, the military was a group composed of all these groups that would share resources and forces. Of course, some didn’t like this and it was hard to get used to, but what kept them together was the idea that they still had Oscar at the very top.

After all, the other groups in the alliance had their own personal forces that were just as strong.

"From what you told me before, it seems like Hardy is no small fry in the Cursed faction. If he has that much power, then I wouldn’t worry too much about what they plan to do with him." Said Nathan. "Honestly, sometimes these people need to be filtered out of the system whether it’s through thier own stupid actions or someone playing their hand, it was the same with Duke, and I know how we all felt about him."

Taking on what Nathan said, she just hoped this whole thing didn’t get ugly, there had to be a reason why Oscar was letting things play out the way they were.

The homeroom class went on well for Hayley, obviously there were many in the class that asked ’Where did teacher Hardy go?’. But it was easy to explain since he was a Head general. They imagined he would be busy discussing deals, or even doing something with the military group rather than the school.

However, the beast class was a different story. For Quinn’s replacement they had grabbed a teacher from one of the other groups in the Earthborn who went by the name Aden. It wasn’t that he was a bad teacher, although the students still hadn’t found that out yet, it was the fact that he kept complaining about Hardy’s teaching methods.

"How could he just let you all try out any weapons you like?" Aden puffed. "You guys are only kids and hardly know much about our abilities and next to nothing about beast weapons. You, what’s your ability?"

"Erghh telekinesis?" Venus answered.

"With your type of ability a ranged beast weapon is best, or at least a projectile that you can throw. There are some users that have a dagger tied to a strong piece of string and use that in combat as well."

Aden carried on this way, going from student to student asking what their ability was and recommending a type of weapon or would outright hand them one. The students themselves were conflicted by this method.

Some of them were struggling with picking a beast weapon to use, after all, there were so many and they liked that someone told them what was best. While others didn’t like the fact that they had been shoved a weapon that they didn’t particularly want, even if it suited their ability.

It was two different styles that left the classroom divided, and there was one particular problem when it came to one student.

"And what ability do you have?" Aden asked.

Shiro looked around for a few seconds, he didn’t want to answer because he knew it would make him a target amongst others, but someone else who used to go to his school shouted out the answer for him,

"He doesn’t have any ability, sir!" A student shouted out.

The others who didn’t know about this started to gossip, as it was a rare sight and were wondering how he had gotten so far or his reasoning for not having one.

He was waiting for the teacher to say something, but rather than say anything, he just moved on, and Shiro could see the words he mouthed with his lips under his breath.

"Waste of time."

’Quinn, did you really go through all this as well?’ Shiro thought, as he was embarrassed and ignored as if he was just a piece of trash.

——

Using a teleporter at the school, Quinn was able to travel aboard the Cursed ship in nearly an instant. There was a quick hello to everyone as he walked past, but there was no time for idle chit chat as Quinn wanted to get this done as soon as possible.

From the Cursed ship, he would use the teleporter to head back to the vampire world. Although he would have to travel through two teleporters, it was better than having a teleporter at school that linked to the vampire world.

Once stepping through, he had finally appeared in the tenth castle directly into the new throne room. It was the normal dark colours that surrounded the large hall, with large stained glass windows overlooking the area. In front a red carpet laid out going all the way all to the arching doors. What did take Quinn by surprise, was that there were two people there to greet him. Paul for one, and the other was Kazz.

’Wow, Bryce really does like to work fast.’

"It’s nice to meet you again Quinn." Paul said. "Things have been going well here, I hope they have been so for you on the other side as well."

Walking away from the teleporter, he walked forward and Kazz started to follow.

"A few small problems here and there, but nothing I can’t handle, and by the way, your daughter is doing well. I hope you two can see each other soon."

Quinn soon left the room and his next destination was the fourteenth castle.

’I wonder what I will find there?’
