Due to the transformation that had taken place, and the energy that was swirling around the place, Calva had felt something. The energy had hit him as well, and the chains that were wrapped on his body were being weakened by the energy.

'This is my chance, I can do this now.' Calva thought. He wasn't going to waste this opportunity. White energy surrounded his body, and his arms started to whiten with the hard bone like substance. 

He pushed and pushed, and then breathing out when he felt there was a tiny bit of give, he exploded the force of energy he had from within. The chains broke off, falling to the floor and disappearing as if they were only made of aura.

Anon, along with the other Skullys at the time, were too busy looking at what was happening, and only noticed Calva breaking out at the last moment. 

"Hey, looks like the deal is off." Calva said with a smile. "However, as a favour." 

Calva, with his large hands, picked up two of the Skullys, and then went to pick up the third with his other hand. He started to run around to the edge of the camp at an incredibly fast speed around the place, and when reaching the walls of the camp, he leapt over them, landing in the forest. 

"If you stayed there, the three of you would have died." Calva said, as he placed the three of them in high trees and got himself in a better position to look outward toward the fight at hand. 

The other Skullys were cautious of Calva, even moving away, but they wouldn't run away. He wasn't attacking them nor did it feel like he was going to, instead he was watching the great spectacle that was about to begin, just like all of the others. 

——-

Two fully transformed demons stood apart from each other, but there was a difference between the two. Not just in appearance. The energy that was radiating off from the two of them was drastically different. 

There was a visible aura, thick red and uncontainable, which was coming off from Kronker's large body. If one got close to him, they would feel as if they would get killed just trying to touch his body alone, that was how powerful his form felt. 

Meanwhile, Quinn's current form, it felt as if there was nothing. There was no radiating power around him, yet for some reason, the smile that was constantly on his face was frightening. The fact that even when faced with this situation, he was smiling like so. 

'What is this… I can sense his energy, it is like us, it's like that of a demon.' Kronker thought. 'The initial powerful feeling I felt from before, I can't feel it now, it's almost as if it's disappeared.' 

Even though Kronker was in his demon form, he realised when looking at Quinn, he was slightly afraid for some reason. 

"Ha… Ha!" Kronker laughed. "This is your big play, this… this form of yours? You look just as puny as before. You are nothing like us demon kings!" 

The last few words were shouted out, and the energy from Kronker came out of his mouth, straight towards Quinn. The ground on the floor was disappearing from seemingly an invisible force, and when it reached Quinn, though, it did nothing but ruffle the shadow cloak he had on his body.

It wasn't an attack so Kronker expected Quinn to react this way, but the fact that he stood there not saying a word, not even reacting to the situation was getting to him. 

"I'll show you the difference between a demon king and you!" Sparks emerged from the top of his two horns as well as his mouth, and a ball of aura was starting to gather.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was growing larger and the red aura was growing darker in colour. Every time it would expand to a certain size, it would condense down, getting smaller, then growing bigger again, repeating the process again and again, as the ball was getting darker and darker. 

"Arghhh!" The red ball of aura left from Kronker, and went straight for Quinn. The small beam grew incredibly large, covering nearly the entire area of the camp. 

Would Quinn move, would he use his clones, would he use his shadow? No one quite knew what he would do, and they were unable to see what he did as the energy blast covered his entire body. They could only see a shadow of Quinn for a few moments as the energy continued to be blasted at where he once was. 

Kronker continued to press, pouring energy into his attack; it had already destroyed the back wall of the camp that was behind Quinn, and the energy blast was continuing further than the eye could see. 

Eventually the energy blast started to dwindle. 

"Hah… I thought as much, you couldn't even avoid my strike." Kronker said. 

It was true, Quinn hadn't avoided the strike, he had been directly hit by the demon blast.

"Hahahaha!" A deep laughter sounded out. It echoed through the skies somehow, and it was deep and dark, while being high pitched at the same time. It almost sounded like there were two voices, one that was deep and low, while another high and ear screeching. One slightly delayed after the other, creating a horrifying laugh that made one wish to cover their ears. 

"Hahahah!" The laughter continued, and with the beam of energy having disappeared. They could see Quinn standing there, still unharmed by the blast. I think you should take a look at

Calva, now having a clear look at his face, could tell. 

"He's not the same as before… that is not the same person… he's completely lost his mind."

He could tell from the look in his eyes that it wasn't the look of someone who was conscious of what they were doing, which worried Calva, because when one was unconscious and the mind wasn't making decisions then it meant something else had to be doing it for him. 

Was it his instincts, the raging power inside, and worse of all, what would the result of all of it be.

The dreaded laughing sound had finally stopped, it was dead silent. Everyone felt the hair on their body standing up, waiting for something to happen. 

Quinn swung both of his hands back swinging them to the side. For a simple swing, the dark red aura, mixed with an outline of purple, came shooting out from his hands. 

It wasn't an attack directed at anyone; he was just moving his hands back and a burst of energy exploded out to the ground behind him, creating a large formation of rocks as big as a mountain behind him. 

Kronker reacted, gathering another blast within his horn, not as condensed as the time before and fired away. Two orbs of energy were swirling in Quinn's hands. He threw them out and the dark energy smashed into the red energy. 

There wasn't a battle of power as Quinn's energy exploded in size on impact, it  had reached the skies consuming all of the demon energy and encasing even Kronker in it. It exploded and gusts of wind with piles of rocks were sent out in all directions. 

The large trees with branches as thick as tree trunks were struggling as some of their roots were being pulled from the ground. 

Eventually, out from the giant whirlwind of power, Kronker could be seen coming out from the side. His body had been hurt, his energy was still strong but his skin and more had been badly damaged, as well as a bit of blood trickling from his mouth. 

"Where is he?" Kronker said, no longer seeing Quinn in the same spot. 

To his side, flying in the air, with his wings leaving a trail of red blood aura in the air behind creating some type of barrier, Quinn was there looking at him with his smile and a single hand pointed out gathering the dark aura once more. 

The dark blast came out from Quinn's hand but Kronker was able to avoid it as he pushed off with his tentacles from his back while also blasting towards the ground on the floor giving him a shot of boost. 

'He's fast… is he faster than me, even in my current form?' Kronker thought. He had never seen someone so fast before, and as he said those words, Quinn had appeared right in front of him again. 

He swung his clawed arm that was covered in the dark shadow-like substance, Kronker in these types of situations would usually bulldoze himself forward and attack back. That was how he won his fights, with his sheer strength, but in this case it wasn't something he would do. 

Leaning back, the fingertips of Quinn had ripped right through the chest of Kronker. Blood splattered out from his chest and went flying in the air, while a black mark of shadows was left on Kronker's chest. 

That wasn't the end of the attack though, as the blood that had come out from Kronker didn't fall to the ground, instead it floated towards Quinn's mouth who opened wide and gathered his own energy, including the blood, to let out a deadly breath blast. 

At close range it smashed into Kronker and slammed him into the ground and the beam of blood energy continued.

Calva, the champion, was the only one that was just able to keep track of the fight, and he still didn't quite understand what was going on, but it was clear. This fight was a huge mismatch and any thought of him coming in and taking out the one left had left his mind.
