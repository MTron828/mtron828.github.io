Chapter 549 Special person

Nate started to rub his eyes, as he wondered if he was seeing clearly, but the same man was walking towards him. Now that Sam had mentioned it, on a closer inspection it really did look like the same person he had seen at the inter military base tournament. The student known as Quinn Talen.

Nate had actually seen a photo of him on the pre evolution forms handed by Blip, but the appearance change had thrown him off and he never thought about it until Sam had mentioned it. People often changed appearance slightly, especially when they were in their teens. It was when you would go through your biggest changes.

But this was something else, the last time he saw him he looked like a handsome young teeneager. Although not as handsome as Nate himself of course, but now it looked like he was looking at a young athlete. Changes happened, but this was a bit too much for only two months.

’He must have responded to all my messages I sent. He really did decide to come here.’ Nate thought with a smile. This fact along with him looking like Quinn, confirmed his thoughts.

"So you know this guy, Nate?" Blip asked. "Blood Evolver is a strange name to have, is he a strong one?"

Nate was quiet for a few seconds, before he started to laugh out loud hysterically. "Strong, he’s..he’s" But before he could say what he wanted to, Sam had placed his hand on top of his shoulder and leaned in by his ear.

"Maybe we should keep this to ourselves for now." Sam whispered. "Remember Blood Evolver was only well known between the students at the military base, he never played on the public servers. On top of that, he became popular because of his red aura skills, but remember at the tournament, Quinn showed his shadow skills under the name of Cursed child. The other’s don’t know his secret, and we’re probably the only people that have put both of these things together.

"We don’t know why he has two abilities, or maybe one of them is just his soul weapon making it look so different, but I am sure he’s keeping it a secret for a reason."

With those words said, Sam pulled back and went back to his position.

"You were saying." Linda asked?

Nate’s face went red, as he felt like he looked like a fool, suddenly getting excited and now he had to tone it down.

"Oh, err yes. This student I’m not sure. I think I have seen him before. I think maybe we should watch how they perform." Nate said as he said down quietly in his seat.

Sam hoped it was enough to fool the two of them, Nate wasn;t the best of liars.

His actions were strange the two of them thought. They hadn’t known Nate for long, but there was one thing both Blip and Linda did know about him. It was the fact that he was loud and not a shy person. They liked this honest side of him, and that was why they were fine with bringing him into the Crow’s faction and giving him high ranking responsibilities so quickly. They needed a person like that.

And for the first time, they had seen him act so awkward. It had to be because of one of the people who had walked in just now. The question was, which one.

’I wonder which power you will show.’ Nate started to think. ’If he showed the shadow, or the red aura, he would quickly rise through and be sought after by everyone. But I won’t let you over shadow me, Quinn. I will rise equally as quickly to the top.’

Nate decided to look at the tablet one last time, to see which ability he had put down, maybe he had missed something, but when looking at it, he was surprised once again. The ability that had been placed was neither the red aura or the shadow, it simply said super speed.

’Super...speed...what?’ It was clear Nate was completely confused at this point. He was starting to second guess himself, whether this was the Blood Evolver.

Scrolling down further, he then realised that Quinn was the one that had placed down he had killed the king tier beast. His doubts from earlier were gone. He didn’t know why he was hiding his abilities, but he was. Now he was more interested in how he would trick everyone into thinking he had a super speed ability.

The four of them lined up as directed by Blip in front of the three seats. They stood there with their hands behind their backs as they usually would if they were at school. All apart from Kazz that was, who had given a wave to each one of them as they made eye contact.

"Cute.." Linda said quietly.

Both Blip and Nate had heard that, and it seemed out of character for someone like her. They turned to look at her face, which was still straight and cold like it usually was.

’Maybe we were just imagining things.’ They both thought.

When Kazz and Nate locked eyes, she also gave him a wave, which he proceeded to wave back and give a smile.

’Does she like me?’ Nate thought.

Forgetting just seconds ago, she had done the same thing to the other two.

Quinn had seen both Nate and Sam, and when he did it was a relief to him. It was nice to know there would be some people here he knew. Since splitting off with everyone, he was feeling a little strange.

It started to remind him of the times when everyone was to gather at the base joking and talking about.

Sam had given a little nod to Quinn, acknowledging that the two of them knew each other and Quinn had given a nod back.

This was noticed by Linda who was sitting down.

Blip got out from his seat and was the one who would explain the rules of the assessment. He pressed a button on a controller in his hand, and suddenly inside the room several large blue light rings had lit up all over the place, apart from one which was a golden, not too far from where they were.

"The assessment will be a few tests where we will try to gauge you on a number of different things." Blip explained. "The first assessment is an obstacle course. There will be times when we are in jungles areas, mountains areas, and all other sorts of different terrains out in the field. The number one important thing to a traveller is their lives.

"There will be times where you will meet a beast that you cannot defeat or split off from your group and be alone. Here you will have to run for your life. Do everything you can to get away. This test is meant to emulate that.

"As you can see there are several rings, as soon as you go through the first golden ring, a timer will start. The gold ring will disappear and one of the other blue rings will turn gold. It should follow a path for you to see."

They looked at the rings and could see that they were all over the place. One of them was in the middle of a gap, suggesting you would have to jump from one container to the over to get through it. Others were in high places, making use of their upper body strength and climbing ability, lastly, there were a lot of rings.

It would also be a test of stamina for them all.

"The faster the time, the better the score. Now, who shall go first?"

Blip looked at all of them and then looked down at the tablet seeing their information. "I suppose the one with the super speed ability should go first. As you seem to have an advantage over the others.

"Usually, I would get one of us to complete the course for you to show you the path, that way everyone is on an even playing field. But I don’t think you have to worry about that. You should be able to complete it fairly quickly."

The observers moved off to the side and were behind the protector where Sam was standing. Here they would be able to see the time and everything Quinn was doing.

While seated, Linda took a glance at Nate’s face. One look would usually tell her everything. She could see he had a big grin that he couldn’t hide. This was the person that had made him act so strangely before, she knew it had to be.

’Did I hear Blood Evolver before? I think that was right... After this assessment, maybe I should go look up this person. See if I can find any information about them.’ Linda thought.

Quinn was in the starting position, standing right next to the golden ring. He would be lying if he didn’t say he was nervous. After all, he would have to complete and perform at a level where others would think he actually had a super speed ability.

But for some reason, he found the whole thing exciting, and even he wanted to test himself.

[Wind walk activated]

"Go!" Blip shouted.

Running through the first gold ring, the assessment had begun.
