Back in the vampire settlement, before the group had been called off to head into war, Ronkin was lining up with all the others. Apparently there were still a few last minute preparations for everyone as they needed to sort out grouping and more.

Because of all of that, the vampires were given a few more minutes with their families. For Ronkin, he didn't want to head back to his family, he had already said his goodbyes, and he didn't want those painful feelings to resurface, instead he thought that heading into the forest to do some hunting would be better for him to calm down.

There usually would be guards on the outside, but this time, even they had been called into battle. So it allowed Ronkin to head straight into the forest on his own.

While walking through the forest, he saw no beasts, but it did give him some time to be alone with his thoughts.

'Could I just run away from the battle right now?' Ronkin thought. 'Would they even know that I never went off with them? After all, I'm not an important figure, but then what would happen to my family if they found out.

'Maybe, I could run off with them? And live where, you idiot? Without a ship, I would just be stuck living among the beasts.'

Ronkin was too afraid to live out of the vampire settlement, too weak to try and break through and steal a ship in order to escape. In the end, he had no choice but to go through with the war.

After walking for a while, Ronkin had come across a river going through the forest. The area was pebbled and he could see a large rock on the side. Sitting on it, he placed both hands on the side of his face.

"I don't want to join this stupid war‚Ä¶ Quinn, maybe you were the one that did the right thing after all, getting away from all of this." Ronkin mumbled out loud.

At that moment, a gust of wind could be felt from behind that hit some of the pebbles into the water. Ronkin covered his face with the side of his arm to stop the dust from getting into his eyes.

The sound of something somewhat heavy was heard, and when he finally could take a look, he was staring at a large owl, with a long neck, and dark black eyes. It was a beast and not just any beast, it was one that would bring even vampires nightmares.

'This beast‚Ä¶ isn't it the same one that was described before! The one that caused so much trouble, but I thought it was dead!' Ronkin thought, wondering if he should run or hide.

Ronkin's memory had been wiped so he had no recollection of meeting the beast in the past.

As Ronkin stood his ground, for some reason, the beast wasn't hurting him, and just stood there.

"Is it true?" The owl finally spoke. "Is it true that you don't wish to take part in this war‚Ä¶ What is your reason for this?"

Of all things, a beast was asking him this question. At first Ronkin didn't want to answer, but there was a lot of pent up frustration to do with the war that was weighing on his mind. Since the beast didn't seem to be working with the vampires, Ronkin decided to answer.

"I don't believe the reason." Ronkin answered. "They keep pinning the blame on Quinn. Calling him some demon from another world.

"Yet, is he really a demon? He lived with us, he lived with his family quietly, not wanting to hurt anyone, and it was only when one of his friends was hurt because of this stupid war, that he decided to act out.

"He just did what anyone with his power and his position would have done, and now, we have to go planet to planet eliminating others, to try and find him and other demons. My son‚Ä¶ he was sick, incredibly sick, I thought it was thanks to Edvard that my son managed to get treatment to get better.

"But, Edvard never paid attention to me before, so why would he so suddenly care now, and from the looks of things, Edvard was somewhat involved with Quinn. It makes me think that the one behind the treatment‚Ä¶ was Quinn after all. Tell me, is that really the act of a demon? Becuase if you ask me, the things that we are doing are a lot more demon like."

Ronkin thought he had somewhat gone mad, talking to an Owl-like beast, maybe the beast and the voice he heard was just his own subconscious speaking. The thing was, he hadn't gone mad at all.

The beast in question was currently being controlled from one of the skills Quinn had, the shadow infect. From time to time, he would use it to be updated on the situation back in the settlement. To just use the shadow infect skill he would simply have to close his eyes.

So there were plenty of times for him to use it, when he was resting, healing, and all sorts. On top of that, there was one thing Quinn didn't want to do, and that was lose this fight no matter what.

Quinn would get his friends back, and change things back to the way they were no matter what, so he was going to use everything he could at his disposal.

"If you had the chance to help out Quinn, and stop this war, would you take that chance?" The Owl asked.

Clenching his fist and standing up straight, Ronkin gave his answer.

"Quinn reacted that way when Nell was hurt, if only we had listened to him about not joining the war the first time. If I was given a second chance to help him, and listen to him again, then of course I would take it!"

The owl smiled revealing razor sharp teeth that startled Ronkin for a second, as he thought he was going to be eaten, but instead out from the forest, vines started to move, and more beasts started to come out. Those that had been infected with the shadow.

It was almost as if the whole forest had been infected by the shadow, and standing with them was Jeouk.

"You gave a good answer. I think if the two of us work together, we can really help Quinn. It seems like there is a lot going on." Jeouk said.

‚Äî‚Äî

Back on the Amra planet the two of them were recalling the meeting they had that day, everything they talked about with the shadow beasts.

"We will be going up against the vampire leaders." Ronkin said, holding the staue of Quinn.

"Yes, but they won't know it's us, we will just be helping the Amra‚Ä¶ from the shadows." Jeouk stated.
