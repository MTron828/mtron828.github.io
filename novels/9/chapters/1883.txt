Chapter Ôªø1884 Make me the best (Part 2)

The group turned to Logan wondering what he meant and he soon to explained.

"My son, Jake Green. While all of you were busy on the Pure ship causing mayhem and a ruckus, I sent him off to gather a few Demon tier crystals." Logan explained. "It felt like a large battle was soon coming, a fight with Pure."

"What I didn't expect was for us to suddenly attack them before they even got the chance to attack us. I also thought Pure would stay quiet for a while, so it was the best chance for us to gather extra power."

"Jake is strong enough to fight Demon tier beasts on his own. Originally they were going to be used as weapons and handed out to our best, or you guys, but now they have a better use." Logan smiled.

They didn't know how long Jake would take, but it was a head start. With Logan's demon tier tracking device as well, as long as there was no trouble in killing the beasts, all would be well.

"Even if I do get all the materials, it will probably take me around a week or so to make the weapon for you. You will have to wait either way." Alex explained.

In this situation, Quinn felt a bit restless, because there was nothing he could do to speed up the process, everyone in the team was already moving.

"I still think it would be best if we search for Zero ahead of time, I doubt there would be much he could do in a week's time, but we can never be too sure," Chris explained.

"I think it's a good idea." Logan replied. "However, I think you should take someone with you. I think Peter would be a good choice. With the two of you, your strength will help even if you do happen to run into a fight with them.

"In the meantime, Quinn will wait for the weapon to be done. I would say to take a teleporter with you. However, I doubt it will have any effect with Agent 4 there as well. The only thing we can do is, once the weapons are complete, have Quinn come out to you as fast as possible."

Quinn didn't want to be split up from the group again. Not this time, but he was wondering if there was anything else. Alex knew the shadow so Quinn could get to him at any point and time, but getting to the others was harder.

The only forging equipment that was good enough for Alex to work on was in Green city as well, and Sil's teleport powers didn't work that far.

"I guess it's the only thing that could be done, but I would feel a lot safer if Sil was there as well," Quinn asked.

"What do you think? I'm not strong enough!" Peter shouted. "I kicked that Flora girl's arse already and I will slap Erin back to herself or to death if I meet her."

"I think you should trust Peter on this one," Sil said. "Everyone here has managed to survive without you Quinn, they went against Erin and survived. I honestly wouldn't worry about them.

"For me, the bigger threat is out there. I took some time off to help you Quinn, but I need to go back out there. I forgot a lot of what I saw before, but all these events happening now are making it come back to me. I can tell, it's soon."

Sil didn't want to worry the others with what he had seen with his vision, and after seeing Quinn's power there was no worry in his head that they would be fine without him.

"Sil, you have a really important task‚Ä¶ Everyone does. I think you should stick to your guns on this one."

After a lot of talking between the group, it seemed like many of them were ready to finally leave. Now knowing that Quinn was okay.

Lucia was worried about the state of the Graylash family. She wanted to head back and see how the vampires were doing there. She felt like she had already accomplished a lot and was no fool. She knew that with the next fights against Erin, Zero, Flora and Agent 4 she could do nothing.

Jessica had also decided to go ahead with her. With the dhampirs mostly destroyed and no longer feeling under threat, now she could enjoy her life as a Traveller which was something she always wanted to do. On top of that, she knew there was no longer a reason for her to stay by Quinn's side anymore.

Then there was also Muka, she still had no clue what had happened to the rest of the vampire chambers. According to Chris, they knew nothing about them, so it was unlikely that her answer was with Pure or the others so she needed to find out her own answers.

This left Ceril, Minny and Mitchell. There were quite a few conversations between them all as they said their goodbyes. Minny was crying her eyes out for losing her beautiful aunties, and asked them to come see her from time to time.

As well, everyone thanked Quinn. Not just for what he did now, but also for what he did back then in the Dalki war as well. They had learnt that Quinn had never been able to get the pleasure of being thanked like that, so they wanted to make it up to him.

Sil said he would help each of them by teleporting them to where they wanted to be, before he went off to do his own thing and now the place suddenly seemed a lot quieter than it usually did.Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

"It's‚Ä¶ been a rollercoaster of emotions, hasn't it Minny." Quinn said, sitting down and patting her head until she fell asleep on his lap.

Putting her to the side, Quinn gently placed her down allowing her to continue to sleep, and decided to head to a particular area along with Logan.

While waiting for the crystals and weapons to come, Quinn was going to use his own Celestial space to train again, getting as many hours in as he possibly could. There was a chance that he would have to take all four of them on.

With the weapons they had, even for him, Quinn could imagine it being a tough fight. All of these individuals were at the same level as Chris, or possibly higher. Meaning it would feel like taking on four god slayers at once.

Before that though, Quinn needed to see someone. Heading over to the large clear glass tube Quinn could see Vincent lying inside. His body was breathing but he seemed unconscious.

The nest crystal was in his chest and the energy was flowing through him slowly.

"Can you ask Jake to find a Nest crystal as well while he is out."

"Sure," Logan replied. "I mean, we are always looking for Nest crystals all the time anyway due to their use. Is there a reason?"

Quinn placed his hand on the glass chamber and now that he was closer he could feel the energy slowly entering Vincent's body. He was weak, like someone else he knew.

"A nest crystal's energy is almost limitless. I guess the correct thing to say is the energy is always restoring itself in the crystal. Which is why it can create so many beasts. However, if all of the energy is used up at once it will disappear."

Quinn had a lot of experience with Nest crystals along with Sil, and during that time it made him wonder.

"Vincent is weak like him‚Ä¶ there is someone else that deserves to be on this journey. This journey to take out Erin, with my celestial powers and a nest crystal I want to see‚Ä¶ I want to see if I can bring him along with me." Quinn explained.

"Who are you talking about?" Logan asked.

"My Blood Brother," Quinn replied.
