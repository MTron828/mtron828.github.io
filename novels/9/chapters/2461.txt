Sil didn't think he needed to demonstrate more than this, and he was sure that Pultra herself was probably hiding some of her own powers as well. In the first place, he would hate for her or himself to get badly hurt, and Sil needed to be ready at any moment to fight Immortui if need be.

Pultra was no longer fighting back, it looked like she had admitted her defeat. So Sil snapped his fingers again and all of them teleported right back to the tree where they were before.

Pultra had to look around her, and even rubbed the grass underneath with her feet a few times. As she lifted her foot, it started to grow slightly longer.

"This is real." She said. "The last place we were at was all real as well. It's not an illusion, and all of those other powers you had as well, they were all real? You are quite diverse aren't you?"

"I can do many things." Sil answered. "I'm confident in my own strength, but I've never gone against Immortui, but you have, we can talk about it later. Since I won that fight, will you come with us?" REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

Looking at the waterfall, and the golden temple that was placed at the top of it, she thought about it for a while.

"I would like to come with you." Pultra answered. "I'm still not sure even with your strength if we can beat Immortui and the demon kings. You caught my interest claiming that this person is stronger than even you.

"This person has even managed to bring hope into Calva, but from the way you are acting, I assume you are hiding from Immortui at this moment?"

Her guess was correct, and Sil's face said it all.

"Then I can't leave, if I do leave, then they will know I am gone, and that will ruin your whole plan. They check up on me frequently." Pultra explained. "A team of Yaks come to harvest the area regularly while planting new crops or new items, and at that time they also check up on me."

"I think I might be able to solve that problem." Sil brought out the book changing his abilities again.

He created a clone of himself, and after that, the clone's body started to change. It swirled and grew in height, creating different shapes and sizes until right in front of their eyes there was another version of Pultra right in front of her.

Amazed by it, Pultra walked towards it and even placed her hand on it, stroking the clone's cheek. She could feel it. It was real and wasn't an illusion.

"You have quite the godly powers." Pultra complimented.

"The clone will be in your place, it also is able to transmit messages to me through telepathy. If they come and question you, as long as you are next to me, I can ask you the questions instead and answer the way you would answer. They won't be able to tell the difference."

It was a solid plan that had even gotten Calva excited. They could use this to resolve the next issue as well with the next Champion. However, the look on Pultra's face still said that something was wrong.

"No, this will only fool them for so long." Pultra said. "When the greenery, the things they have placed in here aren't changing due to my absence, they will know I have left, but I think that will give us enough time."

There was a large smile on her face, and so it was decided. The clone of Pultra went ahead, sitting under the tree, and once everything was ready, all three of them would start to teleport.

Using his powers and having travelled quite a bit on the planet, it didn't take long for them to arrive back at the cave. It was a bit small and was getting more cramped as more people were now inside.

"Whoa!" Chris said, nearly jumping back, he was ready to transform until he saw Sil and the others.

"It's alright." Sil said.

"Ah, yeah don't worry we know." Edvard said. "It's a champion right? The others have caught us up with everything that's going on. So, I guess these two are the champions as well."

There was an awkward silence. The group didn't really know each other, and none of them were particularly the type to just get along with each other from the get go.

However, Sil did do something. With more people staying in one place, they needed to change the environment a bit more. Placing his hand on the ground, the area started to shift.

The cave grew wider, while also getting deeper. The entrance still stayed small, that way they wouldn't be found out by others, and now where they had been staying had somewhat become a tunnel that would lead to the large area they could reside in.

Sil had even created a rectangular platform that was raised up above the ground that Quinn could be placed on.

"Why didn't you do this before, we've been cramped up for no reason?" Russ complained.

"I thought, with your power, you could have done this as well?" Sil replied. "So, why didn't you think of this?"

Russ had to admit, Sil had got him there, and with nothing smart to say back, he decided to just stay silent and complain to himself under his breath elsewhere.

Pultra was the first to introduce herself to all the others. She didn't say much other than her name, after that Calva introduced himself as well to the other two that had yet to meet him.

"So, you two both fought against Immortui right, but you haven't gone against any of the demons?" Hikel asked.

"That is correct." Calva responded. "The demons were created after Immortui took over the place, and with them he ruled over the inhabitants, and planets just like this one. Although we know of the demon kings and have an idea of their strength, we can't help much with their powers."

"But you can learn from our mistakes." Pultra said. "I have heard that you are all strong, and for even thinking about doing something like this, I assume you are all a little crazy, but the two of us will share our knowledge with you, in order to help you against Immortui."

"Hey wait!" Peter said, standing up and walking forward. "That's not what's important. The one that needs to know about all of this stuff is Quinn. Quinn is the one that's going to kick Immortui's arse. We need the demon kings' blood!"

"Demon kings' blood?" Pultra was confused.

Calva went ahead and explained what Quinn's last request was, and also went into detail about how the demon power activating had affected Quinn as well. She had a feeling since seeing Hikel and Edvard, that they had some presence of demons in them as well.

"And where is Quinn then?" Pultra asked.

Moving to the side, Peter and the others allowed a clear view for her to look at Quinn, lying there in place.

"Do you know what is happening to him right now?" Peter asked. "Can we wake him up?"

"This is‚Ä¶ I have experienced this before myself." Pultra answered.
