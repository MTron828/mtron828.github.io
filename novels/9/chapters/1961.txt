1962 Zero's Rage

The words that had come out of Sabre's mouth, or more correctly Zero's mouth, made Oscar shake his head. He truly was going to listen to the man in front of him, try his best to comfort him, but these words were a direct threat, and that was why the people by the side all lifted their guns pointing them now at Zero.

"Wait!" Oscar lifted his hand. "Put down your guns. There are many that come here, angry, sad and in pain. We shouldn't just disregard it."

Looking at the sliced up gun and how the person was able to take one of the men hostage. Oscar guessed that this man was a talented fighter. Most likely someone who had taken part in the war and had survived just like him.

Sure, there were many people who threatened to kill the Supreme Commander, but not many that had the strength to and this person most likely had the strength.

"Why the grudge, why do you want to kill the commander?" Oscar asked.

"He… He forced my family to fight. He was the one that made the order, and never sent any help when we were under attack! We helped the world, but where was the world when we needed help!" Zero picked up his sword and directly pointed it at Oscar.

"Do you think you were the only one that suffered loss?" Oscar replied back. "Look around you, look at all these people here, who lost family members, lost everything they had.

"This may sound like an excuse, but if the planet you were attacked on was attacked by the Dalki, then probably over 10 other places were being attacked at the same time as well. We were trying to save everyone, everywhere making the best decisions when possible.

"Even I… in this war lost those close to me. We didn't ask for this war, no one did."

Oscar's words resonated with a lot of the people that were queuing up, and looking at the person to the left and right of them, some had missing limbs, or had hardly any clothes on at all.

On top of that, even the soldiers were thinner than some of the people in line, because they had been skipping meals in order to feed those around them, feeling guilty that they didn't do better.

"That makes sense in a world where everyone provides for each other." Zero replied. "But we never asked anything from the world. We lived on our own accord, provided food for ourselves, protected our own, never once asking anything of the government, or of the military.

"But then you forced us, my family, to help you! Then on top of it all, you stopped everything and signed a peace treaty with them, that is something I can not forgive."

Zero moved his blade slightly to his side, and it looked like he was about to make a strike. The soldiers by the side weren't so nervous because Zero was quite the distance away,  but there was a big worry in Oscar's mind.

This man in front of him reminded him very much of one of the Hero's of war, the Blind swordsman, and he had seen the things he was able to do.

Immediately, Oscar placed both hands on the ground, and pillars surrounded Zero like a prison, but with a swing of his blade, the pillars had been slashed in half and now he was running directly toward Oscar, at a speed that looked inhuman.

'My guess was right, he's the same, is there a relationship between the two?' Oscar thought. "None of you get involved, this is my fight! And bring me that!"

The soldiers listened to Oscar and a group of men ran back inside towards the tents, following his orders.

Lifting his hand, Oscar had made a wall of mud, and then out from that wall, solid bricks of earth were being shot out toward Zero.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing these, he started to hit them away, slicing them in the best motion possible, but one of the bricks had hit his thigh, hurting him quite a bit, but Zero continued onward, reinforcing his body with the first stage of Qi.

Rather than striking at the bricks he decided to run around the side instead, but like a turret, Oscar was moving the mound of mud, continuing to fire bricks out and once in a while, they would hit Zero, hurting him but not slowing him down.

'These bricks are coming out at a fast and heavy speed, just getting hit by one usually sends a person falling to the floor. This person is strong.' Oscar thought.

At the same time, Zero was struggling for a number of reasons, one of them being the fact that he had never gone against an ability user before. During the war he had fought just beasts and Dalki.

Sure there were times where he would see an ability user or two, but fighting against one was strange to say the least.

"How will I ever get my revenge, if I'm just running away all the time!" Instead of running around the side, Zero went straight forward moving his hand and slicing the bricks and allowing those to hit him in non-vital areas where he was reinforcing his body.

Eventually reaching the mound of dirt, Zero slashed it twice, cutting up an x shape, then seeing Oscar there, Zero thrust the sword forward, attempting to stab him right in the chest.

At the same time, Oscar had slammed his foot on the ground, and raised a pillar right underneath Zero's foot, creating a platform and raising him high in the air, making his sword hit nothing but the air.

"Crumble." Oscar said touching the earth pillar, and it started to break into tiny pieces. In doing so, Zero was now falling through the air, as he lost his footing. Spinning his body in the air, it looked like somehow Zero was able to slow his descent, making the fall not impact him.

However, Oscar had expected something like this from him. Which is why he had created two giant hands of earth, which were coming to gather for a large clap. The giant earth hands clapped, squashing Zero who was in the middle.

They had hit each other so hard that the earth they were made from started to crumble and fall to the ground, leaving a fallen Zero, to hit the muddy floor.

"Man, I wasn't expecting to see that. Oscar really had to use all his strength." One of the soldiers commented.

"Yeah, and he just showed why he is the best earth user that the military has."

"What about the other guy though, he was clearly strong as well. He said he took part in the war, right? Surely someone like him would have had their name spread and known."

The reason for that was because Zero had never been as flashy as Leo. Leo had taken part in the war, making an impact before the rest of them were forced to fight, and after that incident Leo had stayed in the military fighting the Dalki. As for Zero, he had gone into hiding, not wanting to take part in the war that took everyone away from him at all.

While lying in the mud, Zero's hands were still wrapped around the hilt of the sword, he never let go. Recirculating the Qi around his body, he was causing his cells to go into overdrive repairing what injuries he had.

Then stabbing the sword into the ground, Zero had gotten up once again.

"You're the one I have to beat right? If I beat you, I can get to the Supreme Commander. So I wont lose."

Summoning up all his strength, Zero threw out his sword, and tried to move his Qi with it, as he did a visible strike came out from his sword, making a Qi slash. This was unexpected for Oscar, who lifted an earth barrier but it had cut right through it, only slowing it down a little.

Using the earth he could find, he tried to create a type of armour, but the slash had still hit him, going through the armour, and cutting part of his chest but not killing him.

Oscar, was on one knee, and looked at the man in front of him, the look in his eyes, it was still there, not for a second had the fight been over.

'This man is dangerous, if I don't get rid of him here, he could be a problem for the whole world in the future.'

Just then the men from inside the army camp had returned, and as they did, they were carrying a bag in their hand. Placing it on the floor they opened it up and a large grand sword with three circles was seen inside, it was the demon tier weapon.

'For the sake of the world, I must get rid of you here. I hope you will find peace in your death.'
