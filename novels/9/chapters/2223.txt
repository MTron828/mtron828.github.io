The pods continued to rain from the Marpo Cruise one after another, and as they all hit the city floor, it almost felt like an earthquake was taking place. The Amra on the planet looked at this.

Their heavy, steady legs hardly moved due to the shaking; they had good balance and strength. Instead of looking at what was coming to them in fear, they were building up their determination to fight again.

They were injured, they were hurt, and fewer in number, but the Amra were strong, and to them, this felt similar to the trials in the tower.

"We will pass this!" Geo shouted to them all. "We will protect our home and get through this, and when we do, we will come out of it stronger than ever. A new world, a new life that we can't even imagine will be at the end of this fight!"

Hearing Geo's words, the rest of the Amra cheered throughout the city from their location. It started off like a wave, starting from the center and spreading through all areas.

"Please tell me... what is it that we need to worry about?" Geo asked, with Ronkin and Jeouk by his side.

They had been a big help with the demon-tier shadow beasts, and Geo had recognized them as part of their elite forces. Nock was also included in this. With those four, they needed to maneuver around the battlefield to give them a chance.

"This level of attack hasn't happened before," Jeouk stated. "From the look of the pods, every Vampire and Dalki under Jim's proposal has joined the battle now. This is the final wave; there will be no more after this."

These words, in a way, gave Geo hope. If it was just one more battle they had to push themselves through, then he believed they could do it.

"The one Quinn is worried about, the one he is building his armor for, does that mean he will be among these as well?" Geo asked.

"I'm not too sure," Jeouk replied. "I have taken part in the battles that were on the other planets, but other than the planet where the Namricks were, I have never seen this person. I only know of his existence through rumors."

At the time, when Ray and Quinn fought, the broadcast of the battle had come to an end. So they didn't know the strength of Ray.

"If he hasn't come before, then it might be a reason why he won't come, so he might not be among the others," Ronkin added, trying to keep morale high, but could see from the look on Jeouk's face that something was bothering him.

"There are two, though, that will be here... two that we need to worry about." ----

A reinforcement of around 6,000 more black pods had hit the city, adding to their already high number of forces. This time, there were more Dalki, Dalki that listened to Jim more so than Jack.

In the middle of all the pods landing, a sharp pointed base ship focused on speed was in between them as well. Rather than crashing into the land, it elegantly landed on the outside. The ramp descended onto the floor, and three in total emerged.

"It seems like the sayings that have stood the test of times are true," Jim claimed as he held his hands by the side and grabbed the air. "If you want something done, then you are going to have to do it yourself."

By Jim's side were his two guards, two people that were absolutely loyal to him, due to everything they had been through together. After walking a short while, the nine Original leaders each came one after the other.

They looked like files as they quickly formed a line and bowed down in front of Jim, though it was only a small bow. After all, the original leaders were the vampires who had started the settlement in the first place. Jim, on the other hand, was simply a hero among the vampires, having gotten rid of many troubles during their slumber.

'It looks like Ray is not by his side,' Hikel noticed.

"The war will end tonight, before the sun rises again!" Jim shouted. "After this battle, the performance of each of you will be evaluated, and we might need some serious reeducation."

Looking at the ground, Magnus scorned at Jim but didn't show it. He didn't like being treated this way, especially by someone who seemed to never do things himself, apart from sneaky attacks from time to time.

"What was that look you just gave me, Magnus?" Jim said.

Without realizing it, when Magnus lifted his head, his disdain was still showing. "Do you have a problem?"

Magnus had already been caught by what had happened, so he felt like he might as well say what was on his mind. "Why do you stay here and act like yourself when most of the time, you're hiding behind those friends of yours? You talk about the advancement of the vampire race, and yet, you're always hiding behind those who aren't even vampires--a subclass and a hybrid werewolf."

Jim smirked and moved away from his two guards, gesturing for them to stay in place. He was wearing light armor over his body, mostly for ease of use, but it was specially made from beasts. What tier it was or what power it held, they weren't quite sure. Usually, he would have a dark overcoat covering the light armor on his body. Taking off this overcoat, he allowed it to fall to the floor.

Surprisingly, he had armor that looked almost like a bulletproof vest underneath, revealing his arms to everyone at that moment.

The original leaders looked on in confusion at what they could see on display.

'What is that in his arms? Are they body enhancements?' Hikel thought.

In both of Jim's arms, from the palm all the way up to the shoulder, there were small, rock-sized crystals. Part of the outer shell of them could be seen sticking out through his skin. It was hard to guess their number, but possibly from just looking, there had to be at least fifteen of them in each arm, and who knew what was under the rest of his body.

"What are you? Are you even a vampire?" Magnus asked.

"I am a vampire," Jim answered with his eyes glowing red. "A true vampire above all else cares about one thing, and that is power, correct? As long as one has power, they have the right to dictate what others do. This has always been the case, not just for vampires but humans too. The strong decide what is right and wrong. The strong influence the way people think and act!"

The crystals on Jim's body started to glow, and Jim vanished in front of all the other leaders. Suddenly, Magnus could feel someone grab the back of his neck and pull him down to the ground.Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

Jim's foot quickly landed on top of Magnus's chest and stayed there. Magnus tried to push it off, but the foot wouldn't budge. There was a huge difference in power between them.

'It's taken me a while to figure out how these Nest Crystals work, but day by day, I'm able to draw out more of their power,' Jim thought, looking at the scene in front of him. 'I haven't even used the tier ten Dalki blood, and I'm strong enough to overpower an Original now.'

"So let me ask you a question, do you think I'm strong?" Jim asked with a smile.

The others standing by were barely able to keep up with Jim's speed, and they could feel a power emanating from him. It didn't feel like that of a vampire; it was an unusual power that seemed to be coming from the crystals on his body.

The crystals were something that the originals hadn't seen before, at least not during their time.

'Just what are those crystals?' Hikel wondered.
