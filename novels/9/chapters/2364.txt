Chapter 2365 ¬†Search for the ultimate team (Part 4)

In one of the castles in the vampire settlement, things were coming together, and all of those that would be part of the special team were being brought together to one place.

Muka had a large smile on her face as she had received information from each group, but it wasn't all good news, as there was one group in particular that had failed to locate one of those that they needed.

'Ray, we knew there was a chance that we wouldn't be able to get everyone that we were hoping for.' Muka thought. 'But he must have a good reason, it seems he has been helping us in his own way, destroying all the facilities and remnants of Jim.

'That is a problem that we just don't want to have on our hands. Besides, there was also an unexpected one that had agreed to join us.'

At any moment now, all of the guests were to arrive at the castle, to discuss the final details before trying to head off into the other world.

"Don't look to nervous." Layla said, as she placed her hand on Muka's shoulder. "I know why you're worried, but I should be the one that really is worrying, and even though I won't be going on this trip, for some reason, I still feel like everything is going to be alright.

"Maybe it's because I've been in this situation multiple times now, and I've always over worried."

Muka smiled back, feeling bad that the one that had to comfort her in all of this was Layla, and although what she said was true, the problem wasn't just whether they would succeed or not, but how much loss would come out of this.

They had always lost those close to them during these big battles, when sending the others off, they had to go with the intention that possibly none of them could be coming back.

A large overwhelming sense of power was felt by the two of them, they could feel it, everyone had arrived and they were heading straight into the castle.

The first two that were in the large bottom reception hall were Hikel and Edvard. The two of them had been staying in the castle for a while now. Ever since they had asked Muka to join.

The next to enter was Sil, who had teleported into the reception room rather than walk in which startled both of the original leaders.

"It is nice to see the both of you again." Sil said. "Although you look different from the last time I saw you."

Everyone had already met each other after the great battle, there was a ceremony for those that had died, as well as celebrations, so they all had gotten to know each other at some point before going off to do their own thing.

There was a clear reason for Sil's comments though, the armour that Edvard wore, he never saw anything like it.

"Is that‚Ä¶ a type of god slayer armour?" Sil asked.

Edvard smiled with pride as he pushed his chest forward showing the deep scales of the armour.

"Actually, this armour belonged to Ray Talen. Honestly, I don't know how it ended up back at my armoury, it seems like he must have returned it at some point. No one even knew he was here.

"Although I can't draw out the same strength as Ray, I have used the amrour before, and I have no doubt that I won't get left behind compared to the rest of you. Besides, my luck might be what ends up helping us all out in the end, with the place we're going to."

All of them, including Sil had been made aware of the details before coming here. They knew the risks. Sil had also heard about how strong the armour was on Ray. He had heard about the battle straight from Quinn's mouth that he had been through.

Although, it was hard to tell how much power was because of the armour and how much was because of Ray himself. Sil's head then turned to Hikel, because out of the two, it was his appearance that had more of a shocking change.

The clothes Hikel wore on his body itself were now dramatically different compared to before. There was next to nothing covering his arms and legs. It almost looked like he had a tattered robe covering his body.

Through the bare skin that was revealed, strange large curling dark red patterns could be seen across his skin. They were on the outside swirling around his arms, legs, and even a large mark swirled up on half of his face.

It was clear that this wasn't the same Hikel as before.

"I see you have changed quite a bit as well." Sil asked.

Hikel looked at Sil, and soon a smile appread on his face.

"Do not worry, although my appearance has changed a lot, I have not myself. This is merely a side effect of a successful experiment. I am glad to have you by our side on this journey. With your strength, I am sure we will be successful, and as Edvard said, I did this because I wish to help and do not wish to slow you down."

Before any of the others arrived, Layla, Muka, and Peter had rushed down, coming through the double doors from behind. They had entered the large dark reception room before the others were there.

"Thank you for coming Sil, I know you must have been settling in with your own life, and then to call you so soon." Layla said.

"Are you crazy, how many times has Quinn helped us all, and I'm sure right now he is doing everything for the sake of all of us once again." Sil replied. "Besides, if it weren't for you guys, I would still be trapped in the same place as before."

"He's right." A deep voice said from behind, and with no shirt on the top half of his body, they could see a red haired figure with scars all over his body enter the room.

"Layla, there is no need for you to say anything like that." Chris stated. "Besides, we know this is not just for Quinn, but for everyone. We know what Immortui is capable of, and we need to stop him once and for all.

"I just hate the fact that Quinn went in on his own, rather than asking us beforehand."

Chris was also surprised by the appearance of the two originals that were there in front of him.

"I guess we all feel the same way to an extent." Chris said.

"Agreed." Muka said, stepping forward into the centre of the group. "As we have looked into things more and more, Immortui seems to be the centre of nearly all conflicts, Logan has even found traces of his meddling dating back even longer than we can envision.

"I want to make this clear to everyone, this isn't a group that was created to bring Quinn back. Because at the end of the day, if we were to use the Boneclaw to just grab Quinn and bring him back, it wouldn't solve anything.

"There was a reason why Quinn had decided to go to the other world, and that is to stop Immortui once and for all. Your goal is to support him in this task, which is why we have gathered all of you."

Sil was thinking back to all the people that he had lost. There were many allies from the Cursed faction that he had lost on the way. All of those from the Blades as well.

All of that anger was originally pointed at Hilston, and now he wanted to point it at a new target while helping out his dear friend.

'I know Vorden and Raten would have wanted to be here to help us well, but this is not a task for them.' Sil thought.

"So is this it?" Chris asked. "Is this everyone that is coming."

"Not quite." Muka replied. "Ray was meant to be part of the group, but we are unable to contact him, but there is one more that will be joining us."

Footsteps were heard entering the room, and at that moment they all turned around.

"As they say, the hero arrives at the last moment." Russ smiled. "Now, I hope we haven't forgotten about our deal, right?"
