Reno had been waiting months for this moment, he had been especially courting one of the girls of his dreams while batting away all of the other flies that were after her like she was a pile of dung, and finally here he was. 

The woman, Yan, was in his room, sitting on his bed. Reno carefully ran his hands on her thigh a few times, as he brought his face close to hers. He could feel the heat of her breath through her nose on his upper lip. 

He couldn't take it any more and grabbed her, swinging her body around, and pushing her onto the bed. 

"I… I can't believe I'm finally here." Reno said, as he started kissing her neck gently bit by bit. 

"Yeah, me t— WHAT THE!" Yan quickly pushed the vampire off from her, with her great strength, she had forced him to crash into the wall on the side leaving a mark. 

"What did I do?" Reno groaned.

Yan pointed toward the window in the room. 

"It was there… I saw it, there was a little boy!"

Reno looked out of the window but was unable to see anything, just in case he rushed to the window and pulled it up. Sticking his head out he looked left and right but was unable to see anything. 

Turning around, Reno smiled. 

"It's okay, there's nothing there, it must have just been in your imagination."

Yan's hand was pointing, it was shaking as she could see it again, the little boy staring at them. Lifting up the bed sheet, she ran off towards the door. 

"I can't do this with a little boy watching!" She screamed, running out from the door. 

Out of frustration, Reno went to the window once again and looked out but was unable to see anything. 

"Man… did she go crazy or something?"

On the rooftop of the house next to it, on a three story building, a shadow portal had appeared, and out of it a little black haired boy came out. Galen Talen, laid on the rough tiles as he looked up at the sky. 

He giggled to himself, and a cheeky smirk appeared on his face. Once again, he had escaped from his mother's watch, and now was playing pranks all over the place. Now he was planning what to do next.

At home, Layla let out a big sigh, as she entered Galen's room and saw no one there. 

'That kid, when his father gets home, he's going to have to have a serious word with him.' Layla shook her fist in the air. She would do it herself, but with the shadow powers, he could just hide in his shadow space. 

She wished she had the sword to stop him from using his powers, and then she would at least be able to hold him to give him a good telling off. 

'I'm dreading what it's going to be like when he becomes a teenager… Come on Quinn, you have to come back. You're not going to make me become a single parent are you?' Layla thought. 

Leaving the room, she soon had been sent a message. It was through another vampire using telepathy. 

'Oh… I wonder why she wants to meet me?' Layla thought.

Back at school, lunch had ended for the children, and they were back in their classrooms. Here Miss Bedford seemed to have an announcement to make to the others, as she cleared her throat. A habit of hers when it was something a little more important.

"Alright children, I know we have been through a lot." Miss Bedford said. "And with recent events we haven't had the chance to enjoy ceremonies and such. Today, I am here to talk to you about an upcoming ceremony… a first for Roland Academy! We will be doing a joint venture with our fellow vampires!"

Miss Bedford expected a bunch of cheers, but since it was a first, naturally none of the children had any idea what she was talking about. 

Clearing her throat again, she started to explain. 

"The Vampire settlement has decided to host something similar to that of a sports day that humans have. Only that it will be based more around your own vampire abilities! 

"But as you know, any sports day is fueled by competition, and that's where it becomes important for all of you. You see, we will be competing against two other vampire groups. The Vampire Corps unit and the Graylash unit!"

The vampire academy on the settlement wasn't the only place where vampires went to school. The Vampire Corps that were spread across the planets surrounding earth, had families. 

They often put their kids in mixed schools, or schools exclusively for vampires, due to the less trouble that was involved. This was true for vampires that lived on the Graylash planets as well. 

The vampires in both of these areas had created communities. The Vampire settlement often felt apart from these groups but at the end of the day they were all vampires. Which was why the event was suggested by Andy, leader of the Vampire Corps, and also a man named Unny, who was the leader of the vampire community on the Graylash planets.

Muka was the one that had received the call in the end, and honestly with everything happening, she wasn't so sure it was a good idea. In the end, she had accepted but on one condition that it was to take part in the Vampire settlement. That way they could protect themselves a lot more. 

They could also prepare for any surprises that might come up. 

"Alright!" Miss Bedford clapped her hands together. "What we need to do is select special children for the events that will be coming up. We want the very best representing us for this competition. To prove that our school and our teachers are the best!"

There was a fire that was lit up in Miss Bedford's eyes and she seemed far more excited about this than anyone else.  Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

At the main castle, Layla had entered the office of Muka. She was sitting by her desk, and by her side there was Xander working hard away. The two of them had quickly jelled, taking part in work, and for a moment, she thought the two of them looked quite cute next to each other. 

'I wonder… if Xander has gotten over me. It would be good if he could find someone else, he was good with Minny, and Muka is a beauty as well.' Layla thought. 

"Ah, you're here." Muka said. "I wanted to tell you this in person rather than over telepathy, but something has come up." 

A raised eyebrow appeared from Layla. 

"It's the Mermerials." Muka replied. "They are coming for a visit. They didn't want to take no for an answer. I tried my best, but nothing worked, you used to live with them so there might be a few that you know. 

"Since Quinn isn't here either, you might need to do a bit of peacemaking between the two of us."

Once again, Layla let out a big sigh. It was a pain living this life of politics, but it was something she had to do. Besides, the Mermerials were good people, there shouldn't be any problems with them coming to pay a visit.
