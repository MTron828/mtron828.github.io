The eyes of the Yaks immediately turned to the noise and they stood up from their positions. They had been informed to be on high alert from their demon king, just in case a certain Champion had decided to escape. 

However, what they saw was no champion, and instead it was a lone single person standing there. 

"Huh, how did they manage to get on this planet, that would have been impossible without alerting us." The Yak said. 

At that moment, dropping down from the tree, with a fist full of energy, Edvard delivered a single punch. It landed right at the back of the Yak's head, creating a large hole killing it on the spot. 

"We need to get rid of them all, as quickly as possible, without making a lot of noise!" Edvard stated. 

The one thing they needed to do was not get caught, and now that they had been found out, the only other thing they could do was get rid of the evidence before it told on them.

Chris understood the assignment, as he was running toward one of them, he was already transforming into his full werewolf form, his skin was turning red and he leapt up off the ground. 

The Yak tried to hit the werewolf, but its acceleration in speed caused it to hit nothing but the air, as Chris used his claws to rip right at the demon's throat. Using the body of another, Chris jumped, pouncing onto the other nearby Yak and slashing at its throat as well, and then quickly went to the next. 

Worried that their falling bodies would create a large amount of sound when they fell to the floor. Edvard quickly moved, holding the bodies up and then gently letting them down. 

Chris was dealing with the Yak quickly, causing Edvard to go from one to the next, until they had eventually dealt with all five of them.

Chris ended his transformation, landing on the ground, and Edvard wiped the sweat from his head. It was a tense situation. 

"We work well together." Chris said. 

Edvard didn't comment at that, and instead looked at the situation in front of them. 

"You said they wouldn't notice one, but what about a whole team of five, I think they would notice that. Come on, let's try to move these guys deeper into the forest, so no one finds them." 

Although the Yak's bodies were large, the two had great strength allowing them to lift them with ease. What was more of a problem was their large limbs and having to navigate them through the forest. 

In the end, they had to slice off their arms, and pile it on the body for easier movement. Once Edvard felt they were safe enough in the forest and deep enough, Edvard placed them in a pile on the ground.

It was one of the wide open areas that didn't have large trees too close to it. He then could see Chris coming over with the last body, and putting it with the others.

"Do you care to explain what all of that was about back there, then?" Edvard asked. 

"What do you mean? Did I do something wrong?" Chris said. For a split second his pupils looked in a different direction as he broke eye contact.

"Are you trying to play stupid?" Edvard almost yelled. "I saw what you did, you put your Qi into that branch when you landed on it. You broke that branch on purpose as if you wanted to get caught!"Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

"Ever since we saw the Yak, you have been trying to convince me that we need to take them on. Is this some type of ego trip, did you need to prove that you were stronger than them?"

"Well, you did it, you're stronger than them, but now there is a good chance that once they find those Yak are missing, that they will start to be on the lookout for us."

All of it came out at once. Usually Chris was relatively mature, especially compared to the others. Which was part of the reason why he was angry. How did it come to this? 

A sulking look came about on Chris' face at that moment. 

"I'm sorry… you're right, you're a hundred percent right." Chris said. "The truth is, I was just thinking about myself, but it's not what you think." 

Chris then leapt from his position and landed on top of the Yak's body. 

"If we want to get rid of the evidence, it's best if we get rid of the bodies, right?" Chris said. "You heard them say how overworked they were, if they're missing some might think they've just ran away. So I'll make sure, they can't find the bodies." 

"How are you going to do that? If you burn them, then it will attract attention as well." Edvard replied. 

"It's about what I said earlier. I was being selfish, after I met that demon Unzoku, he said the way we werewolves get stronger is by eating. I never wanted to hurt someone again, and the thought of doing that sickened me."

"But when I saw the demons, saw their large bodies and great strength, it made me think. It would be alright to eat them right? These are the ones ruining the lives of others. They are our enemy and need to be killed if we're spotted."

"If they are dead anyways, then we might as well not waste their body." 

Lifting up a large piece of one of the Yak's arms, Chris transformed his head and took a large chunk of it, biting it, and swallowing it whole. 

Edvard couldn't quite believe it, but he remembered seeing sights like this in the past. Werewolves with a bottomless pit of a stomach, eating down anything. 

Edvard stood there, somewhat keeping watch, somewhat staring at Chris,  reminded of the old days. He wanted Chris to continue to eat all the bodies of the Yak. All of it going somewhere in his small body. He even consumed the bones of the thing. 

After consuming the first one, Chris could already feel it. The food was almost being converted into raw power, adding to his body instantly. He continued to consume one after another. 

'This is it… this is it… I've finally found it, the way to increase my strength.' Chris thought. 'If I continue like this, I'll be able to get stronger, I can help Quinn and the next time I meet Unzoku, it will be a different match altogether.' 

All five of the Yak were consumed, and although Chris felt far stronger than he was before, there was a certain look in his eyes, a look Edvard had seen multiple times in the past. 

'I know that look.' Edvard thought. 'That wasn't enough, you need to feast on more to grow your power… please Chris, don't become like the werewolves of the past, or I might have to have my hand in getting rid of you as well.'
