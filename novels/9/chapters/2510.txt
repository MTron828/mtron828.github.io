Chapter 2511 ¬†Two demon's kings against Chris

Two Demon Kings were now in front of Chris. He had just been using his newfound strength, testing the waters with his powers against Unzoku, and things seemed to be working. But now, having to deal with two of them and being on his own, even he knew that it was quite an impossible task.

'How do I get out of this situation, and who do I take out first? Who should I focus my attacks on?' Chris thought.

In the middle of his thoughts, he could see that Tenbris had stretched out his arms, and in doing so, two vortexes of blue energy whirled and went toward him. Jumping and flipping backward in the air, Chris managed to avoid the attack again.

The moment he landed, another vortex hit him from behind. He had turned at the last moment, blocking the attack and pushing against it. The muscles in his legs and arms were straining as he continued to push against the attack.

The blue energy was swirling, and something strange was occurring as he made contact with the attack itself.

'My arms, they feel incredibly heavy? Is my energy going away? Is this attack draining my energy?' Chris thought, until his feet started to sink into the ground itself. He wasn't losing energy, but the attack was making him several times heavier as it touched him, including his arms.

"Arghh!" Chris screamed as he unleashed energy out of his claws, giving a large push against the attack. It dispersed into the air, and the heavy feeling in his arms disappeared, but the fatigue remained.

The energy used and the stamina in taking on the attack were still felt in his body. 'I have to avoid getting touched by his attack. If I keep blocking them like that, then I'll tire out in no time.'

In the middle of these thoughts, several blue vortexes had come straight at Chris. Swirls of energy not just from Tenbris' hands but also from his wings as he flapped them. With how many attacks were coming his way, he had no choice but to change back to his wolf form. VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

In this form, he could run in a circle around the area they were fighting in. If there was one thing he was confident about, it was the fact that he could outrun the attack that was being used.

What was concerning him, though, was the lack of urgency on Tenbris' face.

"You should have used that opportunity to get rid of him, you mutt!" Tenbris said to his partner. "Why didn't you attack when you had the chance? Now this whole thing is going to take a lot longer because of you. I thought you were meant to be fast."

"And I thought you were meant to be strong," Unzoku replied. The wound that had been made on his arm was starting to heal up. "Why didn't you finish him off yourself?"

Unzoku pointed his hand, and he had it held out a little ahead of where Chris was. With him avoiding the blue swirls, he could see what Tenbris was doing. Although his attacks might have seemed random, he was attacking in a certain way so Chris would have to avoid them by only moving in certain directions.

It was clever because now Unzoku knew exactly where to attack and at what time to successfully land a hit, and the opponent had no clue whatsoever.

'This is extremely frustrating!' Chris thought to himself. All of his focus and energy after taking the first attack was now going on avoiding Tenbris' attack. If he wasn't exerting energy from blocking the attack, he now was running away from it.

He also had to be careful of what Unzoku was doing, at any point in time, yet Unzoku continued to do nothing.

Unlike the other demons, Unzoku didn't really have a demon form. He would just fully transform into his werewolf self, grow larger and bigger, changing his shape slightly, but it wasn't a drastic change like the others had.

For him, when the fight had started, he hadn't been holding back against Chris. The two were going head to head with everything they had, which just went to show how much the other had improved.

'He got that strong from eating another Demon King?' Unzoku thought.

"You stupid mutt, if you really aren't going to do anything, then I guess I will have to deal with it myself!" Tenbris flapped his wings again, and this time out from them were dark-coloured feathers.

They flew through the air at high speed, covered by the dark blue aura, looking the same as the attacks that had come before. Chris had moved, avoiding the tornado of power, but now he was heading right for the feathers.

"Two on one is a little unfair, don't you think!"

From right in front of Chris, three figures landed. One swung his axe down, blasting the feathers away with dark flames. Another with their foot had slashed the feathers away, and lastly, another had pierced them away with a bone-coloured spear.

Seeing their backs, Chris had figured out who they were fairly quickly.

"I hope you don't mind us giving you a little helping hand," Pultra stated.

It had taken the three of them a while to get here, having to go the long way around, but from the shockwaves of the fighting from before alone, they knew where to come and find where the action was taking place.

"The good news is that we need these two anyway," Calva said. "The bad news is that the two of them are together."

Although Chris did originally want to face Unzoku on his own, now that there were two, he didn't mind the help. There was something about the fight between Chris and Unzoku from before, something raw that he wanted to keep.

It was as if the two of them were competing for who was the best and strongest, who was the strongest werewolf. And now, with all these interruptions getting in the way, the spark was lost.

The champions were thinking about something else as well. They were strong and believed they could take out the Demon Kings, at least the ones that had already been taken out. The most difficult to deal with were Unzoku and the two right-hand men. They were hoping to help Chris out with one, not two.

Still, they were in the situation they were in now, and there was nothing they could do about it.

"Look at these fools," Tenbris said. "The champions betrayed us because they thought they stood a chance with these people behind them. They are truly pathetic!"

Tenbris raised his hands, and when he did, he felt a slight heat before complete darkness. His body had dropped to the ground, falling with no head, blood pouring out.

Picking up the lifeless Tenbris body, Unzoku opened his mouth wide, as he took another bite.
