When Quinn had disappeared from the group's sight, they looked up and they could see him rushing towards the portal. They wanted to reach out to stop him, and Edvard and Hikel even somewhat attempted to do so by jumping up.

However, they were unable to fly, or walk in the air like Quinn was able to, and even if they could he was already too far gone for them.

He had reached the portal, and the strange red mist energy that was coming out of it, was attaching itself onto him. There was a bit of resistance at first, almost as if the mist was trying to push him away.

It felt strange, as if a part of his body was being rejected by this other world. When he felt this, he let out a bit of his aura, and in doing so, something strange had happened. Suddenly, rather than his body being rejected, it was being more accepted and it felt like he was being pulled by whatever was on the other side.

'This is the moment of truth, I made my decision long ago!' Quinn thought to himself, heading right in, and the portal had closed up right behind him.

The group were left stunned as they looked up at the sky, they couldn't believe what had just happened. There was nothing there, it was as if the portal was never open in the first place.

There were no deadly creatures, no red mist, and worst of all, there was no Quinn around them. When they were starting to come to the realisation of what was happening, Logan was the first to turn toward Agent 4.

From underneath his feet, condensed beast energy blasted from the ground, and he had grabbed Agent 4 right by the neck. Multiple arms came out from his back, and started to hold Agent 4 in the air while restraining him as well.

"What did you do!" Logan asked, his voice cracking as he shouted those words. Usually Logan was calm and collected, even in tense situations he would try to figure out what was happening, many had never seen him like this, this side of him.

"I thought there was a chance that you could be working for the other side, working for Immortui, but I decided to give you the benefit of doubt. You have helped me for so long showing no signs‚Ä¶ and now you go ahead and do this, and now you trap him!

"I should have known when you were drawing those strange symbols around Jessica!"

Speaking of Jessica, it looked like she was no longer restrained herself. Andy, using his great strength, had pulled them off, although she did appear exhausted as he leant her his shoulder.

Still, she was just as worried about Quinn as the rest.

'Quinn, after all you did to save me, now you have gone yourself‚Ä¶ this is not right.'

"Wait!" Agent 4 replied back startled. He had expected somewhat of a reaction but thought he would at least have time to explain himself, and the last person he expected to act like this was Logan.

"You need to give me a chance to explain. I am not working for Immortui, everything I did, all of what I did, was at the request of Quinn himself!"

"Okay, now we really need to beat the truth out of him." Edvard said, pounding his fist into the palm of his hand.

"Wait." Hikel replied. "There was no change in his heart beat, or temperature. Although I can't be certain, I do have some skills in telling if one is lying or not, and he seems to be telling the truth."

Hearing Hikel say these words, Logan was thinking back, there were some strange interactions that had occurred between Agent 4 and Quinn. It was quite possible that he was telling the truth, but it was hard to believe, why would Quinn do all of this?

"As I said‚Ä¶ those symbols I drew on Jessica, they were fake, they were useless. You said you didn't recognise them, that's because they weren't real." Agent 4 explained. "I was just buying time for Quinn to be ready to travel through the portal."

"You mean, what you said about the power reversing into Jessica was a lie?" Andy asked. I think you should take a look at

Agent 4 nodded.

"After altering the symbols, the work was already done, the portal could be closed, but Quinn asked me to do him a favour. That I would inform him when the portal was about to close, and he told me what he was going to do.

"There were two things that he made me promise, one was not to tell anyone else, and the second, was to make the window small, so no one else could follow him. This is the honest truth, and if you think about it, I think you all know the reason why he would do something like this."

Logan's mechanical arms started to lower Agent 4 down. Even being held up it felt like he wasn't trying to break free, and Logan was the quickest to think of the reason for him to do all of this.

He thought back to the information that he had learned from Richard Eno, and the conversations he had with the others. The other vampires did as well, about how to end all of this, was there a way.

"Magnus is not the end." Logan stated. "It was something Quinn had said a few times. He had already decided back then that to end all of this, the one thing he needed to do was to get rid of Immortui, that's why he went through that portal."

"But then why!" Jessica said in a weak voice. She was still leaning against Andy and it looked almost painful for her to speak, but it was something she felt like she needed to say. "Why would he do this, why wouldn't he tell us his plans and go off on his own!"Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

That was an answer that even the original's could give, even though they hadn't known him for long.

"Because he didn't want anyone else to get hurt." Edvard answered. "People around him are always getting hurt, and Immortui wanted him, so he gave him what he wanted and has now gone to stop him on his own."

The others were left in silence for a while, that was until Jessica finally decided to speak up.

"Can he do it?" She asked. "Will Quinn be able to do it on his own? Isn't this practically a whole other universe with beings stronger than those that we have here. We have seen the scary things Immortui was able to do here, but there, he won't be restricted. If that's the case, then it might be impossible for Quinn to do this on his own.

"We have to help him somehow."

"That's impossible." Agent 4 answered. "The only known way to open a portal is a giant mass amount of energy. The first time we had the red heart, the second we had you, but it only worked because Quinn was here. With both of you, it worked out, but without him, we have no way to open a portal to the other side and help him even if we wanted to.

"Unless, there is another way, but I don't know one." Agent 4 said.
