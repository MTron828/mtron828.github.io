Seeing Logan on the screen saying what he was saying, it felt calming. Although Quinn's name in the past was referred to as the Hero, the one who had resolved the issues with the vampires, celestials, and the Dalki, that effort wasn't something that was done on his own.

People often forgot about that, and it was one of the things that Quinn wanted to correct, was the credit. It wasn't just his effort, it was the effort of the whole of the Cursed faction. When everyone's memories had changed, it meant that whatever the problems were, this time he needed to try and resolve them himself.

However, it proved difficult and even now, Logan was helping him in some way.

"There is a lot for me to explain, so I need you to listen carefully." Logan said on the video, as he moved and went to a floating orb device. It was large in size, and had several visible currents running through it.

"This device here is the Green family's legacy. A device that was created so one could pass on visual memories to the next person. You can think of it as a diary, only far more accurate.

"My family, when they had perished, they had used this device to pass on their memories to me. Since then, I have also been updating the diary with my own memories to pass on my legacy. At the same time to keep a record of information I had, as well as that of Richard Eno. It goes without saying that device can only work with a member of the Green family, which means it can not be tampered with."

Quinn was figuring it out, figuring out why Logan had decided to send him this message.

"You see, for me there were no differences in my day to day life. I did as I usually would have done, and when I went to update the diary, that's when I figured out there was a problem. The visuals and the memories that were currently in the diary didn't match up with my own.

"What I could remember in my head, in my own brain, didn't match with what was recorded. In fact the machine also realised that, stating if I would like to override the current data with what was already in my head. Because of this, I went through and watched all of the visuals."

The Orb was starting to display holograms in the video, showing videos of what they had been through and showing a lot of Quinn in his memories.

"How was this possible, how could someone who was so involved in my life, be someone that I no longer had any recognition of anymore. In the end, I had to make a choice. Do I trust what I could remember now in my mind, or what is recorded?

"Going by my ethos, machines are far more trustable than humans, and that includes myself. Which is why I decided to help you Quinn.

"I have to admit it is strange, me putting in so much effort to help someone that I don't know, but as I watched the past videos over and over, I realised how much you must have meant to me for me to do all of that."

Seeing and hearing everything so far was bringing a tear to Layla's eye. Similar to Quinn, she too was feeling the strain of not having everyone. Yes, she had her family, but no one to talk to about the past as it was too risky to make friends and more.

"That Logan, he's one crazy guy." Layla said, wiping her face.

"You're right, only Logan would record past events and on top of that, only he would trust what was on a machine rather than what was in his head." Quinn stated.

"As I researched more into the mess, I found out that my own lab was used to create programs that would erase any data, articles or videos that mentioned you. I have managed to obtain all that data and store it in a database, but at the moment, there is no point in releasing it, and it would alert Jim to my own position in all of this.

"When looking at the data, it was quite obvious as to who was behind everything, but getting to the certain individual was troublesome even for me, so I needed some help. Searching through the memories I tried to find someone who might believe me if I told them the truth and I had finally found someone.

"Someone who has the same face as yourself and is kept by Jim's side, Vicnent Eno."

This was good news for Quinn, due to the past between the two, he was somewhat worried that Jim would kill Vincent the moment the two of them met.

"Not only did Vincent have a calm head on his shoulders and could understand the data, if he was ever to meet you it would be more than enough evidence. Fortunately, the two of us met easier than expected as Jim had sent Vincent to me.

"He had asked the two of us to create a device that could stretch the effect of abilities outward. To research how certain conditions worked and more. During this time I spoke to Vincent a lot, and managed to convince him of the truth, at the same time we had finished completing the device, not fully knowing what it was being used for.

"Now for the important parts for yourself. Working with Vincent, we were able to uncover a lot. Jim asks Vincent to do a lot of tasks on his behalf, which has allowed him to find out a lot."

Quinn and Layla leaned forward making sure not to miss a word, as Logan went into detail about the next subject.

"There is a person, who used to work side by side with Jim, as well as Jack Truedream. During their travels it was because of this person they were able to get backhand deals across the universe to start the Marpo Cruise business.

"This person's name goes by Malik. An ability user who is able to change memories. The ability is a powerful one and there seems to be no limit to what he can change, adjust or replace completely from one's mind.

"When cross referencing it with other information, it is without a doubt an ability that would be considered god slayer level."

Quinn's heart thumped, there was such a dangerous person, this entire time that he had no clue about. If it truly was a god slayer level ability, then it would also explain how Ray had been influenced as well.

After all, even Russ, another one with a god slayer ability was able to copy the powers of the celestials and Quinn's shadow power. Although he was limited by the amount of MC cells he could use.

Without having one's ability themselves it was hard to know how the MC cells would be used. Was it the amount of memories that changed or depending on who it was used on. If it was the latter, after fighting Ray, Quinn still couldn't imagine the ability working on him.

"A strong ability like that needs a strong condition. Even Jack Truedream needed to touch his victims through their lips. As for Malik, the condition was a touch. Without touching another he was unable to change their memories."

Both Quinn and Layla raised an eyebrow at that point, because it didn't make any sense. According to Layla, everyone's memories had changed after they experienced a headache. It would be impossible to change people's memories one by one like this.

"By now, you are perhaps slightly confused." Logan stated. "Which makes sense, but if you listen back to what I said before, me and Vicnent had successfully created a device that would allow one to use their ability in a wide range. However, even if Malik was placed in this device it would have little effect.

"Although the amount of MC cells he has is large, it still wasn't enough to have a wide effect for his ability. I ran the calculations and it didn't make sense.

"That was until I realised that there was another person, who has been removed from our memories. If it was with him, then it would work."Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

"Another person?" Quinn thought.
