The Namrik's planet had successfully been conquered and it was mainly due to the actions of the vampires.

For a second, as the Namriks witnessed internal fighting, they thought they had a chance. All of them were glued to the vampire's efforts as he took down his own, one by one, and unleashed a power that could be felt throughout the planet.

Yet in the end it amounted to nothing. The Namriks were allowed to continue to operate as they had been but a new base had been placed on the planet where a token army would be.

Most of their technology as well as their minerals and beast crystals that were gathered by them would be handed over. For the Namriks themselves, they felt like slaves.

As for the main person who was mainly behind the attack, Jim Eno, he was no longer on the planet and instead was back on the Marpo Cruise inside a secure training room. There were a few masked by his side but not the same that were with him before and neither was Ray there.

Meanwhile an injured and bloody Edvard was seen on the floor. He was in a worse state than when on the Namrik's planet.

"You fool, how could you even have so much loyalty for someone you barely know!" Jim shouted. "It was impossible for the two of you to be alive at the same time. So why did you follow him? Tell me how he tricked or forced you."

Jim had been asking the same question repeatedly and Edvard had been doing the same thing as he smiled.

"Do you really think something like torture would work against an original. At any point and time I could take my own life. I have lived a long and fulfilling life. The only reason why I haven't is because it would be embrassing to do so because of you."

Jim ran up toward the fallen Edvard and swung his leg back, as he threw it forward a large amount of blood aura was released throwing Edvard in the air spinning. Blood was splattered all over the room, and Edvard's bones were starting to heal.

After touching the floor, Edvard pushed himself up and smiled toward Jim.

"What are you so scared of? That everyone will find out you're a fake? The fact that the Dalki you created in the past were a failure? Why can't you stand the fact that there are great people in this world and you simply aren't one of them."

Edvard coughed letting out a little bit more blood while continuing to laugh.

In the room the two of them weren't alone because Malik who was on the cruise had also been brought along with him.

"Let's see your attitude change suddenly. Malik, change his memories, make him remember his dear friend Quinn as an enemy that wiped out his family, his loved ones in the past, and more." Jim stated.

Malik looked at Jim in a way as if to ask him if he was really sure about this.

"I'm only changing one memory, there is no need to talk to Jack about this nor the need to use the other's powers. I know you can do this much, now we have to do this much.

"We can't have any more distractions, we have to continue with what we are doing and move on. There has to be something that can stabilise me somewhere in this universe a bit more.

"Maybe even those celestials will have an answer. Remember‚Ä¶ you promised me!"

No more was said as Malik moved forward doing as he had been doing for a long time now.

Layla had finally finished cooking up a few different meals that would fit everyone's taste. For example, meat had been ground up into a paste for Galen.

Although he did have two teeth that stuck out, which were his two fangs and they would elongate at times when he was a bit moody, Layla still felt more comfortable making food for him this way.

For Minny, a juice box of blood was splattered over her raw steak to give it a bit of flavour, while also cut up into strips for easier eating.

For herself and Russ a mainly meat dish and been made so the others didn't feel so left out or that they were eating something different, but they also had some roast potatoes and veg one the side as well, while she had a go at making some sauce.

"Alright, Minny go get your father and the others and tell them the food is ready." Layla ordered and she nodded already heading off.

Meanwhile, cutlery, glasses as well as other operations were handled by Galen. It was always impressive that he knew what she wanted and there was no need for the two of them to communicate.

After everything had been set up, Minny had turned a corner and she was walking back with Russ as well as Ceril.

"Where's your father?" Layla asked immediately.

"They said daddy was busy and doing something important so we should leave him alone." Minny replied.

Layla didn't say anything and just sat down at the table.

"What are you two doing, or are you two busy as well?" Layla asked.

Hearing this Ceril rushed to sit at her seat while Russ whispered to himself.

"Your wife is quite a scary person." Russ mumbled, but quickly sat down at the table as well.

There was silence as everyone dug into their food a bit at a time. In order to make the awkwardness die down, Russ started to rub his stomach.

"The food is so delicious, I haven't had anything like this in a while." Russ tried his hardest to put on a smile but it didn't come natural to him.

A second later and a knife was slammed loudly onto the table.

"I can't believe him, this could very well be the last time we can have a meal like this as a family together, and he can't spare five minutes?" Layla huffed.

The others wanted to say something, as it was a tough situation for them all but they did understand how Layla felt, on top of that they didn't want to get in her way.

Getting up from her seat, she started to walk off.

"Alright, let's go see what he's doing that so important that he has to do it right now." Layla mumbled.

"Do you think we should go with her, just in case anything happens?" Ceril asked.

"This is something that the two of them need to figure out. There is no need for either one of us to get involved." Russ took another bite. "But I wasn't lying this is really good. Besides do you think that we could stop anything that was to take place? Oh right, I forgot you don't know him so well, but even if Layla turned into a demon herself I doubt she could do anything to him."

Layla was storming to the room where Quinn was and she soon noticed something strange.

Emotions in a dark red fog could be seen covering the hallway. The emotions in this smog was something she had never experienced before. The power felt different, having a hint of what vampires had felt like, but also like something almost out of this world.

Tha anger that she had built up was starting to fade and she had eventually reached the room. Standing outside, there was a strange heat, and part of the door looked to be almost melted.

There was no way for Layla to open the door normally and the strange thick red substance that looked like lava where the door had melted, she was a little afraid to touch.

Using her telekensis power, she pushed the broken door out of the way and stepped into the room.

All around there were similar scenes in the room as the door. Markings were covered on top of one another and the strange red slush was seen all over in places.

The room was unrecognisable to what it was before and her eyes soon spotted Quinn laying there on the floor.

"Quinn!" Layla shouted, rushing over to see if he was okay. His heart was beating but his eyes were still closed.

Not too far from behind a few footsteps could be heard.

"What‚Ä¶ Did you do?" Russ asked.

"Did mommy kill daddy!" Minny started to cry.
