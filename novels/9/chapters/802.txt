Chapter 803 Everyone is better than me

The others knowing that they were now no longer going to fight that monster of a Blade, thought they might have been given a break. Seeing the less frightening two coming towards them. However, they quickly realised that wasn’t the case, especially when the first thing the two of them did, was fire out lightning from the palm of their hands.

This was blocked by raising several walls of earth from Oscar. The lightning had managed to pierce through three thick walls before being stopped by the fourth one. Thankfully, earth was the lightning ability’s weakness. The bad thing was, they all knew that lightning wouldn’t be the only power they could use as well.

"So they all can copy the same powers it looks like." Oscar said.

"Yes, and even these two have lightning powers that are stronger than my own, so we have to watch out." Owen added, looking back at Sil, who was still recovering. If he expended himself anymore, he could faint; however, if he was given the time to rest, maybe he could help them out.

"You two, stop relying on the kid." Chris said as he stepped out in front. "I can’t believe the leaders of the world, now are looking back, waiting for that kid to recover. Even though we all don’t gel well, we all fight for the same thing, for better lives for humans. Right now, I see two people in front of us that are looking to support someone who doesn’t have the same wish as us. They are an enemy, and it’s our job that get rid of them for the future generation."

Oscar knew Chris’s words were right, and there was some hope. Even though these two could use multiple abilities and had a stronger attack, he could tell it wasn’t as strong as that old man. Before, no matter how many walls he raised of earth, the lightning still would have broken through them all if it was an attack from Hilston.

The only thing that was strong enough to stop Hilston’s attack was the demon tier weapon’s active skill and the shadow from the strange man.

The three of them, now fully committing to the fight in front of them, were more ready than before.

Nearly everyone by the sidelines, Logan, Bonny, Void and Fex, had been too engrossed in watching what was happening between Arthur and Hilston. They failed to notice what Quinn was doing, all incept Logan that was.

He had seen Quinn silently cast his shadow travel ability to move away. Still, he never reappeared and instead went into the direction of the demon tier beast.

’Quinn, I know that the demon tier beast has been significantly weekend, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy. I hope you know what you are doing.’ Logan thought.

Travelling through the shadow as fast as he could, Quinn was trying to get to the Demon tier beats without being seen. He wished he could help Arthur, he thought he could have confidence in his skills, but after seeing the power of a single demon tier weapon, Quinn didn’t have much hope.

’The only thing I can do is complete the quest and evolve myself. Come on you stupid crab. Let’s do this!’

Travelling up the hill, the crab could be seen. The limbs that Chris had cut off still hadn’t healed and were only partly contracted inside its underbelly. The black liquid blood was pouring from it, and the beast could be seen breathing in and out slowly as if it was in pain.

It was a sad sight to see the beast in such a way. Humans were having to go onto these beasts planets and killing them to harvest their crystals. In a way, they were only defending their territory or fighting for their lives. But Quinn could never think about this while fighting them.

If he did, then what of the human race? The Dalki didn’t care about them, and it was something they needed. When Quinn finally got within a certain range, the crab started to move. Even while travelling in the shadow, it looked like the crab could tell something was heading its way.

It lifted it’s two large front claws and started to snap them in the air. Each clack rang out. When it slammed the first one down, Quinn had popped out from the shadow and at the same time threw a blood crescent kick towards the joints of the claw.

The joints were the weaker part of the crab, and now using his second stage Qi, if he managed to serve the limb, it wouldn’t heal again.

’Dealing with two claws is a lot easier than before.’ Quinn said as he avoided them hammering down towards him. Each time he would avoid the strike, he would throw out a long-range blood crescent kick, weakening the joint slowly.

The crab not only had fewer limbs to attack with, but it seemed like it was also slower than before.

’If I can keep this up, it looks like I can make it out of here without getting hurt. I just have to not make a mistake.’

Some form of success was seen, as the outer shell of the joints were cracking, and finally, one of the joints had cracked open. Seeing this, Quinn went to summon his shadow scythe. With it in hand, swinging it above his head, he was able to extend the scythe with the shadow and swung it down as hard as he could.

"Break you damn crab!" Quinn screamed as he swung down with all his strength. When it landed, it had hit the floor, throwing up rocks and grass in the air, and then the ground was felt shaking again, making him lose balance.

His shadow scythe was unsuccessful. It had hit nothing but the empty ground. What was surprising was how the crab was still able to move like so. When Quinn swung down, it had avoided the blow by jumping back, and its body landing on the ground was what had caused the big crash and vibrations in the environment.

There was some good news from this though, when looking at the crab, Quinn could see using his inspect skill that it had gone from a weekend state to a critical condition. Avoiding the blow when it landed seemed to have hurt it more so than it would have if Quinn was even successful with the attack.

It was instinct for the crab to try to save its limb, but its other injuries on its body had only worsened from jumping.

’Critical, it means I’m nearly there, I still have about half my health left due to me using the blood crescent kick so much, but I can do this.’ Quinn thought. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

He rushed forward towards the crab, grabbing the scythes. Maybe in such a state, there was an easier way to finish it. Still, when he got close, Quinn quickly saw something that frightened him. He promptly put the dual scythes away and immediately started to go on the defensive.

Inside the crab’s mouth, foam and bulbs started to appear. Quinn thought maybe it was too weak to make an attack like this, but it didn’t seem to be the case.

’Thats the attack that Oscar used his ice barrier to block, sh*t I’m going to have to use everything I have to block it.’

The jet of water could be seen coming out from the crab’s mouth, and in a panic, Quinn first used his blood wall skill, using up 45 points of HP. Only leaving him with 5, he cast the wall of shadow and placed this over the blood, like he would have done when using his scythes. Next, with his hand, he placed it on the wall activating his second aura of Qi.

Using so much blood, if this wasn’t able to block the attack, Quinn was done.

The jet stream smashed into the wall Quinn had created, and there seemed to be a close struggle as the water wasn’t moving forward and the wall wasn’t being pushed back, but touching the wall with his hand, Quinn could feel the sheer power.

’This damn thing is in a critical state and can still make an attack like this!’

The first line of defence to go was the shadow, Quinn’s Mc points were now at zero as the shadow disappeared.

’If only I had as much strength as Arthur!’ Quinn complained.

Then covering the blood wall with the coat of Qi, Quinn continually supplied more. He was careful as he didn’t want to be exhausted after this; otherwise, what else could he do? But soon, the coating of the second Qi was also broken as Quinn couldn’t supply it with anymore.

’If I had as much control or Qi as Chris.’

Then lastly was the wall of blood shattered, and it didn’t take long for that to break either.

’This perfect wall of blood, I bet all the other vampire leaders would look down on me.’ Quinn said.

Falling to his knees, Quinn looked up and could see that the jet stream of water had been blocked, but at what cost?

He no longer had blood in his blood bank, no more MC cells and his Qi was minimal.

"I’ve lost..."
