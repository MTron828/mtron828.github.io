Peter was back to normal and in one piece, he moved his limbs about as if they were foreign to him, swinging them about in the air and jumping a few times several metres in the air.

"I hate to say it, but I think that was a close call." Peter said

"It's a good thing that one memory wasn't removed from you." Quinn tapped the side of his head.

"Yes, always protect the head. Although I feel like even though I would have protected my head the rest of my body wouldn't have come back."

Quinn had to agree, perhaps this time he would have to owe it to Bliss for bringing Peter's body back, but then again, would she have done anything if he didn't force her?

Regardless, both Jim and Bliss were able to do things with a nest crystal that I never knew about. A nest crystal even managed to save my life, and it was only because of Sil, I learned how to increase my MC cells, looks like I'm the one with the least knowledge about these things.'

Footsteps came over toward Quinn, armour rattling with each step, for a second Quinn turned his head and was about to go into fight mode with Ray, but he realised that there was no need anymore.

'I was fighting him for so long it was almost just natural instinct.'

"You have grown a lot stronger since last time." Ray said. "I know in the past we never fought toe to toe but I always had an idea of your strength and I have to say I'm beyond impressed.

"I thought that maybe no one would ever surpass me in strength, but if someone did then having it be someone that belongs to my family line, I think I would be happy about that, and hey maybe you will be able to do it."

'Able to do it, does that mean Ray still thinks he is stronger than me even after that fight. Ah, I guess I should just see it as a compliment.' Quinn thought.

"You managed to stop me from doing far worse than what I would have been capable of. If it wasn't for you, maybe all three of the alien races involved would have been killed.

"Although I have long passed beyond the point where I feel guilty for these types of actions, I still feel like I owe you. If there is ever anything you need in the future, you can turn in this favour."

After having a battle with Ray, Quinn knew that he would be a valuable asset in the future. Whether he would need him or not was another thing, but it was always good to have.

"Do you know why Mundus went away, when the other's showed up. It seems like the celestials don't bother you too much?" Quinn asked.

"Mundus?" Ray replied back, having no idea who that was. "You mean that alien looking person. I don't know much about him, or the celestials, like I said. I figured I was just too strong for them to deal with.

"They probably had decided long ago that it was better to leave me be, rather than try to take me on. It's better for the both of us, but don't feel jealous. That Bliss and Sera have both gone against me before. Well, in Bliss' case, she made me go through a re education."

A little of Ray's aura crept out. Speaking of his past with Bliss seemed to put Ray in a sour mood.

"Anyway, there is no use talking to me, you should use your shadow thing to go ahead and be with your family and friends. I'm sure there is a lot for you to do, changing everyone's memories, including those back on earth, for one.

"You should let me deal with everything else."

"Everything else?" Quinn replied.

"I spent quite a bit of time with Jim." Ray explained. "I know where the Marpo Cruises were made, I know all of the bases that he built and went to. I won't rest until I get rid of every single one of them.

"Before I go, I'll stop by and see Logan, just to make sure he has a device ready that you can use to contact me. He can update me on information on anything to do with Jim, and for you to call in that favour whenever you need it."

Quinn nodded, if it was Ray, then he was sure he could deal with whatever surprises Jim had, even if it was a ten spike Dalki, Ray could take them out. Not that they expected trouble of that calibre to prop up.Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

"One more thing, your shadow power, you have done well to make it your own but I do have to warn you." Ray thought back to the battle, to the infected Shadow beasts he saw. "Be careful with the shadow. It is a power that has always had a will of its own.

"In my time, one of the shadow infected even broke off from the original host making its power its own. I'm sure you have seen it, the shadow adapting to each person it has, just make sure that your always the one in control and not the other way round."

It was the last piece of advice from Ray, and Quinn would take it seriously. With that, he activated his shadow link and it wasn't long till he was able to link up with Minny.

The shadow behind Minny started to extend creating a pool of shadow behind her. Then a figure started to seemingly grow out of the shadow. It had caught the attention of everyone there.

"Quinn!" Layla shouted running up and giving him a big hug, she held onto him tight, but it was hard to do so properly with all the armour on his body.

"My, my, my, you have changed a lot since I last saw you, that armour is certainly impressive." Logan commented.

Quinn didn't say much, he just looked at everyone with a big smile on his face. He was taking in the moment, of everyone recognising everyone. His eyes did fall on the frail Sil, and it angered him a little, but realised there was no need for him to be angry anymore.

"Tch, look at him." Russ said. "He's not even injured, while we were all risking our lives, what was he even doing? The reason why the war stopped was because of us anyway, he didn't even do anything."

To Russ, it would look like that, since his armour was healed already from the marks that were on them and Quinn looked completely fine, not even tired from his fight.

"What happened, how are the Amra?" Layla asked.

"The Amra, a lot of them died. I didn't make the armour as quickly as I thought I could, but quite a few of them managed to survive. At the moment they are still held up in their tower.

"I was planning to get Wince and Stark to come with us and head back to the tower, that way the three can talk."

Quinn looked around, they were still on the Marpo Cruise at the main console. It was slowly descending toward the planet they were on before. The plan was to get anyone who needed emergency help, the help they needed as soon as possible, to try and save as many lives as they could from this war.

"I don't see them here, I guess they must be down on one of the planets below." Quinn said.

The faces of the others were scrunched up, and looking away from him, and as for his daughter, she was unable to stop sobbing as she thought about them.

"What happened‚Ä¶ what happened to them?" Quinn asked.
