Cuteness Unleashed

The system error screens, they wouldn't stop pinging, and for some reason everytime a message would come up, a great shock would be sent into his body. It felt like he was being stabbed all over at once, what was worse, the pain, it felt the same as when he was human. 

As a vampire, his vampire self, it almost was as if his injuries were relatively dulled. A simple cut wouldn't hurt as much, allowing him to continue on fighting. Even with serious wounds, Quinn would be able to continue battling, but if he felt this type of pain while out on the battlefield, he didn't think he would even be able to move if he wished.

'What is going on? Why is the system going crazy, and why the heck is it affecting my body, is this something to do with Immortui?' 

Before he knew it, blood was trickling out of Quinn's mouth. It was foaming up and spilling to the sides. To the point where even Immortui thought that something was strange.

Blood continued to trickle out of Quinn's mouth and even ran down Immortui's arm. 

"I thought you were strong, your body can't even handle this, what is wrong with you!" Immortui was almost furious at how fragile Quinn was. He had done something similar with the last champions and yet they had never had a reaction like this. 

The red energy that was swirling toward Quinn's head stopped, and Immortui threw Quinn to the ground. His body bounced off the floor, while creating a large dent in the ground, a small crater around his body, before he landed again. 

Now lying flat out on his back, Quinn's body was shaking uncontrollably, as if it was being shocked.

The screens continued to pop in front of Quinn, and his sight was starting to blur. Not just his sight, but the system screens in front of him were glitching, and they started to zap all over his view. 

His hand reached out, until eventually, the shocks stopped, and Quinn's arm fell to his side.

"What was that all about?" Immortui said. He was cautious to approach Quinn. "At least, he is still alive. Right now in his mind, he should be going through hell. When he wakes up, he will beg me never to go back or experience that type of pain again, and if it doesn't work, I'll just have to repeat the process a few times." 

Immortui started to walk forward. 

"It's a shame I didn't get to experience the full extent of your powers and skills. To have the power to defeat a demon king, I'm sure you amount to more than what I just saw, but I need you on my side, and I'm getting sick and tired of waiting."

Leaning down, Immortui went down to pick up Quinn, but as he did, his body disappeared. Sensing an energy to his side, he looked to his right. 

"The… Boneclaw!" Immortui blinked a few times, wondering what the familiar was doing here, and why he would be brave enough to take Quinn right from underneath him.

"Get away from him!" Two voices shouted. 

Turning his head once again, Immortui could see two fists coming towards him. One had a strange head tail wrapped around his arm, powering it with a familiar energy, it was celestial energy. While the other was covered in a red armour that was radiating with power even in a place like this. 

As his fist moved through, energy was gathering from the sides like a meteorite going through space. The two fists landed flush, right on Immortui's chin, sending him up in the air and his body spinning several times. 

Swinging his arms by his side, Immortui had managed to balance himself, and looked at the two below. 

"Who are you… how are there more people that have come over to this side?" Immortui thought. "And who would be foolish enough to come here!"

In the air, lightning struck right at Immortui's body. Several bolts from around a hundred different locations were hitting his body all at once. The armour on his body was reacting as it moved and swirled after being hit. 

"Who would be foolish enough to come here!" Sil said in the air, with his hundred clones all around, still firing out the lightning. "His friends who are going to make you pay!"Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

A portion of the lightning had stopped, to allow two of the Sil's through. At that moment, two of them had giant hands which smashed right into Immortui. It pushed him out of the air, and sent him to the ground, but Immortui didn't crash. 

Instead, he was using his strength to push back against the fists. 

"I was surprised at first, so I was a little caught off guard. You guys are quite strong, you will make great additions to my army!" Immortui shouted, and the colourless glow started to surround his two fists.

From behind, one of the Sil clone's had telported and grabbed onto Immortui, right after, the two of them disappeared and were no longer on the battlefield. 

Now, Immortui along with one of the Sil clones, were on a completely different planet, the ground itself was a metallic blue colour with large shards all over the place. 

"What did you do?" Immortui said, as he went to swing his arm, but it had hit nothing as Sil had teleported again to his side. 

"As long as we are here, we will never let you get Quinn." Sil stated. "He is someone who has protected us for a long time, and now it's our time to protect him."

The moment Sil had finished his sentence, Immortui's fist was right through his stomach. 

"Then you shall all die." 

Sil smiled at that moment. 

"Too bad for you, I'm just a clone." 

The body completely disappeared from sight, and now Immortui was left on his own on a cold surface. 

"Arghhhh!" Immortui roared and the energy swirled around the whole planet breaking off large chunks of rocks, flying off into the space around him.

Back on the desert-like floor, Edvard, Peter, and the real Sil had regrouped. 

"That was a close one." Sil said. 

"Is he alive?" Peter asked. 

"His heart, it's still beating." Edvard said. "But, I'm more worried about that other guy coming back, we need to get out of here and fast. Far away!!!"

"Agreed, everyone grab onto me!" Sil shouted. 

They did as asked, and grabbing onto Sil, he started to focus. His power, it was harder to use, or to direct it, when he had no clue where he was going. Before he was directing it towards noise he could hear so he had some idea. What he didn't want to do was end up teleporting to the same planet he had just come from. 

Closing his eyes, they teleported , moving from place to place, but Sil was frightened. He teleported again as soon as they appeared somewhere, and again. 

"What's wrong, why aren't we stopping!" Evard asked. 

They could only see a place for a few moments before Sil would continue to teleport, one after the other. 

"We have to get further away!" Sil said. Continuing to teleport, again, and again. Sweat was running down his face and he was exhausted, and it was clear to the others that something was wrong. 

Just where would they end up, and what was wrong with Sil?
