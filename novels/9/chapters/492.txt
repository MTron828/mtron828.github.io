Chapter 493 The calling

It was finally time for Quinn to explain his situation. His close friends had heard this story before, but there were a few people who didn’t know the truth behind Quinn. This included the likes of Silver, Fex and Arthur.

Just like Arthur, Quinn too had started from the beginning. Explaining how he was gifted a book from his parents, and once a drop of blood from his finger had touched the book, he had turned into what he had become today. There was no need to explain the system part or about the AI in his head. These weren’t important parts.

However, he did explain that when he had turned Peter, he felt something special inside him click, and the same thing happened again. As for him being the tenth leader this was found out when he had completed the blood ritual.

The way Quinn had explained the information the system had given him along the way, was by saying it would just come into his head from time to time. The first time being when he had turned Peter. The information would enter as if he already knew it. Then he explained the same thing happened as soon as he stepped into the castle. He knew for sure he was the leader and Edward the vampire knight from the previous ten confirmed it.

"Wait! So you’re saying you really are the tenth leader!" Fex shouted. "I thought you were just saying it to buy some time. To maybe get them off your back."

"It makes sense now why you were able to change so many people into vampires without your body being affected." Silver said. "The fast progression and such it was all due to you being turned into a vampire through some irregular method."

Hearing Quinn’s tale about how he had become a vampire, had reminded Arthur of his own. He knew he felt something similar between the two, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. It wasn’t just the shadow power that connected them. It was the fact that Quinn had a human heart.

"Have you learned where the book has come from?" Arthur asked.

Quinn shook his head. He had ideas, but nothing solid.

"Based on what you have told me so far, it would seem like that book was originally created by one of the tenths powers. It sounds like something that ability could do. This is why, when it turned you into a vampire, it also made you the leader. Were any of your parents vampires?"

"No," Quinn replied. "They weren’t and I’m a hundred percent human before, I’m sure of that. The problem is, I can’t even ask them now how they got the book."

Although Quinn had said this, there was one person who could tell him. And he had promised to tell Quinn when this was over.

Fex and Silver were in the corner pleased and smiling, it was the happiest they had seen them since they had entered the castle.

"What’s with you two?" Layla asked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"You guys don’t understand. If Quinn is really the tenth leader, then there is a good chance my punishment will be lessened, I finally have hope." Fex said.

"But, if Quinn was the leader all along, then why didn’t he just tell them?" Cia asked. "You knew about being the leader when you turned Peter first, right?"

"Actually, that isn’t a good idea." Arthur did the explaining for the others here. He knew what was most likely to happen and what the vampire council was like. For some reason they aimed for the king’s seat like mad men. As if when they obtained it, they would became some sort of god. He knew how far some of the vampires were willing to go to get that seat.

With Arthur explaining the difficulties and the possibilities of Quinn being killed if he was to mention it, Quinn was happy for once he didn’t have to explain and Arthur was confirming what the system had to say.

Now, Arthur wanted to get to the serious questions. He was happy to learn about the boy more, and how he got his vampire powers to be, but after learning about Quinn. He was doubtful whether he would know what he really wanted to find out.

"Can I ask about the shadow ability you obtained? At first, I thought you were possibly one of the newest recruits of the punishers. One that was placed after I had gone into sleep. Although we had moved to a new planet. We still had a system of our own for our people, and the punishers still acted as a type of police. We needed to make sure to pass on the powers generation from generation if there was ever the need to stop the vampires and intervene. But now, I’m pretty sure you were not." Said Arthur.

Quinn went on to explain about how he had found the shadow ability book by complete coincidence on one of the vampire planets. The planets they would use for training vampires that were coming of age, turning into a vampire noble.

There were a hundred ways for this ability book to have gotten on that planet, maybe a vampire in training of the past, and when the humans came, they had found the book. Or a human had killed a vampire who carried the book and kept it for storage when they found out they couldn’t learn it.

"Although you are not a punisher, it seems you have learned to adapt the shadow with your own skills quite well. I should expect at least this much from the person who freed me."

"The person who freed you?" Quinn asked, as it was the second time he had heard this.

"Oh right you do not know. I wanted to ask you as well. The underground settlement, there was a tower and a sword behind a glass pane, I believe it looked like this." Arthur said as he pulled the sword from out of his shadow.

"Ahhh!" Fex said jumping from his seat. "Quinn, that’s the tower we went to. Where we fought against that king tier beast."

Now Quinn was sure of it. The armor Arthur was wearing when he was fighting, the sword. These were all things he had seen in the tower.

"But I don’t remember freeing you?" Quinn said.

"It seems that it might have been unintentional," Arthur replied. "Before passing on I handed a blood crystal with my family bloodline to my right-hand man. He was free to do what he wished with it, but it was mainly if he ever needed to wake me again."

"You’re right, I do remember that blood crystal. So when I inserted it into that machine, that’s what woke you up?"

Arthur nodded.

The group went on to explain to Arthur what they had seen down there and how they had fought against a deadly king tier beast. After all, nearly all of them were there that day when fighting against it. But hearing this, Arthur had a saddened look on his face.

"From the sounds of it, when you guys arrived there were also no vampires present I see. It seems like the council has a lot to answer for what happened to my people." Said Arthur.

"I’m sorry, we don’t know much about it either." Silver said. "All we know is that the punishers no longer existed anymore after the civil war. We didn’t even know that the punishers side had won at the time and had chosen to leave. They made it sound like they had already killed you in battle. Let alone that you actually were peacefully living on another planet."

Something strange was going on, and Arthur could feel it. As if something more was going on in the current world. Perhaps more complicated than the one he left.

After the stories were finished being told, the group were told they were free to rest in the castle until the council would call them. It wasn’t like they had any other choice anyway. There were vampires everywhere and they knew humans were staying here as well.

As for Quinn, his group, and the others. They actually thought it was a good idea if they all slept in the same room. Right now they didn’t really feel safe on their own, including Silver and Fex, even if they didn’t want to admit it.

As sheets and mattresses were being taken from one room and put into another, Quinn had to ask a question that had been burning on his mind. "Vorden what the hell is that little thing on your shoulder? It’s been bugging me all day."

The little figure was still lying on its belly over Vorden’s shoulder, and it could be seen going up and down as it breathed in and breathed out.

Using his hand, Vorden lifted his head, and a sleepy mini Borden could be seen.

"Borden! What happened to him?" Quinn asked.

"Why don’t we talk about what happened to us while you were kicking that Vadeen leader’s arse," Vorden said.

Borden was still last asleep and hadn’t woken up, and the group decided to share stories of there battles they had. This was also fun for Erin to hear as she hadn’t seen them in a long time either. After everyone had finished telling them of their battles, they wanted to ask about Erin and Leo and how they had even met.

They also had explained what type of journey they had been on, how Erin was able to escape from Pure, and how Leo had helped her.

"You killed a high ranking number of Pure!" Layla said shocked, she looked at Leo and only just then she realized how strong he must have become. Her hands were shaking at the news. When her hands finally stopped shaking and she realized her old friend was now in front of her, She proceeded to give her a hug.

"It’s good to see you again," Layla said.

"You too," Erin replied.

As for Cia, she was happy to learn more about Pure, since Erin was treated like a new member, she could imagine what type of place it was. And she was kind of happy she didn’t remember, from the way Erin was explaining everything.

After everyone was done telling their stories and experiences, they had fallen into a deep sleep. All apart from Leo, and Silver that was. The two of them had decided to play guard duty. As they stood outside the door not saying a word to each other.

"Those kids. They’re so young to be going through things like this." Leo finally said.

"I wish.....I wish Fex could just enjoy his life with his friends..." Layla said.

And hearing these words, Leo smiled. Knowing he was next to a caring woman. An unknown amount of time had passed and Arthur walking the hallways spotted the two of them.

"It’s time." Said Arthur. "The council have asked to see everybody. They are to make their decision."
