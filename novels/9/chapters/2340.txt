Chapter 2341 ¬†An old face

There were small borders that were placed around the settlement. They weren't quite walls per se, but more like barriers, where there would be gates and a group of vampires that would stay as permanent guards.

This was because for the most part, the settlement was safe. There would rarely be attacks from beasts, and there were next to no attacks from the outside, but just in case, they did need to install safety precautions.

One of these precautions that had been installed were towers. There were several towers that were embedded with crystal energy and technology, and there were guards as well. The idea was that those in the towers could see if an attack was coming from afar, or if one was coming from above.

At the same time, the towers had large amounts of crystal energy that could be used to form a barrier, if there was some sort of attack from the outside or above. All of this was an especially automated system designed mostly by Vincent with the help of a few others.

It had been a while since the settlement had embraced his crazy ideas and work, and honestly he was happy about it. Vincent was enjoying his passion once more, without having to worry about the responsibilities of looking after the people or trying to run the place.

He had even thought about going into Eternal slumber himself, but wished to stay at least until everything was resolved and he was satisfied once again.

In one of the towers, there were two guards that were standing side by side, looking out in the distance, one of them was none other than Ronkin.

"Man, things sure have been quiet around here, even when we're not on tower duty, it's even quiet in the settlement lately." Another guard, who was a little chubby around the face and belly, named Bret said. "I know it has to be because of Quinn. Man, he's been doing a lot lately, so much that we don't even have to do anything. He's great don't you think?"

"Yeah." Ronkin smiled, thinking back to when his life was saved once more. Quinn was certainly a great guy, but he was unable to get enthusiastic about the conversation at hand. Because, there was something about Quinn's recent actions, it just didn't feel like him.

There were even times where Ronkin would wave, and although Quinn would wave back, it just didn't feel the same way. He wasn't quite sure if he was imagining it or not.

Of course, the detail of what Peter was currently doing was even kept from Ronkin. There was no telling who would find out, and when controlled what information could be passed on.

As the two continued to look out in the open, they didn't see anything, but a small beep was sounded in the tower behind them.

Ronkin went to have a look. In the centre of the tower there was a large terminal that looked more like a table. The outside was filled with a number of different controls. What Ronkin was looking at though, was the projected map.

It covered the settlement and more.

"Look at this, it's saying it is sensing an abnormal amount of energy in the forest." Ronkin pointed.

"It‚Ä¶ it looks like an attack!" Ronkin shouted, as he went and quickly slammed one of the buttons. If it was a false alarm then he would take the blame, but he would rather it be a false alarm than have "Could it be a beast attack?" Bret asked.

Ronkin shook his head, it didn't look like it, after all it was just a single area of energy. However, that quickly changed. From the single area of energy, multiple smaller energies seemed to be coming out. After that, it looked like more large energies like the first one were appearing from all over.

"It‚Ä¶ it looks like an attack!" Ronkin shouted, as he went and quickly slammed one of the buttons. If it was a false alarm then he would take the blame, but he would rather it be a false alarm than have people die, which was why he had acted instantly.

The alarm sounded all over the settlement, and the vampires that were at the gates including those inside, were aware that something was happening. Out through the forest that was not too far from the doorstep to the settlement, they could see it, charging though there looked to be groups of creatures coming out.

At first they looked like beasts but there was something slightly different about them.

-----

On the streets of the settlement, Peter and Muka had rushed out of their castle. Everyone was in motion as they wondered what was happening. As they ran through the streets though, they saw something strange.

Vampires, those that had familiar markings, and their familiars were coming out of the houses and the familiars were attacking not only their owner, but were also attacking those around them as well.

"Deal with the familiers, and keep an eye on all of those with a marking!" Muka shouted. "Make sure they are kept in an area, and have enough vampires supporting them if the familiars are to come back!"

Muka wanted to help those in the settlement, but she could feel it‚Ä¶ that there was something bigger going on up ahead. This wasn't just something small or simple happening, it was a full fledged attack. It didn't take long for them to reach one of the gates, and Muka was right on the mark.

The vampires, they were doing their best, as they threw out blood swipes, used beast weapons and continued on with their formations, but there were many.

'Is this related to Immortui, is this his doing? Can he really do something like this, or is it something else?'

Familiars, just like beasts, were all shapes and sizes, but they tended to have more tricky powers and abilities compared to beasts, and at the same time the regular familiars were smarter as well.

What they soon could see, breaking through the trees with heavy footsteps, was a large type of familiar. It looked like a giant rhino, as its horn stuck out right in front of it, startling at the settlement. It was kicking its legs in the ground, charging up and getting ready to run forward.

"Stop that, stop that from coming into the settlement at all costs!" The vampire guards shouted.

They started to use their weapons and blood aura, hitting the rhino familiar. When they hit its thick skin, it looked to have done nothing. The rhino charged forward and showed no signs of slowing down as it went towards the settlement.

It continued to run, until dropping out from the sky they all could see hope, the person who was going around the settlement solving all of their problems lately, Quinn.

He tensed his fist, and threw it out hitting the rhino right in the horn. Its whole head sunk and crashed into the ground, before it turned into nothing but particles, returning from where it once was.

"Hmm, that thing just looked big and strong, I thought it would be a lot stronger than that." Peter said.

The others behind cheered for the vampire leader, and they could feel a boost of morale consuming them all. With the strong leader by their side, showing feats like this, what trouble could they possibly face. REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

Muka appeared by Peter's side, and she noticed that he was looking deep into the forest.

"What are you looking at?" She asked.

"These familiars, they're coming through portals." Peter answered. "This‚Ä¶ it feels familiar‚Ä¶ I think I know this feeling."

Peter soon took off running ahead. On his way though, he decided to help out the settlement a little, as he would jump from side to side, delivering a punch, and defeating the familiars in a single hit. Each one of them was getting destroyed and with each one a loud cheer was heard.

Ronkin, who was watching from the settlement, was shaking his head.

'I'm sure of it‚Ä¶ that's not Quinn‚Ä¶ he hasn't even used his blood powers.' He thought.

Eventually, Peter and Muka had entered the forest but Peter had come to a sudden stop. He looked dead straight ahead and could see someone, or something, that he recognised.

"You‚Ä¶ you damn betrayer, what are you doing here, you stupid Boneclaw!" Peter yelled.
