Chapter 1084 - Assassination failed

It took a few seconds for the smile on the man’s face to disappear, as he realised that his hand had not only failed to pierce through Chris, but was also no longer part of his body. Right now, it was lying on the floor. Now all of his anger was aimed towards the one who had interfered in his assassination.

However, the moment they looked at the offending party, there were two things the assassin noticed straight away. Leo’s red eyes, as well as his smell. Both confirmed that he and the man were the same.

’No that’s not right,’ The man thought as he held onto the seared part of his hand. The blood flow was slowing down as he did his best to preserve himself, using what skills he had. ’The smell is slightly different.’

"What the hell is a Knight like you doing in a place like this?!" The vampire man demanded to know as he took a step back. He didn’t recognise what family he was from and since he had already defended Chris, it was apparent that they were not on the same side. As long as he was there, it was impossible for him to accomplish his mission, so he was looking for a way to escape.

"What are you idiots doing? Capture that traitor!" Chris shouted towards the other members of Pure who were all too startled at their companion having gone rogue.

Closing his eyes, Chris was trying to focus. He might have been exhausted but as the number one in Pure it should have been impossible for someone to get so close to him without him noticing. The important part now was to apprehend him, so they could find out more about the assassin.

Even in his weak state, it should have been impossible for a normal person to kill him with their b.a.r.e hands. His body was naturally hardened and trained beyond belief. The man must have had a trick up his sleeve, or at least known Qi. On top of that, he seemed to know Leo as well.

It was then, that Chris could tell, that the internal red energy inside of their bodies, of Leo and this one was the same.

’What the hell is going on? How come those guys with a different power source of Qi are popping up all over the place? If I remember the boy, it was quite infectious and rapid. Does this mean that not everyone who has the same Aura is on the same side? Things are getting pretty interesting.’

However, Leo was already in front of the man before anyone else had moved, his eyes were glowing red, as he stared directly into the man’s eyes. Leo intended to find out why the man had tried to assassinate Chris just now.

"You won’t get a thing from me!" The vampire said defiantly, he lifted his arm up, and without any hint of hesitation slit his own throat, deep enough so he died instantly on the spot as he fell to the ground creating a pool of blood.

’Did he know I was going to use my influence on him?’ Leo thought. ’It is clear that he was harbouring great secrets that he didn’t want anyone to find out about, but who was the one that sent the vampire? He didn’t seem to recognise me, so he must have been in the Human World for some time now. Was the one who had sent him someone from the thirteen families, perhaps the former King? ... or could it be that there is someone else out there?’

"Wait! That person seemed like he knew you! We have some questions you need to answer!" One of the Pure members attempted to stop him.

"Leave him be!" Chris interfered immediately. "He didn’t take my life when he had the chance and on top of that, he just saved me when one of my own already tried to kill me! Right now I trust him more than you." With that, Leo was gone.

’It looks like I owe you one, and I need to start being more careful about who is around me.’

"Why would Dillan do something like this? He’s been part of Pure for longer than I can remember." One the Pure members wondered out loud as they inspected the body.

’This must have something to do with that strange red Aura! Dillan didn’t have that red aura before. Or is it something else? I would have noticed it. Did it happen not long ago, does that mean there is someone who can pass on that aura? Things are certainly getting interesting.’ Chris thought with an intrigued smile on his face.

Moments after, the vampire’s face started to change from the Dillan they did regaonise, into someone they had no clue about.

"Let’s take that body with us, it’s clear that’s not Dillan." Chirs ordered.

Not long after, multiple sh.i.p.s with military personnel arrived at Zoo. They immediately began questioning the local populace as they tried to figure out what had happened. The information they received was the same from nearly everyone.

Upon entering the arena, they were quite surprised to find a four spiked Dalki’s body lying on the floor, with its head chopped clean off.

"We have discovered multiple sword marks on the body, a broken beast weapon that has been left behind. Ashes, and scorch marks across the floor, and finally the head of the deceased Dalki itself. From the looks of it, it was one clean strike that has separated it from its body." Jane reported as she stood by Oscar’s side in the arena.

"The head was chopped off in one clean strike? How many times have you seen that happen on a Dalki before?" Oscar asked.

"To our knowledge there are only two people who have reportedly defeated Dalki in such a way. One of them is the leader of Pure. We do not know his identity, but when Dalki had attacked certain areas we found them with their heads chopped off in this type of manner."

"We can only assume that it was the Pure leader themselves who have done that. The second was one of the Heroes of War, the Blind Swordsman." When saying those words that’s when she had figured something out. In the report, it had stated that someone with the appearance of the Bline Swordsman had participated in the event in the arena.

"Sir, I know what you are thinking, but do you really believe that the Blind Swordsman could have defeated a four spiked Dalki by himself?" Jane asked.

"No, I don’t. It is clear by the state of the area, that there were multiple people fighting, and the rest of the Cursed faction seem to be too far away at the moment. Continue the investigation here, and leave one of the generals to look after this place. The people should still be in shock after having been dragged into this mess."

Oscar ordered as he started to head back towards one of the sh.i.p.s.

’For a four spiked Dalki to suddenly appear here... we were lucky that the Blind Swordsman happened to be here at the same time. Otherwise who knows how many people would have died?’

’Would this have been something possible if it had happened in the first war? No, Quinn I don’t know what you and your people are doing, but keep doing it. We might need to rely on the Cursed faction a lot more from now on.’ Oscar thought.

"Sir, where are you going?!" Jane asked.

"This wasn’t the only four spiked Dalki. It’s clear now, the reason this man attacked by himself and why they didn’t bother sending any other forces with him. It’s because we have been underestimating their power. We have been told that Quinn Talen is going to help those on the Graylash sh.i.p.s defend against the invading attack." Oscar answered. "It seems like every world leader is taking responsibility and fighting apart from me. I’ve decided I need to go help Owen."

’We may have underestimated you, but it looks like you have done the same for us. This time, we will win this war!’ Owen thought, clenching his fist.
