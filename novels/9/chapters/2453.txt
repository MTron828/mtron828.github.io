Chapter 2454 Fight the Divine Brigade (Part 2)

Galen was already out on the field due to his fight with Minny, but he was able to quickly grasp the situation, and when he looked around, he decided to help his mother. He could see where she was struggling and why she was struggling.

With that, he had jumped up and used his shadow powers to stop the attack from hitting the crowd. Now that he was able to help his mother, she could focus on killing the Divine creatures.

"What about Minny?" Layla wondered.

"Minny is strong, you don't have to worry about her, kill this monster then save her!" Galen shouted.

Never did Layla think that she would be taking advice from her own son, yet here she was. The creature that was on the floor was hurt. Although they had strong attacks, it looked like their bodies weren't particularly hard.

As long as they got a good hit on them, they could finish them off. Jumping up in the air, she levitated her body and pulled on her bow once more. She fired three more arrows hitting the dark Divine a few more times, one in the head, the stomach and the legs.

Surprisingly, blood seemed to pour out of these creatures, although it wasn't red in colour. Instead it was golden. It looked a little strange especially on the Dark ones. Switching to her sword, she was ready to swing down on its neck to finish it off.

As she gathered her power, she flew towards its neck, and that was when several shots of golden energy came from the side. However, the attacks weren't aimed at her, instead it hit the dark Divine on the floor.

As it hit the body, its wounds healed almost instantly, and with the spear in its hand it swung it right at Layla. She braced herself with the sword blocking the attack, but was hit strongly in the air.

She managed to stop herself with her telekinesis powers before she was sent far from the scene, and she could already see the dark Divine standing up.

'What happened, did the golden creatures just attack the dark one?' Layla thought. 'But it didn't hurt it‚Ä¶ instead, I think it might have healed it.'

Layla's guess was spot on, it certainly seemed the case. Minny, fast with her movements, swung at one of the dark Divines. She clashed against the spear, and with her great strength she was able to push it back.

Then, when she saw an opening, she used her speed to run off the ground and slice, attacking the legs of the dark Divine. She cut it several times, to the point it had fallen over backwards.

She then sensed attacks coming from the side, coming from the other golden Divine. As the attacks hit the dark Divine, all the damage she had done so far had healed up.

With the dark Divines back in full swing and power, they were already on the assault once again.

Layla fell forward and swung her sword in the air with the spear of the dark Divine. She opened her mouth, and sprayed fire on its hands, trying to melt it. It let go of the spear with one hand, and a golden shot came over, healing it.

It then let go of the spear with the other, and did the same. With a burst of strength, it pushed and Layla was pushed back once again.

"We need to deal with the golden ones first!" Layla shouted, projecting her voice again. "They can heal the others."

She wasn't sure if it was vice versa or not, since the golden Divines had yet to be hurt, but judging by the fact that they were avoiding being hit, and weren't as aggressive as the dark ones, she judged this to most likely be their role.

"We're trying!" Andy shouted back. "But they're too fast, we can't do anything."

Looking at the situation, Layla was trying to think of a strategy, how could they win this fight? If this continued on in a loop, they would just tire out, and if that was to happen they would quickly lose this fight.

It was strange their powers weren't overwhelmingly strong, but they were powerful enough to give them trouble. Yet when together, if felt like an unstoppable opponent they had to face.

"Think Layla, think!"

She continued to fire her arrows, trying her best to distract the dark Divine before it could do a full scale attack like before. Thankfully, most of the vampires looked like they had already evacuated as well. ChùíÜ√™ck out lùíÇtùíÜst ùíèùíêvùíÜlùíî on novùíÜl/bin(.)cùíêm

Which meant that she didn't have to worry about Galen as much either.

'Wait that's it, Galen.'

"Everyone, on my mark, get ready to focus all of your energy on the Dark ones!" Layla shouted.

Andy heard loud and clear, as they continued to dodge the attacks. They were finding no opportunity to harm the golden ones anyway. So they thought if all of them put their attention into the dark ones, this could work.

However, Layla had a lot more planned than that.

"Galen, Minny!" Layla shouted. "When you hear me shout, hide, I want you to hide those golden ones!"

Both Minny and Galen nodded, as they understood the meaning behind the words. At the right time, Layla flew backwards and fired several more arrows, using as much Qi as she could.

They spread out and hit both of the spears hard on the dark Divines. She then went straight to the ground, and slammed her hands on the floor.

Out in the arena, several black balls started to sprout up all over.

"Now!" Layla shouted.

With her telekinesis powers, all of the black balls went straight towards the dark Divines. With how large their bodies were, it was almost impossible for them to escape. As the balls touched their body, the spirit chains were appearing all over, locking them in place.

Immediately, The Graylash vampires, Jessica, and Andy went straight at the dark Divines. Andy had grown out both of his hands, making them gigantic, lifting them in the air.

"Hide!" Layla shouted. Switching from her sword she went to the bow again, and aimed toward the dark beings. She was exhausted but she needed to push herself, they needed to get through this.

At the same time, both Galen and Minny held out their hands, and pointed them toward the golden warriors, a shadow portal appeared and the golden beings had disappeared into the shadow space.

With how much power these creatures held, who knew how long they would stay in there. This wasn't the power of Quinn's shadow after all, but just his children. Still, it only needed to work for a few moments.

A bombardment of attacks from all sides, with all their strength, was unleashed on the two dark Divines. Soon their bodies fell to the ground, and as they hit the floor, they burst into nothing but gold dust, disappearing in front of their eyes.

"We‚Ä¶ did it." Jessica said with a smile.

At that moment, breaking out from the shadow spaces, appearing on the field, were the two gold Divines.

"No‚Ä¶ we just did half the job." Andy said. "Let's finish the rest."
