Chapter 1026 - A condition

Outside on the field after getting their reports from the students, they were the first ones that had been sent back to the school base located on Earth. Their treatment wouldn’t stop there.

They knew there was more work that needed to be done, not just treating physical injuries but it was important for the students to recover mentally as well. Seeing your friends and fellow pupils die in front of your eyes wasn’t something every single person could cope with in the same way.

Oscar had remained out on the field with a few other soldiers who were taking the Dalki bodies in for research. His reasons for staying were the same for the Cursed faction members who continued to stand in the heat.

A ping came in on Jane’s tablet, Oscar’s assistant who was standing right next to him.

"The reports have come in from the Shelter and Head General Samantha, would you like to read them?" Jane asked, since Oscar for once was seemingly doing nothing.

Whenever she saw him like this, she would remind him that there was always work to be done around the place.

After giving it a detailed read, Oscar was quite surprised about what the reports said.

’In the report, Samantha makes note of the teacher Fex using string abilities and a strange red aura as well. The aura that is described is almost exactly the same as what Innu described, and the same as what I saw Quinn do previously.

’Also, it states that there were other shadow users in the Cursed faction. This red aura that keeps getting mentioned, it seems to be quite powerful. It seems like Quinn isn’t just hiding one or two things but is holding more cards then he has let on. This could be a problem.’ Oscar thought. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The reaction that Quinn was seeing after what he had said was not what he had expected. Throughout the whole conversation, he was the one on the back foot and Eno was the calm, all knowing one. However, now it seemed like he didn’t know every single little thing that was going on in the world.

For a brief second, and it was only once, his heart beat had beaten out of sync from the regular pattern it had before.

’I realise now, in my head I was building up Richard Eno to be this untouchable God pulling the strings on everything that was happening, but now I see that’s not the case at all. He is just another person.’ Quinn thought.

"You have just provided me with additional information that I did not know about before." He admitted. "You seem to have been more valuable than I realised, and now there are questions I even want to ask you. You keep surprising me even after I have raised my expectations. I hope you can continue to do that.

"Because of this, I will grant you to ask one more question." Eno said.

It was already a head scratcher coming up with the last question, perhaps he could ask where Eno really was, but he could always move after that happened. Or he could ask why the Dalki have decided to attack now and here.

Thinking about what to ask, Quinn started to think about the students, and that led him to think about one more person.

’How could I forget? He has waited long enough and has done so much for us.’

"I know what I want to ask. There is a boy with me that you might know, he goes by the name Sil. His situation is a little... complicated." Quinn went on to explain the details of what happened to Sil, not the full story but just enough for him to know what he needed.

"Yes, I actually know a lot about the Blade family." Eno replied. "What did you want to ask, did you want to know if I knew a way to bring back the other two?"

Quinn nodded.

"I do know, but remember I said you could ask three questions, not three favours and this would be a favour if I were to help you with this, wouldn’t you agree?" Eno suggested. "If you wish for me to help, then I have a favour I need in return."

Watching carefully, the Cursed members were starting to sweat buckets with the hot sun scorching them. They hadn’t moved and just looked out in the desert waiting for Quinn.

"Can’t they upgrade these rings a little?" Nate asked, playing with his finger. "Maybe make something that can also make the heat not affect us."

"We are all experiencing the same thing, Nate." Sam said. "And you don’t hear us complaining. Why don’t you just imagine that a girl is waiting on the other side of that dune for you, then you would stand there for hours."

A few seconds later, two black portals opened in the distance and they could see Quinn emerge.

"It looks like Quinn didn’t need my help after all." Peter said.

When Quinn moved closer, Oscar was happy to know that he looked to be fine. He actually had a lot he wanted to ask Quinn. That’s when he noticed that he wasn’t alone and a strange man was standing next to him, it was someone that Oscar didn’t recognise.

The others wanted to run up to Quinn, but didn’t as Oscar was the one who walked forward first and Sam had stopped the others rushing up, to remind them that Oscar was a world leader. Besides, they were just happy that Quinn seemed to be fine.

"Quinn, a lot has happened here today and it’s because of you so many people could have survived." Oscar congratulated him. "We have to have a party in your honour to celebrate."

"A party, for what happened?" Quinn replied back, not really understanding what a party would be intended for. People had died at the end of the day.

"Quinn, I think it would be good to celebrate. There are many things to be pleased about and the people need a break before they hear what is about to be announced." Oscar said. "I think your days of being a teacher will be over, so it would be nice to celebrate your time here. Most importantly, it is to announce the achievement of getting a first victory against the Dalki before war is declared."

Meeting Richard Eno, Quinn had kind of forgotten what had happened since he was blaming Richard for everything. But if it really wasn’t Richard’s doing moving the Dalki, it meant that this was the first official attack from them.

The whole world would soon find out about this and when war was declared, all factions and groups would be on the move just like before when Quinn was a kid.

"If it’s something that has to be done. You can organise it with Sam later." Quinn said.

"Yes, you deserve rest, feel free to go back to the others, but before you go, I don’t want to be rude. Do you mind introducing me to the person next to you?"

Quinn looked at Eno and was wondering what to say about him, but he didn’t have to, because Eno stood forward himself and gave a bow.

"I believe you may know me, but have never met me. My name is Richard Eno." He said bowing down, and walking off with Quinn.

’Richard Eno!’ Oscar shouted in his head, even Jane nearly dropped her tablet. Richard Eno was a man everyone was searching for, just as much as they were searching for Jack Truedream but no one could find him, and now he was right there in front of him. The question was, why was he with Quinn? Had Richard Eno been with him the whole time? What was their relationship?

All sorts of questions were running through Oscar’s mind, but they had already left and the moment was lost to ask.

When Quinn arrived with Richard by his side, everyone stared at him like he was insane. They could tell it was a vampire standing by Quinn’s side due to his smell, and they could also guess who he was.

"It’s nice to meet you all, I’m sure we will all get to know each other quite well." Richard said.

"Erhh Quinn, what does he mean by that?" Peter asked, unafraid and ignoring Richard.

"This is Richard Eno, and he will be staying with us on the Cursed ship for a while." Quinn said.

On the condition of helping out Sil, Quinn was to grant Eno a favour back, and he had asked to observe the Cursed faction.
