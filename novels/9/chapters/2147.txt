Russ' ability was incredibly strong, but from the beginning since he had it, there was always something he struggled with, and that was estimating how many MC cells would be required to use his ability.

When using his powers, it often depended on the other person's mind, how strong the image was of their skills or their powers. The stronger the image of power they had, the stronger Russ was and the more MC cells it would use.

There were times when they thought of themselves as weaker than they actually were, which would put Russ in a difficult position, those that had an accurate representation of themselves and those that overvalued themselves as well.

Because of all these reasons, even if Russ had seen the power in question and the level of strength they had, it was still hard for him to guess just how many MC cells would be used, especially if they were hiding a big part of their strength.

At the moment, not only was Russ completely transformed as Stark, he was now summuning another person from his mind, Jun. When going against Quinn it was possible for him to do things like this such as summoning the large dragon, but back then he had external help which he no longer had, which was why he needed to be careful.

It was also the reason why he had pulled out this second trump card, only during the last 20 seconds.

"Is this cheating‚Ä¶ did the Dark Red's just teleport Jun to help him out."

"Yeah, that would be considered cheating right? Even if he has the power to teleport people, if they are using another person on that team that would be cheating!"

The people who were watching were starting to complain, but soon on the screen an image appeared and there was subtitle underneath.

[This is the live feed of the Dark Reds team]

It showed that the Dark Reds were all still there, intently watching the screen and were just as shocked about what was happening as them. Now, they really didn't understand what exactly was Russ' power.

'If I take part in things, I don't take part in them with the intention of losing!' Russ thought, as he concentrated on pressing all the buttons on one side. At the same time, his helper, Jun, was touching buttons on the other side.

The points were catching up, and eventually they had surpassed the score of Stark.

Watching it, the Dark Reds team were cheering Russ on.

"That alien, he never did this during the training!" The coach shouted. "He's as sly as Jun with his tricks."

"I knew there was a reason why I liked him." Jun stated, rubbing his nose, proud that his plan was working and bringing these two onto the team.

While watching the screen, the timer went down to the last 10 seconds, and that's when Quinn noticed it again.

'Russ you did well‚Ä¶ but I don't think you're going to win this one.' Quinn thought. While they were hitting the buttons Quinn noticed that Stark looked at the scoreboard once again, and it almost boosted him into another gear.

He was moving faster and faster. There was always something in the back of Quinn's mind. If with the help of all his blood hands he was unable to beat Stark then that meant, the speed that he could move at, would have to be immeasurable and that was exactly what was happening now.

*BEEP

"THE GAME IS OVER!" The announcer shouted.

Immediately Russ stopped, his body turning back to what it was, and the Jun that he created was starting to disappear. The camera made sure to catch this and the Dark Reds' room, so there would be no complaint from the others.

Still, they felt like they would have to explain themselves at some point, and Russ would no doubt have to show his power again. When Russ had finished going back to his normal self, he looked at the scoreboard with a smile that quickly dropped.

"How‚Ä¶ What is this? How did I lose?" Russ shouted with anger, fully expecting to win.

The crowd seeing the scores on the big screen erupted with huge cheers. Stark hadn't just beaten Russ, he had done so with a clear victory of a 100 points, and breaking a new record

The King and Queen of the Penswi watching this had a great smile on their face as they clapped.

"This is truly entertaining, just how much can Stark improve!" The King exclaimed.

"He is certainly the hero of our people. Even now, when he is going up against his toughest challenge, he has risen to the occasion. I must remember to thank and meet these aliens who have been able to improve Stark and show us just what we are capable of." The Queen stated.

It was extremely frustrating for Russ, after expecting a sweeping victory seeing the smiling faces of all the people, and turning his head he could see quite the cocky smile on Stark as well.

Now he was understanding how Jun felt, Russ wanted Stark to have this feeling right now, and he wanted to witness the face he pulled. In the end, there was nothing else he could do, but head back to his team.

"Hey, don't look so angry, alien! You were amazing!"

"Yeah, where are you from, are all aliens like you, can they turn into us?"

The crowd were encouraging Russ, because they truly cared about those that were fast, even if it wasn't someone of the same race, and it was safe to say that Russ had made quite a few fans.

Either way, Russ wasn't quite in the mood.

"Stupid aliens, just gawking at me like that. At least they know when to appreciate a strong person." Russ mumbled and continued walking forward.

When he arrived back with the rest of the team, the group wanted to say something to him, but Russ just sat down, almost sulking with his arms crossed.

"Its okay." Jun stated. "In the first place, for the Dark Reds to win, we needed to come in second and first place, then our group will have enough points with my first position as well."

What this meant of course was it all rode on Quinn.

"My fellow friend." The coach said with big sparkling eyes. "There is a lot of pressure on you, for someone who is not even from our planet, can you do it?"

Quinn pulled an awkward face. This pressure, this was no pressure at all compared to the number of things he had gone through, and if he lost it wasn't a big deal. He was sure that Russ had done enough to get the attention of the King and Queen.

If they asked for a meeting it was more than likely that they would get it.

"I will try my best, that's all I can do." Quinn answered which didn't exactly give confidence in the others, but he was always like this.

"Hey!" Russ shouted out. "You better win this one. I want to see the face of that guy when he loses, and if you lose, I'll beat your arse!"

It was the first time Quinn had heard Russ speak in such a way, because he was usually quite the calm person.

"Hahah, sure sure. I mean you are always free to try and fight me if you want." Quinn replied. "That would be quite a spectacle for the Penswi to watch as well, don't you think.

"Anyway, just like you, I have no intention of losing." Quinn answered.

While waiting the last event was announced and it was called the king of tag. A game that Quinn didn't really practise but it was because the rules were simple.

Contestants would start at the edge of the ring and from the centre a sticky device would come up. The contestant was to stick that device on a visible part of their body.

There was a 5 minute time limit, and when the game ended, the last one with the device would be declared the winner.

It was time for Stark to face off against Quinn.
