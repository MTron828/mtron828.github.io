It had become quite clear that like Laxmus, Magnus was also under the control of Immortui. For whatever reason, these two were doing the bidding of the celestial that even the Ancient Ones feared, so much so that they locked Immortui away to another plane, one not directly linked to the one on Earth.

Without meaning to, Quinn and his friends had managed to kill nearly all of the dedicated followers of Immortui that were causing great chaos, Quinn had even removed the marking that was originally on the black sword and replaced it with his own.

Ultimately, a portal had been opened to the other plane, but once again it was closed by Quinn. So then why, why did Magnus tell Jared to make sure the Talen family lived, wouldn't it make more sense that he wanted them dead.

"Did Magnus ever give you a reason?" Quinn asked.

Jared shook his head.

"Not quite, but there were some strange things. He would often ask me questions about Minny, but when he found out that she was adopted and wasn't biologically related to you, he stopped.

"I have no clue why he asked to keep your family alive."

The original leaders were amazed that Immortui, the god that made them become vampires, was interested in Quinn, but they felt it was only right after knowing what power he had.

Thinking about Quinn, a thought came to Hikel's mind.

"Weren't you the one that originally created that item, the red heart?" Hikel asked. "We learned a bit about what happened when we were under Jim. He updated us on the situation and talked about sealing off the portal. If we replace the deeds he told us he did with you, then I assume you were the actual one that created what was known as the red heart."

The originals were in eternal sleep, so when they were awoken, Jim informed them that he was the current leader of the vampire settlement, while explaining all of the feats he had achieved.

This was backed up by Muka who had her memory changed as well as everyone else, so the story fit for them.

"Maybe it's not just you, but your family that is able to open up a portal to where he is. If you or your family died, then he would have no way of opening up a portal."

This reminded Quinn of why Mundus had locked him up in the first place. He had been told that he had a strong link to Immortui, and while he was alive, there was a way for Immortui to get out.

What if he had figured out a way to do so without Quinn but just members of his family. It would mean Galen was in danger or at least a target.

'I thought the link was only the case as while I was a celestial like him, but if that's not the case maybe it's still possible. Mundus is just honouring our deal.'

The three continued to ask Jared questions about Magnus, in hopes they might have known where he had gone. If his goal was Galen or Quinn, then he would still have to be close. They had received a list of locations, but they were all places that they had already checked over, before even questioning Jared.

"Thank you for all your help so far, you have given us a lot of great information." Quinn said, his eyes starting to glow red.

"There are just two more questions I need to ask you. Did you answer all of the questions today to the full extent of your knowledge and truthfully?"

"Yes." Jared answered clearly under the influence skill. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

This was a sigh of relief for Quinn, the last thing he wanted to do was to have someone a little bit older than Minny, be an enemy of some sort.

"I'll need to do a full search of your body. I know you said the marks were temporary that you drew on yourself, but we just need to see if there are any permanent ones. The search was done and they were unable to find anything.

As soon as the search was done, Hikel had an odd look on his face, as he heard something being sent through his head.

"Ergg Quinn, apparently your daughter is outside, asking for you and she says it's urgent." Hikel said.

Quinn, hearing the words urgent, placed everyone there in his shadow space. After that he used shadow link, and appeared right behind Minny, letting everyone out of the shadow space.

"What's the emergency, Minny, is everything okay!" Quinn said, looking around. He noticed they were in the entrance way of the tenth castle. They were all standing on a red rug that split off into two ways and went up a large staircase to reach the second floor.

There didn't seem to be any attack going on. There were just the guards of the castle near Minny, and standing by her side a slightly taller older girl, it was Hebe.

The two girls immediately spotted Jared at the back, his face was pale and a little red. He looked flustered, but it was mainly because he had just been searched naked in front of the other original leaders, which was somewhat embarrassing of itself.

"No, don't!" Hebe shouted. "You can't take Jared, you can't kill him, he did nothing wrong, and even if he did‚Ä¶ he's a good vampire, he's a good person. He always even looked out for Minny on the side."

"Daddy, please don't kill Jared, I don't know him very well but he kept Minny's secret, so I think he's a good person." Minny said.

"Not think‚Ä¶ he is a good person!" Hebe continued to shout.

The leaders had to take a step back due to all of the shouting, they were confused at what was going on.

"Guys relax." Jared spoke up. "They're not here to kill me, they just wanted to ask me some questions, that was all. None of you should be talking to the leaders like this, especially Quinn."

Hebe knew he was right, but how was she supposed to react?

"You mean they're not going to kill you? Then why did they suddenly put that bag over your head and drag you away!"

Edvard slapped the top of his forehead loudly after hearing that.

"My men did that, right in front of you? I'm sorry, they must have given you quite a scare. It was no wonder you thought they were going to kill your friend."

It was a complete misunderstanding and Edvard felt like it was his fault. Letting Jared come through he ran over and gave Hebe a big hug.

"Thanks for always looking out for me, but you worry a bit too much." Jared said.

Hebe was crying and one would suspect that their relationship was more than just friends by the drastic reaction. After a long hug, the two let go, and Jared looked at Minny.

"I can't believe that you even went through all the trouble to get Minny to try and convince her father, and you‚Ä¶"

Jared went to about eye level, squatting down on his knees to look at Minny.

"I can't believe you were ready to try to convince your father, thank you." Jared said.

His hands raised up, and a dark red glow filled his eyes. In an instant his hand had conducted a strong condensed form of blood aura, all to one point in his finger, going right toward Minny's head.

"What do you think you're doing?" Quinn said, as he held onto Jared's hand, stopping the finger from hitting Minny's head, less than a centimetre away.

Quinn immediately pulled Jared away from Minny, and held him by his throat as he slammed him against the wall. The wall cracked but Quinn held back his strength so Jared wouldn't die nor would he go through the wall.

He glanced at his right hand, and in the palm, the symbol of Immortui could be seen.

"What are you doing!" Hebe shouted. "You just said he was fine!"

Both Edvard and Hikel stopped the two girls.

"Stop, your friend, just attempted to take Minny's life."
