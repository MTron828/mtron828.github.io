The vampire settlement had received a surprise visit from none other than the Mermerials. With the way things were going, it wasn't so much of a problem for them, apart from a single young elder. One that went by the name Xoxy. 

He had been aggravating Layla for a while now, constantly asking questions about Quinn, while trying to undermine the rest of the work and courtesy that they had been putting out. Eventually though, it seemed that the Elder had been acting strangely for a reason. 

Learning from the other Elders, they now knew that Xoxy was actually here on behalf of a mission from the old celestial of the Mermerials, Yongbu. A desperate attempt was made as Layla went searching everywhere for him, fearing that the celestials could be targeting her and her family again. 

She already had a lot to worry about with Immortui and what was happening with Quinn, but without Quinn here, it was her job to protect the family. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After using all the resources that she had at her fingertips, and with Muka's help, they were unable to come up with anything. It was as if the Mermerial elder had suddenly vanished, been taken out of thin air. 

Returning to the castle, and her room, she went on the search for Galen, fearing that he could be in trouble as well. Galen had appeared, and out of his shadow, a vampire popped out, one that looked awfully familiar, almost like that of the Mermerial elder. 

"It's you!" Layla shouted out. "You're the Mermerial Elder… but why do you look like that?" 

It was clear now, with the disguise this person had, they were up to no good. With her hand stretched out, she used her telekinesis powers to pull Xox up into the air, and wrapped her fingers around his throat.

"If I open my mouth, I can create flames that are strong enough to melt metal. So if you are wearing some type of mask, I'm sure it will melt it off, but I doubt your head would survive that in the first place." Layla said.

Dark balls started to appear in the room, and they were surrounding Xox. If he made any sudden movements or tried to break free, then his body would hit one of the dark balls, creating the shadow chains that would hold him in place. She didn't want to let this little rat escape from his hands. 

"So, I want you to speak, and I need to hear the truth right from your mouth, why are you here, why were you searching for Minny, and why did Galen stop you."

Galen quickly jumped, and now was on the side of his mother standing beside her. That's when Xox could see that Galen had a large smile on his face, he was smirking at the tough situation he was in at the moment. 

'You little brat… what the heck did I do to you!' Xox thought. 'This was meant to be a simple job… now I know what Yongbu meant when he said that his family is crazy, and this woman, she doesn't seem weak either.' 

Xox was trying to think of a way out of the situation. As a celestial, he could just go back and enter the celestial space as an escape. He wouldn't have to stay there for an incredibly long time before he would be out of the current situation, but stay there long enough and it would be fine. 

The major issue though was returning. If he returned, then no doubt the Ancient One would ask him what information he had found. Right now, he still had no clue where Quinn was, or to say anything, apart from information about the brat, but would that be enough?

The wrath of the Ancient Ones was too great in his mind, so he decided to try and use his sweet talking mouth to get out of the current situation. 

'I have talked to many of the celestials, even swindling them and getting great deals out of all of them. If I can't talk myself out of this situation, then what have I been doing with all my time.' 

Xox recomposed himself and looked Layla right in the eye. He lifted both of his hands up by his side as if he was surrendering. 

"First, I want to tell you, I really didn't mean any harm." Xox said. "I am not a strong individual. Even your son was strong enough to overpower me. I wouldn't even think about doing anything to the vampire settlement. 

"As you said, I can disguise myself and I thought it was easier to walk around as a vampire because I wanted to get more information." 

Layla started to grip a little tighter with her hand around his throat, and was channelling her Qi. The energy could be felt and Xox was a little worried that even if he used celestial energy, then this person would still be able to overpower him. 

"I just wanted to know about Quinn!" Xox exclaimed. "It was Yongbu, he wanted me to find Quinn and apologise to him, but it seemed like you were hiding something. Every time I asked you a question about him you would avoid it. 

"So I decided to try and get answers from your family, I thought if I asked them, they might tell me where Quinn is, that's the truth!"

As Layla had her hands grasped around Xoxy's neck, she was feeling his pulse, and she was also reading his emotions. Trying to tell if he was lying or not. It was quite hard for her. He was either an excellent liar, or what he was saying was mostly the truth.

There were a few times where she could tell his emotions would change slightly. 

'If I could have my own way, then the best thing to do would be to kill him. Then I know that my family will be safe no matter what, but if he really is working for the celestial, then it will cause us problems. 

'Quinn said he made a deal with them, to not get involved, but I guess they can't control every individual celestial's actions. So if I was to get us into trouble, then it could cause the celestials to keep a closer eye on us, and they might find out where Quinn is.' 

All of this were the thoughts going through Layla's mind, but that was if everything Xox said was true. 

"Please, if you release me, then I promise that I'll just leave this place, leave with the Mermerials, that's what you want, right?" Xox said, as he could tell her grip was weakening, he just needed to persuade her a little more, and then he could be free. 

"Alright, call him." Layla said. 

"Huh?" Xox raised an eyebrow. 

"If you really want to make up with us, then Yongbu can come down here himself, I know celestials can teleport themselves. Tell him I give him permission to come here. He can't meet Quinn, but meeting his wife should be enough. Tell him to come here, and talk to me to my face… I'm waiting." Layla said. 

Nervous, now Xox had to rely on Yongbu. Would he even help him out in the situation he was in… it was hard to say, but he had no choice, and if they were caught in the act, or Yongbu revealed something, it might mean they had a big fight on their hands, it would be good to have him by his side if that happend.
