Chapter 990 - Activating new power

In the beast class, Erlen and Zhen seemed to be having a disagreement about something. Shiro had confidently walked up to the walls and went ahead, grabbing a pair of dual short blades. One held in each hand and walked to the centre of the room where everyone had already spread out.

To Zhen, it was clear that he had accepted his challenge, and he too decided to ignore the warning given and walked out to the centre of the room. There was no officiator, no ref for this fight, just a match between students who were using beast weapons.

"Hey, don’t you think we should try to find a teacher or something? This could go bad. There is no one here to stop the fight if anything happens?" Venus asked.

Venus was with Swin as usual, and the two of them looked around the room to see if anyone else was going to get a teacher. At the same time, they were worried if they left, that things might just get out of hand, and backup from the two of them was needed.

"If anything happens to Shiro, we have to back him up like he did for us at that time," Swin replied.

Pulling out his own sword from his sheath. Zhen held it in his hand. It was made with good quality materials. The hilt’s beast parts showed that it was most likely an intermediate weapon. Compared to all the basic tier weapons that had been placed on the wall, this was quite an achievement, as it meant that this was Zhen’s own proposal weapon he had brought in.

The swords were something between that of a short sword and a longsword. Not too heavy, but still carried decent range ready to be held in both hands for extra power, or a single hadn’t for more options and flexibility.

Activating the beast weapon, new energy was felt moving into his body. He was now stronger than before. Activating a beast weapon to be used to its full potential and gain its stats didn’t always show a sign.

However, some weapons would light up when active. They even had beast training balls that would change colour once they sensed the person had activated them already.

Seeing the weapon in Zhen’s hand, Shiro’s confidence swayed a little, but he gripped both of his swords tightly and knew he had to have confidence in himself.

After meeting with Quinn and Sil, Shiro’s opinion did change a little. He no longer worried about which weapon would suit the ability he would get, and just tried using the best weapons or weapons he could at the time, and that’s when he had found the dual swords.

Activating two of them gave a slightly better boost compared to other weapons, and although the strength given when using them wasn’t much, the speed made up for it.

The fight had begun, and Zhen was seen walking up confidently to Shiro as if he didn’t have to worry about a single thing.

"Let me show you the difference between our class and yours. There is a big difference between us. We know how to use the active skills in our weapons. This alone gives us a huge advantage." Zhen said, using his top speed to dash towards Shiro.

To the students watching, this was impressive, and it was the first time those from Quinn’s class had seen a beast weapon fully active.

’This is how much speed one can gain from beast weapons?’ A student asked but was more amazed at the same.

However, when Zhen got close and swung his sword, sharp fast and confidently, what he didn’t expect was it to be blocked by one; of shirts swords, and before Zhen knew it, the other hand that was free and had a sword, was swung at his side hitting him against his armour.

Even though he was wearing armour, the strength of the strike hurt him, and Zhen couldn’t help placing his hand over where he had been hit.

"You lied. You already know how to activate your best weapon." Zhen complained, still holding onto his side.

"I never said that we didn’t know how to activate the power of the beast weapon."

Hearing Shiro’s reply, they had an idea of what had happened. Although Zhen had activated his, and he should have had more power and strength, so did Shiro, allowing him to block the attack and hold it.

"You," Zhen said, placing his other hand free forward. "Do you know why I only hold my weapon in one hand? It’s so I can still use my ability.

Before Shiro could move, he felt something wrapping around his arms and legs. Soon he couldn’t move at all. The vines wrapped around his arms tightened until he eventually dropped both swords, no longer being able to use them.

"I’m really going to enjoy this," Zhen said, with the same smile he always had. Throwing out his fist, he had the sword guard covering his knuckles and hit Shiro right in the face giving him a bloody nose.

"Hey, stop, what are you doing!" Venus ran out, and so did Swin straight behind him.

He ignored their words and didn’t even care if they were about to interrupt. Shiro looked almost unresponsive, but when Zhen threw another fist until it was eventually stopped by Erlen himself. Holding onto his arm, it started to freeze quite quickly.

"You need to stop!" Erlen said.

"What the hell are you doing?" Zhen asked. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"I’m protecting you. I’m protecting all of us. Please just stop hitting these students." Erlen pleaded.

Zhen looked into his eyes for a few seconds, and he could see worry. This person who is this strong was worried about something, but what were they worried about?’ He thought.

Because of this, Zhen decided to stop, letting his ability go and dropping Shiro to the floor.

"I guess there is no need for us to show you anything," Zhen said, walking back to the others. "You already have someone that knows how to activate beast weapons, so why don’t you ask him?"

Soon, all five of them had left the room, and Shiro was left there on the floor. A busted lip, probably a broken nose and a few ribs, with only Venus and Swin by his side.

The students didn’t really know what to do or what to say to Shiro, but they actually thought for a brief second when Shiro had gotten the first strike in, they had a chance, but it all quickly vanished.

"Come on, we have to take him to the medical room," Venus said, lifting him up on his back.

"Let’s go," Swin replied.

Just as the two of them, along with Shiro on their backs, were about to exit the room, the door had opened, and the first teacher to walk in was teacher Aden, but the one that followed him was general Hardy.

"Hardy, your back!" Venus said with a smile.

For Quinn, he couldn’t; keep his eyes off the injured person who was on Venus’s back. The main thing was the smell that was coming off his body. Even a single drop, he knew the student was bleeding.

What shocked him was seeing that it was Shiro who had been beaten once again, but he was in a worse condition than before.

"Venus, take him to the doctor’s office and have Hayley heal his wounds," Quinn ordered. "As for the rest of you, I want you to tell me what happened now."

Hearing everything, Quinn wasn’t angry. He was more upset with himself due to allowing things to happen while he was away. He wondered what to do. There was a big event coming up, and his class was at the bottom of the barrel.

However, what he was most concerned about, was that Shiro had been beaten up a second time.

’Didn’t everything end with that last event? I guess there is more than one rotten apple.’

’I can’t do what I did last time and get too involved like that. Clearly, it hasn’t helped Shiro as he is still being bullied. I need to come up with something, so none of those in my class gets hurt." Quinn thought.
