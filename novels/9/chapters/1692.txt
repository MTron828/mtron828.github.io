‚ÄãChapter 1693: Teacher...

When arriving, there were a few extra faces that Quinn could see that he didn't quite recognise, but the fact that they weren't outright fighting each other, Quinn had quickly accepted them as allies.

There were a lot of questions on his mind, especially since he could see Muka there, but it looked like everyone was in a tricky situation and already was following the middle-aged black-haired man into the spaceship.

That's definitely Muka, without a doubt. If one of the vampire leaders is alive, then maybe I can ask her some questions about what happened to the others. I wanted to ask Fex, but it was best to keep his time short. Besides, it seemed like he went down another path away from them. Quinn thought.

Once everyone was on board, it was time for the ship to start and head off. While waiting for this, quite a few people couldn't wait to talk to Quinn, and their eyes hadn't left him.

"Quinn!" Muka, Jessica, and Vorden all said at the same time. Immediately, they looked at each other, and there seemed to be a few sparks in the air.

"I have been waiting to see his majesty for so long. I thought he would never come back, now is my chance to talk to him. What could these two possibly say that would be of importance?" Muka thought.

"I have to thank him... I have to thank Quinn... I didn't even know who he was. Is this all real?"

"I still can't believe it, but while in that cell, I thought if I ever get to see him another day, I have to tell Quinn. I have to tell him how much he changed my life." Jessica thought.

While the two girls were thinking this, they could see the middle-aged dark-haired man continue to walk forward towards Quinn and immediately go to embrace him with a hug.

Being a little on guard lately, due to the new people he was constantly meeting and somewhat had been hostile towards him, Quinn took a step back, avoiding the hug.

"Ah, I'm so sorry, Quinn." The man bowed down on the ground with his head down.

"Quinn. I was just so happy to see you, and I never thought I would get this chance again. Teacher... Teacher, it's been so long... You changed my life, and I was trying to find you... I knew you would still be alive..that's why... that's why-"

It was a strange sight for everyone to see, this middle-aged man was suddenly breaking down in tears like a child and his voice changed, making him seem like a completely different person.

Still, Quinn was unable to recognise them. Eventually, they looked at Quinn, wiping their tears away on their sleeve.Follow the latest novels ùíêùíè nùíê/velbin(.)com

"Sorry, of course, you won't recognise me, this body is old, and it's not even mine in the first place. It's Shiro."

"You might not even remember much, but I was a pupil of yours. We went into Owen's mind together and..."

Before Shiro could finish his sentence, Quinn had hugged him tightly.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry I didn't recognise you. Of course, I remembered you, Shiro. You did so much for us back then, even though you were just a child, even younger than I was, and I can't imagine how much you have been through."

"There has to be a reason why your mind is still conscious in another body after all of these years. You probably thought you needed to do more... I'm so sorry you couldn't just live a peaceful life."

Hearing all of these words, Shiro's tears kept on falling on the back of Quinn's clothes. He wanted to say so much, and he had always kept up a brave face being a part of the Blade family, but he didn't even know where to start.

Pushing Quinn away, Shiro wiped his tears once again. "It's not fair for me... it's not fair that I'm the only one that gets to enjoy your return, Quinn."

"There is someone else, someone else that has been waiting for you to come back just as long as I have."

Shiro closed his eyes, and when opening them again, the air around him had changed once more.

"Damn." Were the first words out of his mouth.

"I don't know anyone who could cause as much of a large mess as you. It makes sense, though. You never took no for an answer, not even on Blade island. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here today."

Just by the way he had spoken, even though the sound of the voice wasn't the same. Quinn had grasped who it was instantly. A lump was felt in his throat.

It felt like he wanted to cry, he wanted to show emotions and knew what this feeling was, having felt it before, but it was almost as if his body wasn't letting him, so instead, he smiled and went in for another hug.

"Hey, hey!" Vorden said. "You do know who this is, right? I'm not Layla."

"Of course, I know who you are," Quinn said, pulling away.

"Vorden, I'm glad you are here. I'm happy that there are still people that I know. Honestly... when I received this chest piece, I thought you might have been dead..."

During Quinn's little talk, the sound of Muka clearing her throat was heard. There was a lot that she wanted to say as well. Quinn realised it wasn't the time to speak, and the ship was already airborne ready to leave.

Before it did, the ship was shaking a few times due to the energy in the distance. Looking out of the glass, one could see small specks of explosions that were actually quite large and only looked small due to the distance.

"I know a lot of you want to speak to me. I want to speak to you all as well, but there is something I need to do before we leave this place."

"Can you head towards where those explosions are going? Don't get too close, and don't worry, I can protect us!" Quinn said.

Some thought he was crazy, even Jessica, who didn't quite know what was happening; for one, everyone who was meant to be here was already here, but Vorden didn't hesitate as he went to the controls and started pushing forward.

"Don't worry. I won't get you guys involved in this. Just take me close enough to see what's happening, and then we can decide what to do." Quinn said as he walked over to the side of the ship where the door could be opened.

Quinn had decided to come back to the ship because he believed that Ray was alright. There was proof in that by the fact the fighting was still going on. On top of that, he had promised to get Jessica and was unsure if there would be more troubles on the way.

In the fight with Russ, something still felt off, and there was the celestial he was worried about. The fact that a celestial or someone with celestial energy was with the Chained in the first place was worrying and strange.

"What are you planning to do," Vorden said, getting close to Quinn.

"The energy readings are strong... really strong, Quinn. I don't quite know what is going on out there myself. Maybe you know a little more, but Chris and that Dragon of yours that you summoned are the ones fighting."

"Chris! You mean Chris from Pure!" Quinn said, surprised.

Out of all the people to produce this much energy and last this long against someone as great as Ray, Quinn never expected it to be Chris, even with the increase of Qi energy he could feel.

Pressing a button by the side, the side wing of the spaceship started to open up, and at the same time, Quinn activated his demon tier chest piece.

"I have to stop this fighting before they destroy the planet that everyone has been trying so hard to save. Get out of here!"

Quinn shouted as he jumped out of the spaceship and started to fly off in the distance towards the fight.
