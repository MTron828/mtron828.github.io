Currently, Muka had been one of the vampires that was leading the investigation looking into those in the settlement that could have a marking. The problem was there was so much to go through. 

There were the conflicts that would happen within the settlement, there was the family belonging to Magnus, all of those that had been in contact with Magnus, and to try to look out for everyone that was close to Quinn. 

It was something that needed a large force to act and go through, but who could they trust? Even hand picking people Muka had to make sure that none of them were marked and it was a hard process. 

She had first gone to some of the new vampire knights in the 9th family. Edvard, although an original, had stepped down as leader of the family leaving it all to Muka. He had always thought she was a better fit anyway, and he wanted to help Quinn more by being right by his side. 

The knights should have had little contact with Magnus, but just in case an intense questioning period had begun. Muka was using her influence powers to ask them a series of questions. 

Then based on those questions she would decide whether they could be trusted or not, and they had passed, but a team of three was still an incredibly small team. 

A 3D projection was being displayed to Muka in her castle. It was several lists, and she had no clue where to start. 

'Quinn trusts me to do this, based on my inquisitive mind, and how I helped him out before… but stopping something before it even happened, is a really hard thing to do.' 

Muka started to just wander with her finger, she was dragging it down and thought to just stop somewhere, maybe her ability would kick in and give her some sort of luck.

"My lady!" one of the vampire knights had burst into the room, her name was Leona, another female vampire, who had her hair strangely dyed blue, and split into two ponytails. "We have found one with a marking, the marking that you are talking about."

"That was fast." Muka was surprised. 

According to the information she had received, they were able to hide their markings, so unless a person was showing it off or using it, then It shouldn't be seen.

'Maybe, my good luck is working out, after all.' She thought to herself.

"Where were they discovered, what were they doing, and who are they?" Muka asked. 

Leona bowed, before giving her report.

"Yes ma'am. We found out that Magnus was frequently visiting the cells. We were able to get this information fast since the 9th family is also in charge of the locking systems to the underground cells. 

"We then checked all of the locked up prisoners, and have found a few with the markings you speak of."

"A few!" 

At first, Muka thought the news of a marking was a good thing, but now hearing that there was more than one, it was worrying her for some reason. She had this tingling feeling in the back of her head.

Regardless, she had decided to contact Quinn and inform him of what they had found, it was what he had ordered after all. 

"That's great work Muka, I'll be there straight away and meet you there." Quinn replied.

This tingling feeling wouldn't go away from Muka though, and she went back to look at the holograph of lists she had up. She went ahead and looked at where her finger had landed, and could see it was on a particular name.

"Quinn will be able to deal with whatever is happening in the cells himself." Muka said as she wafted the screen away. "I need to check this out instead."

——

The underground network for vampires had been recreated, including that of the special tombs for the families, and just like before the ninth family were in charge of putting combination locks in the tunnels. 

Of course, not every society was perfect, no matter how good one's life was. There were just people who did bad things. 

Which was why, the main prison for vampires had also been created underground at the back of the settlement. It wasn't located directly in the settlement; it was located behind it, away from others. 

With Quinn's shadow travel he was able to get through everything with relative ease, and he was now walking through the cells. They were different from other cells. The criminals were all trapped behind special glass, similar to the one Jared was trapped behind that was made by Vincent.

In front of the glass, there was also a wall of pure energy powered by beast crystals, Quinn could feel it.

Having entered through unconventional means, several vampires were rushing towards him with their weapons drawn, but as soon as they saw who it was they put their weapons down and bowed down. 

"Sir Quinn!" The front of the small defence squad said. "I didn't realise that you would be inside already. Vampire Knight Leona has advised that no one was to go close to the subjects, including us. Everyone has been keeping an eye on one another to not go close… it's the last two cells on the right.

"Stay here." Quinn ordered and quickly ran to the cells and could see them standing there. They certainly did have the mark, it was clear on both of them, lighting up on their heads. 

'They are not in the same state as Jared… it looks like they are in control but the marking is just lighting up on their head.' 

Looking inside the cells closer, Quinn could see that there was blood inside, but the vampires were the only ones in their own cells, so it meant that the blood could have only come from themselves. 

"Immortui, what game are you playing, can you hear me?" Quinn asked. 

The two in the cell looked confused, as they just stared back at Quinn. Something didn't feel right, the markings on their heads now of all times, and the blood in their cells. Why here, why chose prisoners that were locked up to mark, what exactly could they do?

To find out, he would need to do more questioning.

——

Muka had finally arrived at where she wanted to be, it was a different location from Quinn. Rather than to the prison, she instead stood in front of what seemingly seemed like a normal house. 

She went up to the door and gave it a knock a couple of times. She then tried to knock louder when there was no answer. 

"Hello!" Muka stated. "Is anybody inside?"

There was still no answer, but it was the middle of the day, so it was quite common for everyone to be out, but due to the annoying feeling she could feel, Muka decided to push the door handle down.

To her surprise it was unlocked. She let herself into the house, and so far all was normal, but turning her head right she could see that the kitchen was a complete mess. The table had been destroyed, broken into pieces, and it was the same for some of the chairs.

That's when she could see it as well, there was blood on the ground. 

"Wait, I can hear something." 

Listening, Muka was hearing very faint groans, quickly she rushed to where the sound was coming from, in the living room, she could see a beaten and bloody woman. Her arms were cut quite badly but she would survive this, 

"It's going to be okay, I promise, here drink this." Muka said, giving the woman a flask. 

She gulped the blood down, and as blood did, it started to work its magic. 

"Who did this to you?" Muka asked. 

"I… I don't know. I've never seen them before… I just know they were male." The woman answered, still relatively weak. 

"Please… they took my husband, I don't know why, he tried fighting back, but they were too strong and they took my husband." The woman continued. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The annoying feeling, Muka's heart was starting to race, because for once she didn't want her good luck to be right.

"Your husband's name, is it Ronkin?" Muka asked.
