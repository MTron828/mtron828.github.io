In a way fighting one of the demon kings would be like killing three birds with one stone in Quinn's mind. One it would allow him to gather information about where Immortui was, two it would allow him to obtain a new blood aura upgrade and see if there was a further evolution. 

Lastly, just as Anon stated, it would allow him to know the level of the demon kings, and give him an idea of how close he was to Immortui's strength. Having taken out what was believed to be one of the last of Immortui's powerful dedicated followers, it would even take him some time to come up with something that the other's couldn't handle. 

'There are a lot of strong people still, Sil, Chris, Peter, Layla. All of them have the capabilities to protect themselves from the dedicated followers. Even Andy was a big help against Magnus.' Quinn thought. 

Which was why he had somewhat agreed to Anon's little plan. They had found a large tree to camp in. The base of the tree was large and hollowed out. It reminded Quinn a lot of the area where he had met the demon tier owl in that time. 

However, the tree base was smaller than that of the time before. 

"I know you seem to be in a rush to do things, but before you rush off, I just wanted to explain the situation to you. I won't ask you why you are after Immortui, it's good enough that both of our goals are the same." Anon explained. 

Using the active skill on his boots, Quinn created two clones of himself. All three were surprised by this but not completely shocked. There were many things that natives could do from different planets. 

They were more so amazed at how accurate these clones seemed to be, and just what Quinn was planning to do with them. 

"Don't worry, we can talk, I won't be wasting my time." Quinn said, as the two clones were sent out of the large tree. 

They were set to go through the forest, scouting how large the area was, and to see just how much trouble they would be. Since the clones were only fifty percent of his strength, he felt like they could handle whatever they ran into, and would be fast enough to avoid attacks here and there. 

"Alright, I still don't want to take up too much of your time." Anon said. "The people I asked you to help rescue earlier, they are referred to as the champions. I'm sure you don't know, but here, even before Immortui arrived. Our kind would fight over the smallest of things, maybe if one just looked at another the wrong way, we would go out of our way to prove our strength. There aren't many that work together, and the weaker of our kind, had to somewhat band together to build up small communities."

"But because of our nature, even that wasn't easy and there would be constant fights among each other. However, there were three individuals who came out on top of it all. Three that people wouldn't dare try and go against.

"These were called the champions. They were so powerful that most people would avoid them all together, and at the same time they would be constantly challenged for their position. 

"You see, when Immortui came, he had come alone. The demon kings were not yet a thing, his creations weren't strong at the start, and he had faced these champions alone. 

"Tales of the fight between Immortui and the champions had spread far and wide, as some were able to see them from a distance, but those too close were unable to survive.

"However, Immortui never fought the champions together, and the champions themselves never fought against Immortui while he was in a fight with one of the others. It was against their code. 

"Perhaps it was their pride, or belief, that since another champion lost, if they were to win against Immortui, then they had the claim to be the strongest. In the end though, all three of the champions fell to Immortui one by one."

Listening to the story, it seemed that the champions were quite strong, at least strong enough to directly fight Immortui by themself. Quinn could imagine, if those with the skull heads were just regular people in this world, then there would be some strong figures, especially with how the world was. 

"Wait, If Immortui defeated them, then are they not dead? What do you mean by rescuing them?" Quinn asked. 

Anon shook his head. 

"None of the three champions are dead. Immortui, he seems to keep the strong alive. Breaking them down, or using something against them to hope they join his army. At the moment, two of the champions are currently on Immortui's side. 

"But that's only because they know they are unable to fight back. If they were to fight together maybe they would have a chance against Immortui, but with the demon kings around. They would struggle. 

"As for the third champion, he has been captured instead, and locked away, being guarded by one of the demon kings. He refuses to work for Immortui, but at the same time Immortui wishes to use his power and is attempting to break him down day by day.

"He… is one of us, a Skully, and these hunting games, seeing his own people attacked like this, is one of the ways that he is trying to break down the champion. If he decides to work for Immortui, the hunting games will stop."

Quinn understood now why Anon seemed to be so involved and wished to save this person, and why he thought he would be a big help to the fight with Immortui. 

"There is something about your story though, the champions, you stated, have high pride. Even if I was to rescue the one on this planet, do you really think he would team up with me to take on Immortui? You see, for me I don't care what it takes, what I have to do, I will get rid of him, but is it the same for them?"

Anon didn't answer straight away, and it was Tuni who stepped forward with honesty. 

"It is unlikely." Tuni answered. "Anon has missed out a big part of what he said. These hunting games have been going on for years now and there has been no result, do you know why? It is because the champions never cared for us in the first place. Only themselves. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Before Immortui was here, the champions were the ones that would cause real havoc. The champions care for nothing but fighting."

"If that is true, then why didn't he join the others!" Anon shouted back. "The ones that betrayed us."

"Why?" Ekeke interrupted. "Because he is stubborn. The others just care about continuing to fight, while Morbo cares for no one but himself, he would never work with anyone."

In a sense, from what Quinn was hearing, releasing this champion named Morbo would be a double edged sword, he may very well be one that will fight against him.

"Thank you for explaining everything. You have explained a lot to me, for now, I will continue on my own. The champions, they can decide what they wish to do after I take out Immortui. 

"When I take him out, or the demon king out, they will be free, and then we will see what happens." Quinn answered. 

——

The clones that were being sent out, were doing more than the others had realised, they had already ran into several demons and during their meeting they had taken out demon after demon that were involved in the hunting games. 

Skully's that were on the verge of death were being saved left and right by a figure that would just come and go. They didn't even know what was happening or what something so powerful was going up against the demons, but as Skully's met up with each other sharing the same story, the figure was being spread. 

"Is this the start of a new champion… one that has come to save us!" They thought.

At the same time, the reports were finally coming in, to the demons that were in charge of the hunting game, reports that multiple demons were dying, and they were starting to act.
