[Greater Demon blood has been absorbed]

[A new demon race has been discovered]

[Demon Race: Yak]

[The blood absorbed is not at a high enough level to evolve blood aura]

Quinn stood there looking at the system message. He had put all his strength into his punch, just in case the one rushing toward him was one of the Demon Kings but now he knew that wasn't the case at all. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Durum type demons he had been taking out in the forest were lesser demons, a rank above a regular demon. In this case, the large Yak type, although it was a new type of demon it was at the Greater Demon level.

The same level as the giant hand Quinn had seen. There were still the Demon generals and the Demon kings above those as well. 

'Still, not all has been lost, it appears that I am coming across the different types of demon races sooner than I thought. The Durum and the Yak are two new types and if I meet those demon generals and absorb them I will be over half way to completing my quest.'

After jumping from his position, Quinn leapt a great distance in the forest and kicked his foot in the air using the special boots. It looked like he could do a limitless jump or one was walking on air because he essentially was and had landed right where the dead body was. 

This was where the three Skullys were currently at as well. They had rushed toward the Yak demon as soon as they saw its body fall. They were still in disbelief thinking that it would move, but when it was clearly missing its head, with blood pouring out of the top, they knew that it certainly was dead.

Moving his head in closer, Anon was trying to look at certain traits of the demon in front of him. 

"This is a Yak right? I'm sure of it." Anon said. 

"It's hard to tell completely without the head." Ekeke replied. "Usually the tusks on the head would be a sure way to tell, but to be honest, what else could it be?" 

All three of the Skullys thought back to the Yaks that they had faced. When fights broke out all over the world, everyone had dealt with all sorts of different types of demons. 

Although they hadn't seen a Yak demon in the area for a long time, they could still remember their devastating power. On top of that, their hard skin and durability. They would continue to move forward to charge and fight no matter how injured they were. 

They almost seemed like unkillable gods in their eyes, yet, here one had been defeated in front of them, and it was with a hit that the others couldn't even see. 

Anon himself was giving a side eye at Quinn, trying to see if there was anything out of the ordinary.

'I knew he was strong, and I had a thought that he might have the strength to back up his words when he said he wanted to take out Immortui, but deep down it was hard to believe. Now though, it's clear. 

'He at least has the same strength as some of the champions… but isn't it really strange why have we never heard of someone like this? And wouldn't the demons have taken him out.' 

Anon desperately wanted to ask, or know why he had fallen out of the sky like so into the hunting grounds, but there was a chance knowing the truth could put a damper on the relationship between the two.

———

At the camp that had been set up outside the base, Lexor, the demon general that was in charge of the whole situation was continuing to have a look at the system that was set up. Every one of the demons had a tracker that was linked to the computer system they were using.

That's when he could see it… that Kilbog had been killed. 

'He was only sent in around 15 minutes ago.' Lexor thought. 'And he has already been killed, just what level of enemy are we dealing with here… is it even something that I can take on?'

One might think that Immortui would have warned the other demons of what was going on after having received the report that Quinn had entered, but this was not Immortui's way. 

In the first place, although the demon kings did as he asked, those that weren't close to him, those other than the two that were by his side, were free to do what they wanted in the world. 

If the demon kings were to die, then it was simple, it meant that they weren't strong enough. Whoever killed them, Immortui would just try to best them, and if he did, then they would become the replacement for the demon king, essentially creating a new demon king. 

This is what Immortui always did, use those that used to be his enemy and if they were strong enough, somehow allow them to join his power. Even though the demons were a branch of Immortui's power, they were all individuals, they all had the choice not to listen to him, it had just turned out the way it was over time. 

"Has everyone gathered!" Lexor shouted. 

In front of him, those at the base, which numbered around fifty demons, as well as those that were part of the hunting ground, which were around a hundred in number had returned, although a hundred had been sent out, a hundred hadn't returned, it was closer to 70. 

Checking all of the numbers, the nervousness on Lexor's face was still showing.

'There are less than I thought, how could so many have died before we realised anything… were they really killed so fast? Is this one being's doing or a surge in power of the Skullys' 

"I am sure you are annoyed that the hunt has been called off, but this is an emergency measure, so much so, that a report has even been sent to our Demon king." Lexor announced.

At first, all of the demons were annoyed and complaining and muttering under their breath, wondering why the hunt had to be called off. The news had yet to reach everyone, but now they had heard that the Demon king had been informed, they knew that it was far more serious than they imagined. 

"I heard that quite a few of those taking part in the hunt died this time." 

"Really? But doesn't some of the weak bunch die anyway?"

"Yeah, some, can't you tell by looking around, quite a few of us have been taken out." 

"So have the Skullys teamed up? They've tried that before, but I thought that was all part of the game. Then we just team up and take them out." 

"It wasn't a Skully… it's something else." Another one mentioned. "Before I came here I saw them. They had flesh all over their body and were wearing armour that was glowing with power. It happened so fast… the other two that were with me had been taken out." 

"Wait a moment!" Lexor said, as he overheard the conversation that had occurred. "You saw who did this? Why haven't you reported this?"

"It's because I just arrived here now, when you told us the hunt was over, it was on the way over here." 

Lexor had already heard about the attacker from one survivor, but they had seen nothing, so then how did this Durum see something and still survive?

"Why… are you alive, if you looked at him… why are you alive?" Lexor asked. 

"I don't know, I just ran, and when I turned around I could see him looking at me." 

Panic started to set in Lexor's heart.

"You idiot, they let you live because they were following you, and you have led them right to us!"

Right then, crashing in the middle of the two, was a small human figure, wearing full armour, and full of flesh.

Back deep in the forest, Quinn smiled. 

"It looks like I found what I was looking for."
