Only a few days had passed since the Mermerial meeting and it was time for the Grand Meet Up! It was an event that had been planned before the Mermerials had done their visit, so the show had to go on, and the problems seemed minimal. 

After Xoxy and Yongbu left, the Mermerial elders left with no trouble at all. No one had returned and from what Layla had heard from Muka, they had received an update that Yongbu had gone through with his promise. He had gotten rid of the troublesome Predators or at least got them under control.

There were no surprise visitors during that time, and Minny and Galen both were in safe hands with no trouble happening to them at all. In fact, Layla wanted to actually thank Galen for capturing Xoxy, but it was hard for her to do so, since she didn't want to praise her son for doing something that she hadn't asked. 

He was, after all, only a little child. It was an important time for them, what happened now could greatly influence their character in the future, so he needed some ground rules, just Layla wasn't able to catch him most of the time to punish him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Today was a special day for Layla though, as she would try her best to forget about the troubles, because she would be going to the Grand Meet Up, not as a political figure but as a parent, who was going to watch her child.

Muka, as the settlement leader in replace of Quinn, would be dealing with all of that, along with Xander.

She was currently walking outside of the settlement through a wide open pathway that had been created, holding onto Galen's hand. The pathway was extremely wide, and had trees set up every five metres from each other on the side. Beyond those trees the natural forest that was next to the settlement could be seen with fields of flowers. 

It was a beautiful sight that the guests enjoyed appreciating. They would often stop once in a while just to take in the sights around them. It was filled with vampires from the settlement, and those from the Vampire Corps and Graylash planets. 

'It looks like getting the help of Logan was a good idea.' Layla thought. 'He really went all out in making this place stand out. It's breathtaking even for the vampires in the settlement.' 

It wasn't just the pathway though, because the pathway itself was just the start. It was leading all of the vampires to the main attraction which was the large stadium that had been built. It was large in size, and could hold a little over a 100,000 people. It had that many seats. 

It was designed to allow every vampire, if they wanted, to view this grand event. Of course not every vampire had turned up, but from the looks of things it was pretty close to it. 

Events like these, if continued, would allow the vampires to thrive and their population to hopefully grow into larger numbers. After losing their forces to war after war, it truly was something they needed. 

Entering the stadium, vampires were there working as guards and were there to welcome them all. Due to Layla's position, she was treated as a VIP member and there was no need for her to queue. 

She went right through after receiving a couple of juice boxes for Galen and went straight into the seating area. Her seats were close to the ground floor, and were with the other family leaders and viscounts.

The stadium area that they were to watch was incredibly large and had a number of different devices set up for the games that they would be seeing. An obstacle like course created for vampires. A target hitting area where vampires were to see how good their blood control was, and there was an arena for one on one battles that would be taking place as well. 

Out on the field, lined up getting ready for the opening ceremony, were the three vampire groups and their children. Muka, Xander and the principal of Roland Academy stood in front of their group of kids. 

Layla could see Minny and she and little Galen were waving over, but she had no reaction so it was hard to know if she spotted them or not. 

"Hey, I think your mum's waving at you." Tobi said. "Why don't you wave back." He nudged her on the arm. 

"It's so embarrassing." Minny said. "Why is she waving? I see her everyday, and will be seeing her after this event anyway."

"We need to focus anyway." Abby said. "We all need to show that the vampire settlement is the best. Remember the teacher said we would get a lot of honour points that could be traded in for grand prizes!"

Abby's eyes were burning with fire.

"Yeah, it's a shame really that Minny wasn't able to take part in all of the events otherwise we would have won this thing for sure." Tobi said. "Still, I guess at least she can take part in two events and we know they're in the bag. What was it again? The agility course and the arena battles."

Just as Tobi said, the teachers wanted to put Minny in for every event, but to make things fair, they limited the event to two activities per student. After all, this was to showcase the whole school, not just a single talented student. 

"Hey, we can't get to cocky." Abby said. "We don't know the strength of the other schools, who knows maybe they will even have geniuses as well."

To the left side of the vampire settlement group, there was the Vampire Corps group. They had Andy standing in front of the kids, as well as Jessica by his side. After the events they had been through, Jessica was confident to stay by Andy's side. 

He was strong after all, and she felt like he could protect her well. She was also loyal to the Vampire Corps and had done a lot for them, so she had been promoted to a chief position and invited as one of the leaders of the events for their group. 

Lastly, there were those from the Graylash group. In total, there were three leaders and not just a single leader. They had a community that helped the vampires of those on the Graylash planet but since they didn't operate the same way as the other groups, they needed three people to represent them. 

One, a tall vampire woman that was taller than most men called Valnar, then by her side there were two male vampires, one named Fenkelm and lastly a vampire who was named Sin. 

The three of them looked at the students and were happy and amazed at the vampire settlement. Seeing how things were, they thought maybe the vampire settlement was a better place to raise the children then the Graylash planets which was part of their aim. 

However, Sin was the one with the biggest smile on his face. 

'I made it here, I made it back and it looks like no one has noticed a thing. I will find out where Quinn is, and what's happened to him before I leave this place, no matter what!' Xox thought. 

This was the start of the event that would cause a huge ripple effect.
