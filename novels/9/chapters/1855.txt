Chapter 1856: A kindle flame.

During the time that Leo had spent in the vampire settlement, he had only gotten along and close to a few people. But he didn't know how most of them were. Sometimes he would wonder how those from the Tenth Family were after the war and what was left of them, at least. Years ago, Leo and Erin had trained them well to make them the Qi powerhouses in the vampire race.

As for the people from other families, he didn't particularly mingle with them much. At the time, when he was a Vampire Knight, the other vampires looked down on him because he was an outsider. However, there was an exception to all of that, and that was Silver.

He really didn't know why but the two of them got on well with each other after their first misunderstanding. Perhaps it was because they were both straightforward with each other. At the same time, although in the past, it didn't look so much since Leo looked more like an old man, the two were actually closer in age than one might think.

There was still a large age gap, just not from the side most people would think at first glance of the two.

"You actually contacted someone?" Chris was surprised. "I don't actually recognise this one. I thought you had lost all contact with those from the Cursed faction, so how did the two of you meet?"

"This someone has a name, and he just told you it's Silver." She glared at Chris.

Her first impressions of him weren't the best. Then again, she didn't really know who he was either.

The run-ins with Pure and vampires were practically non-existent most of the time since Pure's agenda was on the current government and ability users. Another thing to note was that the world had only found out about vampires recently, so it was hard to tell how different groups of people would treat them.

"It was a coincidence, honestly. You know, I have not only been helping people from attacks by vampires but also vampires that have been attacked by humans."

"I don't believe in one side more than the other. Rather, I look at the individual case where see one side has treated the other wrongly."

"One of them belonged to the Thirteenth family, of which Silver is in charge. I had... asked them if Silver was okay, and to pass on a message."

"Since then, we have communicated quite frequently through members of the Thirteenth family and eventually also got onto the subject of Erin."

After saying this name, Silver's whole demeanour turned uneasy. She looked around her as if saying the name itself would bring bad luck, and after talking for a while, the three of them decided to move and get to a more open area. When heading to a large meadow-like field, Chris noticed the hill where he and Zero had talked not too long ago.

"Uhm, maybe we should go to that hill? It looks better. I will race you there!" Chris said as he ran to a slightly smaller different hill that didn't have as nice of a view.

"Since when did you agree to take on a child?" Silver frowned.

"He's not a child, and even if he is acting strange today, he is actually a good-hearted guy. Although one day, I would like to have a child of my own." Leo said as he walked towards the hill where Chris had run up to.

"Oh really, well then I have to ask, is there anyone you have in mind? You do know that dating a human would be impossible for you, and besides, even if you could make it work, you would outlive her."

"It would be more beneficial for you to date a vampire." Silver smirked as she walked ahead of Leo and brushed her hair against the sun. "Perhaps, a beauty like me."

Hearing this, Leo smiled.

"You forgot I am blind. Women to me look similar, just wireframes and balls of energy with only a few variations."

"Sure I can tell girls apart based on the difference in their wireframes, but it is hard for me to... beautify that. Instead, I will prefer someone I get along with."

"Of course, a vampire would be preferable since I wish to have a family. And yeah, maybe someone like you would be nice."

After saying these words, Silver stopped in her tracks. She turned around, and although Leo couldn't see it, her face had turned slightly red, blushing ever so slightly. She was glad at this point that Leo couldn't see.

"Then, how about me?" Silver asked.

The two of them had an inkling for a while, a connection that the two of them felt from when they first met. The only thing was, it was hard to say what that feeling was. This conversation had cleared up the feeling she had, making her take the plunge.

Being a vampire was strange. They had a lot of time on this planet which made them view it differently compared to humans. It wasn't rare for vampires to have multiple partners as well because of this.

However, Silver was always occupied with her responsibilities, and never once, when meeting a person, she had felt this way. This odd feeling in her stomach she was feeling at this moment was new. She had an urge to tiptoe around the other person and keep herself in check to make sure he never saw the other side of her.

The thing was, there were many times where Silver had shown both the good and ugly sides of herself to Leo, and still, she felt no different, and he acted indifferently. Before, she had felt like a person who would always have to do things on her own to protect herself and those in her family, but with Leo around... she was happy for him to do that.

She wanted Leo's seriousness in his tasks, the mission and more to be used and channelled into being with her. The image in her head was a beautiful one.

"I can't." Leo's words pulled her out of her thoughts. "At least I can't yet. I would love to, but there are things that I still need to do, and you know that. Once I have accomplished them, though, I will happily come and seek you out wherever you are, and we can enjoy our time together."

It wasn't the answer Silver was expecting after pouring her heart out like that, but it was one that she liked. Without turning back, she ran off, heading straight to Chris' side right up the hill.

"Are you a baboon?" Silver remarked as soon as she reached the top. "The hill over there is far larger and taller. It has a better view for us to talk about matters."

"Do you really think that matters? Don't you know that Leo is blind? We just needed to get away from the other people." Chris replied.

The two were suddenly having a little argument, but it was because, for one, Silver was acting a bit shy while Chris was being protective over his new friend, the one he saw as his brother. Both of them were jealous of the other.

"Alright," Leo said, reaching the top. "Tell us what you know about Erin."

The argument soon stopped, and Silver instantly switched to work mode.

"Before I tell you this, I want to let you know it's a soft lead, but I know that you are grasping at straws here, and this could work. It's more of a trap than anything rather than information." Silver explained.

"Fex and Samantha have been doing their best to take care of the vampire soldiers that settled on Earth."

"Since Samantha is in a high position in the Earthborn group, she has sway over them."

"Because of this, trial runs were being conducted, and small groups of vampires were being introduced into communities or different human shelters." VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

"Earlier, they didn't face any significant problems, and the number of vampires was also increasing, but recently, there have been reports of vampire murders."

"Their heads were cut off. And now, every time a new trial has been initiated, the same thing happens. I don't believe this is a human's doing. Instead, I believe that it's the work of our little friend."

To start a fight with the current government after everything they had been through wasn't a smart move, and Leo knew that unless one was simply just acting to the will of their body, something like this wouldn't transpire. And based on this hypothesis, it had to be Erin.

"Just to let you know, another 'Trial' is about to begin. And it's in a Shelter not too far from here. I believe that if we bide our time, she will definitely turn up." Silver suggested.
