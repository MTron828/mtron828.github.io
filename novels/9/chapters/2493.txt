Throughout the entire red space, portals were opening up left, right, and centre. Coming through them were the Divine Brigade. An army that was controlled by the Ancient Ones and it was part of the power of Celestalon.

It was clear it was his doing for multiple reasons. One of them, the Divine Brigade, was a creation of his power, but even more definitive than that, was the fact that only the Ancient Ones had the power to freely move between the Universe spaces. 

There were ways that one might be able to move from one to the other, gathering a large amount of energy, but to send a whole army to one side or the other, could only be the work of the Ancient Ones.

The size of the portals were gigantic, and groups of the gold and black warriors were seen coming through. Their numbers were in the hundreds, and then quickly had escalated to the thousands, to the tens of thousands. 

It was a full scale attack. The portals weren't just placed in one area, but over all of the space, hanging over each of the planets.

In one section of the red space, there was a planet that had structures that were quite similar to that of the Romans from earth. Large pillars held up the bigger structures with detailed carvings on the rooftops and concrete. 

Everything was quite grand and large in size, including the regular houses, as for the ones that lived here, they looked the most like a human. They had the body structure of a human, but had patches of fur that would be growing from their body. 

This was the planet that now belonged to the werewolves, the ones known as the Glutton type. Each night their forms would drastically change, and when the demon king Unzoku howled. Their forms would change to the point it would be hard for one to even call them werewolves. 

A group of werewolves would be selected for the Pit project that Unzoku was running. He would rotate the werewolves, but there were also a select few positions that the werewolves needed to fight for as well. 

It was an honour to be part of the pit, because the werewolves knew that whoever entered the pit, and managed to survive, had come out a lot stronger, and Unzoku had ingrained in their mind that power was everything. 

Power was their status, and was the only meaning that the werewolves had in their life. The only thing that they could compete with or brag to each other about because there was nothing else for them.

Although Unzoku himself wasn't considered Immortui's right hand man like the other two demon kings, it was because of all of this, without a doubt, the one with the most powerful and strongest demon army, was the army of the werewolves. 

They were going about their lives as they walked through the town and the tiled streets. Some came out of large bath houses, while others practiced as they got ready to go into the pit that night as they had done on any other night. 

That was until they could see the large portals looming over their heads. 

"What is that?" One of the werewolves asked. 

The Divine Brigade, entering in black and gold, had flown out and were descending. Immediately, they locked their eyes on what was down below. Those that were black in colour held their spears out pointing it directly at the ground beneath them, and beams of dark energy shot out. 

It exploded as they hit the pillars, the ground, and the large buildings. Some of the attacks had hit the werewolves, going right through their body. However, as they had been hit, they immediately started to transform. 

All of the city of werewolves were beginning to transform, and howling out loud through the night. The scene had changed in an instant as everyone was quick to act. 

The werewolves climbed and jumped on top of building structures, then with the strength in their legs they leapt up with no fear, grabbing directly onto the Divine Brigade clawing at them directly. 

The Divine Brigade members swooped down, and were fighting on the ground floor as well. The golden one's healing the members that needed it, while teleporting, moving out of the way of the werewolves.

The fight was intense on both sides, with both having great power. 

However, the tide of the battle was soon to be turned. Bursting out of the large colosseum building, a werewolf far bigger than the rest had appeared and landed directly in the centre. It was the demon king. 

Immediately, he swiped his hand, hitting a group of five of the Divine Brigade and eliminated them quickly. Then he turned to those that were in the sky, and started to swing his arms rapidly, several claw strikes were seen in the air. 

The Divine Brigade used their attacks to try and stop the attack, but Unzoku's power was just far greater. Even with him helping though, the fight was still intensely going on all over the place, and he could see it. 

More of the Divine Brigade were coming through the portals. 

"HAWHOOOO!" Unzoku howled, and the Glutton type werewolves reacted in response. 

Their eyes were glowing with power and their bodies started to change. 

"Everyone, this is an attack from the enemy!" Unzoku shouted. "The ones we have been planning to go against for a long time now! It appears the time is upon us. Deal with what's in front of you, and then, make your way to the planet of the giants!"

——

In the same space, it wasn't just the werewolves that were having trouble. The portals had been open all over. Other demon races were putting up a fight, but without help it was harder for them to fight back. 

The Divine Brigade was just too powerful. Still, having expected this they did their best and were ready for battle. 

The ones who were not, however, were the local inhabitants. In a village full of Skullys, they had seen the portal up in the air, their fingers pointed, wondering what was going on. 

When the beings had come out of the portal, immediately they locked eyes on the Skullys, and it was a slaughter. The spear's energy went through their bodies. Their heads and limbs were ripped apart, and there was nothing they could do. 

Some tried to fight back, but they were able to only do a little damage and what little damage they did, would be healed by the golden ones. Seeing this, they had lost all hope, this was the elimination of every life form that belonged in the red space. 

———

Peter, Hikel, and Russ, had decided that they would continue their fight. They would try their best to get rid of another one of the demon kings, if they didn't get rid of him now, then they would just have to fight him later, and in turn it felt like they were just leaving him for Quinn. 

Luce was prepared, having grown his arm back, and so were the other three, until all of them noticed the portals that had been opening up all over the place. 

"No… now of all times!" Luce mumbled to himself. "Why would they do such a thing? Did they know what we were planning to do, or is it because of these invaders?" 

Groups of the Divine Brigade started to come out, and they could be seen flying over the land of giants. Chris and Edvard could see them, Quinn, where he was, along with the champions could see them coming out as well, but they were all left confused, as to what was happening, apart from Luce. 

"Judging from the look on that demon king's face, I don't think they're his allies." Hikel commented.  Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

When the Divine Brigade located those that were below, they pointed their spears, and dark energy started to gather at the tip. Immediately it was fired out, and Luce lifted his hand, creating the white shield, blocking the attack. 

Meanwhile, the others all decided to dive out of the way, jumping and moving from the attack. 

"Are they on our side or not?" Hikel thought seeing that. 

The dark and golden coloured beings had landed on the ground and went to strike their spear through Luce, it was clear that they were trying to fight him, and shoving his own spear right through one of their heads, it was clear that he wasn't on their side as well. 

That was when three of the Divine Brigade pointed their spears at Hikel, Russ and Peter as well, charging up an attack. 

"These b*stard's aren't on our side either!" Peter shouted.
