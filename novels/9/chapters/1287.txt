Chapter 1288 - The Special Box

Linda was unable to do anything to help Wevil. She laid there looking at the end of the person she had once hated, but who she had ended up falling in love with. Last time, she had been unable to help her brother Blip, blaming herself for him having lost his life.

Nothing seemed to have changed. Despite all the power she was supposed to have at her disposal, there she was failing to save a loved one once again.

She wanted to stretch out her arm towards Wevil, yet the only degree of movement she had in her was a slight twitch of her fingers. With the many wounds he had suffered it seemed impossible for him to have survived and the masked men weren't stopping, like ravenous beasts who had found food for the first time in weeks. Even though he was standing it seemed like it was only because of the others who were holding him up with their attacks.

Just as they had removed their hands from his body, Wevil's body flopped to the ground, showing no indication of life inside it.

'No! No!' Linda screamed in her head again. She was hoping to summon some type of surge in energy, similar to how little Wevil had been able to lift her gigantic body‚Ä¶ If she had been able to stay on top of him then perhaps he would have been the one to have survived.

Yet here she was still unable to move, her MC cells had been spent, so she could do nothing. After dealing with Wevil, the masked men started to come towards her, and through the jungle more men were starting to appear.

'Quinn, where are you‚Ä¶ weren't you meant to protect us? I thought you could feel it‚Ä¶ Is that why you haven't come yet? Could it be Wevil isn't‚Ä¶he isn't‚Ä¶dead.' Despite considering that possibility, deep down she knew that shouldn't be the case. As resilient as vampires and their subclasses might be, even Peter was unlikely to survive this degree of damage.

"Where the hell are you, Quinn?! You should be here!!" Linda screamed at the top of lungs while squinting her eyes shut. She had used her last breath and no longer knew what was happening anymore, as she closed her eyes, part of her looking forward to reuniting with Wevil.

However, after a while she could hear the sound of fighting.

'What is going on?' She thought.

Her energy was still weak so it was hard for her to open them, and eventually the fighting that she could hear had stopped nearly just as quickly as it had started.

'I guess I must have passed out for a few seconds‚Ä¶whoever they were fighting stopped.'

"Here, eat this! It should help you regain some of your strength." A voice ordered her. She was too weak to recognise it. The owner of the voice seemed to have noticed that Linda was too weak. The next moment she felt something pressed against her lips, and before she processed what her own body was doing, she realised she had already started eating whatever it was in front of her.

Energy started to gather inside her body, and her wounds began to heal once again. Finally, she had enough strength to open her eyes, and that's when she could see it. Around twenty masked men had been slaughtered, their limbs removed from their body. One in particular looked like they had been cut.

When looking down, Linda noticed she had nothing but a human bone from an arm in her hand.

"Flesh, but how, weren't they all vampires?" Linda questioned.

"Not all." The person next to her replied. Turning her head she soon could see a large black furred beast. "Vorden!"

"Calm down, even though you have eaten enough to recover your energy, it will still take some time for your body to heal. It looks like you really did push yourself beyond what you were cable off. Honestly, I don't think you can fight anymore, even if you ate more." Vorden spoke to her, although he wasn't entirely sure if that was true since he wasn't a Vampire himself. He was mostly basing his knowledge on what he knew about Peter.

"There's not just vampires among their group, there are also humans. Although rare, they're dangerous since they can use abilities. Oh, and they're also Dalki on the island."

Linda looked shocked to hear this, and she realised now where the arm she had gotten must have come from.

"Wait, if you were able to get to me in time, does that mean!'' Linda sprung up, to look in the direction of where she last saw Wevil. However, Vorden quickly blocked her view, shaking his head.

In the few seconds she had managed to look over there, she couldn't see Wevil's body, but judging by the way Vorden was reacting, it was clear that he hadn't survived.

Almost immediately, Linda started to feel weak again, and she lent up placing her head into Vorden's chest.

"He didn't deserve to die! Why him? Why?! Vorden, tell me! Why are we the only ones fighting on this damn island! Why are we the ones losing people all the time! And where is‚Ä¶where is‚Ä¶"

"Quinn?" Vorden finished her sentence for her not wanting her to speak or use up any more energy. "Quinn was actually the one who sent us here. He could tell that you guys were struggling but he had to attend to something else, and Linda this war‚Ä¶hasn't been good for any of us." G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

"How many lives have already been lost, and how many more will be lost‚Ä¶ I'm afraid we'll need to strengthen our resolve. This might not be the only loss we suffer this war, however he won't be forgotten. Wevil fought with his life for us, for the Cursed faction, for the human race."

"We need to make sure that he gave his life for a reason. You in particular Linda. I haven't been back with the Cursed faction for long, but I could tell that Wevil was always looking out for you."

Linda fell down once again, falling to the ground, but unfortunately they didn't have the luxury of time to allow her to grieve. The enemy was still on the move through the jungle, and Vorden, knowing this, grabbed onto Linda, flying back.

"Wait!" Linda cried out. "What about Wevil's body, where is it?"

"Wevil's body is being returned to the castle at the moment. Remember how I said we? The one that killed all those masked wasn't me Linda, it was Raten. Borden will take his body back to the Castle. I would never allow someone who fought so hard like that to get trampled or used for other means."

"I think it's best if we return as well Linda, take a break and rest for now, leave them to us."

Hearing these words, Linda soon closed her eyes and her exhaustion made her enter a deep sleep. Despite how fast Vorden was moving, and her having eaten, it was as if her mind had shut down with everything she had been through.

While travelling back to the castle, seeing Wevil's body before it was taken away. Vorden felt his arms constantly tensing as his blood boiled with anger. He was starting to worry whether they could actually win this fight and if so‚Ä¶ just how high would the cost be that they would have to pay?

Even with him and Raten having evolved, he couldn't help but wonder if it was worth it.

'Maybe the best thing to do is give up the fight for now. Otherwise, more of us will lose our lives in this, but can we even do that, how do we even get out of here?'

‚Äî‚Äî

At this moment, there was another Cursed faction group that was doing well up to a certain point, but now they were struggling as well. In this group, there was Fex, and Dennis who too had used their powers far more than they thought and were beginning to tire out.

At the moment, there were three of them, standing back to back. As for the third person, or being with them. It was a white haired gorilla with four arms. One of the Marked beasts being controlled by Quinn, who had been a great help to them so far.

There were other beasts originally by their side but now they had all been killed apart from one.

The whole group were surrounded by a mixture of vampires and humans and the group had become incredibly large in number reaching over forty.

"Do you think this is where our grave will be?" Dennis asked. At first they had been faring well, having already defeated around the same number surrounding them now, but as soon as they got tired, it was almost as if they were relying on their other allies to come and help.

"Don't speak like that, Old man. I'm not dying here, I have far too many things I need to do!" Fex shouted as he took the box off from his back that he had been carrying around the whole time and slammed it on the ground. "It's time to put this to use!"
