Setting off from the vampire settlement and Earth, the two large Marpo Cruise ships made their way to the next destination. The teams had been briefed on who they were going against and what the current plan was.

In the Marpo Cruise office, Jim was staring at a large tank of water. He had it built with all types of aquatic life inside, and it went from the floor, all the way to the tall ceiling of his room.

"Everything has been prepared just like you asked." Vincent said, who was also standing inside the room. "Logan will also be travelling with Jack and has supplied him with countless androids, but I assure you that he is in full support of you, and will update us on any suspicious movements that Jack makes."

Carefully following with his eyes Jim looked at the water-like beast in the tank, he then pressed his hand against it and a small scratch was made, from the crystal that was embedded into his hand.

"Vicnent, you have always been honest with me. Even from before‚Ä¶" Jim stopped as he started to think back to old memories, memories of before he had been banished from the vampire settlement and essentially made an outcast.

"I want you to tell me the truth. At the moment, who do you think has more power out of the two of us." Jim asked.

Vincent, placed his hand on his chin as he thought about the answer, but as always did indeed tell the truth.

"Before, the answer would have been quite clear, I would have said Jack. However, you have gained a lot of strength. You have woken up past leaders, as well as the original vampires.

"Jack has the support of the people on his side, the humans, because they can relate to him a lot more. Even if you are the Hero, it is hard for those to get behind ones that are different compared to them.

"Yet the human strength has seemed to weaken greatly, and you have of course Chris on your side, one of the strongest humans there is out there."

Jim finally turned around and went over to his seat as he placed both feet up on his desk.

"I feel like there is a but coming?" Jim raised his eyebrow.

"You have made the vampires the strongest they have ever been, and although I have no doubt about your strength against the humans, he has the Dalki on his side. Yes, we have come up with a solution to increase the vampires' strength. The Dalki blood, even creating the X tier solution for yourself, even with all of this progress, improving the vampires to the point they have never been before, the Dalki are something that even I can't predict.

"From what we have seen, the Dalki are able to evolve at an incredibly fast rate, and it's almost as if they are even competing against each other in terms of evolution. Before, no one thought there could be anything beyond a fifth spike. When a fifth spike is spotted more and more four spikes are seen.

"This pattern seems to continue, now that we have higher spikes, the rest of the Dalki are evolving with those at the top, at a pace that out matches what we vampires can achieve."

From the look on Jim's face, it was clear he wasn't happy with the answer Vincent gave him, but taking a deep breath he smiled.

"I would expect no less from the creation that I created!" Jim started to laugh. "Which is why the current situation annoys me so much. Nearly all of Jack's current strength comes from the Dalki, something that I made, and are only alive and present because of me. So why do they follow him!"

Thinking that this was a legitimate question Vincent went on to answer.

"The Dalki have always favoured strength, they follow those who are strong but just like nearly all races, that only counts for those that are within their own race. There are two by Jack's side that hold the most loyalty over the Dalki.

"There is H and Pine. Since these two are loyal to Jack, most of them are loyal to him."

It was a tricky situation, it wasn't as if no Dalki followed Jim though. He also had a relatively small army that followed him as well. Those that were more thoughtful, and thanked him for prolonging their original life span.

The problem was, they weren't full blooded warriors, it was almost because they could think more rationally with their thought, and be thankful to a person, rather than blindly following the one that was strong, they were slightly weaker.

"And that is something I still don't understand." Jim mumbled. "Why in the heavens would those two choose to follow him? Anyone can tell that the two of them are beyond anything that Jack has, or Jack himself. Which means, there has to be something, someway he has a hold over the two of them.

"I don't buy the fact that just because he was the one that gave them powers, they will stand by his side. That doesn't make any sense."

Vicnent actually agreed with this matter, he didn't say it out loud though. This was one of the tasks that had been given to him by Jim, but there had been no progress in the matter.

"I understand what you are trying to say, at the moment the two of us are relatively even, but eventually the Dalki will grow too strong for us, giving Jack the edge. That is fine, time is on my side with that one as well, as if we leave things too long, they will perish.

"Jack is too scared to attack in the first place, because I still have him by my side. As long as Ray is with me, then I believe he can still beat them all. The only problem is he is a bit of a loose cannon. I also have to make sure Malik is near him in case anything happens.

"Either way, there is not a single person that can beat him."

While Jim was smirking to himself, Vincent decided to ask a question that had been on his mind.

"Jim‚Ä¶ what are you looking for? It seems your search through the universe you are looking for something?" Vincent asked.

He was worried that maybe this question was too personal and would perhaps blow his cover, but Jim was so confident in Malki's abilities he answered quite easily.

"I wish to change the past." Jim answered. "I want my body back, my powers back, everything that happened to me to be returned, and for me to bring everyone down there. There is a large amount of power in this Universe I know it‚Ä¶ and it has to be out there."

The sound went off in the room, meaning it was time for everyone to get to their battle stations, the attack was to begin.
