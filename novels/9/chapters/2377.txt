Before Quinn had entered the camp site with all of the Durum and others, his clone had reached the area first causing chaos. However, Quinn had released not just one clone but two clones. 

One of them was busy attacking the base, the clone seemed to be strong enough to deal with the demons so he felt that there was no need for two, and even if there was, the second clone was dealing with a much more important task. 

The clone had gone past the camp and in doing so it was exploring the rest of the planet they were on. From the information Quinn had received he knew of two things, for one that there is one that is called the champion somewhere on the planet as well as the demon king. 

Not travelling with others and having extra help, this clone was able to put its full attention into exploring the planet ignoring the demons until it saw something interesting.

'This place has a large lack of life on the planets.' The clone thought. 'It might just be the case for this planet in general. There are plenty of planets near Earth that also have a lack of life. 

'It makes me wonder, if all of this is due to the doing of Immortui, or if it's always been like this. The world feels completely different, even the air itself feels filled with energy compared to earth.' 

The clone was feeling a strange sensation, just being here, he could almost feel the energy lingering in the air entering him and powering him up. With this excess energy entering them, it almost wanted the clone to expand it out somehow, making it want to fight. 

Perhaps, it was Immortui's doing, or just this universe in general, something in it that caused the creatures to fight against each other. It made the clone wonder what would happen to the real Quinn if he stayed here too long. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After searching the lands for a while, it finally looked like the clone had found something different in this world. There was a large staircase leading up to a platform, looking almost like an altar. 

The stairs went incredibly far out, almost a kilometre side to side. They looked old, as there were many cracks in the staircase itself. At the bottom of the staircase though, there was no sign of any demons. 

'I don't know what this is, but there can't be any harm in searching this place. I mean if I disappear, it's not too much of a problem.' 

The clones were quite strange creations based on Quinn's thought. Quinn could pass information to each other. Also Quinn could direct them and order them on what to do, but they did have their own thoughts, allowing them to act freely as they wished.

Going up the steps, Quinn had quickly noticed how big the gap was between each of the steps. When standing on the first step alone his head only reached the next step. If he was just to try to go up them normally he never would have been able to. 

'These stairs are almost made for giants. The Durum demons are only a little bit bigger than regular humans, so I don't think it could have been made for them.' 

It was much more likely to have been made for something like the Yak demons and suited more their size. However, there was also a chance it was made by the natural inhabitants, after all not all of them were like the Skullys either. 

Although, so far on the planet, Quinn had only seen demons, Skullys, and the dead body of creatures that had low level beast-like intelligence.

Jumping up, Quinn managed to clear a few steps at a time, and the stairs went up higher than he thought. After jumping for a while he looked back and it was almost as if he was climbing a large mountain. 

There were even brown and orange coloured clouds that could be seen in certain areas, continuing up, he eventually came to the edge of the platform where it levelled out. 

It was made of the same stones as the staircase, but the platform looked to be even larger than the stairs themselves, as he was unable to see where it ended. 

'This whole thing, it almost looks like there was some type of city in the sky.' Quinn thought, turning his head glancing at the large pillars, the housing like structures. It was clear at some point, some sort of life did live here. 

A lot of the housing had even been destroyed, so much so that it looked like nothing but rubble. There was a clear street to walk on that the clone continued to follow it and eventually reaching the end, he could see something up ahead. 

On a pyramid like structure, there were five gigantic pillars, they were thick and went up so high into the sky that the clouds blocked the view of the very top. On these pillars though, there were chains that were solid green in colour.

The chains, they went across the floor, and were attached to a figure in the centre of the pillars that were spread out like a pentagon.

'That… it looks like a giant Skully?'

It was just as large as the Yak, but its features were completely different. It had the same half head skull-like design on its head. Rather than horns on top of the skull, this one had a singular horn. 

Then there were its knuckles and hands as well. Part of it was encased in an outer skeleton like design as well, but it was clear that it was the same type of inhabitant as Anon and the others, it was certainly a Skully despite its size.

The chains from the pillars were each wrapped around attached to certain cuffs on parts of its body. Around the wrists and ankles and one around the neck. The Skully in the centre was alive. 

'If I was to guess, I would have to say that this is one of the champions, the one that Anon talked about.' 

Jumping from his position, Quinn landed around twenty metres away from the Skully. Now that he was close, he noticed a few things. One, there was a large circle that had been drawn underneath the Skully, then underneath each of the pillars, each of them had circles drawn under them with symbols as well. 

'Magic circles… I guess it would make sense. If there is someone strong enough to fight against Immortui, then they wouldn't be able to restrict them via normal means.'

The Skully lifted its head, and looked straight at Quinn for a few moments. His eyes were not just staring at his features but almost trying to read him 

"It's been a long time since I have had a visitor." The Skully said. "Who would dare to climb the stairs, when they know what awaits them, are you another demon sent by him? To try and convince me to join you?" 

Based on the context, Quinn knew what this person was talking about. 

"You are one of the champions, correct? I have heard about you from your kind, how you fought against Immortui, and are trapped here because of him." 

The Skully shut up for a moment, because these weren't usually the words spoken by the demons that would come and see him. 

"Who are you?" The Skully asked. 

"Who am I? I don't think who I am would really matter to you, instead I will tell you the reason why I am here." Quinn said. "I am here to take down Immortui, and unlike you, I can not fail, no matter what the cost. 

"I was searching for him, and just happened to come across you." 

These words had put a large smile on the Skully's face. 

"You are right, I don't know who you are, but you seem crazy, a bit messed up in the head to say words like that. You really think you can beat Immortui, well, I guess we will soon find out."

Quinn wondered what he meant by those words, and soon saw the magic circle underneath the Skully light up. 

"Whenever someone comes to see me, the demon king, who is here to guard me, is informed. It's been a long time, a very long time, since I have seen the demon king. Let's see how long you will last."
