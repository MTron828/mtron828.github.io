Chapter 1225 Finding out secrets

The Dalki known as Graham had a firm grip on Quinn's current Dalki body, holding him at the top of his head. Quinn, having delivered one of his most powerful moves while also being in a strong body that relied on sturdiness and strength it looked like his attack had hardly affected him.

'With the last Dalki he was able to rip its limbs off with no trouble at all. He must have crazy grip strength. If I move my head, I'm done for!' Despite the thigh kick not working before. Quinn decided it was the only thing he could do.

Now, lifting his leg up again, Quinn went to kick the leg not once or twice but did so until his body would give up or tire out. As soon as his foot touched the ground, he lifted it up again, kicking his opponent's thigh. Loud thunderous bangs after bangs echoed throughout. The strength of the kicks was shaking even the volcano nearby.

"That move seems rather interesting. Maybe I should give it a go?" Graham said, still holding onto Quinn's head. He then lifted up and twisted his hips, trying to imitate the kick. It was a poor imitation of what Quinn had done, and it looked like nearly no effort had been put into it at all.

Yet, the second the foot touched him, he could feel his whole body falling to the ground. Before he knew it, Quinn could see the dark sky above. Quickly, he tried to get back up, knowing the longer he spent on the floor would mean doom to himself.

'Huh, why can't I get up?' Quinn wondered. It was only then that he realised that his left leg was bent in an unusual shape. His thigh almost looked like he had gained another joint. Underneath the hard Dalki skin, the area was heavily bruised and swollen.

'I‚Ä¶.I‚Ä¶have to do something. If this guy gets to the Shelter, there will be no one who can stop him!' Quinn thought.

Using this time, he realised that the Dalki was simply playing with him. All of his actions, not once had it seemed like it was being serious in the fight. Also, the Dalki wasn't aggressive like the others. Instead, it was slowly making its way towards Quinn.

In a way, this just sunk in the fact that Quinn was outmatched in this situation.

"I have to get up, I have to, but I can't draw any more energy from myself." Looking at his hands, Quinn thought of the only thing he could do. With his sharp claws, he started to claw at his enormous chest. Digging in his fingernails around an inch deep.

While in full control, Quinn could feel everything the Marked could, but he bore through it because he could tell it was working. The green blood flowing was making his body rise with new energy.

After scratching at his chest multiple times, he soon continued to do so on his forearms, drawing more and more blood, and that's when Quinn started to notice something as well. The green blood leaving his body wasn't only giving him energy, but the swelling on his leg had gone down. He wasn't sure if he was imagining it, but his legs were also starting to heal themselves.

'What is happening? I thought by hurting myself, I could muster up more energy, but losing blood is giving me the same effect as if I was to drink blood like a vampire?' Quinn started to think.

It was a strange feeling, to say the least. Although his energy and strength were seemingly at an all-time high, he could feel his heart weakening as if he was about to die. Bordering on the line between life and death.

And that was when the last change had occurred in Quinn's Dalki body. He could feel something growing from his back. Out from the middle of his back, a second spike popped out.

"An evolution at a time like this. Well, I can't say that I'm surprised, but if after all this time, you only were able to get to a two spike right now, it must have meant you haven't been doing a lot of fighting. Which is why I'm even more interested in you!" Graham said, charging forward. ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

Rolling like a log, Quinn moved away from a stomp coming from Graham. The hard ground broke apart, and red hot lava spewed from where he stepped. Soon Quinn pushed off the ground with his hands and looked ahead, trying to see where his enemy was.

'Now I'm a two spiked Dalki. My powers have increased even more!' Quinn thought. 'It has to be a sign that someone wants me to kill this damn Dalki!'

"Don't get too excited." A voice from behind Quinn's ear said, and the next second, Quinn's head was slammed into the ground. It wasn't just bashed into once. Graham continued to hit his head into the ground again and again repeatedly, and whatever Quinn tried, it wouldn't work. Before Quinn could even move, he was injured.

'This is the strength of a five spike?' Quinn was only left with these thoughts. 'Even with all this extra strength I have been given, I was still unable to do anything against it. I can't imagine anyone beating it. I haven't suffered a loss like this since‚Ä¶.Arthur.

'I wonder‚Ä¶I wonder how I would have done if I was in my own body.'

It was then that Quinn decided that he had no choice. He couldn't take the pain anymore. He had given up on trying to defeat the Dalki and found himself back inside his own body.

"Hey Quinn, are you okay?" A young voice said.

Looking up, Quinn could see the other members of the Cursed faction around him. He was in a pile of rubble, and the one who had spoken was Shiro.

'It looks like everyone is safe here, Vincent. Do you think you could quickly update me on what happened here?' Quinn asked, looking for an update on the details.

Giving him a quick skim of events, Quinn was happy to know that everyone was okay and that the Shelter was safe. His body was weak, and he wondered how long it would take him to recover, but that's when he realised something.

'Wait, the Demon tier amulet, I can still feel the Dalki's energy. Has the Dalkinot killed him? He did seem different compared to the others, and if it was a five spike, he had to have been one of their leaders. Maybe I can get some more information from them?

'Vincent, It looks like you did a good job, I'm sorry to say, but I'm going to have to leave you with them for a little while longer.'

Of course, Vincent had no problem with such a thing, and Quinn soon found himself returning to Dalki's body.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Arriving back in the Dalki, Quinn found himself in an immense amount of pain. He looked to be on one of the strange Dalki ships, heading towards the mother ship, and the one piloting it was none other than the one Quinn had fought not too long ago.

'He smashed all of my bones, but it looks like he also knew the right amount just to keep me alive. I'm sure he has a lot of questions for me, and it looks like they knew just the right amount to keep this body alive as well.' Quinn thought.

Keeping his mouth shut the whole way, Quinn's condition didn't seem to get better or worse. Finally, being carried by the Dalki with one hand, he found himself on the ship. Soon he had been taken to a room he had never seen before but was placed in something familiar.

Now, the Quinn's Dalki body was floating in a green liquid in a giant glass tube. His bones still didn't seem to be healing, but Quinn could feel his mind waking up again.

"This chamber will keep you alive, and if I want to, I can make it so this liquid speeds up the recovery of your body, healing it. Interesting right? The other Dalki don't know about it yet, but I've been developing the solution myself. A way to make the Dalki heal even quicker and eventually evolve on their own. Repeating the process will allow us to force an evolution on those that didn't quite manage to evolve on their own. You are a fortunate person to be in here, although I won't be healing your body until I find out just why you are so special." Graham said as he went off not too far away and started to work away at a strange-looking computer.

Quinn looked around the room to see if he could gather any information. Just being here now, he had already learnt that this strange contraption he was in was something they never knew about before. He wondered if it was because of such machines they had seen an increase in spikes on Dalki lately or if it hadn't been introduced yet.

Both of them were worrying thoughts. Staring off far, Quinn could see that Graham kept on glancing at something. That's when Quinn noticed what it was. It was a live stream. The stream coming from Bonny and void.

At the moment, what was being displayed was the fight between another five spike with a long tail, and Hilston.

'Hilston‚Ä¶.will he win?' Quinn wondered as he started to think who was stronger, having fought him and a five spike recently.
