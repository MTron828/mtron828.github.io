Chapter 2465 Preparing for the end (Part 2)

While running through the forest, towards the area that Chris was in earlier in the day, he stared at the bright moon that glimmered slightly red due to the mist.

'The moon is a lot brighter here than next to earth, or any of the other planets I have been on. The moon in the first place just reflects the light from the sun‚Ä¶ is it actually the power of the sun that's causing this effect, because I feel slightly energised.'

It wasn't the first time that Chris had felt this way, even before when he had entered the pit, when the night sky fell and the moon was seen, he felt great energy surrounding him but he was also noticing something else as well.

He was getting this urge, an urge to consume, and it had only grown since he had eaten the Yaks.

'I've been through a lot tougher things‚Ä¶ I'm confident, if it comes to it, I can control myself. I won't let this thing control my body.'

Slowing down his pace, Chris leapt up and with a single jump he had reached the branch of a large tree. He grabbed onto the branch and swung himself until he was in a crouching position overlooking the working area from before.

There was still the sound of banging, clashing and work going on, but it was quieter than before. Sniffing the air, Chris had made an evaluation.

'It smells like there's less people here than there were during the day‚Ä¶ but I need to try to find ones that are on their own, I doubt I will get lucky like before.'

At quick speed, when the opportunity struck, Chris leapt to the ground and ran on all fours, transforming his body, not to his werewolf form, but to his wolf form instead. He was now behind one of the giant ship structures that were being worked on.

In his wolf form, he was a lot faster than in his werewolf one. It mainly focused on speed, and he felt if he was seen, people would just think of him as another creature.

While right next to the large object, Chris lifted up his paws and tried to scratch the outside. When he let go, there wasn't a single mark on the outside.

'I even coated my claw's in Qi‚Ä¶ just what are these things made of?' Chris thought. 'If they're building something all day and night, it must be quite important.'

Hearing the sound of footsteps, it appeared as if someone was coming from the side. Hearing this, he quickly sprinted along the side of the ship and then hid around the other end taking a peek.

There he could see it, a Yak carrying over a rough edged rock on his shoulder. It got toward the middle of the ship, and bent its legs as if it was getting ready to jump.

'Now!' Chris ran in his full wolf form, and the Yak turned to look at him, the rock was still in his hands and the surprise attack was too fast for him, by the time the demon realised what was going on, Chris had already bit at his throat with his powerful jaws.

Blood soaked around and into his mouth as he gripped down further and the Yak body fell to the floor. Along with it, the large rock fell on top of him crushing part of his body.

The demon was killed but now Chris had a bit of a problem to deal with.

'Damn it.' Chris said, as he started to transform into his werewolf form, he then lifted the large rock off and placed it on the ground.

"Hey, what's going on!" A voice shouted from behind.

Around the corner there was another Yak, with a rock over his shoulder as well.

'Crap this was just meant to be an in and out operation, was I not thinking clearly or something, I should have waited to see if there was anyone else!'

It was too late now, as Chris continued to run across. The Yak preparing to fight back had dropped the large boulder.

Thinking fast, before the large boulder had fallen onto the floor, Chris threw a punch in the air. The third stage of Qi was unleashed from his fist and hit the rock, pushing it right into the Yak's body.

The sharp edges pierced into the Yak's body. It hurt as the Yak was kneeling over, and by that time Chris was already there with a forceful punch on the rock from his side, he pushed it right through the demon's body.

'Alright, that's two down‚Ä¶ I was going to feast on quite a few of them anyway. As Edvard said, If I'm going to do this, then I need to get as strong as possible.'

A thud was heard from Chris's right side this time. It was the pathway that led to the multiple ships that were being built on the side, and he could see it, a frightened demon who had dropped the large rock he was transporting.

'This just isn't my lucky day!' Chris thought as he was running after the Yak who was running as fast as he could.

The demon didn't scream, he didn't want to waste his breath as there was something right behind him, but of course Chris would catch up, and when he leapt up, he grabbed right onto his neck ripping right through it with his claws killing it on the spot.

"Alright, now it's time for clean up."

Not wasting time, Chris dragged the bodies away from the building site and placed them into the forest. He didn't feast on their bodies yet because he needed to get them out of the way before anyone else would find them.

When all three bodies had been cleared up, he started to eat away at them. Having done the same thing earlier in the day, it was less of a problem this time. As he feasted on them, quite a few thoughts were running through his head.

"Their blood, it's all over that place‚Ä¶ in the morning, when they notice that they're gone‚Ä¶ will it cause a large problem, or will they think something like a beast has done it?'

After consuming the demons, the energy boost was felt in Chris once again. His muscles felt more alive, his body more responsive than before. Which was a crazy feeling for him, who already thought he was in tune with his body.

It was an amazing feeling, because it almost felt like there was no limit. Just like his stomach, as long as he kept eating, he would continue to grow stronger, but there was one large issue he realised he had.

'Everytime I finished eating one demon, the strength I gained from the next was less than before. Does this mean that I have to eat even more to continue to grow?' Although Chris thought this, he remembered back to the pit.

The whole purpose of the pit was to create stronger beings, and in turn the werewolves would feast on them and grow in strength. Eventually eating demons would no longer allow him to grow, not unless they were stronger than they were before.

Jumping back up to the tree that was located between the edge of the building site, Chris realised that a commotion had already arisen. The blood that had split across the path had been discovered, and a few of the other demons had been called up. There was a group of six of them talking and discussing about the blood.

'Six‚Ä¶ can I take on six of them, without them alerting everyone?' Chris thought.

At this rate, he might end up taking out all of the workers. If it would delay the demon king and Immortui finding out about it though, he would.

The sound of loud footsteps and vibration entered his ears though. The Yak demons being large in size and literal giants made a lot of noise when they moved anyway, but this was different and this was heavier than the others.

Out from the side, appearing in front of the others, was a giant that was around one third larger compared to the others. It had a large belly in front of it, and a golden necklace around its neck that shined brightly.

'That is that one of the demon generals that they talked about. Didn't they say Quinn asked for their blood as well?' Chris thought, but another thought had entered his mind as drool was slipping from his mouth and onto the floor.

'I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ have to eat that. I wonder how much that will make me grow.'
