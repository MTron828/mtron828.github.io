Chapter 2541 ¬†The Last Vampire

A strange energy had faded from the vampires; their hearts were beating strangely. The air on their skin felt better, and things like their eyesight along with their sense of smell had all worsened.

For many, they were starting to panic; they had no clue what was happening, and for a lot of them, they had never even been human before. It was the first time they were experiencing such things, and it was scary, almost like a disease that was coming over them.

It wasn't just the vampires; the subclasses, the creations of the vampires, were all returning to normal. The undead wights, their hearts started to beat as they experienced life in a new form.

For some, rather than a power leaving them, it felt more like a power was changing them.

Peter was among this group of people. He stretched out his arms, clenched his hands several times, and ran his fingers down his skin. Then, lifting his hands, he touched water that was coming down from his face.

"My sense of feeling, my heartbeat... it's all come back!" Peter wanted to jump for joy.

How long had it been since he had felt like this? He was grateful for having become a wight and being able to help Quinn along the way. Eventually, it had even become a thing that he didn't realize he had missed.

Perhaps it was due to the dulling of his emotions, and now that he had obtained it all back, he felt great joy.

"Is this really happening... I can finally live my life... the way I was meant to," Peter said.

"So I guess I'm just going to be armless forever then," Hikel commented. His body had healed up, but he had no arms on his body.

"Hey, you can always get a bionic arm," Edvard commented, much more worried about his own condition. The moment he took the armour off, it would be the end of him. He could feel his vampire self having disappeared, but the power of the armour was strong, strong enough to keep him still the way he was.

For the older vampires who had lived thousands of years, including the originals, they had turned into a human whose body was at the age their appearance currently took on. For the originals, it was the same appearance they had from the day they had turned.

On that day, their life had taken a drastic turn, and with it, they felt like their old life was on pause until this very moment it had come back.

Even Chris, as he looked at his own body, he could feel his own blood didn't pump in the same way as it did around his body. The alterations that had been made, they were gone.

"I guess that means Quinn did it, he really did it, but doesn't it also mean... he's stuck there?"

One of the biggest changes that the vampires had immediately noticed, with the humans being around them left and right, was their taste for blood.

Layla was trying her best to get those who were less erratic to calm all the others down.

She was trying to make sense of it all, as even her power was now completely gone as well. From her right side, she had seen someone that made her heart skip. When she corrected her mind, her heart settled down for a moment.

"All of it is gone," Vincent said as he walked over. "It's the same for me, all of my powers to control blood. The thirst for blood, and even our pain in the sunlight. It's not just us, but all of the subclasses."

What Layla was happy to see more was the fact that Galen was also with Vincent. She was worried about where he had gone or what he was doing, but was a little less worried due to his powers with the shadow and ability to hide himself.

That was another thing that had changed though. When Layla had attempted to use her telekinesis powers, they had completely disappeared.

Just like when a human turned into a vampire all of their MC cells changed, the same thing had happened again. They could still learn abilities, but it just meant that they would have to start over.

As for the Shadow ability, Minny had lost that turning into a human as well. With everything going on, they didn't know whether to laugh and cry, and of all things, the humans with their abilities were rushing around helping out people the most.

"Wait a moment, all of the vampires have lost their powers?" Russ thought as he looked around. He still had his powers. "Does this mean that Quinn has lost his? With Sil in a bad state as well, and that wolf having lost his powers, does that make me the strongest in this world?"

Russ was already imagining what he might potentially be able to do, and was smirking to himself.

While Layla was checking out Galen, she soon saw him pointing a finger behind her, and he opened up his mouth to say a few words.

"Dad!" Galen shouted out.

Layla turned around, along with the rest of them that were in the area, and they saw a flicker of white energy disappear and in its place, there was one person left standing there, Quinn Talen.

"Damn it, they left immediately as well, before I could talk to them more," Quinn said, scratching his head. He started to sniff the air, and as he did, he looked at everyone that was staring back at him.

More importantly, more than anything, he was with his family. He could see the tears of Layla, his daughter Minny, and the smile on Galen's face.

"Did you think I died or something? I told you I would be back," Quinn said as he went in, knelt down, and hugged all three of his family members.

It was a bittersweet moment that no one wanted to end. As Quinn hugged them all, he realized something, though. He could smell it, he could sense it with the blood rushing through their veins; they were now different from him. Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

Russ stared at him, and for a second, Quinn opened his eyes glowing red, looking right at him.

Letting go, Quinn stood up.

"Don't worry about those that are underground," Quinn stated, talking about those that were still in the chambers underneath. "They are already dead."

Quinn could sense it from where he was. The vampires that hadn't gotten out of their chambers due to rubble. Those that had gone into an eternal slumber. There was now no way to bring them back. They were human, and their hearts were never to beat again.

The only thing was, the vampires had gone into eternal slumber thinking they would never have to wake up, and this would have to satisfy him now.

"This is going to be... a new start for us all," Quinn smiled.
