Chapter 1872 Vampire Vs Werewolf (Part 1)

The others continued to blink as they continued to see people they never thought they would see on the Pure base right here. Somehow, one way or another, Logan was in front of them. None of them had been given a portable teleport for Logan to use, so they could only guess one thing, it was an ability that the Blade had.

'How‚Ä¶ is that possible?' Lucia thought. 'Even if he did use an ability, a teleportation of some kind, Green City is thousands and thousands of miles away. How would anyone have the MC cells to make a trip there and come back.'

This was possible of course, because it was Sil, a person who had been increasing the amount of MC cells he could use for a long time, and that was exactly what he had done. When meeting Logan Green, even Logan himself was stunned.

However, explaining how the situation was pretty tense at the moment, Sil had only given a brief introduction, and had stated that Quinn was back as well. After that, Logan said that there was no need for him to say anymore, and would come with him telling him what he needed to do.

"I know this isn't what any of us expected. Honestly, I tried to predict a good amount of outcomes, and although I thought a fight would occur, I never thought that Quinn would come back in the middle of it, nor that Chris would choose to switch sides." Logan stated.

"Alright, no need to explain yourself," Sil replied. "All of you with Peter should be enough, but go ahead and take out the men at those facilities. Don't destroy everything, because we want Logan here to steal all the data they have. What is theirs will now become ours?

"In the meantime, me and Logan are going to try to find out what Agent 4 was doing in his lab. I will be here to protect Logan so don't worry about us, and if you need help, just shout really loud."

After seeing what Sil could do they had confidence in leaving them, and that's what they did, as they wished to complete the task before it got even more serious. Who knew, maybe a report was already sent out to Zero, and he was already on his way back.

Ceril had stayed with Sil, and the three of them headed to Agent 4's lab. It was time for Logan to do his stuff as he pressed both of his hands on the console, trying to get as much information as he could.

'I see, so there are a lot of protective barriers that you have created to try and stop my ability, but unfortunately for you. I am able to do things you could never imagine Agent 4.' Logan smiled to himself.

Information was flooding into his head, and after a couple of minutes only, he had let go.

"Those guys, they have the vampire armour, the one that Richard Eno was using."

"The one that was used on Blade island that Quinn talked about?" Sil replied. "Does that mean Pure were there that day? Were they working with Jim Eno as well?"

It seemed like a possibility, but there was no information about that day. Only the fact that they had been running tests on the blood armor and that they still had it.

"I‚Ä¶ also know what they plan to use the Red Heart for," Logan said.

From the get-go, after the fight that had occurred last time, Quinn knew that he couldn't go easy or pull any punches when fighting against Chris. He felt the strength from last time. This person was a bigger threat than Graham.

The strikes were more powerful, the healing capabilities were better, they were faster, and stronger at the same time. Which was why Quinn had used shadow overload on himself to drop down and bash both of his fists like a hammer straight on top of Chris's head.

His whole body had been slammed into the ground, but just as quickly as he had been hit, Chris came up swiping in the air. Leaning back the claws had missed Quinn's face by a few inches, but soon after a powerful strike had come out from them.

Quinn swiped both of his hands as fast as possible, using his hands in a claw-like shape, and ripped through the claw strikes, breaking them apart. Straight after seeing Chris in front of him, he kicked him right in the chest and a flow of red aura was blasted into Chris as it sent him across the floor.

The ground was kicked up so heavily behind him, that it looked like a mountain of dirt had been created. Not giving him any time to rest though, Chris noticed that there were two shadows right next to where he was.

'What is happening‚Ä¶ Was Quinn always this strong? Is he going to come through one of these?' Chris thought.

However, that wasn't the case at all, Quinn had used his soul weapon to change his gauntlets once again into the twin blade chains and he chucked them through two more shadows that were next to him, and immediately they went to where Chris was.

Using blood control, Quinn was even able to control the twin blade chains without having to swing them a certain way. Immediately they wrapped around and dug into Chris's arm. Twisting around them and contracting them in place.

'What are these things, I can't block them from entering my body with my Qi, the energy is different from what I've faced before. Ah‚Ä¶ screw it, it just means I'm going to have to win with raw power.'

Despite the chains digging deeper into Chris's werewolf body, and his blood dripping onto the floor, he ignored all of that as he howled into the air, and began to run forward.

Due to the chains still being linked to Quinn. Suddenly, Quinn felt his whole body being pulled forward towards his two shadows in front of him. He tried to pull back but it seemed impossible, so instead he changed the shape and form of his soul weapon back into the gauntlets again.

Seeing Chris have a speed boost, Quinn went to close his shadow wings to block the attack or redirect it back. The only thing was, Chris was fast, extremely fast. He had already gotten past Quinn's wings and now was directly in front of him. Throwing out both of his clawed hands in an X shape, it had ripped the demon tier armour that the vampire celestial was wearing in seconds.

The shadow on his wings disappeared, and the chest piece had fallen onto the floor. Right across Quinn's chest, blood squirted out in a large X shape, and he was sent flying back.

Quinn remained standing but the clawed X shape was still across his chest, bleeding and falling to the ground.

'I guess I was wrong to think I could beat you in a physical fight." Quinn stated. "But I'm still going to try anyway."

The blood that was around his chest started to harden, and a celestial blood armour had been made with a similar design to that on his shoulder. Around the pectoral chest bit there were twirls that looked like horns, and on the abdominal part of the chest piece, there were fangs that looked like the teeth of the vampire.

Finally though, one hand continued to glow red, and with it there looked to be a gauntlet like he had on before, but a large scythe in his hand. While the other was solidified shadows. The entire of Quinn's left arm was a dark purple that went right up to his elbow and started to trail off.

Chris didn't know why, but his instincts seemed to be telling him that this shadow hand was something that he needed to be careful of.

"I'm not sure how well this will work on someone like you, but if I want to stop this, and to continue to protect the Earth, then I need to improve every aspect of myself, no matter what different types of enemies I face!"
