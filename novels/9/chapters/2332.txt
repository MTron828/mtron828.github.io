Quinn was listening to everything Agent 4 said, and so far it made sense and added up. He too had the same thoughts, war was only profitable for Immortui. Having experienced a part of his power, and how many he could control, who knew how involved Immortui actually was in each of the battles Quinn had been a part of so far.

'He said it himself.' Quinn thought. 'That I had gotten in the way of his plans time and time again, but it was by accident, more of a byproduct of what I was doing, and now I'm one of the people that can open these holes, so that's why he's after me.'

"So that's why he's after me." Jessica said.

Quinn looked at his own hands for a moment, wondering if his own thoughts had been said out loud on accident, but he soon realised that it hadn't come from him.

"You know how to open a portal to the other side?" Hikel said. "I thought only Richard was capable of something like that."

"I don't." Jessica said a little reserved. "I might sound a little crazy, but in my head it's the only thing that makes sense. You said it yourself that Immortui has to be after me for some reason, and I keep having these dreams. REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

"That, the vampires, they find out about what I am, that I'm a dhampir, and then all of this built up energy inside me releases, shooting up into a sky opening up some kind of red portal."

Her hands were shaking as she was telling the story, they could tell that it was all very real to her.

"What if I do it by accident, what if I open this portal. If he can control people from this other world, then what can he do if he's in our world?"

Logan and Agent 4 smirked at this comment, as the two of them knew something the others didn't.

"We have both done a lot of reserch into this, after the last time a portal was opened and a demon manged to come through." Logan started to explain, showing a few video illustrations to everyone.

Quinn remembered well, the demons were quite strong for what they were, he could only imagine what type of creatures this other plane had, because it wasn't just Immortui that they would have to worry about.

Only those on the level of Minny and perhaps the originals were able to fight against the demons, and if they were to go up against one of those generals, then they would need Sil, Russ, Chris and so on, but they were also busy doing their own thing.

"There is another reason why Immortui needs a dedicated follower." Logan continued. "The universe itself has several places where it is close to other planes. Sometimes things may even be able to cross over. A good example of this are the familiers the vampires use. The vampire planet was on a plane similar to theirs which was why random familiars would appear.

"However, their world is not linked to ours. No matter how far you travelled in our universe you would not find them, the same as with Immortui."

"When I had the red heart." Agent 4 added. "I was sent to a specific location, a place where the bond between the two worlds was closer, that way less energy would need to be used, but as for the other thing Immortui needs, he needs someone who can draw the magic circle for him.

"Energy is just energy at the end of the day, and the magic circle is what allows it to be directed to a certain place. Which is why, we think Magnus is very important in all of this. The patterns and symbols that are needed to be drawn aren't so simple‚Ä¶ for some reason, it appears not everyone can draw a magic circle even if they are to copy one.

"Which is why he won't just be able to use anyone he can control."

Hearing all of this, for Quinn it was just cementing his belief that Immortui himself needed to be dealt with, there was Laxmus, Zero, and now Magnus. Who knew who else there was and who there would be in the future.

"So what am I meant to do?" Jessica said. "Am I meant to just hide here, while he takes over the Vampire Corps, using them as his pawns to look for me. My friends that I worked with died because of this, and it's possible that more and more people will die, and continue to die.

"So, is that what I'm supposed to do, just wait until Quinn, or Andy or someone else solves this?"

She had been through a lot, so everyone could understand her frustration, espeically Quinn because he felt the same way. They were stuck, but when explaining everything to Logan, he seemed to have a solution.

"Your main goal is to stop Magnus right?" Logan said. "Then based on everything we know so far, there is a way to stop this, and stop others getting hurt. My suggestion is that we use Jessica as bait."

The other's eyes widened after trying so hard to protect her, they now want to put her out in the open.

"We know the Vampire Corps are after her, so let her be captured by the Vampire Corps. We don't exactly know what Magnus is going to do or Immortui's next move is, but we can predict their next move if we look at what options we have.

"If Jessica gets captured by the Vampire Corps, then at some point, Magnus will have to take her someplace else. They won't kill Jessica because they need her. If I put an untraceable device on her, then we will know where they have taken her.

"She will lead us to Magnus, and we can stop this. Of course, I made it sound simple, there is a lot of risk involved, especially for the person in question."

Logan looked towards Jessica in all of this, without her consent then they wouldn't be able to go through with this plan, and she had to rely on the fact that the others would be able to save her.

She was thinking about it, she had seen their strength, but was it enough? If Quinn was the one that was actually helping her, maybe she wouldn't hesitate to say yes. Looking deeply at Bake, there was a sense of trust.

"I'll do it, I don't want any more people to die, just because what I am, I need to face this fact, it's a fact that I can never change, so if there is something I can do about it, then I will." Jessica said pumping her fist.

With that said, the group was working away, Logan was making a special device that would be tagged on Jessica. In order for this plan to work perfectly, they had to feel like no one was protecting Jessica and that she wasn't seen with others.

Meanwhile Quinn had asked to speak to Agent 4, he had whispered in his ear when walking past, and now the two of them were in a different room compared to the others completely.

"I have a request‚Ä¶" Quinn went on to explain who he was, and went into detail about his request.

A large smile on Agent 4's face lit up.

"You really want to do that‚Ä¶ I guess I don't need to warn you about the large risks, but why?"

"There's a few reasons." Quinn answered. "A promise I made from long time ago? I don't even think any of the people I made that promise to are alive now, but I don't want to break it, and it's to stop all of this."

‚Äî‚Äî

Later that evening, at one of the Vampire Corps' bases, Jessica walked right in through the front door, and took a deep breath.

"My name is Jessica Clark. I am wanted for a case invovling Stacy Lue and Gabe Lue, I have come to turn my self in!" Jessica shouted.
