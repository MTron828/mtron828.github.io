Chapter 1731: Act like it.

The Amra around the arena stared at the stranger, all four of their arms covering their mouth after the shock. Despite how many were there, not one of them said a word, but they all had similar thoughts running through their minds. For one, the person in front of them wasn't an Amra.

And second, the person was only as big as their children. However, they were sure that he had overwhelming power, whatever he was. Someone who can take out all of the guards around in the area with just a hand movement was going to be something that these Amra people would tell their future generations for the centuries to come. Many felt this was the moment a new legend had begun.

"I thought he was just a humanoid beast... are there humanoid beasts that are this strong?" Gina thought.

Upon seeing Geo in trouble, the person who appeared in her mind was none other than Quinn. Heading in the direction where Geo last went, Gina was sure that he had taken Quinn to see Dober, and fortunately, her guess turned out to be correct.

And when she saw Quinn there, she didn't know what he could do, if he could or would be willing to do anything, but with tears in her eyes, she had pleaded Quinn to help Geo out and that he did.

"I'm starting to worry that our race is doomed if all humans are like you." Geo smiled as he pulled his upper body off from the ground.

"The funny thing is, I was thinking the same thing when I met you, but I can see that's not the case," Quinn chuckled, giving Geo a hand and pulling him off the ground.

It was an easy task for Quinn, but this was the first time Geo had felt the others' strength.

He couldn't help but wonder how such small hands contained so much power, and this was when Geo realised that perhaps he had this little person all wrong. But his smile soon disappeared, and a sombre expression appeared on his face.

"You must leave and get away from here. Quinn. I am grateful for your help and I know you only meant well, but those people in the Tower will pin all of this on you and send even more people to take you down." Geo pleaded.

"You want me to leave? Then what about you? What were you planning to do if I ran away? Won't they blame you for everything that happened?"

"Even if they don't, Geo, now that I have gotten involved, they will blame you for bringing me here." Quinn replied.

"Anyway, I wanted to speak with the higher ups of the Tower and this incident can be a good chance for me."

It was then that a particular individual started to get back up from the ground. He touched his head, where there was a slight crack. Looking at the ground, he could see the hardball broken to pieces.

"I was knocked out by this ball?" Nock thought, jumping to his feet.

"Who did this? Who dared to attack a Tower Captain?!" Nock shouted aloud.

When looking around, he soon noticed that someone had beaten up all the other Tower Guards as well. His anger turned into shock and soon into fear as he stepped back.

Then looking at Geo, he gritted his teeth.

"Geo, you know what will happen now? You would have gotten away with a light slap on the wrist, but now that you have fought against us..." Nock said.

"It wasn't him. I was the one who attacked them." Quinn answered.

"As you can see, I'm not really from around here. So I wanted to speak to your leader. Someone said he was in that large tower of yours." He finished while pointing behind him.

"Before I could even ask my questions, everyone came charging in at me. Now maybe you can help me without trying to attack?"

It was unfathomable to Nock that whatever just happened was done by the tiny person in front of them. He wasn't even an Amra. So thinking that the others must have teamed up to help him, or at least Geo had, Nock charged forward towards Quinn.

With his arms clenched, Nock was ready to attack, and as soon as he was in the range of Quinn, he started to swing them all toward Quinn. Seeing this sight in front of him made Quinn smile as he remembered something.

"This man reminds me a bit of the Block block game." Quinn thought.

Thinking like this, Quinn didn't attack back and did what he would have done if it was a game. He went ahead and blocked every single one of the four armed alien's punches. Even if Nock punched two areas simultaneously, Quinn would use his leg and arms to block the attack.

On top of that, Quinn could move his hand fast enough to block both hits before they would hit his body. This shocked everyone on the scene, including Nock, but the latter just increased the intensity of his punches. But all this turned out to be for a nought.

"The others thought he must have been using some type of magic to attack, but it looks like he can actually fight as well." Geo thought.

"This isn't talent. He's controlling Nock's every move, this is experience. I wonder how many fights this man must have been through to get to this level."

Out of frustration, Nock used all four of his arms simultaneously, aiming to grab Quinn. The response from Quinn was a stomp on the ground with his right foot while building up his Qi energy in his fist. Then, throwing out a Qi infused hammer strike, Quinn smashed Nock in the stomach before it could reach him.

Nock skidded across the ground and used all four of his arms to balance himself somehow. He eventually did stop, which surprised Quinn a bit. This race certainly was resilient but not resilient enough. Nock suddenly coughed his mouth, and pink blood spilt out. He had been injured on the inside.

"You!" Nock shouted, spitting the blood, "You will pay." Íú∞ Ä·¥á·¥á·¥°·¥á ô…¥·¥è·¥†·¥á ü.·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ç

Pressing something on top of the strange helmet he wore, Nock started speaking and sending a report and asking for help from those in the Tower. Halfway up the Tower, in a giant bulti colosseum like structure, there were Amras in decorative red and black armour. This was the 50th floor, where the Sedi ranked tower members were. Around five of them stood around a pool of water.

The water surface was acting like a screen and in it was the picture of Nock, who was reporting the situation.

"Usually, most of our emergency calls aren't so drastic, but this seems to be the real deal?" One of the Sedi said to the others.

"I heard Athos directly asked the level 25 and under to search for someone or something. I have never heard him make such a request before."

The pool of water started to look towards Quinn, who stood there confidently.

"I find it hard to believe that this is the one that has Athos worried."

"Either way, I think we should deal with the problem before it becomes more troublesome for those in the city."

The Sedi ranked walked up to a rack placed on the side, and in it, there were several different coloured rocks. These were made of minerals that had never been seen on earth before and were of substances harder than Glathrium or diamond.

"You will destroy the whole neighbourhood with that." One of the Sedi frowned. "This might escalate the trouble."

"I'm sure Athos would rather have us get rid of the problem." The Sedi shrugged and headed to his right.

They were close to the centre of the floor, and after walking a few steps, the Sedi increased his pace. He swiftly passed by the buildings on the floor and soon reached the edge. There, there was a small window overlooking the city.

They were so high up that everything looked so small, but the Sedi could see just fine. He held the green coloured rock in his hand, and then carefully aiming it, he threw it with all his strength directly in a certain direction.

As it hit the clouds in the air, it dispersed them and many next to it, shifting them far away, making the sky clear. The speed and power behind the throw created flames around the rock, but it did not get smaller or change in size.Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

As the rock got closer to the buildings and went past them, it shook them just by the shockwaves.

"Move," Quinn said to Geo, noticing the energy coming toward them.

Geo wasn't quite sure what was happening but soon saw something in the distance and did as Quinn stated. In the next second, the ground was lifted as the rock slammed into Quinn's hands.

For the first time Quinn felt his body being pushed back on the ground, and the impact even tore off part of his clothing from his shirt, but his demon tier chest piece and his gauntlets stayed intact until finally.

Quinn stopped, and he had the green rock in his hand.

"That rock... it's from a Sedi!" Gina said out loud, and the others knew it as well.

This stone was the strongest mineral kept in the Tower. Everyone had heard of the stories and legends about these rocks, but this was the first time they saw it.

Holding it, Quinn clenched his fist, and the rock crumbled into dust and fell to the ground.

"This man, how? How could he survive an attack from a Sedi." Nock thought. "His power....what level is it at."

Quinn looked towards the Tower where the attack had come from. In truth, it had hurt him a little putting pressure on his elbows.

"What would happen if I were to directly attack the tower?" Quinn asked.

"That... it would be impossible, but if you were successful, maybe Athos himself would come down." Geo answered.

Looking at his hand, Quinn made a quick cut on it and started to gather his celestial energy as he looked at the large Tower.

"Well, since I'm a God, I guess I should start acting like one," Quinn replied, as all the Celestial Energy amassed out and formed something in his hand that looked similar to a spear.

"A God...?" Geo repeated, wondering if he had misheard.
