The large sword made of blood was hovering in the air, Andy was looking at it in amazement. He had never seen so much blood aura being used in a pure form like so. He had seen Quinn fight a few times, but never directly and never like this.

It was quite clear that the rumours of the accomplishments that he was able to achieve, that they weren't exaggerated in the slightest, if anything they were downplayed.

Even the original leaders looking at Quinn doing something with such ease, just felt like if they were with him, they could do anything.

"Let's get Jessica!" Quinn said, as he swung his hands down, the blood sword moved with it. The giant sword looked as if it was a weapon that had fallen from the heavens, fallen from some kind of giant in the skies.

From down below, each of them looked up, as they could feel the energy and the large shadow that was cast above them.

"What in the world, what is that!" One of the vampires shouted and pointed, looking at the sky.

Although they were all in the facility hidden by the magic, they could still see everything clearly from their side and that included the sword.

As it touched the trees, a bubble of energy was seen flashing around the place. The sword had red sparks surrounding it, as it was trying to get through whatever the shield was around it.

"I can see it, I can see the facility!" Andy stated, looking out the window.

What were just trees moments ago, now was a large facility and looking closely they could see Jessica tied up. However, the large blood sword hadn't pierced through the shield that was protecting the place. The power of the sword was still pulsating aura around the whole thing, and it looked like the shield was doing the same back.

"Will the shield hold up?" Barbra asked. Not only her, but the rest of the vampires were concerned, because if the shield was to break, then whoever had created that thing in the first place would have free reign to attack them all.

"The shield is not easy to break. There are countless magic circles built around the facility." Magnus answered. "We have used all the resources we had to power these magic circles. All the demon-tier crystals we have gathered and the demi-god tier crystals as well. There's a lot of power in this shield, if it was going to break, then it would have broken already."

Hearing all of the vampires mumbling to each other, there was one thing Jessica realised, not all of them were being mind controlled by the being called Immortui. From the sounds of it, many were willingly helping him like Magnus, and that included Barbra.

When one was being controlled or forced to do things, Immortui would take over their actions, but in this case, they were still acting like themselves. She wondered what had Immortui promised them, what had he done for them to go over to his side.

Regardless, all of the commotion had caused her to raise her head, and when she looked up at the large blood sword, she could also see a ship not too far off from it.

'Is it them, did they come to… save me?' Jessica thought.

She wondered who would have such power though, to break the shield, maybe if there were more of the original leaders then they could produce something like this, but Jsssica was overestimating the original leaders. Without the absolute blood control that was given to the kings, it would have been near impossible for them to do something like this.

In the ship itself, they could see that the large blood sword wasn't going to be enough to break the barrier, and eventually all of the energy from the sword would disappear.

"The sword isn't enough, it needs more power." Edvard stated. "Should we help? If we use all our strength and our attacks as well, maybe we can break the barrier!"

The other leaders and Andy nodded, but Logan remained calm.

"Everyone, you can do your part when it is needed, but for now you should trust Quinn, do you really think this is the only thing he can do? This is the man who can overcome anything."

It was true, if possible Quinn didn't want to go all out in this attack, and the reason was simple, because he didn't want to hurt Jessica by accident, nor did he want to hurt anyone that was possibly being controlled by Immortui.

Using his hands again, he gathered energy, and soon, right above the island, something else was forming. More correctly, there were two objects that were forming in the air. The blood aura started to gather the same as before, aura coming out from his hands and the red in Quinn's eyes growing stronger.

When everyone could finally see what Quinn had created they were left blown away.

"Just how much blood aura… does this guy have?" Edvard said.

'I will just say that I am happy that I decided never to go against him properly when I was unsure about who he was. I feel a bit sorry for Grenlet now. Now I understand why he would break down whenever he heard Quinn's name.'

In the air, hovering from the clouds, there were two more giant blood swords, they were just as large as the first one, and had just as much condensed blood energy as well.

"Fall." Quinn said, his eyes glinting red for a second. As the command was given the two large swords dropped down.

They crashed into the shield and now all three swords pulsed with energy. The shield looked like it was ready to crumble at any moment, yet it still managed to hold up, but it didn't seem like it would be the case for so much longer.

"Just one more push!" Quinn, with his blood control, now controlled the swords, pushing them further into the shield, and empowering them with the third stage of Qi from a distance. The vast amount of power crashed into and crushed the shield in an instant.

The swords were still there, while the shield was broken.

"You said the shield would hold out!" Barbra said.

"It would have, if we were going up against an ordinary opponent" Magnus replied. "It looks like the star of the show has eventually turned up."

Jessica, seeing the shield having broken, and the three large blood swords, she couldn't believe there was such power. There was only one person in her mind that was capable of doing such a thing.

A lump was building up in her throat, as she thought about who it could be.

'No, it couldn't be, why would he come for me, why would he care for me. I'm not anyone important to him. He has his own family to protect, a whole settlement to run.' Jessica told herself, but she wanted to believe it was him.

"What are we going to do, if we just stand here those blood swords will kill us!" Barbra shouted.

"Don't worry, I have analysed his personality well." Magnus said, as the blood swords were falling toward them. "He won't kill us, he is too worried about hurting people, and he especially wouldn't want to hurt her."

The blood swords continued to fall until they were only ten metres away from hitting the facility. They stayed in the air, directly in front of them for a few moments. All of the vampires could feel the powerful energy.

Even if they were to attack the swords together with all of their might, they believed that they would have never been able to disperse the blood swords.

Yet, they exploded into blood particles at that moment, turning into nothing but red dust.

"See, what did I tell you, we don't have to worry about the swords… this man is to mentally weak to win this battle against us. He will never be able to beat Immortui."

The ship was seen hovering above, and it was time for them to descend. The top of the space ship's glass door opened up, and everyone was ready.

"Me and Agent 4 will wait above, and will come to support you when the area is cleared up." Logan stated.

The others nodded.

"It's time for us to go." Quinn said, as he jumped first off the ship toward the facility. The rest quickly followed him, jumping out after him.

All of them were falling to the ground, the vampires below seeing this, readied their powers, and started to fire out blood aura toward them. Blood swipes, blood bullets, beast weapons mixed with blood, all sorts of attacks went towards them.

The others were ready to attack back to block the attacks, but Quinn spread out the shadow from around him, covering the area where they were, including the others, as the attacks hit the shadow, they were unable to do anything.

Finally, Quinn and the others landed right on the ground, in the middle of the facility, unhurt, without a scratch on their body.

"Magnus." Quinn said. "Today is the day you die."
