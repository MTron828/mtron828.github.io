Chapter 966 - The Cursed faction Influence (Part 2)

For a second, Venus and Swin were happy to see General Hardy, but soon after realising their dark situation, even they thought that it might be difficult for him to help them, and the intense energy radiating off from him was just scaring them even more.

"There seems to have been an incident involving your students here from group 2 and my students form group 3." Innu claimed. "The one that has been brought in has been hurt the most, but not only that, he and his family are an important asset to the military.

"They are a great sponsor of ours, which only makes matters even more serious to the point where we have had to call you in."

Saying these words. Erlen’s father had a smug look on his face, as if he was proud. He sorted out and fixed up his suit a little more to make sure he looked the part. It was as if his looks were more important than the situation they were all currently in.

"Six of our students had been beaten by the five that have been brought in here today, they were the cause of all of this. The damage is as follows, a concussed head, several broken ribs, a twisted arm, missing teeth and finally to our student Erlen here. A stab wound in his side, and blunt blow to the back of his head, seems to have been done with a heavy object of some kind.

"I don’t have to tell you that some of these wounds could have been fatal. If it was a simple fight then maybe it could have been overlooked, but something could have easily gone wrong and the outcome could have been worse."

Erlen’s father stood up and pointed towards Shiro.

"This boy that stabbed my son, if it wasn’t for my son’s quick thinking then he might have died. Luckily my son is talented and had used his abilities to stop the wound from becoming worse." He said, sitting back down in his seats and straightening out his blazer once more.

All of them that were sitting in the chair, hearing the accusations made out as they were, didn’t really know what to say. Based on what they had seen Sil do, it didn’t seem like they were making any of the injuries up.

Although, Swin and Venus were wondering what to say themselves, after all, they hadn’t hurt any of the pupils, so why should a punishment fall on them? And most of all, what of their parents if they did claim that nothing had happened?

Quinn had finally heard enough to speak up a little on his own.

"If I may ask, General Innu, did you know there was an incident involving some of the students here and students from your class before today? If I was a gambling man I would have to think that the incident that happened the other day, is linked to this one as well."

Seeing what Quinn was trying to do, Erlen was the one to first speak up about it.

"It’s true." Erlen said. "Me, Venus and Swin used to be friends out of our schools. We knew each other and we had a falling out the other day, we got into a scuffle and we were both beaten, but I didn’t expect them to ambush us the very next day and try to use a weapon. They even called their new friends they made."

Erlen, was putting on an Oscar worthy performance making it look like he was the victim in all of this. Quinn could imagine if it was another general, due to the other family’s position and connections with the military they would take their side.

Looking over to Chucky, Quinn could see him shaking his head, calming what they said wasn’t true at all.

Seeing how his son seemed to be quite upset at what happened, Erlen’s father stood up in anger.

"I won’t accept anything but begging from these students, they should be l.i.c.k.i.n.g the floor and apologising for what they did. If the military doesn’t give them an appropriate punishment they can kiss their contracts goodbye! We, the Tiffle family, will not tolerate this!" The father declared.

Hearing this, for a second, both Venus and Swin wanted to immediately get on the floor and apologise, they didn’t care if they were really in the wrong or not, but they needed to make sure. That their parents wouldn’t be affected.

"If we do that, if we do that, then will you give our parents their jobs back!" Venus shouted, as he pleaded.

Everyone in the room was quite stunned by this, but the other Generals expected something like this might happen. Although it did not happen often, there were occasions where parents ended up getting involved in their kids’ disputes.

However, what Samantha was concerned about was the strange atmosphere that had just gotten heavy in the room.

"What did you say he did?" Quinn asked, as his fingertips had dug straight through the sofa.

"Please, we’re really sorry!" Swin pleaded. "We will do whatever you ask, but our parents already work so hard for us." Swin said, already on his knees on the ground.

"As you can see General Hardy, this is a serious matter for the military, I think if the students at least apologise we can lighten their punishment." Innu said, a bit worried himself, not realising that the father would go this far for his son. "I hope we do not need to escalate this to the point where Oscar has to get involved."

Quinn didn’t look up, and lifted Swin off the ground. He felt so light as he placed him back in his seat.

"No one should have to get on their knees, especially if they did nothing wrong." Quinn said softly, while his back was turned to the others.

"Do you really think it makes sense for a bunch of low levels, who are even weaker than your son and his gang, to attack a group of high levels? You want me to believe that they were the ones that started this mess. That they would really instigate a fight knowing full well that they would lose?" Quinn questioned them.

"Who even are you, General Hardy?!" Erlen’s father shouted back. "Don’t you know how this world works? Who cares who attacked who first! The crimes committed by those children are unforgivable. They attacked some important people that are vital for our society. We should be respected for all we are doing for this war, and what have they done! They dare to even attempt to attack us or argue with us!"

Samantha urgently wanted to step in at this point. As she didn’t know what General Hardy might do. She knew the connections the Tiffle family had with the military.

’Surely, just a random member of the Cursed family can’t be that important? We can just comply for now and apologise to those in the Cursed.’ She thought, but no matter what, she couldn’t step in.

"So you people really don’t understand or learn, until you get a taste of your own medicine." Quinn said, turning around and looking at Erlen’s father.

Seeing General Hardy’s eyes, she was just thankful that they weren’t glowing red like last time. But why did he seem so confident?

"Oh, you’re calling me while you’re away. I assume that something has come up that you need my expertise with?" Logan said.

The others looked at this young boy and didn’t have a clue who he was, or why Hardy had decided to make a call in the middle of the situation they were in.

"I don’t usually ask you for favours Logan, but this time I had to-"

"Don’t say anything else, you will upset me if you do. Tell me what you need." Logan replied.

Before saying anything, Quinn looked at Erlen and his father. He could still see that they weren’t worried, or cared at all how they had just treated several lower ranking students and their families.

"Look into a family called the Tiffle family for me please." Quinn requested.

Some typing was heard, and it didn’t take long for Logan to bring up their information.

"It looks like the family has a lot of connections with the military, they own a lot of manufacturing plants that mostly help produce the Mechs for the military amongst other things. What’s the problem with them, are they causing trouble?" Logan asked, calmly.

"How long would it take to bring them down?" Quinn asked.

Hearing these words, nearly everyone in the room was stunned. The kids, the Generals and even Erlen’s father. However, they all assumed it was merely a bluff.

"I think I can gather what has happened, let me sort it out." Logan said and the call had ended there.

"You think your little fake call is going to scare me. I’ve had enough, call the Supreme Commander immediately!" Erlen’s father demanded.

However, a few moments later, his own watch started going off. Looking down he could see it was an important call that he had to take. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

"Sir! Sir! We have a problem, our company, we’ve been bought out!" The caller said.

"How is that possible, our group would never have sold!"

"They had no choice sir. We no longer have access to any of our systems or databases. It was a complete take-over that happened in seconds, but somehow they managed to halt production immediately. An offer was then made from the Green family, that they wouldn’t allow us to continue production, complete our contracts unless we sold. Even if we wanted to do anything we couldn’t and Sir, I’m afraid I have even more bad news. The first decision the new director had ordered to be done, was to get rid of all the executive staff and other directors."

Soon there was more bad news as the Tiffle’s personal accounts were taken over, and multiple pings form his accounts were being sent to him.

"What is happening!" Erlen’s father panicked, as he went on the floor, grabbing his hair. Everything was hitting him at once and he was slowly beginning to make sense of it all. His stomach was churning and his head started to spin and the only comfort he had was being on the floor. Looking up, he saw Quinn, who was looking down at him. "Please! It was you, wasn’t it? I’m sorry, I’m sorry!" He shouted.

Quinn stared at the man on the floor, who was almost begging, and stepped away before he could grab on to his feet.

"Father, I don’t understand! What’s happening?!" Erlen started to panic.

A ping was received on Quinn’s watch, and it was a message from Logan.

"Your company and all of its productions will continue to operate as normal. However, you nor your family, will no longer own it anymore." Quinn read.

Turning away, he left the man. "Come on, let’s go." Quinn said, as he walked out of the front door. Sil and Chucky stood up following him out, and the other students quickly followed close behind.

Shiro couldn’t believe what he had just seen happen. Why would a General get so involved in all of this, just for a couple of students? Taking down a corporation of that size couldn’t have been easy.

As Quinn left that door, everyone was thinking, ’who the hell was this person?’
