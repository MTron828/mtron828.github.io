Chapter 1072 - A how many spike?

Arriving on planet Getentoch, was Owen Graylash, and with him, he had a strong force of fifty thousand. If one was to see this, who had never seen a Dalki before, they would have said it was overkill, sending that many people for only a force against 200 Dalki?

For those that had faced the Dalki before, they would have thought it wasn‚Äôt enough. Very few people could take on even a one spiked Dalki, which was why even with ability users, the introduction of Mech‚Äôs and beast weapons was a game-changer.

Before, a single one spiked Dalki could have taken on thousands of people, and even more before the introduction of abilities and beast gear.

However, the force brought wasn‚Äôt just ordinary people. They were All Travelers, and there wasn‚Äôt a single one under the Rank of B, but there was a reason why Owen had to come himself, why he felt like he had no choice.

Planet Getentoch was a red coloured planet with a vast wasteland with deep trenches here and there. It was also a strange planet that would suffer from lack of rainfall for half a year or so and then be plagued with rain for the next half a year.

Currently, the Graylash group had sent all the civilians off the planet, and we‚Äôre making upgrades to the Shelter. A few of the earth users were building several walls, so they could form a tight defence.

Owen was standing on top of a large tower at the very back of the Shelter, with his usual fan covering his face and his long straight hair.

"If we were here during the rainfall, it would make the task quite easy. However, it seems like luck isn‚Äôt on our side today." Owen said. "Still, when have I ever relied on things such as luck." Owen turned to one of his men by his side and smiled. "Right?"

"Of course, sir!" The man replied. "We will win this fight, even if the sun scorches our bodies like lava!"

Although they had prepared for situations like this, they were having more trouble than they had expected for many reasons. It turned out that it was true that the Dalki were able to create some sort of teleporter jamming device. The teleporters on the planet itself didn‚Äôt work. They had to escort the citizens off from the planet over to the Graylash main ship nearby.

However, worried that these might be attacked, quite a large force was sent with them, diminishing the forces that would also be on the planet itself. While they were unsure if the Dalki were affected by this teleportation device.

Lastly, the real reason why Owen was here was because of the rumours, rumours that the Dalki forces this time, we‚Äôre being led by a four spiked Dalki. Owen had to come no matter how small the number of forces being sent from the Dalki side.

‚ÄôBack then, the four spiked Dalki that appeared was what made even my grandfather come out of hiding.‚Äô Owen started to remember. ‚ÄôIt was a great struggle, but the current world leaders at the time had managed to defeat it. His advice to me was if I ever saw a four spiked Dalki and I was to face one on my own, then I was to run.‚Äô

Closing his fan, Owen looked off into the distance. Multiple black pods were sent down from one of the large Dalki sh.i.p.s a few hours ago. They were quick and small, making it hard for them to shoot down before they reached the planet.

"I‚Äôm sorry, I won‚Äôt be taking your advice. Let‚Äôs see if you were the right grandfather." Owen said.

"Sir, I have just received a report. The Dalki, some of them seem to have boarded on the second ship!" The man reported quite urgently.

"It looks like they have chosen now of all times to attack. It can‚Äôt be a coincidence. I assume the forces sent to attack the fleet aren‚Äôt weak either. Is there anyone close by that can help?" Owen asked.

Usually, he would have gone back as quick as anything to help his own people. Yet, something in Owen‚Äôs mind was telling him he needed to remain here. Otherwise, it would be a loss for the human race.

"I have already sent out the message to the nearby planets in the area as a warning for the other planets to be careful. Although I did not send a request for help. The nearby forces are weaker than what is currently on the ship, so it wouldn‚Äôt make sense. The only one that could help in such a situation would be Head General Robin, but I have received news that he passed away. I would give you details, but we are running out of time." The man explained.

"Passed away, Robin was a good man, and strong. It looks like the Cursed faction had quite the trouble defeating the Demon tier beast. Give the Cursed faction all the information about the current attack and details of the second fleet. I will let them decide what they need to do." Owen Said.

"And that is the current situation the Graylash family are facing," Sam said as he finished his report.

Those in the room were frightened. In the report Sam gave, they even talked about the four spiked Dalki in the attack. It made everyone feel goosebumps on their body for fear of what might happen to Owen.

Owen was strong, all of the leaders were strong, but the only reason the human race stood a chance last time was more due to their sheer numbers. Of course, their numbers now dwindled in comparison compared to the last time. However, they had focused on building up strength but have they managed to close that gap to the point where Owen could defeat a four spiked Dalki? That they didn‚Äôt know.

"Would you like my opinion on the matter, or do you have something you wish to do?" Sam said.

"We should send people to help Owen fight against the four spiked Dalki," Ko announced. "That‚Äôs the only reasonable thing to do. The second fleet of the Graylash will have to take care of themselves. I can‚Äôt imagine the attack on them will be as bad as the one that Owen is facing. If we win this, then it is a big step forward."

"But don‚Äôt you think the current fight with Owen is just a delay?" Linda replied.

"I have to agree," Sam said. "It is possible that they leaked the information on the four spiked Dalki to us. That way, they knew we would send a strong force to help them, such as Owen. While Owen is caught up, they are able to send forces to destroy the other forces, slowly taking our numbers down, while Owen continues to be caught up."

Quinn had been silent as he was thinking of what to do, and he had finally come up with his answer.

"We should trust Owen. He‚Äôs strong, and I think he knows what he is doing. Just now, you told us he had given all the information there was about the Graylash second fleet and ship. I don‚Äôt think he is an idiot. He trust‚Äôs his own strength, and we need to trust he can deal with the four spiked Dalki on his own."

Although Quinn said this, he was slightly worried, a four spiked Dalki was something he had never faced, and their strength grew exponentially with each spike. Even Borden was impressive as a temporary three spike, so who knows what a four spike could do.

"As for me, I will head to the second fleet, alone." Said Quinn.

"Alone, are you crazy!" Ely stood up from his seat. "It might not be a four spiked Dalki, but there will be more on board. You can‚Äôt take them on alone!"

"I think it might be the best thing to do." Sam agreed. "You see, we don‚Äôt know how strong the Dalki are that have been sent to attack the second fleet. What we do know is they are in great trouble. However, the Cursed forces are in an entirely different place. Sending everyone here to fight them would be useless."

"Not only that," Quinn added. "I‚Äôm the only one that can return with no problems. It seems like the Dalki can block the teleporters, which means that the second fleet are unable to escape. If they are too strong even for me, then I‚Äôm the only person that can still get out of there with my ability.

"I will be going alone, and that‚Äôs an order," Quinn said, which was now the second time he had used his authority as one of the world leaders.
