What was Immortui talking about right now? Was he just rambling on, was he trying to convince Quinn by making promises to bring back the dead, just how he had convinced Zero and the others as well? He knew how that went for them, and it didn't end well. 

"What are you talking about? Take everything back? Are you saying you can bring back the dead?" Quinn asked.

"As expected, those Ancient Ones told you nothing." Immortui smiled. "The energy in the universe is constantly growing. The energy never lessens and continues to grow just like the universe. More lives are born than in the past and the celestials' powers grow in turn. 

"What is important to note about what I said, is that the energy never fades away. The energy in the universe simply gets moved about, this is true even in death. There is a reason why the celestials are obsessed with completing their conditions, including the Ancient Ones, it is because it gives them more energy to use, gives them more energy to warp the universe the way they wish. 

"For me it is true as well. When I had gained a mass amount of celestial energy a new power was unlocked in me too. I had obtained the power to control this energy and in particular the energy of the dead. 

"As I stated before, energy is never lost, it just passes through in different places, to different areas. Even here, the energy all around us, comes from the world of the dead. It leaks in, mixing with all the inhabitants, making them have an urge to continue on killing. 

"I'm sure you've seen it, the demon kings have the power to control this energy of the dead, and it is the same for me. I can make a connection with those on the brink of death and bring them back, giving them the energy that they lost in that moment."

Quinn didn't quite understand where this was going, but he imagined this was how Immortui was able to convince the others. There were of course many that he would have wished to have brought back, Arthur and Leo to name a few, there were too many that had been lost. 

"So you are saying you can bring back the dead, if you can then bring them back now, and I might consider helping you.' 

Immortui just chuckled. 

"I can not bring back the dead." Immortui satted. "My power is closely linked with death, I can just save someone on the brink of death. I can, in some capacity, bring back the dead, but they would only be a fraction, an empty shell of what they were. 

"They would possibly have the same power, but memories, feelings, things like that would no longer exist. It would be hard to say that they are the same person." 

It came as a surprise that Immortui was actually honest. He could have just lied to Quinn saying he would bring them back, so why would he tell Quinn this. 

"However, there is a way to bring back everyone you cared about. Remember what I said, the more powerful a celestial is, the more energy they have, the more they are able to control this energy. One example is the energy I can use with the dead, as for the celestials they have the energy to control time itself." Immortui explained.

"I'm sure you've seen it for yourself. The celestial space has a completely different time compared to others. That messenger of theirs, Mundus, who can freeze time within a time frame. With all the Ancient Ones put together they can change the universe back to the way it once was."

Quinn had heard about this, he thought about the possibility of it as well. There were powers that could even do things on a small scale, so what was being said wasn't out of the realm of possibility. 

"But if we were to do that, won't everything change? That includes everything you have done. Wouldn't I have to go through it all again?" Quinn asked. 

"No." Immortui answered. "God-slayers and Celestials are different beings. There is a reason why the Ancient Ones have become so vain to call ourselves gods or place god in the name. We are unaffected by the powers of celestial energy. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

"Time can be changed for the Universe itself, going back to the way it was, energy being converted back to what it once was, but the celestials and the god slayers, they will remain intact and will remember everything. You can have everything you desire, bringing back those you care about while losing nothing. 

"The difference will be, I will be at the top of the gods and I will make sure to not bring unjustice to those that naturally race up. You, due to your strength, will have anything you want, live the life you wished to live without any interference from higher beings!"

Bringing back the people he lost, it sounded like an amazing thing initially but what did it actually mean. What about those that weren't celestials and god slayers. Would Minny and Layla be reverted back to the time at the military academy, would she live a life without him being there? 

Although he would keep all of his memories, all the memories that they spent together would be lost, and essentially that life that was lived, everything everyone went through would be gone as well. 

The lives that had already been made, due to the connections that people had because of what they had been together would be all lost. Because what, the universe, the people were all just forms of energy. 

Energy that would be reverted back to a certain point? If Quinn was to make a decision like that, all the current lives, everything would be destroyed in a sense. Who was he to make a decision like that, what right did he have to affect so many lives? He was just a regular being who wanted to look after the lives of those he cared about. 

Quinn had pretty much made up his mind, he would stop Immortui. If he didn't join him, if Immortui got his way, there was a good chance that his current life, everyone's current life, would be destroyed as Immortui did a great restart on the world.

"I… I don't even know how to break you out of here." Quinn said. "As I said before, why do you need me?" 

Immortui paused for a second, the smile completely dropped from his face. 

"I can tell, you don't… believe in me." Immortui said. "Do you know how long I've lived? Do you really think I'm a fool? I know, you right now, you don't have any intention of working with me, I can tell by the tone of your voice, you have made your decision. 

"So why are you asking me a useless question like that? I know, you're trying to buy time, I guess I've done enough talking."

Stretching out both of his arms, Immortui placed them by his waist, and a ball of aura started to grow around both of them. Once again, the same thing as Quinn had seen before, he could see now. 

The area where his aura was extending, it was just black and white, and a few greys. No colour could be seen, as the power from his fists radiated and had a monochrome effect, as if it was taking the life out of the very air itself.

Meanwhile neither Quinn's demon from, nor his armour had returned.
