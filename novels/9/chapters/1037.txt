Chapter 1038 - The secrets of a clone

What everyone assumed to be a clone of Eno, was strapped up into a chair with the special restraints on his arms and legs. Logan was quite confident this could hold a vampire but would constantly look back, wondering when he would wake up. Needles had been injected into him for sedation while Logan was running a few tests.

When looking at what was happening to Eno right now, even if it was a clone, Quinn felt a little bad. He somewhat used to imagine this was what his life would be subjected to if they ever found out about his secret.

’You can’t feel bad Quinn, remember you would have never done such things if for one, Eno was straight up and honest with you.’ Vincent said. ’And two, Eno attempted to attack those in your group first.’ 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was true, Eno actions in the end had led Quinn to do this, and in a way it wasn’t like they were torturing him. In fact, Logan wasn’t doing much to Eno, other than taking a few samples here and there, what was clear to them was that this Eno was a vampire and was treated like one.

Any wounds that would be made on his body would heal at a fast rate, and his cells had a reaction to human blood. After testing for a few hours, it looked like Logan was finally done, but he wasn’t jumping for joy or had much of a reaction.

"I guess you didn’t find the answer you were looking for?" Said Quinn.

Logan shook his head.

"I can answer a few of the questions we might have had, but I don’t think it was what we were looking for Quinn." Logan answered. "It’s quite clear that this Eno is a clone. Based on what you have told me. When looking for MC cells there seems to be none. What I’m not sure about is if it’s because the body can’t produce MC cells or if it’s out of choice.

"When trying to reverse the process or create a cloning process similar to this clone, it seems to fail nearly every time. At least when trying to create a clone with another clone. I tried using the techniques I learnt from the vampire lab, the same way I created Borden and the same way I created my Dalki hand. I used my own blood but the cells just deteriorated too fast.

"I assume this was the original problem in the first place when creating a clone, and that’s why they needed to mix beast blood strong enough with human blood to sustain the clone. So I’m afraid I can’t create a body for Vorden and Sil. Maybe the way Eno does it now is different."

"What if you were to use my blood?" Quinn asked.

Perhaps they couldn’t create another human, but what about using vampire blood.

"I already attempted something like that at the vampire lab, where there were samples of vampire blood. It won’t work."

"If you were looking to find out anything else from this clone. Weather information is passed through each other or something else, I’m afraid I won’t be able to tell just with this equipment."

From their investigation at least they had gotten one answer. That Eno was somehow able to create clones of himself, which meant he probably could do something for Vorden and Raten. Looking at Logan now, he seemed a bit defeated, he didn;t turn his head away from the lab screen while talking to Quinn at all.

As if it was annoying him that he couldn’t figure out something that someone else could.

’The struggle of geniuses.’ Vincent sighed. ’You wouldn’t understand Quinn. Would you mind asking Logan if I can take a look at the data?’

When Quinn lived Vincent’s life, there were some things he experienced but he didn’t understand the way Vincent’s mind worked. He was able to see him experience and do things, but it was far too advanced and was just a bunch of numbers and strange letters to Quinn. Which was why he often forgot that Vincent was actually a great mind himself.

"Do you mind if I have a look at what you found out?" Quinn asked. Of course Logan was fine with letting him have a look, but didn’t have much hope that Quinn would spot something that he hadn’t done.

After reading through everything for a while and letting Vincent look at things, all Quinn kept hearing was a ’Ah I see’ or ’that makes sense.’ But nothing else, until eventually he explained what he had found out so far.

"It seems like your friend is facing a similar problem that I faced when I was also trying to create a blood substitute. There was a time when I also was trying to clone certain parts of a human but it wouldn’t work out, even with my ability it was quite impossible." Vincent explained.

"I think that your friend is missing one key bit of information here. Remember Eno is an original. Vampires may live a long life but they don’t live forever, even their cells die, but as for Originals, they can live on.

"Perhaps this is what Jim had thought back then as well. Using an original’s cells. Something that wouldn’t die would allow a person to create a perfect clone."

While Vincent explained this, Quinn also spoke out loud for Logan to hear as well, and due to the way Quinn was saying these words, Logan knew it wasn’t coming from him but from something or someone else. Perhaps his system.

The problem was, they didn’t have the real Eno in their possession at the moment to test out that theory.

However, Quinn was thinking about something else. It made sense that the Dalki were a failed experiment, but at the same time somewhat successful, but then how were the vampires able to create a blood substitute then?

This was something even Vincent didn’t know the answer to, due to it being after his time.

At that moment, Eno started to wake up, or more so he started to speak.

"Well, did you find everything you wished to find?"

Immediately, Quinn went up to Eno and looked at him. Quite frankly he had enough, he had kept his cool for too long, and didn’t want to keep messing around with another trouble.

"Eno enough playing games." Quinn said. "I know you might have been a king in the past. You’re some great original vampire that created the tenth family but right now I’m telling you two things. I’m the current leader of the tenth family and I’m the leader of the Cursed faction and everyone on this ship.

"To me you are none of those, and you have been messing with us for far too long."

"Are you saying this to me because you now know I’m the clone?" Eno replied. "Don’t you want to go and speak to the real Eno?" Quinn asked.

"Quite frankly, I don’t give a crap." Quinn said. "I know you know everything that the original Eno knows, and I just want you to answer some of my questions. You are on my ship and if you want to stay here you need to start following my orders.

"We have been doing well without you so far, and the Cursed faction can continue, you have been more trouble than good, I’ll find my own way to bring back Vorden and Raten. You can’t keep using that as blackmail."

The room was silent, with only four of them present and with Eno saying nothing. Quinn got up and gave out a sigh.

"Leo, do whatever you want with him." Quinn said. The next second, Leo drew his blade.

"Okay!" Eno shouted, giving out a big sigh after like it was tiring. "Okay, so that’s what you want right, just for me to answer your questions. Then fine, let’s talk about everything. Whatever you want to ask I’ll happily answer. I think I have tried to break your bonds for long enough. I never thought Humans vampires, turned humans who barely knew each other would honestly care for each other that much.

"But Quinn let me tell you this to start with. I decided not to kill Erin because you’re right, she is part of your group and you have been doing well so far, but do you even know why Dhampirs are so dangerous?" Eno said.

"From what I know, it’s just because the vampires are afraid. Afraid that there is a race that is stronger when fighting them, and can stay out in the sun." Quinn replied. "The vampires believe they are the strongest race and would never want something stronger than them to live."

At least, this was partly from Quinn’s own views from what he had learnt.

Grand laughter started to come from Eno’s chair.

"Is that what you believe, who told you all of this? Although this is somewhat true, that’s not the reason at all. You remember when you asked me about protecting vampires and humans? Well, you’re right. I do want to protect them both, and I believe that’s possible. However, if a Dhampir exists, that will never be possible. let me tell you the real reason why the vampires are so afraid of the Dhampirs." Eno said.
