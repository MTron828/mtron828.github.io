Chapter 989 - The fear of him

Before leaving the cursed ship, Quinn did his usual, getting an update status from Sam on things that were happening with the Cursed faction. After all, he was already on the ship to talk to them in person rather than through communication devices.

It also seemed like quite a few of the core team were busy doing other things, so it was good to know how they were doing.

In the command centre, Sam was a bit distracted. He was looking at files on the holographic display but at the same time seemingly doing nothing. Even when Quinn walked in, his face would have been seen through the files since they were slightly transparent, but Sam continued to stare at the screen blankly.

"Is everything okay, Sam?" Quinn asked, approaching him slowly. There were a few times he had seen him like this, but now Quinn was starting to wonder what could’ve happened that made him this way.

"Oh Quinn, yeah, everything is fine...I think anyway." Sam replied, gulping as well. He was a complete nervous wreck, and he had sweat running down his face. "It’s just, I think it’s too hard to explain. Why don’t you just go see Logan? It seems he has come back from his little trip. Just don’t attack him."

Now Quinn was really intrigued because Sam was simply making no sense. With the way he was, he wouldn’t have been able to get a clear answer from him anyway.

’Don’t attack him. Why would I ever attack Logan?’ Quinn thought, walking ahead to the research lab. When entering, he could see Logan busy working away as usual, and at the same time, he had his robotic arm covering most of his right arm, although it did seem a little bulkier than usual.

’Didn’t he want to get that fixed?’ Quinn thought.

"It seems you keep getting faster every time I see you," Logan said. "This arm is a little difficult to control."

"About that." Said Quinn. "Why did you make a bigger arm? Weren’t you going to replace it?"

A few seconds later, small little parts of steam were seen escaping from the robotic arm. It split apart in half and fell to the ground, revealing what could be seen underneath. A dark black arm with several scales all over. His fingers were larger than that of a human with fingernails that acted and looked more like dragon claws, although they seemed to have been shaven down for easier use.

"Logan, what the hell did you do! You said you had it all under control, and you would be fine. Are you now a Dalki!? Why would you do that to yourself?!" Quinn couldn’t understand at all. Surely Logan would have been better with a robotic arm, and if he could recreate a Dalki arm, why couldn’t he recreate a human arm.

"Quinn, I do have everything under control. I did this to myself on purpose, as to your question of why. Everyone has sacrificed so much. How many people have you turned due to them wanting power? Isn’t this the same? This way, I can finally be of help. I haven’t lost my ability either. They have made their sacrifice, and I have made mine."

In a way, Quinn understood what Logan felt, but he just didn’t realise Logan felt this way. He never thought Logan wanted power, and he was always a big asset to the Cursed group, that he had failed to realise how much Logan felt like he wasn’t a part of it.

"Besides, I am plenty human. I have put in measures that make it so the Dalki blood can’t spread to my body. It also seems to be less contagious as your vampire blood, which rapidly changes one’s body." Logan explained.

Looking at his arm, Quinn could see that halfway up past his elbow, there was what looked like a small little metal brace that was almost a part of Logan’s arm. Below it, the arm was all Dalki, while above was the rest of Logan’s body.

"I thought about it for a while, but perhaps if my parents didn’t just rely on their brains all the time, they would have been alive today. I need something to at least protect myself."

Quinn couldn’t argue with that. Although he wanted to protect everyone, there would definitely be times that he couldn’t.

"So, how is the arm?" Quinn asked out of curiosity.

"Why, don’t you see for yourself?" Logan said with a smile, and the next second, Quinn could see a fist coming towards him. His reaction was good, and he had blocked the hit holding his fist in place, but Quinn’s hand was shaking from the sheer power.

’It’s strong. It’s been a while since I have taken a Dalki’s power head on, but just how strong is the Dalki blood running through Logan, and does he still have the same effect as other Dalki?’ Quinn wondered.

"I know what questions you want to ask, but I still haven’t figured out everything myself yet. I need to get used to the arm first, and then I will be able to provide you with your answers."

Letting go of the punch, Quinn looked at the arm one more time.

"Your one crazy guy." Said Quinn.

"I believe that I am not as crazy as a certain vampire boy," Logan replied and got back to work.

Meanwhile, back on earth, inside the beast weapons class, Quinn’s students had just entered and were a little depressed. The energy was low. Of course, they would be as their substitute teacher Aden had constantly been telling them every day how horrible they were. How they had weak abilities, and they were even useless at fighting.

They saw the beast class as their one opportunity to still be seen as an asset to the outside world, but now they were being told they were horrible at this as well.

Aden, was in charge of two beast classes and was in charge of the Earthborn classes, so for today he decided to bring in five students from his main class.

"The reason I have brought these guys in today is to show you all just how far apart you are from them. You guys need to work harder, remember you will be fighting soon for points for your house. In return, these points will be used to upgrade your dorm facilities, and those who contribute the most points for their houses will be gifted with high-level beast crystals."

Just as he had finished his speech, it looked as if Aden had gotten a call.

"What happened!" He shouted over the receiver.

He quickly walked over to the five students that he had brought with him.

"Alright, I have to go for just a short while, but I’m going to leave you in the hands of Zhen here and the rest of them. Show them what you got." Aden said, quickly leaving the room.

The kids stayed in their positions, waiting to see what the kids upfront would do. There were three boys and two girls. Zhen looked the most confident out of all of them, he had bushy but straight eyebrows, and his hair was neat, sticking outward slightly to the side.

He had a pair of strong shoulders on him and always had his beast sword by his left side. As for the others, one of the boys who were with them was Erlen, who was no longer his former self. His eyes looked dead and didn’t even look like he cared that he was there.

"Alright everyone, you heard what the teacher said, but let’s be honest, what can we really teach you in such a short amount of time?" Zhen said, raising his shoulders. "Let’s face it, if you choose to fight, then you will only get a beating, and the last thing we want to do is be called bullies. So I have an idea. There will be three groups, the Earthborn group, the Graylash group, and yours, at this event. So what I’m going to ask of you guys instead is to just lose convincingly to us on the day. We won’t hurt you guys when there is no need to, and you can let this just be a competition between the Earthborn and the Graylash group.

"What do you say?" He asked.

When speaking, Zhen didn’t say these words in an arrogant tone. Instead, he was talking as if he was genuinely concerned for the students and was doing them a favour by coming top with this deal. Because of this, a lot of the students were starting to think it was a good idea.

They didn’t know the strength or skills of the other students taking the beast weapons class, but due to how much Aden complained about their skills, they thought it was a lost cause.

"Are you really that strong?" A voice from the students said. "You don’t even know if we are weaker than you. You just looked at us and assumed. Besides, isn’t this military training for fighting against the Dalki? Do you think we can really just say to them it’s okay, we will let you win? No, we can’t, we fight so we can get better." Shiro said.

The smile on Zhen’s face stayed present.

"I just wanted to help you guys." He said, "You don’t need to take us up on our offer. And about what you said earlier. Let’s see then, why don’t we have a duel if you really think we are on the same level. Maybe you are right, and I was just being too cautious."

As Zhen said these words, Erlen walked forward and grabbed Zhen by the sleeve.

"Don’t do it, leave that kid alone Zhen, trust me, it’s not worth it. You don’t know what will happen if you mess with these kids."

Pulling his arm away and out of Erlen’s grasp, he whispered in his ear. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

"You’ve changed Erlen. I know you were some big shot in the elemental class, and I don’t know why you decided to move into the beast weapon class, but me and you are not the same. I don’t rely on my family’s power." Zhen said, walking away and up to Shiro.

Erlen started to shake again, not because of what he thought Zhen would do, but because of what he feared Hardy might do.

"Hey, you two girls, you saw that I took no part in this right, make sure you remember this." Erlen said.
