Chapter 1237: The real end

Hilston might have been the strongest human, but his unprotected organ stood no chance against Sil's strength. In his last moment, he looked at Sil, a plethora of emotions in his eyes. What was strange though, was a grin had appeared as if he was expecting this moment to come at some point. Falling to the floor, the Blade leader lay dead in the sand.

Sil had never imagined that the person he had been so afraid of for most of his life, the one person who had made his life a living hell, forcing him to kill his own friends would die just like that. Sil had always believed that one day he might be able to grow strong enough to defeat him in a fight, but for some reason this kind of ending didn't feel right.

At the moment, he really didn't know how to feel at all. He had expected to feel great joy about finishing him off or maybe some sort of sadness. After all, for all the cruel things he had done for him, there had been rare moments of the person who had looked after them, made him call them

'grandpa' had gone, but instead he just felt empty.

'Is this what revenge is supposed to feel like? Should I have asked you a few questions after all or would it have just been worse, listening to you justify your selfish wish of growing stronger, no matter the cost?'

Seeing this, Slicer, who had been fighting Hilston up to this point, started to laugh out loud. She couldn't believe that a human of all things was the reason for this person's death. Perhaps some other Dalki would have been angry, but Slicer had already gotten her use out of Hilston.

The moment she had managed to slice off his arms, thereby managing to overwhelm the Demon tier Armour, the winner in this fight had been determined. Even if she would have continued to fight him, it would have been near impossible for Hilston to further aid her in her evolution anymore. As such, she didn't care if someone else claimed the kill.

Not having to fight him any longer also had its upside. Slicer was in an incredibly weak state, yet at the same time, this made her all the more dangerous.

Meanwhile, everyone watching at home couldn't believe this sudden interference in the fight.

"What the hell?! Why did he kill the old dude who was fighting the Dalki?! I always knew that they weren't on our side!"

"Someone, kill them! The Cursed faction are traitors to humanity! Why would they stop us from killing a five spike Dalki? If the two of them teamed up they could have weakened their forces!"

"The Cursed are always up to something strange. Up until now, I believed that the Cursed faction were the good V, but now I see it was all just for show. They must have been working with the Dalki all along!"

"Did you already forget what happened at the start of the broadcast? The Blade family has come in and attacked the Cursed faction ship, remember? They were trying to kill them!"

"So what? The Blade family were trying to kill the Cursed, not the human race! Even if they have differences, why not go for the Dalki first? Besides, for all we know, the Blade family were trying to get rid of the Cursed because they were working for the V!"

Swayed up in their emotions, everyone was filled with anger. They had never seen such a fight before and they were pissed off for it to come to such an unsatisfying ending. It was clear to them that this Dalki was far more dangerous than any other, but from what they had seen Hilston had proven to be far more powerful than any world leader, yet the actions of a single boy from the Cursed faction had not only allowed this dangerous creature to live, but had also robbed them of the one person with the best chance to defeat it.

Inside the strange science lab, Quinn had seen it all as well. He was surprised, but at the same time not.

'Sil, you finally got your revenge, but by the look on your face, I guess you were expecting for it to have more meaning.' Quinn thought. He too had experienced his fair share of getting bullied, fighting back those that had once beaten him.

It wasn't as extreme as what Sil or the other Blade children had gone through, but he had come to the realisation that despite at one point gaining the power to punish them, that it wasn't really what he was looking forward to anymore. If he had gotten revenge on his bullies at that point, he would have turned out no better than them, so instead he had concentrated to improve his own situation and that of those around him.

As a weakling Quinn had had dreams about having power, but once he got to the top it hadn't been what he had expected. Right now, Quinn wanted to be by his side, helping him through what was going on. In his mind right now, Quinn was running through the options of what exactly was the best course of action. What to do next.

Standing on the sand, Vicky looked out at Sil, her head felt like it was spinning, her stomach churning. During this trip, she had conflicted feelings with herself, with what to do. In fact, for the first time since what felt like forever she and her twin brother had gotten into a serious argument.

Before the attack, Pai had stopped her, and suggested that perhaps they should just pretend they were aiding Hilston. If they were to meet Sil, her brother wanted them both to let him escape. Of course, Vicky had disagreed with this, stating that Hilston would find out and he would make them pay dearly for crossing him.

What they didn't expect was to meet Vorden and Raten in the bodies of humanoid beasts. Neither had they expected their supposed mother and father to run away, leaving them as the only ones in the real Blade family to follow Hilston's bidding.

'Everything that we did‚Ä¶ everything that I did‚Ä¶ for what? I destroyed that Shelter, killed all those people, because I thought it would please Hilston. I thought it would get me on his good side‚Ä¶ Was it all for nothing?'

Images of the faces of the people who had begged her to let them live started to appear in her mind, followed by other horrible crimes she had committed. The girl felt like she was about to throw up.

That's when she felt Pai place his hand on her shoulder.

"You don't have to fake it anymore. You don't have to live a lie any longer. You know we're twins, right? I knew that everything you did was an act. Now we can finally be free, we can do whatever we want." Pai said, hugging his sister who began to cry. Tears were running down Vicky's cheek, but she wasn't really sure if she deserved to live after everything she had done.

Looking at Sil, she could see he was still standing out there on his own. Perhaps he was feeling something similar to how she felt now.

"Wait a second." Vicky mumbled, getting out of her brother's embrace herself as she realised something horrifying. "Fire, Lightning, Teleportation and Telekinesis make four abilities, so what was the fifth one?"

Vorden and Raten looked at each other, trying to think if they had seen Hilston use a fifth ability. The others didn't quite understand why it was a big deal. So what if he had access to one more ability?

However, the Blade twins knew that in such a fight to the death, it was impossible for Hilston to not use everything at his disposal. If he had refrained from using it, then it meant he had been unable to easy it earlier. While sorting through all the Chained' abilities that came with a condition attached, Vicky eventually arrived at the worst possible conclusion. Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

"SIL!" Vicky shouted at the top of her lungs. "HILSTON'S NOT DEAD YET! ONE OF THE CHAINED HAD THE ABILITY OF SECOND CHANCE! GET RID OF HIM NOW!!!!"

After destroying Hilston's heart, Sil had pulled his hand out of his body and had been in his own world, his gaze aimed at the ground. Without his heart, Sil had been convinced that it had been the end of their tormentor.

Just to be sure though, Sil's hands started to light up with lightning. Before coming here he had touched Grim, who had stayed behind, to obtain his ability. With no Demon tier armour, he was sure this would finish him.

Shocking the body on the ground, the lightning had hit nothing but sand, scorching it black. A few meters to the side, Hilston could be seen standing, his muscular body on show without a wound on it. Even his hands were attached to his body, albeit new ones, the old ones still lay on the battlefield inside a part of the Demon tier beast gear.

"I never thought that my own flesh and blood would dare to kill me! I had big plans for you Sil, big plans." Hilston repeated. "I told you that you will never beat me, even if your abilities are better than mine!"

Hilston fired out a lightning attack, yet Sil quickly countered with his own. However, when the two lightning bolts collided, the powers were equal. Despite Sil being able to access six abilities, their MC cells were just lower than the ones that Hilston had touched.

"I might not have the same strength as you or a body as good as yours, but it doesn't matter." Sil shouted, because it was at that moment, that blood was seen dripping from Hilston's neck and his head dropped down. Using his super speed Sil grabbed the head before it dropped to the ground.

"I don't know if you're still alive in there, but thank you for letting me kill you a second time. Maybe this will make me feel a little better." Sil said, as he smashed the head in the sand and stomped on it for good measure. The skull was smashed in seconds and the brain inside popped like a balloon.

This was the real end of Hilston Blade.
