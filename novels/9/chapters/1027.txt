Chapter 1028 - Quinn missing?

By now, Quinn knew to take Vincent’s silence as a yes and honestly, he didn’t think it was a bad idea. To ask Eno to teach him a few things. Eno was a vampire who had lived longer than any of the leaders, a vampire original. He was sure to know of all the tricks the vampires had come up with when using their blood powers.

The problem was, the type of person that Eno was.

’I’m sure even if he did want to teach me, because I asked him for a favour he would also want one in return, and based on what the favour is, it might just not be worth it.’ Quinn thought. Talking to him for a small amount of time was difficult enough, and he couldn’t imagine him as a teacher.

A short while later, the rest of the Cursed faction had finally entered Quinn’s room.

"What the...I thought our rooms were amazing but yours is as twice as big as ours and is even fancier. Is that a golden tap?!" Nate said excitedly, as he started to play with the tap expecting something else other than water to come out of it.

"Our rooms are nice as well, but it makes sense for Quinn to be treated this way, now that he is a world leader and all." Sam said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Quinn didn’t actually notice that his room was any different than the others. He had been used to the simple life so much that he was happy with just a bed, kitchen and bathroom, he didn’t really need anything else. It was a shame that he didn’t really have the time to appreciate the luxuries around him.

"This isn’t the room they usually give me, I think they just put me up in here for now." Quinn replied modestly.

"Yes, Oscar told me about that." Sam replied. "It looks like our plan worked somewhat, you made quite an impression on those kids and they have been asking non stop to see you. Not just because of who you are but what you did for them. Oscar couldn’t just let you stay in the normal teacher dormitories now everyone knows you’re a world leader."

After their little chat, it wasn’t long until they got down to business. Inside Quinn’s room there was even a dining table that was large enough to seat them all and that’s where they decided to sit for the time being. In Quinn’s room were Sam, Wevil, Linda, Nate, Dennis, Peter, and Fex. In other words, it was all the leaders of the Cursed faction that were on Earth at this moment and time.

Quinn started to first explain what happened with the Dalki attack and how he had met Eno beforehand. He didn’t see any need to talk about the system as that was his own business, but he would speak to Logan about it later on.

He then went on to talk about what was discussed with Eno when he had asked his three questions and also his request with Sil. The others already knew about Arthur and more, as they had to learn about the situation from Leo and the others when living in the vampire world. Now they had a better understanding of what was going on, and from what they knew about Brock, they were able to put the two things together.

"I see, well that might make things a little difficult with your request." Sam said, as he went on to explain what they had also learnt from Brock, that the Dalki were after the second half of the demon tier beast and it was on the Blade island.

"So you think that Eno is going to want to use Sil to copy Mona’s powers and help him move the demon tier beast?" Quinn asked.

"Honestly yes, otherwise Brock would have never told us about it. From what you have told me, maybe Eno’s condition would be to help you only after Sil has helped him." Sam said.

Quinn nodded as he understood, but Nate looked around the table and he wasn’t the only one confused. "Why?" Nate had to ask.

"Because of the way Sil’s ability was before." Sam answered. "When Raten and Vorden occupied his head, Sil was only able to use three abilities at one time. To control a demon tier beast is something that not even Mona can do. Once Sil copies the ability he also needs to find other high MC cell users to power up the ability. With three abilities it’s a gamble whether or not he can control the demon tier beast.

"However, with six abilities it’s probably easily done. If Eno brings back Vorden and Raten, Sil could lose his ability to copy six abilities and will be back to the three, same as before. I’m sure due to Brock having lived on the Blade island he knows about this as well and he will use this information and the fact that Quinn wishes to help him against him."

Now everyone had a better understanding of what was going on but there were still many questions on everyone’s mind.

"What happens if Bryce finds out about this?" Fex asked.

This was something that Quinn hadn’t really been concerned about. He was treating the vampire world and the current war with the humans and the Dalki as two different matters.

"I don’t know." Quinn replied. "The other half of the demon tier beast the Dalki are looking for is in the vampire world, I don’t even think Bryce and the others know about it, nor that the Dalki are looking for it, and it’s the same for Eno. The only one that I told about Eno still being awake was Arthur, and we know what he plans to do... At the moment, we can’t protect two places at once and for now nothing has happened in the vampire world.

"Although I don’t want to say this, if something does happen, we just have to trust that Bryce and the others will be strong enough to fight off whatever attack happens to them." Quinn replied.

Although, even Quinn was concerned with what Arthur would do, did he really wish to kill all the vampires including those from the tenth family. If so, maybe he would have to step in and get involved.

After the meeting was over, the rest decided to head back to their rooms for a good night’s sleep, including Quinn. The next day would be the event where everyone from all over was invited. When the morning sun rose, everyone was dressed in their most formal clothing.

They were already woken by the sh.i.p.s that were constantly flying all morning to the new school. Some of them were nervous, others were excited to be meeting people they saw on TV all the time.

When everyone was ready, they met up in the hallway and headed towards Quinn’s room. Upon entering however, they found a note that had been left behind.

[I will be a little late to the event. All of you head on without me, there’s something I need to do first.]

"If we turn up without him, I’m sure there will be a lot of people who will be asking us questions nonstop." Linda commented.

"Quinn will be there." Sam said. "Besides, I’m sure it’s something important to him."

Nearly all of the teachers and important figures were invited to the ceremony and the students’ training would be cut short. Today, after the special announcement was to be made, they would be sent off to join the factions of the different squads in the military. Their training would continue there as they prepared for the fight ahead of them.

Right now though, all the students were to stay in their classrooms where a substitute homeroom teacher would be looking after them. Here all the students could watch the event and announcement live on TV. An exclusive crew had been allowed to enter and they would go around talking to guests and interviewing them to broadcast to the entire planet.

All of the students were in their seats, patiently waiting and wondering what the event was, but they weren’t in the best of minds. It wasn’t too long ago they had just come back from a devastating event.

"Alright, kids the event should start in the next hour or so, you are allowed to eat snacks during the event, but talking has to be kept at a minimum so everyone can hear, okay?" The teacher said.

"Man, I can’t believe we didn’t even get to say thank you to Quinn." Swin said.

"I know, after everything he has done for us. I still don’t understand why a world leader would care about our class or kids like us." Venus replied.

"I think I have an idea." Shiro said. "Quinn said that he was like me. He had no ability and was weak. Remember all of his speeches? I don’t think that was an act, but you’re right, I wish I could at least say thank you."

Suddenly, the students started to talk loudly amongst each other as they pointed to the front.

"What’s he doing here, isn’t he meant to be at the event?"

"Before I go off to this god awful event, I just wanted to say one thing. It really was a joy for me to teach all of you. I wish I could have taught you for longer. I promise I will remember these days for the rest of my life and I hope you can remember me as well. I know not all of you will join the Cursed faction, but it would be great to see your faces again." Quinn said.

As quickly as he appeared, he had vanished and was off to the grand event.

"Quinn! Wait, you were the best teacher we had!" Swin shouted.

"Seriously, how can you leave without us saying thank you to you properly!" Venus said.

More of the students shouted as they truly were thankful for Quinn saving their lives that day. Without him they all knew the situation would have been devastating. They would never forget him for as long as they lived.

"Thank you, but this won’t be the last time I see you. I will return the favour when I join the Cursed faction." Shiro said.

"I look forward to it." Quinn whispered.
