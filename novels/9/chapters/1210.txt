Chapter 1211 Demon tier powers

[Demon tier Amulet: Branching Link]

[The Branching Link Amulet absorbs a part of energy from anything the User kills. Once the amulet has gathered enough energy it will unlock a slot. With each slot the amount of energy required to unlock a new one increases]

The information itself was split into different segments and this was merely the first one. Only after having killed a certain amount of Dalki did the energy requirement pass its threshold, unlocking the first slot, which was also the reason why neither Alex nor Quinn had received any sort of benefit from wearing it initially. The good news was that it sounded like it would work with anything that he killed, be it beasts, vampires, Dalki or other living things.

'As long as I keep killing Dalki, doesn't that mean I can technically have an unlimited amount?'

Quinn wondered. However, the system was vague, only claiming that it would require more and more energy for each additional slot, making him worry that at some point it could have the same issue as his exp bar.

[Once a slot has been unlocked the User is able to use it to mark any living creature.

Success chance will depend on the life-force and willpower of the living creature it is used on. ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

No matter the outcome, the slot will be used up.

Each successful Marking will also take up one slot.]

Given the description it appeared that Marking higher tier beasts, stronger people or the Dalki leader would most likely be hard to impossible. Quinn would have to choose between using the slots to attempt it, after all succeeding in marking someone like One Horn might very well change the tide of war, or use the slots on weaker Dalki, creating something like an elite guard.

[Those that are Marked can be either partially or fully controlled by the user.

Energy can be shared between User and Marked based on the User's discretion.

It's possible to strengthen a Marked via the User's energy.

It's possible to suck a Marked completely dry, thereby adding its strength temporarily to the User.

The only way for the Marking to disappear is upon the death of a Marked, death of the User or destruction of the Branching Ling Amulet]

This was the power of the Demon tier Amulet. Quinn wasn't too surprised that it turned out to have some brainwashing capabilities since the Demon tier tree had used its powers to enslave others. Still, there were differences to the original.

'I'm not able to control just anything. It seems like there is only a chance to control something and the amount of things I can control is vastly different. The energy as well given to the Marked comes from myself. I'm guessing they need to be alive to attempt to put a marking on them. Breaking a strong beast's will, or a human's will would be incredibly difficult to attempt at the moment.'

'Then there's the last catch. I thought it was strange that the Demon tier Amulet didn't give any stats, but that's because I can also take the energy from those that I have marked. I wonder if it's the same as Qi energy, or perhaps it will directly boost my stats depending on what I control. It's a temporary boost for me, but permanently affects the marked. Which means it's best if I don't use it on my own people.' Quinn concluded.

However, after reading everything, Quinn had come up with an idea just how he could use the amulet to help him take down the Dalki ships even quicker, but before that, he needed to run some tests.

Quinn wanted to check up on Alex, yet the Blood fairy had run off inside. But decided not to, since time was running out and could tell he was in no such danger due to the bond. After seeing to Wevil and Linda. He made sure that the two of them could look over him while Quinn had gone out on his own.

"Wait, Quinn what are you planning on doing?" Linda asked, before Quinn rushed off.

"The teleporters aren't working on this planet. So nobody can come to help or escape from this place. At the same time I need to get back to the Cursed faction planets and help them. There's a device on the motherships that jams the teleporters." Saying these things, Quinn was off out into the open field.

"Wait‚Ä¶is he planning on entering the mothership?" Linda realised.

"Not just enter." Ko said, who was standing by her side watching Quinn enter his shadow. "He intends to bring it down. I just got news that the Cursed faction managed to destroy one of those things!"

Although Quinn was able to destroy the mothership, it took far too much time. First, he had to find the Dalki camp on the planet so he could steal one of their ships, else he would just be shot down, before even coming close to his target. Even after he had successfully infiltrated them, he would have to face the crew of it and find the right rooms.

So he needed to find a quicker way. Soon he had come across another group of Dalki scouts amid the strange tailing trees and large colourful plants.

Wasting no time, Quinn began to take them all out fighting them. The amulet absorbed the energy as each of the Dalki was killed, until there was only one left. Soon, getting up behind the Dalki, Quinn attempted to use the power of the amulet on the Dalki.

He pressed it on its back and activated the energy. It started to light up for a few seconds, but the power soon disappeared.

[Marking has failed]

The Dalki swung its arm behind it, and now with Quinn's single slot gone, he had no use for the Dalki anymore. Using the blood drill was the quickest and easiest way to pierce through the Dalki's hard exterior and had the highest chance of killing it in one shot, and it hadn't failed him today, as he slammed it into the Dalki's chest.

'The move is so effective against Dalki's that Eno might have created it with the specific purpose in mind to counter them.' Quinn thought but he was realising the power of the amulet was harder to use then he first thought. 'If I want to mark something I have no clue the percentage or success rate. At the same time, I want it to be in good condition. It's not like the shadow eater where I don't have to worry how weak the person I use it is on.'

Nonetheless, Quinn didn't quit there and continued to look for the Dalki hunting squads. After fighting another squad it looked like his amulet filled quickly. Ten dalki was enough to fill up the first slot.

Meeting a third squad, Quinn defeated another ten, but a second slot wasn't filled. Capturing the last of the Dalki though, Quinn was able to make a second attempt at capturing one and once again it failed.

From then, Quinn met a smaller squad, one of five. Killing only a few of them had allowed him to regain the first slot. It looked like even if a slot had disappeared, the energy carried over so he didn't have to start from the beginning again. The good thing as well, was even if it failed the first slot energy requirements seemed to stay the same.

There was a worry that he would have to continue fighting more and more as the slots continued. Managing to have only one Dalki left, if it didn't work a third time, Quinn was going to have to try it on a lesser beast instead.

After all, he still wasn't sure what controlling a beast would actually work or feel like, nor did he have any reference as to how hard it was to mark a one spiked Dalki. Placing the amulet on the Dalki's back once more, when it lit up and Quinn moved his hand away. The exact same design that was shown on the amulet stayed on the giant lizard's back.

It was the same red as the Marked had, but his was only the size of the amulet itself, making it much harder for anyone else to notice.

[You have successfully marked someone]

[1/1]

'Yes! Now, let's see what you can do.'
