Chapter 984 - The Dalki growth

After getting the go ahead from Quinn that he was now allowed to travel to the vampire world, Logan wasted no time making preparations. In fact, he actually already had everything he needed with him packed away in a special robotic backpack. He would ’Carry’ this on his back with the support of his little spiders, making it pretty much weightless.

It was as if he always knew Quinn would say yes, but he was not to go on his travels alone. In a room placed away from the others, which needed a special pin to enter, was the new type of teleporter that would take one to the vampire world.

If someone was to stumble and open it, it would be quite troublesome for them, finding themselves in a strange place. Not that they could go through the teleporter anyway. This new teleporter was based on the vampire’s teleporters. On Logan’s side, a code needed to be input that would then activate the teleporter, and it was the same on Paul’s side.

Communication needed to be made before Logan could come across. However, this time, unlike when Quinn had gone, they did not inform the king or ask for persimmon. Quinn felt like he needed to last time due to entering the fourteenth castle, which was a big deal.

However, Logan was going to a place that he wasn’t even sure they were aware of or cared about. It also wasn’t like what he was planning to do, had anything to do with them in the first place.

Standing by his side were the two that would be coming with him for this short journey, Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Hopefully, you can make some more of that green serum for me," Borden said as he hopped onto the right side of Logan’s shoulder.

"I can try, but I wouldn’t count on it," Logan replied. Knowing that there was hardly any energy left in the large tubes.

As for the other one, she seemed a bit nervous to be coming along.

"I kind of understand why you brought Borden along with you, but why did you choose me and not one of the others?" Linda asked.

Logan looked Linda up and down as if it was a pain to explain to her, but letting out a sigh, he did so anyway.

"Have you and I ever talked before?" Logan asked.

"A few times on occasion, but I don’t; think we have ever had a full conversation," Linda replied, trying to figure out what his point was.

"And that is exactly the reason why I have brought you. Me and you haven’t talked before, so we have nothing to talk about. Which means I can get on my task with peace." Said Logan.

Linda didn’t know why, but she felt a little hurt by that comment, but Logan was just upfront and honest from what she had heard from the others. Speaking what he thought, sometimes it was better to have a person like this, rather than someone you didn’t know what they were thinking, like Kazz.

Thinking of the vampire world made Linda think of her. She still held a grudge against her for what she had done.

With the preparations done and the very small chitchat made, all three of them went through the teleporter, finding themselves at the tenth castle. Unlike last time, Paul wasn’t there to greet them, but Ashley stood in the throne room instead.

He was only there to make sure they had arrived safely and also to turn off the teleporter so it wouldn’t be linked to the Cursed ship while they were away.

There were no words spoken, and Logan just continued to walk past Ashley as if it was something he did every single day.

’Well, I can’t say the boy isn’t efficient.’ Linda thought as she was quite enjoying his style.

A few sprays of the special scent were placed onto Borden and Logan. Now they had no worry as they walked through the vampire settlement. Compared to before, the dark streets were full of market stalls, vampires talking and eating irregular meals at their restaurants.

It seemed like an old city in the human world, and Linda found it relatively peaceful.

"If we had seen this and experienced this when we first came, then maybe our opinion would have been a little different." She said.

What was most impressive was how quick they were able to recover as well. Soon though, leaving the settlement, they would walk through the forest, and from there, it was time to head to the mountain where the lab was found.

While walking through the forest, there was a single incident that occurred. It was when a snake-like beast came dangling from one of the trees. It swooped down on them.

Linda was ready to get in the way, but when the snake reached a certain distance. A claw-like machine came out from the top of Logan’s back and held it in place, then a blaster formed around Logan’s arm, and he fired it a few times, eventually killing the snake on the spot.

’Even though the kid isn’t like us, he seems to be quite powerful with all his little gadgets. I guess he isn’t just the inventor of the ship.’ Linda thought.

Although the two of them didn’t talk much, in fact, not at all during the walk, even Borden was just sleeping on top of Logan’s shoulder. She quite enjoyed learning more and more about Logan.

Finally, after entering a series of caves, they had reached the lab that Logan was looking for. He had been here a few times, and every time he visited it, it felt less foreign to him. Maybe it was because of the lab’s layout, where certain machinery was placed. All of it was suited to his liking.

’It looks like I have a similar taste to my parents.’ Logan thought and soon got to work.

Linda and Borden were placed in the central room. They waited there patiently. They explored the place at first together, apart from one room that Logan told them not to enter, but soon found that not knowing what anything was, it was quite boring after a while.

So they remained in the main terminal room while watching Logan get to work. The backpack that he had on him turned itself into a workbench. The technical robotic arms that had stopped the beast from earlier, four of them were being used as legs popping it up like a table. Then the bag opened itself up and was able to supply Logan with every single tool that he needed.

After seeing him going back and forth in and out of rooms, Logan eventually asked Borden for a favour. Using a small syringe, he had taken some of Borden’s blood.

"Do you need that again for me?" Borden asked.

On the table was a flask and a syringe red in colour, then using the small amount of blood he had gotten from Borden, he slowly dropped it into the red liquid. Soon, the green liquid started to take over, and made a dark green colour as they both mixed together.

Another larger normal-sized syringe was on the side, and Logan used that to bring up some of the liquid from the flask.

"No, this is for me," Logan replied. His right robotic arm disconnected and fell to the floor. He injected the syringe directly into where the stump of his arm was.

"Logan what are you doing!" Borden said, worried, now realising what he might have been doing all along.

Logan fell to the floor as if he was in pain. The plan was to create. Clone of his arm, like they did so with Vorden and Borden, but why didn’t Borden realise it sooner.

The clone that was made was a Dalki, not another human, which meant that Logan couldn’t make human parts with the things inside the room.

The pain counted, and sweat was running down Logan’s face, but soon the pain would end, and when he stood up, he could feel something heavy where his right side was.

"I won’t be useless anymore," Logan said.

Standing there, Logan’s arm had fully regrown, but it wasn’t what it once was. Hard scales ran all the way up it, and the fingertips were shaped like a claw. Logan had successfully created himself a Dalki arm.
