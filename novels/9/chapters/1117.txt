Chapter 1118 - The active power

A little while before Quinn and the others arrived at Blade Island, there was a certain question that had been on their minds. ’If the Demon tier beast was so important to the Dalki, then wouldn’t it be better to just kill it?’.

If they managed to kill the beast or at least one half of it, wouldn’t that stop the Dalki from prolonging their life? Wouldn’t it turn into a ’simple’ waiting game for the human race? All they would have to do would be to outlast the Dalki until they would die by reaching the end of their lifespans! ​​

However, according to Richard Eno, doing so was practically impossible. In the first place the Demon tier beast used to be a two headed dragon, which had the ability to split itself into two. This was what it had done when originally fighting against the vampires.

Naturally the vampires had done their utmost to kill it, but all attempts had ultimately ended in failure. It seemed that the only way to kill the beast was to either kill both halves at the same time, or it needed to die when it combined into a whole again.

Unfortunately, the beast would always split into two halves when it was on the verge of dying and then flee in opposite directions. Even after managing to kill either half, the other had somehow been able to sprout its second head.

In the end, they had just captured the one half, without killing it.

All of these thoughts were currently running through Quinn’s head as he saw the dragon turn towards the tablet. He was reminded that even if they were able to kill the beast then, there was no guarantee the other half of it in the Vampire World wouldn’t regain consciousness and become whole once again.

’Still, this beast is too dangerous, and I have to stop it somehow!’ Quinn thought, but the dragon was high up in the air.

"Quinn!" Fex called out. "Follow me."

As quick as he could, Fex threw his needles into the trees and also made sure pieces of string were left behind so they could be used as platforms. Quinn quickly followed until he reached the top of the tallest tree.

Layla was still riding on Quinn’s back, but even from this distance it didn’t look like she could reach the dragon with her arrows.

"Quinn, let me give you a boost!" Logan shouted, as he quickly followed after the two of them.

"Drop me!" Layla requested. "Fex will catch me!"

Everything was happening so fast but he needed to trust his teammates. Doing a small jump, Quinn was in the air for a few seconds before he landed on Logan’s Dalki hand. Then with all the strength Logan could muster, he threw Quinn as hard as he could, while Quinn also pushed off kicking from his feet.

Even with Logan’s strong Dalki hand, his whole body was flung backwards as a result.

"Damn you guys for making me do so much work!" Fex complained as he quickly used his string to grab his two falling friends. Layla hadn’t even looked behind, instead stretching out her hand toward Quinn.

’I know it won’t be much, but I’ll do what I can to help you reach that dragon as well.’ Layla thought, as she pushed herself to the point where all her MC cells ran out.

Quinn looked like a shooting star through the sky, but there was one giant problem. He couldn’t exactly change his direction mid-flight and the dragon was slowly turning its body away.

’It’s about to fly off, I have to do something!’ Quinn thought and extended his shadow to latch onto the dragon’s tail. By shrinking it afterward he was eventually able to reach the Dragon’s back.

’I have to figure out a way to slow it down somehow.’ Quinn thought. ’Or make it plummet down. Wait I second, can’t I do that?!’ He looked at his white gauntlet on his hand and pressed it down.

Back at the tablet, the process had been completed and Shiro was standing there looking at his hands in shock. "It’s... over already? Is it really done? I don’t feel a difference yet!"

"That isn’t too surprising, I practically added a part to you that you have yet to become familiar with. Normally, you would have an ability book to guide you, but since we have neither that nor someone who could teach it to you, I’m afraid you will have to undergo quite a bit of self discovery. It will depend on your talent as to how fast you will be able to help your little friend there. ’’ Eno explained.

Shiro looked at Sil and smiled. "Come on, let’s give it a go." He said excitedly, as he reached out towards Sil, but soon his hand was knocked away.

"No." Eno said. "Just like I held up my part of the deal, Sil needs to hold up his as well. He needs to move the dragon first. Your little actions could possibly make it so Sil goes back to the way he once was."

"Brother, look above!" Borden shouted as he pointed towards the sky, and that’s when they could see a dragon coming their way. However, it wasn’t flying straight towards them, instead it seemed to be flying... drunk?

It flew in circles upside down, and then left to right as it made its way towards them. It would have been hilarious to see if that monstrosity wasn’t coming closer with each passing second, despite its questionable style.

"Everyone move!" Brock shouted, and it didn’t take long for all of them to split. A few seconds later, the dragon smashed into the ground where they all had just stood, throwing up dust and dirt everywhere.

Fex, with the others, had already been in pursuit of the flying beast. Despite its giant size and ferociousness, they were all worried about Quinn. As for the person in question. When the dragon had crashed, Quinn had tried his best to hold on but the force of impact had thrown him quite a distance off.

’Damn, I think my plan worked out a little too well, and this energy I’m feeling inside me, it’s so wild and strong.’ Quinn looked at his hand.

While on the beast, Quinn had come up with one of two plans. Plan A had been to attack the dragon repeatedly, until it would eventually become poisoned through gauntlets’ passive. The problem with this was the hard skin the dragon seemed to have. He had been unsure he would have been able to succeed in time before the dragon had reached the tablet.

As such he had gone with Plan B, which had been to use his other gauntlet’s active skill, the energy drain. He didn’t think it would work so fast or well, but he also had nothing to lose by trying it.

At first, Quinn had felt his whole body return to peak condition. He hadn’t used much of his stamina so far, but what little he had, had been refilled. After that though, his body had entered into some type of overdrive as more energy was flowing into him, the energy of the beast itself.

At first Quinn didn’t think it was having much of an effect, but being powered up, he thought he could at least deal a large significant blow to it, but then something strange started to occur.

The dragon had started to spiral out of control, as if it was doing anything it could to get Quinn off its back. Most likely it was experiencing something it had never felt before, its power being s.u.c.k.e.d away, so it had wanted to get rid of the tick responsible.

In the end, the two of them had crashed together and Quinn got chucked off to the side. He was in the middle of making a recovery getting up, and when the others had arrived from the other direction, they could see the dragon, creeping towards Quinn with its large head moving towards him, fury clearly written on its maw.

Quinn backed up a few steps, and realised that the tablet was behind him and that’s when something strange happened, the dragon stopped in its tracks and stayed there. It blew out air through its nostrils which hit Quinn like a wave of great heat.

’What’s going on, why isn’t it moving closer? Why did it stop its attack?’ Quinn wondered. The good news was, it didn’t look like it was going after any of the others as well and was just continually staring at Quinn.

He took a few steps to the left and the dragon’s eyes followed after him, ignoring the others. He then took a few steps to the right and it did the same.

"Why, aren’t you attacking me?’’ Quinn asked, thinking the dragon could answer, but it couldn’t. For it was nothing but a beast. The others watching were wondering what to do as well. Was this the perfect opportunity to attack it all together or should they let it go?

’Is that why it doesn’t attack? Is it worried about destroying it?’ Quinn thought, as he walked up to it. He was scared to turn his back on the dragon at first, as he turned his head around a couple of times, but it looked like it wasn’t going to move anytime soon.

"Just what is going on, I need to find out." Quinn mumbled, as he pressed both hands against the tablet and then the whole tablet began to light up.
