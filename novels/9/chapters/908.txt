Chapter 909 - Another blood fairy

A blood fairy was an illegal subclass. If one was created, it was the leader’s responsibility to get rid of it on site. If that didn’t happen, then the vampires could only assume you were not only going against their wishes, but was plotting something against the vampire settlement.

These subclasses were explained to have a high potential to either be used against them or ruin the current lives the vampires had built up for themselves at the moment.

"Same as Alex, who’s Alex?" Silver asked, confused.

Of course, Nate and Leo knew what they were talking about, but Silver didn’t. Alex’s existence was unknown to her, and she wasn’t part of the tenth family. Even if she was Fex’s sister, if she found out, there was always the risk she would tell her father or someone else and get them in trouble.

In all honesty, not Even Leo really knew who Alex was that well either. Only that he was a special subclass vampire that had created his weapon. After seeing the way the vampire from earlier reacted, he was starting to understand why Quinn had asked him to keep it a secret.

"There are quite a few subclass vampires inside." Leo continued, ignoring Silver’s question. "If we take what we saw earlier, assuming they are taking prisoners inside, I don’t think the best of things is happening inside. A facility disguised behind a mountain, out in the middle of nowhere away from the vampire settlement?"

"It certainly feels like they are hiding something." Said Fex.

It was clear that quite a few of them wanted to know what was inside, but they would need to be careful if they were to investigate. Suppose it was true that the eighth family was involved. In that case, it means as soon as they saw them coming, they would be able to send a message to the others almost immediately. With the state they were in now if someone like the last person they had met was called, they probably wouldn’t survive.

So instead, they decided to rest for the night. Their bodies needed to recover what was taken from them. Yes, they would try to avoid being seen, but it would most likely mean another showdown if they were seen.

They took it in turns resting as they kept an eye on the dome. It was too large to see all the sides of the dome, so they just looked at where the other three vampires had entered from. Eventually, while it was Silver’s watch, she could see the two girls who had entered leaving but without the man.

’Heading back to the vampire settlement?’

Placing the large box on her back down, she decided to follow them from quite the distance. She inched closer and closer as a test, and eventually, she realised that the two of them weren’t at the level of a vampire knight. If they were, Leo would have sensed it, and they would have discovered her by now.

She followed them in their general direction for a while through the forest until eventually, she could see it. She recognised one of the mountains that could be seen from the castles if one was to lookout. The two girls were definitely heading back to the settlement.

She tried to inch closer to them. If they were vampires from the settlement, then they would have an emblem on their clothing stating what family they were from. Silver mainly was travelling up high through the trees, but having taken one step too close, the two girls turned around.

"Did you hear something?" They asked.

"There are beasts on this planet, so hearing something isn’t that uncommon." The other replied, and the two continued on the journey.

Coming out from behind one of the tree trunks, Silver realised that she couldn’t get any closer without a confrontation.

’If they were able to sense me from that far, then they would have had to at least be at the noble level. So the leader involved is willing to work with their inner castle vampires. This whole thing smells rotten.’

Returning quickly, Silver was worried that she had left her post when she was meant to make sure the others were okay while they were sleeping. Upon returning though, she noticed that Leo was already awake and was leaning up against a tree.

"Did you find out what you needed to?" He asked.

"Yeah, I did, I found our way back, but we need to check out that facility first. Those two girls seemed scared." Silver said as she looked towards the two boys who were fast asleep, as if there wasn’t a care in the world. "Thanks for looking after them. Feel free to go sleep; you couldn’t have gotten much."

"I didn’t sleep much before as a human, and it’s even worse now as a vampire. Besides, we have more lookouts compared to before." Leo pointed to the top of his head, directly at the circle ring.

It was actually the cat that had informed Leo that Silver had gone off somewhere.

After the two boys had woken up, they didn’t see anyone else enter or leave, so it was time for the two of them to enter.

Walking up, they noticed that security was very minimal, almost as if there was none at all.

’I guess if they are vampires from one of the thirteen families, they can’t just leave when they want like the Bloodsuckers.’ Silver thought.

Leo noticed something as well. He still found it strange that those that he could sense hadn’t moved. It was as if they were locked up. There was no door to enter the dome, just part of the wall had been almost cracked to look like a cave entrance.

Leo suggested it was safe for them to all walkthrough, and so they did. They entered the cave-like tunnel and could hear the sound of screaming and groaning echoing through the tunnel’s walls.

"Hey, should we really be walking towards those noises?" Fex asked.

Eventually, they had reached the end of the tunnel, but it wasn’t the end of the groaning. Leo could sense that in a large circle shape as large as the dome itself, different types of energy spread out around and leading upwards.

Ham was the first to be sent ahead. If they spotted him, most would think it was just a weak beast. After leaving the tunnel and looking around, he returned.

"I would say it’s pretty safe for you guys to go ahead, but be prepared for what you’re about to see." Said, Ham.

They trusted Ham, a little, but it wasn’t until Leo said he said it would be okay as well that the group continued to move forward. When they had exited from the tunnel, Leo and the others could finally understand what he was seeing.

This facility was one giant prison. The centre of the dome was flat ground that looked to be mostly destroyed, and it made the whole place look almost like an arena, but instead of an arena full of crowds, it was one full of prisoners.

Spread across the edge of the dome were prison cells, each with one person locked behind them.

"What do they want to do with all these people?" Fex asked.

"That’s what we are here to find out." Silver replied. As she started to walk around the edge past each of the prison cells. They saw nearly every type of human subclass possible. The groans and screams were coming from them, but as they tried to speak or reach out, their minds seemed wholly broken down.

They were unresponsive to the group’s calls or presence.

"A blood fairy!" Silver said in shock. "They have a blood fairy!"

Nate looked at it. Its appearance was similar to Alex, but it was a sad sight to see. It looked like its wings had been pinned down to the floor, only allowing one to move its body. And the blood fairy eyes looked dead.

"What family is behind all of this? Why are they keeping so many different subclasses here!" Silver said, speaking out loud.

Eventually, they had stumbled across a man that seemed saner, as he responded to them, running up to the bars and grabbing them.

"I’m sorry for whatever I’ve done, but please let me out!" He cried.

This one was a regular vampire and was the only regular vampire they had seen so far. Judging by the fact that he wasn’t as worn down like the others, they guessed that he was the one that had been brought in not too long ago.

"I’m sorry, but please, I don’t remember anything!" The man screamed.

These words from the man, meant far more than they realised.

"What do you mean, you can’t remember anything?" Fex asked while gulping.

The man touched his head. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

"My memories, who I am, where I am or what this place is, they are all gone!"
