Chapter 932: You can rest

The large black ball that left from Quinn's hands came out fast, and it was the skill shadow eater. A skill that worked best the weaker an opponent was and if it was successful he was hoping it would be enough to stop Cindy.

Seeing the giant ball of darkness, the other leaders moved out of the way, frightened for dear life as to what might happen if the skill touched them. They had seen what the skill had done to Vadeen, when Arthur had used it, and they didn't want to suffer the same fate.

Cindy was holding on to so much power, that she had two choices; to cancel the skill she was doing, dropping the power to attempt to avoid the shadow, or continue on with the skill. In the end, she chose to continue on with the skill and the head of the large black ball split open creating a mouth shape, consuming her.

They could no longer see Cindy as the large shadows covered her whole body, but the black ball made of shadows, started to sink into the ground and when it touched the floor, it spread out making its way to Quinn. FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

'Did it work?' Quinn wondered, as the shadow scurried across the ground, and when it finally attached itself to him, he was in for a surprise.

[Shadow Eater skill was successful]

[You have gained 1000 MC points]

[Total MC points 0/1260]

[You have unlocked the Enhancement soul weapon 'Shadow Overload']

Not only was the skill successful, but Quinn had gained the most MC points from using the skill he had ever done before. He didn't know what to expect since regular vampires only gave him a total of ten, but it seemed like a vampire, at the vampire lord level, was worth using this skill on.

Unfortunately, Quinn wasn't planning for more instances like this one to occur. While Quinn bathed in joy of the skill being successful and the amount of MC points gained, there was still an uncertainty if it had actually done anything.

He turned to Cindy, who almost looked frozen in place, her arms were unmoving. That's when Quinn noticed that all the blood that was frozen in the sky from the whole settlement, had dropped and fallen to the floor.

The skill had worked and it had done its job.

Soon after, Cindy fell to her knees and was sweating radically. A pool of water was forming from her feet and a searing pain was felt throughout her body.

"Noooo! She screamed at the top of her lungs so loud that it was comparable to a small Banshee's scream.

The pain was unbearable along with the weak tired feeling. She felt like a newborn vampire sitting in the sun for the first time. Even though there was darkness all around, and she would have to live with it for the rest of her life.

Knowing this, she knew there was one way out from this pain, from this torture of a lifetime. Lifting her hand up she was ready, ready to finish herself off. When she lifted her hand though, she felt it quickly being yanked and hammered down to the floor on both sides.

"We can not let you off that easily." Muka said, pinning her arms to the floor. "You will not get off that lightly by just running away and not giving us an explanation."

She attempted to move her other arm, but it was being held by Sunny. No matter how much strength she tried to gather to pull herself away from them, she wasn't able to.

Quinn, seeing this, started to think that the skill Shadow Eater seemed to be harsher on those who were more complete on the vampire evolution scale. He remembered when he was a halfling he was affected by light, but the downside was worse with each evolution. Thankfully the rings saved him from that suffering, but even with a ring now, Cindy would feel no different.

Perhaps, being a vampire lord, the effects of the sun were even worse, and she might have been even weaker than a human right now. A horrible thought for a vampire leader.

At that moment, a leader who hardly had any damage at all came out, and threw her needles out on Cindy who was lying flat on the floor.

"Suzan?" Muscat said, surprised. "Where have you been?"

The questions asked almost seemed embarrassing for Suzan to answer, as her cheeks reddened. Especially since everyone was badly hurt and had fought a tough battle, while her clothes were all seemingly fine.

"I know how strong the second family's ability is, so I thought my ability would be important in this fight. So I decided to protect myself at all costs and only come out at the right time." Suzan replied.

"So you came out when we had already done the job?" Muscat replied, who was clearly annoyed. As a new leader he usually wouldn't have been so outspoken, but he was just expressing how the others were feeling.

However, they needed to ignore that for now, as there was a lot of work that was to be done. The vampire settlement had just suffered an attack. An original had been woken, and Cindy still had the blood armour on her body, and the blood power in her control. These things would need to be removed from her.

Thanks to Quinn's skill though, they shouldn't be too much trouble.

"Just kill me‚Ä¶" Cindy muttered out quietly.

A shadow was then cast over her, and when she looked up, it was an old man with a white beard, Bryce. He had healed from his wounds and now that Cindy had been defeated, Kazz was able to feed him some blood.

Still, the wounds from the fight seemed to still appear on his body, and even the blood wasn't able to completely heal him but it allowed him to move.

"This is another day that shall be remembered in vampire history." Bryce said, looking at her. "Although it is tough for the vampires. After going through an event like this, it will only bring us who have worked together, closer."

Hearing these words, Cindy couldn't help but smile, and she attempted to spit out a piece of blood that was felt in her mouth but being so weak, it had failed to go far and just dribbled down her chin.

"Screw you, and your vampire settlement." Cindy said. "What did you do exactly? Did the leaders save this place? Did you, as their King, save this place? No! The only reason why all of you aren't dead right now, is because of that damned outsider. Don't think I don't know how much you wish to get rid of him Bryce‚Ä¶and now he saved you all. This is truly pathetic, you are a pathetic King."

Bryce looked behind him, at Quinn who was huffing and panting. He looked exhausted and beat. What Bryce also noticed was there were hardly any wounds on him at all.

"Looks like I did a better job than you." Bryce said, looking back at Cindy. "We will pry into your brain, and find out everything you hid and how you tricked the whole settlement. Don't worry, your time is not over here."

Walking away, he let the other leaders deal with Cindy, besides Bryce had his own recovery to do, and there was a lot to be done after getting what they needed from Cindy. Walking past for the first time ever, Bryce placed his hand on Quinn's shoulder.

"You did a good job." Bryce said.

Quinn shrugged Bryce's hand off his shoulder. He still hadn't forgiven him for everything he had tried to do before.

"Me and you are not friends Bryce." Quinn said. "I didn't do this for you because you're my King. Let me get this clear on our positions. You are not my King, this whole mess I shouldn't have been involved with in the first place. I'm telling you now, I'm leaving this place and I'm taking them with me."

Saying these words, Quinn looked Bryce in the eye, and he looked back at Quinn as well. The others watching from the execution stage were nervous. Thinking that there might be one more last fight after all.

"You can rest now." Bryce said walking away, and a few seconds later, Quinn felt his knees wobbling, and his body tumbling to the floor, as he fell lying there flat on the cold ground.
