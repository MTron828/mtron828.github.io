Chapter 1126 - Plan coming together

In the first major attack of this second war, Quinn had successfully defeated the invading Dalki with minimal losses on the human side. A four spiked Dalki had invaded earth, yet had been unable to progress further from the original spot of where it had landed. Another four spiked Dalki had been beaten so badly that they had been forced to run off, while the rest of its forces had been dealt with, and of course the Cursed faction leader had saved the second fleet of the Graylash family.

All of these battles could be considered victories of the human race, despite the losses they had suffered on their side. So what did a loss mean?

Due to how important this was, and wanting to know more details, Quinn quickly gathered everyone on the island. They moved into the main castle throne room and sat around a dining table that was already placed there.

Next, Logan placed a device in the centre of the room, and a holographic display of Sam appeared in the middle. With it everyone would be able to hear the message and receive the details of what had occurred without the need to repeat it over and over.

"There’s quite a bit to explain and soon this information will be revealed to the public. Quinn, you and Owen were asked to be the first people to be contacted and this information to be passed on, so I want you to think carefully about what you want to do next." Sam said.

Everyone in the room was seriously listening in, including Eno and Brock.

"It all started when some Dalki were discovered on one of the beast planets owned by earth. It is centred quite fairly in the middle and not too far away from Earth’s Portal Station. Because of this, Oscar decided to treat it as a serious matter and sent out his men to deal with it."

"Quinn, Fex, Layla and Sil, you should already be familiar with this planet. It’s the Orange portal planet you all had gone to on an expedition."

Immediately, both Quinn and Fex looked at each other. For it wasn’t just the planet that their school had gone on an expedition for, but it was also the planet where they had awakened Arthur from his sleep.

’The Dalki were found there? And the Dalki are there as well. Does this mean... could Arthur really be working with the other side? Just what could they be doing there?’ Quinn wondered.

"Why didn’t the Earthborn group ask for the Graylash faction or the Cursed action for help?" Chucky couldn’t help but ask.

"It’s a good point to make, but it was because they didn’t think they needed to. Their scouts estimated for there to be only one or two dozen Dalki, a number that two fleets should have been able to beat. There were also rumours of humans living at the settlement in peace, which made the Earthborn group assume they had to be Vs. They sent out two head generals to deal with the situation, Samantha and Sach."

"In the end, the Dalki known as One Horn showed up there as well. Oscar had already predicted something like this might have happened, so he had stayed in the vicinity. The next thing they knew the humans were retreating from the settlement, Sach is in the hospital and Samantha has come out relatively fine. As for Oscar... It seems like he is on his last legs."

"By the time we received a request for help, he was already facing One Horn to allow everyone else to escape. He barely managed to escape, but his arms, legs, and limbs were ripped from his body, His heart has remained intact, and same with his brain, but he is unresponsive at the moment."

"They are keeping him alive, but are unable to perform surgery on him, for fear it might end his life. Now Innu is all that’s left really for the Earthborn group. Samantha can’t focus her attention due to her father’s situation and refuses to leave his side."

"Sach will live but might never be able to fight again, so Innu is panicking and has called for help from the Graylash and the Cursed faction otherwise things might seriously fall apart. I concur with his opinion that this base has to be important to them. The plan is to launch a coordinated attack with you and Owen. And for Owen’s response he is waiting for your reply first."

’Didn’t Erin and Paul tell us about the people in that Planet, they are not vampires. They were the people that Arthur was with at the time. So why are the Dalki there as well, and why haven’t they killed them?’

’Maybe if we go to the place, I’ll find out why Arthur did what he did.’

"Decline the request to attack the Dalki!" Was the first words out of Eno’s mouth after hearing what had happened. "Quinn, perhaps you’re curious why they are on that planet, but it is not worth the risk if One Horn is there."

"One Horn, even if he isn’t the strongest Dalki in existence, he is at least the primary reason why the humans, or even vampires for this matter, have little hope of winning this war. Think of what happened to Oscar! He had a Demon tier weapon with him, and two head generals by his side and still ended up in that state."

"I agree." Mona said, who had mostly been recovering in the castle after suffering from trying to take over the demon tier beast. "All of the leaders in the past fought against One Horn, and we still weren’t able to kill him. However, he must have gotten stronger to be able to do something like that.’

Although two people were warning him, Quinn felt like they were overreacting. Whenever he had been fighting he had gotten through tough situations and the only opponents that were able to completely overpower him had been Hilston and Arthur.

Were they claiming that One Horn was on their level?

Still more so than anything, Quinn wanted to go there, hoping he might discover something about Arthur. Maybe the people he had protected would know something.

"Perhaps this isn’t my place to speak." Layla chimed in. "But I think that Innu is obsessed with revenge at the moment and since he can’t do it himself, he wants to use us to achieve his goal. I think the more important thing is what to do with Oscar. Since he’s still barely alive shouldn’t we help him?"

’Did Layla really just suggest that?’ Quinn was baffled.

If a person was on the verge of death, what could they do? The only thing they could do was...to turn that said person into a vampire.

"She’s right, this could be the chance to have someone of great influence under your control, but what would the people think, if all of their leaders were suddenly something...different to them." Eno commented with a smirk.

"Can’t I help somehow?" Shiro asked, raising his hand. "If I can move Raten and Vorden into a body, doesn’t that mean I can do the same thing to Oscar?"

"We haven’t tried your ability on humans yet though. We don’t know what you can do, especially on someone who is unconscious or brain dead. Maybe Oscar is still alive, but his head is gone" Fex replied. "We don’t know until we test the situation ourselves, but using a World Leader seems like a bad place to start. The easiest way might indeed be to convince humans that vampires are good if we turn him in."

Now the humans in the group were starting to catch on, what exactly Layla was getting at.

"He should have a choice in that matter." Logan interjected. "It’s unfair to turn someone against their will. I’m sure many people would jump at this opportunity if it was to become a vampire or death, but I for one don’t think it’s right to just turn someone because it’s more convenient to us."

"Also it’s not clear yet if he can’t be saved another way. Technology has advanced very well. Even without limbs, if he wakes up he will be able to do everything he could before."

In the middle of their conversation, the device in the centre of the table started to vibrate once again, noting that there was an incoming call. When answering they could see Sam again.

"I know I haven’t given you enough time to decide what to do, but that is not why I called. Quinn the request that you have asked, we have finally been able to find one. A humanoid Demi-god tier beast."

’Finally.’ Quinn thought, as he looked towards Shiro.
