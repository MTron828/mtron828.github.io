Chapter 1173 Too muChapter Qi Part 1

Layla felt a shooting pain from the back of her head after her whole body had crashed through the wall. When the girl opened her eyes, she could see the person who was standing in the centre, and for a brief moment, her mind went blank.

All the negative emotions and memories in regards to her mother were replaced for ones with the person in the middle of the area. Her first encounter with Quinn as part of the same testing group for military school, the time he had sucked her blood in the library, the time that the two of them had hugged after finding out Cia was a part of Pure.

The time when Quinn had tried to cheer her up after Cia‚Äôs death, and of course when she had openly expressed her feelings towards him. It was a welcome distraction from the horrible situation of her own past as a member of Pure.

The memories of what she had done as a True Hannya were quickly coming back to her, yet the purple glow started to dim from her eyes and her physical form returned to her regular human self. Layla looked down on herself to check for any injuries. Her own barrier Qi had shattered from Quinn‚Äôs attack, even before she had hit the wall, yet she still felt fine, making her wonder how exactly he had achieved such a feat.

---------

At the same time, Raten smashed his way out of the wall, chunks of dirt falling to the ground. When nearly all of it had fallen off the Demi-god tier beast‚Äôs true form was visible underneath the dirt, and it was much more human than the others would have thought.

Its original body was a dark brown in colour, with parts of its flesh having parts of earth sticking out from it. The earth still remaining on the beast was more a white colour, compared to the mud it was covered in. With a closer look it appears the parts were stone. When looking at the head of the beast, this too was all a white stone in colour. They were clumped together giving the beast an appearance that it had white spikes for hair.

‚ÄôDamn that kid! How long have I been out of it, for him to have grown this strong? This new body is stronger than anything I have ever felt, so how did he just take away my powers?‚Äô Raten wondered, displeasure on his face. He had ended up close to where Fex and the others were.

Sil was the first to approach his beast-like form, and just smiled at him like a kid seeing the dog his parents had bought him for Christmas. The Earthborn soldiers didn‚Äôt understand what was going on and were ready for another battle to break out at any moment between the beast and the monstrous body from the Blade Family, but instead they saw Sil bawling.

"I‚Äôm sorry! I‚Äôm so sorry! Because of me, everything that happened to you for so long... it‚Äôs all my fault." Sil apologised in between sobs, his face covered in tears that just wouldn‚Äôt stop falling.

"Damn it, shut up!" Raten berated him, as he raised his hand intending to flick the other‚Äôs forehead, but then, seemingly recalling the power of this body, he slowly put it down again. "This might not be a human body, but this whole beast thing is pretty cool. I‚Äôm just glad I don‚Äôt have to share with you or that loser anymore, so don‚Äôt worry about it!"

There was still confusion amongst the Earthborn group, but there was one clear difference now, it was the fact that although the beast could communicate with them before, it was doing so perfectly. Raten still had slight trouble with certain words, since his throat wasn‚Äôt really designed to produce those sounds, making it seem as if he had an accent.

With Sil‚Äôs current state, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to fight anytime soon. Raten looked ahead and thought that there was no longer a need for him to get involved. Since Quinn had been able to deal with three of them at once, he had everything under control.

---------

A few seconds later Layla had also returned to the group, her gaze pointed downward, trying to find the right words to apologise for what had happened. Her body wasn‚Äôt as sore as when she had fought against Agent 11 earlier, however Layla‚Äôs energy was at an all-time low. Her vampire powers were somewhat still active, but she had trouble feeling any Qi whatsoever.

"I liked your other look more." Raten commented sheepishly. It was somewhat awkward for all of them all to have a Demi-god tier beast so close to them and to listen to it make quips as if it was part of the group, but it was just something they had to get used to.

Layla ignored Raten‚Äôs remark and made her way to Longblade. His eyes were still open, the Colonel had even the power left to lift his head and he had eagerly spectated the wild battle.

"You did a...great job." The military man praised her with a hint of a smile on his face.

Layla blushed at this sudden compliment, but focused on treating Longblade‚Äôs wounds. Fex had done some work on him by wrapping up certain parts with his string to stop the blood flow and had also applied pressure to the wound, but it wouldn‚Äôt be enough. They didn‚Äôt know how much longer they would be staying in the cave before they could receive help from above.

‚ÄôI‚Äôll need to transform into my third form, and then I can use the green fire to heal it." Layla thought, but when she was about to recall some of her bad memories, her mind blanked out. This was the first time something like this had happened, yet her hand was shaking as if she was scared by something.

It took her a moment to realise why she might have subconsciously stopped herself from transforming. ‚ÄôWill I change into the fourth form again if it becomes too much?‚Äô Layla wondered, biting on her bottom lip.

The girl took some deep breaths and decided to trust in herself and that even if something were to happen, with Quinn present, he would be able to stop her. Instead of using her own thoughts Layla chose to consume the negative emotions of those around her.

For one there was Longblade who, despite his stoic outer appearance, was afraid that he might not be able to make it out alive. She also took in the feelings of fear towards Raten that the Earthborn group had to varying degrees.

With all of that combined Layla felt that she had enough energy to change into her third form. Some gave her some cautious looks as they watched her transform, especially when she summoned the green fire, however it softened as soon as they saw the effect on Longblade‚Äôs wounds. It didn‚Äôt look to be more powerful than the healing abilities most had seen, but it was enough to ensure the Corporal would make it out alive as long as there were no other complications.

During this fight, she could tell that everything inside her was spent. That would be the last time she could transform, all her energy was spent, but it was okay because he was there. Now there was only one thing that was left for them all to do, as they stared towards the centre.

---------

Quinn had yet to make a single step from where he stood, only going down on one knee. What the others didn‚Äôt realise was that he was actually in incredible pain.

‚ÄôI made sure to kick Agent 2 away and the others haven‚Äôt attacked me either, so why does it feel like my whole body is suffering from Qi? Is there some type of problem?‚Äô Quinn tried to make sense of his body‚Äôs condition, as he concentrated and took a look inside.

It didn‚Äôt take long for him to figure out just what was happening and it was certainly a strange thing to say the least. It had taken Quinn some time to absorb some of the crystals that he had found, but with each one he had felt the ball of Qi inside his body expand ever so slightly. He was growing with strength making him not quite the same as he was before.
