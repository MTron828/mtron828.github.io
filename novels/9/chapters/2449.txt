Chapter 2450 Minny vs Galen (Part 2)

Neither person had hit each other yet in the battle, as it seemed like a contest of blood swipes and just avoiding each other, but everyone in the crowd was still amazed. The control of blood, the power of the blood aura being used, it was all amazing.

Some were wondering when the other would tire, or more importantly make mistakes. It was almost as if the other was waiting for them to make the first move as they put on this display.

While everyone was focused on the fight, Xox had positioned himself so he had switched positions with one of the other community leaders, and now he was next to Andy and Jessica.

"These two truly are amazing, I wonder if Quinn trained them personally himself." Xox said. "With these two, even with him gone, I guess there is no need to worry about the settlement's safety. I wonder if they had a hand in dealing with the Immortui problem you talked about earlier."

Andy was biting his tongue a bit, wishing he had said nothing, so he just nodded as he listened to Xox.

"You know, what you said before about him. I've been hearing his name pop up within the vampires of the Graylash planets quite a bit."? Xox lied.

"Really?" Jessica reacted, and so did Andy at this point.

"Have you noticed anything strange with them, or markings on their bodies? If so, it might be best if you talk to Muka after this event." Jessica claimed.

Being a celestial himself, Xox knew what markings were, and things were falling into place. Trouble in the settlement, the speak of Immortui and the markings, he could imagine the problems they had been faced with.

"I am happy to, in fact I was hoping I would see Quinn himself to tell him in person. As you said though, he is busy dealing with the situation. It makes me wonder where he's gone. Perhaps to find more people with the markings, or to try to track down this Immortui figure himself."

The silence from the two, pretty much confirmed it to Xox. Quinn either was attempting to go to the red space to track down immortui, or was involved with him in some other way.

Although he didn't know where he was, giving this information alone was enough to give the Ancient Ones the reason they needed to act.

The fight in the centre was heating up. Minny had stopped her flurry of swipes and instead now was focusing on the speed of her body. She exploded with power from her position, heading straight at Galen and swung leaving a large red claw in the air.

Galen had avoided it, and threw out two blood swipes, but rather than going straight towards Minny, it had gone around the sides. Seeing this, Minny went in for another strike, and Galen gathered blood aura in the palm of his hands.

It blasted out, hitting Minny as she made an X to defend herself. It wasn't a direct hit and she was strong enough to power through, but that's when the two blood swipes that had been thrown early came from the sides and hit her straight in the shoulders.

They exploded on impact, the attack wasn't a strong one, she just felt a slight sting in both of her arms, but she was the first one to have taken a direct hit in this fight.

"How, how!" Tobi said, grinding his teeth. "How can a kid so young have such good blood control? I struggle to throw the thing straight, and he can make it twirl and even time it while he's fighting.

"Come on Minny, break his legs!" Tobi screamed.

"You do know that's her brother she's fighting, and you're asking her to break his legs?" Abby sighed.

Minny getting hit had a big smile on her face.

"I see‚Ä¶ so you want to win that badly huh, then let me show you."

Minny charged forward again, and as the blood swipe came at her, she didn't try to break through or claw at it, she allowed it just to hit her body. She swung her arm again, and when it missed Galen as it had been doing.

Instead though, the claw continued hitting the hard metal floor, cracking it and breaking it to pieces. It flung up, and Minny kicked a large chunk of it, right at Galen.

Galen had knocked the large plank of metal away, but right behind it was Minny who threw out her arm, hitting Galen. The force sent him flying back and bouncing on the ground a few times, but he quickly got up to his feet looking unhurt, and just like Minny, he too now had a smile on his face.

"I don't know how much more of this I can watch." Layla said. Everytime one of them was hit or close to getting hurt, her instincts kicked in. She had even nearly jumped over the barrier a few times.

The good thing was, Minny had yet to use her celestial form, proving that they hadn't taken this battle too far.

Galen and Minny took a moment, the two didn't go back to attacking each other like they had before. It was almost as if both of them were evaluating their mistakes, to make sure that they didn't fall for the same trick next time.

"See, I told you." Minny stated. "I could teach you a few things. That's why I'm the big sister."

Galen didn't say anything, he was having fun and he was enjoying this moment, that was until he felt something strange. The smile disappeared from Galen's face, and he was no longer in a crouched position, instead he stood up straight.

"Huh‚Ä¶ is everything okay, little brother?" Minny asked, genuinely concerned.

The crowd had quieted down as well, wondering what had happened. They too didn't want these two young contestants to be harmed because of all of this, It was just for entertainment.

Galen, soon turned around, no longer facing Minny, he couldn't feel it before, but he could feel it now, the energy that was lingering in the air. He then was staring dead straight at a particular individual.

"Oh, why is Galen looking at us?" Jessica said.

"Is he, he's looking this way, but I don't think he's looking at us?" Andy replied, as he moved his body slightly to the left and right, but Galen's eyes didn't move. That's when they soon noticed that Galen was staring straight at the person next to him.

"Sin‚Ä¶ I think he might be staring at you." Valnar commented.

A sweat was starting to break out all over the vampire, at least the fake vampire, because Xox was getting a familiar sense of deja vu here.

'Don't tell me‚Ä¶ can he recognise me, can he feel the celestial energy now that he's closer to me?'

Galen lifted his finger, and pointed right at Xox. G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm
