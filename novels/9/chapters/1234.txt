Chapter 1235 Your own kind

The Cursed group were standing on top of a large sand dune. In the distance, they were able to see the fighting that was still ongoing at this very moment. The participants didn't seem to notice their presence, either because the group was too far away, or because they were forced to fully concentrate on their opponent.

The fight was heating up with every passing second, and large explosions of power were being released one after another. The Cursed group was still within a distance that allowed them to smell the blood coming off Hilston and the Dalki, at least those that were vampires.

They had been standing there for a while now and had witnessed Hilston get the upper hand over Slicer due to his Demon tier armour's active skill.

"That skill is so strong, I wonder what it would do to my strings?" Fex wondered.

"I could just walk through it, it's the hard armor that I'm impressed with." Peter replied.

Hearing this, Pai couldn't help but laugh at the two of them.

"That skill is extremely powerful. Not only would your strings fall to the floor or disintegrate but the second that pulse went through your bodies you would be unable to feel anything. It's impossible to fight it, and at the same time, as you can see, not even that Dalki can cut through the armour."

"Shut up you big brain, you're in the same situation as us." Raten complained. "You know, if he turns to us, I'm telling them you joined our side, so get ready to fight for your life, and use that knowledge to beat him." N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

Pai quickly went silent, and their eyes were back on the fight.

However, they noticed that Hilston's advantage had suddenly disappeared, and for a while now, he had gone on the defensive, both sides seemed to be struggling greatly.

Slicer, using two seperated tails as whips, was swinging them at a speed just as great as she would use her own tail, but thanks to Hilston's teleportation, he could quickly escape, and try his best to attack using his abilities.

Getting in close, he would use the telekinesis to slow down the attack. He did so after a swing from one of Slicer's tails and threw out a fist of his own. However, using the enormous tail she had regrown, Slicer wrapped around Hilston and was gripping on to him tightly.

Trying to get out of the situation, Hilston's whole body was lighting up in flames, until eventually Slicer had no choice but to let go. Even through her skin, the fire seemed to be getting stronger and would eventually even affect her unlike the lightning attacks. Nevertheless, she didn't give up and threw one of her tails like a spear straight towards Hilston.

Lifting up his hands, he stopped it mid-flight, but was too slow to see the large tail, sweeping below and going in for the attack again and again. The good news was, it was just hitting his armour and unable to damage him.

"This fight is crazy. They seem to have already surpassed most Vampire family leaders." Fex commented with his mouth left wide open. It was now moving at an unprecedented pace and all of those watching imagined themselves on the receiving end of any of these attacks. All of them estimated that they might get defeated in a matter of seconds. The power of the big four were in Hilston's hands, and they were even boosted and stronger, yet he was still unable to take out the Dalki.

This wasn't the only thing, even Hilston's physical strength could match the vampire leaders. Peter knew this for a fact, because he had felt the power behind just one of Hilston's hits. If one was to watch the sand around them carefully they could tell, because with each punch, the sand was being dragged and lifted, thrown all over the place.

"You told me to come over to your side, but can you see now why I can't?" Vicky questioned as she clenched her fist. Everyone could hear what she was saying but none got involved because this was a matter for the members of the Blade family.

"He is the strongest in the world! That Dalki is covered in blood and might be putting up a good fight, but she still can't even scratch him! Do you really think you can do anything against such a monster, Sil?" Vicky continued to speak, expecting an answer.

Although both members of the family, neither Vorden nor Raten considered this to be a place for them to say anything. Instead, they looked at Sil who had both his hands clenched and was looking at the fight, waiting for the right time to make a move.

'I wonder what you are thinking, Sil. It's always been hard to understand you.' Vorden thought.

Despite the fact that Hilston could no longer use his active skill Disruptive pulse, he was fighting better than he had done before with the use of the abilities. There were a lot of people that were worried about him once they had seen Slicer separate her tails to grow the current enormous one.

By using the ones she had discarded as weapons, it was now as if Hilston was fighting against three different Slicers. However, just like Slicer had been growing proportionate to the damage she had received, something similar was happening to Hilston, who was fighting with his life on the line.

Rather than using the abilities raw powers to finish off his opponents, he had to try to come up with combinations. He was forced to use his head to a degree. He could even feel the cells in his body growing more active. His survival instincts were kicking in and rather than his body choosing to run away, it was using this fight to allow the strongest human to grow even stronger.

Unknown to him, these cells activating through his whole body were Qi. Qi, beyond anyone's imagination, was running through him making him superhuman. This was why he could match up to Slicer for so long.

'The Blade family will always keep growing, and even now we will get stronger and stronger!' Hilston thought. 'Soon the armour will be charged again, and once the Disruptive pulse is ready, I will finish this oversized lizard off!'

At that moment, meeting up with the others on the sand dune were Bonny and Void. Void had his camera out and straight away zoomed in on the action that was going on in front of them. He didn't greet the others, or explain anything, he would let Bonny do the talking.

"What are the two of you doing here? Didn't I tell you to stay in the Shelter?" Sam questioned, shocked and also a little angry, they decided to ignore his orders. The two of them looked safe having no injuries on their body, but if there was even a single Dalki they had missed, the two of them could have easily died.

"We've lost two of our drones. It's getting more intense and even with Void's control they were hit. There is a good chance that all of the cameras will be lost if it continues. Practically everyone is watching this fight and we can't just sit around and not deliver its conclusion!" Bonny explained, making it apparent that they would stay here, their pride as reporters demanding it.

Sam sighed and agreed to their request, but refused to comment on anything while the fight was going on, to the camera that was. He soon saw one of the drones returning, now there was one drone filming the fight, and Void's personal camera, while the drone that returned was looking at the Cursed members.

Inside the lab where Graham and Quinn were present they could see the camera view switch. For a second the camera had panned over to all those in the Cursed faction that were watching the fight. Bonny wanted to get the live reactions of them all. This allowed Quinn to see his own body.

'Vincent, I told you to protect them, what are you doing bringing them to such a place?' Quinn thought, wanting to slap his forehead.

The Dalki looked to be heavily injured and covered in blood. Seeing this Quinn smiled thinking that even a five spike could be injured. However his smile quickly disappeared as he remembered that the Cursed faction were in a huge mess due to Hilston in the first place, and if Hilston was to win, he would soon be after them straight after.

"Was that a smile, are you smiling because you think your own race is going to lose?" Graham asked.
