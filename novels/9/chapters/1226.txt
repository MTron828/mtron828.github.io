Chapter 1227 Prisoners or V

The Earthborn group had attempted to find out what was happening on this particular planet before. They had discovered a group of Dalki not too far away from a group of humans. This was something unprecedented, so they had come to the conclusion that the only reasonable explanation had to be that these 'humans' had to actually have been V.

Alas, the first mission had turned out to be a disaster, mainly due to the presence of One Horn on that planet, who had bested Oscar, Sach and Samantha in a battle of strength. As if the subsequent loss of the Supreme Commander hadn't been enough, the military had also lost their only Demon tier weapon.

'I was in charge of the reports back then and learned from Sach everything that happened.' Nathan thought as he and his group were still deep in the jungle-like territory away from the Shelter. The map displayed different routes and the area they were currently in.

Because the military had once owned the Shelter they knew the area very well. It was perhaps what had also been Sach's downfall as he had been overconfident.

'Sach warned me not to repeat the same mistake that they had made. One Horn should not be there, but I need to remain cautious and act under the worst case assumption that there might be a Dalki just as strong there..'

Three men came out of the jungle in full beast gear. Underneath it was their military uniform. They gave a quick salute before handing in their report.

"Sir, we have finished scouting out the area as per your instructions. The Dalki are indeed still present. From what we could find out there has been little to no interaction between them and the humans in the Shelter so far."

"However, from what we could see it appears that the Dalki have spread out in a shape that allows them to act as sentries. Those on guard outside consist of eight single spiked Dalki, two, two spiked Dalki and finally a single three spiked Dalki who should be their leader."

Taking this information in, the Dalki forces here were smaller than all those that had been sent to the other planets. They outnumbered the Dalki greatly which was good news all apart from one fact.

'We should be able to handle one spiked and two spiked Dalki, especially if we can manage to divide and conquer them. But the three spike‚Ä¶ we might need to isolate him first or last to stand much of a chance‚Ä¶'

Next it was Nathan's job to sort an attack force that could deal with the issue. Unfortunately, retreat wasn't really an option. The fact that the Dalki remained here and even went so far to protect this place, especially when they had launched an assault on other planets, meant that something on this planet was of great importance to them.

Unfortunately, given the circumstances, Nathan couldn't call for reinforcement.

This was a special task that had been given to him, the more people that knew about it, the higher the chance one of the V would find out, leak it and thereby cause all sorts of problems. On top of that, there weren't really any reinforcements to help in the first place.

'The best course of action would be to have no confrontation in the first place, maybe I'm missing something.' Nathan thought as he continued to look over the files. The others were getting anxious and riled up, thinking that they were about to go into full combat any second now, but Nathan was sure that patience was the right answer in this situation.

'The reports‚Ä¶what if we were wrong? I've spent a long time with Quinn and the others, so I know more about the V than anyone else here. Not only do their eyes turn red and they use the strange red aura for attacks, but their nose is so sensitive it can distinguish between humans and themselves. We aren't too far away from the Shelter, so shouldn't they have picked us up by now?'

'The reports also never specified any cases of V actually being spotted here‚Ä¶ Are these humans that are with the Dalki really working with the V? Rather than working with, could it be that the people are actually their prisoners? In that case, could it be that they're less worried about someone coming in and more about those people escaping?'

Still, this theory raised the question of why Dalki, who had never been known to take prisoners, would go out of their way now? What's more the reports agreed that the inhabitants of the Shelter had fought back together with the Dalki.

'That could just be due to us attacking them aggressively. At the time, the people must have been afraid due to the existence of the V, so they properly didn't take the time to check them out.'

With this new idea in his head. Nathan ordered those three to watch if any of the humans ever left the Shelter, and if so to find out what they were doing. This way he could determine if they were collaborating or if they really were prisoners or not. ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

A while later Nathan had received another report from his scout group.

"We have been observing them for a while now. The Dalki attack any of the beasts that enter the area. Once in a while a group of humans go out of the Shelter to gather resources and water from a river not too far. During this time, a single Dalki will head out with them."

The group consisted of five people. It was a small number of people allowed to leave the Shelter. Clearly not enough for them to overpower the single Dalki. It was looking more and more like Nathan's new theory was right and that the people weren't the Dalki's allies but prisoners.

"Assemble two squads. I want the ten strongest men in terms of single attack strength abilities, and make sure that their abilities don't make much noise either. Their goal will be to kill the Dalki who accompany the people. After that make sure to capture the humans with them ALIVE! Get one of our intelligence agents on standby as well, some questions are going to have to be answered."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Soon enough ten men gathered in front of Nathan, and with the information of the route and scouting team, they were able to all move together well due to the information. This was the way one would use the advantage of numbers, without necessarily needing all of them to be top fighters.

When they had finally reached the river, they could see the group of people gathering large amounts of water. The Dalki stood next to them on watch. During this period, Nathan started to gather his ability in his hands, readying a bubble that was larger than any other.

"Okay, now!" Nathan ordered.

Immediately, coming out from the jungle forest, the group of ten all used their abilities against the single spiked Dalki. One squad aimed at his head while the other at his heart to ensure he would die in that one shot. Meanwhile, Nathan had run forward to encase all of the humans by the river in a giant bubble to ensure they wouldn't inform the other Dalki.

The humans were shocked and hesitated about whether to help the Dalki or not. Two of them recognised the military uniforms, so they tried to use their abilities on the military personnel. However, while in the bubble they realised that something was wrong.

"What is this? Why isn't my ability working?!" A man shouted in panic.

Nathan's ability may not necessarily be the strongest, but it was perfect for dealing with other ability users, who weren't too much stronger than him. Looking to his left, he could see that his people had already accomplished their task, the Dalki had died before injuring any of them.

When there was only one, a burst option of strong abilities was the best option, due to the Dalki's nature of getting stronger the more injured they were. Now that they were free, Nathan didn't have to worry so much about having to fight the humans.

"Now that the Dalki has been dealt with, I just have some questions I want to ask you. Please cooperate with us, so we can save everyone inside the Shelter." Nathan hoped that this approach wouldn't be met with resistance from them.

Nathan made a sign for the other ten who still had their weapons drawn and abilities active to lower them, so that a fight could be avoided. Although they were inside his bubble, the people could still use their beast gear, and if they were to step out use their abilities again. Of course he didn't reveal that to the four of them.

'Wait, why are there only four of them this time? Didn't the report say that the humans always traveled in groups of five?'

"Let them go, or I will be the one to take care of you all!" A female voice shouted from behind.

Turning around, a little down the river, Nathan could see a dark skinned woman with long braided hair, but what stood out about her the most was the weapon she had in her hand. It was glowing and pointing towards them. One felt cold just looking at the weapon.

'That's the‚Ä¶Demon tier weapon!' Nathan instantly recognised it. 'Why did the Dalki hand it over instead of keeping it for themselves? Were we unlucky‚Ä¶ or was all of this a trap to lure us out?'
