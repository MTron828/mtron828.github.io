Xox continued to blink a couple of times, he wasn't sure how the situation was going to play out, he just never expected it to head into this situation. 

'Damn it, damn it!' Xox screamed in his head. 'Yongbu already did me a huge favour by getting me in this meeting, and he was the one who told me not to get involved. Will he even come if I ask him to? I could send him a message, and see what he says, but judging by his reaction from before.'

A nervous smile appeared on Xox's face, his lips opened slowly. He felt like multiple words were trying to come out of his mouth at the same time, but noise did eventually come out. 

"Yongbu is a very difficult person to get hold of, as you can see he is busy from time to time. If you sent me back, then I can always return with him next time?" Xox said, trying to put on the most gentle face possible. 

He was attempting a puppy-like look with his face, and tilted his head slightly, but it wasn't quite working, with the grasp of Layla's hands getting stronger, making it harder for him to breathe. 

"Ah I see, look who is making the excuses now about who can arrive. I assure you Quinn is actually a very busy person. Remember, if what you are saying is true, Yongbu is the one that wishes to apologise, so the least he could do was make time for us, that is unless your lying."

Opening her mouth slightly, Xox could already feel the heat building up and see a faint glow at the back of her throat. He wasn't too sure if he would survive an attack or not, most likely he would but then what would he do after. 

The Ancient One had told him this was an undercover mission! Biting the bullet, there was only one thing he could do, and it was sending a message to Yongbu. 

[I need your help, my long lost loyal brother. You were right, the Talen family is indeed crazy. I am in a bit of a pickle of a situation, as I have been caught. Please help me out this one last time.]

[I promise I will never threaten to reveal your condition, and I will do everything in my power to help you out with yours and if you have a problem in the future. You know I am well connected, and the person I am helping out now, will be able to give you anything you want.]

[I just need you to come here, and state that you sent me to apologise on your behalf, for what you did back then.]

Yongbu and Xox hadn't been close for long, but it was the only thing he could rely on in his current situation. He had to hope that the message he had sent was enough to convince him. 

"Well?" Layla asked again. 

"I have contacted him!" Xox yelped. "He will be here, I just don't know when."

The nervous smile was still on Xox's face until he could feel energy coming from his side. There was a faint glow like that of a ball, the ball started to expand, and out from it came a large muscular sea creature that had a human body with tentacles covering his mouth and large wings on his back. 

[You came for me, and so quickly!]

Xox had sent a message. 

[It wasn't quick.] Xox sent a message back through the celestial system. [I was in the celestial space. I was debating over it for a long time, but I kept feeling guilty about your situation.]

Yongbu stayed away from the two, he could see that Layla was tensing up at the sight of him. It was a reasonable reaction considering what he had done last time, so to play it safe Yongbu even got down on his knees. 

"I apologise for turning up out of the blue, now of all times." Yongbu lowered his head. 

This action came as a surprise to Xox. They were gods, and even though they were in a tough situation, it would be rare for anyone to see them bow, even for their life because many of them didn't fear death. 

It just went to show, perhaps, how fearful Yongbu was of the Talen family.

"I apologise for appearing now." Yongbu said. "What my messenger has stated is true. He is a fool, an idiot, and the biggest piece of crap I know." 

It was a chance for Yongbu to curse Xox without him being able to say anything back. It was the minimum amount of enjoyment he should receive for being put in this situation.

"I apologise again for sending someone else other than myself. It was just after what I did, I thought you would be filled with anger if I was to arrive myself. We know Quinn is a special being, he is a great person, and I deeply regret what I put your family through back then. I want you to understand it was just orders, and as the god that overlooks the Mermerials, I wish the Mermerials as well as my relationship with you two will continue to grow closer together rather than further apart."

Xox was impressed, he thought he was the one with the sweet mouth, able to sooth over any situation but Yongbu had put it better than he ever could have.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Layal let go of Xox after hearing these words but then walked over to Yongbu she stood next to him to show that there was no fear. 

"I heard from the elders that you were going to help them with problems back on the Mermerial planet." Layla stated. "You better keep your promise, otherwise I will never believe a word you say again. 

"From now on, if you wish to meet, we do so in person, but you inform me beforehand. Whether it's through the elders or some other way, you always are to contact me first before appearing in person, and if you go near any of my family and not to me or Quinn, I don't care if you're gods or not, I will do everything in my power to protect my family." 

"I understand." Yongbu replied. 

Layla moved away, and Yongbu knew it was a signal for them to both go. He went over to Xoxy, and held his arm, moments later they turned into nothing but balls of light and returned back to the Mermerial planet, the beach the two were on from before. 

"I told you they were crazy." Yongbu said. "And she's more crazy than I thought, who in their right mind would say that to gods, especially if they knew what we were. It's not like she overpowered me back then either."

Xox was lying in the sand, he was glad the tense situation was over, as he turned around and looked at the sky, he realised his problem wasn't over though. 

'And I have to go back… I need to complete the job the celestial asked me to do, but how do I go back now?' 

A memory came to Xox, when he had infiltrated the school, he remembered the teachers talking about something. 

'It was the Grand Meet Up!' Xox thought. 'Where vampires from all over are going to the settlement. I could disguise myself as a vampire, and find out where Quinn is.  I have to, otherwise the Ancient Ones are going to get rid of me.'

The Grand Meet Up, the first celebration the vampires would have that brought the Graylash vampires , the Vampire Corps, and the Settlement vampires together. It was meant to be a joyous event, but no one had any idea, the grand misfortune it would bring, and the ripple effects it would have, on the whole Golden space.
