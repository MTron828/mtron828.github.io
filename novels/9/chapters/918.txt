Chapter 919 - Rooting for the enemy

The continued explosions were going off all over the vampire settlement and the screams from the vampires continued along with it. The vampires that had just left the square and were returning to their homes, were now suddenly running about in a panic and soon the sound of fighting could be heard as well.

It was apparent that the explosions going off all over the settlement went from any special devices of any sort, but it was from fighting. From vampires using abilities against each other.

The leaders that were sent off to deal with the commotion were trying their best to settle everyone down and find out where the explosions were coming from and what was just happening exactly. One of these leaders in particular was Sunny, leader of the Fifth family. She was extremely worried about members of her family as they were considered weak.

Her ability allowed her family members to communicate with familiars, but due to the rule surrounding familiars, there weren‚Äôt many vampires in her family that didn‚Äôt have them, so they were to fend for themselves.

At the same time, not all vampires in the settlement were fighters. They had greater strength than your average human, but some didn‚Äôt strive to be stronger and just enjoyed living their day to day life in the settlement.

Being from the fifth family she had more settlers than other families.

Trying to get to the commotion located closest to her castle area as quickly as she could, she summoned her familiar, and soon a large black wolf the size of a house was seen by her side with a horn sticking out from the top of its head. What was unique about this wolf was it was able to change its size and on its front paws it had beast equipment to power it‚Äôs attacks even further.

Shrinking down, the wolf eventually was the size of a small elephant and was now half the size of what it was before.

"Noir, I will need your help, we have to get to the castle as quickly as possible." She ordered, as she quickly jumped on the giant black wolf‚Äôs back.

Noir nooded, understanding what her master‚Äôs d.e.s.i.r.e was and was off.

Noir was fast, even hard for a vampire to keep up with. Her speed was her main trait that she used when fighting, but they didn‚Äôt get far before Sunny had spotted someone she knew quite well. It was Rokene, with his own little black rabbit familiar, and he was crying out for help while dragging a student over his shoulder.

"He‚Äôs hurt! Come on help!" He shouted.

Sunny jumped off from Noir and tried her best to help as she could.

"Here, give him some blood. He should be able to recover faster." She said while handing over a flask, but she knew she wouldn‚Äôt be able to do this with all those she would come across. She only carried a few flasks with her for emergencies as most vampires did, but with this level of damage they needed something better.

"Can you explain to me what happened? Why is he hurt so bad, what is attaking them?" She asked.

"It‚Äôs those from the Eighth family. Those in the pooling area and those from their inner castle. They‚Äôre attacking everyone left and right, any vampire they can see, regardless of what family they are from. The other vampires have started to attack back, but.... Some of them are our friends. They are hesitant while the eighth family doesn‚Äôt seem to care. Why is this happening!" Rokene shouted desperately, hoping that he would get an answer, but Sunny had no clue.

This wasn‚Äôt something Cindy‚Äôs ability was capable of, nor Jill‚Äôs either.

‚ÄôAre the whole of the Eighth family in on this, it can‚Äôt be. Unless they were threatened with something, or does it have something to do with the original?‚Äô

While in the middle of her thoughts and checking if the vampire from the Fifth family had recovered, from the roof of one of the houses, a vampire had leapt off and was ready to claw their eyes out as it fell down.

Thinking fast and using her legs, Sunny kicked Rokene and the injured vampire away. With her strength she was able to send them quite the distance sliding across the floor. At the same time, she rolled backwards and the vampire‚Äôs claws had dug into the ground.

It didn‚Äôt take long after for Sunny to deal with the vampire. Once getting up from her roll she kicked his elbow, breaking it, then grabbed the back of the vampire‚Äôs neck and slammed their head into the floor.

She lifted it again, making sure he was still alive.

"You have committed a great sin, attacking one of the vampire leaders!" Sunny stated, but realised saying any of this was useless. "Tell me why you are doing this?"

When looking at the vampire‚Äôs eyes, even though he was looking at her, at the same time she felt like the vampire wasn‚Äôt really seeing her.

"These images...these images, the voices...Get them out of my mind! You demons....you demons I need to get rid of them...I need to protect everyone...Get rid of them all!" The man screamed, and soon, Sunny had hit him at the back of the head hard enough to knock him out.

"Those in the Eighth family are attacking everyone, but I don‚Äôt think they are doing it of their own will. The vampires are losing their lives on both sides for no reason. Not all the vampires are strong enough to do what I just did, I have to help." She thought, gritting her teeth.

"We have to help everyone we can. Rokene, everyone I knock out I want you to pile on the back of Noir. Once we have gathered ten people, then take them to the Thirteenth family. Tell them to use their string to tie them up. We‚Äôre going to try and save as many vampires as possible."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Back at the plaza square, fighting between the leaders and the others had already started, and it seemed like the other leaders that had been awoken were experiencing the same thing as those from the Eighth family.

When the other leaders tried to call out to them, they didn‚Äôt respond and instead it appeared as if they were mumbling away.

At the moment certain groups had formed to fight against the leaders. Paul and Kyle who had just been fighting moments ago, were now going up against one of the Eighth leaders.

The vampire knights who were replacing Prima the 12th and Kyle the 7th family leader had also gone off to help on their order, for they feared that the opponents they would be facing were too strong.

There were rumors going around that the vampires were unsure of whether they were true or not, but it was commonly heard amongst the vampires that each generation the vampires got weaker and weaker as the blood line diverged. If it was true, even though they were leaders going up against other leaders it wouldn‚Äôt be too easy of a fight.

The groups had teamed up, Leo and Borden against the original leader Remus, Paul and Prima against one of the other Eighth leaders, David and Suzan against another eight leaders, and Jill against Jin.

Some of these groups naturally formed as leaders tried to make up for their weaknesses, and there were those like Jin who were confident in their strength.

As for those that belonged to the Tenth family that had come along, including Silver, they were busy dealing with the vampires that were beginning to enter the square. Those from the Eighth families were rushing to the square almost like mad men, and to support them was Kazz as well.

"Will Leo and Borden be okay against that original?" Quinn said, concerned but he had his own worries. Up until the last moment, they had been sedating Quinn with Suzan‚Äôs needles, stopping him from recovering his power. However, thanks to Bryce visiting him and the execution being delayed he was able to recover his MC cells and some of his Qi, but not all of it.

Using the shadow void skill he could create a space that allowed his MC cells to restore twice as fast, but then he wouldn‚Äôt be able to see anything that was happening on the outside. It was a struggle but just thinking about it would waste more time. FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

If he helped now, he would only be able to fight at a fraction of his true strength, but there was one thing he could still do - turn into a blood sucker, but that was a huge risk.

"What‚Äôs with that look on your face?" Bryce asked Quinn. "The day I ask you for help will be the end of me."

Standing by Bryce‚Äôs side was Prima, who was ready to support Quinn and Bryce and also had a determined look on his face.

"The one that will cause us all trouble is not the Original, it‚Äôs her." Bryce said, as the two of them were ready to take her on.

Quinn couldn‚Äôt believe it, but right now he was rooting for one of his enemies.
