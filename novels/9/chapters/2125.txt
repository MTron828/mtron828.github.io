If Quinn was thinking properly, then he could have guessed that the two that wished to meet him would have been these two. The thing was, he had pushed the thought to the very back of his mind, because he didn't want it to become a reality.

For some reason, someone who was very loyal to Quinn was working alongside Bliss. A meddlesome celestial who believed she was doing things for the sake of the human race, but the way Quinn saw it, she was able to do so much, yet chose to do so little.

"I'm happy to see that you and your family are safe." Sam stated first, as he moved a bit closer, but stopped as he saw the look in Quinn's eyes.

"Why are you mentioning my family?" Quinn said.

At one point, he would have loved to have introduced his family to Sam. However, the fact that he was by her side was what made him untrusting to a certain degree.

"There is no need to be so hostile towards us." Bliss said, as she sat calmly on the outside seats of the platform, not taking Quinn's threat so seriously. "Have we ever harmed you before?"

Quinn laughed at the statement.

"You harmed my family, and don't think for a second if in those visions of yours if you ever saw that getting rid of my family would be more beneficial to you, that you wouldn't do it. The only reason why I haven't sent you back into the reincarnation cycle is because I only just arrived on this planet and don't want to cause any trouble.

"As for you Sam, I still consider you somewhat a friend."

A smile appeared on Sam's face as he heard that, all though it was slightly a nervous smile due to the choice of words.

"I will always consider you a friend Quinn, no matter what you think of me." Sam replied. "Whether you believe it or not, that is why we are here."

When Sam was speaking, Quinn seemed to calm down a little, so he decided that it was best to hear them out.

"Before you say anything, there is a lot I need to get off my chest." Quinn stated. "The fact that you are here must mean that you saw a vision that I would eventually arrive here. So then why, why didn't you get involved sooner, why didn't you tell me what was going to happen to Sil? Tell me what's going to happen so we can prevent these things!"

Bliss sighed at that moment.

"And why do you keep asking the same question every time we meet, and not expect the same answer, are you mad?"

Quinn didn't say anything and instantly moved from his position, his hand reached out and his fingers wrapped around Bliss's throat. She tried to lift her staff but the shadow from Quinn pushed the staff ripping it out from her hand and was holding it in place.

"Mad! Of course I'm mad, my friends died. They died right in front of my eyes, and you are alive!" Quinn shouted. "If you can't help them, then what's the point of you being alive."

"Quinn!" Sam called out and grabbed hold of his other arm. "You need her, believe it or not, it's because she has only dabbled here and there that things haven't turned out far worse. You are only thinking about the current life that we live in now, not the one that could have been.

"The celestials you knew nothing about but managed to gather all of their attention, and even the planet we are on now. Isn't the reason why you can bring your family to safety here, because of what Bliss did in sending you away. There are more paths than you can even imagine, and right now we are here to do the same thing again. I know you don't trust her but somewhere deep down you still trust me right?" Sam asked. "I'm your strategist, the strategist for the Cursed faction‚Ä¶ always planning to do what's best for the faction and that includes you Quinn."

Sam's words‚Ä¶ they always sounded so confident, and because they were coming from him, they were pulling at Quinn's heart strings a bit. He weakened his grip, and quickly moved away, while letting go of the staff.

'He‚Ä¶ has grown incredibly strong. I doubt that there is a god slayer out there that is as strong as him.' Bliss thought, as she rubbed her neck a little.Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

"Now I can speak." She said as she held the staff closer toward her. "I'm sure you are aware already, but Jack and Jim have begun their conquest. They are taking over one planet at a time with their new army, and when it comes to power they are unmatched.

"The celestials will see this as a threat, but it will be too late, and in the end the Universe will act out, creating a great reset, do you know what this means?"

"A reset?" Quinn replied.

"It means the Universe will restart. It will decide to start again from scratch. Getting rid of everything that is in place at the moment to create a balance. There will be no celestials, there will be no god slayers, there will be no humans. It will be as if none of us ever existed in the first place.

"You see, Jim and Jack's armies are both evolving in their own ways. As the Dalki obtain more spikes, more and more will reach god slayer status. The vampire's strength increases due to the green blood, so in turn the vampires also grow stronger.

"On top of that, I'm sure Jim has other methods and uses of getting himself and others stronger. The thing is, they don't even realise what future they are heading towards themselves, and even if we were to tell them, do you think they would believe us?

"The celestials will think it's a trick and the same with Jim and Jack, but then there is you Quinn‚Ä¶ in the middle of it all."

Despite everything that Quinn had been through and everything he had seen, trying to imagine a reset. The Universe just restarting like that was hard to comprehend.

"There is a turning point." Bliss said. "During their conquest they will go from planet to planet, and they will eventually reach these planets. Not even the Mermerials are safe. In my vision, a great war takes place and you will lose the fight, nearly all will end up dead.

"You manage to escape, and move to the next planet, where the same happens again. You train, and try to get stronger which you do, but so does the enemy. Their numbers, their overwhelming force is just too much for you to handle.

"Each time you run away, the situation just gets worse. Which is why Quinn, you need to gather allies by your side once again. Gather and use anyone you can to stop them once and for all.

"Don't try and fight this fight alone, and don't be afraid of going against those that were once your ally."

This wasn't the first time Quinn had heard this, Logan had said the same thing. Thinking about his powers and what was currently in his shadow space, maybe there was a way for him to create an army.

"Quinn, there are planets out there, with races that have great strength. Strength that is far greater than humans, equal to the vampires and some of the Dalki, but they won't just take a stranger's word for it.

"You need to convince them, convince them that you need their help, convince them that with you, following your lead, that you will have the confidence to take out the threat that is heading towards destroying the universe." Sam placed both hands on his shoulder, and then pulled something out of his pocket, it was a small nano stick.

"If you trust us, head to these coordinates, and we will be doing our best to help you when the time comes."

Sam stood back, standing next to Bliss and her staff started to light up, it looked like they were leaving, but before they did Sam had one more thing to say.

"On that stick, there is a gift for you‚Ä¶ It took a lot to get that, but I hope you can forgive your parents."

The two of them flashed away, while Quinn held out his hand.

"Wait what‚Ä¶ my parents!"
