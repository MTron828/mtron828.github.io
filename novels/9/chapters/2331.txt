There was a small problem the group had to solve to be able to get to where Logan was, and that was to get a ship. There was no doubt that the vampire corps unit would be looking for Jessica at every port and any mode of public transport they were going to use.

At the same time, they were unable to just run there because Green City was unique in that it was built on top of the sea.

Which meant they would have to steal a ship. Hikel, Edvard, and Quinn's faces weren't well-known among the vampire corps members, but Galanar and Jessica were. After ditching their clothes, they walked into one of the space stations.

Everything was going well so far, but they had no ticket to pick up a ship to use, but that wasn't too much of a problem either. Going away from the group for a moment, using his influence skill on a random vampire, Quinn had somewhat forced one to give him a ticket.

The same trick had been used to pass security as well until they eventually were inside a random Travelers ship. It was a bit small, but there wasn't a lot of them in the first place, and they wouldn't be going too far anyway.

"Wow, how did you do that?" Galanar said as Edvard went over the controls and started to press a few buttons. Quinn had shown him how to navigate a spaceship, and surprisingly, as technology got better, it was more interactive to fly one of these things.

"How are you able to use the influence skill on all of the vampires back there? There wasn't even a hint of pushback," Galanar said.

It was an amazing feat, one that a vampire could never imagine doing to another vampire unless they were at least at the level of one of the vampire leaders.

"I've had a lot of practice," Quinn answered, thinking that things would have been a lot easier if he was able to use his shadow, but for now, there was even a chance that Galanar had been marked by Immortui.

They had asked questions that led them to believe he hadn't been, but they all knew what happened the last time they trusted the influence skill too much.

'Of course he's strong. If he's someone Quinn trusts with this whole mess, then he has to be strong to a degree,' Jessica thought.

The ship was in orbit heading to its destination. It was left on autopilot, and they thought it was a good time to talk to Jessica a little bit more about her whole situation.

Quinn went ahead to sit in front of her, meanwhile, Edvard and Hikel decided to take Galanar away, trying to make noise so he was unable to hear their conversation, just in case he was a spy.

"Wait, hey!" Galanar wanted to complain, but when he tried to push against Edvard and Hikel's bodies, they didn't budge an inch. It was then that he realized they were far physically stronger than him.

"I couldn't say it before, but I will try to explain to the best of my ability," Quinn said. "Someone out there knows that you're a dhampir. And I don't know how, but they want to use this fact for you to help them with something.

"This person is extremely powerful, though. They are able to control people to do their bidding. It's hard to trust anyone because at any time they could be working for this person."

It was a big shock to Jessica, but in a lot of ways, it was a relief to her. It meant that the vampire corps weren't really after her, nor was it these people's fault, but more so this single person.

However, when she thought about it more, it meant she was right. People like Stacy and Gabe, they died because this person was after her, and it was to do with her Dhampire self after all.

"Hey, not to be the cause of alarm, but it looks like there are a few ships following us," Edvard said.

On the front of the ship's glass display, a rear camera was projected, and they could see four small black ships heading towards them.

"Those are the Vampire corps ships!" Galanar called out.

It wasn't going to be a problem as Quinn quickly went to head outside, but Jessica had grabbed his hand before he did.

"Please... you said this isn't of their own doing, right? If possible, can you try not to kill them?" Jessica asked.

He didn't say anything else as he walked up to the door and pressed a button. It opened up the back, and a massive amount of wind was let into the ship. He could see the energy blasts getting ready to fire at them.

Gathering his aura in his fingertip, Jessica was feeling something rise in her. Her eye was glowing so bright that it was going through the contact.

A blood bullet shot out from Quinn's finger, more than one, and each time blood fired from his finger, an explosion would follow. Perfectly aimed, the bullets hit the weapons onboard the ship.

They now had no way to attack other than crashing the ship into theirs, but he wouldn't put it past them to do something like that, which was why he continued to fire away and hit the bottom of the ship. It skewed their balance, and they had no choice but to emergency land and stop the chase.

A frightening situation for Galanar, which made him fear for his life, was solved in a few moments. The back of the ship door was shut, and Quinn went back to his position, passing Galanar with his mouth wide open.

"Thank you for doing that. I knew you could do it," Jessica smiled.

There were no more instances in their travel, and they had finally arrived at Green City. The ship was already given access by Logan to head straight to the tower, where a private space would open up to allow Quinn to dock his ship, essentially where the lab was and where Logan spent most of his time.

There to greet the group as they descended from the ship were a few androids with drinks and hot towels for them all.Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

"If you follow me, I will take you to the master," the android said after giving everyone their drinks.

They were in a hangar of some sort, but after going through a thick steel door following the android, lots of white walls and white light came into view. It was a common feeling when visiting a place of Logan's.

He looked to be busy at a workbench, with strange tools in his hands and coming out of his back. He was always making something, but what might have been even more surprising was the person by his side, Agent 4.

'Agent 4... wasn't he the one that used the red heart to open the portal to the other plane in the first place?' Seeing him immediately put Quinn on guard.

"I know what you are thinking, but he is on our side," Logan said, stopping the work on his own project, putting his tools away, and walking to the others.

"He didn't quite know what he was getting into back then, and unlike Zero, Agent 4 was never a direct follower of Immortui, but he was by one's side for a very long time, so I believe he can help us quite a bit in all of this," Logan explained.

The group had gathered at a desk, and the androids were told to give Galanar a tour of the place. They had felt quite bad for Galanar as he was being left out of everything, but he seemed more than happy to explore the large Green Tower, a place he thought he would never get to enter.

"I will tell you everything I know, but I doubt it will be able to help you very much," Agent 4 stated. "Immortui's goal has always been to cross over to this side, and to do that, there are several things that need to be in place.

"First, Immortui himself. A large amount of energy is needed on both sides to open a portal of sorts.

"The reason I believe Immortui had started so many wars using his dedicated followers was because he was gathering his own energy. As we all know now, Celestials need to complete their condition to access more Celestial energy, and Immortui's seems to be linked to death.

"Every single war that's happened, and every conflict, has made him grow stronger. However, even with all this strength, he is unable to open up a hole to the other side. So enough energy is needed to open up a small hole, then he himself can do the rest.

"He gained followers by promising to bring back those who are dead. I don't know what proof he has to show this, but I will tell you now, Zero was pretty certain he was capable of doing such a thing.

"The truth is, he probably expected one of two things: for one of his followers to get strong enough to open a hole for him, or his own strength to reach a point. But then there was a third way, one much quicker‚Äîthose with the power to open up a hole to the other side."

Jessica didn't quite follow what they were saying as she only understood some of it, but what Agent 4 had just said reminded her greatly of the dream she had, one of her opening up a strange hole in the sky.

The dream was starting to feel more like a prediction.
