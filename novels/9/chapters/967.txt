Chapter 968 - Two wrongs

Walking through the hallway, the kids were returning to their homeroom classroom wondering what they had just witnessed. Their emotions were on a rollercoaster ride during the whole thing. They were panicking throughout and all of sudden, they were now walking back to their homeroom class.

No punishment had been received towards any of them, and miraculously, they had just witnessed a worried looking Erlen, and his father who was kneeling and begging on the floor. All of this was due to their teacher, General Hardy.

The kids didn’t say anything, as it was taking each of them a while to process what they had just seen. It was clear that Erlen had the head general of the third group on their side, but still when compared to their own teacher, it seemed like he was untouchable.

"Teacher, you’re amazing." Venus mumbled.

At that moment, they had nearly reached their classroom, and hearing the words from the kids, he realised that he had better say something. He turned around to them and looked at Sil and Chucky. It looked like the two of them had got involved trying to protect the kids.

When they were listing out the injuries on all the students, Quinn could only assume that Sil had something to do with it, and he was thankful that Sil didn’t go too far.

"I want to talk to you guys about what just happened. As a teacher, I think it’s my duty to say that two wrongs don’t make a right." Quinn said. "What I did just there, I abused my power and used it against them. I don’t want you guys to grow up like that."

Swin and Venus looked at each other, as if they didn’t understand quite what Quinn was saying.

"Teacher, we don’t think you abused your power. You could have done that from the beginning but you didn’t. Until it felt like we were in a corner. You used your power to help against what you thought was an injustice. They were the real abuse of power!" Swin said. "You only used it when you felt like it was necessary while those guys used it everyday."

It made him feel a little better that the kids didn’t see him as the big bad guy in the situation, but he just wanted to make it clear to them.

"If you can keep what happened a secret, that would be for the best." Quinn said, giving them all a wink.

When they were just about to reach their classroom door, Shiro, who hadn’t said a word, just felt like he had to say what was on his mind.

"General Hardy, who are you? I thought you said you were a low level like me...I know you’re a Head General, but no Head General can do something like that..." Shiro stated.

Looking at the young boy, who reminded Quinn a lot like himself, he thought it would be good to have someone like him join the Cursed faction, before he could be ruined by the current society.

"The Cursed faction are stronger than you think." Quinn left it at that, entering the class and the lesson had begun.

It was safe to say that during class, the kids couldn’t concentrate at all on what Quinn was talking about. They kept thinking about how they were saved, and so spectacularly.

’This guy, he is super strong, has high level beast gear, and was able to do something like that to Erlen’s family?" Venus thought. ’He is not a normal person, but I’ve never heard of him.’

At the same time though, due to how quick those in the Cursed faction had risen, there weren’t many that knew a lot about them. When the bell rang and it was the end of the homeroom class, Venus and Swin noticed that their teacher had requested for Sil and Chucky to stay behind.

They thought that their names might get called too, but it never did happen. They thought it was a little strange but nothing too out of the ordinary since they were also involved in the incidents the other day. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The reason why Quinn had called them, was because he wanted to hear the full story of what had really happened that day. Why the two of them were there and how everything had started.

"Well, it looks like you did a really good job, Sil. I’m proud of you." Quinn said, putting his hand on his shoulder.

Hearing the praise, made Sil act in a strange way, and he placed his head slightly downward.

"It’s nothing, I just thought ’what would Vorden do’ if he was here."

Hearing about this, reminded Quinn of when he was in school. Vorden would often come back beaten and bruised, and it was only later he found out that Vorden was going around beating all those that were abusing their powers.

"Yes, and hopefully Vorden will be back soon, remember what you need to do." Said Quinn.

’This isn’t a good sign. It reminds me of how Peter was at one point, if he gets a strong power, he could very well attempt to use it to get revenge on all those that bullied him.’ Quinn thought.

Although Quinn had to admit when he was younger, he had harboured these same thoughts as well. But he realised that most of the time it wasn’t the individual’s fault, but rather a problem with the whole system. It was a change that would take some time to achieve.

Later that day, when it was the school lunch break, Venus and Swin were both looking for somewhere to sit. After the incident, most of those in their class were still trying to avoid them. Afraid that they too would get attacked by Erlen and his gang if they got close to them.

They didn’t know about the extraordinary events that had occurred and they were fighting everything in their body to hold it in. That’s when they spotted Shiro sitting on his own and decided to sit with him.

The three of them now, although didn’t have much in common before, now all shared a certain bond, and had one thing they loved to talk about. Their favourite teacher, General Hardy. It seemed like they had all come to the same conclusion, Hardy had to be a fake name.

"In this day and age, it’s quite common for popular people to only be known by their name rather than what they look like, so maybe he used that to his advantage." Swin said.

"Ah, like those famous power fighter players. Some of them never reveal who they are in real life." Venus replied.

In the middle of their conversation, they spotted someone entering the room, and it was Erlen. It was still the same day that the incident had happened, so he didn’t yet have time to take in everything that had occured, and who knows how the conversation between him and his father had gone. But one thing was clear, he wasn’t acting himself.

Usually, people would allow him to pass to grab his food first, but he just waited in line like everyone else, getting his tray of food like a zombie. When he sat down, he didn’t touch any of his food and just looked at it. His eyes were puffy and red as if he had been crying the whole time, and the side of his cheek was red.

Quite possibly, after finding out what happened and everything his father had built up, he had put the blame on his son for losing it all, and was now dishing out punishment on him.

It was hard for the others to feel sorry for him though, they had years of abuse, and their injuries were far worse. They were just hoping that Erlen would learn from this.

——

After what had happened today, there was another group that was stunned by what they had just seen. In Innu’s room; Innu, Samantha, Sach and Hayley were all sitting down together.

"I just got an update form the company, it looks like all the contracts are going to be continued as per usual." Samantha said. "Also it seems to all be true, the Green family has taken over the company and now it belongs to the Cursed faction."

"Who would have thought?" Sach said. "The Green family and the Cursed working together!"

"The person who Hardy called, I’ve seen him before." Hayley mentioned. "When the fight was going on for electing the next big power, he was there along with the Bree family, working with Mona."

"Does that mean that the Cursed faction took him in after the Bree family disbanded?" Innu asked.

"I’m not sure, but the Cursed family seem to have a lot more allies than people think on the surface, as you can see." Hayley said, wondering herself as she knew her father, Paul, an ex-head general, was also part of the Cursed faction.

"I think I’m starting to understand why Oscar told us to try to get the Cursed faction on our side." Samantha blurted out.

Hearing this, set the other two aback a bit as well. They were hoping that Oscar might be a help to them, but if Oscar cared about the Cursed faction, then they might not see eye to eye.

"Yes, but did you see how he is acting? He acts like he owns the military and that he can come and do whatever he likes!" Innu shouted.

"Calm down." Sach said. "You had your chance and you failed, but I think I have something up my sleeve that might do the trick. He might have a strange ability, and connections but he has never fought us directly. I think we can figure out something."
