Chapter 1013 - Taking over

It was the first time Quinn had ever received a message about his system being overridden, and he was wondering just how it would have affected such a thing. After the system had been overridden, the main thing that had occurred was receiving a sudden quest, and it was a quest Quinn wasn’t expecting at all.

’Did he override the system just to give me that quest?’ Quinn thought as he lifted his head to confront the man who had dropped this giant of a bombshell, but he was no longer in front of him.

"Damn you, Richard Eno! You can’t just go off and treat everything as if it’s a game. People’s lives are at stake!" Quinn shouted in anger, but there was no one to hear his words.

Without the man responsible to ask any questions, Quinn now had to figure out things for himself. Usually, Quinn would receive a quest when he came face to face with an enemy, but this time was different. There wasn’t a Dalki in sight.

He could only assume it had something to do with the system being overridden. Still, he knew that they would be coming soon, because Eno had used the words, ’Running out of time’ And if he had disappeared so quickly, it was most likely the case. The main worrying thing was the apparent invasion that was coming soon were a group of 50 Dalki.

It was only two years ago that Quinn had come face to face with a single Dalki. With him and his group of friends, they still didn’t kill the Dalki and had to rely on Leo to save them.

Thinking about this, the first thing Quinn attempted to do was pull up the system to see if everything was working all okay. It seemed to be fine from a few test abilities he had activated using the system, and it looked like he could use it combat wise.

’With fifty Dalki, depending on the number of spikes they have, I don’t think everyone that is here is currently going to be enough, not when the students also need to be protected.’ Quinn thought.

The beast hunts were done in phases, and currently, two groups of classes were out together. In total, that would amount to 30,000 inexperienced students. The last thing Quinn wanted to see was all of them lying on the floor dead.

’To save as many lives as we can, I’m going to need as much help as I can get. If I can call Sil, Logan, Linda and all the others, we can stop this.’

Straight away, the first thing he attempted to do was get in contact with Logan through the mask. However, after several attempts, there was nothing. Not even a connection or signal had been made. No matter who Quinn tried to get in contact with, it just wouldn’t work.

’Is this Enos’ doing, or the Dalki?’ Quinn thought, but he couldn’t get Enos’ words out of his head that this was all some test. Right now, Quinn was afraid, if he used a shadow link to travel to one of the Cursed on the ship, how would he get back?

And he was right to think this way because all of the teleporters and communication devices throughout the whole Shelter had been jammed.

There was one more thing Quinn thought he could try, and that was summoning his vampire knights.

’I’m sorry Leo, I know you’re busy, but you will understand.’

When using the other skills throughout the system, no such message had appeared. It was only when trying to use this skill.

’It has to be Eno, because of what he did. When he said this is a test, does it mean I’m not allowed to get any outside help?’

’This truly meant that Quinn was now alone. He didn’t hesitate and, using all his speed, ran back to where all his students were and surprisingly they had already been gathered up by Peter. They all saw Quinn come in at super speed but hiding his powers was the least of his worries right now.

"What’s going on?" Quinn asked.

"It wasn’t too long ago, but while you were dealing with your thing, I received a message from Innu, telling everyone to meet up at the arranged location immediately. It sounded pretty urgent, but we wanted to wait for you." Peter said.

He was curious and wanted to ask Quinn some questions, but from the serious look on his face, he thought it was best to ask a little later.

’Innu asked to meet up quickly. I remember Eno saying something like he was delivering the message to three other people, was Innu one of them? If he’s gathering up all the students, is he trying to get it so all the teachers can protect them or head back into the Shelter?

’If all the students are gathered together, this might be a good thing, it’s going to be difficult, but if we can defeat the Dalki without having any of the kids get involved, I can protect them all if they’re in one place.’

Peter and Quinn were both off, and the students didn’t dare ask questions about what was going on. It was the first time they had seen Head general Hardy have such a severe look. For Swin, Venus and Shiro, it was the same look he had when he was filled with rage at Erlen.

On the way there, Quinn informed Peter of the possibility of what they could be going up against and soon they had arrived at the meeting point.

Quinn’s group were one of the last ones to arrive, and he could see all hundred teachers equipped with their best gear on and had a concerned look on their faces.

Using his inspect skill, Quinn was trying to see what help he had. Honestly, the teachers were a mixed bag. There were a couple of sergeants that Innu had brought with him, but the teachers, some of them were only a little better than the top students when it came to fighting, and Quinn wouldn’t doubt that there were some strong students as well.

Quinn had asked his students to line up, in their position with the other students, while in front of them, all hundred of the teachers had huddled in a type of group while talking to each other, and Innu was taking the lead.

"Now that all the teachers are here, I can go through everything from the beginning," Innu said. "We have just been informed that there could possibly be a Dalki invasion on this planet any second now. We don’t know if this is true or not, but I will treat it like the truth. We have to for such a big threat."

"I have tried to communicate with the Shelter, but it seems like no one else or I can get through. We don’t know where the Dalki will show up, but the Shelter is probably what they will be looking for and is the most essential thing that needs protecting.

"I want everyone to remember that we are soldiers, and even the students out there have trained so they can fight as well. I can’t imagine the Dalki sending a force larger than ten to deal with this planet since the forces are low, but I bet they weren’t expecting us to be having our expedition out here at the same time as their attack.

"We don’t know where they will be attacking, so I suggest us teachers split up into groups of ten, taking a squad of your strongest students, and a core of us will stay behind to protect the shelter."

Hearing this, Quinn thought he had spoken too soon. There wasn’t enough information to be making risky moves like Innu was suggesting, and at the same time, Innu was wrong. There were fifty of them coming.

"Innu, we shouldn’t do that." Quinn interrupted.

Innu looked at who was speaking and saw that it was general Hardy, he didn’t like him in the first place, and now he was interrupting him while this was a chance for them to claim glory against the Dalki.

"We don’t know how large or strong of a force the Dalki will be, and the students at the moment haven’t graduated. No matter how much we treat them like soldiers, this is only their first outing. You put them out there to rely on, and they will freeze. All of their blood will be on our hands as teachers!" Quinn shouted.

By now, the students at the front were able to hear everything that was being said, and they were nervous talking between them as they heard the words Dalki. They were already shivering with fear.

"Look what you have done!" Innu shouted, "Of course, the students will be frightened to do battle now, but when forced, humans do extraordinary things."

"So you weren’t even going to tell the students what they would be up against? What they would be risking their lives for! You’re sick Innu. I don’t care anymore. You are to step down, and I will take command from here on out!." Quinn demanded.

Innu started laughing.

"You think the teachers here will agree to that? Do you think anyone will follow you? Who are you, Hardy? You are a nobody. I personally fought in the last war and rose to the rank of head general. You may have the same rank as me in name, but it means nothing. I don’t take orders from you!" Innu shouted back.

It was clear Innu wasn’t going to listen, and with him taking command, he was sending all the students to a bloodfest, Quinn had no choice.

"I order you to listen to me!" Quinn shouted. "I will now be taking command of everyone and all the students here."

"You can’t do that, you fool! Didn’t you listen to anything I said?" Innu shouted again.

But Quinn’s eyes started to glow a ferocious red, making him back away and remembering their first meeting.

"I did listen, but I’m not a nobody," Quinn said, looking at all of the teachers. There was one thing Innu was right about, that they respected and trusted Innu more than him. He could see it in their eyes. So he only had one choice.

"I am Quinn Talen, head of the Cursed faction and one of the three world leaders. I will be taking over as commander from this point onwards!"

"He’s who..." Innu said.
