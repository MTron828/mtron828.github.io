Chapter 1160 Pure scum

It seemed as if everyone was off challenging new threats and going on exciting adventures... yet there was one member of the Cursed group that didn’t feel this way at all, and that was Fex. The vampire was currently on the roof of the Shelter’s tallest building, the main military base .

It would be hard for anyone to find him up there, as only the soldiers and Mechs guarding the Shelter wall would even be able to look that high. However, the distance was so great that they would have to have the sight of a vampire to see anything but a black dot, not that they had any reason to look for him in the first place.

’What’s with my luck today? I thought it was a good day when I got the chance to pilot that Mech, but this is the second time today I got assigned babysitting duty, while the others are off to have some fun.’ Fex clenched his fist in anger, as he looked at the one he blamed for his current situation.

With him on the roof of the building was Agent 11. He was the whole reason why Fex had made his way up here. The prisoner was sitting on a chair that the vampire had swiped from one of the rooms on the way up. His legs and arms were heavily bound with the red string.

Fex had made sure to not hold back, as lately they had snapped so many times that he had started to wonder about their durability. As long as Fex had time, he could reinforce the strength as much as he liked, preventing most from escaping. In a fight he only had minimal time, besides his string ability had always been meant for puppeteering, instead of their current utility.

’Should I perhaps create something like my father had? If I ask Alex he might be able to create a few things for me from beast gear. Maybe like an empty knight of armour or something like that. Although if we need a ’living’ subject, there is one right in front of me. I doubt Layla will mind once I get the information out of him.’ In the middle of his thoughts, Agent 11 was attempting to move but he barely managed to move the chair. The strings around him resembled a large cocoon, preventing him from any types of movement except for wiggling.

"Who are you? Are you working with that damn traitor?" Agent 11 asked.

Looking at the man, Fex sighed. "Come on, do I really have to explain your current situation to you? It should be obvious which one of us will be the one asking the questions." Looking the Agent dead in the eye, the vampire’s eyes started to glow red. He then pulled out a sheet of paper with the list of questions he needed to ask him.

"How many members of Pure are currently present on this planet?" Fex asked, as he was ready to scribble in an answer.

However, contrary to his belief, the Pure Agent didn’t give him an answer. As Fex looked up, he could see that the other’s eyes didn’t have the typical look of someone under a vampire’s control.

As a member of Pure he had been trained to protect his mind from mental type abilities, which was delaying the Influence skill Fex was using. Still, it felt like it would soon win out and take over him.

’Those red eyes, so he’s one of those V. Is this the mind control that they warned us about? I can’t use my Qi to break out of these strings, but I can still do this.’

Controlling his Qi, Agent 11 was able to use the second stage to form something akin to a barrier around his brain. Then using the first stage, he was able to power up his brain even more, dispelling whatever was trying to force him to answer the question.

When he no longer felt any power inside him, he looked up at Fex and smiled.

"Nice try. Go on, ask me as many questions as you like? I have all the time in the world, buddy."

’What the hell? Nobody told me my Influence skill doesn’t work on those Pure guys! Fex was shocked, shaking his head. ’Shit, I have to do something! What kind of embarrassment would it be, if I can’t even complete such a small task by the time the others come back?’

The vampire pondered what he should do now that his go-to method had failed. He could resort to toruture, but the man in front seemed like the type that wouldn’t respond to it. In the first place, torture ran the risk of only receiving the type of answer the torturer wanted to hear, with no way of verifying it. Under the Influence skill the victim couldn’t lie, which made it the far better choice.

"Did you already run out of questions? How about I help you? Why don’t you ask me some things I would just loooovvvve to share with you?" Agent 11 offered with a self satisfied grin. "You’re with that bitch’s bastard daughter who is just dying to find out more about mommy dearest and since I’m feeling generous let me tell you some things. Now those might just have been rumours about her birth, but if that was all they were, there would have been no reason for Zero to forbid anyone from ever talk-."

The next second, Fex had already wrapped the man’s mouth. He was tired of his cocky nature and he had no desire to listen to him badmouth Layla. The vampire walked up to the bound prisoner, lifted up his hand, and before the Pure member could blink he already felt the sting from the other’s slap. The whole chair fell to the side from the force behind it, and Agent 11’s cheek grazed across the ground.

"You’re so annoying. What the hell do I care about her past?" Fex questioned him, not expecting any answer. "She helped my arse back then, so I’m just trying to help her out as well."

’How strong of a slap was that to have knocked a few of my teeth loose? I was using Qi to protect my body from torture, yet he managed to overwhelm my defense that easily? Damn it! We knew about the Cursed faction coming to reinforce them, but who knew they were this strong? I have to somehow find a way to warn Agent 2 that we have completely underestimated them.’

Standing on the edge, Fex looked down on the busy mass of people. Out of curiosity he placed his hand cupping around his ears to have an easier time hearing what they were saying.

"The Sergeant has told us to get the Mechs ready and to move them to area A where the beasts are located."

"But doesn’t that mean we will have to fight the beasts off, what are they thinking?"

"It’s in case the Demi-god beast decides to change areas and hunt more beasts. The idea is not to kill the beasts but just hold them off with the machines. We just need to wait for the higher-ups to arrive and then make our way out to not get in the way. Alright, I’ll meet you in the hangar and we can get our team ready then." Avion explained.

’What an interesting conversation, so they send Mechs down in the underground tunnels where the others are. Well, there’s not much I can do with that guy, so I might as well make myself useful. Logan should be fine on his own, since he’s just getting information from the Lab.’ Fex reasoned, but there was just one problem he had to deal with. He couldn’t leave the guy up here on his own.

Carrying Agent 11 under his arm, Fex had a goal. He quickly traveled to the hangar, where the Mechs were located. He used his hearing to locate a soldier away from others and quickly found one who was about to board on to a Mech. Fex quickly pulled him down, and activated his Influence skill once more.

"I need you to tell me your name, your rank, pretty much everything so nobody gets suspicious about me piloting your Mech." Fex ordered. Fortunately, there was no problem with his Influence skill this time. After getting the answers he needed, he tied up the soldier and hid him behind a bunch of crates where he wouldn’t be found anytime soon.

"Soldier Kane, why are you slacking behind!" Avion shouted through the Mech’s terminal as the other pilots had already started to leave the hangar.

Quickly jumping in, and throwing Agent 11 in the cockpit cramping him up against the wall, Fex activated the Mech and trotted behind the rest.

’Hehe, this is going to be great.’ Fex thought with the biggest smile on his face.
