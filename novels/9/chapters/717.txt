Chapter 718 An ex leader

Hearing Dwight say his true name, Silver finally understood who he was. At the time, she still wasn't a vampire knight, but she had heard of an upcoming vampire who was rising through the ranks at an incredible rate.

A great talent that everyone knew, and that said person, was Rowa in front of her.

Even when he became leader, he had relinquished that position fast moving on and deciding to become a Royal knight. The thing was about Royal knights, once someone accepted this position, they were expected to stay loyal to the current king and most of the time they would pass on with him.

Those that joined the Royal army would no longer have the opportunity to become king and they knew that. It was a way for them to prove their loyalty to that of the current king. But Rowa had changed all that.

The others were unaware of how Rowa was growing his powers so fast, and eventually without warning, he had one day turned into one of them. Of course, when Rowa had turned into a permanent Bloodsucker, the king had ordered to get rid of him.

There was no reversing back once one had reached this point, so Rowa felt like he had no choice but to run away, holding a grudge against those that he had dedicated his life to.

So what if he enjoyed a sip of blood now and then, the second he turned into a blood sucker, they had forgotten all the sacrifices he had made, they could have at least tried to figure something out, yet they hadn't.

From that day onward, Rowa would take on future Bloodsuckers looking after them. Where they were based or where they were getting their blood from no one knew. But it was a threat that the current king was always worried about.

"Have you finally decided to betray the whole settlement. Are you here to destroy us all?" Dwight asked. "Let me tell you, it won't be easy."

Silver was a little concerned even with Dwight, Jin and Leo. She felt like it wouldn't be enough. When one turned into a bloodsucker their basic stats nearly doubled, and Rowa being a past leader, and being a blood sucker for so long would be far stronger than a regular leader.

"Not today," Rowa said. "I want you guys to crumble in fear, wondering when the next attack will happen. You know nothing about us, how many people we have, how strong our forces are, yet I know everything about the settlement, even this little training session going on today.

"I want you all to worry each day that soon it could be your last. Because that was the same experience I feared when I was turned into this, and locked up, knowing that I would be executed. Death for you all is too light of a punishment." Rowa said, and the next second the large body was gone.

Silver hadn't even seen him leave, but there was nothing infront of her. Even with such a large body he had speed beyond what she could see. CHùíÜCk for ùíèew stùíêries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

"That person was a strong one, I would have liked to see how I would have fared against him." Leo commented.

Jin chuckled a little bit. "I'm more thankful that we didn't actually get in a fight, for a new knight you sure are brave."

"Not brave," Leo said, shaking his head. "I just wish to test my limits, so far I haven't had the opportunity to test how far my current strength can take me. He looked like someone who would have been able to do that."

"Let's look for the students and head back to the castle. I must inform the king about what is happening." Edward said, looking into the distance of where Rowa had left.

The other vampire knights and leaders had safely rescued most of the students, there were very few that had actually died. In total two teachers were found dead along with five other students. Some of the vampire knights had confronted the bloodsuckers, but soon left after seeing them.

Sadly, there seemed to be more deaths on one side rather than the other. It was impossible to keep a secret of what had happened as the students were already talking to each other about it as they made their way back to school.

However, there was one rumour going around. Students had overheard the knights and the other teachers talking. Saying that a couple of bloodsuckers had been killed before they had arrived at one of the locations.

Soon, they had figured out that it was the bloodsucker who had attacked both Nicu's and Rokene's group.

While walking back, Nicu was doing so with the rest of the descendants. He had his head held down and he hadn't said much. He was still in shock of what had happened.

"Hey Nicu, you were in the group that killed one of the bloodsuckers, right? Those things are so powerful and scary. I can't believe you managed to kill one, how did you do it?" One of his friends asked.

"I killed one?" Nicu replied.

"Yeah all the other kids are talking about it. Some of the teachers even died, there's no way that anyone else could have killed one."

"Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but it wasn't me." Nicu replied.

"It wasn't you? Stop joking around, if it wasn't you, then who was it?"

Nicu said nothing, but just looked in the direction of Erin.

'Who are you, how could you be so strong coming from the tenth family? I need to look into some things.'

Some time had passed, and somewhere on the Vampire planet, was a certain special place. Somewhere on the planet in the middle of a forest, there was a large waterfall, gushing water down into the bottom of the lake.

If one was to go through the waterfall, they would notice that there was a large cave, one large enough that housed Rowa and his army. Another society of bloodsuckers lived here calling this place there home.

Inside there were building structures, homes and empty blood packs scattered round the place. Most of the houses were just basic. Although these bloodsuckers did have intelligence, it varied from bloodsucker to bloodsucker. Only a few had the full mental capacity they once had in the past.

Entering the cavern was a hooded man, but he was not one of the blood suckers. He walked passed and a few of the creatures snarled at him, but he continued walking confidently deeper and deeper into the cavern.

Until he had reached the end, where a large mansion could be seen. Two bloodsuckers stood guard, larger than the others.

"He has been expecting you," One of the guards said and the hooded man was let in.

Eventually, he was escorted to a throne room, where sitting in a large giant chair to fit his giant body, was the leader of them all, Rowa.

"Did you bring the goods with you?' Rowa asked.

"Of course, I have left the blood packs at the usual place, but I'm starting to wonder why I even helped you in the first place, when you couldn't even do such a simple task. Why did you attack the children! That was not what I asked!" The hooded man shouted in anger.

"Calm down." Rowa replied calmly. "I need to remind you, that you are on your own here and not in your own establishment. You asked me to get rid of the tenth, and you said it would be an easy task. However, all of my people that attacked are dead, so I decided to improvise.

"I thought maybe we could start right from the bottom, getting rid of the tenth children."

"Well, it looks like you failed at that as well, and instead now the whole vampire council know about you." The hooded man replied.

"It was only a matter of time before they found out about us. Besides it looks like you were keeping something from us, no wonder you want to get rid of the tenth family."

The hooded man didn't reply as he was confused by what Rowa was saying.

"Oh, so you don't know?"

Rowa didn't say anything past that, but before meeting with the hooded man he had found out about the girl. The girl who wielded the strange yellow aura, confirming that she was most likely a dhampir.

She was surely hiding herself, and maybe this was something they could use.

"Don't worry." Rowan said with the biggest grin on his face so far. We will get rid of the tenth family for you. I am more than happy and this time, we will do it right. It will also be a message to the king. That there is a force out there that will soon even topple them."
