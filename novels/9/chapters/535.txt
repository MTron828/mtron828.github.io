Chapter 536 Ticket out of here

The dungeon was known by everyone who had attended a military base. For it was not only used on the students but the military personnel as well. Each place had one, but it wasn‚Äôt clear to everyone what exactly went on down there. They never explained it to students or the others.

However, there were very few people who would come out from the dungeon and when they did, they would do so as a changed person.

Logan had done a lot of research on the dungeon when Peter was down there, and it turned out that most of the rumors were most likely just that, rumors. The reason for people‚Äôs crazy change was because they had their abilities taken away.

Essentially, the dungeons around the military bases were a prison, and they would spend their days waiting there until Truedream came and took their abilities away. Making them a normal person, with no such way to abuse their abilities again.

The group followed Paul to a particular spot in the school. It was where the administration building would be and often where the other teachers would hold their meetings. The good news so far was Paul hadn‚Äôt seen any of his generals or sergeants having been killed.

‚ÄôDid they make it out safely in time?‚Äô He thought.

"It‚Äôs right here." Paul pointed underneath the rubble. The others including himself got to work, doing the heavy lifting. As Paul was doing so, he found the rubble was far lighter than he had imagined in his head.

Of course, he hadn‚Äôt even had time to get used to his new body. Even if Leo had briefed him on everything, there was only so much you could learn from words. So right now he was on a learn as you go basis.

When the rubble was finally cleared, there appeared to be what looked like a large trap door.

"This is definitely the place." Peter said.

Only the trapdoor wasn‚Äôt what it used to be, it too had been completely destroyed. The doors were bent and some rubble from the building was seen inside. Past the trap door there was a descending staircase.

"The lights are on." Layla noticed. "Is someone inside?"

"Maybe they can answer the questions we have." Quinn said, walking forward and taking the charge this time while the rest followed him.

"Paul." Quinn said as he noticed he was still standing at the top. He was still thinking about the whole situation, and honestly, if there were people inside, he didn‚Äôt want to meet them down there. If their abilities had yet to be taken away, they would have a huge grudge against him and the others. For more reasons than one.

"You‚Äôre coming with me, you know this place better than anyone." Quinn said, dragging him to the front.

Walking down the staircase it was the same, they could see bodies lying across the floor, but for the first time. They had also spotted a student uniform.

The students all looked at him, wondering if they could figure out who he was, but not one of them recognized the body, it was hard to with the burn like marks everywhere.

"Maybe he was down here from near the start of the year, or was a second-year student." Logan said.

Once the staircase had ended, they were finally there, in the so-called dungeon. However dungeon was a strange word to use, for the sight they were looking at was pretty impressive and modern looking.

They had entered what could only be described as an underground base. The same materials that were used to build parts of the base outside, were also used inside. The room was large and felt a bit like a square shaped shopping mall. For when they looked up, they could see several floors above them.

Each floor was lined with rooms going across both sides, then at the end of each place, there were doors that looked as if it led to different places.

"It looks like they have enough doors here to keep the whole school under here." Fex said. "Why make so many?"

The group started walking with Paul leading the way, and he was telling the idea behind it.

"It was designed that way. When Pure came about, we started realizing that different people had different ideals. The military was afraid that these ideals were able to convince a whole group to go rogue. So they made us build a room for each student that was present at the school."

"There is also a separate one, underneath the city as well, for each of the military personnel."

"You‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs bad for people to have different ideals?" Quinn asked. "It‚Äôs your way, or you get locked up."

"When war is upon us, it‚Äôs important that everyone has the same goal. We have to be fighting the enemy, not each other." Paul replied sternly. It was as if he was trying to convince himself that what he had done was right so far.

They continued to walk, and inside the room, there were now several bodies. It was a mixture of both guards and students. The doors to the rooms were open, and some had been broken open. Still, they hadn‚Äôt found a single person alive yet.

However, there was a key difference to the people inside the dungeon and those outside. These bodies inside had different wounds. Yes, they were scorched, but they also had puncture wounds, some had missing limbs. As if they had gotten into two separate fights with two different ability users.

Vorden was looking at it all carefully inspecting the bodies longer than anyone else, and he had his finger on his chin as if he was thinking hard about something.

"Tell me, what do you think happened here?" Paul asked out of curiosity.

When looking at the bodies, Vorden who was well experienced in different abilities came up with his own theory. It was only a thought and there was no way of confirming it without asking someone, but he thought there was no harm in telling the others.

"If we look at the bodies outside they were all scorched, the ones in here are the same but slightly different. It‚Äôs like they were in a battle beforehand. It was clear that this was done with an ability and there had to be more than one person to pull off something like this, which meant they all had the same ability."

"It looked as if a group of people had come to take out the soldiers on the outside, while there was some fighting going on inside the dungeon. Then when the intruders from outside came inside, they used their abilities on every soldier to make sure they were dead."

"There aren‚Äôt many people that have the strength to take on the military. Even if it‚Äôs just one base like this. If I was to take a guess, it would either be the fire ability from the big four, or the lightning ability from the big four. It could be another faction with a power similar to theirs, but I can‚Äôt imagine anyone else pulling off something like this."

When Vorden said those last words, he had slightly bitten his bottom lip, for he had lied slightly. There was one more family that would be able to pull this off as well. It was his own family.

"It looks like me and you are thinking along the same lines." Paul said. He could tell Vorden was a very observant person, the most out of all of them.

"But why would the big four suddenly attack?" Layla asked. "I mean, I understand if the big families got together, but if what Vorden says is true, this was the work of one family. Why now of all times?"

"That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to find out." Quinn said.

The group continued to walk, and now they were out of the main area. There were no longer any cells for the prisoners and instead just rooms with different objects inside them. Some had restraining chairs and tables with chains on them.

Others looked like rooms filled with different types of games. Seeing all this, Layla wasn‚Äôt liking it at all. It was reminding her a lot of her time at Pure. They too did similar things.

"What is all this?" Fex asked.

"Before I say anymore, I feel like whatever I say I will turn out to be the bad guy." Paul replied. "I‚Äôm no saint, I know that, and I have already explained many times my reasoning for doing so. I just want to remind you all I am on your side now."

"I wish to save my people, and figure out what is happening here. Everything that has happened has already happened and was approved by several people, not just me."

These words were mostly directed at Quinn, now that Paul was a vampire, seeing all this stuff he could hear Quinn‚Äôs heartbeat getting louder as he was getting more frustrated.

"This is a testing room." Paul said. "Often there are new technologies, or new medical procedures. For the criminals that commit the biggest crimes, they are to be used here."

It was a good thing Paul had said what he had said before, because if he hadn‚Äôt Quinn would have had another outburst, but it was pointless just to waste his breath. It was the fact that things wasn‚Äôt fair. Crimes would‚Äôt be treated fairly. He was sure those with stronger abilities were free to get away with more things then others.

While those low levels, might just be put in these types of places anyway. Saying that there was no better use for them. They couldn‚Äôt fight so they might as well be used to help against the war.

It rubbed Quinn the wrong way because if he had never gotten his ability he would have been one of these people as well, as well as Peter.

"The reason we are down here though, is because the experimentation wasn‚Äôt just on people, but on new technologies and such being developed." Paul said.

That‚Äôs when they noticed, so far, this part of the facility had remained untouched. They were going through several doors, and each time a passcode was required to be entered. By the sound and the way Paul‚Äôs finger was moving it was a different one each time as well.

With each room they entered it was filled side by side with different things, and then finally they had entered the room they were looking for.

"Whoah!!!" Fex said. "Now that‚Äôs cool."

"This is our ticket out of here." Paul said.

They had entered some type of hanger, and in front of them, was a large spaceship.
