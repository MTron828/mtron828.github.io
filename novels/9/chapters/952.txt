Chapter 953 - Planet Earth

Flying through space was a medium-sized oval spaceship. It had a clear front allowing one to look at everything outside. It was a vehicle designed to fit around fifteen or so people, one of the many aircraft onboard the Cursed spaceship.

Currently inside were all the members that were preparing to head back to earth and arrive at their new destination. On top of this, Sam had come along for now but would be returning after dropping the others off. A small brief was being given by him to everyone, and at the same time, they were making their final preparations.

Peter had formed his soul weapon in his hand, and Sil stood opposite him with his eyes closed and his body slightly shaking.

"What the hell are you scared of?" Peter asked. "The mask doesn’t hurt."

"I know, but you’re going to shove it onto my face. Anyone would feel uncomfortable about that. Why can’t I just copy your ability?" Sil asked.

"Well, unless you want to come to see me every twenty-four hours, then I wouldn’t recommend it. It wouldn’t work anyway. Is there anyone you want him to look like, or am I free to choose?" Peter asked while looking over at Sam.

"Just don’t make him stand out too much, and don’t turn him into a girl. That would be a little uncomfortable." Sam said.

Before Sil could even get ready, the mask was shoved onto his face. Sil attempted to grab his hands, but when they connected he realised that for some reason, he couldn’t copy Peter’s ability. He didn’t pay much attention in the past when Vorden was in control, but now he knew there wasn’t much he could do. However, as his body started to morph, he realised the whole process was painless and let go. Once everything was complete, he took a step back, touching his face.

"Do I look different?" Sil asked.

The sound of a slap was heard, and when they turned around, they could see it was Sam. His forehead was bright red. He had slapped his head too many times recently. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

"Didn’t I say not to make him stand out?" Sam said.

"What? I just made him into a good looking chap. We want him to learn as many abilities as he can, right?" Peter said.

Essentially, there weren’t any massive changes that had been done to Sil’s body. He was still a tall good looking young lad. His facial features differed slightly, changing the shape of his eyes and nose, but his hair remained the same, apart from a change in colour from blonde to a light brown.

With Sil’s looks, he usually gathered attention anyway, and Peter didn’t want to go to the effort of changing him much. It was nearly impossible for him to come up with an entirely new appearance, he had to base it off others and he did so thinking of some of the people he had seen on the Blade island.

"So, are you and Borden really not going to be with me?" Sil asked, looking at Quinn. He looked down with his shoulders slumped as if he was sulking.

"No, but remember I will be a teacher at the school so you can come to see me at any time. But honestly, I want you to talk to others and get used to it. It’s what Vorden and Raten would have wanted. Remember, Borden is busy teaching all the Blade children you saved from the island. Think of it this way, the more people you meet, the more chances we have of bringing Sil and Raten back.

"Besides, Chucky will be with you most of the time. He’s a member of the Cursed faction, so if it ever gets too much, just talk to him, and he will come over to us." Quinn answered.

When Sil turned to look at Chucky, he smiled back at him, but Sil instead just stomped the ground and walked away as if he was disappointed by Quinn’s answer.

’Why are they putting so much attention on this person that is acting like a child?’ Chucky thought. Not really knowing who Sil was. Only that he would regularly be invited to be at the table of the Cursed leaders.

Only those in higher positions had seen what Sil could do. Fortunately, the Broadcast also didn’t show much either, apart from the world leaders not wanting Sil to participate in the duel.

"Okay, looks like we are nearly there," Sam said, looking at the map. He turned around to face the others. "Now remember, Quinn. You will not be known as Quinn when you arrive, but instead, you will now be known as Hardy."

Hearing the name and alias Sam had given him, he was glad that Logan wasn’t the one coming up with them. Otherwise, he would have been stuck with the name Buinn.

"Remind me why I’m the only one using an alias?" Quinn asked.

"Because you’re one of the world leaders, you have to know your position now. Even the other Head Generals need to treat you with respect, and that’s not what we want. Everyone is on their best behaviour when they know they are being watched by the higher-ups. What we need is to find out the truth. They will just treat you differently if they know who you are.

"Everyone will think you are just a high ranking member from the Cursed faction having taken this position. The only one that knows who you really are is Owen and Oscar. Although Owen won’t be there, only those he has sent."

"And you’re sure they won’t recognise me?" Quinn asked, attempting to look at himself, but just looking at his hands and legs, he felt hardly any difference at all.

"Quinn, I remember when I first saw you. Your appearance from back then, and the appearance you have now, are completely different. No one would believe the weak little nerd and the person standing in front of me, is the same person."

"He’s right about that," Helen commented, who had been sitting down staring out the window the whole time. "I’ve seen the photos, and the boy from before would get a four at best. While the hunk in front of me would be getting a ten out of ten. Although, you did have your own charms back then."

"Wow!" Fex said, looking at Quinn. "I thought I was the playboy of the group and not shy to speak my mouth, but it looks like I got some competition. Hey, I forgot to ask but, if Peter and Helen are going to be head generals, then what about me?"

"You," Sam said. "Um, well you see, they have this class called arts and crafts, and I thought your ability really suited it, so I requested for you to be an arts and crafts teacher at the school. You know people need their hobbies as well."

"Arts and crafts?" Fex replied, his excitement quickly dwindling as he imagined a bunch of grandmas sitting around, knitting.

"Remember they’re students, not grandmas," Sam replied as if he could see what he was thinking. At times he thought he was dealing with a Nate 2.0. The only difference was, Fex could get the girls he was interested in. "So, are you ready, Hardy?" Sam asked.

"Yes, Head General Hardy is ready," Quinn said.

Looking out of the glass window, they could see countless sh.i.p.s leaving and flying through space as they all got closer to one area in particular, and that area was none other than earth. Even after all the planets they had discovered through the beast solar system, there wasn’t one quite like earth.

With its blue water, clear skies and green landmass. Earth was a unique place, and seeing it like this, from a distance, he understood why humans fought so hard to keep this place.

"I guess we’re finally going home," Quinn said.

As they entered the earth’s atmosphere, the ship started to follow the flight path of the coordinates given. It flew over the blue sea, and the crashing waves could be seen, and finally, out in the distance, there was land.

On top of that land, a large school-like sculpture was seen. It was an incredible masterpiece that could be seen from afar. In the centre of all the square buildings, it had two titled large altars with a levitating circle ball in the middle.

Sh.i.p.s seemed to be lined up waiting to enter the island as strict border control was being implemented.

"It’s impressive. I’m sure the military has some defensive measures as well, just in case the Dalki chose to attack. They wouldn’t prepare all this for no reason." Sam said.

"Sure," Quinn replied, but he knew it wasn’t a question of if. It was when. What Quinn didn’t know was some extra forces would be working with the Dalki.
