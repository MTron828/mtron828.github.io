Chapter 1232 Alien VS Predator

The drones being used to livestream the fight between the 'strongest human' and one of the Dalki leaders weren't ordinary. In fact, both Bonny and Void had invested their life savings into purchasing these robots. The two of them had started together from the bottom. They used to be no names in the entertainment industry and rather than going through the traditional means, they had decided to build themselves from the ground up by starting their own channel and news outlet.

It was only later they had been picked up and given a dedicated live channel that could be broadcasted on world channels as well. Through the years they had learned a lot, and over the years had continued to reinvest their earnings into their equipment, making their reporting game above anyone else. Besides they were after all, one of the few daring enough to put themselves in dangerous situations.

Each one of Void's drones might have cost an arm and a leg, but they were literally the best money could buy, able to survive through thunderstorms and more. Nevertheless, it didn't mean they were indestructible, nothing in the world was, but they could take quite the beating under normal circumstances.

Of course, any one attack from Slicer or Hilston would be more than enough to take them out, but thankfully Void's control over them was superb. He moved them as if they were extensions of his own body, allowing him to get them in the right places to offer the best viewing experience while simultaneously keeping them out of the danger zone. His concentration was always in top shape, it helped due to how much these drones cost in the first place.

So far, the drones had survived all the chaos, taking the whole world along for the ride. Filming every aspect of the fight since the Cursed ship.

"Did you see the powers that Blade person used? Teleportation, Fire and Lightning! Each one of them was top tier!"

"Top tier? Have we been watching the same fight? That was far beyond the top tier! Why would a person this strong stay hidden this whole time? With his power he could have had anything he wanted!"

"I know they are saying he's done bad things, but does it really matter at this moment. We need everyone we can to fight against the Dalki."

Those online were fascinated by the strong powers displayed by Hilston Blade and despite Bonny revealing the Blade family's negative past, the support of the people was with him. In a way, it was natural when seeing a human fight against a Dalki that the public would be on his side.

Out of the two, Slicer was the first to make her next move, by dashing forward again. To the viewers it appeared as if she was simply repeating the same pattern over and over. One would think that she hadn't learned her lesson, but as her opponent, Hilston could feel the difference. Each time, one of them was able to catch a break. The fighting positions of them both reset to how they first started. Despite the moves being the same, Slicer came at him slightly stronger each time.

This time, Hilston did something different hoping to change the outcome. He moved his hand and the next second a giant wave of sand could be seen swallowing Slicer whole, but just like everything else so far, the Dalki leader used her tail to cut through the obstacle to reach her target.

However, following after the sand was part of the ship that was being hurled at her again and again. Large and small pieces of all shapes and sizes, They wern;t being thrown one by one either. Multiple parts were moving in all sorts of different directions. She was able to avoid or take most of the blows head on. Some of the times would simply bounce off her hard skin, but for a second, she could feel that her tail had slowed down.

'What is this strange force I can feel. Is it an ability? For me to actually feel a difference...' Slicer was quite surprised.

Pushing through with her strength she could move her tail still, the Dalki cut another wave of sand, only to find a piece of metal from the ship hitting her with great force, more so than all the items before, and lifting her into the air.

'It's best not to show your entire strength.' Hilston thought with a smile, pleased how his simple plan had worked out.

Whenever, Hilston got the chance, he would rain down lightning on the Dalki like he was doing now in the air, but for the first time it looked as if this ability was completely ineffective.

'I knew it, this person still has tricks up his sleeve! Yes, this is what I was waiting for!' Slicer thought, a pleased distorted smile on her face. 'The lightning attacks hardly harm my body anymore, but they must be draining his energy.'

Not many people had fought against a five spike Dalki or had lived to get up close to one and speak again.So they had no way of knowing that five spikes were a little different. Their bodies would be altered slightly. The scales on their outer body tripled in thickness and strength, making most attacks feel like nothing, which was why the lightning wasn't affecting Slicer in the same way it would have done others.

"That ability he just used, that had to have been Telekinesis, right? That would make it the fourth ability he has used so far!" Someone commented on the livestream.

In the air, Slicer soon slashed the metal object that was propelling her into the air. She had split it up into several parts, but didn't expect for now all the separate pieces to be going towards her. Moving her tail even faster she continued to cut them into smaller and smaller pieces until they were no longer moving. Now mid air, she started to fall, until from her back, large wings sprouted. Wings were already a rarity among the Dalki, yet Slicer was even more unique in that she was able to retract them at will.

For the first time, the female Dalki changed her tactics. Rather than attacking Hilston by running straight forward from the ground, she was making use of her wings and flew at him at a speed faster than her previous top one.

"Come on, most of your attacks still haven't been able to even hurt me that bad!" Slicer taunted her opponent. Hilston knew that she wasn't lying. So far, the only thing that had been effective, had been the fire ability mixed in with his natural raw strength supported from the demon tier armour.

Unfortunately, getting a hold of her had proven to be a real headache. Planting his first into the lizard's body would be a hard task. Given how fast Slicer currently was, it was incredibly hard for the strongest human to physically hit her. Fortunately, the lightning attacks moved at speed surpassing hers, just like the telekinesis ability which was why Hilston didn't show any signs of panic. Still these were ineffective which was why he was at a standstill.

When Slicer was close enough, around an arm's reach away, a large pulse radiated from his armour. The force itself could be seen as a ripple moving through the sky. It didn't move fast, nor did it spread out too wide, but for those inside its range, it was impossible to escape the attack.

Just like everything Slicer had seen before, she attempted to slash through this invisible pulse. When the tip of her tail touched it, an instinct surfaced which she hadn't felt in a long time.

'This, it was exactly the same skill he had used when I had him held up in the air.' She thought.

When it passed through her whole body, there was nothing she could do. Her body became unable to move and the female Dalki was falling down. However, whilst in mid-air Hilston followed up with a double hammer fist of flames, slamming her into the ground making a tide of sand shoot up into the sky. Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

The livestream that was being shown to the viewers played out a frame rate that was usually used to film slow motion videos. Otherwise, many wouldn't be able to fathom what was going on, and would be unable to see such a lightning fast fight in real life, but they could all see it through the screen. It was unbelievable everything they were seeing at the event was nail biting for them all.

They were unsure just what was going to happen next or how it would all play out.
