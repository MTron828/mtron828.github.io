As usual Quinn was being transported using Mundus' powers via the strange white light of energy and he had no idea what to expect. The only thing he did know was that it would be his last and final opponent.

After this, he would finally have the crystals that were needed so he could create the armour that would hopefully put him at a level where if he went up against anyone he would have no problem at all, and that included Ray, as well as future opponents as well.

'After each enemy I've faced it seems like the next one has been harder.' Quinn thought. 'No, that's not quite right, they have all had their fair share of difficulties to deal with.

'The Monkey man was tricky, and held a powerful weapon. In the end, I was only able to beat him perhaps because I had more tricks up my own sleeve than he did and that he didn't know about. My versatility won out in the end on that one, having to use my soul weapon.

'With the Phoenix, for the first time, my body reacted to my natural weakness, being that of a vampire. If I didn't figure out how it was healing itself, then that would have been a close call as well.

'Then there was that, what did he call himself, the Dark Magus. Looking back, I'm happy that the situation ended up ending the way it did. Things could have taken a turn for the worse, and even though I didn't fight him, based on what he was able to do Mundus, it might have been a fight I completely lost.

'Lastly, there was the Behemoth. A beast so large and grand in power that none of my attacks did anything, and in the end I had to use the Demon form, which I'm still none the wiser in terms of how it works.'

Based on all of his past opponents, the god slayers had been a mix of races, and beasts. Which one was easier or harder it was hard to tell, but when fighting a beast he had less of a conscience due to not being able to speak to them.

The teleportation was over, and usually based on the planet they were on, Quinn would have an idea of what opponent they would go against, and see what he had to work with when fighting.

Whether he had to be careful or not of hurting others, like he did when going against the Monkey man. Yet here, had to be the strangest place he had been brought to by far.Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

"Are you sure we are in the right place?" Quinn asked.

"Do you really think I would make a mistake?" Mundus replied.

Right now, Quinn didn't even feel like he was in the universe or in somewhere that was space, because the place looked entirely different. The area around them wasn't black but instead was a mystic mix of colours.

The only time he had seen a place somewhat like this was when he had gone to the Familiar world, but based on the energy he could tell it wasn't the Familiar world, and there were quite a few other giveaways that he noticed that told him that as well.

Currently both him and Mundus were on what looked like a large piece of land. It wasn't circular like a planet, but was just slowly floating in the colourful air. It had pieces of grass growing on it, but there was nothing else.

When looking around in the new space around him, there were several pieces of floating bits of land in the air. All of them with different things. Some had some water on them, others had trees growing, and there was even the odd one with a few bugs on it here and there.

Yet, from what he could see while looking around, there were no planets next to them. No large circular lands off in the distance, nor was there a sun or heat source, yet it wasn't cold.

Instead there were just multiple large pieces of land floating, with different things on each one of them.

"Through the opponents you have faced, you have learned a bit of history about the celestials. About what had happened to us before our time." Mundus explained. "Of course, there is always a reason why we leave god slayers alone, so there is always a history behind the god slayers.

"With this one, it is the same, but is perhaps the most complicated out of all of them so far. Because, there was once a time where the celestials were heavily involved in the lives that he looked over.

"We didn't always attempt to do things behind the scenes and take a back seat, but it is perhaps because of this incident that we now do things the way we do them.please visit

"Once, there was a race known as the Asuras. There were deviations of the race, but to make it more simple I will explain that they were one race. Beings that had such great power, that were so strong, one could almost call them a race of god slayers, because nearly every one of them had the power to match up to us.

"However, their great strength as well as strong personalities is what caused a divide between them in the end. Among the Asuras there were those that thought they needed to do everything they could to serve the celestials that helped them.

"While others felt like they were prisoners, and wished to break free. In the end, this started a war among the celestials and the Asuras, with some of the Asuras joining our side."

Listening to the story, Quinn was reminded a bit of the vampires, because it was the same with them as well. At the same time, it reminded him of the current situation. With the Dalki returning, and a large amount of time passing, there were those that would get more spikes as time went on.

Maybe, Mundus was asking Quinn to deal with the situation not just because there were many god slayers, but because they had already seen what had happened before, and didn't wish for another repeat of it to happen.

"This area that you are in now, this part of the Universe that you can see. It used to be filled with planets, just like your planet. It looked normal, however this is all that is left now. This is the result of the great war that had happened back then.

"Several planets destroyed, space itself broken down and in a healing stage. The god slayer is a survivor of the war. He is an Asura, one who felt like they were prisoners, but when they realised that due to their actions they had lost everything, they had decided to stay here.

"To stay in the middle of the destruction that they had caused. For us, the celestials there were no more lives for us to look after anymore, and since the Asura has stayed here. This being, in a true sense of the word, is where the word god slayer was created.

"In the battle, he had eliminated many god slayers, and in his strength he had destroyed many of the planets here. Although before there were many, now there is only one, which is why we gave him the name, Asura, the first god slayer."

A being that had been here from the beginning, one that had a past that sounded similar to Quinn's. In fact, many of the god slayers seemed to have a tale similar to Quinn's, but through the story no matter what, it seemed like the celestials always won.

In the end, this god slayer's power, everything he had done was in vain, and they had ended up like this.

As the floating pieces of land moved, off in the distance Quinn could see a human shape sitting down. He was red skinned, sitting crossed legged, with two arms and looked to be in a meditating position.

'This... is my last opponent.'
