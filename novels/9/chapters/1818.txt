Chapter 1819: Act like one. (Part 1)

Section three of the ship was one of the most significant sections and was one of the few zones from which one could head to any area because it was at the centre of the whole spaceship.

It was also where most of the different races would gather as they relaxed, socialised with each other, and made connections. Meaning it had the most number of people that were on board in one place, and that included Quinn, who was at one of the bars.

After everyone heard the announcement that the ship was under attack, the two sisters stood up from their seats. They were concerned as sweat trickled down the side of their faces.

"What should we do, sis? Do you think this is because of us?" The blue-haired young woman asked. Her voice trembled as she spoke, and she felt words get stuck in her throat due to the fear.

"Don't worry, Ceril." Wince replied.

"The pirates frequently attack this ship. The staff here are some of the strongest in the galaxy."

"At the same time, there are people from all over, many of them were more important personnel than us, so it's highly unlikely the enemy is here for us."

"This is probably one of the safest places we could be right now."

"Besides, we have a backup plan," Wince turned around, but she soon found herself slapping her head, seeing Quinn lying flat on the table, snoring away. He had fallen asleep somehow, even with all the rumbling.

As Wince went over to wake him up, the whole ship started to shake violently again, and an explosion was heard from one of the areas within section three. It was so powerful that everyone in the bar stumbled on their feet.

A large amount of smoke was coming from the casino area of the ship. The attackers had created a hole which reached five levels. Storming through that hole were around two hundred troops of men, all holding either Lazer guns of some sort or swords made of pure energy.

And leading all of them was what one could only assume as their leader. He was the only one with a different weapon in his hands. The weapon was a golden-blue trident.

At the same time, unlike the others, he wasn't wearing a mask, and everyone had a clear view of his face. His hair was tangled up and dangling down to his shoulders, and he had a muscular face with a few visibly shining scales over his cheekbones.

"Kill them all!" The man hollered and stomped his trident onto the floor, creating a small whirlpool around him. It was the signal for chaos to commence throughout the ship.

Immediately, the guards behind him started to fire their laser guns at everyone with no specific target. They hit the guests, and the staff, whoever came within the line of fire, was getting mauled down. Some of the staff members had also started to move, and there were around twenty in the room alone.

One of the staff swung his arm out, and it started to transform mid-way into a large hammer, hitting the enemy guards in the special suits. It looked like it would be a one-sided match, but those in the suits were able to use their strength to counter it as they barraged against the attack.

Then drawing out their weapons, they started to hack and slash at the hammer. Seeing this, it was clear to everyone that this was no normal pirate attack. The enemies were quickly taking out the powerful cruise staff.

It didn't take long for the guests to understand that they would also need to participate if they wanted to survive. So a full-scale battle began inside the cruise ship, and some of the customers fared better than the workers.

Tom, the huge fat fish from before, used his giant tongue to bind one of the attackers up and gobble him up. The enemy remained in his mouth for a while before his belly expanded, and he spat the armoured foe with great force. Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

Tom spat the attacker into another one of his own and continued to attack. At the same time, the infiltrators were starting to spread out. They cut or sliced the guests until the latter could no longer move. Even the customers who weren't fighting and had surrendered were shot in their legs, so they could not move.

One of the guests was being chased through the casino slot machine area. He ducked and weaved between the machines as they got hit by the incoming stage and exploded, causing hundreds of coins to drop onto the ground.

And just as the guest passed through the machines, he found an enemy guard waiting for him on the other side. Seeing the mask, the man lost all the courage in his head and, with no other way to escape, fell to his knees, clasped both hands together and started to beg.

"Please, I beg you. I have money! I can give you lots of money! Spare me and come back to my planet. I can make it worth your while!" The man said.

Not caring about what the guests had to say, the enemy guard swung the sword, ready to kill or hurt him like the rest, but just before it could reach him, a hand grabbed the blade.

"This is the Marpo-Cruise, and we will protect those on board!" The person was none other than Nog. He held onto the energy blade with his bare hand. It pierced through his skin as his hand around the blade turned red, and blood began to drip out, but the good news was he had managed to stop the attack.

"This is just like a normal sword!" Nog grunted and snapped it in half before punching the attacker in the chest, sending him right into the ship's wall to another section.

"We have protected this ship for decades, and we will also protect the ship today!" Nog proclaimed as he went on to help and deal with the rest.

The staff was putting up a good fight even though they were heavily outnumbered. And things got even more challenging when the attackers decided to spread out a bit. When paying close attention, it looked as if they were checking on each person they attacked since not all of them were being outright killed on the spot.

However, despite the defence they were putting up, they were slowly losing out. Some of the attackers with guns were on the second floor, and one of the staff members was fighting three with blades and was doing quite well with his flexible limbs.

Suddenly, they stopped attacking and jumped out of the way, and in the next instant, a rain of bullets came down on the staff member. Even though it wouldn't go through his body, it drew blood, making him weaker when he was already tired, and eventually, he fell face first on the floor.

The same happened with even the best guards and fighters. The enemies shot at Tom's giant tongue so many times that his mouth would fill up with blood as soon as he retracted it, and eventually, even he collapsed with his tongue rolled out onto the floor.

"These guys... show no respect." He muttered.

Nog seeing all of this, was shaking. Back up had yet to arrive from the other areas. Even though he had sent out a message to them before joining the fight, which meant this was a much larger scale attack than he thought.

He knew the enemies weren't pirates, and in fact, it was almost as if someone had sent out somewhat of a whole army to get them.

"If I can't get in contact with the captain, I'll need to get in contact with the Marpo Base. They'll get rid of these guys if they hear of this!" Nog thought as he took a step forward but suddenly heard the cries and screams. If he wasted time heading to the control room, more lives would be lost.

"I must keep fighting and hope the captain makes it in time to teach all these guys a lesson!"
