Chapter 2510 ¬†Battle of the Wolves

An important battle was set to take place, between Chris and Unzoku, more important than either of them realised. The blood was needed of one of the last two demon kings and a large-scale battle was already taking place between two titans.

"This fight, it won't be the same as last time." Chris declared. He swung his two claws creating large cuts across the ground. It ripped apart and destroyed anything in its path.

Some of the werewolves had dived out of the way, while others hadn't gotten away in time with their legs cut, slashed by the visible energy. A clean cut would be made and their wounds were removing the limbs almost completely from their body.

As the attacks came, Unzoku swung both of his hands, hitting and dispersing the energy, turning them into nothing but particles, but his hand had hovered in the air for a few moments as the strength he felt had stopped.

Immediately reacting, Unzoku aimed his hand at Chris, and out from his hand, several large nails shot out like bullets.

Using his speed, Chris had managed to transform into his wolf form, and zig zagged. The nails crashed into the ground, erupting a large part of the ground underneath it. The nail attacks were fast, but not as fast as Chris.

When he was close, he leapt up in his werewolf form, but as if he had predicted his attack, Unzoku hit him directly with his large claw and sent him right back into the ground crashing.

With next to no time, Chris was on the move out from the small crater that had been made and was circling around Unzoku.

'He managed to recover that fast from a direct hit from me?' Unzoku thought. 'Is this the power gained, the power from eating another demon king?'

Dribble was pouring out of Unzoku's mouth onto the ground. He was getting tempted from his deep thoughts, and the thoughts of what it would be like to consume Chris as well.

Leaping toward Unzoku again, Chris pushed off and had transformed from his wolf to his werewolf form, while the colour of his fur was changing to that of a dark red. He had gotten used to the new power and strength of his body, it was time to level it up a notch further.

However, his current red werewolf form looked different compared to before. This was the first case where this would happen, as usually it would only change the colour and not affect the appearance.

The fur towards the back of his head at the top had overgrown and was running thick on his back, right down to the bottom of his body, where a large tail had appeared as well.

Unzoku was already mid swing with both of his arms, he wasn't holding back with his strikes. He wanted to get rid of Chris, he couldn't wait to consume him, but he was underestimating his new found power.

A large Qi platform had been created in the air, and with both of Chris' legs and his new form he pushed off, when he did he spun his body with both of his claws held out. He was spinning like a rocket.

His body had clashed right into Unzoku's claws and had pushed them back. His arms swung backward from the large scale of the power. The demon king's feet had even been pushed and sunken into the ground for a moment and a physical look of concern could be seen on his face.

Yet, Chris didn't stop there. Creating another Qi platform he aimed for one of the arms. Chris had to focus, he had to pay attention to a smaller part of Unzoku's body. Just like he had done with the Yak.

'I can't be in a rush to take out these demon kings, they are extremely powerful, but I can chip away at everything they have, and continue to fight until I completely take them down!'

Chris was creating small Qi platforms and was hopping with his feet from side to side, while he would swipe away with his claws, attacking at whatever part of Unzoku's body he could see.

It was the same pattern as before as Chris flew from side to side, only it was all focused on Unzoku's arm.

When he was done, he pushed away with another Qi platform going right past Unzoku, and turning into his wolf form to get away as quickly as he could.

'My switching between forms to utilise nearly all of my powers has come in handy.'

Chris turned his head to look at the situation behind him. To see what had occurred, he could see a bloody forearm of Unzoku, his blood dripping onto the floor. Several large cuts had been made., and his arm was throbbing.

The demon king's arm, due to being a werewolf, would often heal everything straight away, but just like with the vampires, this was a different attack that was quite difficult for these beings to handle. It was an attack that had been imbedded with Qi energy. F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Although the wounds would eventually heal, this was the start. Chris could see it, it was the start of taking down those that were impossible, a large confidence was brewing in him.

"You're fast, you are really fast, I almost couldn't keep up with you." Unzoku said. "Your speed gives you great power, but you need to build it up. You might actually be faster than me, but I am still greatly stronger than you."

A battle of speed versus strength and which one was more superior. Werewolves were always beings that had a great amount of physical power as well.

With his sharp ears, Chris was able to sense that something was coming up from behind him. He had no clue what it was, his body was just telling him to move away. As he rushed to the side he could see a large whirlwind of blue power hitting the ground.

It destroyed everything on the floor creating a large black patch in its place. After moving away from the area for quite a bit, swooping down, to join Unzoku's side, was a winged demon, and was none other than Tenbris.

It was one of the other right hand men of Immortui, and another one of the two demon kings.

'Crap, when I just thought I saw a chance of getting through this, another demon king had to join in the fight. I'm not too sure if this one will be as easy to take out as the other demon king either.' Chris thought.

At a time like this, he was actually hoping that just maybe, Edvard would be here to help him, but he was all on his own.

"It looks like you're having a little trouble taking on these invaders." Tenbris claimed. "Anyway, we need to deal with this situation quickly, and deal with the rest of the Divine beings, can't you feel it. Immortui, he's fighting, it's only a matter of time, before we go to the other side."
