Chapter 1226 Broadcasted to everyone

Bonny and Void's live stream was considered popular around the world. However, In recent times their popularity only grew more. As fewer and fewer people were able or willing to broadcast during tough times.

Focusing on current events and asking questions the people wanted to hear, going to places to find the information people wanted to hear. These were all elements that made them popular. The bulk of viewers would be the non-fighters and those not on the front lines. What they didn't expect was that right now, more people than ever were watching their broadcast.

It wasn't just those civilians at home who were watching what was going on. The fight between Hilston Blade and the five spiked Dalki had more viewers than ever. They were people who had never heard of the Blade family before, yet now were able to witness their great power. On top of that, Bonny accurately gave the viewers everything they knew about the Blade family. The source of her information was none other than Logan.

One of the people that hadn't left the Ship despite everything that was going on, was Logan. He could tell if anyone was to come his way. On top of that, he had the power to still control the Ship and control it in ways that would make it difficult for them to reach his position. As he expected anyway, not a single person had decided to stay on the Ship or come after him.

During this time, Logan kept an eye on the stream, and he also found it amazing how many people were currently watching.

'It's not just those on Earth? It looks like it's those on the Shelters as well that are watching what's happening. How are they able to deal with the Dalki attack going on?' Logan thought.

Despite this, he had decided to inform the public about Hilston Blade and the Chained. Hilston was too big of a threat to leave untouched like they had done so far. If after this, he was able to roam around free again without people knowing how much of a dangerous person he was, it would be bad not just for the Cursed faction but the whole of humanity.

All of the information he was giving was putting the Blade family in a bad light by Bonny, however despite all of this. People couldn't keep their eyes off him as they saw his sheer power being used against the five spikes.

What Logan didn't know was that he was somewhat right about the Dalki currently not fighting against the others on the planet at the moment. This was because they were now watching the live stream and looking at the fight between the two.

In the temporary base they had built on each of the planets, they were watching one of their great leaders fight it out. What the Dalki were building on each of the planets was what the humans had come to refer to as a Dalki fortress.

These were small camps, where they would have strange walls made from the black material, in a similar shape to a wall made of logs. They would then have several towers on the outside larger than the wall. Although they were made very quickly, they were just as sturdy as the Shelters the humans made.

This was mainly due to the black material that was used that seemed to be as hard as Glathriuem but nowhere near as hard to obtain. At least that's what the humans thought.

In one of the fortresses, a dome-shaped arena had been built in the middle. The Dalki liked dark places, so they tended to make areas that would allow for little light to enter. They weren't affected by light in any way. Fighting wise or health wise, it just didn't feel natural to them.

Perhaps it had something to do with the planet that they were born on or something to do with the nature of the beast they were made from, but no one truly knew why. Here was where One horn was currently at.

He wasn't alone, as the other Dalki from the main mothership were inside as well. All of them were watching the projection that was being played on the wall. Large enough for them all to see.

They were cheering at the screen every time Slicer would get a good hit in or a cut. What would be surprising to any human to see this, was they were doing the same every time Hilston would land a big blow as well. Upstodatee from n(0)/vùíÜ/lbIn/.(co/m

"I'm surprised the humans had someone that could push Slicer this far. How do you think you would have fared?" A Dalki asked who had one missing eye. Because of this, the others often referred to him as Clops, a three spiked Dalki that had recently obtained his fourth spike.

"Have you been listening to the video? From the sound of it, this is one of the strongest humans in the world. Someone that was left off the radar that even we don't know about. The strong point of Slicer is that tail of hers, but the armour he is wearing seems to be giving her trouble. If it was me, I would smash that armour with my fist." One Horn said, making a fist.

Some of the others started to laugh, but as soon as One Horn looked their way, they quickly shut up. It wasn't usual for the Dalki to be scared of others. Even if they did have more spikes, it just wasn't in their nature, but One Horn had a more aggressive nature compared to the others.

"Leave them be. They know Slicer's strength because she has displayed it to everyone numerous times. Although she was someone who had evolved into a five spike before you, you are both a five spike now." Clops said, trying to calm him down and cheer him up. "We don't know who would win a fight between the three of you. It's not like the past where you would all have a go at each other."

The words certainly did put a smile on One Horn's face because it was true. One Horn had caught up to the two that used to be above him in strength. In the past, the Dalki would constantly fight each other over the leadership seat, and this was how One Horn had grown to the top.

But even before that, he had been appointed representative of the Dalki to the humans by his fellow Dalki Graham, which was why he listened to him more so than the others. Graham could see that he had more strength than the others even before he knew it himself, but when One Horn had finally caught up with them, now having five spikes like the other two.

Graham had told him that he was not to fight against the other leaders. For their powers now were too strong. A fight between two five spikes could possibly destroy anything they were on.

The Supreme commander had received the reports from all the Shelters that the Dalki had stopped their advance and attacks. Some of the Shelters wanted to use this opportunity to try to strike back, but Sach ordered against it.

Going on the attack was not a good option straight after suffering such a large attack. They didn't have the forces, and they needed to use this time to recover. While doing so, everyone who was in the Shelter, including the fighters, were also watching the live stream. This was how nearly everyone in the world was tuned in to watching Hilston against the five spiked Dalki.

Apart from one group in particular.

'This. Fight, it seems to have great importance. We are seeing the strength of a five spike for the first time and seeing what one of our best against one of their best can do. While everyone is distracted, this is the perfect time for you. I hope you stay safe.' Sach thought.

‚Äî‚Äî

The very person that Sach was thinking of had finally arrived at the destination he had been called to. Although they hadn't arrived at the Shelter. Instead, a small army group of around three hundred or so, with Nathan in command, had landed in the middle of the jungle.

'This is the place, the place where Oscar and Sach fought against One Horn.' Nathan thought as he looked off in the direction of the Shelter.
