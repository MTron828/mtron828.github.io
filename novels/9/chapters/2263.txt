One moment, the large ice ball was hurtling towards them. It was impossible to stop, as many different types of attacks and abilities were used against it. Even one of the strongest humans in existence, Jake Green, had used a lava attack, and the ice ball still remained.

Yet somehow, Minny was able to get rid of the attack. What was strange for those looking at the situation, though, was that there was no trace of the attack at all. The ice ball hadn't crashed into the ground.

They didn't see it clash against any type of energy. Instead, it completely disappeared.

"Minny‚Ä¶ what did she do?" Layla raised an eyebrow and noticed the ring on her hand. She hadn't seen it before. It was an item that had been kept in her shadow space. It was very important to her since it was given to her by her father, and it was why she would only bring it out in a situation like this.

"It turns out that there are far more difficult ones than I originally thought, but it doesn't matter. There are many things I can do," he said as his hand started to spiral with lightning.

The attack went straight out from his hand, and the blue lightning bolt was going toward the small little vampire, but showing no fear, she lifted her hand up again, and with the ring lighting up, the attack had completely disappeared. The same thing happened and there was no trace of the attack at all.

Now Minny herself had transformed, and she was in her celestial form. Using her large claws, she was charging up a Blood aura attack. She threw it out, and a large celestial blood claw attack came out.

It looked like a normal blood swipe, only with more condensed energy and it had the power of celestial energy as well.

Seeing this, H was not afraid. As a ten-spike Dalki, he had incredible physical capabilities, including that of speed. So much so, before coming down, he had decided to not take a speed-based ability.

Looking at the attack, he was ready to move out of the way and attack Minny directly. That was until the attack was suddenly right in front of him. The red aura hit his face and scratched against his hard outer body.

Small ripples of red power exploded as the attack managed to hit. However, the attack had barely managed to singe H, and instead, he just had the look of annoyance on his face.

"Fine, let's see how your strange power exactly works!" H stomped on the ground, and the whole floor was instantly covered in ice.

Russ picked up Layla and rushed to the upper floors. The ice hit the building and was slowly climbing up, but it had soon stopped, as H had done what he needed to do.

Minny, avoiding the attack, had jumped up in the air. She couldn't stay in the air forever and would eventually have to land back down in the attack. As for H, unlike Jake, he was unable to use two abilities at the same time.

As he stopped putting power into the ice, he started to put power into his lightning strike again and threw out, this time, two lightning bolts towards her. Minny quickly moved her hand with the ring, one lightning bolt disappearing and then the other.

When she landed back down on the ice, she was completely fine as her feet were covered in shadow, stopping the attack from affecting her.

"This little one is full of tricks," H said to himself.

For now, neither H nor Minny were going full out against each other. After the first few sets of attacks not working, it was almost as if the two of them were testing each other out. It was incredibly intense for everyone watching as they were waiting for the next one to make their move.

So far, though, against all odds of everything they had seen, Minny was holding her ground.

'I haven't completely figured it out yet, but I'm getting close' H thought. 'She didn't bother to do whatever she had been doing so far against the ice attack. There has to be a reason, maybe she was unable to block the ice attack.

'Then when making my lightning attack disappear, she was only able to make one attack disappear at a time. Does this have something to do with her attacks as well?'

In the middle of his thoughts, Minny had stored up power in both of her claws again and threw her attacks out. Just like last time, though, they had just left her fingertips, and as they did, they were suddenly right in front of H's face.

This time he was ready, and emitting a large amount of energy from his body, a slightly yellow aura came out, and dispelled the red energy.

"I can't believe it‚Ä¶ that ten-spike even knows Qi‚Ä¶ what are we meant to do?" Layla said. She didn't like the fact her daughter was out there fighting, but she was the only one who was able to go against him so far, and she knew it was because of the God Slayer item that had been gifted to her.

'It happened again!' H thought. 'The attack didn't suddenly get faster. It was almost as if the attack teleported. Either way, there's no need for me to figure out how she's doing her attacks. What I need to figure out is a way to counter them. If her far attacks can suddenly get close, then this might as well be a close fight!'

H stomped his foot on the ground again, and a spike of ice rose up from the icy floor right below Minny. She moved quickly, with the tip of the spike scratching her red celestial skin. It wasn't strong enough to do damage, and part of it frosted for a bit before the power eventually evaporated.

Spikes of ice started to come up, chasing Minny all over the place. But if there was one thing she was confident in, it was her speed. She continued to run across the ice, zigzagging from one side to the other, to dodge the spikes. Then, jumping up, she lifted both feet and pushed off the ice pillar, heading straight toward H. And just like with the attacks, one moment she had pushed off the ice, and the next she was directly in front of H.

With a bloody clawed celestial powered strike, she swiped right at H, making a fist as hard as she could. Her claws were unable to pierce against the hard scale skin of H, but it had caused his head to move slightly.

In retaliation, with his fast reflexes, H swung his arm out, which transformed once again into that of a blade, ready to slice Minny in half. But the attack had hit nothing but air.

From the movement of H's hand, the sheer power emitted from the strike was large and powerful, cutting right through the ice, going through the buildings off in the distance, and continuing on, cutting everything that got in its path.

Minny had regained distance between the two again and was standing right next to the large strike in the ice. Her heart was beating fast because she knew if she had been hit by that, she would have been killed in an instant.

"I got a hit... I managed to get a hit... but if I get hit once... I die," this thought was running through her head, and she was starting to feel immense pressure.

"I want to run away, I want to call Dad for help, I want Mommy to fight instead. All of this is really scary... but I promised Dad that I can do this... I can do this!" Minny said, looking back at the large strike mark that went on further than she could see through the city.
