Chapter 995 - The Turnaround

When Erlen returned to his classmates, it was safe to say that he wasn’t exactly welcomed with open arms. They couldn’t hear what he had said, and we’re all confused why he had quit the match.

When Erlen went through the glass door, he had returned to the others, and everyone was staring at him.

"Tell me now Erlen!" Aden shouted. "Why didn’t you attack the student from the Cursed house and just forfeit the match like that. Did Hardy pay you off!?"

With everything going on and what he had seen and learnt of Hardy so far, Aden was starting to think he was just some person who had money. One who had reached such a position in the faction due to connections or something else, and now he was suspecting that Erlen had been paid off as well.

"I just thought I was going to lose a lot more if I attacked him," Erlen said, walking past Zhen, who glanced at him from the corner of his eye. Erlen had wholly ignored him going forward.

This just rubbed something inside Zhen, and soon he turned and grabbed Erlen by his collar, lifting him in the air. Zhen was quite a tall student and had a macular frame. Picking up Erlen wasn’t hard, and Erlen’s feet were just tip toeing off the g. Wed.

"Zhen, clam down, we aren’t the only ones here!" Aden said as he started to panic and looked at everyone looking around them. Technically the glass tube was connected all the way around the arena. Although all three houses were placed in separate parts, one could walk through the whole glass area and see all the other teams.

This meant there were plenty of people walking around at this moment that weren’t students or teachers.

Seeing the teacher panic like so, Zhen let go of Erlen’s collar.

"Just remember that we are all part of the same house. Your actions affect the whole team. No one will want someone like you to join if you’re not a team player. You’re selfish." Zhen said, looking away.

"I know I am, which is what I’m trying to fix, and my family is more important than a bunch of fake friends at school," Erlen mumbled, but no one had heard him.

The next fight had progressed, and the student known as Ru from the Cursed house was called and the other number twos. The fight was underway, and something strange seemed to be happening. Those in the Graylash house as well as the Earthborn appeared to be ignoring each other and focused entirely on Ru.

"That’s not fair!" Venus shouted. "If they hadn’t tagged teamed Ru like that, then he would have had a chance at winning."

That’s what many people thought as well. Upon his return, Quinn would make sure to give him the praise he deserved for doing well. With Ru out of the picture, the other two fought, and it was a slim win, but the Earthborn student managed to claim victory.

The results were one win to the Cursed house and one win to Earthborn. With three matches remaining. Even if there was a clear winner, all matches would progress for experience and the event, so Shiro knew he had to fight either way.

He just was hoping that his team would win before then, so the added pressure wouldn’t be on his shoulders.

Despite having lost twice in a row, the teacher for the Graylash house looked unfazed, and when number three was announced, a smile appeared on her face, as a female student had entered the stage.

’The first match the Cursed were only able to win due to us forfeiting, and the Graylash have some skilled people but not enough to pull this win. We have this in the bag.’ Aden thought.

However, when the match started, the female student from the Graylash family threw her sword in the ground and opened up both of her palms. She fired a lightning bolt hitting the students from both families. Then picking up the sword, she ran forward, placing it against the student’s neck, causing him to forefeet and did the same with the other.

"Should that even be allowed?" Fex wondered. "I mean, she didn’t really win using her beast weapon skills. She just used her strong ability."

It was true, but using an ability wasn’t against the rules. Since they were hoping to promote some use of weapons along with an ability. In the end, the win was awarded to the Graylash family, making each team even with one point each.

Finally, the number four was called out, and for this one, on the Cursed house team, Swin had two daggers held in his hand. He didn’t say much as he was waiting for the door to open. Everyone cheered him on, and unlike Venus, who was nervous, Swin seemed more steady and ready.

"That’s the person I taught. So he’s definitely going to win this!" Wevil said, watching from the large screen with hundreds of people from the Cursed faction who had gathered in one of the rooms to watch the event.

The main thing that Wevil had taught Swin, was his state of mind while fighting.

Just like last time, the student from the Graylash family and that from the Earthborn family had gone after the Cursed house. It was obvious what was happening at this point, to where the others were starting to discuss if something was up.

The stadium started to boo. After all, a lot of the students were part of the Cursed house and wanted them to win points for their team.

One of the fighters from the Graylash family was using a staff that they were able to extend and shorten at will. It was a weapon that worked well with the person’s ability. This person extended it hoping to hit Swin in the stomach, and at the same time, the student from the Earthborn group leapt up in the air. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

"The two of you may be working together, but you don’t know how to work together!" Swim said, throwing a dagger off to the side, completely missing the Graylash student. Then with his other dagger, Swin had hit the staff slightly upward so he could protect himself from the large axe the other student was using.

The axe fell down, hitting the pole. The other student was getting ready to retract the pole when he felt a tap on his shoulder.

"You have been eliminated. Stop fighting at once."

The student turned around, confused, only to see that the referee had a dagger held in their hand. Swin didn’t miss, but using his telekinesis, he was able to control the dagger and aim towards the students back, attempting to pierce the heart.

Swin being confident that he would have the Graylash student eliminated from the match, straight away went forward to the Earthborn student. Rolling on the ground, going past the student’s legs slicing him on his way.

He quickly stood up and stabbed him in-between his shoulder guards again. There was a wild swing of the axe, but leaving the dagger stuck in the student’s shoulder, Swin let go and duck down.

During the fight, Swin had retrieved the other dagger using his ability back from the referee and charged in straight away again.

"Idiot, running straight at me!" The Earthborn student shouted, swinging his axe down, but while it was mid-air, with his hand held out, Swin started to use his ability to dig the dagger deeper into the student’s shoulder. It caused immense pain, and for them to stumble missing with the axe swing. At that point, Fay held Swin’s hand in the air so the last dagger wouldn’t hit, intervening with the fight again.

"I think it’s safe to say that the student from the Cursed house is the winner," Fay said in quite an angry tone, wondering why the referee from the Earthborn house didn’t intervene.

Oscar agreed with the decision, and in the end, the Cursed faction had been awarded their second win.

"The Cursed house are the winners!" Oscar shouted.

Cheers from the crowd and those watching in the glass room were going crazy. It was the same on the Cursed ship as well. Swin had done far more than anyone had expected. He was just like Ventus, a nobody with a weak ability, but he had defied the odds by defeating two students at once.

"I guess you’re a good teacher after all," Linda said, hitting Wevil on the shoulder.

Linda still couldn’t control her strength well, so Wevil was rubbing his arm from the pain, but he didn’t care much. For he had this overwhelming feeling seeing a student of his win. It was a warm and fuzzy feeling he had never felt before.

’Are you sure he will be okay?’ Vincent asked. ’You didn’t really teach him much from what I saw, at least not enough to beat a strong ability user.’

’Oh really, is that what you think?’ Quinn replied. ’I guess I really didn’t teach him much, but that’s because of him, not me. Go surprise everyone, Shiro.’
