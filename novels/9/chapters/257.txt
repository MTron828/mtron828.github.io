Chapter 258 Friend from foe

The fight continued on between the Bloodsucker and the king tier beast. At first, when the two of them fought it looked fairly even between them. Neither one of them was getting significantly hurt from the other. This was good for Fex.

When a vampire turned into a Bloodsucker, their health, or in Quinn‚Äôs case Hp was halved. Their wounds would also no longer heal. It was a starved state for vampires. A mode that allowed them to grow stronger in order to consume blood. But also acted as a double edged sword.

However, slowly one of them was starting to get an edge and it looked like it was the Bloodsucker. Quinn was starting to notice that the power and the speed of the king tier beast was finally starting to slow down.

It had been in combat with multiple opponents and multiple times, so it made sense to Quinn but this wasn‚Äôt the reason why. The beast had an inhuman amount of stamina and could continue to fight the students for hours on end.

The reason why it was starting to slow down and weaken was because of its rage mode. Simply put, the crystal inside was drawing out more power then it could generate and now the beast was slowly dying.

Not understanding what was happening, Quinn felt like this was his chance to attack. Whatever happened he needed to get that last hit. He had used most of his MC points during the fight and right now the only skill he could use, was the shadow cloak. Which he used to hide his presence.

Seeing what was happening, Quinn planned to inch closer and closer and try to get behind the king tier beast. While it was distracted fighting, Quinn would prepare the blood hammer and perform a flash step dashing him forward just before delivering the punch.

Trying to implement his strategy, he slowly started to creep towards the fight. On the street, Quinn and the others were stationed on the side of Fex, while the beast was on the other side which led towards the tower.

The fight was still hectic, and the two would span the whole width of the street. The king tier beast threw one of its arms out and the Bloodsucker managed to grab it. Using it‚Äôs increased strength it yanked the arm as hard as it could, ripping it from the beast‚Äôs shoulder.

Black blood once again started to squirt out from the wound. Quinn had seen this before when Logan had done the same thing, soon the beast would heal, but this was Quinn‚Äôs chance.

Running forward and around the two, he wanted to get behind the fight. As he took a step to the side, suddenly, a large claw-like fist came out towards him.

The fist was briefly stopped by the shadow, and when he looked at where it had come from it was from the Bloodsucker.

‚ÄôIt could sense where I was even with the shadow cloak on?‚Äô Quinn thought. ‚ÄôLuckily, I thought something might have happened and prepared my shadow just in case.‚Äô

Quickly, Quinn stepped back and went to his position before. It looked like Fex really could no longer tell between friend and foe.

Now, there was another problem on Quinn‚Äôs hands. The attack from the Bloodsucker, although it was blocked by the shadow that would be the last one. For now, Quinn‚Äôs Mc points had reached zero.

[0/100 Mc]

He couldn‚Äôt complain though. Due to being underground, he was able to use the shadow more often than he usually would have. It seemed like his powers and the amount of Mc points taken to use the skills had lessened while down here.

Yes, he could no longer use his shadow cloak, but against these two, there was no point using it anyway. They both could sense his presence with or without the shadow cloak.

The only thing was, now the others could see him as well. When Quinn had disappeared, they thought he perhaps had left the scene. They never imagined he was still staying so close to the fight.

"Quinn, what are you doing, leave it to the two monsters," Vorden said from above.

"Does your friend have some type of pride or something?" Cia said. "The only reason I can think of him staying is that he wants to be the one to kill the beast."

Layla actually agreed with Cia for once, she didn‚Äôt know the reason why Quinn had chosen to stay. Was he worried about Fex? Or was it something else.

The beast had done the same as last time after its arm had been ripped out. It wanted to take a few steps back and start to recover but the Bloodsucker wasn‚Äôt going to let it go.

When the beast dashed backwards, the Bloodsucker gave chase. Before the others would have been too slow. It didn‚Äôt expect something to be able to match it in speed down here.

With a swipe to its chest, the red roots were split open and the black blood squirted out once again.

"it has to nearly be dead, i need to get that last hit." Obsessed with getting the quest reward for killing the thing, Quinn dashed forward.

When he got close to the two of them, the Bloodsucker had turned around. The beast behind it looked like it was barely standing.

"Come on! Come at me Fex!" Quinn shouted as he threw out his leg, Performing a vertical slice of red aura. Seeing this the Bloodsucker leapt up in the air and it looked like it would close the distance between the two with one jump.

"Quinn!" Layla said worriedly.

Peter was already on the move. He dashed out hoping to take the attack in Quinn‚Äôs place. However, they were just too far and he would never make it in time.

The others expected Quinn to attempt to dodge, but instead, he started to go through the motion of the hammer strike, timing everything perfectly with when the Bloodsucker had jumped, just when it was about to land, Quin performed a flash step.

Avoiding the attack and also appearing in front of the king tier beast.

"Blood hammer!" The beast was already weak, and using all the strength he could, he snapped back his arm and with the punch, released the power of the level two blood spray performing a blood hammer.

A loud shotgun-like sound was echoed through the underground town.

Carefully, Quinn had hit the same spot where the Bloodsucker had clawed out the roost protecting its upper body. Unlike before the attack seemed to go through.

"Did he do it?" Layla thought.

Peter had stopped running, and a smile appeared on his face. He could tell Quinn had done it because he himself felt stronger.

[Quest completed]

[Defeat the king tier beast]

Multiple notification screens appeared at the same time but Quinn didn‚Äôt have much time to read all of them. For while celebrating his Victory, a strong fist came out from the side hitting him on the body and sending him flying through the air. REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

Looking down, Quinn could see the Bloodsucker‚Äôs, ugly face.
