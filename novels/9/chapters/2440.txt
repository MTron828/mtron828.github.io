The frantic teleporting continued as Quinn was held onto by the others, and it almost felt like the others didn't even have time to ask what was going on. They kept going to a new area, even if there was no one around Sil would teleport them once again. 

In the end, Peter was the one that got fed up the most. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

"STOP!" Peter shouted. "Quinn is not responding, we need to see if he's okay." 

The Boneclaw had handed Quinn's body over to Peter before going back to a marking. Worried, even with the frantic teleportation, Peter was trying to see if Quinn was okay, but it was a hard task to do. 

Sil teleported a couple more times, he soon was in a forest, among trees as large as mountains that sprinkled in light from above. He quickly looked around the area, and in the distance there was a cliff side, he teleported a few times more, and on the cliff's side edge there looked to be a natural cave that went inside. 

It didn't go in deep, but it was a place they could stay at for now where one wouldn't be able to find them easily, at least that's what Sil believed. 

Once they were inside the cave, Peter laid Quinn's body on the ground, out of the sun. He was a vampire and although he wasn't affected by the sun anymore, Peter wanted to do anything to see if his condition was fine. 

Placing his ear on Quin's chest, he waited patiently, and after around ten seconds or so, he could hear his heart beat a single time. 

"Ah, thank f*ck!" Peter said, letting out a big sigh of relief. 

Edvard could already sense Quinn was alive, and although he didn't look well, he was much more concerned about another member of their group. Sil wasn't physically tired and yet he had sweat running down the side of his face, and his hands were trembling slightly. 

"Sil… is everything alright?" Edvard said. "What happened back there, what's got you all shaken up?" 

Sil didn't answer immediately, instead he placed his hands over his face for a few seconds before letting go and taking in a big breath, he seemed to be a little better. 

"Sorry about that, it's just.." Sil paused again. "The energy, I could still feel it, I could sense it in the air. The anger, it's as if his emotions are linked to this entire plane." Sil waved his hand through the red air and the particles moved up and down like floating dust. 

"I don't know how to explain, but I had a feeling that if we didn't move far enough away, he would have chased us down and found us. No matter where we were, I had to try to get as far away as possible… just to be safe." 

"And do you think we're safe here right now?" Edvard asked. 

The silence gave away his answer, but he knew Sil must have been exhausted. How many different planets had they travelled to due to his power. Sil's power was incredibly strong, but there was a limit and he felt like Sil had already used it. 

"I'm not sure, but I have a back up plan just in case." Sil answered. "The clones, at the same time as we were moving, every single one of them is teleporting everywhere around the place that they can. 

"Although Immortui might be able to feel us, I don't think he'll be able to know which one is the real one, all of them are distractions for the time being, so it should buy some time. As each one is taken out as well, as long as they are able to, I'll get an update just before."

It wasn't a confident answer, but Sil needed to restore his MC cells and rest anyway. For a few minutes, the group did next to nothing, they were just waiting, it was as if they were checking if Immortui was on their tail, or if anyone else was. 

After fifteen minutes had passed, the tension in their bodies eased a little more. The fact that Sil hadn't gotten a report of one of his clones being chased down left him more confident than before. 

Now, Sil had time to focus on Quinn as he went over to his body on the ground. Peter had his back up against the cave wall, staying only ten centimetres away from his lying body. 

He hadn't moved an inch which was quite impressive. 

"What's wrong with him, why isn't he getting up, is he just in a deep sleep?" Peter asked. 

Sil having recovered some of his energy, his hands started to glow green and he moved it over Quinn's body, up and down from the bottom of his toes to the top of his head, he then focused on the head for a few moments but there were no signs at all.

"He's not injured in any way. I would like to think that he was just sleeping." Sil said. "But when we were travelling through those tunnels, following those demons, I heard what Immortui said, he said that he was going to make him experience hell."

Finishing his sentence, several footsteps landed on the ground, causing everyone to flinch and turn to the centre of the cave, where a group of people had just appeared. 

"Calm down." Sil stated. "We know them."

Getting a better look, they really did know them, it was a clone of Sil, along with Hikel, Chris and Russ. In a normal case, maybe the group would have shared what they had gone through, afterall it was a pretty extreme thing they had gone through, instead they ignored all the people around them, as they rushed to where Quinn was. 

"Quinn!" Chris said, running over. 

"What… what happend?" Hikel asked. 

The finer details were explained to the group, at least what they knew because they didn't know much apart from Quinn was most likely facing Immortui. The truth was they didn't even know he had faced a demon beforehand, or the circumstances leading up to the current event. 

Chris and the others hadn't shared what they had been through, the atmosphere, it felt too sombre for that. They didn't need more bad news of powerful enemies they had escaped from by the skin of their teeth. 

"So what do we do now?" Russ asked all of them. "Are we just going to wait around till he wakes up? You have to know that he might never wake up, right?

"And what's with you guys in the first place, you said you came here to support him. To help him take down Immortui, not to stop him, well, then I think you guys should be doing whatever you can to freaking support the guy!" Russ shouted. 

The person that cared about Quinn the least, had made the most sense in the current situation they were in. That was the real question though, with Quinn the way he was now, what should they do?
