Supercharging himself, Chris had used the power of his Qi, the power in his werewolf body, and the power in his hands to strike down on the giant ship. The ship which he was unable to make a scratch on the outside before, the ship that was built to go against the powerful celestials that ruled. 

With a swing of both of his arms, a large power was unleashed and a thunderous roar exploded with the swing of his arms as he sliced right through the ship. The claw marks had gone right through the top deck, breaking right through until it slashed the centre.  Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The two halves had broken, and the weight of each side was being lifted in the air, as everyone was now falling to the ground below.

The werewolves were desprealty clawing at the air as they fell to the ground, while some had been struck in the air by the Divine beings before they even fell to the ground. 

In the midst of all the chaos, Unzoku was trying to find the culprit that had started this all, and then he could see it. 

"It's that red one from before!" Unzoku smiled, revealing the back of his large razor sharp teeth. Although Chris wasn't currently red and using his stage 4 Qi form, the demon king did make note of the werewolf's appearance, this was because he had made quite the impression on him. 

The large ship had crashed onto the city below, crushing the buildings and the werewolves, although they had taken quite a big tumble, would be able to survive something like this. The many werewolves started to emerge from the wreckage, and they wasted no time as they leapt up, attacking the Divine beings in front of them. 

Some stretched out their hand pulling the spears away from their hands then leaping up and biting down on their necks. When doing this though, no blood would be drawn, it was hard to tell what the Divine beings were because they almost didn't seem alive.

——

Edvard had finally reached the Yak city, and just as he had predicted, many of the Divine beings that had been following him up till this point, had split off to fight the demons close by. 

While Edvard had jumped into one of the giant houses. He quickly went up the stairs and leapt up on top of one of the giant beds and was now lying on the giant mattress. 

'This is nice to just take a breather for a moment.' 

The fighting was still furiously going off outside, with explosions going off one after another. At any moment, a demon or a Divine being, could come crashing through the building, but Edvard just wanted to rest. 

'Hopefully with my ability, nothing will end up coming this way.' 

While lying down, there was something else that Edvard wanted to do, and that was to check the state of his body. Why was he still in so much pain, after receiving the hit from before?

Looking down, he was taking a peek under his armour. It was hard to see, so he proceeded to take off part of the gauntlet around his arms and as he did a horrifying sight occurred. 

Blood was already seeping out from the armour, falling onto the mattress, and his arm looked like a tangled mess. All of the bones in the arm itself looked to have been shattered in a way, piercing his skin. 

'How is this possible?' Edvard thought to himself, and quickly locked the armour in again. There was a searing pain he could feel the moment he took off the armour. 

'Wait, could it be because of the armour? Is it holding everything in my body in place right now? If I take this off, would my whole body just fall apart, am I only alive because I still have this armour on?' 

It was a crazy theory to have, but looking at the state of just his arm, he was willing to believe it. The attack from the demon king, the Yak Bisha. Although the armour was still intact, his body wasn't and ever since the attack he didn't quite feel the same. 

'This might go beyond something my vampire body can heal… Chris, it looks like you might be on your own on this one. I know you can beat that ugly werewolf.' Edvard smiled.

With the situation the way it was, Edvard eventually lifted his upper body and stared out of the large window. It showed just what was happening outside. Moving closer, he wanted to get a better view, and he could see that far off into the distance several more objects were heading their way, heading toward the land of the giants.

'Those are the same type of ships that were being built on this planet, and there are so many of them.' 

On each of the giant ships there were different demon races that were approaching. As they made their way to the planet, they had brought along with them a horde of Divine beings. 

A full scale battle was going on as the demons were fighting back. It wasn't just the demons that they had seen so far, but many different types as well, and there were even a few ships that just had a concentrated amount of werewolves on them as well. 

The planet of the giants was becoming the centrepiece for a large-scale war. 

——

After the giant ship had fallen out of the sky, falling to the ground below. Chris allowed himself to drop down, landing in the middle of the chaos. As he did, he was looking straight ahead at the large sized Unzoku. 

"It seems you've managed to gain some power. I guess you decided to listen to my advice after all." Unzoku said. 

One of the werewolves had caught onto Chris, and immediately dashed towards him. When he got close, a blur appeared from Chris' arm and then went back in place. It was hard to see, but the results were clear. 

The werewolf's body had been sliced, split from the top of the head down to every part of its body. Several pieces had been made and they fell to the ground. 

The tough Glutton werewolves who were at the pinnacle of a werewolf had been killed with a strike that hadn't been seen. 

"You have gotten very strong, how were you able to amass such power in such a short time?" Unzoku wondered. 

Chris looked at his hand again, and it started to transform into its werewolf form. The fur on his body was growing. 

"I was already strong, having grown my Qi strength as high as possible, using the skill of the Qi drain." Chris said to himself. "My own body had grown incredibly strong before I had even become a werewolf… and now the werewolf part of me has grown in strength as well. Having consumed another one of you demon kings, I have obtained a new strength. 

"This is my power!"
