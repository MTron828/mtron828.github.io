Chapter 1180 You are not in charge of us!

The reaction on the table was as expected. The Sergeants and Longblade had seemingly forgotten about Quinn being in the room with them and had started to discuss how to tackle this request. Sergeant Till had naturally instantly wanted to refuse it, while the others had insisted to think this through, it was apparent that they were not too enthusiastic about just leaving.

Quinn wasn’t too surprised given their reaction. He too had initially been shocked when Shiro had told him about the promise as well as the memories he had experienced inside the Demi-god tier beast’s head. It was commendable, how much the beast cared for its home planet to the point it was willing to give away its body.

In some ways, it was similar to humanity’s attachment to Earth. Despite being able to live on Shelters on relatively safe planets, none would decline if given the chance to live on that one planet.

As long as they were able to fulfill the wishes of the humanoid beasts, Quinn didn’t doubt they would keep their promise. Back in the lab, the scientist had pleaded the beast to forgive them, before freeing it. After regaining its freedom, it could have easily taken revenge against those humans who had taken it prisoner and tortured it.

And yet, it had repaid her kindness by not killing any humans, trying to make them leave in a non-lethal way.

’In some ways, those beasts are more honourable than humans.’ Quinn thought.

"I’m sorry, Quinn, but that is not something I can do for you." Longblade stated after the military leaders had come to a conclusion in their discussion. "This planet is one of the major mining points that supplies the entirety of the Earthborn group with beast crystals. Especially in the current times, we can’t just give up such a strategic point."

Planet Humding seemed to have more natural beast crystals inside it compared to any other, and on top of that they also had the facility that was used to experiment on the beasts as well. Quinn had already been prepared that things wouldn’t be that easy, yet he still remained calm.

The Demi-god tier beast was now looking his way, its eyes formed to slits. It was clear Raten wasn’t in control, and he wanted answers. The soldiers surrounding the humanoid tier beast became nervous and were ready to act if it became violent.

"Colonel Longblade, do you know what would happen to this planet if you continue mining those crystals?" Quinn questioned. "Ever since beasts were discovered, scientists have wondered how they are created. They lack reproductive organs like other mammals have them. According to my friend here, I now know the answer."

"The beasts originally stem from the beast crystals that are produced by the planet, the ones we mine. You take all of the beast crystals, then will it also mean you are taking the beast’s lives. With all the crystals gone, there will be no more beasts and the planet will die." Quinn shared what he had learned.

According to the humanoid beast, each planet had a special type of crystal he called a ’nest’ that would produce those beasts, letting them grow. That nest could survive in any type of environment.

Surprisingly, the military never seemed to have found those nests, which made Quinn wonder if they were hard to come by, or that might be information only someone like Oscar would have known.

"That’s touching and all, but in case you’ve forgotten, we still have a war to fight!" Till challenged Quinn’s point. "You wear beast gear yourself, don’t you? Doesn’t the Cursed faction kill beasts as well, to create stronger tools? What’s the difference between killing beasts and destroying the planet they live on?"

"Well, he isn’t exactly human." Joy mumbled, a little afraid to say it out loud. He agreed with Till to some degree. Although he understood there was a huge difference between killing beasts and destroying a planet, they needed the ressources if they were to stand a chance against the Dalki. If it meant ruining a planet, well that was a small price to pay for the future of humanity.

"I’m not here to argue about whether your group in particular or any of the other groups mining for crystals in general are right or wrong." Quinn stated. "This was the agreement that we made with the humanoid Demi-god tier beast in order for him to work with us. And I do intend to keep this promise."

Till chuckled at this fact. "Making promises to beasts without caring about humanity as a whole. What else should one expect from someone who is a V. In case you’ve forgotten, this planet isn’t under your jurisdiction!"

Although Longblade didn’t like the way his Sergeant was talking to his savior, he wasn’t wrong. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

"I apologise for the rudeness of Sergeant Till, but he has a point. You might be one of the World Leaders, but each one of you is only responsible for your own planets. Only someone with higher authority than Head General Innu or himself could order us to leave."

Quinn just smiled politely, still calm. "Well, why don’t we ask someone like that then?"

The Cursed faction leader placed a strange circular device in the middle of the table. Logan had handed it over before they left him at night. It had a large green surface on the top, with a few touch buttons around the edge.

When placed on the table, Quinn pressed a couple of buttons, and it started to glow for a while, until it eventually displayed a holographic figure. Recognising the person, the military men immediately stood up.

"Head General Sach, I hope you are doing well." Longblade saluted his superior.

"At ease." Sach replied.

When seeing who had called him, Sach made sure that he would answer it, but he didn’t expect to be called in the current situation they were in at the moment.

"What do you need help with, Quinn? I can’t imagine you called me here in front of others for no reason?" Sach asked.

Nobody missed that the Head General seemed to be on a first name basis with the other. However, even more surprising was the fact that Quinn somehow had the personal number of the Head General. Just what was their relationship?

’Quinn, is this why you didn’t seem to be worried?’ Longblade wondered. ’Although Head General Sach does rank above us, we were technically under Head General Innu before. Even if he orders it, we can’t comply until a new leader for our group has been selected.’

Usually, there would be a vote and a meeting for others to come and select a new Head General. Or a recommendation from a rank higher, the supreme commander. The Supreme Commander could also appoint someone on their own to be in charge but nothing had been heard from Oscar either.

"I am currently on Humding and I wish for all operations on this planet to stop. If possible, it would be great if it could be handed over to the Cursed faction. In exchange I’m willing to offer you one of the Cursed faction planets in return. I know they’re not in the same vicinity but this is important to me." Quinn requested. "Helen should be able to select one, with a similar crystal output."

It didn’t take long for Sach to give an answer like the others had suspected.

"I will comply with your request Quinn. I think it’s a fair deal and I believe the leader of the Cursed faction must have his reasons for doing so." Sach nodded.

"Head General Sach, excuse my interruption, but I don’t believe you have the authority to agree to such a thing!" Longblade had to step in. He didn’t want a dispute to arise just because of this, but they were all military men. They had to follow the proper procedure and it had to be given by someone who was allowed to do that.

"I guess since the announcement will go out in a few hours anyway, I might as well be the one to tell you all. There was a majority vote from the fifty seats. I, Sach, have been voted in as the new Supreme Commander. So, yes, Colonel, I believe I DO have the authority." Sach stated with a large smile.

The others were wondering if they might have misheard or possibly they were dreaming. They didn’t understand why there was even a vote in the first place for a new Supreme Commander.

"What is going on? Is this really Head General Sach?" Till asked.

Sach just gave out a sigh, prepared that they might not believe him.

"If you wish to wait, you should soon get a confirmation. Quinn, there will also be a few other announcements. One of them will be about what Head General Innu had attempted to do to you."
