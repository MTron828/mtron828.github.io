Cuteness Unleashed
0.00 / 0.00

It was a restless sleep for Quinn that night, that was for sure, but when he woke up, he still didn't let any of what had happened, deter him from his original plan. He had informed the group that he would be leaving to head off to another planet, in search of the Blades.

This time, Layla knew it was coming and so did the rest. What they didn't know was the fact that Quinn would ask Russ to come with them, and even he seemed surprised.

'I had planned to laze around and enjoy myself here. There are a few cuties among the Memerial race, but of course the vampire needs to ruin it all.' Russ thought.

There was one more surprise though, when informing the others, Ceril was with them as well, and she had claimed that she wished to join Quinn while he was on his journeys.

"Are you sure about this?" Quinn asked. "Don't you want to spend time on your home planet, and with your sister?"

Ceril shook her head.

"We have done a lot of catching up already. We spent many years together as well, but the longer I stay here, and learn of what everyone has done without me, the more I feel like this is no longer my home."

Quinn somewhat understood the feelings Ceril was going through, it was most likely she could feel that was different from the rest as well.

"It would be a pleasure to have you come with us, but I warn you that it might not be easy. Trouble does seem to follow me around at times." Quinn half joked.

This was better for him in all honesty, as he was a little worried about Ceril and what might happen to her while she was away. The best thing was to check up on her once in a while, so no accidents occurred.

As for what had happened, and the people he met, he chose not to inform Layla and his family of that matter. It wouldn't change nor help anything anyway.

"Minny, I'm leaving you in charge while I'm away." Quinn said. "If anything dangerous happens, remember to use what I gave you."

Minny nodded and pumped her fist, she still had yet to use the gift her father had given her because she hadn't been involved in any direct conflict that warranted her using it, but hearing her father give her such an important task she was ready.

The group were travelling through space, now it was just the three of them, and neither of them talked to each other much. They were a mismatched group. It was fine for Quinn because the quietness while travelling gave him time to think.

'We don't really have an idea of where to go...but I do have this.' Quinn thought as he looked at the nano stick in his hand. 'They said it has the location of where to go. Does that mean it will take me to the Blades?'

The problem was whether to take their help or not, and there was something else on the stick that Quinn was greatly interested in.

'He said that there was something about my parents here. I didn't miss hear him right?' Quinn thought to himself. 'But...what could it be? They can't still be alive, they died in the war. I was told they had died in the war, and even if they hadn't they wouldn't have been able to live for so long, not without some sort of influence.'

Letting out a big sigh, in the end Quinn decided to stick the stick into the main system of the ship.

'Sam, because you have done so much for me, I will choose to trust you this time again.'F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The console lit up green for a second, before lighting up as usual. The ship took a drastic turn as it started to head in a completely different direction.

"Can you warn us next time?" Russ said, as his hand was on the side of the ship, having nearly fallen over.

Despite all of that, Quinn had decided to ignore them, because something had come up almost immediately. The hologram display was starting up and a video was starting to play. The screen was showing two people, a male and a female. The female was a beauty with long straight brown hair that went perfectly down her sides.

Even though she was doing nothing but staring at the camera, there was this air of peace around her. Just seeing her, was making Quinn calm. Then there was the man who had black curly hair. He looked to be a little rough around the edges.

He had stubble that was out of control, a bit patchy and a dark bags under his eyes as if he hadn't been to sleep in a while. The two of them were in a plain room, there was no furniture and only a small window in the back.

In some cases it looked like a prison cell, but judging by their actions and the smile the two of them had on their faces, it didn't look like a prison cell at all.

'Even after all this time...even though I was so young when they left me, I can still recognize them, I can still remember what they look like.' The video hadn't really started but Quinn was already using his clothes to cover up his eyes, as he could see his mother and father.

After finding out that Quinn was no longer in the specially made locked space, Mundus had returned to the celestial space almost immediately. Nearly falling to the ground, his usual seat rose, catching him before he had done.

'I don't understand. I searched and searched but he was no longer in that space. How can that even be possible?' Mundus thought.

'There has never been a celestial that was able to escape from something like that. The special space was something that was created by one of the Elders. There were hardly any rules when creating the space so the seal should have been strong.'

Either way, it was clear that Quinn was no longer in the space, and he needed to do something. The one thing that he didn't want to do was report to the elders that an individual had slipped from his hands.

'He could be anywhere right now, and I need to find him as soon as possible, so I need some help.'

Mundus knew who to call for help, because during this tough period he had become his messenger of sorts. A few moments later, a floating ball of energy called Xox arrived.

"I have an important task for you." Mundus ordered. "However, you are not to let any of the others know. They are not to learn of this apart from those you decide you can trust in keeping this a secret."

Quinn was already a problem for the celestials and if they were to learn that they were looking for him again, it would cause a panic among them.

"I need you to find Quinn Talen, the Celestial that is also known as BB. As soon as you find him, report back to me immediately."

That dreaded name shook Xox. Ever since he had met with BB, his life had been harder than he felt like it should have been.

"Right away sir!" Xox answered and was off.

While running through the celestial space to complete the task quickly, he was starting to think who he could trust, and who might be able to help him best. In recent times, there was someone who he became close with, and was already doing a task for him.

Xox started to head to earth, and eventually ran into another Celestial.

"Yonbu!" Xox called out. "I have an important task, you can forget about Earth for now. I need your help, we need to find BB."

Just like Xox, You had a knee jerk reaction as he took a step back and shook his head.

"You don't understand. This is an order from Mundus, you have to help me, and no one can know about it. You met him before right, so maybe you would have an idea of where he would be?" Xox asked.

Yonbu didn't want to get involved, but if it was Mundus' order it was already too late.

"I don't really have a good idea, but...I guess we can start from my planet, there are those that know of him."
