Chapter 1184 Blood delivery

It could already be considered a blessing that the Cursed group managed to find not one, but two humanoid beasts on the same planet, allowing them to fulfill Sil’s wish in one go. Finding three humanoid beasts, especially ones of such a high tier would have been too much to ask for.

Of course, this was only possible because of the Earthborn group. If one hadn’t escaped, forcing Longblade’s group to request backup, the Cursed group might have never found out about Muddy and it was solely because of Logan stumbling around that they met Tails.

After hearing Quinn confirm for the third time that he wanted to bring him back, Vincent had something to say back about it. ’Quinn, I already made it clear that if I had the chance I would support you. After watching you fight for so long, it would be my honor to help you not just by guiding you and giving you advice, but by actively fighting by your side.’

’That being said, I have already lived my life, Quinn. At the end I even gave up being a vampire, so it could eventually end. I was sure that everyone I cared about had already left this world, and I never imagined that there would be someone new I would care about. Which is why I don’t want you to waste too much effort on me.’

’Let’s just take up Eno on his offer, or see if Logan can create a clone.’

Quinn wanted to interrupt Vincent, and argue back for many reasons. A clone was known not to have a long life, and trusting Eno with such a thing was a big mistake especially since he should have been unaware that Vincent had been still in the system.

’I know you don’t trust him, but Eno’s clones are still able to use their vampire powers. You’ve seen it and have felt it. I would be far more helpful if I would have access to my full power, instead of having to learn to use the body of some humanoid beast.’

’As for the ten years, it should be enough time for me to help you win this war, achieve what you wish for and leave you, my family line of Eno. I know you’re a Talen, but you have Eno blood in you.’

Having experienced Vincent’s life from his perspective, Quinn had shared the old man’s feelings at that time. His descendant knew that his ancestor wasn’t going to back down on this, he had already made his decision.

’...fine, but we’ll ask Logan about this first. If he is unable to create such a body, I will attempt to request one from Eno the next time I meet him, hopefully without him finding out about everything.’ Quinn reluctantly agreed.

Finishing this tough conversation, Quinn was ready to just get the rest of the worst parts over and done with.

He decided to find Layla next. On their flight back Quinn had noticed that she had seemed down. Given the circumstances it had been impossible to capture Agent 2, and just like Fex, Quinn had been unable to break Agent 11’s mental barrier to force him to speak up.

He still didn’t know the whole story of what had happened before he had arrived, but since this was a rather delicate and personal situation, he had refrained from discussing it with her on the ship.

Fortunately, finding specific crew members wasn’t too hard for Quinn. Layla was one of those he had personally turned, creating a bond that allowed him to sense her presence within a certain distance, after which it would weaken. As useful as this was, it had nevertheless led to another unfortunate consequence for the two of them.

Quinn knocked on the door of one of the smaller personal training rooms, where he knew Layla to be. Waiting for a few moments, he heard a female voice allowing him entry. Inside, he saw the girl seemingly meditating.

"Do you need to do that because you have a lot on your mind?" Quinn asked Layla, whose eyes were still closed.

She had placed the black sword Longblade had gifted her in front of her.

"I was actually running a few tests with this sword. I’m amazed that it has the ability to disrupt certain abilities. Just by touching it, I’m unable to gather energy in that arm, but the rest of my body is still able to use its powers."

"I was testing if it could be used to control my emotions, so that... you know, I won’t endanger you guys if I ever take on that form again. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be the case. However, I can still use it to get rid of the negative smog that covers my body, so in a way it does help me."

This information was similar to what Quinn had gathered as well. The sword only affected what it touched, so it didn’t stop the Vampire Lord from using his abilities, but only through the sword itself or trying to use it directly at the sword.

"I think you know that this wasn’t what I meant when I said you had a lot on your mind. The others told me what Agent 2 said before you changed. Do you want to talk about it?" Quinn asked, trying to find the fine line between asking as a leader, her friend and perhaps something more than that.

"So you’ve heard it as well?" Layla sulked and placed her head down. "I-I don’t know what I want to do, Quinn. On one hand I want to learn the truth about my father, I want to speak to Pure’s leaders to find out what really happened."

"However, after what Agent 2 said... I mean I knew that she had differences with the other leaders, but for them all to hate her. Maybe he was just saying those things to rile me up? ... but for some reason, I can’t help but feel that some part of it might be true..."

"You might be surprised how much I can sympathise with your desire." Quinn replied, stretching out one hand to put on her shoulder, but stopping midway, afraid of the possible backlash. "I just want you to know that whatever happened has already happened. I don’t know what really happened, but at the end of the day, your mother had you."

"Lucy might not have always shown it to you, but there’s one I’m certain about, your mother loved you to the bitter end. Whatever the truth may end up being, you don’t have to shoulder it yourself. We your friends, will be there for you."

’... I will be there for you.’

"... thanks, Quinn." Layla weakly replied, her head still hidden. His sharpened senses told Quinn that she was sobbing lightly. Unsure whether his words of advice actually helped or worsened the situation, Quinn decided to leave the room for now and return to her at a later time after she had a bit of time to think about it.

The next stop on Quinn’s list since it was nearby was to head to the large training room. Here while walking through the halls, he could hear the sound of a loud bang, and the shaking of the ship.

Entering the room, Quinn soon saw the reason for it. Standing at the front, Nate was demonstrating a set of moves, which the others followed. The explosion was actually everyone using Qi in their attacks all at once. When the trainees soon saw the Cursed faction leader enter, they quickly stopped what they were doing and bowed down to him.

"Oh, Boss, you come at the perfect time. I would say I’ve done a pretty good job teaching them, right?" Nate had a smug smile on his face. "You gave me a task and I did everything I could to complete it! Every single one of them knows how to power Qi through their bodies and their weapons. Even if they have weak abilities, they will become a force to be reckoned with!"

"That is good news! I guess now it’s time I show you something else." Quinn nodded as he pulled out the sword that had been given to him by Longbalde. He slowly raised the sword up, and started to spin the sword until it was around thirty centimeters of the ground. Everyone was looking carefully at the demonstration. Looking at the floor, they could see it.

Quinn had purposely moved the sword slowly so they could watch his minute actions. A scratch mark was being left on the surface of the floor despite the blade not touching it directly.

"This is the second stage of Qi. I’m going to show you a few things, and I hope you can teach others as well." Quinn requested with a smile.

In the past, Nate would have complained about being given such a task, but he was actually more excited than usual. Qi was perfect for someone like him who studied martial arts and he had developed a strong interest in this strange power.

While trying to teach Nate how to use Qi, Quinn was thinking back to his battle against Agent 2. All of the Agents had also been capable of using Qi. They didn’t have any numbers that made them out to be double digit Agents, which led Quinn to believe that Pure had started teaching all of its members this technique.

Unfortunately, Pure seemed to have more knowledge in that regard. The Cursed faction leader only had limited experience with the third stage and he was certain that whatever the Pure Agent leader had used had been an even stronger stage, so they might end up being more powerful.

"I trust you with this." Quinn patted Nate on the back and left the room.

After dealing with his ’Unofficial duties’, he decided to visit Sam to check out his official ones, which would take the most time to deal with. Once he was in the command centre, Quinn asked just what Sam thought would be the next best thing.

"Well, I recently received an update from Alex. The good news is that they were able to complete the blood weapons for you. Unfortunately, your Demon tier weapon will still require a bit more time. Once it is done, they’ll return to the Cursed ship."

"The ones who need the weapons the most are Helen and the others on the front line of the faction planets. They have scuffled a few times with the Dalki, since their attacks are starting to spread."

"They fought with the Dalki?" Quinn was quite surprised since he hadn’t been called or alerted.

"At the moment, all the groups are suffering from their attacks. Don’t worry, they have been at a level that we have been able to deal with on our own. Don’t forget, you’re not the only one who can fight in the Cursed faction. You will be called if needed, Quinn!"

"Anyway, public opinion seems to be back on our side after the video of you being attacked by Head General Innu has been shared, especially amongst those within the Cursed faction. I think this might be a good chance to boost morale. You would just have to visit a few planets as their leader, bringing them the weapons they need right now. They will surely remember that!"

Thinking about it, Quinn didn’t know what else there was for him to do. He could train his shadow and blood abilities, but there wasn’t a strong partner to do that with. The device Logan had picked up had yet to discover any more demon tier beast, and he was still waiting on the current weapon to be made.

"I guess that’s not a bad idea. I’ll give Helen a visit and deliver the blood weapons. It should kill some time before the Demon-tier weapon is complete."
