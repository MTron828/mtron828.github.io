After watching the whole simulation, Quinn was going through a mixture of feelings. The ending hadn't been caught‚Ä¶ the conclusion to the fight‚Ä¶ the final fight between Sil and H. For whatever reason, perhaps their battle had destroyed the cameras on the ships, or their battle took place far away from where they were, with both of them using everything they had. Still, the outcome was clear, as Sil had made a choice.

'Sil‚Ä¶ you have changed so much from when I first met you. You really decided to be selfless in the end.' Quinn thought.

It had become apparent through the simulation, from the very beginning when he whispered into Shiro's ears, that the Blades were the most important to him. No matter what, he wanted to make sure to protect them.

When seeing H though, there was a mixture of confused feelings, and for a short while, Sil felt it was his duty once again to stop this person‚Ä¶ Until Borden had fallen. Because of that, it allowed him to snap back into his right mind.

Sil was never sure during the fight if he could beat H, the two of them were pretty even, but Sil still had yet to try everything. If he could, he could have just taken himself and H off the planet they were on, away from everyone else. However, the ship would then still be able to attack the other Blades, and more Dalki could be sent.

Borden was no longer there, a big help in clearing the Dalki, so it was safe to say they would have certainly struggled to survive. Another option was taking all of the Blades along with H and teleporting them onboard the ship.

Yet the ship was an unknown. The being known as H had come from it, and it was taking the Blades into the heart of the enemy's territory. If he couldn't beat H, then it would mean all of the Blades would have perished. So the only way to make sure that the Blades survived was to do what he had done, but it came with a sacrifice, the sacrifice of losing the battle.

'I think‚Ä¶ in the same situation, I would have done the same thing.' Quinn thought to himself, as he went on to listen to what Logan had to say.

The simulation around them had faded, and they were again in the large white room. Now, they were all watching a video of Logan in his lab, just like he was in the original message.

'He said Sil was still alive‚Ä¶ which means there is a way to still help him at least.' Quinn thought. But it did trouble him as to why they would keep such a big threat alive.

"The device that Vincent and I had made for Jim and Jack, it has caused more problems than we thought. The reason for keeping Sil alive is so that he can be used in that very same device. The Blade ability allows one to copy the powers of anyone that is a human.

"And it seems his power Is not limited by god slayer abilities. After Sil had been defeated, he was placed in the device. A point that I didn't mention earlier, because it wasn't important at the time, needs to be said.

"That going in the device itself is draining to the user. All of the MC cells are taken out of the body to use the device in a certain way. I assume Sil was placed in this device immediately, not giving him a second chance to fight back. The one known as Malik, allowed Sil to copy his ability, and after that, along with the device, whenever they needed to mass change everyone's memories, they used Sil to do this.REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

"How they do this I'm not sure. I doubt they would have changed Sil's memories because they fear him. If he was ever to find out the truth, then he could simply revert everything back to the way it was himself.

"Which is why, it's better for them to keep him captive and locked in the device, constantly draining his MC cells away, only to be used when needed. How exactly they get him to use the ability as they command, I'm not sure."

An image of a tired Sil appeared in Quinn's head. It was making his blood boil. One that was only doing good for the human race, trying to protect them and help them. He hadn't lived a good life, and now he was being hurt every second and doing things against his will.

"However, I do know where he currently is. I have gathered this information, and what you are about to hear may surprise you. At the moment between Jack and Jim, they run ten Marpo Cruises.

"All of these are filled with their allies from other planets, as well as Dalki with abilities and vampires. There are two main Marpo Cruise lines that are exclusively used by Jim and Jack. From what I can gather, there seems to be a bit of tension between the two of them, so they no longer travel together.

"But they have set up a sort of system of sorts. When one has Sil, the other has Malik by their side. Whenever they wish to use the power in a wide range, the two must be brought together, for whatever reason.

"Right now, as of recording this video, Jack has Sil captured aboard his Marpo Cruise ship. I doubt that will change anytime soon as there is no reason for them to use the ability again, at least not any time soon."

Since Quinn didn't know what Malik looked like, he was unsure if he was by Jim's side or not. He knew that Ray was with him when they were on the Namrik planet, but there was a good chance he could have been on the cruise ship as well.

For now, it was best to assume that Malik was still with Jim, and Sil was with Jack, but how would he know where Jack was, and what cruise ship he was on? Would Quinn have to attempt to destroy every single one of them one by one.

"Sil is very important to them Quinn, so you don't have to worry about him, we have time with this." Logan continued to explain. "You see, although in the simulation we see H using the Blade ability, I suspect that just like Sil, the abilities that H can copy are limited to other Dalki.

"Which means, he can only use the abilities that have been stolen from Jack and put into other Dalki. Malik is his own person, and to convince someone to take their ability and put it in a Dalki is a hard thing to do. Otherwise they would just use H for all of this.

"The reason why I'm telling you this, is because based on the research I have of you, you are most likely to go ahead, and attempt to attack Jack to rescue Sil, but that is a bad idea.

"The cruise ships are extremely dangerous. They are filled with those from different races, somehow Jim and Jack have managed to make some sort of pact with them. They have more attacks planned throughout the universe and plan to take in more prisoners, slaves and so on. They seem to have gone mad with competition between each other.

"On top of that, each of the cruise ships are filled with Dalki. Dalki that have more spikes than the last war, and their numbers are almost tenfold of what they were. Let's not forget that they all have abilities as well. Think about it, there are a number of them that are on the same level of Slicer, but now with abilities.

"Even with all your power, it will be near an impossible task, unless you have an army."

It wasn't the first time Quinn had heard this.

"The weakness in Jim and Jack's strategy is that it relies on Sil. If you get Sil, then you can change everyone's memories back to where they were.

"That stops him from using hostages, and stops a whole load of people jumping on your back. Then you can focus on the two of them and the Dalki around them. Either way, how would you face the Dalki, without help as well?

"In the video, we saw that the Blades were transported somewhere. No doubt each one of them holds a grudge and would do anything to help you. I suggest you go find them, the only problem is I have no clue where they are. With all of this, I have helped you as much as I can, and all I can say is‚Ä¶ good luck Quinn, and I hope the next time we meet, I remember everything about you‚Ä¶ friend."

With the message over, Quinn was left a little lost about what he was to do. He looked at everyone for answers, and then turned towards Ceril in the room.
