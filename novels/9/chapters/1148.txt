Chapter 1149 Is he Cheating?

’I hope the soldiers went easy on the Cursed group. I don’t need any of their blood on my hands right now. Not unless we are underground and there is plausible deniability at least.’ Colonel Longblade thought as he left his office in the main base Shelter in the morning to enjoy the nice day.

’Besides, I should even thank them for getting rid of Innu. I always knew his own incompetence would be the end of him one day, just never thought it would be like this. It’s a bit strange that they still haven’t made an announcement about it yet. Could there be something else going on? Although it doesn’t matter since news has already spread around this base.’

Until his scout teams returned from the tunnels to report back there was not much else to do for the military leader, so he decided to visit a certain place. One of his favourite pastimes was to head down to the AR field.

As soon as he arrived, the soldiers immediately saluted their superior and let him through to the special seating area reserved for him. It was located midway down the stands and the seat had a special red cloth with a gold outline placed on them, similar to a makeshift throne.

The surrounding seats were also free, because they all knew who the main seat belonged to, Colonel Longblade, the Mech enthusiast who spent most of his days watching battle after battle whenever he wasn’t leading any expeditions or teaching swordsmanship.

"Oh, how come Avion is down there? Did he change his mind or did one of our soldiers actually grow competent enough to be worthy of him participating again?" Longblade asked one of his favourite subordinates.

"Negative, Sir. One of the Cursed faction members has been complaining about the performance of one of our pilots, so we invited him out to the field to teach him a lesson. Due to the disrespect that was being shown we requested Avion to show off the difference between both our factions! As expected he defeated his opener swiftly!"

The man who had answered him, stood to his left, with another one to his right. These two were in charge of the AR matches which was why they knew all of the details of what was going on and they had also been the ones that pushed Fex up the list.

"That makes sense, but why did Avion just climb back into the capsule?" Longblade questioned.

The two men quickly looked at each other with worry, and finally the one to the Colonel’s right then broke the news.

"Another person from the Cursed faction has entered one of the capsules, although we have no idea how he was able to access the machine or start the match without our approval. Perhaps there is a malfunction, in any case we have already reported this problem. Nevertheless, there does not seem to be any problem with the actual equipment itself, so it should be more likely a software issue. Now that Avion has entered again, another match looks like it will soon begin." The man explained.

They half expected for Longblade to be upset, but instead he had a smile on his face. The only thing he was upset about was the fact that he hadn’t arrived earlier to have watched their best pilot school a member of the Cursed faction.

"At least I will get to witness something fun today. It’s not everyday that we witness someone as skilled as Avion fighting. It is a shame that he has no talent with abilities, so his skills aren’t so great outside the Mech, but inside the machine he is a combat genius. Someone like him can only truly be appreciated here." Longblade mused.

The countdown for the match was about to begin, as Logan and Avion both got into their mechs. There were those that were supporting Logan who were a little nervous. While the soldiers had no worry at all. They thought the small child must have just gotten out of school. Piloting the mech required a great deal of physical strength as well, as one would get hit and injured. Stopping suddenly and moving about one would have to take the massive amounts of g-force that went with it.

Which was why they just couldn’t imagine someone like Logan fairing well.

"Doesn’t it take a lot of skill to pilot a mech?" Shiro asked. "I mean, I know Logan is great with technology but you have to know how to fight in them."

"That shouldn’t be any problem." Quinn replied confidently. "Logan has his own unique ways of dealing with things sometimes. Don’t forget he’s a man of probability, so he wouldn’t have gotten in that Mech if he wasn’t convinced he could beat the other guy and get some revenge for Fex."

The match began and immediately the two of them started to run forward with their Mechs. Both of them dodged in and out of the trees.

’Now what would be the best method to crush someone of his caliber?’ Logan deliberated. ’Should I beat him in a skill competition? With my ability I could ask the Mech to battle on its own, but he should be too skilled to be easily beaten. Which means there is only one sure way to win.’

So far the movements from either side had been cautious. There had been a few shots of energy blasts fired here and there, but the only targets hit had been the trees.

’This person’s movement is a lot better than the last one.’ Avion judged. ’But, when it comes to combat, no one is better than me.’

Just then, the Earthborn pilot spotted Logan running towards him with his Mech. It was a direct path where trees weren’t going to help any time soon.

’Got you.’ Avion thought as he raised his hand, and was ready to fire out a blast, but then something strange had occurred. His hand lit up, but it felt like something was off.

’Shouldn’t it have fired by now?’ Avion was confused. He knew Mech’s better than anyone else from his peers. It should be impossible for him to make such an amateur mistake as to misjudge the timing.

Before he knew it, Logan’s Mech had dashed forward and was directly in front of him, knocking the hand away so the resulting blast fired off, hitting just a branch in one of the trees. Next a leg was coming to kick it’s body, but Avion was prepared for this. He was ready to use his thrusters to reposition himself.

However, once again, his timing was off, allowing Logan’s kick to connect and damage the outer hull.

"What’s going on? Avion’s getting slaughtered out there!"

"Did you see how fast that Mech moved? Since then do thrusters activate that fast?"

Although It was unnoticeable for those in the crowd, it wasn’t unnoticeable to Avion’s mind and body. He had practised in the Mech to perfect the timing to the point where he felt like his body was actually in sync with the Mech was suffering because it was currently out of sync.

’The one sure way to beat you...’ Logan thought as he lifted out both his hands, they started to light up. Getting off the ground, Avion quickly moved his Mech behind a large tree to take cover. ’... is to use my powers.’

With that he shot out a blast with both of his hands, aiming right for the tree. Of course. Avion had played the game 1000’s of times so he knew that this tree would be able to block the energy blasts. When it hit, the tree broke and the blast hit Avion’ Mech right in the chest.

’What, but that’s impossible, the tree should have blocked the hit!’

However, the attack hadn’t stopped there as it started melting through the metal and eventually the notification screen was seen ending the match right there and then.

"What just happened? I’ve never seen anyone do that with an energy blast before! Did he finish the person off with just one enemy blast attack? Is that really possible?"

"I’ve seen Mechs get hit countless times by blasts. Even in the chest but it’s never ended the match like that, but it has to be something the game is cable off. PErhaps there are things we don’t even know about them?" VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

What they didn’t realise was that Logan Green was the creator of the game. With his powers he was able to do whatever he wished. If he wanted to modify the thrusters and grant them a quicker launch time, then he could. If he wanted to amplify the power of his blast then that was no problem as well.

Lastly, if he wanted to alter his opponents Mech, he could do that as well.

"Did Avion just lose? I never thought I would see something like that, and the other guy didn’t even seem like he was trying that hard!"

"Who is that kid? Could it be that the Cursed faction had some legendary pilot we never heard of before in their midst?"

The crowd was left stunned, as they never expected the match to have one that way.

’At the end of the day, this is just a game and we do everything we can to win. In the real world it will be the same.’ Logan thought to himself, as he left the VR capsule.

’I think that last move made it a little too obvious that you didn’t really play fair.’ Quinn was slightly worried.

Standing up from the crowd was Longblade. As the Mech enthusiast he was, he knew exactly what those machines should and shouldn’t be able to do. He had never heard of such functions. Walking down from the stage, the military leader entered the arena, before Logan could leave, and now the two of them stood in front of each other.

"Do you really think you could fool me?" Longblade asked. "Why don’t we see if you can do that same trick again, but in a real battle?"

He had his hand ready to pull out his sword, yet it was more of a threat since he never expected Logan to accept in the first place. When trying to pull it out to further intimidate, it felt like it was stuck.

Turning around, he could see an insignificant young man. He had seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the arena floor, and held the sword’s shaft from behind.

"I’m sorry but I don’t like it when people draw a weapon on my friends."
