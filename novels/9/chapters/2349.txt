Both Edvard and Hikel couldn't help but stare at the armour. It was glistening with such power that it had a hypnotising effect of not letting one take their eyes away. The two had seen it before, from far away when he was battling against Ray, but now they were able to see it up close. 

"Do you think you will really need to use that armour?" Edvard asked, thinking that Quinn was plenty strong enough already. 

"It's a precaution, we don't know what will come out of there, and how soon that could change everything." Quinn said. 

He wasted no time, as he kicked the air and his own body started to rise. Of course, Quinn could create wings out of shadow blood aura or use another set of beast equipment but the god slayer boots were best as it didn't affect his speed. 

He was quickly running up in the sky, and his first target was in sight. Quinn could see the large bat-like creature covered in black skin. It had a large head like that of a lion, while its wings and body structure was relatively thick, making it hard to believe that it was even able to fly in the first place. 

The end of Quinn's golden gauntlet started to light up, filling with power, as he threw it out, a large blood fist went right through the air. By the time the creature realised an attack was coming its way and turned around, it was hit right in the centre. 

The fist of power exploded going through its chest and killed the creature instantly, tuning it into particles of dust. 

'The way… that creature just died, it's the same way as vampires do when they have been in the sun for too long.'

[Regular demon blood has been absorbed]

[Your blood aura has already evolved.]

[There will be no effects granted]

The blood fist that Quinn had used was the blood forest fist. Which allowed him to absorb some of the opponent's blood that he attacked. Before he had used a blood bullet on one of these creatures that had come out from the portal. 

When he had done so, the message stating he had absorbed blood from a demon appeared and it allowed his blood aura to increase in power, to be far stronger than any other vampire in terms of just blood aura.

Yet, there was no effect this time, what he did make note of though was that just like last time, there were different levels of demons. 

'I've gotten a lot stronger though, with the God Slayer tier armour set, just one blood fist is enough to defeat a demon who was considered extremely strong.' Quinn thought. 

Just as he had this thought, when looking up, he could see a whole fleet of the same type of creature pouring out from the portal. It was like a group of bats. They flew through the air and their wings created an ear piercing noise along with their mouth as they flew down into the world. 

Immediately, one of them came towards Quinn, spinning his body, he avoided a quick bite attack. Swinging his leg back, he kicked down hard, right at the neck of the beast, breaking its bones in an instant and sending it hurling into the sea.

Another was right in front of Quinn's face with its mouth open wide, but it was met with Quinn's fist instead. It shattered all of its teeth and its head crunched up into its body as it was sent off far into the distance. 

'If there is one thing these demons do have, it seems like they have no fear. Even though I can deal with them easily, seeing their friends and allies killed like that, they're still coming at me with no hesitation. 

'Not even beasts act like this, they have some sense.'

The swarm of giant bat like creatures though, started to become a problem as well, as he could see they were spreading out. Seeing how some had come towards Quinn, they others were now heading out and spreading through the sky. 

Who knew what complications it would have if creatures from another world started to mix in with theirs, and some had even spotted the ship that Logan and Agent 4 were inside of. 

"I need to deal with them all at once!" Quinn thought, as he kicked the air and turned back to look at the portal above him. HIs hands started to glow, and his two hands had turned into 6 in total. 

[Blood fist barrage]

Swinging all six of his fists, Quinn let out fierce blood bullets into the portal, they were raining upward into the sky like bullets, and they were taking out the bat creatures like bullets as well. 

As they pierced their vitals, they were disappearing one after the other, the sky was clearing up, but he knew the longer the portal would stretch open, the more dangerous beings would start to come through. 

"The ground needs to be cleared quicker for a safe landing, once they clear the area, we need to work on the portal straight away. I don't know how much time we have." Agent 4 declared. 

———

As soon as Quinn had left to deal with the portal up above, there was a part of the vampire original leaders that had hoped that it would stop Jessica from using her powers. 

But it seemed that she had already gotten whatever it was she needed to now power the portal. So even if they weren't there, Jessica's power would continue to run rampant. 

The reason why this was clear, was because all of the vampires that had been used to power Jessica before and were standing in certain places, were moving, and specifically they were taking on the three of them below. 

Both Edvard and Hikel placed their hands down on the ground, creating a blood barrier. A flurry of blood swipes had come right at the three of them. 

"Don't underestimate us originals so much." Edvard smiled. 

Although there were so many blood swipes coming from so many strong vampires, they were still able to block them using their own blood aura. 

"These people, they would have shaken in fear in the past if they knew who they were going up against, and now they're just willingly attacking us." Edvard complained. 

"It seems we need to stop living in the past." Hikel stated. "Regardless, if we are just creating this barrier, then our power will slowly drain away. It looks like Magnus is staying by Jessica's side, in case we try to do anything to her." 

"Well, I guess there is an easy way to stop this, I mean if we killed Jessica that would be the end of this all, but of course Quinn would never allow us to do that." Edvard said. "And I am a lot more scared of him than I am of Immortui." 

"Let me deal with the others." Andy said from behind. "I will deal with all the vampires that are in the area, the two of you will need to deal with Magnus. I already lost to him, I know I am not strong enough to beat him. 

"He is one with many tricks, so I believe that there might be the need for the two of you. Trust me." Andy said, a strong determination in his eyes, and having pulled his great sword ready for a fight. 

"Alright new guy, show us what you got, clear a way for us, so we can get straight to Magnus." Edvard said. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As soon as Andy heard those words, he jumped up high in the air, with his string attached to his large great sword he swung it behind him dangling in place, and then swung it over his head.

It was almost as if his large great sword was on a type of chain. It crashed into the metal ground and surprisingly only left a scratch, it was made of a strong metal that was for sure. 

Stil, the impact of the attack caused blood aura to swoop down the middle and rise like a tidal wave, disrupting the vampires from their attack. As soon as Andy landed on the floor in front of them, he swung the great sword. 

It crashed, hitting many of the vampires right in their side. The strength was far too much for them to handle, and they were lucky that Andy was using the back of the blade, otherwise they would have been split in half.

While all of the commotion was going on, and with the vampires more split up and further apart, both Edvard and Hikel ran forward, while running Hikel decided to aid Andy just a bit, as he threw his blood to the other side, and his blood exploded sending the vampires flying away. 

They soon stopped as they had reached the centre of the arena, now in front of them, there was Magnus and Jessica right there. 

"You will not get the best of me!" Magnus said, as his body was transforming into its celestial form, using the power that had been given to him by Immortui. 

"The kid did his job, so we need to do ours now." Edvard said with a smile.
