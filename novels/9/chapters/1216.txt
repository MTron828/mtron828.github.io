Chapter 1217 The impossible ques

Although the new Supreme commander Sach was currently staying at the snow-filled Shelter along with Head general Samantha, he had yet to leave such a place because they knew that One Horn was present on the planet.

Their forces had suffered a few skirmishes here and there, but the Dalki still hadn't managed to get past the first trench that had been created by the group. Since the V now were no longer present within the army, Samantha's tactics on defence were working far better.

They had reinforced their defences, moving slowly, gaining territory further and further away from the land. The close combat ability users would be present in the trenches that were now covered in snow. Making it harder for the Dalki to pinpoint where they were.

Traps could be cleverly implemented, and this time, no one would be informing the enemy side.

At the same time, towers with far ranged ability users were scouting to spot the Dalki before they arrived. Before, Samantha's goal was trying to get rid of the mothership or the base that the Dalki was trying to set up.

However, after learning of One Horn, they decided that the slower approach was best.

Sitting in his makeshift office was Sach, who was getting reports after reports.

"Quinn, what the hell are you doing that is allowing you to take down the motherships so quickly? " Sach wondered. Despite asking the faction leaders what had occurred, it sounded like they didn't know much, and even worse, Sach could see that the Cursed faction ship was still in trouble.

'Two planets have been evacuated so far from the Earthborn group, but I told them to detour to planet Kimbar since One Horn is here. It's a good thing that the Cursed faction sent us their two army groups, but once the evacuation is done, what to do next?'

This was what Sach was struggling with because rather than looking at individual battles, Sach was still trying to look at the war as a whole. After the Dalki had attacked, they had gotten more information on the entire situation. Vissit nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for ùíèew ùíèovels

The Dalki had enough Motherships to send one to every single planet that the Earth owned. It had come as quite the surprise to him that the Dalki had this many forces, but still, the humans were outnumbering them ten thousand to one, not that it meant much in the first place.

Because there just weren't many humans that were strong enough to outnumber the Dalki.

'It might be best to send Nathan and the other group to attack the Dalki planets just like they had done ours. Their forces could be spread thin, and it might get them to split up. If they aren't expecting it, we can blitz the planets and move out, easing the pressure on our own forces. Or there is another option.

'Why is One Horn even here in the first place?' Sach was thinking about the planet where he had confronted One Horn with the others. 'Oscar had told us to attack the planet that belonged to the Earthborn group because he was afraid they might use it to attack us in the future. We are in a severe situation now, yet there has been no action from that planet at all. On top of that, if One Horn is here, it means that he isn't there either.

'Maybe, sending Nathan there might be the best thing, and we can find out why the Dalki find that place so important in the first place.'

He still hadn't made up his mind, but what Sach had to keep in mind was even if they successfully defended their planets from this current attack and got rid of the Dalki mother ships, the war wasn't over because there was still the Dalki planets themselves remaining, and thinking about this, he still had no clear way of just how they were going to win this war.

Planet Ortun was a dark planet where the ground was primarily black. It had a challenging environment where part of the ground would spew up hot molten lava at times. It wasn't the best place for humans to live in, but the setting did encourage strong beasts to roam, which was why it was an important planet for the Cursed faction.

Arriving at the Shelter and meeting up with Weevil and Linda, Quinn was surprised at how small it was, but this was most likely due to the environment. It was one of the few places where no such civilians lived, and the only people that were there were high-level travellers.

"I heard about this place, but it's so far out I never visited here," Iree said, as she saw what looked like a giant volcano in the distance erupt, it spewed lava down its sides, and smoke could be seen rising from the top.

"The Shelter is on the small side. I think only around two hundred or so Travelers actually live here." Yag added. "It seems like the Shelter wasn't attacked at all. Even the Dalki will have a hard time travelling on this terrain."

Quinn wasn't sure about that one, even more so since using the Dlaki's body, he was coming to learn just how resistant their hard scales were. It was no wonder that bullets of the past were unable to penetrate their problematic skin.

'If the Dalki aren't attacking the Shelter, it might be best if I come with you Quinn for this one like the first planet. After all, you know how much we struggled on the last one." Vincent suggested.

It was true, the Dalki were catching on to Quinn's plans, and there was a good chance that they would have increased the defences on the ship itself, so the plan that he had implemented so far wouldn't work out this time.

'You have a point, then I think what we should try and do is get our third slot back. It could be a big help to us in the end.'

With that agreed by the two of them, they were soon off searching the unforgivable land for the Dalki. At the moment, Quinn was in complete control of his body, and he was trying his best to control both of the Dalki more accurately.

Soon they came across a strange giant caterpillar creature. Its body looked like it was made of fur, but Quinn thought that was impossible as it had seen it crawl over a small stream of hot lava without it catching fire or burning. It was also difficult to see since its fur looked to be camouflaged similarly to the ground it was on.

This was the perfect test for Quinn. He controlled the two Dalki, moving them to defeat the king tier beast. While being a puppet master of one, Quinn was noticing something interesting from the other. Although he had just given it simple commands, it seemed to now be fighting in a different style to what it had done before.

Before, it was fighting similar to how the Dalki would fight on their born natural instincts, but now the Dalki was using the skills Quinn knew known as Muay baron. Soon Quinn had defeated the beast with the Dalki and had obtained its crystal.

'There fighting techniques are evolving as I use them more and more. They are no longer just a normal one spiked Dalki. I wonder if this information is permanent or if they die, they have to learn the skills all over again as I get a new Marked?' Quinn thought.

Thinking about evolving, he also thought about something else. The first Dalki Quinn had defeated on the mother ship said. That Dalki said they grew from hard battles. Growing in strength, breaking down and healing again.

Did it mean that it was also possible for Quinn to grow the Marked Dalki that he controlled? If so, there would be no need for him to try and waste time getting a two spiked Dalki. He could just evolve his own.

It was an interesting thought that could help Quinn in the future, but now wasn't the time. Continuing to head towards the giant mothership in the sky, Quinn had come across his first set of Dalki that were out roaming about. It looked like they were currently having trouble facing off against beasts that naturally roamed the planet as well.

'I guess the beasts from the other planets had stayed clear of them, but these ones are a little different to the usual.' Quinn gathered.

Finding the right time, Quinn went in to deal with them along with his two Dalki. He was getting used to the right amount of energy he needed to supply them with to efficiently deal with an opponent in equal strength. However, now that they were learning his fighting skills, they could still fight other Dalki with even less borrowed energy from Quinn.

Lastly, they had captured the last Dalki and had unlocked the third slot. So far, the process of marking a Dalki had been a strange one. He was unlucky at first, being successful on his third try. Still, sometimes it would take him five times. Sometimes he would be successful on his first go, which made it hard for Quinn to exactly know the odds of capturing a Dalki or if he had just been unlucky or lucky.

However, soon he had obtained his third Dalki once again.

"Alright, It's time to head to the mothership again. We'll do this one together, Vincent." Quinn said, but just before he was about to leave, a disastrous message had appeared in front of him, updating him about the quest.

[7/10 Cursed planets have been taken over]

[8/10 Cursed planets have been taken over]

[9/10 Cursed planets have been taken over]

Quinn couldn't believe his eyes, despite everything he had done, it looked like his quest might still fail after all.
