The presence of the demon tier beasts suggested that the two vampires who commanded them would also be nearby. For some reason, the shadow beasts obeyed them. Although Geo was grateful for the help, having all their strength concentrated in one place worried him. All the powerhouses in the Amra army that had been stopping the vampires from advancing were now gathered together.

This just meant that what they now needed to do, was just that more important, they needed to move on from where they were.

'We have to deal with these two quickly and finish them off.'

Geo prepared to fight again. He had witnessed the strength of one opponent but had no idea how strong the other was. Knowing the power of one of the attackers on the tower, he guessed that it had to be the other man standing next to him.

Wasting no time, he charged forward, with the Owl beast flying by his side, Geo had more of abust of power, making him go slightly ahead.

"You, take care of the newcomer that arrived," Chris instructed, rushing forward without giving Peter a chance to reply. "This one looks more interesting to me."

As Chris began to transform his body, he knew he couldn't take any chances with his opponent. With his clawed hand, he aimed a powerful swipe at Geo, who had leaped forward with the help of his strong legs. One arm clashed with the claw, and Geo nearly collapsed from the force, feeling his body give way as he was pushed to the floor. Using the strength of his legs once more, he sprang up and used his other arm to counter and push up.

'I thought the last one was strong, but this one... I might be going crazy, but I feel like his strength is even stronger.'

It wasn't just the physical strength but another power that Geo was unused to.

Unable to match Chris's power, Geo swung his arms away, evading the attack. Chris's strike continued forward, breaking the ground and leaving a large claw mark underneath. While pulling away, Geo twisted his body, launching a double hook at Chris's side. Chris deflected the attack with his other hand, using his powerful claws and incredible arm strength.

'I'm using the momentum of my attacks. I jumped into the first one, used the power of my legs, and the rotation of my body to give everything I have in these hits, but with a flick of his hand, he can match my power.'

Chris unleashed a cross-shaped energy claw attack. Geo had seen this before and placed both of his hands across his chest, only then realising something - the golden glow on his hands, the celestial energy given to him by Quinn, had faded.

'Was that from the block he did with his claw?' Geo wondered.

The same thing had happened when he blocked the claw strike from the tower and it was happening again now.

This time, when the claw marks struck his tough skin, they managed to pierce through it, drawing blood. Chris was about to follow up, lunging toward his opponent, but the Owl beast intervened, attacking him from the side with its sharp teeth.

It had crashed into Chris before he could do anything, and had seemingly come out of nowhere for him.

Chris realised that the beast could extend its neck and launch it like a bullet, making it difficult to anticipate. The beast's neck was now almost three times the length it was originally and it already had a pretty long neck, to begin with. He used his superior strength to widen the beast's jaw and slammed it into the ground.

'It almost felt like the punch didn't go all the way through, like I was hitting an invisible barrier,' Chris thought, noticing the lingering shadow on the beast's body. 'Was it because of this shadow? Did it take the brunt of my attack?'

Chris prepared to kill the interfering beast, but Geo intervened, crashing down on him from above with all four arms. Chris blocked the hit, but the force and weight of the attack created a crater beneath him as if a meteorite had crashed into the ground.

'If my current attacks aren't working, then I need to build more momentum!' Geo screamed, pushing harder into the ground.

After recovering from the attack from Chris, Geo jumped up into the air as high as he could, then falling down, he used the power of the gravity and his weight to swing them down into Chris.

"ARGHHH!" Chris started to scream as he was pushing back against the attack, his thighs were bulging with more strength, the large amount of Qi in his body was growing, and his chest was increasing in size as he went to transform his body even more than before.

With his arms he opened them, breaking open all Geo's arms and kicked him right in the stomach to send him flying back, another attack came from the beast, but this time Chris had slammed the top of its jaw shut and lifted the whole beast into the air slamming it into the ground.

Huffing and panting after using that much energy, he needed to recover a bit. The strange energy produced by the beast, and the strange energy of the golden arms, it was taking a lot of power for Chris to get through, but he had yet to be seriously injured in the fight.

The bite marks he had received on his hand had already healed, one of the traits of his werewolf body.

Turning his head, he glanced to see how Peter was doing. There were vine-like structures going everywhere trying to get him. His head tail was slashing through and breaking a lot of the vines, but eventually he would be tied up by the leg or the arm, and the vines continued, almost holding Peter in place.

Just like with Chris, although Peter's head tail could cut through the vines coming at him, his attacks felt weaker, almost pushed back against at the last moment. Now it almost looked like Peter was unable to move, and Nock took this opportunity as he pushed off the ground, jumping forward and swinging out his arms.

"If you thought something like this could hold me back, then you're wrong!" Peter shouted as he forced himself forward, moving his legs to rip the vines apart and throwing out a punch.

With his head tail, he had knocked away Nock's fist and then delivered a punch clean on his head. Before Nock's body flew away, Peter grabbed one of his arms, pulling him forward and hitting him on the head again, lifting his back feet off the floor and causing the Arma's whole body to fall to the ground.

The head tail wrapped around his fist once more. The vines still tried to grab and restrict him, but Peter didn't care; he knew they weren't enough to stop his strength.

'Damn it... I knew I wasn't strong compared to Geo, but now there are these aliens out here as well with this much strength... if I die, can we really win?' Nock thought.

He had been badly hurt, blood dripping from his mouth, but more than anything, he was disappointed he was unable to get one hit on Peter.

Lifting his fist up, Peter went to finish his opponent, until he felt a sharp energy from the front.

"What the..."

A spear slammed right into Peter's stomach, ripping a hole right through it, and it continued to spin while stuck in his body. Using his hands, Peter held onto the spear that was now in his stomach, and managed to stop it, but not before it ripped part of the flesh from his skin.

"This weapon... is it a demon-tier weapon?" Peter guessed from the strength.

Looking at the direction of where the spear had come from, a single man was walking casually as if there wasn't a care in the world.

"It looks like I've been dragged into this as well," the man said. "But that is no surprise because where there is a war, I am always there... most of the time. But you see, my power comes from war, and when there is war going on, I'm at my strongest."

Geo and Nock looked at this man, but they didn't recognize him at all. Why would a stranger to them all help them in the middle of all this, and who was he?
