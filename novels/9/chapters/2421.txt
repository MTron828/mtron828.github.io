Sitting on the ground, Quinn was soaked in blood from head to toe. A lot of it had dripped off from his body, while some of it had dried on him. All of this just added to the deadly scene that surrounded Quinn. 

For one, the blood that had hardened, piercing the Durum demons through their bodies, was still in the same shape and position, looking partially like a forest.  There were still dead bodies on the ground.

If one was to take a picture right now, it would certainly be a sight that would give one nightmares.

Slowly, Anon, Ekeke and Tuni were walking through the field of the dead. They were trying to make their way to Calva who had stopped just shy of around twenty metres away from where Quinn was. 

A lot of the Skullys had decided to stay in the forest observing what was going on, while some thought this was their chance, maybe they could escape and run back to their village now that the Durum demons had been defeated and now that Quinn wasn't so crazy anymore. 

After seeing Anon and the others safely move, they thought it was their chance to do the same as well. 

Ekeke looked at one of the moon crescent blood trees, as he had named them in his head, that was next to him to his right.

"Is this thing made of blood?" Ekeke said, reaching out, almost touching it. "How can it be so hard and sharp, and why hasn't it turned back to blood?" 

Anon grabbed Ekeke's hand before he touched the outside of the crystal. 

"We don't know what that will do if you touch it. Your curiosity will be the death of you. Don't die now, after everything we've been through, over something so stupid." 

When Anon put it like that, Ekeke did feel a bit dumb in his actions. 

"What I'm more concerned about is why hasn't Quinn moved?" Tuni asked.  Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He had been in the same position. They had no clue, since the system wasn't visible to them, what was going through his mind at the moment. Continuing forward they had just about reached where Calva was standing. 

In the past, none of them could ever imagine being so close to the champion, especially after what they had heard Calva had done. After seeing his actions today, they couldn't help but feel that the rumours and the stories that were said about him, were untrue.

While thinking this, Anon saw something that made his eyes bulge. Quinn had lifted his head, and as if it was a knee jerk reaction, Calva had acted as well. A spear was made from Calva's forearm, and it was in his hands only for a moment before it was hurled at Quinn. 

"Noo! What are you doing!" Anon shouted. 

It felt like everything was moving in slow motion for Anon. After meeting Quinn, after a demon king had finally been defeated, and now a champion was in front of them, he felt like it was the making of a change that was going to happen in their world.

The spear that had been hurled through the air, was the same one that had been chucked at Quinn when he was in his demon form. It had the same amount of power as it did before, there was no holding back from Calva. 

Quinn moved his hand to the spear that was in front of him.

'One of the other downsides of using the demon form, as tested before, is that when used, my blood aura is completely drained. Which is why, it was only ever meant to be used if it was a desperate situation, as a last resort!'

The shadow started to cover Quinn's hand, not just one of them but two. It was a thick coating of the shadow, and he had raised both of them.

Opening up his hand, a small shadow portal had been created, one that was just big enough for the spear to go into. As it entered one of Quinn's shadows, it was seen coming out from his other hand. 

The spear had been redirected, but rather than back at Calva it was shot up in the air, going through the clouds and disappearing into the red sky.

"What are you doing Calva! Quinn is no longer in his demon form, why would you attack him!" Anon shouted. 

"Why wouldn't I?" Calva replied. "He is a demon, he is a creation of Immortui and you saw what he had just done to us. He might be sane in his mind right now, but it won't mean he always will be. I know nothing about this person, to me, this is just a fight that happened between demons." 

Quinn still had his shadow power he could use, and the natural strength of his body, but without his armour, and his blood powers, would he be able to take on one of these champions?

It was why, in making a split decision and looking at the Skullys that were with him, he had decided not to attack the Champion, doing his best to avoid a fight, while he was at his weakest. 

Thankfully it looked like Calva was having second thoughts as well after seeing what had happened. 

'I wonder… does he still have the strength to beat me, even in his current situation?' Calva thought. 

"Quinn!" Anon shouted. "When we first met, you said that you were here to defeat Immortui. Originally, I thought you were just shouting some crazy stuff, but what you said, is that true!"

Quinn stood up from his position on his own two feet, the shadow was still covering both of his hands, he needed to be ready for whatever was going to happen next. 

"I only wish to finish Immortui." Quinn claimed. "I have no problem with anyone else in this world, but if anyone is to get in my way, then I will get rid of them as well."

His eyes, the lack of hesitation in his voice. Calva could tell these words were true. 

"I won't get in your way." Calva answered. "However, for me, if you are killing us inhabitants, or all of us die in the process of you achieving your goal, then you are something that needs to be dealt with as well."

Anon actually understood what Calva was saying, after seeing what had happened to them, who wouldn't be scared and worried. 

"Quinn, do you remember what I said before!" Anon shouted. "If we work together, with the champions we can do this! What happened just now, with you turning into that thing. Is there no way to stop it?"

If there was, then perhaps it was a way for him to convince Calva to not fight with Quinn. Because if the two of them did fight, then it was quite possibly the worst outcome would come out of it, ending up with them both being killed. 

"There might be a way." Quinn eventually answered. "The other demon kings… their blood." 

Quinn didn't know how to go into detail, or what to say to make them believe him. If he could avoid a fight it would be best, so he wanted to explain, but would they believe him. While struggling to think, both Calva and Quinn turned their heads to the skies. 

A large thick cloud of red smoke, darker than what was in the air, was seen out in space, and was heading for the planet. 

"Immortui… he's here." Calva said.
