Chapter 1046 - Working together

The group were travelling in a medium sized ship towards their destination. The planet was owned by the Graylash family so they didn’t have a teleporter on board. Of course, they could have traveled to a closer planet owned by the Graylash family and teleported from there, but at the moment most of the factions were traveling using space sh.i.p.s.

This was apparent just on their journey, nearly every planet they went by had large forces of sh.i.p.s protecting them, ready to act on a moment’s notice. This was actually advice given by Oscar. After not being able to use teleporters on planet Caladi, they feared that the Dalki now had some sort of teleportation jamming device.

With the information Sam knew, knowing that the vampires had the same type of technology, and one of the great vampire minds was working with the Dalki, there was a good chance this was true. Sam took this more as a fact rather than a guess, and told everyone to start using sh.i.p.s more rather than the teleporters.

"It looks like we’re nearly here." Linda said.

Looking out the window, they could see a large space ship nearly as big as the Bertha the Cursed faction used, if not bigger. It was a strange design making it look more like a floating island. Not fast moving but looked impenetrabile at the same time, a place suited more for defensive measures than anything.

It was quite the distance away, so it was hard to get a scale of the actual size of the thing, but even though it wasn’t near the planet they were going to, they could see it off in the distance.

"What’s that thing?" Peter asked.

"That’s the Graylash family’s main ship. It looks a bit odd right. It looks like a city with temples built on top of it. I actually heard that it was an island that was part of earth, and it used to be placed there. I guess Sam was right that there worried that an attack might happen." Linda replied.

"The Graylash family, that Owen is certainly an interesting character." Eno commented from the back of the ship. Currently, he wasn’t looking like his usual self. His face was by far younger, a young middle aged man, he had changed his hair to a dark blue and his moustache was no longer there either. The only thing that was similar was his ponytail hairstyle.

"Out of curiosity, was the Graylash family never an option. I know Owen is strong, couldn’t he and his people get stronger with your help though?" Quinn asked.

"Ah yes, the Graylash family is an interesting one. As you may know with each of the families I have aided them for a long time, to the point where they are today. Even that damn Trudream you seem to hate so much, but as for the Graylash family, I didn’t play a part in it at all.

"They have since the beginning naturally evolved on their own. I still don’t think they will be enough, but it is one of the families where my influence would have not helped at all."

Taking those words in, Owen did always seem like a strange character but at the same time never a threat to Quinn. Although there was one thing troubling him when they fought against Hilston together.

’Why didn’t he use his soul weapon back then, even though we were in such a serious situation?’

Finally, the ship was preparing to enter the planet’s atmosphere. From the outside it looked to be green in colour. The water seemed to reflect this, shining in the same way. As they got closer, giant strange plants that were all sorts of strange colours started to appear in their view.

Purple, red, yellow, while the ground was covered in tall brown grass that looked as if it was almost dying. There were sh.i.p.s stationed outside the planet as well, but an access code had been granted and the others knew that the cursed faction were arriving.

Finally, after descending and flying for a short while longer, they came across the shelter. The outside of the shelter was similar to ones they had seen before. With a large reinforced wall on the outside.

Only, on the wall there were far more faction members and mechs than usual, and direct members of the Graylash family could be seen standing on part of the walls. With this shelter, it seemed like they were unable to avoid some of the plantation or there were reasons as to why they couldn’t cut them down, so it was built partly into the shelter.

Quinn thought it looked quite nice, as some of the shelters were plain looking, but here there was a large pink tree in the centre with purple leaves fluttering about in this one. The size and equipment of the shelter classified it as a Rank A shelter.

It was placed on an orange portal planet. Only strong factions and Travellers would be able to venture out to hunt beasts. Although the Shelter wasn’t the largest one they had come across, there seemed to be a good population living here, over ten thousand or so people.

Off to the side, there was a large field that was used for sh.i.p.s to land, and there were already quite a few there, as well as a group of people ready to greet them.

"Welcome Quinn, I believe we met before while you were working at the school." One of the men in white robes said walking forward. "It’s also nice to see you again." The man smiled.

When Sil looked up, it took him a few seconds but he really did know this person. This was Robin Graylash. One of the head generals that had been invited to do a little demonstration in one of the elemental classes.

From Quinn’s duties he had met the other head generals from time to time, but didn’t talk with them much. The two of them shook hands and smiled at each other.

"I see the Graylash family didn’t just send anybody in either. It will be great to have your support." Quinn said.

While those from the Graylash family were respectful to Quinn and seemed to be happy to see him, the other five Travelers that had been brought along with him weren’t exactly welcoming him with open arms. Although they knew their place and soon came over giving a bow down.

"These people are from the Orbus faction that was stationed here." Robin explained. "They work for the Graylash family and will be the ones looking after us while we are in the shelter."

All of the men had bowed down to Quinn to greet the world leader, apart from one. A young man who had his arms crossed and bags under his eyes as if he had been having many sleepless nights.

"Please allow me to say what’s on my mind, sir." The man said, looking at Quinn.

He still wasn’t used to this, but now as one of the world leaders, he realised that others couldn’t just say what they wanted to him, unless they wished to start a war.

"I hope you won’t go back on your word and I am free to say what I want. I am Ko, leader of the Orbus faction. However, I don’t like the fact that the Cursed faction seem to be having so much free time that even a world leader is able to come down here.

"I feel like this is just putting pressure on the Graylash family to hand over the beast crystal to you once it has been obtained. At the same time, you are a person younger than myself, and you are meant to take command?

"At your age, how many battles have you fought In? Do you even know how to lead or do you just rely on others around you."

As the man continued, Quinn could see that a temper was rising in Robin, it almost looked like he was going to zapp the man to stop him, but Quinn nodded in his direction when the two of them made eye contact. It was okay, this man just didn’t understand and people shouldn’t be punished because they had different views or thoughts.

"On top of that, I have heard about your unhanded methods, summoning beasts on the other Shelters. If things don’t go your way, will you be doing it he-" Ko’s speech had stopped while he was in the middle of talking. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

While Quinn had made sure Robin was not to get involved, he had forgotten about another person, who currently had his hand wrapped around Ko’s mouth holding his jaw in place so he couldn’t say another word.

"Don’t you think it just got a bit quiet around here?" Peter said, smiling at the other men behind him.
