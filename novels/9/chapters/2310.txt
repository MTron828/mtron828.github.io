As soon as Jared swiped his finger across his neck, Quinn had rushed forward with his fist, he threw it out breaking the solid glass container, and went to lift Jared's body up. The cut was incredibly deep on his neck, and just from holding him Quinn could tell. 

There was no heartbeat, no Qi energy flowing in his body anymore, he was dead and there was nothing they could do about it.

"I'm sorry Quinn, I should have put him in a place where we could restrain him, then this would have never happened." Vincent said. 

His eyes were heavy staring at Quinn's back holding onto the boy.

"It's not your fault, Vincent. We never knew Immortui would attempt to do this. If he had a dedicated follower doing his bidding, then why take the life, there was no need to, other than to get to me." Quinn answered.

The room had a moment of silence for Jared, both Hikel and Edvard didn't say anything, but standing up with Jared still in his hands Quinn knew he had to act, they didn't have a lot of time. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

"Report everything that happened here to both Zinon and Logan. They need to be kept up to date with everything that's going on. Also tell them to note anything that is suspicious, a rise in deaths, any strange deaths, anything. 

"And I'm sorry Vincent, I'm going to have to rely on you to try to spot something. You're a bit better at this than I am." 

Vincent nodded and was already working away. Their enemy was only a single person, but it was a powerful god, and the only way they could get ahead of him or stop his plans was to use everybody. 

Just as Immortui stated, Quinn coulnd't be everywhere at once, so he needed to use his allies' help. 

There were some major problems though, they knew Magnus was marked but that was all. It was possible that Magnus was able to mark others as well, just like he had done Jared, so there was no telling how many actually were marked. 

On top of that, even though Immortui had been stuck in the other plane, he was still somehow able to mark those on this side. Laxmus and Magnus could be explained, maybe a connection was formed when they were first turned, one deeper compared to the others. 

Something Immortui saw in them that he could exploit, but as for those after, he had no idea. So Quinn had to go on the theory that Immortui could still mark new people as well, without physically being in this world, which made his job that much harder. 

'If he goes after those closest to me, then that would be my family.' Quinn thought. 'Minny, Galen and Layla. All three of them are together, but not all the time. Minny still goes to school.

'The safest thing to do would be to take her out of school, but would that be the best thing for her? She only just got back to school… my family only now just started enjoying their life again.'

Gritting his teeth, Quinn had to bear the pain, he felt like it was his fault that his family were unable to just enjoy their life.

'I have a plan… that should work.' Quinn thought. 'Let's see if he tries and targets Minny again.' 

"I have a suggestion to make." Edvard interrupted Quinn's thoughts. "The girl from before, Hebe. I think she should be kept under watch as well. Her and Jared seemed to be good friends. I'm sure after she hears the news all sorts of emotions will be running through her. 

"She will be an easy target to control and influence, and with her being in the school…" 

Quinn understood where he was coming from, walking over he handed over Jared to Edvard. 

"I will go and inform them… of what happened here, make sure his body is well kept, and there is a proper service for him." Quinn said. 

Both of the girls had been waiting in the reception area of the tenth family castle, they hadn't left and they refused to until Jared had come back. Soon a shadow crawled across the floor, and rising from it was Quinn. 

Minny had a big smile on her face as soon as she saw her father, but for Hebe it was different. She immediately couldn't see Jared, and took that as a bad sign and then, she spotted blood on the sleeve of Quinn's clothes. 

"What… what happend, what happened to Jared!" Hebe got up from her seat and ran over. 

"Jared was a good person, a good student, but someone was controlling him." Quinn answered. "That was why he attacked Minny, it wasn't Jared, but the one controlling him."

A deep lump was felt in Hebe's throat, and her eyes were tunnelling in on Quinn. 

"Was… why are you using the word was?" Hebe asked. 

"Because." Quinn looked at them both. "Jared is dead. The thing that was controlling him, it took over and killed him. I'm sorry, we were unable to stop it."

The horrible feeling that Hebe could feel, it exploded in that moment. For some reason, when Jared was taken away in front of her, on their way to school, she felt like it was quite possible the last time she was going to meet him. 

When she had met him, a few moments ago, that thought had gone out of her mind for a moment, but now that it was a reality she didn't know how to deal with it, 

"AHHHH!" Hebe screamed into the air, she continued to scream as tears came out of her face, and started to run right at Quinn. 

She crashed into his body, it was a hard hit but he could take it. Then with the bottom of her fist she swung them repeatedly bashing it against Quinn's chest one after another, she was even using her vampire aura she was so stunned, not realising what she was doing. 

If it was anyone else, perhaps the attacks might have hurt, but not for Quinn. He didn't say anything as he wanted her to let all of her anger out.

"Bring him back!! Bring him back!" Hebe shouted. "It's your fault… you took him away, it's your fault that he's dead. I thought you were meant to be some type of hero, someone who saved the vampire race, yet you couldn't even save one person!!!"

The screams, the shouts and the insults continued, until her hands eventually slowed down, they were just dragging along Quinn's chest now.

"I know you might not be in a state to listen to me right now." Quinn said. "And it might not be what you want to hear, but I wish to stop this from happening, to stop what happened to Jared and you, from happening to others, and due to the situation I need to say it."

Hebe continued to cry, her shoulders moving up and down so it was hard to tell if she was really listening or not.

"The dead can not come back." Quinn stated. "Once dead, they are meant to stay dead, and if anyone states otherwise, or even attempts to tell you that there is some way, then I want you to come to me immediately."

Hebe fell to her knees there and then. Of all the things to say to her, couldn't she even have the hope that he could come back. 

"You're… so cruel." Hebe whispered. 

———

In a world covered in red clouds and dusty skies, there was one that couldn't stop laughing in joy. He was excited for what was to come, and hadn't been this excited in a number of years. 

"Oh Quinn, let's see how long you manage to last, and then when you finally give up, I'll be free from this place and… even if you never choose to break me free it won't matter anyway. I will come one way or another."

"Now, where to start?"
