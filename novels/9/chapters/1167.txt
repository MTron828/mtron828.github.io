Chapter 1168 A dark mind

At the moment, Shiro was performing the most important task he had ever received in his life. He knew that everyone was relying on him before. However, now the tension seems to have risen tenfold.

’The first part of the plan worked out. Sil protected me while we were heading towards the Demi-god tier beast. Now I just have to do my part.’

Currently, he was in the black space. It was the common area in one’s mind, an area that he had been in many times before. This time the technique that needed to be performed was slightly different compared to the last.

’I’ve done it once before, but I don’t have the same powers as I did when I was using Sil’s body. I’m going to have to try and do this as quickly as possible.’

Doing it once, the second time was much easier, and as he travelled through the dark space, he could see the two floating spirits.

’Now which one should I take, and how do I know who is who, just from floating spirits?’ Shiro wondered, but there was a larger issue going on. At the moment, he was also latched onto the beast’s mind, ready to merge the two together, so they were in the same space.

Because he was currently trying to control two mind spaces, his MC cells were being drained twice as fast.

’I don’t have time to enter both spaces.’

At that moment, one of the floating orbs started to come towards him. As if it wanted to be picked more than the other. From the description of both of their personalities and having met Vorden last time, Shiro only hoped it was Vorden.

Activating a glow around his hand, he was able to grab the floating ball, and now it was time for the two of them to enter the beast’s mind. Merging both of the minds, something strange started to happen. The black space started to change as the other mind was brought in.

One half of the room was starting to form a purple colour. Its texture looked like raw meat and flesh, as it was a little bouncy and reactive to the touch.

’Why did the beast’s mind have to be so scary.’ Shiro shook his head, taking a step forward. Before switching minds with the beasts. He had experienced this before when switching the minds of the beasts. However, unlike humans, who all seemed to have a black space and a deeper white space, the beasts differed depending on what type of tier they were at.

While the human’s mind seemed like one could wander in the dark space forever, a beast’s mind was limited the lower the tier. Shiro had a theory that it might have something to do with its capacity to learn.

Judging by the size of the mind he could see now, there was plenty of space to put another human mind into it. Walking in the purple area, the floating spirit in his hand started to shine brighter. The further he walked into the other mind, the glow grew stronger until eventually, it felt like it could no longer be continued.

Shiro felt like it was a grenade ready to go off at any second. Placing it on the ground, he stepped away. The light was so bright he looked away, covering his eyes. When the flash had disappeared, and he turned to look around, he could hear someone.

"I’m finally back bitches!" The person screamed.

"Vor...Vor..Vor-" He was trying to make a guess, or more hoping this was the person he had met before.

"Please, do you think that wimp would have come forward when seeing the opportunity in front of him? If there were a hundred of us in Sil’s mind, he would be the last person to have come forward." Raten explained. "For a shrimp, you sure have an amazing power. Now come on, bring me back. This mind kinda looks disgusting." Raten lifted his feet and a purple slime followed his feat, soon snapping off. "But it will do. Why does it look like this anyway."

"Umm..." Shiro had been told Raten was a problematic character, but Shiro thought he would at least be thankful to him and would be able to communicate with him easier than others had expected, but it didn’t seem to be the case. What Shrio didn’t know, was Raten was being relatively tame because of this very reason.

In the end, Shiro explained what he was here to do and what exactly they had planned to do with his mind.

"That’s great, so I get to experience being a beast and can hit anyone I like while using my beast form as an excuse." Raten smiled. "Alright, just go and leave me here then, you can go back, and I’ll take over this mind."

Shiro didn’t move, and that’s when Raten noticed that there must have been a second part to this that hadn’t been said yet.

"The thing is, when we entered this mind, I felt it. The beast’s mind also was able to enter into its own space. So it’s inside at the moment. If I leave you here, then the beast will still have original control just like Sil did."

"Then what the heck do we do, you little brat!" Raten said, raising a fist as if he was about to punch him, but soon controlled himself and put it back down by his side.

In all honesty, Shiro really didn’t want to bring a person like this back.

’How could Still be friends with someone like this? I can’t imagine the two of them ever talking.’

"I don’t hundred percent know, but there are two things I can think of. At the moment, we have nowhere to put the beast into. We can put it into Sil’s mind, but that might cause a disturbance, so my suggestion would be, we either talk to the beast and ask it to use its bo-"

"Are you really that dumb? The beast just fought for its life against us. You think if we ask nicely with sprinkles on top, the beast is just going to let us use its body>? Then it could take over at any point and time and just attack the others even if it said yes. Nope, dumb move over to the next option."

At that moment, they could hear the sound of the goo moving. The whole room seemed to react to something. When they turned around to look, they could see that the Demi-god tier beast had arrived, and it had transformed its two hands into blades.

"The second option is we take the beast into a deeper subconscious, similar to where Oscar was. To do that, I think I have to touch it again." Shiro said. However, round two just didn’t seem like it would be as easy with Raten rather than Sil.

———

Outside there was no such talk of what needed to be done. Fex being relatively close to where Sil, Shiro and the Demi-god tier beast was decided to stay nearby. Qi infused arrows were firing off towards them, and it was his job to make sure it didn’t touch the beast.

"Come on, we’re going to steal that beast back!" Agent 2 shouted, and all of the men soon ran forward.

"Of course, when we don’t have our superhuman boy with us, all these losers decide to turn up." Fex’s face was scrunched up and annoyed because the Qi arrows were quite dangerous against him, and he had to be careful.

The soldiers were in combat with the members of Pure. As for the soldiers in the mechs knew that all they could do was stay where they currently were. Humans knew the many weaknesses of the mechs, unlike the Dalki, and they were already going up against the strongest members in the Shelter.

Without their mechs, and even with them, they were nothing compared to the others. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Where the hell is your leader!" Joy shouted as she swung her blade and slammed the ground with her foot raising up a wall of earth between them.

"I don’t know. I thought he would have been here by now. Maybe he’s caught up in something." Fex replied back.

As for Agent number two, two people stepped forward to battle with him, Longblade and Layla.

"I see you have a bow. Try to give me support as much as you can, and I will be the one to face him." Longblade said as he charged forward. He swung his large black sword, and Agent 2 swung his strange weapon as well.

The two powerful forces collided, hitting each other mid-air, but a strange reaction came from Agent 2.

"It’s nice to meet you. Judging by that ridiculous number on your back, I can see you’re a high ranking member." Longblade said. "It seems you’re a bit surprised by something. Is it perhaps that the strange power you have, isn’t working?"

That was precisely what was strange about it. Agent 2 could tell that the Qi that he had infused into his weapon wasn’t working at all. The first stage he used to power the cells in his body still worked, giving him a strong blow, but the second stage of Qi on the sword had completely disappeared.

’Is it his weapon?" Agent two thought and could soon feel the energy of an arrow coming from behind.

Stepping out of the way to avoid the arrow, he soon found it following him. The good thing was, the Qi that had gone from his sword now was able to come back.

’It looks like I was right, but I never heard of such a sword. One that can nullify the effect of Qi before.’ Striking forward at the arrow, Agent 2 was expecting to destroy it with ease. Still, there was a bit of resistance to it, until his power eventually won out, destroying the head.

"Oh, a Qi infused arrow. When did you learn to use Qi as well, little Layla?" Agent two asked, looking in their direction. Originally with him here, he thought it would be an easy fight. He had already gotten rid of one of the bigger annoyances, but it seemed like there were still a couple more annoying people he had to deal with.

’That’s strange. Why is my heart beating fast just after that, and why do I feel a little hot. I should have recovered all my Qi energy?’ Agent 2 thought as a strange feeling was coming over his body.
