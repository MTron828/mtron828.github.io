Muka had done a lot of research into the dhampirs and vampires. She was very involved for a period of time even assuming that they were behind the missing tombs.

What they had learned in the end was that Erin was one of the first to have her memories altered. How she had come in contact with Jim and Jack was unknown.

What was clear was that she had her memories altered before the attacks and since Leo and Owen were in possession of the familiar kings she had obtained these during that period of time.

"You joined with her, even though you knew that they were going against the vampires, the ones that you already made contracts with?" Muka asked with a bit of bad taste in her mouth.

"You have to understand our position." Ovinnik said. "First, contracts were only made with you vampires because of two reasons.

"One, there was an area where the link between our two worlds was strong. That happened to be on the planet where you vampires lived so we could make contracts that way.

"Second, you had a way to contact us and make contracts as well. It's not as if we chose you vampires, it just happened that you were our only option. You see, our world, as I said before, is slowly dying and what I mean by that is even the contracts we made with you vampires is not enough to save us. The energy you brought over was insufficient.

"Erin on the other hand, she had a lot of energy compared to any vampire we had ever been with before.

"Enough that even all four of us, the strongest of familiars, if attached to her would be able to pour new energy into our world."

It seemed like the theory Muka had was right. The vampires were more connected with the familiars by chance.

Dhampirs had a large amount of energy that was similar to Qi and Erin was indeed strong, but one thing was clear, looking at the state of the current world, teaming up with Erin didn't work.

"But your plan failed." Muka said. "Quinn defeated Erin, therefore there was no longer enough energy to save your world."

Ovinnik smiled when he heard this.

"Haha that's a good guess but that's not correct at all. You are correct in thinking we thought Quinn would never return.

"We never imagined him to come back and go against Erin. We were contracted with her so we were to protect her. Her death did put a large spanner in our plan but not because of what you think.

"Do you really think a single person, even if connected to us would be able to save the familiars' world? You are talking about a whole universe."

Now that Ovinnik had put it like that she did seem a bit embarrassed by saying her guess out loud.

"No, you see, our Undead king here has a great power. The power to open portals and that isn't just portals within our world but portals that can connect to other worlds.

"Such as yours. You see the plan was never to gather enough energy to restore our world but for our friend here to transport or the familiars to another world."

Muka's eyes widened, she somewhat understood but there were still a lot of things that didn't make sense so rather than guess, she would let the black cat continue on explaining.

"There are problems still even with this. From the beginning familiars can't survive in another world. Because our very core energy is still connected to ours.

"That is why even when we are in your world and are killed with no such contract, we will still form again but in our world. However, that forming can take a certain amount of time.

"The forming of energy though is due to the link that all of us familiars share. Essentially, it is what makes the familiars the way they are, and the world we are in is us ourselves.

"The world, or our world is like this because of us. As long as the main core of us manage to migrate to a new world then it will allow us to do the same here.

"Our bodies will be able to exist and just absorb the natural energy from your world without the need of contacts. So as you can see, we had no choice, we needed to come here for the survival of all of us."

Muka understood their position but still not all questions were answered.

"You said before, the link was between the old vampire world. If you wished to just migrate to us then why not do that? Why not calmly talk to us and why just attack the vampire settlement?" Muka asked. "And it better be a good reason otherwise I won't let him hold back."

Peter was really paying attention to what they were saying and was judging everything by the reaction of Muka.

He was listening to her as well, because a lot of it was going over his head.

"Remember what I said?" Ovinnik asked. "That the Boneclaw had the power to transport us to different worlds, your world was not the only one we considered.

"There is a world that we know as Zeathun, it is a world full of beings far more powerful than us familiars, even for us kings.

"We did not know that, and we sent some familiars there long ago, wishing to migrate, and in turn they had managed to send someone back to us.

"It was clear that it wasn't the option, and now in that world their is someone even stronger that rules, one named Immortui."

This name caused both Peter and Muka to react as they instinctively took a step back, the idea that the familiars were working with him was now possible.

"You see we have been in contact with Immortui, we knew of his plans and he knew that we worked with the vampires.

"He knew that we needed a world, so he wanted us to attack you, to cause a war between the two of us. If we helped him, then he would allow us to live on one of the two worlds."

Judging by what they had been through, it was pretty clear what decision they had decided to make and now Muka was trying to think of a way to get out of here.

"Calm down." Genbu added. "There is a reason why we brought both of you here, listen till the end."

"When the deal was brought to us, it was when we were still with Erin at the time. We honestly had yet to make a decision, and that was because we had learned and heard that Quinn had returned.

"The Boneclaw, having been with Quinn for a certain period of time, believed in him. If Quinn was here then he would beat Immortui so making a deal with him was pointless, it would be better to communicate with the vampires.√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

"However, we still needed the energy from Erin. What happened, when Erin had been killed there was a forming period for us.

"This time, due to the energy being weak in our world the forming period took longer than we thought. In turn, when we finally returned Quinn‚Ä¶ no one knew of him. He was nowhere to be seen or heard of.

"We thought once again he must have perished. So we felt like we had no choice, we could not go against Immortui, and he would take over your world anyway, so we had to join the winning side."

Ovinnik then jumped off from Genbu and all of them lined up in a row looking at Peter. They bowed their heads down in front of him.

"We made a mistake, we thought you were still gone. When we returned, we didn't take time to try adn find out what the current situation was, we only knw how much time had passed. Immortui, isn't exactly a patient person, and from the looks of thing's he was gearing up for an attack on earth. He contacted us again, before we could even check things, and we decided to attack, using the energy the Boneclaw has or had but now we see that you are here, we wish to work with you once more.

"We wish to help you in the battle against Immortui. In turn for our help to find a way where we can survive as well. Please Quinn, if you agree we will do everything in our power to help you!" Ovinnik said.

Now all eyes were on Peter, waiting for his answer.
