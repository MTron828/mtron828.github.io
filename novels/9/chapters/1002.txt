Chapter 1003 - Sil's anger

It was another regular school day. Although another and regular were rarely put together. With everything happening so far, a regular day seemed strange for Quinn and the gang. He had a great birthday party which he would remember for the rest of his life, but soon everyone else had left to do their regular duties.

’I guess it’s a good thing that they can work so well without me.’ Quinn thought as he reminisced about yesterday.

In the homeroom class, he noticed that the students were full of life and excited unlike before, and none of them seemed to be covered in bruises and marks. What happened to Erlen had gotten around and seeing Swin and Shiro put on a great display of skills, made the others no longer view their class as weak.

Although it wouldn’t completely get rid of the problem, all of Quinn’s actions so far had certainly helped. Still, there was one thing he was debating about and that was teaching the students Qi.

’Is it really a good idea to teach everyone it, just like abilities there are some that are talented in Qi and others that are not, it might just cause another problem.’ Quinn thought.

’You have to remember there will always be others that are better at certain things. Some kids are better at writing, while others are better at maths. This might be something that you just can’t stop. And remember, Pure might be teaching all their members soon, the military at the moment is weak.’ Vincent explained.

’Yeah, but you can’t kill someone with maths...I think. My point is if I teach these kids Qi and it gets out of hand it will be all my fault.’

It was a tough one for Quinn to figure out, he agreed with both Oscar and Vicnent’s reasonings. Everyone seemed to think it was a good idea to teach others Qi, at least for their own sake.

’Maybe I should wait to counsel Leo when he’s back, it still doesn’t feel right for me to just teach others without asking him first.’ Quinn thought.

In the school the students were currently having their lunch break, Sil with his new disguise looking like Chucky, didn’t stand out anymore. As expected it was as if he was an invisible person.

This was good for two reasons, the first, no one would attack them. Before when others learnt of Sil’s ability or thought he was a weak boy, people would try to take advantage of that, but they couldn’t even remember Sil was in their class now.

The second reason, being invisible allowed them to attempt to copy as many abilities as possible, but the ability that was needed or one they thought would help was just never found.

’This kid, he’s usually in a mood but today...’ Chucky thought.

"Hey, I don’t know much about what we are trying to do, but we will find the ability you are looking for eventually. We have Logan, who has access to all the databases. So any new abilities that are recorded he will be able to find out, and Quinn is one of the World leaders now so getting information will be easy."

Hearing this, Sil just nodded and continued to shove a small piece of bread into his mouth. Chucky’s attempt at cheering him up had failed.

A few seconds later, Shiro, Venus and Swin were seen taking the seat next to them. Ever since Sil and Chucky had saved them, they had been thankful and if they saw Chucky on his own. They would come over to sit with him, even though they didn’t know who the other person with him was.

The three boys were excited as they seemed to have earned new fame. Passing students in the hallway would talk about them all the time which was a first for all of them. After excitedly talking and boasting, they noticed the boy’s depressed mood.

"Hey, is your brother okay?" Venus asked.

"My brother?" Chucky replied back, and he noticed they were talking about Sil, since his appearance was now similar to his. "Oh yeah, he’s just upset about not getting something."

Shiro would guess based on the fact that this boy had the same demeanour as Sil, and was hanging around with Chucky, that this was Sil. He wanted to do something to cheer him up, after all, the words Sil said that day had really hit him.

’I wonder what type of life Sil lived to think like that?’ Shiro thought. When Sil looked back at him, he turned around to avoid eye contact and knocked his carton of juice on the floor. Going down to pick it up, something had gone past all the, at the table and due to Shiro ducking at a particular time the object had whacked Sil right in the face.

"What the hell happened, did someone just throw something at us?!" Venus said, looking at where the object was thrown from.

"Shiro, let’s fight again right now!" A boy shouted, from across the canteen hall. "I’m sick and tired of everyone saying I lost to you when I won. Come on, if you’re so strong we can fight right now!’ Zhen shouted.

With how students were talking about Shiro and the others, whenever they saw Zhen it was the same, but they didn’t speak positively about him and instead thought he had received a fake win. In fact, Zhen was getting paranoid over this himself. While walking around he thought he could hear everyone talking about him, lips moving into the words winner and loser, and he thought they were being directed at him.

’Haha, I didn’t even lose a fight and everyone is talking about me like this! Well fine, I know exactly what to do!’ Zhen thought, as he carried around with him, one of the practise beast balls for activating one’s ability. A large round black heavy ball. A few seconds ago, he had hurled it towards Shiro as he could see him smiling happy and smug.

Zhen had good aim, but what happened was unfortunate as Shiro had ducked down from dropping his juice box on the floor, and instead the ball had hit another. It had hit Sil who had been lost in his own world.

"Are you okay?" Shiro asked, as Sil was standing up and blood was falling to the floor, dipping from either his mouth or nose but it was hard to tell since Sil was looking at the floor. What was strange though, was Shiro could see pieces of dirt falling to the floor as well.

"Come on Shiro, fight me here and now!" Zhen continued to shout.

Those next to him tried to calm Zhen down, while Shiro was more concerned for Sil at this moment, but when he lifted his head, he took a step back slightly. For Sil’s face was disfigured, half of it seemed to be falling off, cracked from the top right and around the mouth area, where it was bleeding quite severely as a couple of his teeth were broken or made loose.

’Is it some type of mask?’ Shiro figured it out.

Sil, immediately picked up the back ball from the ground, then placed his hand on Chucky, Sil and lastly Venus as well. He walked forward and his mask started to crumble away as it would no longer work and a bloody faced Sil could now be seen.

"What the hell, are you his pet boyfriend or something, get lost? I don’t want you!" Zhen shouted.

Everyone around was taking a glance at Sil and that’s when some people started to recognize him. "Hey isn’t that the guy who managed to beat the Graylash head general in the elemental class?"

"Yeah he went missing and no one could find him."

"I think I just saw his face change."

Zhen could no longer take it and started to charge forward, but the second he did, the black ball came hurling towards him at an incredible speed and it had huge weight behind it. As it hit Zhen’s c.h.e.s.t it cracked his bones inside, and pushed him back through the air. The ball continued to move, pushing him more, his body hitting other students as he was thrown through the air, until eventually he was slammed into the wall and the black ball fell to the ground.

However, it wasn’t over yet, as Sil walked forward and used his telekinesis ability to pull Zhen from out of the wall, and bring him towards him, hovering in the air.

"People like you never learn, and now you have broken my mask!" Sil shouted. Soon Sil was pulling at each of Zhen’s limbs, as if an invisible force was stretching him. Zhen started to scream in pain, and no one wished to get close.

"SIl, you’ll kill him stop!" Shiro shouted.

"He had a chance, and now he is running more than one person’s life. If he continues to live he will just ruin more!" Sil shouted.

The teachers who were in the canteen were soon on the move. Seeing the students fighting they were attempting to jump in and stop it, but they just found themselves being hit away by several lashes of water that would appear out of nowhere.

Now all of the students were staying well clear of Sil and Zhen, and soon a big pop was heard as Zhen’s shoulder had been pulled out from his socket.

’Damn, if Sil is like this, then no one can stop him.’ Chucky thought.

"Quinn, answer me, come to the canteen straight away, something has happened with Sil, he’s out of control!"
