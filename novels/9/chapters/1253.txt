Chapter 1254 - The Origin

Although Vicky and Pai had said they would be journeying around the beast solar system to catch the dangerous Chained that had escaped. They had decided to travel with the rest of the Blade family, heading towards Blade island.

Vicky and Pai needed a place to start and somewhere they could frequent back to. Although they were strong, the Dalki were still out there, and everyone had seen their faces on camera by now. They were no longer the Unknown Blade family, so the places they could stay without causing too much trouble were practically none.

Heading to the Blade island also meant the group would be heading back to Earth. Currently, all of the Blades were on a ship heading through the teleport station. All apart from the Blade children, they had remained on the ship. They would have liked to come but were told they were not allowed. It was a dangerous place, and possibly the centre of the next fight would be there. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Usually, the giant teleport station for ships was offline during these times of war. The station needed great power to be turned on again and would take some time.. However, because Eno and Mona were heading back to Earth anyway, they were able to travel through it shortly after them.

After that, the station would be closed once again. For fear, the Dalki could use it in some way. However, since the Dalki named Dred had appeared on Earth, and the fact that the V were able to hide amongst humans, they knew there was already a way for the enemy to arrive on Earth despite this.

The ship approached Earth with relative ease. The military that was in charge of protecting Earth knew they would be arriving. Still, at the same time, there was far more security compared to the times before.

It had to be due to the warning given by Eno. Sach had gotten to work quickly.

Flying outwards to the island, they could see it off in the distance. It was a place they once all called home. Yet, it felt like hell for them all. Seeing it was brewing some odd feelings for them all.

Sil, Raten, Vorden, Vicky, Pai and finally another who had come along with them all, Borden. He was the only one that didn’t have this strange feeling in his stomach.

Mona, Eno, Brock and Dennis had already set up base on top of the large Castle on the island itself. It wasn’t too far from the giant tablet. Even on top of the Castle, one could look out and see the tablet as well as the Demon tier beast that was still resting.

"That’s those Blade kid’s Sam talked to us about, right?" Mona said, looking at the ship land in the large open space by the giant staircase leading up to the Castle.

"Yeah, he said that they would be doing their own thing. We don’t have to worry about them. Remember, they were originally raised on this island, so whatever beast they run into, they can take them on." Dennis replied as he carried a large metallic object on his back.

"Now, tell me, where do you want this thing?" Dennis asked.

"The teleporter will need to be put in a safe place," Eno said while he was looking down. "We could either place it by the tablet or inside the Castle. I’m struggling to decide what the safe option would be."

"Oh." Mona was surprised. "I thought you were someone who had everything figured out. I’m surprised to hear you’re struggling with a simple decision like this." Walking over to the edge, she went to look at what Eno had been staring at for so long. That’s when her eyes could see what he was now looking at as well.

"Now you see my struggle. I’m pretty sure that wasn’t there the last time I came here." Eno replied.

Exiting the ship, the group of Blades decided to walk up the long staircase together. Step after step, they did so slowly. Not a single one of them was running up the stairs in excitement at all.

"Come on guys, you are really slow. Do you need me to pick you up?" Borden said as he jumped up to the next step. He was no longer in his full human form compared to before, so now he was as small as a puppy climbing the stairs.

Vicky, watching this, couldn’t help but stare in fascination and thought the whole thing was a little cute.

’This little guy was the same guy that was threatening us?’ Pai thought.

"Hey, why don’t you just stay on my shoulder for the rest of the way," Vorden asked. "You don’t have to tire yourself out."

"I’m not tired, and you know I like to do things for myself. Besides, you guys are clearly worrying about other things. That Hilston guy you were all scared of is gone! So I don’t know why you are all acting like he’s still alive. This place used to belong to him, well now it’s all yours." Borden shouted back as he continued to hop up the stairs, getting ahead of everyone else.

"Damn it, how can that little runt be so right! I can’t believe I was feeling this way and hanging around with the loser bunch." Raten said as he ran ahead, catching up with Borden.

For the others, they looked at each other and smiled. Borden’s words had picked them up a little. It was just so hard to believe that Hilston was gone. Any second, when they opened those doors, they were expecting to see Hilston on the other side.

When the others had finally reached the stairs, they could see the doors wide open, but there was no ’Family’ that was there to greet them like there usually would be.

The inside of the place was empty, feeling emptier than usual.

"We came here last time, but we were unable to find anything other than a journal," Sil said. "Quinn has the journal at the moment, but other than all the ability users in that journal, it didn’t seem to have anything else inside. Do you think we’ll find anything this time?"

The reason they had come here was to perhaps learn what exactly Hilston was planning if he really was looking for a Blade with a soul weapon and why.

"Last time, you didn’t have Pai and me." Vicky proudly said, walking in front taking the lead. "You have to remember, we left with Hilston when he decided to go after you guys, and you three were young, so they didn’t exactly show you all the places in this Castle. What do you think is under the giant staircases in the first place?"

Thinking about it, although the Castle was on a type of Hill, the staircase and Castle seemed to be at a higher level than others. It was starting to make Vorden wonder, by Vicky’s words, if they were man-made.

With a strong Earth ability, one could landscape the whole area to their liking.

’Is there something underneath the castle?’ Vorden thought.

Following Vicky, she had eventually led them to one of the training rooms they all remembered well. Above reinforce glass could be seen. When looking, Vorden had memories of the tests he had been put through.

At the time, they were unaware that Raten and Vorden were in Sil’s mind and were trying to force Sil to use his six abilities again. So he fought against a dangerous beast in this chamber, hoping to draw out his power.

Vorden could see a younger version of himself in Sil’s body fighting for his life.

"Sil, although you had the power to wield six abilities, your body never did quite go through the change that Hilston wanted for you, unlike the rest of us. We were able to achieve superhuman bodies, but you weren’t. We all saw Hilston losing to that five spike. I’m not telling you to continue that training again now. Still, if you are going to go up against the Dalki again, maybe it would be a good idea to practice in this room from time to time." Vicky suggested.

Hearing this, Sil thought they were right. Sil knew that if he was to fight Hilston head on, or Slicer that he wouldn’t have survived, which was why he had taken advantage of the situation in the first place.

However, thinking about training in this place again made him think of the temple and every bad thought that came with it.

"We can do that somewhere else," Vorden said. "It doesn’t need to be in this place. We are just here to find out more about Hilston and get some crystals."

Turning around, Vicky headed to the centre of the training room.

"You know, you can’t keep protecting him like that. It’s because of you two in the first place protecting him that he hasn’t been able to grow.

Pai had pressed some buttons on the monitoring machinery by the side of the room, and a steam-like substance started to appear out from the centre of the room. Then a circular platform could be seen.

The group walked on the platform, and soon it started to sink into the ground like an elevator. The first things they could hear were the cries and shouts of beasts.

"Where is this place taking us?" Vorden asked. Worried that they were heading into a trap, but what reason could Pai and Vicky have for doing that now?

"Don’t worry. It’s a separate storage place that Hilston used and was where the strong beast you used to fight with when you were younger were kept. Honestly, without being fed, I’m not sure how they were able to stay alive this long."

When the evaluator finally stopped, the door opened, and two people could be seen standing in front of them. Immediately all of them were ready for a fight.

"Mother! Father!" Vicky shouted.
