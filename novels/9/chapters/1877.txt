Chapter 1878 The World has Changed

Sil had been to Green City a few times before, so as long as their location hadn't changed, he was able to get them all back safe and sound to Green City. If it had changed, then there was a good chance that they would be falling in the sea, but rather than ask, Sil had decided to just grab them and teleport them all anyway.

Slowly, after using his powers, he began to open his eyes, and could see they were in the lab that he was familiar with. At the top of Green tower.

"Great, it looks like we made it safe, that's a relief." Sil said with a smile.

"Relief, what do you mean by that? Were you not sure?" Quinn asked, somewhat guessing what could've happened to them all if Sil hadn't used his powers correctly.

"We are here right, so all is okay, come on. We have a lot to catch up on." Sil stated.

In the lab there was a lot of open space but there weren't many seats, since in the first place it was a lab made for Logan to work on his experiments and such. Placing both his hands on the floor and activating his soul weapon, he could control and make anything into a form of technology or AI, so he started to break down the structure of the place and turn it into large seats for everyone to sit down in.

Once everyone was seated, Logan sat back in his chair, and let out a big sigh.

"I have to say, none of what has occurred was within my calculations." Logan said looking at Chris who was even in the room with them. "I guess, so that we are all up to date, we should start off with informing Quinn what has occurred from the beginning since he had left, and then maybe we can figure this whole thing out."

The others agreed, and Quinn was also interested to know what they had been doing. It was easier for Logan to do the talking and explaining, because he had filmed a lot of the events after Quinn had left.

The first thing that had taken place, of course, was the tournament that had occurred. During that, Vincent had revealed himself stating that he was looking for Quinn. However, the tournament had been stopped as Laxmus had joined in at the last second, eventually taking out Vincent and taking the Red heart which Vincent had instilled in his body.

"Wait, Vincent is still alive, and he had the red heart!" Quinn said, surprised. Another person, who had helped him through a lot was here.

"Vincent is still alive, we are using a Nest crystal to get his vitals back up to what they were before. Don't worry, I will let you see him." Logan said.

Continuing on the tale, Logan went on to inform them of the next part, and that was heading to the Red Vampires' base. While there, they were already fighting with the dhampirs. Laxmus had been defeated, but the Red Heart had been taken by Erin.

From listening to everything, and the details the other went into when describing how strong she was, Quinn was trying to think how he would deal with her. Laxmus certainly was powerful and had the help of his celestial, by quite a bit by the sounds of it.Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

He was also happy to hear that Borden was alive as well, and when they had no problems, he would like to go back to the Blade family, possibly with Sil, to say hello to them.

In the end, Quinn had decided that he was currently stronger then Erin. He just couldn't imagine the current him not being able to deal with her. However, his mind was quite distracted by one thing.

'Layla... so she really was working on our side this whole time, and she is still alive and in charge of the Red Vampires. That is a relief. I would love to go see her... but what would I even say?' Quinn thought.

Then it was time for them to explain why they had gone to the Pure base, Rein, in the first place. Trying to find out why Erin had turned into what she was currently. They explained their theory of thinking it was linked with Leo, and that was why they had gone to Chris.

That's when they were in for a surprise, and learnt about Leo's dreadful past. While listening to it all, Quinn was clenching his fist. While telling him the story, the others felt a pressure coming off him, that made them feel heavy, that even he wasn't aware he was giving.

Quinn sat there in silence for a good five minutes with no one saying a word due to how heavy the atmosphere was. Until...

"Daddy, please don't be angry!" Minny shouted as she ran over and jumped up sitting in his lap. "I don't like it when dad is upset. We just got back, and we are together now, and now you're all upset!"

For some reason, seeing Minny act this way, it had calmed him down a bit, and he gave her a big smile and hug.

"You also went through a lot as well. I'm sorry that you got hurt and your powers taken away... don't worry. I promise I will pay her back." Quinn stated.

Minny didn't see it because Quinn had said these words while hugging her, but the others could see for a second, a flash of red glow was seen in his eyes. He was beyond furious whenever a certain person's name was mentioned, he was just hiding it extremely well.

Now with Minny sitting in his lap, he was stroking her which she seemed to enjoy and he continued while talking since it was calming for the both of them.

"From everything that has been explained so far, from the sounds of it, if I was to take a guess, Zero is also working for a god." Quinn explained.

There were many confused faces and looks in the room, but Quinn went on with his theory for a while.

"I can't think of anyone else that would be able to bring back those that he killed back on this earth. Perhaps a god has promised him that he will bring them back if he does something for them. This is the only thing that makes sense in my head.

"I know a lot of you won't understand what I'm talking about, but maybe it's time I tell you everything I have been through."

Quinn went on to detail what had occurred to him while he was away, and to all of them it sounded like a mystical tale. Planets, other races, gods, a celestial space, and more. It was hard for them to imagine there were such things, that their current lives and the things they were going through were so small in the grand scale of the universe.

What was even more impressive were the strange actions that Quinn had decided to take to come back. Even when telling his story, they could tell how urgent and serious he sounded in wanting to come back.

However, despite all the things about the gods, and such of the world, the one thing that stuck out to them the most out of everything, was that there was a Dalki. This was something that they could comprehend and could imagine the dangers that they would face.

Since it was so far away, and in the distance, Quinn had told them not to worry about it, at least for now. Instead he wanted to focus on the current problems that Earth had before any of that.

"Erin... honestly, I'm not sure what to do. From the story you told I think she too is dangerous. I understand you guys trying to find out the truth, and finding out why she is doing this, but I already lost someone close to me because of that. Leo lost his life because he was too obsessed with finding out why this had happened to her.

"If I was to meet her again, I would say the best thing to do is to put an end to her. Before she does anything else."

The answer from Quinn had surprised many in the room. Although they had only been traveling Quinn for a short while, they knew no matter what he would avoid killing unless he had to, and now he was willing to kill his friend just like that.

It made them think, what Quinn had expressed, learning about the Celestials and that entire space to act like this, caused him to see the world in a different way.

"What about Layla." Peter asked. "I know you might be able to accept the fact that we have to eliminate Erin, but Layla won't, and are you going to be the one that tells her you killed her best friend without finding out why?"

Peter was right, and the silence from Quinn made him think. He was still sure it was the right thing to do, but his emotional attachment to Layla made him second guess things for sure.

"I know!" Sil clicked his fingers. "Hey Logan, what location is the Red Vampire base at again."

Saying a bunch of numbers that only Sil would understand, Sil nodded, and opened up a portal, disappearing. Then a minute later it had opened up again and being pushed out the portal along with Sil was none other than Layla.

"Why don't you talk to her yourself."
