The clones created from the god slayer tier boots were certainly special. As stated before, each of them had their own consciousness. They thought and worked in the same way and exactly as Quinn would. So when he gave them certain tasks or orders, he could trust them, because in turn they were himself, and he knew himself well, at least he thought he did. 

However, only limited information could be passed from the clones, and only when the clones had disappeared would all of their memories, their visions, and all of what they had experienced be transferred to the real Quinn. 

When fighting with the clones, Quinn didn't pay much attention to this, because he would only be using them for a limited time. It was the first time he had extended out his clones and had really used them in such a way.

Currently the real Quinn was in the camp, still with the demon general Lexor in front of him. The air around them had changed, it was vibrating. The others could feel that something was up, but were unable to sense what was actually going on like Quinn could. 

He could see that the energy in the air was moving in a certain direction being drawn, and just moments ago, the clone he had created had been defeated. In doing so, all of the information had directly entered the real Quinn. 

'You did a good job holding on.' Quinn thought. 'I guess it's now my turn to finish off what you started.'

Turning around, Quinn had quickly thrown both of his hands out, no aura came out from his hands, nothing could be seen physically coming out, yet all three of the Skullys that had come with him felt as if they were being pushed by an invisible force. 

It was incredibly strong, lifting them off their feet and sending them back far and to the edge of where the forest was. The Skullys that had been hiding in the forest and watching so far, leapt up in pairs grabbing hold of the others catching them before they were seriously hurt. 

"What the! Why would Quinn just suddenly attack us like that out of the blue." Tuni held onto his chest. He and the others were now standing on a thick branch. They were noticing that many of the other Skullys were there with them, standing on the outside looking in at the camp. 

"I don't think it's that." Anon said, as he stood up and bowed his head slightly thanking the other Skullys. "You saw how easily he killed those other demons, do you really think that if he wanted to kill us, he would have done something like this, most likely he just wanted us to get out of his way.' 

What Quinn had done was actually extremely skillful. He was using the third stage of Qi, but had to use the energy in such a way where it would stop after touching the outside of their body. That way it felt more like a strong push. Because if he used it how he usually would have, the Qi would have struck them, killing them on the spot. 

It was an action that Quinn himself had done on autopilot, perhaps living his whole life trying to protect those around him, he just couldn't help himself, even though he had tried his best to set up a barrier in his head. 

If he wanted to get rid of Immortui, then that needed to be the only task in his head, especially if he didn't want those close to him to be hurt. The energy around him was moving violently now, and pushing off the ground, Quinn quickly moved out of the area to the edge of the base camp and at the same time, from above something had come crashing down into the ground like a giant meteorite. 

The stone from the floor flew up and cracks were seen coming out all the way to the edge, even reaching where Quinn was standing.

"What is all this?" A deep grinding voice said. "How… how could so many of us have been killed." 

As the dust started to settle, Quinn could see who it was, but he already knew who it was, since he had seen him before, but what had come as a surprise was the fact that he wasn't alone and there was something else behind him, stuck onto his back. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Retracting its long sharp red spikes, they had been removed from the champion's body, and in doing so, he fell to the floor, blood oozing from the multiple wounds that were all over his body. 

The Skullys that were in the forest immediately recognised him, it was the champion, the one who ruled the plane before the demons had arrived, the great Skully Calva.

"That's the champion, the champion is here!" One of the Skullys said, excited. 

"He's tied up, and injured, he doesn't look like he can do much, which means the other one with him, must be the demon king."

"Two terrors are here together, all to deal with the intruder. I wonder what will happen, if the intruder will be okay." 

The one the Skullys were referring to as the intruder was Quinn. It was strange to see these strong powers in an area like this and the feelings of the Skullys were mixed. Because in their mind, Calva, although had the name champion, was one that terrorised them before the demons had arrived. 

Although in the past there wasn't anything as cruel as the hunting games in the past, Calva did as he wished. At times, if he had a bad temper, he would destroy an entire village, wiping out many of the Skullys. In their heads, the best result might be if everyone was just to get rid of each other. I think you should take a look at

"But that won't break the cycle." Anon mumbled to himself, thinking the same thing. "If the demon king dies, then another demon king will just replace him. If Calva disappeared, then one of the skullys would take his place. It is our desire to prove that we are strong and fight against each other." 

Even Anon felt it himself at times, it was hard for him to control, but they all had short tempers. The thing was, it almost felt unnatural,these feelings, but since it had been this way for them since his own existence, it was played as the nature of all beings in the universe to be like this. 

Despite being heavily injured and chained up, Calva was quite awake, his face didn't show great signs of pain, and using his knees and feet, he stood up from the ground, blood dripping from all over his body. The current image of him with the blood all over his own body, made him look more frightening compared to before. 

"Don't worry, I won't try and escape." Calva said. "These restraints greatly weaken my power. I'm not a fool to fight a losing battle." 

"So you admit that I am stronger than you?" Kronker, the demon king said.

Calva didn't say anything, because he was weaker than him, at least with the chains still on his body. Now that he was standing up, he started to look at the scene around them as well. The pile of dead bodies, how many Skullys had been killed, how long had they been doing this for?

This was something that the demons had done, to try and convince him to fight for them, but he didn't care. At least he thought he didn't. The sight of the pile of dead bodies was something that was hard for even him to stomach.

His eyes soon lingered though, on the dead demons that were spread out on the ground, with several sword-like marks on their bodies. 

'This wasn't done by a Skully, who could it have been, was it that man from before? He was capable of doing this, but he is dead now.' 

Lifting his head up though, on the other side, the person he was thinking of was right there in front of him. Calva blinked hard a few times wondering if the image would disappear, if his mind had generated an image but it wasn't the case. 

"You… Did you escape to here?" Kronker chuckled, thinking he was in luck. He happened to come to where the person had escaped to, which means he could finish him off. 

"Escape?" Quinn said, as he started to gather blood aura in his fist. 

The red aura surrounded his entire body, it was being pushed out, and all of it was swirling to his hands. Immediately all of those in the forest could feel the power, and the look on Kronker's face had completely changed, his crystal hard eyebrows pointed inward. 

'What is this mass amount of power… it's covering the entire planet.'

"Let's see if you can take a punch from the real me." Quinn said, as the aura condensed down.
