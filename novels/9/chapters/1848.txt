Chapter 1849: Leo and Sera. (Part 2)

After taking down the first two major bases, Sera and Leo continued from there onward. Both of them were surprised that the other had succeeded and actually believed that perhaps the other would fail. As a contingency, the plan in their head was to move to the base where the other had just lost, or to help them out.

Yet, they had both been successful and had managed to finish the task quite quickly. Because of this, they decided to continue attacking other major locations. Since the third one was on the flight path of both of them, they had decided to attack it together, which had only sped up their pursuit.

The Shelters were expecting their defences to last weeks and for attacks to have weeks in between. But in truth, they were falling in a matter of days with little rest on both sides.

After that, the group managed to take back all five of the major cities containing resources that could be used against them. Some of the cities started to fight back once they had learnt what was happening.

Key people were able to inform that their families and more had been held, hostage originally. At the same time, a few vampires or those from Sera's group, were left behind in the shelters they had taken over.

A small little token army to update them on everything that was happening, and just in case Pure decided to attack back. But in truth, everything was just moving too fast for Pure. The situation had turned on its head. Those that were their allies and support, had now become their enemy.

Finally, Pure had no choice but to back away. They had exited from the other shelters they had occupied, pulling out. It was a smart move on their end because there was still a major issue, which was the main Pure base.

Although, none of the Shelters were under the Pure banner anymore. With a sizable and strong force still out there somewhere, including the leader, it meant that they would be able to come back at any time, causing trouble again.

So, now together, both Sera and Leo travelled, trying to find members of Pure and track down the main base. Currently, the two were at a sand kingdom. A shelter that was covered in sand but had main base. Currently, the two were at a sand kingdom, places almost everything built from sandstone and golden jewels.

The kingdom was a wealthy one. There were rumours that they were working with Pure, helping them export certain goods, in return for crystals. The desert was bare and they had no well known travellers that could travel to other planets and get high-level crystals for them. Yet, the sand kingdom was known as a place with plenty of crystals. It didn't quite add up.

Currently, both Sera and Leo were confronting what was known as the Prince of the Shelter.

"I promise I know nothing, we have never done dealings with Pure!" The large man who was begging on his knees and had his fat belly showing said.

They were in the royal palace which was quite extravagant and there was even a throne towards the back.

All of this was just an act of the Shelter, since royalty had long stopped existing in today's society. VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

Sera then threw another frail man down onto the ground, he looked back and his eyes met with Leo's.

"Tell us everything about your kingdom and their dealings with Pure." Leo asked. It was his influence skill, and a human like so, it had worked out quite well on.

"The Rashin kingdom has a few deals set up. We purchase Glathrium using the crystals they supply us. We then take a small cut from those crystals and pass the Glathrium onto Pure." The man spoke.

The sweat could be seen running down the large man's face as he heard this. But that wasn't the end.

"We also, every month, send a ship full of slaves to them."

Hearing this, Leo's hand gripped tight around his sword.

"First, you lie to us. I can understand you might want to improve your kingdom so you have done deals with Pure. However, what I can't understand is why you would have slaves."

"Please!" The man begged.

"You don't understand, I didn't have the choice. When they came here, they realized that we already had our own slaves, but they said that if we gave the slaves to them, that they could live a better life."

"They paid a good price for them, and I can help you as well. That's what you want, right, crystals, money, I can cut you in on the deal as..." Before he could finish his sentence, Sera had thrown a small dagger that went right between his eyebrows and into his head, killing him on the spot.

"I could have gathered more information from him or we could have used him?" Leo replied.

"Really? I thought with your powers, you would have just told me that the Pure member is hiding right behind that throne." Sera replied as he took another dagger out and threw it right at the throne.

Instead of going through it, it spun and went around the throne and a loud scream was heard from behind.

Leo had seen the man with his ability, but thought there was a better way to find out what was going on, although Sera was right. It was unlikely that they knew the truth behind the slaves.

"Are they experimenting again to make those humanoid beasts, or is it something else?" Leo thought.

Quickly running behind, they could see that a man had been hurt, the blade had gone right through his leg. He took out a dagger and attempted to attack Leo, but in that moment, Leo pushed his sword down and the tip hit the side of the dagger pinning it to the floor.

"We need to try something else." Leo said.

"What do you mean? Can't you just use your red eye magical power?" Sera asked as he kicked the Pure member in the face causing his head to be flung back and hit the back of the throne. He was knocked out immediately and fell back to the floor.

"We have found Pure members time and time again, yet we still haven't found their base. The threat of Pure is not over until we find Zero."

"We can't keep doing the same thing hoping that one of these people have the information, which is why I would suggest something else."

When telling Sera his plan, his eyes lit up and he had quite a smirk on his face.

"Do you think they would accept?" Sera replied. "And besides, could you really do that to a person?"

"This man is the one that has been transporting the slaves. I have been tailing him in the Shelter for a while. His life is not one worth having. In the end, if he was going to die anyway, then he should at least have a use." Leo answered.

Sera had been with Leo for a while now, fighting side by side. As time went on, it was as if Leo was getting a little darker in his methods. For Sera, he didn't mind, but it did make him wonder why he was so concerned about finding this person.

It was then that Leo cut his hand and allowed for blood to fall. It dropped into the Pure agent's mouth. At the same time, he drew a circle underneath his body, one that he had been taught. The blood ritual was activated.

The Pure agent's eyes opened, and his eyes started to beam with a red glow. The next second, he had sprung awake. The Pure agent had become a vampire.

"Now, I'm sure you know a way to get back to your base. And I would like you to deliver a message to your leaders."

"Now that you're a vampire, I don't believe that they would treat you the same way as before, and I'm afraid you have no choice." Leo's eyes glowed red as he made the order.

A week later, the Pure agent had returned to the submarine, the main base of Pure, with a note in his hand, but he was shaking. They had let him in after reading the contents of the message to them.

They knew it was important as he shook when he walked through everywhere until, he had finally met Zero. He opened up the letter and began to read it out loud.

"The men known as Leo and Sera, challenge both Zero and Chris to a duel at these coordinates. If you wish to accept, they will be there in two days' time at noon." The man had given his message and closed the letter.

Standing up, Zero walked over to him, placing his hand on his cheek.

"I can't believe he did this to you, don't worry. I'll help you."

Pulling out his blade, Zero took a slash swiping his head clean off.

"So you're that confident, huh, well, I accept."
