Chapter 956 - Getting rid of sc.u.m (Part 2)

Before Oscar could introduce everyone, it seemed like he had been called to handle something and had to leave the banquet hall in a rush.

"I hope everyone gets along. Introduce yourself to each other. You will all be working together quite closely from now on." Oscar said as he left everyone.

It seemed like the Graylash family and the military generals had been talking for some time before Quinn had arrived, so their attention was focused on them.

"So, Oscar said your name was Hardy, correct?" One of the male head generals asked. His hair was a reddish-brown in colour and was quite long for someone in the military, going down to his collarbone. However, every once in a while, he would have this slight twitch that Quinn noticed, moving his upper lip.

"I don’t know much about the Cursed faction. However, I do know of Helen and of the Zombie boy over there, but you I have never heard of your name before?" The man said.

"I would have thought the Cursed faction had some old faction leaders they could have sent here. What are your accomplishments exactly?" The red-haired man asked.

Now that Quinn was closer, he recognised the three Head Generals a little more. Their appearance looked a little different to what he remembered, but that was due to him seeing them on TV when he was younger.

These three generals were also claimed to be part of the hero’s of war. Having great accomplishments in the war against the Dalki. However, they weren’t as famous as Leo or Oscar.

’Is that why they seem to be a little arrogant?’ Vincent said. ’I think they are asking of your accomplishments only so they could boast about their own.’

Quinn agreed.

"I think this little trial Oscar is doing might prove to be a failure." Another general from the military spoke. His hair was green in colour, and when looking closely, one could see that their tongue was split into two halves like a snake. "They have allowed the Graylash family and the Cursed faction to make three Head Generals. They trusted the other powerhouses, and they have chosen to assign a nobody, or maybe this is just the next best person the faction have got?"

Peter’s fist was clenching up by the second. He didn’t care who they were. Right now, someone was disrespecting their leader, thier group, everything they had worked hard for, and after everything, they had gone through.

"It seems like you have got his tongue-tied. The man can’t say anything because he hasn’t even achieved any accomplishments. Everyone knows that the Cursed faction bullied all the other factions by using those beasts. That’s how you rose to your position, and it doesn’t sit well with us. I’m sure even Helen here dispises working for you. Perhaps we could come to some sort of deal with you barbarians, so we can bring her over to our side." The red-haired man said, but he wasn’t done thier. He could tell that thier were some onlookers around nodding in agreement with what he was saying, which just spurred him on further.

"Oscar, only has let you guys in, in the hopes to tame you, so that you don’t attack the people. This is a time when we should be working together to fight against the Dalki. And your faction members continued to attack each other all for your own gains!" The man continued to shout. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

"I am not being held against my will, and I would much rather work with the Cursed faction than a broken military that can’t even trust the decisions of its supreme commander." Helen piped up. "The Cursed faction is stronger than you think. I’m sure you know of the strength of my group and my faction, and even then, the Cursed faction was able to beat us. I assure you, anyone they have assigned to the position of Head General, would be able to make each of you lie on your back. Perhaps they may even fix your broken tongue while they’re at it."

"What did you say?! I dare you to try to prove those words right now!" The split tongued man shouted, and it looked like he was about to use an ability of some sort as he raised his hand, but before he could even do so, it had already been stopped being held in place.

"Arghh!" The man screamed, and a few cracking sounds were heard from his fingers as they were being crushed by the sheer pressure.

"What do you think you’re doing? Did you just try to attack someone from our family!" Peter shouted at the man.

The scream and Peter’s words were so loud, that the others in the banquet hall were now looking in their direction.

Usually, Quinn would tell Peter to stop, but from what he had learnt in the past it was best to put these people in their place when he could.

The third general was a female with a long black ponytail that nearly touched the floor. She noticed something at this point. She could see Quinn’s eyes starting to glow red and took a step back from the other two, she was debating whether to warn them or not, but a shiver was entirely sent down her spine.

"You want to know what type of power the Cursed faction have," Quinn said, looking at the two of them with his eyes glowing red. At this point, Peter had let go of the man’s crushed hand and smiled in anticipation for what was about to come next.

"Both of you, kneel!" Quinn ordered, and a few seconds later, as if their body was being forced, they dropped to the ground and were on their knees.

From the outside, the onlookers had no clue what was happening and only saw that two of the Head Generals were kneeling in front of another, but it was one that they didn’t recognise.

"What is going on? Do they know that person?" Fay asked, looking from the side. "None of us recognised him."

"No, look at the struggle on their faces." Nathan pointed out, "It must be some ability of some sort. They’re being forced."

"Should we go do something, isn’t that our Head General?" Hayley asked.

However, Nathan was interested in the person he would be taking orders from, from now on and decided to let things play out.

"You talk about working together, and then you attempt to attack us before finding out more about us. You know nothing about the Cursed faction, and all of you tried to drag our name through the mud.

"Let me tell you, the reason we are here is to get rid of the sc.u.m in the military, and I haven’t quite made up my mind yet if you two fit that role." Quinn continued to speak, but it wasn’t in a soft voice. Everyone around could hear as well.

"The Cursed faction are here to get rid of sc.u.m. What do they mean?" People started to gossip around.

The two on the ground could be seen trying to struggle, trying to fight whatever was happening in their bodies, but they could do nothing as they were forced to stay on the ground.

"You, you are attacking us in front of everyone!" The red haired man continued to shout.

"Don’t speak," Quinn ordered again, and now the two of them couldn’t even open their mouths.

’This boy seems to have a darkside.’ Helen thought, looking at him, and l.i.c.k.i.n.g her lips slightly.

Quinn had simply had enough of this behaviour through his life, and it was the same in the vampire settlement. The thing was now, there was no reason he had to take it. No one they had to complain to.

"I apologise on Head General Innu, and Head General Sach’s behalf." The female general said, getting down on one knee. "You are right, I believe they were quite hostile towards your faction from the start. Please I hope you can forgive them and let them go. I hope that all the Head Generals can get along."

Hearing her say these words, calmed Quinn down a little. He turned around and decided to leave the room, while Helen and Peter soon followed.

Everyone quickly moved away from them, allowing them to pass for fear that they would be attacked as well.

"This might just make our reputation even worse, you know?" Helen said as they left the room. ’What was that ability of his that he used just now, it wasn’t part of the shadow?’

"It’s okay, people will find out the truth in the end, but I can’t forgive anyone that tries to attack my family right in front of me," Quinn said.

The Cursed faction had made quite the impression on their very first day.
