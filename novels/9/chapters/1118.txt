Chapter 1119 - A family reunion

As soon as Quinn laid his hands on the tablet, it began to shine in a bright blue colour, lighting up the place around them. The others were in shock about all the things happening. First the dragon, a beast that was known for its violent nature to kill anything in sight, had not attacked Quinn and now this.

The reason why they were so surprised was because even when Eno had touched the tablet to grant Shiro his abilities, nothing of the sort had occurred. Logan and the others had reunited with the other group in the jungle. They had a good view of things since the dragon wasn’t blocking their vision. ​​

Logan looked at Eno for a possible explanation, but the look on the old man’s face was genuine. For once, he was as clueless as everyone else.

Quinn continued to leave his hands on the tablet, as an energy he felt was connecting with him from the inside.

’This feeling... It was so disturbing at first, but now it helps me keep calm. But why does it feel so familiar? Is this how everyone feels when they touch the tablet?’ Quinn wondered since he hadn’t been there to witness Eno before. ’I guess nothing will happen though since I already have an ability.’

"This young one already has power, and he is unlike the man from before, so there is nothing he can gain from me here." Quinn heard a voice that he was unable to recognise.

Turning his head around, Quinn was looking for where the voice had come from, but everyone was just looking at him, none of them had uttered so much as a single word. The voice echoed a bit, similar to when Jill would send him messages via the telepathy ability, so he tried to direct his thoughts at the tablet. ’Who are you?’

"You... you can hear me?" The voice asked in shock.

’Damn it, it’s like speaking to Vincent all over again!’ Quinn thought in mild annoyance. All those around him continued to watch him. It was clear to him that he was the only one able to perceive this voice.

"I don’t know who this Vincent is, but you’re the first one I’m able to converse with." The voice replied, now curious why that was the case.

It seemed like just like with Vincent, that the voice had access to his thoughts while he was touching the tablet. Since Quinn had only been able to hear the voice after touching the tablet, he could only assume it was either the tablet itself or someone or something left inside it.

’Are you the tablet?’ Quinn asked as it was the fastest way to find out, instead of racking his brain.

"Do you really think tablets can speak or were you just born like this?" The voice asked in derision. Listening to it for a bit it sounded as if it might belong to a middle aged man, not too old nor too young.

"No, the tablet is merely a tool. I don’t know how much you know, but all the abilities that humans currently possess originally came from me. At one point I decided that my time was up, and my final gift to the world was this. My mortal body should have long since perished, but I never expected to still be somewhat conscious when I gave up everything to be placed inside of here."

It was pretty hard for a person to believe, but Quinn had read the diaries of Arthur and heard Eno’s explanation. All the abilities supposedly had come from this tablet, and now Quinn was hearing the voice inside confirm pretty much that to be the truth.

’Are you some type of god? How did you leave the world with so many abilities? Did you really come up with every ability, even the shadow ability I possess?’ Quinn wondered.

For the first time the tablet seemed to pause before answering.

"Shadow ability? I’m afraid I did not possess such an ability, but someone I knew back in the past did. You must have received it from him somehow. As to your question, no I am not a god, although I managed to become far stronger than any of the gods during my time." The man started to laugh.

This made him seem to be quite the arrogant person in Quinn’s eyes. While it was interesting to talk with him, he really didn’t know how much this person could help him. Perhaps it was time to think of a way to deal with the dragon. It might have stopped its attack because of the tablet, but there was no guarantee it wouldn’t revert to a wild beast, once they were further away from it.

"Wait!" The tablet spoke out. "While I have your attention I must tell you something very important! Leave that dragon be. That dragon, it came here on its own. Weak at first, but its energy slowly recovered. It must have been attracted to the energy of the tablet without realising it. However, now that he has mostly recovered, I’ve been able to communicate with it somewhat. Maybe because we are similar..."

"For now, the dragon has agreed to protect the stone tablet. You see if the tablet gets destroyed then that also means that all abilities will be lost. The way the system has been set up, the tablet will grant people a suitable ability. When the last person with that ability dies, then it gets sent back to the tablet. Then it will be passed on to a new person who is suitable for that power."

"However, if the tablet gets destroyed, then there is no place for the ability to come back to, do you understand? Earth has gone on a long time without trouble and in doing so it has forgotten its roots, its powers, so this is the only way."

He understood, but Quinn now had a new problem. They had come here to move the dragon beast so the Dalki would be unable to find him, but at the same time, it seemed like the tablet was of utmost importance to humanity. While the dragon was one thing, the tablet would be near impossible to move. The better option would be to protect this island at all costs.

"Honestly, you wouldn’t be able to defeat the dragon even if you tried." The voice in the tablet said. "I assume you being here means you know a bit about this island, but not even the man who was here before had a way to control him. I don’t have complete control over the dragon either, but at least it listens to me somewhat. Although it’s hard to say how much he listens to me and how much he just instinctively chooses to hunt down intruders on the island."

"I know you are young so you might think you are strong and invincible, but believe me you are not strong enough to deal with it. If you try and force the dragon to move elsewhere then I will be unable to help you. You can be sure that it will fight you with its full force!"

’The dragon hasn’t been taking us seriously yet?!’ Quinn was shocked. ’If that’s the case then it’s no wonder how the Dalki could be made from the dragon.’

What was even more amazing was that the vampires had somewhat managed to defeat it. It made him wonder what type of forces had been sent out by vampires to deal with the beast.

’I was wondering, since you seem to have been this all powerful special being and all, can you help us? I mean, you gave everyone the excuse that you wanted to save them. Right now, we’re in serious trouble and it might end up with the extinction of the human race, so is there perhaps anything you can do to help me?’

For the second time the tablet paused again.

"I’m afraid there is not. You already have an ability so I cannot give you another. I was born strong so there is nothing for me to teach you in terms of skills, magic or the sort. The only thing I can give you is information, but I fear my information stems from so far back that it would hardly help you. What I can do is convince my scaly friend to let you pass unharmed though."

It was a bit upsetting in a way. Usually with such a big event, a big discovery Quinn had expected something more. An opportunity to obtain some rare powers, but if there was nothing that could be done, then he would just be happy with the ’get away from the angry dragon’ card.

’Why did you choose to speak to me?’ Quinn asked, before letting go of the tablet.

"I didn’t choose to speak to you. There was a reaction when you touched the tablet. It has never happened before. As I said, you are the first person to be able to hear my voice. As to why you? Your guess is as good as mine."

Quinn didn’t know what really came over him at that moment or what answer he had been expecting, but he had thought that maybe there would be something to it. Perhaps he had read too many fantasy books about a Chosen One, or a prophecy that needed to be fulfilled to vanquish the evil of the world, but it was nothing like that.

"Before you go, I would like to ask you for one last thing. Since you’re the first person who I have been able to speak to, it would seem rude to not even learn your name." The tablet requested. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

’My name’s Quinn...Quinn Talen.’

"That name....it’s a very good name." The tablet replied. Quinn had the feeling it had more to say, but it had apparently chosen to keep those secrets to himself. Alas, there was nothing he could do to pry it open.

Letting go of the tablet, the bright light dimmed down until it eventually disappeared. Quinn turned to the others and now he had one more thing to do. Somehow, he needed to convince Eno that moving the dragon wasn’t the best choice.
