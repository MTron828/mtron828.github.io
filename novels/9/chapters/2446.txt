Colorful Balloons Take Flight

It was hard work, but Xox was able to infiltrate the event as one of the head vampires of the Graylash planet's community, a vampire named Sin. Tears were nearly forming in his eyes, because of how proud he was to have gotten to this moment. 

'It took a lot to get here, but I'm finally here, and now I just need my hard work to pay off, otherwise.' 

From the bottom of his spine to the top of his neck, his whole body shivered. Xox knew about the Grand Meet Up, and of course he could have come as a visitor by just disguising himself as a vampire, but that would have done nothing to help him. His real goal was finding out what happened to Quinn.

While in the middle of trying to figure out a way to arrive at the meet up, once again Xox was summoned by the Ancient One. He was put in a tough situation as they asked him if he had made any progress with the Quinn situation. 

"I have been able to do some research." Xox said. "But as you told me this is a mission where I must not get caught, it has been a little difficult. So far, it seems that Quinn is difficult to find, as if he is up to something like you suspect. I didn't want to report back to you until I knew where he was." 

Xox was hoping that would be enough to delay the Ancient One for a little while, or if it would just cause him to be filled with more anger. 

"I see, if you are having trouble, tell me if there is anything you need me to provide you with." The Ancient One replied. 

Before he was sent off, Xox thought this was actually an opportunity. 

"Sorry sir!" Xox quickly called out. "About that, Quinn and the vampires are relatively strong individuals. I promise that I will keep my identity and reason for being there a secret, but you see, if you want to find out the truth sooner, then there will be times where I need to use force, but I am not a strong being." 

What Xox was saying wasn't really true to his words. What he actually wanted was the Ancient One to provide him some protection, just in case he got caught like the last time, but how was he meant to say he was scared, or inform the Ancient One of what happened, how he was nearly caught. 

Since he was going there a second time, if he got caught again, Xox could only imagine what Layla would do to him, which was why he saw this as an opportunity to ask for something.

Waving his hand, a round item that didn't look special at all was given. It was white in colour, as big as a pebble, but perfectly round. 

"Keep that on you at all times. I can't help you out directly, but as you said there is a chance something might happen. That will protect you, so you at least will survive long enough to give me information." 

It was almost as if the Ancient One was saying, if he didn't get the information he wanted, he didn't care what happened to Xox. With a gulp, Xox bowed down. 

"Thank you for the help." 

With that he had disappeared, and had more drive than before to complete the task.

'Ah crap, I forgot to tell him about Quinn's son and the strange celestial energy. Oh well, I guess I can always tell him that later. I doubt he would care so much about an incomplete celestial.' Xox thought. 

After that, he had travelled to the Graylash family, he had done extensive research and eventually captured the vampire he needed to question. He managed to subdue the vampire with a massive amount of celestial energy knocking him out. 

Then promising him that he would live, he asked him a number of questions so people wouldn't be followed if the two were to swap places. Lastly, the promise was broken as Xox had to get rid of him. 

'Usually celestials are known for keeping their promises, but with a matter as important to do with the celestial, I have no choice.' Xox thought. 

In the end, it was how he had ended up being Sin and being in the position he was in. The head of their teams had their own special VIP seats that were located on the opposite side of the stadium, away from where Layla was. 

When he saw this, Xox was already cursing at himself, why couldn't things just be easy. Instead he was seated next to Muka, Xander, Andy and Jessica, while they continued to watch the contestants. 

The event started with each group doing a performance for the opening ceremony. They were all equally impressive, each with a different style to show during the event. Then it was time for the events themselves.

The event would start with the lowest grades participating in the selected events. Some events would go on at the same time, and one could choose which they wished to watch. Then the same events would continue with the grades continuing the idea. 

However, there was an exception to this, and that was the final event, where each school was to select a single fighter to represent them. This was regardless of grade, and they would go up against each other in a free for all.

The crowd was enjoying it and cheering their kids and friends on as they saw everyone take part. It was filled with energy, like a true sports event, one as big as the olympics. The number of events continued and due to them going from the bottom to the top, it wasn't long until Minny was taking part. 

"Galen, look…it's your sister, wave and cheer for her!" Layla said, holding his hand and waving it for him, even though he was plenty capable of waving it himself. 

"Go MINNY!" Galen shouted. 

It was so adorable that Laya couldn't help but pinch his chubby cheeks.

The obstacle course had a total of 6 participants, two from each group from the same grade. Several machines would be used that would move about and fire out harmless lasers. It would recognise when it touched a contestant, but if one was hit they weren't out, it just meant they would simply lose some points.  The one who lost the least amount of points would be the winner. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The flying drones fired multiple lasers in all directions at the same time and it looked like a laser show. Minny was moving fast as she jumped and twisted her body. She jumped on a few of the items that were around them that they could use to head from one area to the next. 

The other contestants had already been hit multiple times, but not Minny.

"How fast is that small vampire girl… I think she's even faster than most of the adults. How is that possible?" 

"Isn't she faster than most captains of the Vampire Corps?" 

The vampires knew strength when they saw it, and Minny was certainly out there to impress. The event had ended and Minny hadn't been touched once, becoming the clear winner. 

All of those from her school and parents cheered at the top of their lungs, making it feel as if the arena was shaking. 

"Minny is impressive as always." Jessica said from her seat. 

"Yeah, it's a shame that Quinn isn't here to see this." Andy replied. 

Xox ears suddenly perked up.  Due to where he was seated at the moment, he had no hope in finding anything about Quinn, yet here were two people that were talking about him, and it sounded as if they knew why he was away.
