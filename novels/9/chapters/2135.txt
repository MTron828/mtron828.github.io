Seeing Yonbu didn't bring a smile to Wince's face for a number of reasons. There had always been tales of a god that looked over the planet, and it was only because of the Royal family's treasure in the past that this god didn't get involved in so many affairs.

In the end, the person in front of her, decided to side with the Predators that had gone against her family, and in the process, a lot was lost. The reason Yonbu had supported the predators wasn't so clear, and in the end, she didn't care.

Because of Quinn, the god that looked over the planet hadn't appeared and didn't get involved in the Memerialsl affairs anymore, that was until now, at this point and time.

'Why is he here now of all times? I have to be careful, no matter what, he is a powerful god at the end of

the day.' Wince thought.

The weapon she had with her, a trident, was a replica of her fathers, made in the same shape as the one before, but it didn't contain the same power. It was made with a demon tier beast that wasn't of the same calibre, but it was one that Wince had hunted herself.

Improving her strength, she needed to step up, if such a thing was to happen again. She never counted on Quinn returning and in a situation like this, he wasn't able to help anyway.

Yonbu first looked around the room, and could see the councilmen and woman breaking out in a sweat.

"All of you can relax. I did not come here, to cause any harm." Yonbu stated. "Believe me when I say this, returning to this place gives me a sick feeling in my stomach."

Yonbu's small tentacles that surrounded the bottom of his face started to curl up, and he almost shivered at the thought. The frightening image of the Mermerial god and his actions didn't quite add up.

"I have been given a task by those that are even higher than myself. I can't explain much, but I have said this so all of you know the gravity of the matter." Yonbu explained.

Many were confused, after seeing Quinn they knew that there was the existence of other gods, but had no clue about the hierarchy or the system they had. What they did know, was it wasn't something they wanted to get involved in, not at a time like this.

"Yonbu, just state why you are here and be gone!" Wince shouted as she pulled out her trident and slammed it on the floor. She wasn't going to be intimidated. To her Yonbu was more of an outsider.

"None of you show any respect for me anymore." Yonbu complained. "I will be out of your hair and out of here as soon as I can, as long as you help me. I am looking for BB, or the one that is also known as Quinn Talen."

Almost immediately, as they heard this name, the people in the room started to look at eachother, and Wince's heart started to beat slightly faster. As she thought, the fact that Quinn had come back and this figure in front of her couldn't have been a coincidence.

"Quinn Talen left this planet long ago, he is not from here!" Wince answered.

"Which is why I ask for your help." Yonbu replied. "He helped you out before, for some reason in the past. So I figured you might have a way to communicate with him."

"I do not!" Wince replied immediately.

The thing was, Yonbu wasn't so convinced, and judging by the reaction of the others in the room when he said that name, it felt like something was up.

"And what about my request, to help find him? Did you not hear what I said? This matter is more important than the Memorial race. If you do not help there will be big trouble." Finishing his sentence, water spread out from underneath his legs and went out in a wave, hitting the others sending them back and crashing into the wall.

For Wince, she spun her trident and managed to chuck the wave of water off to the side avoiding getting hit.

"Is this how you act? If we don't comply with your request, you then force us. You who have done nothing for us, why should we help you!" Wince argued.

"You are correct." Yonbu answered. "But the thing is, if you are not willing to help, then I need to start thinking of some other ways to find Quinn Talen, and perhaps hurting someone who he cares about will be a way to bring him here."

Wince was nervous. Yonbu was emitting a lot of power with his eyes alone, his wings had sprouted from his back, dripping water from them. Just looking at him it was hard to be in his presence.

"If you hurt me‚Ä¶then you will be going up against the whole Mermerial race!" Wince shouted.

She didn't want to give up Quinn. Whatever reason they were looking for him, it couldn't be a good one, and if Yonbu was willing to go to these lengths, then if they found out his family were here, they would attack them as well. She needed to protect his family, it was the least she could do.

"Quinn Talen was here, but he's not here anymore!" One of the councilmen shouted.

"Silence!" Wince shouted back at him.

"My Queen, we must be truthful, to protect the people. Quinn is no longer here, he left to go somewhere else." The man continued to explain.

"So you did lie to me," Yonbu said, and instead of going after Wince, he decided to go straight for the councilmen, and lifted him by his neck, holding him in the air. He knew the Queen wouldn't say anything, but it seemed like he found someone that would.

"If you care for your life, you will tell me everything you know about him." Yonbu ordered.

"Quinn Talen was here. He came here with his family and friends, and they left, we don't know where but he will return, that's all we know, I promise!" The councilman said.

Yonbu let go of the man's throat, letting him drop to the ground.

"His family is here, interesting."

"I will not let you go near his family!" Wince shouted, as she went to thrust her trident and water started to swirl around it.

Seeing this, Yonbu's eyes started to glow as he was summoning his celestial power. As he did this, he threw out his hand, and a vortex of water came out, matching the attack from the trident.

"Do you think of me as so easy to deal with, I am still a god!" Yonbu shouted.

There was a clear winner in the two powers, as Wince was being pushed back, instead of thrusting her trident forward she started to spin it. It was hard for her to still hold back the attack, until an energy was being summoned around her as well.

The scales on her face were showing more, the shape of her eyes were narrowing, and a large fin was appearing out from her back.

Swinging the trident, the attack was completely stopped and Wince could be seen standing there with a strange aura surrounding her.ChùíÜ√™ck out lùíÇtùíÜst ùíèùíêvùíÜlùíî on novùíÜl/bin(.)cùíêm

"You‚Ä¶have celestial power as well, how is this possible?" Yonbu thought.

When Quinn was still a celestial, it was the power he had given Wince before he left. In case any situation was to occur and for taking the trident, he wanted to leave her with something, and that something was this.

Outside of the palace, Layla was out shopping with her family, she held Galen on her shoulders, while Minny was in her hand, but suddenly Minny came to a stop.

"What‚Ä¶is that..that power, it feels familiar?" Minny said, looking at the palace.

Layla couldn't quite feel what Minny was feeling, but the large flash of light didn't go unnoticed, and she had an uneasy feeling about it all.

'Should we check It out‚Ä¶or is it best to hide?' Layla thought.

At that moment, the weight on top of her shoulders disappeared, and she could see a little Galen, running towards the Royal palace.

"Galen!" Layla shouted.
