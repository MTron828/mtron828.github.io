Chapter 2534 ¬†The Return of a Legend

The settlement was in a tough place just moments ago, but thanks to the help of the vampires from the Vampire Corps and Chris, along with the others, they had gotten rid of the majority of demons.

The few that were still alive were getting killed off by the Divine beings, since nearly all of the vampires had changed their strategy to survival, allowing the two to take care of each other.

Now with no demons for them to go after, the Divine beings only had the targets that were still alive, and those were the vampires. Unlike the werewolves and Yaks who had raw power, vampires were diverse when it came to their areas of strength, but that didn't work out so well against the Divine beings.

To kill the Dark beings, they needed attacks strong enough to finish them off before the Golden beings could heal them. At the same time, they were too busy trying to avoid attacks from the Divine beings, so they couldn't deal with the gold ones either.

The situation wasn't getting any better, especially with the multiple portals that were opening up above the settlement. Even more Divine beings were coming in, and it was starting to fill up the sky. It looked like there were now more of them than there were vampires.

"RAGH!" Chris grunted. A giant claw mark went through the air and hit a large group of the Divine beings, killing them on the spot. For a moment, the sky above could be seen, but it was quickly filled up with even more of the Divine beings.

"Even if we get rid of the portals, they just keep coming back one after the other? Is there no way to stop them?" Layla asked.

The skin from her fingertips had peeled off, and she was bleeding with each arrow that she fired. Even though she was just using Qi arrows, force was still needed when pulling. She had long gone past her limit but was still pushing herself.

Because if she didn't, then it would mean another death in the settlement.

Chris was trying to think of what he could do. Although immensely and physically strong, and with an unlimited amount of stamina as long as he kept eating people, he couldn't figure a way out of this.

Because his attacks didn't cover enough range, and the moment he would take out a large amount of them, they would quickly come back.

"We're just outnumbered in this situation; the whole settlement is outnumbered," Muka said.

Most of the Divine beings were flying up in the sky, pointing their dark spears and firing down. When continuing to look at the sky, they noticed large beams of energy firing out towards the masses of the Divine beings.

Several lasers of energy hit them one by one. Quickly, the group turned their heads, and through the sky, they could see a fleet of ships coming their way. They were flying fast, firing away energy blasts.

A group of them was diving toward the group, and Peter was getting ready to act, but before he did, a large wave erupted from the ground. It had grown as if it was made from dirt but had a grayish tint to it.

As the spears hit the wave, it started to spark slightly, and lightning emitted out from the large wave. Right after, several spikes started to grow, piercing all of the Divine beings one by one.

"It looks like we managed to make it just in time," a voice said, walking over.

"Jake!" Layla called out, recognizing the young man.

He was the son of Logan Green and Vicky Blade. He was once deemed one of the strongest humans in existence, but that title would have to go to Sil; in reality, it was only due to Sil not being present.

Nonetheless, he was an incredibly strong individual who could mix abilities together and use them at the same time.

"It seemed like you needed some help; my father answered your call, and he brought some help along with him.

There was a large ship behind him, floating toward the planet, and dropping out were small pods. These were similar to the ones the Dalki used for invasions. They shot straight down to the ground in the forest, and opening up, there were humans inside them.

Humans with strong abilities, those from Earth and the Graylash faction, had come out and were willing to fight. They ran through the forest and headed toward the settlement, knowing full well who their enemy was.

"The humans, they're helping us?" Muka said, surprised. Sure, individual humans had helped them on occasion, but not like this.

Fighting side by side in the settlement, it was something that Muka had never dreamed of happening.

"It took a bit of convincing, which is why we were a little late," Jake stated. "But humans haven't forgotten what you did for us. We haven't forgotten what Quinn did for us. So we will be the ones to help you this time."

On an unknown planet, somewhere in the universe, standing on a cliffside was one of the Ancient Ones. Underneath his feet, a stream of water fell to the ground. It was a waterfall that spilled down onto the land below.

For the land Celestalon was standing on was moving. It was floating around the planet, moving like a ship. But it appeared as if there was no form of power moving the island; it just flowed like a cloud.

Continuing to drop water down below, as it continued to go through the clouds.

Celestalon stood there in a large white robe, with his beard touching the floor beneath him. His eyes were glowing white with celestial energy as he had his palms out. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

"Are you still intending to get rid of them all?" Mundus asked.

He was standing around twenty meters away from where Celestalon currently was, facing toward his back.

"I understood when you said you wished to get rid of all the vampires, but the humans have now gotten involved; you have to stop."

"This is a small cost," Celestalon replied. "Are all of the humans in the settlement? No. The humans can reproduce again, and they are not the only life form to care about in the golden space."

"You should know by now, after everything we have gone through, that Immortui is someone who we have to get rid of, no matter what the cost. We will weaken every resolve or chance he has to come over."

"After that, we will defeat him! Even if he is reborn, we shall beat him again and again. When he reincarnates, he won't have the same power as before. We will just continue to squash him, so he may never rise again."

"And if he gets reincarnated with his memories lost, all for the better."

The whole situation left a bad taste in Mundus' mouth. Everything that was happening. Celestalon was doing nothing but causing more trouble in a situation the humans and vampires were trying to solve themselves.

"You underestimate the humans' strength, Celestalon," Mundus said.

At that moment, Celestalon turned around. "What did you say?"

Coming down right from above, something had crashed right in the middle of the two. A shockwave of energy was sent rumbling through their feet, and a powerful one at that. The island had even dropped down in the air for a few moments before it regained and balanced itself.

"What's going on?" Celeston asked. The place he was on, it was a place that only the Ancient Ones and the messenger should have known about. His instant thought was Mundus.

"Mundus, did you betray me, but how, why?" Celestalon asked. "Do you really think there is anyone strong enough to take me on, even if you were to betray me."

The only beings Celestalon could think of were the other Ancient Ones, but they should have no problem with what he was doing.

Unfortunately, Mundus had no clue what was happening right now, and when the dust started to settle, they could see a red-scaled human figure.

"Stop this sh*t attack right now; otherwise, you'll have to deal with me," Ray Talen, the legendary one and king of the Dragons, said.
