Shaking his head, Quinn couldn't let this setback shock him. There were plenty of times when fighting his enemy that his attacks didn't go through. If there was one thing Quinn was, it was the fact that he was versatile with his attacks. If one thing didn't work, then it just meant he would have to try something else.

'Let's keep trying ranged attacks first to see what the Behemoth reacts to, I still can't believe that he didn't react to the last attack at all. 'But now I see, if something like that doesn't hurt it, then why does it need to worry about something like an ant... like me.' It was hard to believe that Quinn was calling himself an ant, but here he was. Running on what width of the platform that the pillar had, he then jumped, aiming to land on another pillar off in the distance.

While doing this, Quinn switched to the blood guns, and once again started to fire away every type of blood bullet he had. They hit the beast, but as somewhat expected, just like the last attack when it touched the skin it did nothing apart from the blood forest bullet.

[The blood is poisonous to the user]

[The blood has not been absorbed]

The blood forest bullet had a special effect where it could pierce through the skin and absorb the blood. This was how Quinn was able to upgrade his own blood powers when fighting against the demons, it also allowed him to heal in fights and if he was fighting against the Dalki it would give him a boost in power. Since this was a god slayer, Quinn thought maybe it would have a special effect but it didn't. Just like beast blood, the blood of this Behemoth was poisonous to him.

'Still, it means one thing, this Behemoth can get hurt. Maybe it just can't react or it's taking away a little health. Just like an ant, maybe over time, it could whittle away a human, a bite at a time?' Quinn continued to fire the bullets as he finally landed on the other pillar away from the Behemoth, while having the image of an ant attacking a human, and he thought he was mad. 'What am I thinking, a human would just heal before a single ant could kill him. The human would die from old age before getting killed by an ant...'

Now having landed on the pillar, Quinn continued his large-scale attacks, first the thousand blood swords that he raised in the sky. He aimed them all towards different parts of the Behemoth. He doubted it would be able to pierce the skin, but perhaps a weak spot could be found. When the swords hit though, no weak spot was found. Two large blood spears were then thrown out, spinning as fast as possible like a drill. The hope was it would break through the skin, but just like everything else so far, it was a failure as well.

Soon after that, Quinn condensed the blood into whips, now the Behemoth was close again, he leapt up with the condensed blood whips powered with his Qi, and swung them down, dragging it across the beast's body until he had reached the ground, but there was still nothing.

Looking up, the beast's foot was about to land on him. Quinn quickly moved out of the way, letting it hit the ground. 'If long range attacks won't work, then I'll just have to try close range attacks instead.'

Running toward the leg before it lifted, Quinn had made the blood drill in both hands, he threw them with his great physical strength hitting the side of the leg. The larger the beast was the harder they would fall, the only thing was, this beast didn't fall as it was unaffected. He continued to try a number of attacks, the tiger blood pulse attack, just Qi on its own, he even used his shadow and condensed it into a large arm to try and grab the ankle of the beast, but as if there was no resistance at all, the Behemoth continued to lift its leg and continued to walk forward completely ignoring Quinn.

'I've tried to find a weak spot, but I can't find anywhere where the beast will get hurt. It doesn't seem to have a shield nor is it getting its power from somewhere. Is this why they decided that the best thing to do was leave this god slayer be, to just leave it until it died of old age?' Quinn thought.

Not wanting to give up, he had activated his current armour skill.

'With more speed I can generate more power, and I have the time to power up my attack.' Quinn stood his ground as he gathered blood around his finger tips, they were starting to glow bright red. The Behemoth had continued to walk and had gotten a little away from him, but it wasn't far enough. Running at a speed, red pulses of energy were breaking off from Quinn almost every second like a heartbeat.

He continued to run forward and swung his fist to hit the leg. This time, instead of an image of a tiger that would be created from his blood pulse, there was a large floating dragon coming out from his fist made from the blood aura. He punched with all his might the side of the Behemoth, and his nails for the first time had managed to pierce through the skin... the Behemoth could bleed.

However, it lifted its leg up just fine, Quinn's fingertips came out the Behemoth and it continued to move. 'That had everything, my armour, my condensed powers combined into one along with my martial arts... but it still can't defeat it.'

Mundus was watching everything, and he had seen the same sight before, the same despair that Quinn was going through right now. It was the same with the other celestials that had attempted to take the Behemoth down, it was why they had decided to do what they did. 'I wonder how long it will take before he decides to give up? It doesn't look like he will be able to make any progress.'

The look in Quinn's eyes still showed he had hope, because he still had things he wanted to try. 'If large attacks don't work, then maybe large amounts of attacks could work, 1000's of ants could probably take out a human!' Quinn thought, going a bit mad.

Using the shadow, the demon tier beasts were summoned along with a number of other beasts. As long as they were careful about not being trampled on, the Behemoth would ignore them.

"Alright, mass attack time, now!" Quinn ordered.

All of the beasts with their powers and such started to attack the beast. Quinn went back to pummeling the beast with his fists and blood aura, while controlling the swords behind him to strike and do the same. He threw out blood tornados, he threw out blood spears, punches, kicks, everything he could think of while the beasts continued to attack.

This went on for around an hour, with absolutely no sign of progress, and it was then that he had decided to put the beasts back away in his shadow space.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

The Behemoth was still unscathed after an hour of non stop attacks.

'Have you given up?' Alex asked.¬† 'No... I just need to rest a little while I decide what to do.' Quinn responded. Alex could guess what Quinn was contemplating, and he decided it was best to give him the little push he needed. 'Usually I stay out of these things and let you think about these things on your own. But I have to say something. Quinn, don't hold back, no matter what, I think we need to get this crystal.

'Think about it, with how hard it has been to even injure this thing, just think what type of crystal, no... what type of armour, could be made from this. This is something we need.'

This comment made Quinn smile, and just like Alex guessed it had made Quinn make his decision. He leapt up from the ground onto a pillar once more, and looked at the Behemoth. "Since you aren't attacking me no matter what, I guess it won't matter too much, if I will have to use one of the tricks I have up my sleeve.

"Let's see how strong you are."
