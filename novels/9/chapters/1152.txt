Chapter 1153 Layla“s anger

Entering the field, Quinn grasped the sword that was in his hands and made a few practice swings in the air. He looked around, taking everything in as it all felt so real. It was different from playing the VR game Powerfighters. He wasn’t sure if it was due to the mix of VR and AR that had created something extremely special or if it was something else.

’Logan, it looks like you’ve improved something yet again.’ He looked to the side of the arena expecting to see him there, but that’s when Quinn noticed that not only was he missing, but so was Layla.

’Did they both have to go to the toilet at the same time? Judging by Fex’s exaggerated expression I don’t think they went to the toilet.’ Quinn thought. Sound from the outside was emulated into the machine, so Quinn was able to hear the cheers from everyone around, but specific things that they were saying weren’t heard at all.

’I might have to try and finish this quickly.’ Quinn thought as he looked at Longblade on the other side. The field had finished generating, this time it was an open field, with long grass and nothing else.

"It looks like I’m in luck. This is one of my favourite maps to fight on. There is nowhere to hide, and only our skills will decide the outcome of the fight." Longblade thought as he pulled out his blade which was long like a katana. Going by his weapon’s choice he had the feeling that the Colonel and Leo would surely hit it off.

The fight began, and Longblade dashed forward running with his sword down by his side. When he was within range, he struck upwards from below. Pulling back, Quinn was able to avoid the blow that almost grazed his chin.

’This person is good. No wonder he was one of the Head Generals in the past.’ Quinn thought.

To everyone else, they were expecting the fight to have been easy. After the first connection, Longblade would start to deliver the remaining finishing blows, but that wasn’t the case at all. The simulation allowed them to use their beast gear and the stats that were powered within It. However, ’Bucky’ wasn’t wearing any beast gear.

If he did, he would have been able to use the speed of his set to his advantage and could finish the fight in seconds. Quinn had intended to beat him fair and square, hopefully earning the Cursed faction a good reputation during their stay.

Of course, if he had known that Layla and Logan would have gone off, he wouldn’t have cared for that. He had earned his equipment, so Longblade wouldn’t have been able to criticise him for it, still his natural body as a Vampire Lord was fast enough even without it.

After the first strike from Longblade, a few more came after and Quinn blocked each one with his sword. Unlike his opponent he was using a standard long sword. Someone would usually have to wield such a large blade with two hands but Quinn was able to with one. He blocked the swords moving them in place whenever he could see Longblade striking and was being pushed back a bit.

"You’re just relying on your body’s natural reactions, I can tell!" Longblade pointed out. "But you are inexperienced when it comes to holding the sword."

It was true, Quinn didn’t know how to properly parry, or do any of the sort, but his strength and speed allowed him to deflect all those attacks aimed at his vitals. Exchanging blows with him, Quinn could tell that Longblade’s swordsmanship was impressive.

"I have fought against someone who is better with the sword than you. I thought I could learn something, but I guess not." Quinn sighed, as he struck, not holding back as fast as he could towards the side of Longblade.

The attack was too fast for him to react, and he had been hit. With the system emulating the power in the strike Longblade felt the pain and was sent across the field. The only thing he could do to slow down the attack was to dig his blade into the ground.

"How fast was that attack?" Longblade wondered, When looking at the game screen, Quinn saw that the Colonel’s points had only dropped by five. Meaning it wasn’t counted as a lethal blow.

’I see, the system is going to make him recover from this, so it looks like I’m just going to have to hit him a few more times.’ Quinn concluded.

At the same time, Longblade stood up, but he hadn’t lost hope, for he had an ace up his sleeve. The use of abilities wasn’t exactly banned from the match, so there was one thing he could do, as his eyes started to glow.

In the alleyway, a sword was shining brightly as it was covered in flames, but it was doing nothing against his opponent. Logan could feel only a little heat from the sword he was blocking with his Dalki arm. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

"The Cursed faction seem to be just full of monsters!" Agent 11 shouted, as he placed more Qi into his blade making the flames brighten more and was ready to strike again, but then Layla barged forward and struck with her sword. The two powers of Qi clashed, creating vibrations through the air.

"Logan, let me deal with this one!" Layla requested showing off her large teeth. In a close range fight and a battle of strength, her second form was better suited than her third form, and she was just hoping it would be enough.

"Well, little beast, at first I wanted to kill you, but I guess you still might have some use being kept alive! Too bad for you, we don’t need you in one piece!" Agent 11 let out another crazy laugh, as he swung his sword again, managing to cut Layla’s arm. It wasn’t deep as the girl managed to pull back avoiding most of the blow but her body wasn’t healing like it usually would.

’Is this the second stage of Qi?’ Layla wondered, as the clown started to bombard her with his attacks. She knew how to use the second stage of Qi to a certain extent, but she was unable to use it on anything but her arrows. Unfortunately, her arrows were not enough to deal with him, but she wasn’t faring much better with her sword. She wasn’t a master swordsman, either, but he seemed to be quite skilled.

Soon the attacks were building up on her body as she was cut more and more in different places.

’I hardly used the second form, I should have practised with the sword more instead of using my arrows.’ Layla chastised herself, but now was the time for regrets. She knew that would have to wait until after the fight.

The only reason why she was doing okay so far, was because she could still power her sword with the first stage of Qi. Making her strikes powerful. Nonetheless, the difference between the first stage and second stage quickly became apparent.

Coating his sword with the second stage of Qi, he was able to chip at Layla’s sword which was at the King tier level. Both swords were made from the same level of quality crystals, yet Layla’s weapon continued to suffer until, it broke.

"You’re finished!" He shouted.

With nothing else to use, she decided to block the attack with her bare arm. Afraid that something would happen, Qi started to run through her veins and she used what power was in her body to allow it to do so.

Striking forward Agent 11 was going for a clean cut, but instead his sword was left there stuck in place.

’What is going on, is the Qi in her body really this strong? Strong enough to even block my second stage and when using a weapon.’

Layla didn’t know how her bones and flesh were able to withstand the sword, but the sword was slipping deeper and deeper into her by the second and something had to be done.

Jumping back, Layla pulled out an arrow from behind, she held onto two of them like a spear. In the desperate situation she threw both of them towards Agent 11 who was confident enough to dive right in. He went to strike and block the blows but the power of the Qi was more than he had expected, getting pushed back before he could further injure it.

’How is that possible? I hate to admit it, but somehow her Qi is actually stronger than mine. I’ve only had the advantage because I know the second stage, but she can actually use it in her arrows to some extent.’

Changing the shape of his Qi, he was able to redirect the arrows, but when he was ready to, he felt something slice the back of his ankles causing him to fall to the floor. The next second, pain shot from the front of both his feet.

Looking down, he saw that the blade that had broken, she was controlling it with her telekinesis and used it to attack the back of his foot while he was distracted, and now lifting the two half into the air, she slammed them down on his foot, and they had pierced the front as well.

’But how? I’m wearing beast gear, and have the power of Qi running through my body.’

The next second, Agent 11 was constricted by the body of a serpent, as it wrapped around him. His body was getting crushed by muscles stronger than he had felt before, and on the tail end of it, he could see a beautiful woman.

’This Qi! It’s as powerful as the first digits! And that attack just now... did she infuse the blade with the second stage as well... is that... how she hurt...’ Before he could finish his thought, Agent 11 had passed out and Layla left him on the ground. Having exhausted a lot of her strength, the girl turned back into her usual self, but she could barely stand as she knelt up against the wall.

’I did it! I was able to beat a single high ranking double digit agent that was able to use Qi, by using my own Qi. I have improved... Shit, Logan.’ Layla suddenly remembered that she wasn’t alone. Turning around, she saw that Logan was having hardly any trouble dealing with the other agents, and now that their leader had been subdued on the floor, they decided that fleeing the area was the better choice than continuing to fight against Logan.

`We already have the highest ranking one, and I’m sure there are other Pure members out there. It’s better to fall back.’ Logan decided. The spiders started to form and collect over his Dalki arm once more. They took the broken parts from the floor and started to fix it in place covering it once more.

Then the spiders soon moved to the Agent who was left passed out on the floor, and they started to cover his legs in place, and surround his body as well.

"He’s an agent of the Pure I’m assuming. I can only imagine that group causing you to act so reckless...." Logan was about to give Layla a lecture about her stupid act, but he decided to postpone it. She had done well in the fight, and she was obviously exhausted.

"Let’s take him back to Quinn. With his powers he’s the best person to interrogate him." Logan said. "If we hurry, we might be able to make it in time to see him humiliate Longblade!"
