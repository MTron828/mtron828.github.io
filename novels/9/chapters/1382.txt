Chapter 1383 - The Leaders Growth (Part 1)

It wasn't long after the meeting, that an announcement was made to the whole settlement about the King's two new Royal Knights. There was no big ceremony, Quinn had felt like they had had enough of those recently.

Every time they had a ceremony it seemed to delay things. He didn't understand what all the big huff was about, but according to Vincent, when vampires had lived for 1000s of years and had done nearly everything, an excuse for a celebration or something for them to do was welcomed.

He still disregarded this fact because now they did have something important to do, and thought it was just best to deliver the news to the leaders, allowing them to pass on the message. Although none of the vampires disagreed with Quinn's decision to make Muka a Royal knight, they considered him a good choice‚Ä¶her a good choice. They did though, wonder why someone like Fex had been chosen.

In the end, the people believed that it was due to him being close to the King. There were those vampires, who believed their leaders should have rightfully obtained the position and complained a little, yet the ones in the pooling area were okay with this. It seemed like the inner castle vampires were the ones kicking up the most fuss.

The Pooling vampires were still over the moon that Quinn had accepted to be their King in the first place, and they thought whoever he selected for the positions were the right choice. They just saw his actions through rose-colored glasses, where whatever he did couldn't be seen as wrong to them.

Then, there was a more tricky announcement, and it was for the tenth family. For this one, Quinn did decide to gather the people, because he wanted to gauge their initial reaction. Just like with the leaders, he didn't want to hide anything from his people as well.

They stopped on top of a balcony that led out from the castle, and all the vampires belonging to the tenth family were invited. They stood outside looking upward. As Quinn came out the usual roar and cheers were heard, and then when Vincent was revealed there were audible gasps in the crowd.

"Is it his twin? The tenth leader had a twin we never knew about?!"

"It must just be someone with an ability, right?"

In the end, Quinn decided it was best for him to speak first.

"As you all know, I have taken up the role to be your King, which means in my place someone else will have to take care of the tenth family. Leo will continue to be your Knight, as for the other position, I will be leaving that decision to my successor, although it might be more accurate to call him my predecessor.

"Due to some special circumstances we have provided him with a new body." Quinn explained. "This here is Vincent Eno, the former leader of the tenth family."

There was whispering from the crowd, even if most of the vampires weren't around when Vincent had been their leader, they still knew the tenth family's history and he had been branded a traitor as a leader that had abandoned them at a crucial time, making the other families treat them like scum.

"Boo boo!"

There was great negativity from the crowd at the mention of that name, and Quinn was worried that any second the people might start to chuck things at them.

"Do you want me to say a few things to them?" Vincent asked. "They have a right to be upset."

"No!" Quinn quickly said, remembering what had happened when he had chosen to speak during that council meeting. It was one thing for the other leaders to dislike him, but for the ones he was supposed to lead would be a disaster.

"Everyone quite!" Quinn yelled, amplifying his voice with Qi. "I know of Vincent's past, in fact his blood runs through my veins, but you also don't know what he has been doing while he was away.

"It was because of Vincent that I was able to become who I am today! He guided me, taught me how to use my Blood powers and more. He was even the one that asked me to help you all! If it wasn't for him, then you wouldn't have me here today either!"

The vampires didn't know if these words were true, but what seemed to somewhat convince them, was the fact that Vincent now looked identical to Quinn. They couldn't imagine what he had been through that would make it so he had to be that way.

"In the end, if you are not happy with this decision, then I ask you to blame me who made this decision!" Quinn demanded.

It was then, a few seconds later that the crowd started to cheer, although it wasn't as joyous or as loud as they had done in the past, and seemed to be more done of obligations than true feelings.

"It looks like you have a lot to make up for, Vincent. Maybe try to be a good leader for them in this lifetime." Quinn advised. "And put some thought into picking your next knight."

There were a few choices that Quinn had in mind, such as Timmy, who had Edwards power and knowledge, Xander who had potential to grow stronger every time he saw him and lastly Ashley, Who worked closest under Paul. He was also a bright talent that was improving quicker than most.

Still, it just felt right to leave it up to Vincent, since they would technically be working under him, while Vincent would work for Quinn.

"I wasn't a bad leader in the first place.'' Vincent sighed. "They just forgot everything I did for them before I left. It only takes one bad thing to make others forget about all the good you have done beforehand‚Ä¶"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

All of the leaders had been called to the 8th inner castle area. After thinking about how to use it for a while Quinn had come up with an idea. The King wanted to use the empty area as a training ground. The leaders having strong powers would cause destruction wherever they trained and that included their own castles.

In an area like this, that wouldn't matter though. The area had changed somewhat since the leaders had last come here, and they couldn't help but stare at the empty space and the large platforms that had been created.

"How were you able to do this so fast?" Sunny asked. Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

"The same way I improved the settlement. I can control everything as I wish, take down buildings, move things and create new structures, it's pretty amazing, right?" Quinn grinned, but soon blushed as he realised that it made it sound as if even he himself was amazed by his own skills. Of course he was, because he still couldn't believe what the system allowed him to do, but he understood that as a good King he was supposed to appear calm and dignified,

The leaders stood on top of one of the large platforms. By Quinn's side were Muka and Fex. He would have liked Vincent by his side as well, but he thought that would appear as clear favoritism, so his ancestor was currently standing amongst the other leaders.

"Alright, so from now on, we are going to use this area to train. You don't need to tell me how useless you all were against Laxmus. Use this chance to learn so that you can repay him yourself for everything he had done to the vampire settlement!" Quinn shouted.

It was strange for the leaders to hear these words. They were the strongest vampires in the settlement, and they had hardly ever heard themselves being called useless, but compared to Quinn they truly did feel that way.

"You guys need to get better or stronger at fighting, This whole time a lot of you have been lazy. So there will be two things we are focusing on. One Fex will show you all how to summon your inner blood weapon, and two I want the leaders to fight against each other and improve, and I want you to especially go hard, against Vincent." Quinn grinned.
