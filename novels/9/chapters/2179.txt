While being transported Quinn of course wondered what Mundus meant by really need? He could only guess he was talking about the armour. There were a few times where Mundus had stated that these God Slayers he had selected were due to him believing that they were the best choice.

However, if Quinn was unable to get the god slayer crystal, almost like they had done on the last planet, he believed Mundus could always just take them to another God Slayer. Did this mean it wasn't an option, that he needed to defeat this opponent no matter what?

'Well, at least we aren't on the Phoenix planet anymore that's for sure.' Quinn thought. He was only confused last time due to the drastic temperature change without the Phoenix, it was dropping in heat fast after the it had died.

In front of him, there was a dark atmosphere, most of his fights had been during the day, but this planet was covered in darkness. It was hard to tell if it was due to it just being night time, or because the clouds above were so thick, it almost looked like it let no light in. Apart from the lighting that would come out from the clouds from time to time lighting up the area here and there.

Looking at his feet, Quinn noticed that he was standing on what could only be described as a large pillar. They were high up in the air, and could see far and wide across the land. From what he could see there looked to be large lakes of water, but they were filled with a dark sludge of sorts. The strangest thing were the random large pillars made from the ground.

It was hard to tell if they were intentionally made and put there, as they weren't perfect in shape, meanwhile they were spread across the entire area. Standing tall like skyscrapers.¬ß

"This doesn't look like a nice place." Quinn commented.

"Look at the beasts that are here, can you tell that they are different?" Mundus asked.

Looking around, although there seemed to be no signs of intelligent life of the sort. At least not a civilization like the last planet, unlike the Phoenix planet there were plenty of beasts. They were giant in size, far bigger than the usual beasts Quinn would come across who were already large.

What he was looking at, nearly all of them were no smaller than the Dragon the Dalki had been made from, and nearly all of them looked to be just ferocious.

'Take a look at them, there must be something I'm missing?'

It was a habit now, it had become second nature for Quinn to just use the inspect skill on everything he could see to gather as much information as possible. There was no need to even select the skill from the system anymore he just thought about the skill and information would pop up there and then.

"It can't be, this is crazy!" Quinn thought as he looked at them all. "Every single one of those beasts are really at the Demon tier?"

He had been on planets before where there were a high amount of Demon tier beasts, but this was nothing compared to those. Every beast that was roaming around was at the Demon tier. If there were those that knew about this planet, he was sure that multiple races would be fighting over calming it, but with so many dangerous monsters, could they even take it?

"I guess that means, this time I will be going up against a god slayer beast rather than a human type?" Quinn asked, even though the answer was obvious.

"With every opponent you have faced I have given you an amount of information that will assist you, but not help sway the fight in any way, and I shall do the same now." Mundus explained.

"Yes, the one you will be fighting is a beast that has thrived on this planet. A planet where there are strong enemies left and right, but even here, in a place like this, there is one that has managed to reside above all.ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

"I want you to imagine for a second what that would take, what type of beast would be able to do such a thing, and your answer is right here on this planet. We have given it the nickname king of beasts."

Hearing this, Quinn thought that maybe Ray, who claimed to be king of the dragons which was a type of beast, would have to disagree with that. Although, whether or not Dragons were beasts was another thing to think about all together.

From what he had heard, they seemed to be more so a separate existence. Not quite fitting in any category, at least that was true for Ray.

"Due to this, the official God Slayer has been called King Behemoth." Mundus continued. "The beast is so large that when it moves, the whole planet shakes due to its weight and force. It towers over these pillars as if they were nothing."

Quinn didn't know if Mundus was exaggerating or not, was it even possible for a beast to be so heavy, or so dense in nature it would shake the planet. Wouldn't that mean it would have its own gravitational force as well.

Now he wished he had paid a bit more attention in his classes at school, but it didn't change any of the facts of what he would have to face.

"The Behemoth is a creature who seems to withstand anything. All of our attempted attacks had ended in failure, but not because they had perished, it was because they simply couldn't do any real harm to the beast.

"It was a matter that was put up on the ladder of importance, and either Myself or maybe even an Ancient one would have to deal with this, but in the end they classified this god slayer as unimportant.

"For one, the god Slayer is unable to leave the planet. It has no skills to do so, and there is no life on the planet that can help it do so. So we simply decided that the best thing to do would be to wait it out. Wait until the beast dies of natural causes, but strong beasts can live up to 1000 and 1000 of years, with some getting even stronger.

"There are yet to be any signs of this beast slowing down. If i'm honest, I really see it hard for you to beat this one, even with all of your strength. You might need to even pass and give up, but I believe that if you do manage to kill it, and obtain its God Slayer crystal, it will be the strongest component to your armour set."

There were a lot of words, one that made the God Slayer seem just as powerful as those before it, but where was the god slayer? With that question in mind, Quinn could feel the whole ground beneath him move.
