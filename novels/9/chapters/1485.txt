Chapter 1486 - Just Do It!

"Oh my." Were the only words that came out of Muka's mouth upon seeing Hayley's appearance. She had let go of Fex and covered her mouth with one of her hands, and it was one of the very few times when her actions felt womanly.

At the same time, Fex was also awkwardly staring while trying to look away as the Succubus crossed her legs as if she was desperately holding herself from peeing.

"Quinn, you have to do something, don't let her stay in pain!" Fex shouted, holding up his hands in front of his face but at the same time was looking through the finger gaps.

"Uhh‚Ä¶do something? What do you mean by 'do something'?" Quinn stood frozen. He was beyond useless and practically dead weight in this situation, and Muka also knew it.

'Besides, if they are thinking what I think they're thinking, it wouldn't work, right? I mean the bond thing between a turner and the one they create. Although‚Ä¶it did say something about bypassing that type of thing in the system message.

'And‚Ä¶ I can still touch Layla. That bond only seems to activate when I feel something. What am I doing? It's like I'm making excuses for why I can do it rather than not!'

Muka was the first one to act. She felt sorry for the young lady and ran across like a hero lifting Hayley on her back and carrying her over her shoulder. It looked like she was getting ready to run out of the room to head to a place that was a little more private than this.

"You two follow me; we need to solve this issue," Muka said, running off. Quinn and Fex looked at each other for a second before immediately following her, leaving everyone in the room who had overheard the conversation to wonder what was going on.

"Did you hear that groan?" One of them asked.

Eventually, the three of them had entered a medium-sized room. It was quite fancy inside and similar to a hotel. Everything was clean, untouched, and even a large bed was there. Quinn speculated that this room was most probably prepared for one of the board members to catch a nap or two during their meetings.

He felt like they were lucky to even have the luxury to sleep in a place like this during these times.

Muka placed Hayley on the bed and covered her with a blanket. But Hayley began to toss and turn as her horn grew, although a lot slower than before.

Since no one was around, Muka had taken off her helmet, revealing her face. This time her hair was of nice violet colour, making Quinn wonder if she had dyed it, or he didn't notice it before. He was also naturally drawn to staring at her perfect face, which was even more breathtaking than the beautiful vampires.

It was almost impossible even to describe her, as her face had a look to it like no other.

"You are a troublemaker, aren't you?" Muka giggled. "Creating a succubus of all things."

"Why is she like this?" Quinn asked. "What can we do to help her, or will it eventually pass?"

Fex was pacing up and down the room. For him, it seemed like it was a stressful moment. But there was a slight smile on his face as if he was relishing this, while Quinn was just full of concern and worry.

"I have some knowledge about them," Muka answered, walking over to Hayley, who was still tossing and turning. "When a succubus is first turned, her lust is at its peak, and it's similar to how a newborn vampire reacts upon seeing blood for the first time.

"However, certain things bring this on more to them during this time, for example, men. To them, seeing men would make them feel like how a newborn vampire feels upon seeing a cut on human skin. However, something could worsen this situation even further, and that is Virgin men. It would be like the sweetest blood you have ever tasted dangled in front of the vampires."

It was then that Muka gave a slight glance towards Quinn. It was as if she was asking a question without saying it, and finally, Fex couldn't hold it in anymore as he laughed.

"Hey man, you kinda deserve this and don't look at me. I'm not the one who made her like this."

Quinn's face was turning bright red by the second. It wasn't that he didn't have any interest in women, but when did he have the time for all this? Besides, there were plenty of girls interested in him, and he could have done the deed with any of them, but hey, saving his friends and the world had always been, well, the main priority.

"I guess it's best if Fex and I leave the room? That should solve the problem, right?" Quinn asked.

"Don't you dare, Quinn!" Hayley shouted from her bed. She had lifted her head up, and while she was still red and steaming, she said, "You caused this problem which means you're going to solve it."

"Well, you heard her." Fex patted his friend on the back. "I guess I should leave. This is a perfect room, and she's a good looking woman. All I can say is I hope for the best for you two!"

"Wait! When did I agree to this? Why can't you do it since this all comes naturally to you?" Quinn asked.

"I have Samantha now; I can't cheat on her this soon into a relationship. It would never work out. Besides, I have to help her learn the ropes because someone has created a headache. Don't worry, I won't tell Layla about this, and didn't you say that the two of you couldn't do it anyway? I'm sure even if she finds out, I am sure she will understand."

Fex was already heading out the door, and it looked like Muka was as well. She placed her helmet back on her head and gave a thumbs up towards Quinn.

"I will stay on guard and make sure no one comes inside. Don't worry. I will try not to listen." Muka said as the door was slammed shut.

Now the only ones in the room were Quinn and Hayley. Although Quinn was nineteen years old and an adult, he didn't know how and where to start. However, there was one experience he could draw from, and that was from Vincent's life. It was ironic that Quinn never wanted to try and remember the details.

"Hey, Hayley, does it really have to be me? Don't you have a boyfriend that we can call over? Or I can ask one of the vampire soldiers that doesn't have anyone. Think how awkward it would be between the two of us. I don't think I can even touch you, and the age difference?" Quinn asked, stepping back.

"Age difference?" Hayley asked as she began to unbutton her tight shirt from the top one by one, revealing her clear skin and the top of her large breasts. "I'm only twenty-seven, and Quinn, think about everything you have done.

"You have done so much; this should be nothing for someone like you. This is an easy task, so just please help me!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Outside the room, Fex had decided to leave after some time. Muka was enough to stay in guard, not that they thought anyone would come by anyway. Still, he had a smile that wouldn't settle down. He wasn't happy about Samantha's situation, and now he felt like he had gotten his revenge back somehow.

Little did he know that fate had a strange way of working because after leaving the hallway and entering back in the reception room they were just in, someone approached him.

"Hey, Fex, have you seen Quinn? I was just speaking to Sam, and he said that you ran off with him earlier. I wanted to talk to him about something." It was Layla.

'Why do I have a sudden urge to really try and cause some drama today.' Fex smiled mischievously.
