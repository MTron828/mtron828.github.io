 There was no reason for the champion Calva to lie, to lie about the fact that Quinn was indeed a demon. Not unless he just wanted to stir trouble, but the Skullys had more reason to believe him than to not. 

After all, they all had their doubts when they first saw Quinn. An inhabitant that they had never come across before, of course that was possible the world was incredibly large, but one that was this strong appearing out of nowhere. 

The most likely answer was that it was a demon, and one that was going against the demon kings and Immortui.

"He's a demon… then even if he defeats the demon king, won't he just end up replacing him?" Tuni said. "Then, it's just going to be the same again."

Ekeke and Tuni were clearly disheartened by this fact, but for Anon he felt differently. 

'Calva can maybe sense the demons better than us, especially since he went against so many of them in the past. 

'But even if Quinn is a demon does that matter? The words he spoke before, when he said he wished to kill the Immortui, I could feel it, his anger, it's just as strong as ours, and his determination, it's probably above ours as well.' 

"I… I want you to help him." Anon said. "As part of the deal, if we get you out of here, then I want you to help him. Even if he is weak, even if he is hurt after this fight, you are not to attack him." 

"Wait, you want him to help another demon, you're asking too much!" Ekeke argued. 

Before, when they were unsure whether or not Quinn was a demon it was fine, but now they knew what he was, it was hard for them to stomach. The demons were what ruined everything, so then why would they want to help one, even if they were temporarily on their side.

"There has to be a reason why he helped us." Anon answered, clenching his fist. "Think about it, he could have killed us at any point and time, yet he saved us. No, not just us, but he saved countless Skullys' lives that are all back there in the forest. 

"He even saved us, by hitting us away in the middle of the fight, before it had even started. He had no reason to do any of that. If you ask me, he has done a lot more than even Calva had done back in the past."

Calva had a large smirk on his face, he never thought he would meet a Skully that was so brave to say words like that in front of his face, even if he was tied up. He wasn't angry though, because the words were true. What did he care?

"I'll leave the decision up to you, whether you think it's smart or not to attempt to unbind me." Calva said. "In the first place, is it even something possible that you guys can do, and if you are successful, how do you even know if I will keep my word, there is nothing that will force or bind me to do such a thing, only our word."

This was the part where Anon was struggling, would Calva feel indebted to them for breaking him free. Was he a person of his word, there was too little known about him, and the way he was acting now, it wasn't giving them a large amount of confidence.

The two shadow clones, when coming close to the tornado of crystal shards that were as small as glitter, started to use their shadow powers. They were so stronger than they were before due to the boost that the real Quinn had given them.

Making a fist, it started to grow larger with the shadow around it and when close to the mist tornado of crystals the fist was thrown out and a giant shadow hand was created, spread out larger than that of the crystals. 

As it hit the outside of it, a large bulk of the crystals had stopped, and this was true for the other side as well as the other clone was doing the same. However, the crystals almost seemed to have a mind of their own, as if they were a swarm of bees. 

Seeing how touching the strong shadow stopped them from advancing, part of the tornado of crystals that had yet to touch the shadow went around the side and went straight for the shadow body. 

The crystals moved fast and due to how small they were, it was hard for even the clones to keep track of where every single one was. They used more of their shadow powers to block what they could see but small parts were attacking them. 

The shadow bodies were doing well, blocking small parts of the crystal, but it looked like eventually they would get through. 

The real Quinn was rushing through the air, toward the falling demon king, but now that it wasn't getting hit, it was able to act. From its body, large chunks of the crystal were being chucked out. 

With two of his large fists, Quinn swung out, hitting the crystals away. It didn't take long for Quinn to be within a close range of Kronker and could see the large bladed hands heading his way. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lifting up two of his hands Quinn grabbed onto the sword, while with a third he punched the side knocking it away. Similarly with the other bladed hand Quinn was able to kick the air and immediately went in the other direction and three of his fists hit at the other bladed hand, the entirety of Kronker's arm was swung back. 

However, Kronker had somewhat expected this and was ready to fire his crystals away from his chest, only there was no target for him to hit. Out from a portal behind his head, all six hands raised above his head the vampire god slayer slammed all six of his fists on the top of the crystallised head. I think you should take a look at

Several waves of blood aura were sent with it, and Kronker went through the air heading straight to the ground. The attack had a second boost, slamming him into the ground even further. 

Not checking on the condition of what the demon king would be in, Quinn wasted no time, as he started to throw his fists one after the other, again and again, throwing out blood fist after blood fist right where Kronker had fallen. 

The ground was cracking more and more, it was spreading wider as Kronker was sent deeper and deeper into the ground from all of the hits. 

From the side, the glitter like crystals had appeared, forming into a shield. They were blocking off the majority of the punches. 

'Seeing how his strange defence has come back, that means the clones have been defeated.' Quinn thought, and he was right. 

Still, his attacks, his powers, his abilities were all getting through to the demon king, and he was chipping away bit by bit. As he fell through the sky, Quinn created a shadow portal sending him back down to the ground and away from Kronker. 

He was most cautious about the small crystals. They were so fine in size that he believed that there was a chance he could even breathe such a thing in, and then it would affect him greatly. 

From the large crater that had been made in the ground, movement could be heard. It was no surprise that Kronker had survived those attacks, because he had survived everything else so far, but as he stood up there were large differences in his appearance . 

There were multiple cracks on the crystals all over his body, and a few shards looked to have even fallen off.

"F*ck, F*Ck, F*Ck!" Kronker screamed. "How could a new demon type do this to me!  You, you forced my hand. There's a big difference between me and you, you're a fake, us demon kings, we are true demons. You will never be able to achieve the pinnacle of what we can do. I will show you!!!"

The eyes of the Durum started to glow, and rather than the energy from the outside world heading towards where he was, a dark rippling red and black aura started to ripple out from Kronker's body. 

It spread out in the air, pushing it away, spreading out across the floor. It was changing the entire area around them, making them feel like they had moved to a different world all together once again.

'He's transforming… that's what this is… does this mean they have a form, just like me?' Quinn wondered, and wondered just how much stronger the demon king would be. 

The energy that was spread through the air and the ground had reached him, and as it did, he felt his heart thump almost ten times stronger than it did before. The energy on the floor was being absorbed by his feet, without him willing it to. 

[Demon energy detected]

[The demon energy within you is running rampant]

[Demon transformation will now begin.]
