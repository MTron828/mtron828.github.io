Chapter 1187 Ongoing quests

After learning that the blood weapons were already complete, Quinn got ready to travel to where Alex was. Most of those that had stayed with Alex on the planet, carried the Shadow ability making it easy for Quinn to get to where he needed to be.

Due to Quinn‚Äôs request being complete, he messaged them beforehand, telling them to turn their shadow active skill on. Since there were multiple shadow users, any one of them would do, but there was a reason why they didn‚Äôt just leave them on all the time either. Since Quinn could travel to anyone with the Shadow ability at any point and time, it also meant that Arthur could do the same.

Nobody wanted for the original Punisher to suddenly appear in front of them.

Quinn soon appeared next to Alex. There were around two hundred blood weapons consisting of all types of different weapons, all laid out across the floor on pieces of cloth in his foraging room, each one crafted with care.

"Impressive, right? I think my right arm grew about two times its size making all of these." Alex declared proudly, picking up a mace and demonstrating a few swings. "And don‚Äôt worry I haven‚Äôt been slacking on your Demon tier weapon. Well technically it will be a Demon tier accessory. It‚Äôs just with the crystal each process takes a long time, so during the waiting periods I managed to do all of these."

Hearing this, Quinn was worried about whether Alex had even gotten a wink of sleep, but looking around he could see that the forger had recruited a few helpers from amongst the Orbus faction.

Quinn picked up one of the blood weapon swords and used his Inspect skill on it.

[Made with a medium grade blood crystal]

[Not active]

[+10 strength]

[+ 3 agility]

Looking at a few more of the blood weapons, Quinn was wondering how much they would help with the situation the others were in. The weapons had a mixture of three different types of crystal. T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

Low, Medium and High. Quinn assumed that there might be higher crystal tiers, just none out of the batch that had been given to him, Depending on the quality of the crystal used the weapon would naturally have better stats, but they were still substandard when compared to beast weapons.

However, as soon as Quinn poured some blood from his flask on top of one of the weapons, things changed. The Strength boost it provided nearly doubled in power and a couple even received very interesting active skills. It was an amazing effect, unfortunately it only lasted until the blood energy on the weapon ran out.

"These weapons don‚Äôt seem to be the optimal choice when hunting beasts, but they should prove useful for going up against the Dalki." Quinn concluded, putting his hand out above them all.

"You could always tell them how they work. Even if they run out of blood packs, people could always start using their own blood to fight." Alex suggested. As long as Quinn explained these weapons, they might become more popular, but the Cursed faction leader was worried that people might think this was some type of vampire curse he was using to trick them to get their blood.

Unfortunately, he couldn‚Äôt really blame them. If he was in their shoes he might be thinking the same. The Cursed faction had just gained some positive reputation, it would be unfortunate to lose it so soon again.

The next second, all of the weapons disappeared into Quinn‚Äôs dimensional space. He was the best person to quickly transport them where they were needed. His next stop was to head off to meet up with Helen on one of the Cursed faction planets, yet before he did there was one last thing he wanted to do.

"Before I forget, do you happen to have any more blood crystals left over?" Quinn asked.

"Did you need one? Oh damn! I‚Äôm sorry but I used them all up. I thought we needed the weapons, so I concentrated on making as many as I could. It was already hard to forge the ones you collected with those crystals and I didn‚Äôt want to waste any of them." Alex replied, worried he might have ruined Quinn‚Äôs plans.

"It‚Äôs no problem, I was merely curious about something. You did a great job creating all of those!" Quinn replied, giving him a smile. Once Alex was done with the Demon tier beast gear, he had to make sure to reward the forger adequately.

When touching the blood weapon, Quinn had tried to use the gauntlet to absorb some energy from inside it. Unfortunately, nothing had happened when he did. He had been hoping that it might allow him to increase his blood energy.

It seemed impossible to do so with a processed blood crystal, yet he had no way to try it out with a raw one. It was a shame that they had all been used up. Unlike beast crystals, blood crystals were nearly impossible to get his hands on.

He borrowed a ship and headed off into space. The Cursed faction planets were closer to this one, so it made more sense for Quinn to travel this way. It felt a bit strange, to go out alone for a change. In fact, many people had offered to come with Quinn, especially Vorden.

Having been out of the loop for so long, he had practically begged to be taken along. Quinn would have loved to accede his request, but bringing along a humanoid beast was just a magnet for all kinds of trouble.

In the end, Quinn didn‚Äôt really see the reason why anyone had to come with him this time. There was to be no fighting, no large enemy, Quinn was just going for more political reasons than anything. He didn‚Äôt even think he was going to be there long if need be.

Due to this, he had taken a small spacecraft, but there was still ample room for him to move about in, and a kitchen as well as a toilet area. After setting the ship on autopilot, Quinn moved to the centre of the room, and pulled out the indestructible sword.

‚ÄôThe passive skill on this sword, being unbreakable, really suits my style a lot. Due to my strength and my surge in Qi, I‚Äôm not sure how many swords could take my full strength. Especially if I was to go up against things like that Demon tier crab.‚Äô

Soon Quinn closed his eyes and started to focus on his Qi. He was careful not to overuse it and made sure to keep a perfect balance between the two powers inside of him, before he decided to slowly increase the Qi output to the blade itself.

‚ÄôWhen fighting with Agent 2, I learned something. Channelling Qi into a blade is probably the best choice, especially with the second stage of Qi since a person can sharpen and elongate their weapon when needed.‚Äô

"While, my gauntlets are powered by my blood abilities. Hand to hand combat is best for this explosive power." Quinn threw out a punch while imagining it in his head.

‚ÄôBoth of these powers are useful in their own situations, and mixing them has its benefits as well. Maybe if I learned how to use the sword decently it could improve my Qi powers. At least while my Qi is stronger than my blood powers it may be something I need to look into.‚Äô Quinn thought, as he started to swing the sword a few times, picturing some of the moves he had seen Leo do before.

He was able to imitate them quite well, but training on his own and using them in battle were two different things altogether. While thinking about improving his sword abilities, Quinn took a chance to check out how all of his current stats were doing at the moment.

[Level 67]

With each level up Quinn was still gaining one stat, but the exp requirement was now a number larger than Quinn could even figure out with just one glance. It seemed like the only way to level up was through hard Quests, and by putting himself in dangerous situations.

[Strength 71]

[Agility 70]

[Stamina 73]

[Charm 60]

[Blood control 184]

These were Quinn‚Äôs regular stats without the aid of equipment. Of course when powering his body with the first stage of Qi, although the number didn‚Äôt change his body would get a boost on top of this, and there was also the legendary tier set that he had.

For now, Quinn was planning to upgrade his strength as high as possible. Due to the set, he already had agility points beyond the point where it felt like he was actually getting to move any faster. He also still had the active skill.

If anyone was fast enough to react or put a stop to that someway, Quinn felt like a single stat point here or there wouldn‚Äôt change the outcome.

Next, Quinn looked at his blood abilities.

[Blood swipe level 5]

[Blood spray Level 5]

[Crescent kick level 4]

[Blood wall Level 3]

[Blood bank level 3]

[Blood bullet level 3]

After reaching level five with his Blood swipe skill, he had also unlocked Blood barrage, it was the same with Blood spray which made a new move.

[Blood barrage level 1]

[Blood shotgun level 1]

On top of this, Quinn could use Blood control to the degree where he could perform moves such as the Blood drill, and could combine attacks creating a blood hammer strike and such, but these weren‚Äôt skills that could level up, and seemed to increase in strength depending on Quinn‚Äôs blood control level. This was also true for Blood Harding as well.

Then lastly there were Quinn‚Äôs shadow abilities.

[Shadow control level 4]

[Shadow cloak level 4]

[Shadow void level 3]

[Shadow equip level 5]

[Shadow eater even 1]

[Shadow hop]

[Shadow path level 2]

[Shadow On]

[Shadow link]

[Shadow sink]

[Shadow clone]

They were powerful on their own, but they were even stronger than he combined them together, such as when he was using Shadow control and Blood swipe able to create the Shadow scythes.

He also had created the Shadow disks, that worked great with his soul weapon shadow overload, and there were still skills he had yet to perfect or find the right time to use, from the tablet he had discovered at the fourteenth casele.

After finishing looking at his stats, the last thing he wanted to do was look at his ongoing Quests that were yet to be completed.

[Become the Vampire King]

Quinn was a bit surprised the Quest hadn‚Äôt been marked failed, after Bryce got elected as the King. Was he supposed to wait until the next election... or did his Quest want him to usurp the position?

[Learn about the Talen family]

Quinn would love to solve this one, but so far he only had that strange symbol and the black sword. Hopefully, bringing it to the tablet might reveal more. He was becoming more curious as he found more things related to his seemingly normal family.

Then there was the last ongoing Quest.

[Discover something beyond the Vampire Lord]

Were it not for the separate Vampire King Quest, Quinn would have believed that to be the thing ‚Äôbeyond‚Äô a Vampire Lord. However, since he had received this one as well, there should be something else. Did the System want him to become an Original... or something else entirely?

Whatever the case, Quinn had no idea how to go about it, or how close he might be to achieving it. Right now, he noticed that a planet came into his view.
