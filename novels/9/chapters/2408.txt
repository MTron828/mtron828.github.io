The time had finally come for both Hikel and Chris to not hold back. They were unable to in this situation, and the first thing that Hikel did after he transformed was unleash his blood aura into the air. 

It went up like an arrow crushing up high out of the pit. He had covered his whole body in aura as if trying to perform some type of ritual while sending only the top bit out of the pit. 

Meanwhile, Chris had fully transformed into his werewolf form. Him being a naturally tall and large person meant that his werewolf form was taller as well. Next to these werewolves in the red space, Chris found himself around the same size as them, only they were of a different shape with a far bigger upper body. Yet for some reason, Chris didn't look any lesser than them, especially with the armour that was covering his body.

It was mainly chest and shoulder guards, allowing his arms to freely come out and be on display.

"This." Unzoku said, looking at Chris in particular. Although he was curious about the energy that had come from Hikel, he was far more fascinated by Chris, because he knew exactly what he was. 

With his large nose, Unzoku took a sniff for a few times. Even if his eyes would fail him then he was sure that his sense of smell wouldn't.

"You are… I thought they had all disappeared in the golden space. If I had known, then I would have tried making contact with you earlier. Makes me wonder if you are from the other side, and looking at you, I wonder what bloodline you are from?" Unzoku asked. 

Chris was hesitant to go in for the first attack, due to the army of werewolves that were around him. However, he was even more confused by what Unzoku was even saying. 

'I guess, our similarities in appearance, he must know a lot more about this werewolf stuff than me, not that I could care less. I was forced into having this type of body, and all I need to do is use it to get out of this situation.' Chris thought.

This was no time for standing around as it looked like the others had made their first move, and by others it was the group of deadly werewolves that had transformed. They began to run across the floor, their limbs being a lot looser than before. 

The legs seemed to be the driver in their movement, as their arms dragged across the floor, but as they did they made quite deep scratches along the floor.

"How do you want to divide this up?" Hikel asked.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Chris looked at the werewolves, the big guy and also the Champion. They all looked too much and there was a lot for him to deal with. Due to his powers he felt like he only had two options. 

"I… have a feeling that the big wolf might go easy on me, it seems he has a lot of questions for me, so there might be something I can find out!" Chris dashed forward.

He was heading right towards the werewolves that were coming at him, and he was a little bit faster than them. With each step, as Chris got closer, he was starting to feel something. His heart was thumping stronger, not in a painful way either. With each beat, a surge of energy was sent out to his body all the way to his finger tips. His senses, his muscles, everything felt lighter and sharper. 

Never before, when fighting, had he felt like this, it was almost similar to an adrenaline rush, or the fourth stage of Qi he would use, but he wasn't currently using that either. 

Unzoku was watching things carefully wondering how this could be. 

For one, based on the form, and the evolution that Chris currently was at as a werewolf, he didn't look like he would be faster than his Glutton class werewolves he had created for the red space. 

Werewolves, just like vampires, could also evolve, but when they did, they evolved into different classes. These classes at times had quite a bit of differences from each other, from the way a werewolf would look, to their abilities, and even certain speaking traits. 

The Glutton class werewolf was a class that could be offered to only a few that would meet the requirements. Due to the nature of the red world, and how Unzoku wished to create a powerful army, every werewolf that was in the red world, apart from himself of course, was of the Glutton class.

Although Chris was a werewolf, he had originally thought he was just that, yet it had selected his class. After all, it was quite clear based on the power that was coming from him that he hadn't done werewolf things per se.I think you should take a look at

'The grey fur and the strength that's rising with him. This is not good, I should have noticed it sooner, this means he's a shapeshifter class, and the special trait of the shapeshifters is a boost in power the more werewolves there are in the area. A werewolf class that is meant to come out on top compared to the others.'

For a moment, Unzoku thought of the worst that could happen, but he quickly disregarded that fact. His werewolves had just received a boost in power from him, and they had been feasting on the strong Chrono for a number of years. How could they be lesser than a werewolf he hadn't even heard off. 

"I… trust you!" Chris said, as he bent down, and leapt up with all his might. The ground beneath crushed under his feet as he suddenly disappeared out of view. Using their noses, they could tell the smell was coming up from above, and looking up Chris was halfway up the pit from a single jump. 

The rest of the werewolves were ready to do the same. They couldn't jump as high as Chris had done, but they could still jump up and climb the sides and as he fell back down, they would strike then. 

Many had their eyes locked on Chris, when through the air, they could see large balls of blood aura. There were hundreds of them, just there in the air.

On the ground, Hikel's markings had lit up and his hands were raised above his head. Seeing the werewolves, he had a big smile before swinging them down. At the same time the large red balls fell from the sky, and it was almost impossible for the werewolves to avoid them due to how many of the red balls there were.

The red aura hit the werewolves but when hitting the skin, it did next to no damage, even though it was a powerful condensed aura. What Hikel was using right now, was the absolute blood control, it was how he was able to control so much blood, and use so much blood aura at the same time. 

What he was using was similar to the 1000 blood swords, yet the condensed energy was made into the shape of swords for a reason, to try and deliver as much damage as possible, yet Hikel had chosen something that suited him more.

With his fingers, he snapped them, and at that moment all of the balls' aura lit up before they exploded at once, all at the same time. A large explosion filled the entire pit and it was shaking just as much as when Unzoku had entered the place. 

There was a reason for Hikel's crude appearance. It wasn't due to the fact that Vincent's experiment had failed, it had very much succeeded, but for it to improve Hikel's strength by leaps and bounds, they needed him to have a power that was a lot stronger than just absolute blood control. 

The absolute blood control did just that, allowing one to control blood aura freely, but Hikel had in mind using his abilities of explosive blood with the absolute blood control. The main issue being that he needed to use his actual blood. Often he would make small cuts on his hand, or rely on weapons that would have part of his blood in it.

This was quite a big issue if he wanted to use both together, which was why there needed to be a change in his body as well and this was the result. The markings were somewhat like permanent wounds on his body. 

When using blood aura, part of his real blood would seep through the markings, mixing in with his blood aura no matter when he used it, allowing him to use his explosive powers at the same time. 

"We… are not the same as we were before!"  Hikel shouted. 

At that moment, breaking through the smoke was the Champion Shinto coming right at him. At the same time, as the smoke cleared up, Chris could be seen with his hand drawn back, right above where Unzoku was.
