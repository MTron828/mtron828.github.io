Chapter 915 - The breakout

From the very back, miles away, looking through his scope, Logan had a good view of everything that was happening. What he was surprised about was, even with the power of his new weapon and the use of blood crystals, that the leader Muka was able to avoid his attacks. Leaders were clearly stronger than he had anticipated.

As he was confident, if the weapon was to be used against a vampire knight, they would struggle to avoid such an attack.

The other problem was, unlike last time, Logan was hoping there would also be those on Quinn’s side. Those that would not join the battle. That way, Borden or Peter would be able to get through, but that didn’t happen at all.

When the sword was lifted, Logan started to imagine a life without Quinn for a brief second. What would be left of all of them after it happened? Would they be lost without a leader, would someone take his place, and would Logan be able to find out the truth of his family? Lastly, he realised how much of a loss Quinn would personally be for him.

However, the blade was stopped, and two of the people Logan had a lot of faith in were seen on stage.

He had no clue how Quinn was able to do it, but Quinn was always full of surprises, just like the towers he had made. What Logan liked, even more, was that both Leo and Paul were wearing the masks he had created for them.

Before, when arriving in the settlement, Logan had attempted to make a call their way, but the signal wouldn’t even get through. He had a suspicion that it was quite possibly due to the Royal guards surrounding the area.

Maybe they had predicted that someone from the outside, or the human world would try to contact them, and had set up a device to block all incoming communications. Still, he knew his masks worked after testing them with Peter’s mask. Which meant only messages sent within the tenth castle were being intercepted.

’A similar device used on as the teleporter blocker perhaps. If I have time to study these, I can find out how they are affecting our equipment.’

Now seeing the two of them there right next to Quinn, they could coordinate everything together. With three, Logan thought this was nearly impossible, but with Paul and Leo they might be able to pull it off.

"Peter, Borden, make sure the leaders don’t reach the stage. Leo, Paul, I’m counting on you both to break Quinn free. If we can get out of this, I think I have a way we can all get back to the human world. Sorry I can’t help any more than that." Logan said, and everyone went straight into action.

On the stage were Bryce, Muka and the two Royal Knights that would always stay by the King’s side. Kyle and Prima. Immediately, Leo went to strike at the cuffs surrounding Alex, who was closest to him. His sword had sliced cleanly through. The cuffs fell to the floor, and Alex was finally free, quickly moving behind Leo.

A material that even Quinn couldn’t break with his natural strength was broken with a strike.

This was out of everyone’s expectations, but they didn’t know Leo was using the power of his second stage Qi. As Leo turned around to free Quinn next, another person had appeared in front of him.

"Your skills are adequate, but skill won’t mean much if I’m faster than you," Prima said smiling, striking Leo across the c.h.e.s.t with his small rapier he had in his hand.

Leo was unable to block the attack, but at the same time, when the blade scr.a.p.ed his skin, it did nothing.

"Does speed really mean much if I can defeat you in one strike!" Leo replied, striking diagonally upward, going across Prima’s c.h.e.s.t. Unlike his attack that had done nothing to Leo, Leo’s strike had revealed a deep cut ripping through his clothes and piercing his skin.

’This is the tenth’s Vampire Knight? Why does he have the strength of a Vampire Leader!’ What was even more worrying was the wound wasn’t healing, and a stinging pain was felt within him, that was soon starting to spread.

"You idiot!" Cindy shouted from below, off the stage. "Remember that the tenth family has been harbouring a blood fairy, and the report from the attack stated that they have weapons made from their blood, don’t get hit! Remove it with your blood control now!"

But it was a little too late for that warning.

On the other side, Quinn had summoned Paul, and Kyle was now in his way, blocking his path. Just like when Paul had fought against Jill, he had wasted no time activating his soul weapon, and floating around in a circle were six green balls of poison.

However, this opponent was not as easy to deal with as Jill. The poison was fast, but if it couldn’t hit his enemy, there wasn’t much Paul could do.

Every time a ball would get close, Kyle was able to use his cape to block the attack, and then immediately, he would change it to a spiral, acting as a large spear, thrusting it forward.

Paul’s poison was purely an offensive ability, so he had to rely on his speed to dodge the attacks. He couldn’t focus on trying to attack with his poison ability at the same time.

’You know what would be good right now, if someone hadn’t taken my damn gloves.’ Paul thought, but he hoped that at least Peter was making good use of them right now.

For he was also surrounded by three strong vampires, one of them being the Vampire Leaders Jin, and Sunny, while the other one was a Vampire Knight, a Wight like himself.

For a second, Peter was slightly confused as he looked at the Wight that wore a hood, covering most of his head, but it still allowed him to see his distinctive facial features.

"Aren’t you meant to be dead? Borden flattened your head last time?" Peter said, vaguely remembering the events when attempting to save Fex.

"That was my brother!" The Wight shouted in anger and was the first one to go in, throwing out his fist. At the same time, Peter did the same. When the two fists had collided though, there was a clear winner as the Wight’s fist shattered within itself. Knowing what he was tough, Peter knew he would heal, so he used the spike gloves and stabbed them into his c.h.e.s.t.

It was too fast for the Wight to react.

’How?’ The Wight thought. ’I saw him fight against my brother last time. I and my brother are equal in strength, and last time he was outmatched. Could it be, his creator really has gotten that much stronger in such a short time?’

Peter was getting ready to use his new weapon to stab right through the Wight’s head, finishing one of them off early, but before that could happen, some blood could be seen flying through the air heading his way.

A few seconds later and the blood exploded, it wasn’t a large explosion, but it served its purpose as Jin just wanted the two of them to be split away. While Peter was startled, Sunny took advantage of the opportunity. She didn’t have an ability that was that helpful in a fight, but she was still a leader who would be able to match Peter’s strength and speed.

However, when she took a step forward, another red shot came out from afar and had stopped her from moving in.

’I have to be careful,’ Sunny thought as she looked at the ground where the red beam had hit. It had caused quite a lot of damage to the floor. She remembered the power from before, how it had nearly knocked the sword out of Muka’s hand with his grip strength.

Although everyone was faring well, at the same time, Quinn was worried, as it didn’t look like they would be able to do much, and there were still leaders and vampire knights that hadn’t joined the fight.

Looking at Borden, two spikes had appeared out of his back, he wasn’t using his full strength, but he was constantly trying to get out of the position he was in so he could at least get to where Quinn was.

’If I use more strength, then it might shorten my time.’ Borden thought. ’But how much time do we have?’

The same thought was also running through Quinn’s mind. Alex was on stage, hiding behind that of Leo. He was worried that if he attempted to fly, they would quickly hit him down out of the sky.

While Quinn was looking to his right at Alex, he didn’t notice that a blood swipe was coming his way directly at him.

’I have to get out of here!’ Quinn thought and started to fill in his energy with the red energy inside his body. Still, he soon noticed that this was a waste of time, as the blood swipe was blocked, and a shadow was cast over Quinn from the person’s back.

"Why did you stop my attack!" Cindy shouted from below. "What do you think you are doing, Bryce?"
