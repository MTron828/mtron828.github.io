Chapter 2504 The second grand meet

Quite a bit of time had passed since Sil had reached the island, and a flood of memories had come back to him while he was there. Thankfully, it looked like none of the Divine beings that had appeared before had arrived where he was.

Still, even with all the time passing, he was worried about something. His MC cells were restoring while he was resting, but there was an odd sensation still felt in his stomach.

It was clear Immortui had done something; the question was just what had he done? Using a healing ability and trying out a few other abilities, Sil tried to rid the feeling that was in his stomach, but none of it was making it go away.

The healing ability was the only thing that had been keeping it slightly at bay. However, it was clear that it was growing in size.

'This thing is spreading inside me. If I remember correctly, he had used the colorless ability,' Sil thought. 'But the Champions, they weren't aware that he can use it out of his body as well, and he might be able to use it in more ways than one.

'I don't know what's going to happen to me; it might spread across my entire body, but I have to tell Quinn no matter what about what he can do.'

With his MC cells recovered and time running short, it was time for him to teleport out of the situation he was in.

'I hope I never have to return to an island like this again.'

Teleporting away, Sil had no real direction as to where he needed to go. When he had teleported Immortui as far away as he could, he was just doing so frantically, not sure about where to end up.

So he just started as he headed off to the closest part where there was noise, and immediately he had fallen into a war zone taking place on a plane.

There were the Chrono inhabitants having grabbed weapons that they had made, mainly axes and swords. They were strong and powerful, as they fought against the divine beings, but it seemed useless.

A pattern was emerging that was tiring out the inhabitants, the fact that the godly beings were able to heal their allies.

'I can't help them; that isn't something I can do right now,' Sil said to himself.

Just as he was ready to teleport away again, after confirming there being no presence of Quinn or the others, he saw a spear stab a Chrono right through the chest. Blood splattered out and flew through the air.

When looking at the blood itself, Sil noticed something strange. It wasn't falling quickly toward the ground; it was floating slightly and eventually hit the floor. It was perhaps unnoticeable, especially to those that were fighting for their lives, but because it had happened right in front of him, he noticed the bizarre action.

When taking a closer look at the blood, that's when he noticed that it was also moving on the ground as well. It wasn't moving very fast, but it looked as if it was crawling in a specific direction.

For a moment, Sil thought he was going mad, but he could see it happening all around him, with all the other fallen blood as well.

'It couldn't be, could it?'

Teleporting away, Sil had arrived on another planet. It was pretty much in the same state as the last, with blood being spilled all over the place. Only this time, the blood that was on the ground was lifting slightly upward, moving to a certain location.

Teleporting, Sil hoped to another planet. Now the blood wouldn't drop to the floor; instead, it was in the air heading in one direction. It was clear there was a pattern going on here.

Continuing to go from planet to planet, following the blood, Sil had eventually found himself landing on the planet of the giants. He was able to return. Instead of heading to the cave or looking through the fight that was going on, he continued to follow the blood.

The planet was large, so instead of running, Sil had teleported one more time, and he had landed right where he wanted. He could see Quinn standing on his own, his eyes were closed.

Blood was flowing all around him, from out of the space in the sky. As it came close to him, it was turning into small red particles, somewhat similar to the blood aura he would use. It then swirled around his body, entering through the pores of his skin, giving him a thick glowing layer over his body.

Having sensed something coming in front of him, he opened his eyes. "Sil!" Quinn said.

"Stop!" Sil shouted. "I can see you're doing something important, so carry on and focus; don't break your attention, and I will be the one that does the talking."

Little did Sil know that Quinn was doing this all in the first place to help Sil, but now that he was in this strange state, this absorption method, he didn't want to let go of it. The power he was gaining was similar to that when he had evolved into the blood celestial. He had never felt so in tune with his blood powers before.

"Not too long ago, I had a battle with Immortui. As you can see, I am very much alive," Sil explained. "Through my battle, I did everything I could to hold him back while waiting for you to wake up, and it looks like I succeeded.

"But, Quinn, Immortui is extremely strong, which is why I want to inform you of his powers."

"The Champions already told me what Immortui is capable of," Quinn said, still focusing on the power around him and closing his eyes.

"That's good to hear; it means I can keep this short then," Sil replied. "His colorless power, he is able to use it outside of his body, or he is at least able to detach it from himself. Think of it as another energy he can control, and the two snakes over his shoulder, they contain power just as strong as the red mist he can control.

"I wish I could help you more; I wish I could have fought by your side... but it looks like you will have to do this on your own. I will stay safe."

Before Quinn could say anything else, Sil had teleported away. He didn't want him to worry, especially when he himself didn't know what was wrong with him.

'Sil, it's good to see you're alive, but the fact that you were unable to beat him just goes to show how strong he is as well,' Quinn thought.

As if to interrupt him in the middle of his thoughts, falling right from the sky and touching the ground ever so softly, not even harming a single dust mark on the floor, Immortui had floated down, covered in a red mist aura that surrounded the area. It swirled around him, just like the blood was swilirng around Quinn.

"I thought all of this might be your doing! I'm surprised to see you like this?" Immortui said.
