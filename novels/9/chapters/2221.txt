Majestic Desert Splendor

Listening to Logan and listening to Stark, they had gathered what was going on right now. After the Dalki were done with everyone on this planet, they were now moving on to the next, and most likely, they wouldn't be going to just any of the two planets, but going to the one where Wince and the Blades had gone to.

Immediately, Ceril started to walk out the door with a determined look on her face.

"What are you doing?" Russ asked, standing in her way.

"What do you think?" Ceril replied. "I have to go save my sister. If we waste any more time here, she could be killed at any second."

"Wait, wait." Jake also decided to join in the conversation. "Are you saying you want to try and follow the enemy after we just did everything to get away from them? Remember, the number one goal in all of this was getting Sil.

"We have him. Right now, he won't wake up, but he eventually will. You have to think of this carefully; we're on a planet where the attackers have already left. It's actually the ideal place to leave Sil right now.

"If we leave with him, we'll just be taking him to them."

Although they understood Ceril's complaint, they actually agreed with Jake. "He's right. Even us just appearing on the battlefield right now, it's possible it will also bring H to the battlefield.

"If that happens, the Alliance won't just have to deal with the Dalki, Pine, and the rest, but probably H as well. Just making things worse."

There was always the chance to hide Sil in Minny's shadow, but the real question was more about them joining this war.

"I have a suggestion," Stark said. "I've already used the power of the armor, and if I use it again, it would affect me seriously. Unlike the rest of you, I'm not so strong. My speed, the power of my attacks wouldn't be much help against these guys.

"There are two ships; I can stay with Sil until he wakes up, and as soon as he does, come to where you guys are. He can no longer use the machine, and this way, they will be confused as to where Sil is."

It was a good suggestion that almost satisfied everything, but it still didn't solve one problem.

"Are we strong enough?" Vicky asked. It was almost as if she was reading the minds of everyone in the room.

"Well, I don't know about you weaklings, but I can certainly hold my own," Russ commented. "I'm not planning to die in some crappy war."

It was the truth; if there was no need for Russ to take part, then he wouldn't go and would just stay here with Stark, but if Layla and Minny went, it would mean that Russ would have to go as well.

Ceril knew that the strongest forces in their group at the moment were Layla and Russ, and perhaps Jake if he agreed to fight as well.

"Layla, are you really going to abandon everyone just like that?" Ceril asked. "I understand you say that family is important to you. I really do understand, after all, we are talking about my sister right now.

"But it's not just my sister; it's the Penswi, the Mermerials, and the Amra, the rest of them that are all fighting for their families and for the sake of you being safe. With everyone here, we have a chance of saving them all, but without us... my sister and the rest aren't strong enough to stop them."

Ceril fell to her knees in front of Layla, pleading, "Which is why, I'm begging you, please. Let's join this fight and take them down."

As they looked around, everyone seemed to understand that the decision was ultimately up to Layla.

"I... I..."

------

On the very planet in question, their worst fears had come true. The Blades, as well as Wince, had safely landed on the planet. It was in a worse state than theirs had been before Pine and the others attacked.

The territory of the city where the battle was taking place was currently controlled equally by each group, half and half. This was not good for the alliance, which had more people and was only defending.

Upon landing, Wince made a quick decision, "We have to fight. We have to help them lower the numbers as quickly as possible before they arrive!" Wince ordered.

Rather than holding back, she and the rest of the Blades joined the fight. With her trident and her skills, she thrust her weapon forward, hitting a large whirlpool of power right in the Dalki's stomach.

Quickly jumping up in the air, she landed in front of a group of humans and slammed the trident on the ground, creating a large wave of water that swirled and severed the limbs of several humans.

"Are you sure this is the right thing to do?" one of the Blades named Hide asked. He was mainly taking charge of the group while Shiro was away. "I mean, if we fight all out like this, sure it's helping our allies, but we will tire out, and then when they come..."

"This is exactly why we need to fight now, before they come!" Wince shouted back, as she started to spin her trident in a circle. As she did, water followed her trident and floated in the air, the amount of water growing as she continued.

"If they are here, continuing the war would be useless. We have to take out as many as we can and just focus on them. That way, even if we lose the fight, we at least took out as many of these guys as possible before we die."

Hide was surprised, but he could tell from her words and resolve that she had made a decision. She was okay with dying; in fact, she believed there was a high chance she would die today, so she would do so with a bang.

Thrusting her trident forward, the water she had been twirling around in the air went out, and like a laser, the water hit multiple targets in the area, injuring humans, Dalki, and more.

The fighting continued, and Wince didn't realise it, but they had more time than they thought. This was because, although Pine was able to deal with the other planet rather quickly, a ship needed to be sent out from the Marpo Cruise, and in doing so, it would then have to take them to one of the two planets.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

At the same time, they had no idea what was going on in the Marpo Cruise. The chaos and the more pressing matters took precedence over sending a ship out, but a ship was eventually sent.

After Wince and the Blades' push, they managed to take out a quarter of the remaining force and pushed back, gaining more territory. But they were getting tired, and backup seemed to have arrived.

Jumping out of a medium-sized ship, Wince could see them. Pine and the rest of the Dalki landed on the battlefield. They were at the central square, the main marketplace the Amra used in the city.

"Everyone, stop!" Wince shouted. "Fall back."

She knew the rest of them were no match for what was to come. She wanted to tell them all to run, but to where? There was no way for them to escape on the planet, so instead, she decided to take a step forward.

When she did, Hide followed, as did the rest of the fifty or so Blades. All of them, bearing injuries, began to move, forming two rows behind Wince, who stood there with the trident held in her hand.

"A smart choice," Pine said. "You knew you had nowhere to run, so you decided to fight. You are brave, and honestly, as a Dalki, I like that."

"If we are unable to beat you, then it means those behind me will no longer be able to see their families. That's why I will win this fight!" Wince declared as a blue aura started to cover her entire body, mixed in with a bright white energy--the energy of a Celestial.

She still had the power that Quinn had given her, and she hoped it would be of use to her in this fight. A fight for her and everyone else's life.
