Chapter 2515 ¬†Quinn's eternal struggle

Each time Quinn's blood aura struck against Immortui's red mist energy, the entire sky would be painted in a thick veil of red. The ground would shake, and a shockwave of power would end up spreading through all of the land in sight.

Continuous clashes of their powers were hitting each other, and the attacks weren't slowing down; they were just getting faster and faster, destroying more of the energy around them.

That was until Immortui decided to change up his strategy with his attacks. He raised his hand, and a colourless ball started to form around it.

Almost immediately, a shadow portal had opened behind him, and coming straight out of it was Quinn with six arms by his side, having activated the Asura gauntlets' active skill, although it looked slightly different compared to before.

Two of the arms were completely covered in condensed shadow, giving them a dark purple colour. Landing in front of Immortui, two of Quinn's regular hands grabbed his wrists, meanwhile, his normal hands gathered with the vampire aura and covered in the blood shadow, proceeded to punch Immortui in the stomach one after the other.

The blows lifted Immortui off the ground, but the other hands held him down, making sure he wouldn't fly away. Punch after punch was delivered with aura seeping out through his body behind.

'I have to strike him before he can use his colourless ability,' Quinn thought. 'I have to utilise the shadow with the rest of the skills I learned. The training and information from the champions, and what Sil told me.'

The two serpents above Immortui's shoulders started to open their mouths, gathering the red energy; both of them were pointed at Quinn. As the beam attack left their jaws, Quinn immediately used the shadow-covered Asura hands to block the attack.

The beam was shifting the arms, but the power wasn't getting through. "You can thank Sil for letting me know about them. Did you really think after our last fight, I would have learned nothing?"

Lifting up his leg, Immortui struck Quinn right on his side, crashing into him, grunting through the pain and with the armour taking most of the hits, Quinn continued to throw out his punches. Thanks to the blood shadow, they were having double the effect as well.

"You are quite naive!" Immortui said, as he went for another kick, but this time on the edge of his foot, he had a ball of colourless energy.

Immediately, Quinn used the shadow travel, sinking into the ground and letting go. The foot missed, going right over where Quinn was, and the colourless ball of energy had left his foot. It continued to travel through the air until it exploded, making a large area colourless for a few moments before disappearing.

With the shadow travel, Quinn had distanced himself from Immortui. 'Sil was right; he can use the colourless ability out of his body. But it looks like if he wants to spread out its power, he can still only do so from his hands. The balls of energy, although having the same effect, disappear after a while.'

A red mist portal appeared above Quinn's head, and immediately, a giant fist of power came down attempting to crush Quinn. He moved out of the way, running to the side, but several giant fists continued to follow him, crushing the ground beneath where he once was.

While running, Quinn didn't stop his attacks; he continued to throw out the Asura hands, throwing out all types of different blood fists to hit him. They were crashing into Immortui's body, distracting him from using his power but didn't appear to do any significant damage.

'This is okay; I can just injure him a bit at a time. I don't need to rush things. With the limitless effect of the armour, I can keep on going. It doesn't matter if it takes 1 hour or 100 days! I will continue to chip at him until he's completely defeated!'

Tapping his boots, two clones of Quinn were made with a cloud of smoke. They went to two different sides and continued to throw out the blood fists. They didn't have six arms like that of Quinn, but still, with more attacks all heading the same way, Immortui was getting bombarded with attacks left, right, and center.

Seeing this, Immortui was getting fed up. He placed both of his arms close to his chest; they were shaking with power as the mist condensed, then opening it up, he threw his arms out, and a ring of energy went out from his body, filling the entire area, just like the shockwaves from before.

Each of the Quinns had disappeared in that moment, though, and when the aura passed, all three had popped out of the shadow.

'The timing, the strength, I will use everything I have to get rid of him. I can't lose again; I can't this time. I have to focus; I can't make a mistake!'

Quinn ran across at great speed ahead; he could see the serpent was wrapping around Immortui's hand.

Leaping up in the air, all of the clones leaped up in the air. Their legs were condensed with the blood energy that was still swirling around the entire area. Then spinning their bodies and using the air steps, they pushed forward, and a large kick landed on different sections of Immortui's body.

One landing on the head, the stomach, and the bottom of his legs. The attack was as powerful as the one that Quinn had used to get rid of the Divine Beings, but Immortui just stood there in place, with his strange armour having covered his entire body from his legs.

"You are a real fool; I had more trouble dealing with your friend from before. The only thing you are useful for is your power!" Immortui stated.

Immortui threw out his fist, and Quinn was expecting the serpent strike that Immortui could produce, one of the most powerful attacks he had.

This was the most important thing Quinn had to look out for. Rushing to the side, he believed he had avoided it, but it wasn't the same attack.

Out from Immortui's hand a large red fist, like it was his own, had come out, and it extended, stretching as if it had a physical form. It latched onto Quinn's entire body and lifted him in the air, slamming him on the ground.

Then the red mist portals opened up above Quinn, not just one, but four of them. Out from above him, several large red fists continued to pound the area where Quinn was on the ground one after the other. It hit him again and again, pounding him in one place.

The armour was taking the brunt of the attacks, but it was hurting Quinn as he was being suffocated from the punches, until the shadow condensed above him, and it started to push up against the fists. It wasn't just the shadow, but the blood energy started to form a barrier and was pushing up against the fists.

The fists continued to hit, but they were being blocked by the shadow, as Quinn got to his feet. Pressing the side of his mask, it opened up a little at the front, and he spat out his blood on the ground. Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

"Come on, is that all you got! Were you going to take out the Celestials with that!" Quinn shouted.
