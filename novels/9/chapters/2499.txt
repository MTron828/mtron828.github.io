Chapter 2500 Feeling blood

After seeing Quinn head off to do whatever it was he was about to do, the group realised that the task for them hadn't changed much. The main goal was to get the demon king's blood.

"At the moment, there are only three more of the demon kings' blood that we need right?" Hikel asked.

"Yes." Pultra answered. "The Yak demon king's blood, Tenbris, the demon king of the skies, and finally Unzoku, the demon king of the Werewolves."

"Not just get their blood, but we also need to get rid of the demon kings." Calva said. "We know Quinn is strong, and he has the strength to get rid of Immortui, but if their fight is a close one, then just one of the demon kings could turn the tide. We need to get rid of them if we can as well."

"Then you're saying there's a good chance that there are four demon kings out there, and Chris and Edvard are fighting against them, themselves?" Russ stated.

They had seen Unzoku arriving on one of the large battleships. They had seen Tenbris flying through the sky with his flock of demons even now battling against the Divine Brigade.

They had, for certain, seen Luce and Bisha. The task was a tall one, and in some ways they thought if Quinn was by their side he would help them take them out, but the situation wasn't as clear as it was meant to be.

"Well, we can't just sit here and talk about it." Peter exclaimed. "We have to go and bring them back. Focus on the blood, and kill them if we have the chance, it's that simple."

Peter stood at the edge of the cave and then leapt out descending down the mountain. In turn the rest had decided to follow. The group were running fast through the forest, and almost instantly, had managed to catch the attention of the Divine beings that were flying above.

Instantly they started to defend, as the Divine beings fired away, destroying the ageing trees from above. Hikel, swung his arm and blood aura swipe exploded in the sky covering them as much as possible.

Several of the golden beings started to fire towards the front, aiming to block their path. For Russ, with transforming his legs into that of the Penswi race, he rushed in front of the shots and held out his hand with his god slayer item.

He absorbed the blow of each of them blocking all of the hits. Which allowed Peter, Calva, and Shinto to do the rest, they had leapt forward and using their powers, cut, punched and stabbed right through the Divine beings, not slowing down and continuing on ahead.

"I was surprised that you would block those attacks for us, have you started to take a liking to us?" Hikel asked.

"In your dreams." Russ retorted. "If we run into those demon kings again, I don't want to die, and this is the perfect opportunity to get my MC cells up as high as possible. Just leave stopping their attacks to me."

"I have a feeling that Chris will be going after Unzoku!" Hikel claimed. "Based on the way he acted before. At the same time, it's one of the demon king's blood that we haven't obtained. Let's head in that direction first!"

The others were in agreement, but as they continued forward, several white lines shooting through the air was seen. Immediately upon seeing this, Russ pulled out the black sword, and swung, hitting one and stopping the rest of the attack.

He placed the sword away, and switched to gathering the power of the shadow around his arms, but he soon realised that it was a distraction, because right in front of them, there was suddenly a large white wall that had risen blocking their path. It was even taller than the top of the trees and had ascended in a second.

The group stopped, and an image could be seen forming out of the wall. Like a man walking out of water, Luce had appeared breaking through.

"Did you think that I would let you, who took my arm away, get away just like that. Even with everything going on, I can tell that you guys are the danger, and I need to get rid of you." Luce said. "And it looks like I've managed to catch a few extras. Who would have thought, in a situation like this, the Champions would have turned against us."

"Go!" Hikel shouted, his fingers behind his back, moving his hand and gesturing to the champions to go away. "We have business with this one, and we can handle him ourselves, you need to help the others!"

Using the shadow travel, Quinn realised that he could move through the area with relatively little trouble. He wouldn't attract the attention of the Divine beings doing this.

Which allowed him to reach the area he had trained in before. The barren wasteland with darkened, almost black, ground beneath him. The good thing was, the Divine Brigade looked to have stopped coming through the portals and they were starting to close up.

They had moved from the area and were fighting against the demon kings and the demons that had recently arrived on the planet. The area where Quinn was, it was void of people which was perfect for him.

Exiting out of the shadow space he stood there. He then closed his eyes.

'I have to think, think back to the sensation that I felt when I became a celestial. At the time of the evolution I could feel it, all of the blood on the other planets, all of the fighting that was going on.

'With the demon blood, I can feel the blood a lot more accurately, but If I can ultimately do that again.'

First Quinn was trying to focus on the sounds that he could hear, and then all of the energy of the blood. He was the ruler of blood, this was where his power strived from, and right now he was planning to use it, gathering it in one place to give a beacon for Immortui.

'I know Sil, you did everything you could to protect me. You probably tried to buy as much time as possible, tried to keep him away from me, and now me calling him back, might just feel like a kick in the mouth.

'But, just like you care about me, I care about you as well. I can't have another person die, I'm going to do whatever it is I can!'

Rather than reaching out for the blood that was being shed on the current planet Quinn was on, he was reaching out beyond, to all the blood being spilt and the energy from it was starting to move, all throughout the universe, it was heading towards Quinn.
