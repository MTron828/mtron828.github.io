Chapter 2245 ¬†The war over?

On one of the many Amra planets where the fighting was taking place, it had almost completely stopped on one planet. Intense battles between the two forces' very best were going on.

At first, the humans and Dalki were both very confident in their victory. They had already pushed the enemy so far back that they only had to get through the market square and then to the enemy's camp that had been set up to finish them off.

However, help had arrived at the last moment, but even with the help, they knew they had Pine and his team of Five Spike Dalki on their side. Still, they thought victory was in their sights until the Five Spike Dalki started to lose one by one.

Each battle against the Five Spikes had been tough so far. Minny and Galen, with both of their hard work, had finished the Five Spike off. The two of them had come out of the fight mostly unhurt and wished to help the others. By the time their fight was over, though, Layla was on the floor lying in one of the partly broken houses.

In order to protect her and make sure she didn't get hurt, she went with Galen in her shadow to stay by her side while the fight between Russ in his Black Swordsman form and Pine had continued.

Logan and Vicky had managed to defeat the Five Spike, but in doing so, Logan was on his last breath. He was close to death until the humans from the enemy side had intervened. Conflicted on who they were fighting for and why Logan would fight for the other side, they had decided to help him.

Currently, they were on the rooftop of one of the buildings near the square. Those with healing abilities were doing what they could to make sure Logan would make it out there alive, while Vicky was meditating, trying to get her energy back. Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

Thankfully, due to the tense fight and power that was coming from the battle between Pine, Layla, and Russ, nearly no one was paying them any attention or attempting to go after their lives.

Still, there were intense battles with the other Five Spikes going all over the place. One of them was Jake. He had no trouble going up against the Five Spike. He had yet to be seriously injured, and his combination of mixing powers to create new ones made him versatile and able to do things that the Five Spike couldn't imagine.

The only thing he was having trouble with was the fact that the Dalki he was facing just wasn't dying. In the end, though, stabbing the Dalki with metal spikes through its body, freezing its legs in place, Jake was also able to melt the Dalki's head, killing it completely. He was able to make a molten, lava-like substance by combining his earth ability with a bit of his hardening ability and then melting it down with his flames.

This was something the Dalki was unable to deal with. Just like Vicky, though, Jake had expended a lot of MC cells and moved slightly back to heal a bit. He wished to help the others, but the thing was, they didn't need any help.

The two sisters alone were able to deal with the Dalki they were facing as well. The versatile water blood that Ceril could use allowed them to attack from all sorts of different angles.

Meanwhile, Wince was able to do most of the damage with her Celestial strength, her demon-tier spear, and her water powers. A combination of the two, attacking the right point, made them an incredibly strong duo.

It looked like they would have been able to deal with their Five Spike a bit earlier compared to the others. The only problem was Wince had injuries from before.

Finally, there was the group of Blades. They had already lost a number of their group before Shiro had arrived, and unfortunately, even with Shiro there, they found the Five Spike Dalki difficult to deal with.

Shiro, switching between Vorden and Raten, had done a lot of work against the Five Spike, but they still managed to lose a couple more Blades to the Five Spike before managing to defeat it.

It was almost as if the Dalki knew it was going to lose its life and did its best to take a couple down with them.

With that, all of the Five Spike Dalki that had arrived in the attack had been defeated, and then there was only Pine left. The thing was, the Dalki and the humans watching never expected him to be defeated.

Even while watching the fight, nearly throughout the whole thing, he had the upper hand, but now his head was on the floor, and his body was there as well. Strangely, though, the body started to turn into particles of dust.

'What is this?' Russ thought.

No one dared approach Russ. They had no idea that he was completely spent of his MC cells. In their head, he was just the one that had finished off a single being that could take out their whole army, so they didn't want to approach him for fear that he would do the same.

After the particles of dust started to disappear, a crystal was left in its place. Russ bent over and picked it up. It was long and quite thick as well.

'I've never seen anything like that, and this was inside his body?' Russ thought. 'It doesn't feel the same as those Nest Crystals, but I wonder if I would be able to absorb it just like the Nest Crystal. If it's even able to give me a fraction of Pine's power, it would be worth it.'

Activating one of his storage rings, the crystal was placed inside. He would keep it for himself. After all, he had earned it.

On top of the rooftop, the colour could be seen returning to Logan's face. He was now breathing in deeper than before. It looked like they had managed to reach him in time.

"It's a good thing we brought some engineers with us to have a look as well," one of them said.

"Yeah, some of the backup circuits were used to help his body function in a certain way. Honestly, it's because of that, he managed to stay alive as well."

Finally, Logan opened his eyes. He could remember what had happened, but the first thing he did was turn his head, and he could see Vicky sitting there meditating. She was ignoring everything around her and didn't even realise that the one she had been worried about this entire time was awake.

'I can see her clothes are wet. She must have been crying quite a bit,' Logan thought.

Perhaps this was a chance for them to split ways from each other and end the battle there.

A sound had soon entered Logan's ears, and everyone else's though. Looking up, they could see a What was going to happen now, though? Was the war over on these planets? It was clear that many of the humans and even the Dalki no longer had a desire to fight. None of them had jumped in after the death of Pine, nor had continued their fighting.

Perhaps this was a chance for them to split ways from each other and end the battle there.

A sound had soon entered Logan's ears, and everyone else's though. Looking up, they could see a spaceship flying by. It soon hovered just over the market square.

Not getting a good feeling of what was about to come, Russ, who was below, decided to move and headed back to where Layla and Minny currently were.

The ship never landed, but the hatch had opened, and falling down from the ship were three figures. When hitting the ground, they had done so in a heavy way due to the planet's gravity, and a cloud of dust spread out by their feet.

All three of them, based on their shape and size, were clearly Dalki, but when taking a closer look at them, one could see that they were different from the others. For one, two of the Dalki had six spikes running from the top of their back down, getting smaller as they went closer to the tail. Then there was the one in the centre.

"It's H‚Ä¶ he's finally here," Logan said, looking from above.

"I believe you know why I'm here. Now, where is he?" H asked.

No one had given an answer, and in that moment, one person had decided to act. Was it through fear, trying to get the upper hand, or just desperation to do whatever they could to take this monster down?

Wince stood on her feet. She started to run forward, blue aura surrounded her, mixing in with the celestial energy. More water started to gather around her trident. She was putting every little ounce of strength she had into this attack and hurled it, throwing it over her shoulder.

Her strength, the power, all pushed the spear forward, creating a wave and stream of water that would have been able to cut diamonds, it had so much pressure behind it.

The spear was aimed right towards H, who simply raised his hand. He stepped to the side and grabbed it. When he did, he spun his body and hurled it back. Several loud bangs were heard as the trident was breaking through sound and air barriers.

The trident had moved too fast, the attack was too fast, and now, Wince, looking down at her stomach, there was a large hole. Nearly her entire midsection was missing. She didn't even have time to say her last words as she fell to the floor, followed by the screams of her sister.
