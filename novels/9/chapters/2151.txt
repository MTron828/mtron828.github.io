Inside the arena, the Penswi people were in a panic. They had no clue what was going on in the viewing room, or what was taking place. All they could see was that in one moment there were these swords made out of a strange power that started to form, and then the next second they started to drop down.

It almost looked as if they were raining down, but they soon stopped right in front of them, just an inch away from their faces. As one person attempted to move, the sword followed them, and moved slightly closer, when they stayed still for a while, the sword eventually moved back.

It was clearly telling them not to move from their position, so all of the Penswi remained still, as they talked to those by their side.

"What is this, are we under attack!"

"Don't move, maybe it's not best to speak, it's as if these swords are following us!"

"But, if they wanted to kill us, whatever this is, wouldn't the sword have attacked us by now."

"Then the answer is obvious, whoever is behind this attack, they don't want us to move, and they aren't trying to kill us, which means, we're being used as hostages right now."

The Penswi had come to this conclusion, and in order not to panic those that weren't in the arena, the broadcast had quickly been cut off, but there was still this uneasy feeling, because just moments ago, moments before the swords were in the air, all of them felt this great energy that shook their bodies.

Inside the viewing room, it had become quite clear to the King and Queen as well, at any moment this person could kill all of those in the arena. The two of them gulped and were too afraid to even speak.

"Quinn!" Jun shouted. "What are you doing, how could you do this, after we respected you. We never did anything to harm you so why are you doing this!"

While everyone else was frightened, Jun was the one that was strong enough to speak. Although he was a trickster and knew to some extent the strength of Quinn, in all the time he spent with him, he never felt like he was a bad person. So why was he doing this, seeing this sight, his own race being hurt, it made him feel betrayed.

"That's just how desperate the situation is!" Quinn shouted. "Do you think anything I said before, do you think I want any of that to be true? I have a family as well that I want to protect, and this is the best option for us all.

"I know it's hard to convince you, which is why I needed to show you all. Actions speak a lot louder than words especially in this situation. Right now, what I have shown you is a part of my power. With my strength I could quite confidently say I could kill every single being on this planet. Despite the power I have, I would still lose against the enemy."

His words were sincere, a lot of those in the room could tell by the tone of his voice, and at that moment, as quick as the blood swords appeared, he made them disappear. It was never his intention to use the others as hostages.

"What he says is true." Russ added, thinking it was the right time to speak. "The reason is complicated as to why we have decided to go against your own, but the facts are the facts. They will come, and all of you will die."

After being threatened with such power, the words of death were fresh in their mind and extremely powerful.

"My King, My Queen." An unexpected voice had joined in the conversation, and the one that walked forward was none other than the Penswi hero Stark. "These beings, they didn't attack us from the beginning. Even though they have this power, not once did they use it.

"We just saw what he could do, and if he was to use that power in the event, he could have easily won the whole thing. The fact was he didn't. Quinn had competed in the events in our way using speed. I believe he had done so as a sign of respect. For him to do this much to go this far‚Ä¶ I say I believe him, and we should listen to what he has to say."

The Queen and King both looked at each other still with concerned looks on their faces, but as the leaders of an entire race, they had to say and do something in this situation and not just be frightened by everything that was happening and that they were hearing.

"Stark is able to see clearer than we were." The King replied. "The best thing to do is believe you, it would be the best option for us regardless, but I still have an issue. You say, these attackers are even stronger than you, if that's the case, what can we even do to help you, what use are we?"

"The enemy, they have an army of strong forces. They are large in number and great in strength but you won't be fighting on your own. As I said before, they are not only coming for your race, and your planet, but others as well.

"Across planets, I plan to form an alliance of races that are to go against them. You won't be fighting on your own. On top of that, the enemy has holes and targets that we can strike‚Ä¶"F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Quinn stopped there because he didn't want to say anything anymore. To be honest, in his head he had formed a plan of sorts, the best thing to do. To gather an alliance that would fight against the invasions from Jim and Jack.

While that was taking place, he would do his best to free Sil. This was the hole he was talking about, but when put like this, the other races that would be risking their lives, they were simply a distraction.

Usually Quinn would never do something like this, but it was the best way. If they didn't stop Jim and Jack, then all of the races would be annihilated.

"Stark, I asked you to come here, because I think you would be a great help as well. I want you to travel with me and be our point of contact with the Penswi. I know Stark is greatly respected, so I believe he can help convince your people."

In a lot of ways, Stark had more influence than the King and Queen. If they brought up such things, the matter would feel more politically motivated.

"Of course, I won't force you to come, but if you did, then I would help you grow. In particular, your speed is impressive and if you came with me, I could make you even faster‚Ä¶ the fastest being that can't be touched." Quinn said.

Stark blinked a few times‚Ä¶

"Is what you're saying true?"
