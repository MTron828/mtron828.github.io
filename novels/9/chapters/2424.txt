In the vampire settlement itself, time had continued to pass with not much of anything happening. Things did happen on a day to day basis, but nothing extreme compared to what the settlement had been through before. 

No one wanted to say it, they were afraid if they did they might end up jinxing themselves, but it was currently a peaceful period in their lives. This was also true for the students as well. 

It was currently lunch time for the vampire students, many were outside playing, practising, studying, or hitting the human bodied dolls as they practised their techniques. 

For Minny and her two best friends, Abby and Tobi, they too were practising their moves on the human body dolls. 

Tobi swung both of his hands, and two blood swipes were seen in the air. The first strike hit the doll perfectly on its chest creating a red x, and then the other successfully hit the head. 

After a few moments, the markings on the dolls disappeared. 

"Did you see that, Minny! How cool am I?" Tobi puffed out his chest, with his thumb pointed towards himself.  F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

"That might be something impressive compared to most vampires your age, but you have to remember that you're showing off in front of Minny, who can do a lot more than that." Abby commented, as she threw out a strike of her own. 

Rather than the normal blood swipe, she had let out a single line of blood aura, that cut at the neck perfectly on the doll. Her strikes weren't as powerful as Tobi's but they certainly were more controlled. 

What Abby had said was true as well. For their age, the vampire kids were just learning how to summon their blood aura. Only a few could produce swipes, and now Tobi was able to summon a swipe at will and also control it. 

This was true for Abby, but she had more blood control. The two of them were practically geniuses. It was hard for them to think or feel that way, because if they were geniuses, then what did that make Minny.

"The two of you are doing great!" Minny gave them both two thumbs up, with a big smile on her face. It only lasted a few seconds before it faded away. 

Both Abby and Tobi looked at each other, it wasn't the first time Minny had felt this way. She was in pain, saddened but was trying to hide it, and hadn't done a very good job. Even the teachers had recognised that she wasn't doing her best compared to her usual self. 

It was why they had even built these three training dummies especially for her. Usually on the playground there was only one area with the training dummies. It was an area that would be dominated by the older students.

With Minny being the star of the school, and with who her parents were, they had made a special location in the playground for her to also train. Not a single student complained about this, at least not openly anyway.

"Hey Minny, what's with the arse face?" Tobi asked. "When you're sad, it makes your face look all wrinkly, like my grandpa's nut sa-"

A deep kick on the shin was felt coming from Abby, she had done so before Tobi could finish his sentence. 

"What are you trying to do, and what were you just going to say in front of Minny!" Abby asked, all red faced. 

Rubbing his shin, Tobi was complaining to himself.

"What, I'm only doing what Jeff told me." Tobi mumbled. 

A few days ago, Tobi had decided to go to the senior vampires for a little bit of advice. He had realised his own feelings, his deep feelings for Minny, but why would a girl of her status ever be with him. Especially with the history they had. 

At the same time, with what had happened, some might think he was crazy, or had a bone breaking fetish for liking the vampire that had once assaulted him. Still, he had asked for advice and the one given made sense, at least in his head. 

"You have to tease the girl, play it cool." Jeff said. "If she knows that you like her, then how do you think she's going to act?" 

"Act… um, she will act nice to me?" Tobi replied. 

"No, she'll think you're weird, and get attacked, but if you act cool, act like you don't care, then she will want you. She'll think he is someone that I can't get. Girls want a guy that they can't get, that way it feels like a type of prize for them." 

The words of his senior sounded extremely confusing to Tobi, and honestly it didn't make a lot of sense, but he was just a kid, so he trusted the adult to guide him. Which was why he had been teasing Minny for quite a while. 

To the point where he had received quite a few bruises and a broken bone or two, which all healed of course, but if this continued on, then people might really think he had some type of fetish.

Minny looked at her two friends, and she was too tired to even get angry at Tobi anymore. Because actually she had just been missing her dad a lot. She wanted to talk about it, explain to the others, but the other vampires weren't meant to know what he was doing. 

According to them, he was just away on business relations with other groups. Since Peter was no longer pretending to be him, this was the excuse they had to come up with. Minny opened up her mouth but just ended up with a defeated sigh.

Trying to change the topic, Abby walked over and stood by her side. 

"Hey, how's your little brother doing, is he enjoying his new home?" Abby asked. 

Due to everything that was going on, and the fame that the Talen family had reached, in the end Minny, Layla, and Galen had to move out of their small house and into one of the castles. 

They had lived there for a while after events and people were reluctant to come when Quinn was there, but now that he was gone, it seemed like the Talen family were getting their fair share of stalkers. 

"My brother… he keeps sneaking out." Minny answered. "At first he was just hiding all over the castle, but now he's been sneaking even out of the castle, mother gets really worried sometimes because of it."

There was a little more to it than Minny was letting on. Her mother was getting extremely frustrated because her brother was using his shadow powers to escape from the castle. 

It was impossible to contain him as he used his powers to escape and explore. It was almost as if he had reached his teenage years before he was even a teenager. 

"I mean he's your brother so he should be alright in the vampire settlement right?" Tobi said. 

"Don't be stupid!" Abby shouted. "He's a toddler. He can't even speak properly, of course his mum is worried sick, right?" 

Thinking about it, did they really need to worry about her brother? Galen had the shadow powers and in some cases, Minny thought he might soon be even stronger than her. She just hoped in the future, he wouldn't cause too much trouble.
