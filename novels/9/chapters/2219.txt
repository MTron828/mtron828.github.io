Stark and Sil were inside the ship flying through space. He was originally a little worried about being blasted or shot at while trying to escape. The black pods were used as they had more success landing on the planets than the ships.

However, for some reason they were safe as they went toward the planet. This was all because Logan was causing chaos inside with the androids. They didn't even have time to focus on the ship and had no idea who was on board.

If they did, if Jack knew, then certainly they would have put all of their fire power towards destroying the ship.

Heading back, they were heading to one of the three frontal planets that had been attacked, and the planet of choice was where Wince currently was at. This is what they had agreed.

They needed help, and with the power of Sil they would be able to defeat whatever enemies came their way, hopefully with the humans on their side. Yet, it didn't work out like that.

As he came closer to the planet, Stark noticed something extremely strange.

'The city, it's not the same as it was before‚Ä¶ Why does it look like no fighting is going on?' Stark thought.

Explosions, abilities, powers, and buildings being destroyed. This was what he was expecting to see but instead, most of the buildings had already crumbled and there were no visible signs of movement.

'I can't see other Penswi, I can't see the Mermerials or the Amra, at the same time I can't see the enemy either.'

As the ship got closer, he decided to approach the edge of the city rather than the centre. Just in case anything had gone wrong. The ship started to lower and was placed in an open street surrounded by destroyed buildings.

Placing Sil on his back, he descended down the ramp, and quickly went to run between two broken buildings that still had some semblance of a wall left. Looking at the ground he could see clearly now.

It wasn't that there weren't anyone, it was the fact that they were all dead. The Penswi's bodies had been crushed, Mermerial's body parts had been ripped apart, and some looked to have had abilities used on them.

There wasn't just a small number of bodies either, the whole place was littered with them. There were Dalki here and there, as well as humans but there weren't many.

"What is this?" Stark said as he continued to move through the city, still cautious in case there was anyone. "Everything is gone, everything is destroyed. Did they lose the battle, did the alliance already lose the war?"

Using his communication device, he tried to get in contact with the others, how they were doing on the other planets but there was no answer, which was making him feel even more anxious.

"No‚Ä¶ all the Penswi can't be dead. The enemy was strong but not that strong‚Ä¶ and we managed to get Sil. We managed to get the person who will win this war for us." Stark said to himself.

Eventually, he saw a fellow Penswi friend on the ground, he recognised him, he was from one of the other teams that he would constantly go against in the yearly tournament. He lifted his head, his whole body lifeless.

"If I didn't leave, if we were still here, would you have survived?" Stark asked, but the person was unable to answer.

There was a large sense of guilt within Stark right now. He had survived, he had left them to do something else while all of them fought for their lives and in this situation, he felt completely hopeless.

Everywhere he went, even when going closer to the centre of the city he didn't see anyone alive, and it looked like whoever had caused it all had left as well.

'I guess all I can do now is wait for the others somewhere. I bet they will be quite shocked at what happend as well.'

Looking around, Stark had eventually found a building that only had one part of the walls damaged. It was about three floors high and the third floor was mostly intact. When he entered the building he was ready to find a bed of some sort to put Sil down, until he could hear the sound of groaning.

His head turned fast, and he zapped to the person who was on the floor. A large slab of the building had landed on him and his upper chest and head could be seen. Stark quickly put Sil down, and with the armour helping him he was able to push the large slab off his body with relative ease.

The man's legs looked to be crushed. Based on his condition and the strength of his heart beat, it felt like he only had a few moments more to live. Placing Sil on the floor, he lifted the man's head, it was a Mermerial fighter.

"What happened here‚Ä¶ how come‚Ä¶ everyone is dead?" Stark asked.

"The Dalki." The man replied. "They were too strong. The seven spike and the five spikes, they were the one that did this all. Everything."

Stark was hoping for a different answer but it seemed that his fears were true.

"Wait, what about the Blades or Wince, the Mermerial Queen. What happened to them?"Aall ùíèùíÜwest chùíÇptùíÜrs on n.o./vùíÜlùíÉi/n/(.)cùíêm

Stark started to shake the man, as his breath was coming to an end, and he was no longer able to answer.

"The Blades and Wince were strong, but they both weren't able to take out the Dalki, I thought H was the only one we had to worry about."

Climbing the building, Stark went up to the third floor where there was a rock hard bed. He thought Sil had no choice and was unable to complain so placed him on it anyway. In the meantime, he would go searching the dead bodies.

Seeing if he could see any of the Blades or Wince, and maybe someone else that was alive that could answer his questions. Since there was no enemy on the planet anyway he thought it would be safe.

Searching outside, running to the bodies and having a look, he was unable to find any of the Blades or Wince, which was a good sign in a way, but was also unable to find any survivors.

However, he soon did see a weird ship in the sky, when they got closer Stark noticed that it was the others, and a person he didn't quite reagonise to well. Before they landed he started to run, and they knew it was the signal for them to follow him.

In doing so he led them to the place where Sil was. The others all landed, quickly coming off from the ship.

"Where's Sil?" Was the first question Shiro asked.

"He's inside, still asleep."

Shiro went inside, and so did the others, but not before looking around at the same scene that Stark had seen not too long ago. Shaking their heads, first they wanted to see if Sil was okay.

All of them crammed into the room, into the tight space and there was a relief when they saw Sil, it meant that all of their efforts weren't in vain, but now there was another question on their mind.

"What happened here, was it like this when you got here?" Layla asked.

Stark nooded.

"I managed to find one person who was alive. He was able to tell me that the Dalki were the ones who did everything. They said they were just too strong, but I was unable to find any traces of the Blades or Wince."

Both Shiro and Ceril seemed to be concerned about this.

"The one that did all of this is Pine." Logan answered. "He is the one the Dalki follow the most, and is perhaps just a little under H in terms of strength. Although that's only at an estimate as I have not seen either of them fight to their fullest."

Typing away at his robotic arm, Logan was bringing up some information.

"I'm not sure where your friends and allies are, but as for Pine, it looks like he was sent to the next planet over. If that's the case, it won't take him long to create a similar situation as he has done here, over there."
