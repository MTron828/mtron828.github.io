The three, Russ, Quinn and Ceril, were inside the large training room. There were scorch marks, and deep scratches in the place, showing clear signs that the room had been used quite a bit. As a test as well, Quinn made a fist and threw it out hitting the wall.

'It seems this place really is quite sturdy. The Green family really do make some of the most amazing things.' Quinn thought.

Of course, Quinn didn't use his full strength, he doubted there were many rooms that could keep him inside, apart from those that were specifically made for him, like the room that was designed to trap celestials. Although in the end, he had even managed to break out of that.

"Alright, I am waiting for the demonstration to take place." Russ said, tapping his finger on the side of his arm.

Ceril stood in the centre and then closed her eyes for a few seconds, after that, a liquid substance could be seen swirling around her arms. They looked like two snakes that started from the tip of her fingers and went all the way up to her shoulder.

The way it flowed, it looked like water, but the colour of it was red, and it felt like blood aura. Soon, she had grabbed the end of the red rushing water, and swung it around. It was like two whips were in her hand as she lashed them outwards, onto the ground.

When they hit the floor, an explosion of blood aura had been emitted. It was almost similar to Quinn's blood spray skill, where he would use his blood aura at the very end of his fist attack. However, the demonstration didn't stop there.

Even with the whips, there was still blood aura swirling around her body, and she looked to be in control, then swinging out the whips of blood-like water out forward, it had produced several little blood bullets that shot out of the end, all heading towards the wall and splattering out on them.

After the demonstration with the whips were over, Ceril didn't stop there, as she lifted her hands, and almost a wave of red water could be seen behind her, and in the wave were several tridents of blood.

"This… is beyond what I thought." Quinn was looking at her in awe. Although the strength of the blood aura wasn't on the same level of Quinn's, the versatility in her moves were almost the same.

The level of blood control she was showing with her skills was almost the same as if someone had absolute blood control. Something that not even the vampire leaders could do.

"I think that is enough." Ceril commented. "As I said, I think I'm quite strong."Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

"I have to admit that it was pretty impressive." Russ added.

"How are you able to use blood control so well? You didn't become a vampire… well I guess vampire is the wrong word, but you didn't change so long ago. Did you have a teacher?" Quinn asked.

"Blood control?" Ceril said as she lifted her hand, and water was swirling around it instead. "Mitchell did teach me a bit about blood control, but what he tried teaching me was quite difficult, at least for me." She started to explain.

"For us Mermerials, we are creatures of the sea, and we have an innate ability to control water. We can also pull the moisture from the air, and create water as I am doing now." Ceril explained. "However, when I became what I was, and tried to use the blood aura, the power I had was difficult and I found it difficult to control. So instead I decided to mix the blood aura with my water like powers.

"After all, the blood that runs through our body also has a high percentage of water correct? In the end, doing this allowed me to control my new powers in the same way as I would my water powers."

When looking at the Mermerials, Quinn had always found their ability to control water like an ability, but it really wasn't so it was no wonder that Ceril had turned out this way. It was just something that they were naturally able to do.

However, it did make him wonder, mixing things, was it possible? Before abilities couldn't really be mixed because there were those that only had one ability in the first place. That was until Jake Green from the Blade family had come in.

Yet, just like the Mermerials water control was not an ability, and there had been cases of one mixing the two together. For instance, there was the strong ability that could be coated in blood. Quinn had also mixed his Qi with other things but that seemed to be easier, but this gave him an idea.

'Is there a way to mix my blood abilities with the Shadow. How would I even do that, and what would the result of doing such a thing even be?' Quinn thought as he looked at his hand.

Right now, he wished he had his own celestial space where the time slowed down. If he had the time, he was sure he could figure something out.

'Ceril is strong, and maybe with a bit of training in areas, she could be strong enough to take out a leader, or at least fight one of them, but nowhere near strong enough to take out Chris or Peter, not without items and even then I doubt she could do much… we will need more help than this.' Quinn thought as he walked over toward her.

Thinking about Ceril, thinking about items, he had been thinking about this for a while now, but it looked like he had made his decision.

"Ceril… I think the best choice for us, as a group, a place where we can go and feel safe is your home planet. I think we should head to the Mermerial planet."

Sil's power along with the ability, surely had to have a distance limitation. A range where the powers would work from, and he doubted it would work all the way there. The group weren't hostile towards them, and the Mermerials weren't weak either, if just comparing them to the regular vampires.

There was one problem though, if Yongbu, the celestial of the Mermerials, spotted him, and on top of that how to get there. They could head in a general direction, and see if Ceril recognised anything, but other than that it would be quite difficult.

"I like that idea, I would like to see my sister again." Ceril said.

"Wait, I knew this person was from another planet, but do you have any idea on how to get there?" Russ asked.

"I… have an idea." Ceril replied. "I haven't just been sitting in this base doing nothing. There is a lot of information that Logan stores here, and in my spare time I go through it from time to time. There is the flight path that the Marpo Cruise goes through.

"The path doesn't go past the Mermerial planet, but it goes to a section near it. That was how me and my sister had escaped in the first place. It will take me a moment, but if I analyse it for a bit longer. I think I can get us coordinates to that location and we can go from there.

"When I meet my sister, if she remembers you, it will confirm this whole thing for me as well." Ceirl stated.

It looked like it was their only option for now, while on a safe planet, they could try and research where the Blades were. After gathering them, they could decide the next step, Quinn thought.

Ceril had decided to leave the room, in order to do more research and Russ had to make a decision, stay with the pretty light blue skinned girl or stay with Quinn, and he decided to continue following her for now.

"It's okay, we will meet up for dinner, and I will tell my family the news when you have the information." Quinn said. "For now, there is one more thing I need to test, and I think it's better if you guys aren't in here anyway."
