Chapter 2394 ¬†Setting sun (Part 1)

The group looked at all of the other inhabitants that were down in this cellar with them and felt like even if they were to ask the others the same questions, that they would be met with the same answer.

The fact that they would rather be dead, it meant they were in a troubling place to say the least, and the feeling of the place was the same. It was hard to tell if it was the energy that was coming off from these beings or the air itself.

All were quick to notice that the air itself had some sort of energy to it.

"Hey!" Peter said, grabbing the man by the scruff of his neck. They had very loose clothing that looked like rags on them. It hardly covered their body, nor could it be used as any form of armour or such.

"Answer my other questions about Immortui and Quinn!" Peter asked again, thinking that perhaps the person didn't believe in this little threat of his.

Instead though, the man just laughed as if he expected it. Peter threw out his fist straight to the man's face. He couldn't take the cockney laugh. The more time they spent messing around, the higher chance there was that something would happen to Quinn.

He couldn't deal with people the way they were now and it was clear he was on edge, a lot more than usual. Before the fist could hit the man though, an armoured hand grabbed onto Peter's fist stopping it in its tracks.

"Let's not just go around killing people in a world we don't know much about, especially when they're not trying to attack us." Edvard said.

Peter was relatively surprised as he pulled his fist back and let go of the man, alien, whatever it was. He wasn't surprised that his punch had been stopped by Edvard, but the fact it was possible for Edvard to stop the punch.

"That armour must have improved your strength quite a bit." Peter also sounded as if he was sulking.

"Let me try a different approach." Edvard said, getting to eye level as well, he had a large smile on his face and looked a lot more welcoming than Peter. "As you can probably tell, we are not from around here, and we have happened inside here by accident.

"Can you tell us where is here, and what is this place for? Maybe we can help in some way." Edvard said.

His eyes were glowing red when he said these words, he was attempting to use the influence skill, he wasn't sure if it would work or not, and judging by the look in the other person's eyes it hadn't worked.

Seeing the red glowing eyes, the person seemed to have some sort of reaction, looking deeply at Edvard.

"You're right‚Ä¶ I can't figure out what you are." The person said. "You are definitely not a Chrono, or any of the other inhabitants from this world. Could you guys be demons, but if that's the case then why are you here?"

They had learned some information, the beings that were in the cellar with them were known as Chronos, so at least it seemed that Edvard's approach was working a lot better than Peter's, so far at least.

"You guys are quite unlucky to have accidentally come in here." Another Chrono said walking towards them. Their eyes looked dead as well, but a little less compared to the others.

"I saw you come through the portal, so I know the words you say are true." The Chrono said, walking over. It felt unthreatening so the others didn't even react when it got in close to them.

Chris was finding it hard to believe that the one they had faced in the past was the same race as the rest of these.

"It's as the man said, where you guys are right now, could be seen as a type of prison. Although it is hard to call it that, because those that are here haven't committed any crimes, at least most of us." The Chrono started to explain. "This prison is controlled by the demon king, and when the sunlight falls that when hell begins, and don't even think of trying to escape, many have done in the past, and they have all failed, because guarding this place is one of the champions of old."

The group listened to everything the Chrono had said, and he was already turning around, walking the other way as if he had no more to say to them. Even the one that was sitting up against the wall was no longer looking at them and just staring at the ground.

"All your questioning did, was bring us more questions!" Peter complained. "It would have been simpler to beat them, and let the guys come to us, we're going to have to fight them all anyway, with or without Quinn."

"You have to remember this is a whole other universe." Chris stated. "It would be best to just go after our enemy and not make the whole universe our enemy. Besides I'm curious about what he said, do you think this demon king could be Immortui?"

"If that was the case then the fight between him and Quinn would have destroyed this place by now." Sil said. "If anything, I would say that Quinn isn't here due to the lack of fighting. If he came in here with a goal he would be quick to try and complete it. Then again, it could be that Quinn is in a similar situation to us, and is trying to gather information. In the end, if we both try to find Immortui, we should run into each other."

The logic made sense to them all as they nodded away at this, but there was a major worry on all of their minds, they didn't want to waste time.

"I have a suggestion to make." Hikel said. "Someone with the name such as demon king could give us valuable information we need. There is a chance that Quinn might even be here but since we're not sure, we could just be wasting our time.

"I suggest we split up into two groups. With Sil's power, I'm sure he could teleport a group of us out of here. They will continue to search for Quinn on the outside to see how this demon king is doing and if they know anything. There is also this guard that they call the champion as well, but I don't think they're anything we have to worry about."

too busy, I reply back.

Splitting up in a dangerous place wasn't always the best idea, which was why Hikel thought only splitting their force by half was the best choice. Three of them should be strong enough to face most of what they would come across in this world. However, there was another problem, how would they even split up the groups?
