Chapter 2507 Black Swordsman vs Luce

This was it, this was the opportunity that the swordsman was waiting for. The brute force of the hit provided enough power for the swordsman to charge up his own attack.

Gathering his power, the black sword emitted what looked like a ripple of flames. It moved up and down like a chainsaw around the blade. Perfectly positioned, he swung the blade, aiming it right through Luce's neck. As the sword hit, the aura started to do its work.

It rapidly moved around in a circle like a saw, breaking away the strange skin that covered Luce's body. A squirt of blood sprayed out as the sword landed and fell to the floor.

Luce's body went flying to the side and crashed into the ground. Due to the crater created from the explosion, they were fighting in what looked like a large upside-down dome.

After crashing, it didn't take long for Luce to stand on his feet, holding the side of his neck with the palm of his hand. Blood was dripping down his body.

"All of you are incredibly annoying, aren't you?" Luce lifted his hand off his neck, and there was a smudge of blood dripping down, but the wound that had been made had disappeared.

"For f*ck's sake!" Russ screamed internally. "We did all of that for a small scratch on his neck, and he just goes and heals it in a second."

The swordsman didn't know how to reply either; he had so confidently stated that as long as he got an opportunity, he would have been able to finish this fight in one hit.

"We managed to hurt him, though, which means it's possible to kill him as well."

Russ felt the swordsman's confidence, but he wasn't very hopeful in this situation until, for a brief moment, something happened. Luce went to take a step forward, and as he did, he stumbled for a second, and his hand was pressed on his head.

"Was it that punch?" Luce retraced it; he could feel its power, something had gotten through to him. A type of power had breached his defenses. "You?"

Footsteps were heard, and Peter was already upon Luce. Some people might have waited to see the condition of the terrifying demon king that had shown great power, but for Peter, what was the point anyway?

Because he had already decided that he wasn't going to run away, so he might as well continue to keep hitting the other.

The headtails were now wrapped around each of Peter's hands. He threw out a Qi-infused celestial punch, but it was grabbed by Luce, and in turn, he threw a punch back, hitting Peter on the head while continuing to hold onto his fist.

Peter gritted his teeth; even with his hand being held, he continued to try and throw out a punch. It landed cleanly on Luce's body, but it looked as if there was no reaction at all. Still, Peter continued to punch the same spot over and over.

It hit the same spot, targeting his stomach, and eventually, power began seeping through, and Luce felt some pain.

"All of you, all of you are so annoying!" Luce raised his hand, creating the spear again.

This one wasn't dying, no matter what he did, but he was sure that if he stabbed it through the head, it would be the end, or at least the end of the annoying headtails on top. F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When the spear was thrust forward, a strange pulse emitted in the area, a wave of power that went through all of those in the vicinity. When it hit Luce, it delayed him for a moment, and also froze Peter, but there was one person unaffected.

The swordsman clashed his sword against Luce's spear and swung it to the side, landing two hits on his side and thrusting the tip in the center, hitting him in the same spot as Peter had been targeting.

Luce was sent back once again, his feet skidding across the floor. When he looked up, he noticed what the disruption from before was caused by. The horse was standing in the centre of the field.

It was dragging its hooves across the ground, drawing out some type of strange power, and when it lifted its front end and slammed it on the ground, the pulse of power was emitted. When the power coursed through one's body, it caused an instinctive shudder.

It didn't freeze a person, but it made them a bit hesitant as the feeling passed through their bodies, except for the swordsman.

"You are all so annoying!"

Luce charged forward, and he was on the offensive, thrusting the spear and clashing with the sword. He thrust both, and it was hard for the swordsman to keep up. When Peter dived to his side, Luce didn't even turn to look. From his shoulder, a large spike extended out, stabbing him right in the stomach, keeping him suspended in the air.

"ARGHH!" Luce, beyond annoyed, slammed his spear hard, hitting the fingers of the black swordsman, causing them to bleed. If he made him drop that sword, then what? What would be the result?

He continued forward, taking the spike out of Peter, allowing him to drop to the floor, but he didn't realize how resilient Peter was, or the fact that a wound like this wouldn't slow him down.

Or so they thought. Out from his back, several spikes extended out, like when he had killed those from the Divine Brigade. They went all over, piercing Peter in several different parts of his body.

Using the headtails, Peter was protecting his head at all costs.

"Hey, if you don't do anything, that annoying guy is going to die!" Russ exclaimed.

"I'm trying, but his power, it almost feels like it's rising."

The black swordsman dove out of the way, with the aim of trying to help Peter. He leapt up and with his sword, sliced through the spikes and carried Peter away. When looking at where Luce was, he was right next to Dunluck, with a spear through his head.

"That's one annoying thing finally out of the way," Luce claimed, with a smile.

Peter was able to stand, but he had wounds all over, and Russ was left thinking how much longer he could keep up the Black Swordsman's form.

Luce charged forward again, not wanting to give them any time to rest. Peter looked to be the next easiest target in this situation until, from above, dropping down, a sword clashed with Luce's spear, sending it to the ground. With a kick to the stomach and a blast of white energy, Luce was sent back, crashing into the side of the dome flooring.

"And another annoying one joins the party."

A person had joined and interrupted their fight, but why, and who was the person? Russ found the whole situation strange; there was something off. When he looked at Peter, he noticed he was no longer moving, not even blinking, and it felt like even the air had stopped.

"Who is that?"
