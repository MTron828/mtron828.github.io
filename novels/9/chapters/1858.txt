Chapter 1859: The Legendary Blind swordsman. (Part 3)

After saying those words, Leo looked like he was ready to kick it up another gear, and that was exactly what he was doing. Swinging his sword several times he created several blood swipes in the air, all headed towards Erin.

The next moment all of them had split, one strike becoming ten smaller ones, and each of them were being controlled by Leo. Independently, Leo was able to control them well as he attacked from different angles in different areas all at once.

Seeing how moving the large blade would make it harder for her to defend herself, Erin changed to her own Katana blade. While doing so, several strikes were coming from one direction. Throwing out her free hand, an invisible strike of Qi came out destroying them and causing them to disintegrate.

This was stage three Qi and Erin was quite skilled at using it. She soon turned to face the next set of attacks that were coming from behind and mid-air, she slashed her sword against a few more, destroying them, but in the end, the attacks that were coming her way were just too many for her to handle.

Several strikes from the side had hit her. They grazed her skin, but using the strong energy that she had from within, she emitted her yellow aura in a similar way that she would have with the second stage of Qi. It caused all of the attacks to just give her a few scratches, but for Erin it was the first time in a long time she had been injured.

The feats that Leo was accomplishing with his sword was something that not just anyone could do. Although Leo's blood weapon allowed him complete blood control of his attack, that was all it did.

Vampires, who had good blood control, could give orders or instructions to their blood to do as they wished. For Leo it was the same, yet at the same time very different. With his ability, and his mind, he was able to know where each of his blood strikes were at any point and time.

Even when breaking up his single blood strike with the sword's ability to create ten more, with his vision, he knew where each one was going to move. He could predict and act accordingly, allowing him, 99 percent of the time, to be successful with his attack.

‚Äî Try again! ‚Äî Leo shouted, as he swung his sword the same amount of times as he did in the air before. Five strikes broke into ten causing fifty strikes that she had to deal with. Erin was doing similar things, moving away, using her third stage of Qi, and her dhampir energy to stop the attacks that were hitting her, but she was still ending up being hit.

‚Äî You have gotten worse after leaving me! ‚Äî Leo shouted. ‚Äî Didn't my discipline teach you anything? I know exactly what you are thinking. If only I could draw out more energy, then I could get rid of all of these attacks.

‚Äî And although that might be true, it is not true for the situation you are in now. You need to do what you can to get out of this bind!

Erin was frustrated, and even more so because Leo was right. She was thinking exactly his thoughts. A lot of the dhampir's strength came from the vampires she was facing. She could tell Leo was strong because her dhampir powers responded.

At the same time, during her time hunting vampires, she realized how much strength a vampire truly had based on how much strength she would get in return. In a way, this always made Erin at least equal when it came to whoever she was fighting.

However, there were more pros to Erin than that. For one, if she was fighting against a vampire as well, although the energy and strength was equal it also truly wasn't, because dhampir energy had an effect on vampire energy. It was like pitting water against fire.

Then there were all the other strengths that Erin had. Her Qi, the demon tier weapons that improved her even if she wasn't using them, and her fighting skills. With all of this, fighting against any vampire no matter how strong they were, she should win.

Which was why she was struggling, the energy she was getting back wasn't that strong, it indicated that Leo wasn't such a strong vampire. Of course, he had great energy but not compared to that of the vampire leaders, not even that of Nico who she had killed. Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

Yet why was this then proving to be such a difficult fight, that was clearly one sided. She even had the same ability as Leo.

‚Äî Since you aren't improving, then let's try something else. Trying the same thing again and again is madness, so I will try something else. ‚Äî Leo sprinted in with his sword glowing red, and threw out a strike towards her.

Erin had barely managed to block it in time, when the two swords connected though, she could feel her energy was stronger. It gave her confidence. Regardless, she realized that wouldn't matter soon, as attack after attack was coming from Leo, at hard and odd angles, that was making Erin turn and twist herself in odd ways so that she was unable to get stable footing for herself.

Chris was watching everything from the side. He could see that Leo was doing well, incredibly well and better than he thought he would against this apparently big threat. Still, if he needed to, then he would come in and help Leo, so he was ready to jump in at any second.

‚Äî Leave him be. ‚Äî A voice said.

The voice was heard from behind, and it sent shivers all around Chris's body. He didn't want to turn around, because he knew exactly who it was.

‚Äî So you followed me after all, ‚Äî Chris answered.

‚Äî Are you going to get involved, because if you do, I'm afraid to say, I'm going to have to stop you.

In the end, Chris couldn't avoid it and had to turn around, and there he could see that Zero was in sight. Seemingly out of nowhere he had appeared, and this time it was in front of Leo as well. Whether Leo knew he was here or not, Chris was unaware, but he didn't want him to distract him from the fight.

‚Äî Move away, ‚Äî Chris said. ‚Äî You are not getting involved in this.

‚Äî Don't worry, I won't be. ‚Äî Zero replied.

While the two were having their conversation, Silver was also having a tough fight on her own, but in the end, she started to win out. The use of her strings had done her well, and at the same time due to a certain someone, she had gotten better with the sword.

It looked like their battle was soon to come to an end, as the dhampir was on the floor, and Silver stood above her.

‚Äî How is Leo doing? ‚Äî Silver thought.

When she looked up, she could see that Leo was pushing and pushing, and then for the first time a sword strike looked like it was going to hit Erin, but it slowed down, allowing Erin to block in time, and Silver wasn't the only one that noticed.

‚Äî Are you... are you not even trying to attack me? ‚Äî Erin replied, she had done so with such anger that she placed the blade away on her side and took out the demon tier sword once more, striking down with flames being dragged behind the weapon and crashing it into the floor.

‚Äî You... why are you doing this! ‚Äî Erin shouted as she started to swing her sword wildly attacking, as flames followed behind it. Now Leo was on the defensive but it was easy for him to avoid each of the attacks.

‚Äî Are you pitying me, you of all people. You don't get to do that. I will take everything away from you, just like you did to me! ‚Äî Erin screamed at the top of her lungs and ran forward.

Leo lept back, and then the second his feet touched the ground, he leapt to the side, because he knew what she was going to do next.

The ring on the sword started to light up and a tunnel of fire came shooting out from the weapon, but it was twice the size of the last attack. Erin's emotions and powers from her dhampir aura seemed to also affect the demon tier weapon making the attack stronger.

The flame had only missed Leo by a small margin.

‚Äî Now... it's time for you to lose something as well. ‚Äî Erin smiled, as the flames of the tunnel were heading straight towards Silver and it was too quick for her to move out of the way.
