Chapter 965 - The Cursed faction Influence (Part 1)

The next day, in the early morning, the two kids Venus and Swin who were staying in the same room together woke up dreading heading into class. Based on how Erlen had acted before, they were worried that he might already be planning his next move, and they had seen this happen with other students in the past.

’Maybe if we get close with that Sil kid, Erlen will stop messing with us?’ Venus thought.

He couldn’t stop thinking about what great power, Sil had displayed. How he had completely overpowered a strong ice user. He was calm throughout the whole fight, and didn’t get a scratch on him. They were surprised that such a strong student was in their class, even more so that he would help them.

’No, I can’t get him involved. What if Erlen tries something worse?’ Venus thought, and at that moment, Venus noticed that he had a ton of missed messages from his parents.

Before, in the old military bases, there were only certain periods when one could get in contact with their families. However, this year the military were trying to be a bit different, and this was also a request of those from the Graylash and Cursed faction if they were to send kids from their factions over to the military base.

Most of them were voice messages, and he thought that it might be nice to hear his mom’s voice after a while, but when he listened to message after message, he was devastated about what he had heard.

His emotions were so mixed, he couldn’t even blink and didn’t know how to react at all. His body remained frozen in place.

"Venus I don’t know why, but your father, he’s been fired from the company!" His Mum sounded panicked and distraught on the phone. Usually, his mother would have tried to hide something like this from him, so that he wouldn’t worry, however the last message made it clear why she had told him.

"I don’t know what’s happened, but they said that if he wanted to get his job back, then they should ask our son about it. Please, if you know anything can you tell us what happened?"

Venus sat there on his bed, playing the messages to himself over and over again, thinking about what had happened, and when he looked across the room, he could see that Swin had an equally shocked look on his face.

It turned out that Venus wasn’t the only one that had been affected by this, but also Swin as well. They didn’t need to put their minds together for this one, it was obvious who was doing it all.

"Erlen, he really did it..." Venus mumbled. He had to say it out loud to make sure that it wasn’t a dream.

Of course, they both knew that Erlen wasn’t lying about his father, but no matter what happened in the past while in school, he had never got his parents involved in such a thing. Who would get their parents involved when it was a problem between them. It made no sense to attack other people.

Unfortunately for them, the bad news didn’t stop there, as the bell rang to their dormitory door.

"This is Sargent Himmle, please open up. You have been called into a meeting with Head General Innu." Himmle said, spoken through the door.

The two boys looked at each other and gulped. They truly didn’t know what to do now and didn’t know what to expect.

——

Being called by the sergeant, and having a meeting with a head general felt like a serious thing. They knew Erlen was influential but not this influential and they could see their whole lives being ruined. Neither boy said anything, as they moved from their building and headed towards where the third group’s building was based.

They entered a medium sized meeting room, where there was a desk, and a bookshelf on either side of the walls. Towards the left side of the room, were two sofas and a table and on one of the sofas, was an older gentleman in a suit, and sitting next to him was Erlen.

Erlen’s father looked at the students with disgust as they turned their heads avoiding eye contact.

From his seat Innu had stood up.

"Please take a seat, we are still waiting for everyone to arrive." Innu said, walking over, and standing on the other side. Even the sergeant that had brought them there was standing on the other side, and it really felt like everyone in the room was against them too, with no one to back them up.

Soon though, Shiro had been brought into the room by another sergeant, and sat down on the sofa with them, and finally, both Chucky and Sil had been brought in as well and were seated down.

Looking across them, seeing both Shiro and Sil, Erlen wasn’t feeling the happiest seeing them.

’My father was able to do something about Venus and Swin, but these other three. Shiro, turned out to be an orphan so there was nothing we could do to his family, and as for the other two, known as Sil and Chucky, we also couldn’t find any information at all. Oh well, I’ll just have to be happy with what they’re about to get.’

Innu wasn’t the only one that was going to be a part of the meeting, eventually the other two Earthborn head generals had entered as well Samantha and Sach.

’Now the others can see me getting a little payback for the humiliation we received.’ Innu thought.

"What’s going to happen to us?" Shiro eventually said, his voice a little shaky.

"Don’t worry, you’re only students, but what you have tried to do to my son is a big crime." Erlen’s father spoke, and that had quietened Shiro down a lot. "So don’t expect a slap on the wrist." Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He thought he might get in trouble or use the beast weapon on the fellow student. This would be placed on his record, and his chances of getting into the Graylash family might be stained. With a powerful family out to get him, they would make it so his report would deem him more useless then he already was.

’No one is going to help us.’ Shiro thought. ’No one is on our side and even those two that helped us before can’t do anything.’

He looked to his right, and could see Sil and Chucky sitting quite calmly on their seats. Did they really not fear what was about to happen to them, did they not care about their record or score they would get when leaving this palace.

’Oh that’s right, these two are already strong, they don’t need to worry.’

"I wouldn’t be so calm if I were you two." Innu said. "A matter like this could very well mean an expulsion, and expulsion from the military may be a fate worse than the lowest grading students and we will be sure to let your faction, and everyone know about what you did today. Do you think anyone will be willing to take those in that attack their own?"

Still, Innu’s threats did nothing, as Chucky remained calm, and even Sil gave a little yawn.

The door opened, one more time, and the last person who had entered the room was Quinn.

"Head General Hardy, it looks like you made it!" Innu said, being polite and putting on a smile.

Straight away, seeing Sil and Chucky involved in this incident, he was a little calm, but soon after he could hear the other students’ panicked heartbeat. It was clear they were nervous and scared. Quinn walked over by their side and stood behind them.

"What happened?" Quinn asked.

Samantha, seeing this, could feel an immense pressure coming off him. She didn’t know what Innu was planning to do, but in the end, thought that she should come along, just for his sake. From that day onward after the meeting with Oscar, she couldn’t get his words out of her head.

’Don’t do anything stupid Innu.’ She thought.
