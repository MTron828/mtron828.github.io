Chapter 2342 ¬†No Talking!

In the middle of the forest, standing at the back, Peter could see the Boneclaw right there. It looked the same as he remembered, with its large muscular body, displaying flesh from the top half while its bottom half was covered by a black ripped cloth. Its bony spine that stuck out, along with its sharp elbows.

The most notable feature of the Boneclaw, though, was its large long arms, and its dangling long deadly claws that scraped the bottom of the floor. It was one that would give many people nightmares if they saw it. ¬†It was familiar, one of the strongest ones in existence since it was part of the four kings, but that was why Peter was so mad because he could remember it well.

The Boneclaw originally belonged to Richard Eno and helped him in his ploys. Through its visions Quinn had learnt it played a big part in tricking Arthur and creating what was known as the Punishers. But after that, it wandered around the vampire settlement for a while before it attached itself to Quinn.

The reason as to why the Boneclaw attached itself to Quinn was unknown. Was it his strong energy, his desire, or something else, maybe it was still following orders from Richard Eno. Either way it had helped Quinn through his journey and saved his life at times.

When Quinn had fought with Graham, he needed to go into eternal slumber to rest, and in doing so, he had given up the Boneclaw.

When the owner of familiars died, it was assumed that the familiar would die with them, but from what they had learned, it was more likely that they just returned to the familiar world waiting to make a new contract with someone else.

Of course, this could have just been the case with the four kings. They were so strong and full of energy that they were able to survive in this world even without a host or contract. Either way, when the Boneclaw came back, not just the Boneclaw, but the four kings had all decided to host in a single person, Erin Heley.

The leader of the dhampirs and the one that was going against Quinn. It had made things more difficult for them when trying to take out Erin, and now, the betrayer, the disloyal mutt in Peter's eyes, was attacking them once again.

"Haha!" Peter started to laugh. "This is great, you know, I never liked how you were by his side and was supposedly supposed to be always protecting him when he needed it most. Now you're attacking the entire vampires with your army of familiars. I can't wait to bring you all down!"

Peter charged forward, running through the woods. His arm had hit a large tree, but he didn't care nor did he let it slow him down as it went right through it.

"Peter wait, I mean Quinn wait!" Muka corrected herself. She was lucky that there was no one else around. "We don't know why they are attacking. This could be a trap!"

The Boneclaw lifted its hands, and in doing so, several portals opened around the area. Coming right out from them were familiars. Peter raised his hand, the yellow aura started to cover it.

All of the familiars went toward Peter, and it looked like his whole body was encased by them, but the next moment a blast of energy came out from his fist, so large that it consumed all of the familiars, making them disappear on the spot.

When his feet touched the ground, using his strength Peter exploded off the floor right toward the Boneclaw. He threw out his fist but it had hit nothing but the air.

Peter felt a tingling sensation coming from his right. He couldn't see the Boneclaw, but it was almost as if he knew that it was there. He swung his arm out, covered in the outer energy he was able to form, and it clashed against the large claws, swinging the Boneclaw's arm wide.

"Did you think I forgot about your crappy teleporting power!" Peter shouted as he followed up with a punch, but the Boneclaw quickly moved out of the way again and was now up high on a branch while more of the other familiars came in.

One looked like a giant ostrich, but when it opened up its mouth, flames went out all over Peter's body. Covering his head and the rest of himself with both arms, he was unhurt by the flames and directly went to grab the bird creature's long neck.

"Get the f*ck out of my way!" Peter screamed as he pulled on the neck and kicked the bird creature's body, leaving only the head of the familiar in his hands.

It would have been a bloody sight if it was a beast, but thankfully it was a familiar, and when the two parts were separated, they turned into nothing but particles of energy that were disappearing.

"That Boneclaw, he's fast with his teleporting, but he can't hurt me with my current strength," Peter thought. "If I was able to use my celestial form, then my head tails would be quick enough to catch him and get him off guard... but I promised her, I promised her while I was pretending to be Quinn that I wouldn't transform into that form."

Muka was dealing with her own troubles. She was fighting off familiars in the forest as well, and she was also debating whether or not to go back to the settlement because she was sure that they were somewhat struggling.

"Alright... it looks like we might have made a mistake," a voice echoed. It wasn't coming from the Boneclaw, but it seemed like it was coming from somewhere else.

Peter and Muka were looking around, but they were unable to locate where the sound was coming from. What they did notice was that in the forest, they were still surrounded by a number of familiars. They had created a type of ring around the two, but none of them were moving in like before.

"I think it is best that we talk because it looks like this current situation isn't good for both of us," the voice said again. ViiSiit nùíêvelbùíä/n(.)c/(ùíê)m for lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels

Now looking at the Boneclaw, there seemed to be a black cat that was seen on its shoulder. This was Ovinnik, another one of the four kings, one that used to belong to Leo at one point, but once again, just like the Boneclaw, they had teamed up with Erin.

"You attacked us first, and now you want to talk!" Peter laughed. "What is it, is it because you realize that you're too weak to beat us?"

Muka wanted to tell Peter to shut up because she wanted to know the reason for the attack in the first place, but she felt like he was right. Why talk now? Why did the familiars not try to talk to them before? Was it Peter's strength? Or another trick by whoever had orchestrated this?

"In our desperate situation, we were unable to think straight. I assure you as well, this is something that we never wanted to do," Ovinnik stated. "The situation is not like we thought, and honestly, we are surprised to see that you are still here, Quinn."

Muka was surprised to hear this. They referred to Quinn by his name, and the way they were talking about him, it was as if he was dead.

"You want to talk? Well, right now you guys are the only ones giving us trouble, so you can talk to my fist!" Peter shouted as he jumped high from his position and headed straight for the two of them.

"Wait!" Muka set off following right behind Peter.

Seeing this, the Boneclaw waved his hand, and a portal had opened in front of the two of them. They entered the portal and landed on the ground, but where they landed, it was not the same world they were in before.

The two of them were now in the familiar world.
