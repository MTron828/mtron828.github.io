Chapter 2506 Russ vs Luce

The power of the Black Swordsman, his own body drawn from his own memories of how powerful he was, now stood on the battlefield. It firmly held its sword by its side as it took steps in the crater, encircling Luce.

Unlike before, Russ had been careful not to use a large amount of MC cells, and thanks to his god slayer item, he was able to absorb a substantial number of MC cells as well, allowing him to use this power a bit longer than before.

"Haha, what is this? You think just because you've changed, things will be different now? That's very unlikely," Luce exclaimed.

He went to move forward, but when he did, a large slash cut through the air, and a dark aura emanated from the sword, cutting up the ground. Seeing this, Luce transformed his arm into a shield and was pushed back by the force until it eventually stopped.

Usually, this attack produced by the Black Swordsman would have the same effect as the sword itself. Anything it touched that had an energy force, and not a life force, would disappear.

But just as Luce claimed, his powers were now a part of him as well, so they wouldn't just disappear.

"You are quick to react, but I am far better than you!" Luce charged forward, and the Black Swordsman swung his sword twice.

The attacks went through the ground and the air, leaving large lines of aura that almost pierced the sky and continued forward. The attacks didn't go straight at Luce but instead passed right by his side.

While the swordsman himself dashed forward and swung a large blow from below. Seeing this, forming out of Luce's hand, was a spear, and he swung it down, both of them clashing against each other and going toe to toe.

With his other hand, Luce had formed another spear and shoved it forward, aiming to stab the swordsman in the head. He was able to avoid the blow and deflect the other spear.

Two spears were thrusting back and forth, constantly, while the swordsman was deflecting them all, taking a step back, one at a time, blocking all the blows.

"Come on!" Russ shouted in his head. "When I gave you the go-ahead to take this fight, I thought you were going to deal with this straight away, just like you did with that Dalki."

"If you have fought this person, then you should know as well that it's not that easy!" The sword replied. "Their speed, strength, and their power. Even with my powers, it seems as if the negative energy attacks aren't getting through. It looks like only the sword itself is going to be able to hurt him."

"If your powers aren't working against them, then aren't you just a useless swordsman?"

The Black Swordsman quickly shifted his feet to the side and held his sword with both hands. A swing from above his head, and black aura was unleashed, hitting the two spears dead on.

They swung his whole body off balance, and with the sword by his side, he struck again, landing a large strike right across the side of Luce's body.

Luce's white-coloured skin had a slight marking left on it, like a chalk mark on the wall. Although it might have been insignificant to most, it was the first mark on his body that they had achieved since he had turned into this form, even if it didn't draw blood.

When close, though, Luce stretched out parts of his body, extending out like the wall, and several spikes emerged. With a sweeping motion, the swordsman blocked half of the strikes, but the other half pierced through his leg.

Quickly, the swordsman jumped back, blood falling from him. Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

"I have to admit, you are skillful. Perhaps if you were fighting any of the other demon kings, you would be strong enough to have bested them. Unfortunately, you are going up against me," Luce claimed.

There was worry on Russ' mind, and it was about how much longer this fight would last. Russ did have more MC cells, so he could summon the Black Swordsman for longer, but he was hoping to go against an opponent where he could use his god slayer item consistently.

In a way, with the god slayer item, it would allow him to use his power and go on, but in this situation, he was going against the one opponent that made things difficult for him.

However, there was one thing going for Russ. The Black Swordsman summoned here was stronger than the one Sil had summoned, and there was a simple reason for that. Russ had used the imagination of the sword, which believed itself to be incredibly strong.

While the swordsman that Immortui had faced was one that he had bested before. It was long ago, and there was next to no worry in his fight against him.

"If only there was a distraction, an opportunity to strike, this would be a lot easier."

Luce came forward with both spears again, and when he thrust one forward, two spikes grew out from the pole part of the spear.

Even though the Black Swordsman had deflected the spear, now from the side, he was being attacked by the weapon itself. He tilted his head in time to avoid a lethal blow, but the other spear came towards him.

"ARGHH!" Charging the sword, it was covered in the same black aura it would release, and swirling it around, he forced one spear to hit another.

"I just need a moment, a perfect moment to strike!" The swordsman thought.

If he got that perfect moment, he would put his all into a strike to the neck and finish this demon with everything he had.

"NEIGHHH!" A loud sound of a horse rippled through the air. It was piercing to all those who heard it, affecting their insides.

The horse had appeared, and it was going through the air covered in a blue mist. Peter was riding on the back of it, both his head tails covering his hand, and at just the right moment, using the momentum and speed of Dunluck, he jumped in the air.

"EAT SH*T!" Peter screamed, as he swung his mighty fist right into Luce's face. It was a direct hit. The power was explosive with Qi and the added speed. Not only that, but there was something else, Peter's fist had celestial energy in it.

As the hit touched Luce's face, part of the white substance, it looked as if it was splitting apart, and it was splitting his skin as well.

"This is it!" The Black Swordsman had quickly gone to the side; this was the opening he needed. His sword glowing with black aura, he swung it right for the neck.

"Let's end this!"
