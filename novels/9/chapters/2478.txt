The group were ready, they were ready to head to the golden temple and face one of the demon kings, the goal was to go all out from the beginning and that way it would give the chance for Russ to do what Sil would have done. 

What they didn't expect was for the demon king to suddenly appear where they were. For him to land right on the very ship that the group was on. The demon king himself had no idea they were here, but it only took a single look to know that they were intruders. 

"Everyone, it's now or never, fight!" Hikel shouted. The marking on his body started to glow and blood aura swirled around his body forming some type of ball.

The blood aura was spinning, but then it came out like a barrage of large blood swipes and right toward Bisha. The attacks had landed clean on his body and when they did they all exploded at once creating a big dust of explosion.

Russ, seeing this as an opportunity, decided to use Sil's teleportation power. He disappeared and reappeared right by Bisha's behind.

'I don't really know how Sil's power works, so I hope it will be okay!' Russ thought as he reached out, but his hand had been stopped. It was inches away from Bisha's skin, but he was unable to touch it. 

Russ had then transformed his arm into that of the powerful Dalki, changing its shape and size and tried to push, but it wasn't working at all. 

'What is this that's on his body?' Russ thought. 

On a closer look, there was a mist of red that had surrounded Russ' palm. It had actually condensed nearly all around Bisha's body. It was the red mist in the air. The cloud of explosion had disappeared, and Bisha was there with a large smile on his face. 

"Haha, that kinda hurt a little, I guess there is a reason why Immortui was a little afraid of you!" Bisha shouted. 

With his shout, the red energy in the air, and near his body was pouring out. It hit everyone in the area like a wave, and started to push them away. The one that was most affected by this was none other than Russ. 

He had been pushed further and further away, until he was several metres away. Using his teleportation powers, he shifted in closer again but the closer he got to this power the more it was hurting him as well. 

It was affecting his mind, hurting it. With his other arm free, Russ started to cover himself with the well known shadow power, the power that was known to block nearly anything. 

The shadow had managed to shield him from the headache that he had, but he was still being pushed away by the red energy. 

"I see, one of you is trying something right? Well, I won't be stupid enough to let you get your way!"

Bisha raised his hand in the air, and the mist had gathered. Red ball of mist had surrounded his hand, an orb of energy, then Bisha swung it out, aiming straight for Russ. 

'A physical attack? Even if I use the black sword right here, it won't be able to block this!' Russ thought. 

An opponent that was mostly physical in strength, it was one of the harder types for him to go against. He could change his body to be physically stronger, but stronger than a demon king, his opponent, it was impossible, at least with the MC cell's he had. So he had to try to use a mixture of changing his physical body and powers, but even that would use up much of his MC cells.

Another attempt was made to teleport away, but when he did, Russ could feel his body being sucked into where the red energy of Bisha's fist was. 

Several white coloured claw marks went through the air, and bashed into Bisha's fist. It had stopped the motion of the fist for a few seconds, and soon after an explosive sound was heard as a red coloured werewolf had kicked off a Qi platform he had created in the air. 

Slowing down the fist, Chris had arrived and with the strength in both of his arms, he knocked into the fist head on. An explosive power of Qi surged out of his claws and the fist was knocked away, even breaking the red energy. 

'I am stronger… I am stronger than before. We can do this, with everyone here, we can do this! We don't need to rely on Russ' mind changing power!'

Chris wasn't the only one that had thought this. Hikel had already landed on the other arm of the giant Yak, and was running up the side of it. His entire arms were glowing, and he quickly ran right past the Yak's neck. 

With his arm he made a giant slashing motion, and the red blood aura lingered in the air, cutting through his neck, and part of the blood having managed to get inside, it was time for the explosions. 

A huge explosion went right off in the Yak's neck, on the cut that had been made. It startled Bisha as blood and pain was felt in his body. Something he hadn't experienced in a long time. 

His head was thrown to the side, but that wasn't the end of the punishment. An opportunity arose as he stumbled, he had lifted his leg slightly and down below there was one more. A person who had great strength in his fists. 

Peter had transformed into his celestial mode, and summoned the two head tails from the top of his head. Both of them had wrapped around his arms drawing all the power from within, and right on the demon king's ankle, he punched with all his might. 

The flesh vibrated as the attack hit with explosive energy and it wasn't just one hit. Peter continued to punch again and again. 

"ARGHHH! We need to hurry, and save Quinn!" Peter shouted as he continued to hit the Yak. 

Now, as he was toppling over, each of them decided to participate. Chris was throwing his claws as much as possible. Hikel with his blood arua, and Russ had even gathered lightning and fire to blast at the Bisha. 

"We are not weak!" Chris shouted at the top of his lungs, as he continued to throw energy claw after claw at Bisha. They didn't stop, they could tell they were close, with all of them they could do it, before Immortui found out. 

"Oh, you're not weak, you said." A voice was heard from Chris' right side. As he turned his head he could see a figure floating in the sky wearing white clothing. "I shall be the judge of that." 

Luce, Immortui's right hand man, had arrived.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
