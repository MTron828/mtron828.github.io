Chapter 978 - The Punisher Title

When Quinn had decided to come to the fourteenth castle, he expected to find some secrets. Either skill books or maybe learn more about the shadow. What he wasn’t expecting, was to find a throne made out of pure blood crystals and once sitting in it, to receive a title.

’Leader of the Punishers?’ Quinn read out in his mind. It was clear what the title meant, but unfortunately, Quinn was unable to see the details of the title or what effects it would bring. It looked like the system wanted him to either accept or decline the offer at this very moment.

Titles were very powerful things, given certain buffs when fighting and also other things. Allowing him to gain reputation points and even building the towers at the tenth castle, but this was why he was struggling with the decision.

’If I choose to accept this title, does it get rid of the one from the tenth family?’

So far no titles had been lost, there was even one that could be selected that was a stark reminder of his dear friend Edward, however it could never be used to its full capacity now. Still, it seemed this one would conflict with his others, but perhaps he could just switch between them when needed like the tenth title.

’I believe the system will possibly warn you like in a game.’ Vincent chimed in. ’Think about it, when you select yes on this title, it should proceed by saying, accepting this title will get rid of xx title. I played quite a few games in my past.’ Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

’Vincent is a gamer, and he’s clearly proud of it.’ Quinn thought, honestly if the tenth title did disappear it would only be in the system anyway. Surely, Bryce and the other council members would still think of Quinn as the leader, regardless of what the system said.

The thing he would lose most was the towers. At this point, Quinn was leaning towards accepting the title, and he had nearly selected yes, but there was one last thing that was troubling him.

’What will happen to Arthur, what will he think? Will he know I have taken over his castle, or will he think I have decided to become a part of the Punishers and part of the vampire settlement?’

In the end, it was this thought that caused Quinn to push yes and accept the title. Arthur was coming and he needed every bit of help and power that was needed.

[The title ’Leader of the Punishers’ has been granted]

[Reputation points will be granted based on how fellow Punishers respect you]

[The store can now be used in the fourteenth zone]

As soon as Quinn accepted the title, the seat started to light up slightly, and Kazz was getting ready to get out of the place, but soon the light dimmed and disappeared. In Kazz’s eyes, not much had changed, but quite a few things in Quinn’s system had been updated.

The first set of rewards were similar to what Quinn got when he had received the tenth title. He got reputation points that were based on how people from that family looked at you, although he wasn’t sure what Punishers meant. Did it include Arthur, or all those that he had taught the shadow skill to.

The good thing was it looked like the reputation points earned from the tenth leader title could be used to build things in the fourteenth zone. On top of this, the titles were able to be switched out to each other. There was no loss of the tenth leader title.

’Maybe it’s best not to build anything for now. Although I have accepted this title, I don’t want the other families to know about it. Besides, who would attack a castle with no people, who or what do I have to protect?’

The next set of rewards were more based on skills that could be used while Quinn was in the fourteenth area and had the title active.

[While in the fourteenth zone, the user may borrow and give their shadow to other Punishers at will]

Before when Quinn had borrowed the shadow from the others, it was forcefully taken but after speaking to them, they willingly wanted to help Quinn out at the time.

’It’s a shame that it’s only limited to the fourteenth area, but it just means I have to increase my shadow as much as I can in the first place.’

Other than that, there didn’t seem to be any grand rewards, so Quinn decided to check out the map that would show him to the area of the fourteenth castle. When looking through this, Quinn also noticed something else a bit off about the castle map itself.

When going to his location, he could see that even where he was right now, there was another room behind them, behind the throne.

Quinn immediately stood up, which caused Kazz to jump back a few feet.

"Quinn, tell me now, have you gone mad!" Kazz said. "Has that chair taken over your mind?!"

Quinn looked at her for a few seconds.

"I’m glad to know that you won’t outright attack me and at least ask me first," Quinn replied with a smile.

Walking up to the wall behind the throne. Quinn could see a giant rug like material that had been hung behind the wall. Ripping it off to the side, another circle combination lock could be seen.

Going up to it, Quinn wondered something and grazed his fingers against the lock.

[Would you like to unlock the door?]

Quinn didn’t think much of it, and the wheel started to turn itself until it eventually unlocked for him on the spot, and started to push itself open.

"I thought you didn’t know any of the combinations to the locks?" Kazz asked.

"This one didn’t need one." Quinn lied and started to walk through the secret door.

Kazz was a little hesitant following, but soon did, and she stayed away from the red crystal throne, acting as if it was bad luck if it was to touch her.

When they had entered the room, she could see Quinn standing there still, and surrounding him were pieces of rubble all over the floor.

"What is this? Did you do this?" Kazz asked.

"You would have heard me if I did," Quinn said, lifting one of the pieces of rubble, and Kazz had done the same as well.

Quinn didn’t know what he was expecting, but he wasn’t expecting this. It seemed like the room had several walls that had certain things written on them, or ill.u.s.trations but it had all been destroyed and quite recently as well.

"Damn him!" Kazz yelled. "This was a training room, one that would teach the others how to use the shadow. Some of the other leaders have rooms like this as well, but it’s useless like this."

Quinn had thought the same thing. The words didn’t need to be written down in a book, but it looked like all the techniques that Arthur had learned over the years had been drawn out and explained on the walls of this large room.

’In the past, it was a quick way to teach one your ability. You would lock them in a room, and with all the ill.u.s.trations and text with no distractions, the person would get into a certain state. They would feel as if the words and text from the walls were coming out to them.’ Vincent explained.

’Why did he destroy it? Did he think the other vampires would come back and try to learn the powers? Was he stopping them from getting the shadow ability, or was he stopping me?’ Quinn thought.

However, perhaps Arthur was missing one important detail about Quinn. He didn’t know Quinn was different to other vampires, and different to the other Punishers. For he also had the system.

[Inspect]

Details of each piece of broken rubble were seen, and the system started to fill up a small progress bar.

[Gathering information about the shadow]

[You have successfully learnt more about the shadow.]

Although Quinn still was unable to teach others the shadow properly, he had gained far more than he had expected from this little trip.

’Whatever you were hoping to do Arthur, I’m catching up to you.’
