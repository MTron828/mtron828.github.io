Chapter 2519 ¬†Stick to the Goal

Chris looked down at his hands; he was still in his stage four Qi form, giving his fur a red appearance. It wasn't the only thing that was present. Black flames surrounded the outside of his hands; they were flowing as if active, yet he felt no pain in his hands at all.

"These flames, I've seen them before. They look exactly like the ones Shinto and Hinto both used, but why can I use them?"

After consuming Shinto's body, Chris felt re-energized as he normally did. A surge of power coursed through his entire body; on top of that, the large wound that was across his chest had healed up as well.

In order to test out his newfound strength, he would usually clench his fist. It was a good indication of how much power he had gained because he could feel his own grip strength.

Doing so, he had activated the black flames unconsciously. It was the first time such a thing had happened. Chris had gained new strength and new powers related to that of a werewolf, but it was the first time, since consuming someone, he had gained their powers, the special trait of the Chrono, the black flames that only those at the pinnacle could reach.

"Shinto, I guess you really did pass on everything you had over to me," Chris thought.

The other two champions, seeing this, were gaining new hope once again. They saw the new strength, and if they could pile their power onto Chris', it might just work. They readied themselves as they tried to come up with at least half the resolve that Shinto had.

That was until they could hear rumbling. Turning around, they could see the floor being ripped apart and a large tsunami wave of rocks heading their way.

Unzoku was no longer mesmerized by his powers and had decided to strike again. The attack was fast and powerful, and it looked like this time it would hit the champions. Before the attack swept them, they felt both of their bodies being grabbed and lifted.

When they could see again, they were looking at the side view of the attack, and Chris was by their side.

"Did he just pull us out of that attack in time? Just how fast is he?" Calva thought.

The trail of destruction was just as large as before as it tore through the city. It had surely taken out a chunk of allies and enemies that were still fighting behind them.

"You two stay alive," Chris said. "We fight to save people, and originally, although I wanted to kill Unzoku, I know the goal is to only get his blood, with the strength I have now, I can do it."

Before the others could say anything, Chris had already rushed forward. Unzoku could see this coming his way, and swung his once again. The ground was getting torn up, but Chris continued forward.

Since the attack was large and it emanated from the user's claw, it meant that there were large gaps as well. As the energy claw came towards Chris, he jumped up and created a Qi platform by his feet at the side of it. Kicking himself off it, he boosted himself forward and swung a flurry of swipes at Unzoku.

only that, some were stuck to the outside fur on his hands.

Looking at his own hands, it seemed like the flames weren't coming Unfazed by the small energy attacks, Unzoku used his own hands to block them all. They were clashing against his claws one after the other, as they did small black flames appeared around him and not only that, some were stuck to the outside fur on his hands.

Looking at his own hands, it seemed like the flames weren't coming off them.

"What is this strange power?" Unzoku thought.

Through his claws, he could see a small werewolf coming his way. Immediately, Unzoku went to strike with his hand, but with Chris' speed, he was able to avoid it, and as he did, he swung his claws again several times.

The strikes hit his legs; they hadn't done much damage, but part of the black flames appeared on his legs as well.

"I need the blood; I need to get a direct hit; I can't just wear him down!" Chris pushed himself off a Qi platform and spun his body.

He was going in an attempt to rip off Unzoku's flesh, but in annoyance of not being able to hit Chris from before, he lifted his head and let out a large howl, "AWHOOO!" Following the howl, swirling red energy pulsed out of Unzoku's body. As it hit Chris, it caused him to be pushed back, and his whole body skidded across the ground, tearing it up.

"All of this is just from the external energy from his body. Even after consuming Shinto, I'm still no match at all for him, in terms of power!"

The moment the energy blast was no longer affecting Chris, he got up from the ground and tried again.

After Unzoku expended all of his energy out, he looked at the black flames that were spreading. Since his energy wasn't doing anything to get rid of them, there was only one thing he could do. With the sharp claws of his hand, he cut off parts of his flesh along with the fur and threw it onto the ground.

The black flames stayed on the pieces of flesh, but in the place of the wounds that were on Unzoku's body, they had started to heal.

Immediately after seeing this, Chris started to swing his claws rapidly, trying to hit Unzoku, and changed direction from one side to the other. Unzoku was avoiding the annoying hits and moved to the side, back and away. VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

That's when the demon king realized something, though. Chris hadn't gone after him; he wasn't rushing toward him. Instead, he was moving into the area where Unzoku had been not too long ago.

As he rushed past the area Unzoku was before, he picked up the flesh and clenched it with his hand, getting rid of the flames. Then he looked for where Calva was along with Pultra.

With his arm, he threw the piece of flesh in the air. It was going at an incredibly fast speed, but Calva, creating a bone out of his hand, stabbed it as it was in the air.

"This is‚Ä¶ this is Unzoku's flesh," Pultra said with disbelief.

The flesh was stuck on the bone spear that Calva had made, and blood was dripping down it. Almost immediately, Pultra pulled out one of the flasks she had been given by the others, and the two started to strain the blood.

"Did Chris plan all of this after getting the power of the black flames?" Pultra thought.

In no way or form would anyone say that Chris would be able to defeat Unzoku. Even with the power of Shinto, it could be seen. Unzoku's body had healed so quickly after cutting off his own flesh, and his power was overwhelming.

Even though Chris was able to annoy Unzoku like a little fly, eventually, he would be squatted and overwhelmed, but the demon kings and even Immortui, had no idea that their goal was just the blood, and they had now achieved that.

With Tenbris being a part of Unzoku, the group had managed to get all five of the demon king's blood. The question was, now how would they get out of this situation.

"You are starting to look even more delicious," Unzoku licked his lips.
