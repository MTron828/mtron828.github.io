The clones Quinn created were unable to use many of the active skills that the god slayer armour possessed, and it was one of the many reasons why the fight that was going on against the demon king was incredibly different compared to before. 

Kronker was being slammed with all sorts of different fists, they all looked slightly different from each other, though some were the same. Luckily for him, he could tell next to no difference between these fists because his durable red hard crystal body was taking in everything.

'He's broken my hard outer shell crystal before, which means he will be able to do it again. I'm not sure how much longer my body can last.' 

Kronker was hearing strange noises he had never heard before as the fists hit the outside of his armour. At the same time, the strikes were producing this strange electrifying power. Although the crystals were able to nullify most of it, he could feel a tingling sensation inside. 

'If my body breaks down from this, then I'll die. I can't lose the fight like this.'

Due to the constant hits, it was hard for him to move, even trying to make an attack of his own, his arm was being hit back before he could do anything, so there was only one way he could break this cycle. While being constantly hit, the energy around the demon king, the energy that was high up in the skies, started to move again. 

'This can't be it.' Quinn thought, as he relentlessly continued to swing his arms. Due to the limitless armour set ability, he didn't tire, and if he had to continue to attack this way, for several days, to defeat the demon king he could do it, but there was something nagging him at the back of his mind.

'These demon kings are said to only be a little less in strength compared to Immortui. I was expecting a harder battle, when I went against Ray, it was harder than this, there has to be something else, something else other than just its hard shell!' Quinn thought. 

The energy in the sky started to form on the back of Kronker. Then as the crystals expanded on his back, they all broke into small glitter. It was the same as he had done when using his fist from before, but the crystals on his back were more plentiful. 

Moving to the side away from the fists that were coming towards him, now this pink glitter was coming towards Quinn like they were two large tornadoes. 

The clones that were helping with the attacks towards the body of Kronker, decided to concentrate on the tornado of pink crystals. They continued to swing their fists, hitting the shards with a strong powerful blood aura. 

When the fists hit the crystals, it broke them up, and bits could be seen coming off from the large tornado, but the shards that had fallen off, would rejoin the tornado of shards that were coming towards them.

'A troublesome attack that I can't get rid of too easily.' Quinn thought. 'If I'm going up against something named a demon king, then it should at least be this troublesome.'

Four of his hands continued the barrage, and now it wasn't enough to keep Kronker in the air, his body was starting to fall slightly as the power wasn't enough but he was still falling down slowly. With two of his hands, Quinn started to gather the shadow around them. 

It was a solid dark purple, close to black, in colour, he then pressed it on the two clones that were by his side. The shadow surrounded their body, and touched the shadow that was covering their bodies. 

Letting go of them, shadow was no longer covering his arms and instead both of the clones had complete shadow bodies, from head to toe. No one would even be able to tell that they were clones of Quinn now. 

'The biggest issue with the clones was the fact that their bodies are weak. If they are hit in the slightest they puff into a cloud of smoke, but with this, they can overcome that weakness a bit.' Quinn thought, as he looked straight ahead.

The best way to take down this demon king was to attack it directly like he had been doing the first few times. Quinn stopped his barrage of punches as he jumped from the ground running through the air, while the two clones went off to the side, to the tornado of shards.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The fight had gone from the ground to a battle that was mid air, and that's when Anon decided to take the opportunity. He had rushed on the ground, and not far behind him were the recent two allies he had made. They stayed with him because the two of them felt like it was only because of Anon that they were still alive. 

They just seemed to have more of a stroke of luck staying with Anon, but even then they were hesitant. All three of them could feel from the energy coming off from the fight, that the area was heavy. Just walking near the fight was quite damaging to them, to the point where all three of the Skullys had to transform themselves so more of their exoskeleton bone was out on display. I think you should take a look at

With the goal in front of him though, Anon had eventually reached the champion, standing there chained up on his two feet, looking at the fight ahead and ignoring the newcomers that had arrived. 

"Champion Calva!" Anon shouted at the top of his lungs, not staring away from Calva's eyes. 

Hearing his own name, he turned his head, and was relatively surprised to see three Skullys in front of him. If he was in their shoes and had as much power as they did, he wouldn't have stepped foot on the battlefield, there was a good chance that they wouldn't make it back depending on how the fight went.

"For more years than we can remember, this world has been ruled by Immortui and his Demon kings. In the past, you, along with the other champions, fought and lost. Although the world was not a good place before and was filled with death back then, at least it was of our own accord. 

"At least we weren't forced into situations that we didn't agree with. Back then, when Immortui came, we fought against him separately, and there's a lot of regret with all of us inhabitants. 

"I'm sure you thought about it a lot back then as well. What would have happened if we were to fight them all together. We thought it was too late, and could only live with this regret, but now after all this time, there is an opportunity, there is someone that can go against the Demon kings, there is a chance that we can get rid of Immortui as well as the regret that we all have from back then!"

The words spoken by Anon were powerful and they truly were how many of the Skullys felt. His way with words was what convinced Tuni and Ekeke to team up with him. 

If Anon was unable to convince the champion then who could?

"I see… so are you here to make a deal? To free me, as long as I agree to work together in taking down Immortui?" Calva asked. The old him would have never thought of doing such a thing. 

But after seeing the pile of corpses he was curious and wondered how much the world had changed. In Calva's mind, there was killing people because they were annoying, because they challenged one, or as a reason to prove oneself. In his head all of these were a valid reason. 

However, killing for fun wasn't something that he could understand. Yet he was also realistic with himself. He wasn't great working with others, they would do things that annoyed him and in turn he would wish to get rid of them. 

The reality was though he wasn't strong enough to take on Immortui.

"Do you guys even know who you are helping though?" Calva asked. "Because, the one that is fighting the demon king at the moment, is a demon himself. So let me ask you, do you want me to help a demon, or do you want me to get rid of them both."
