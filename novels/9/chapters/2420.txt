The demon form of Quinn had come to an end, and he himself knew that due to a few reasons, one of them being the system screen which had popped up in front of him. 

[The demon energy in you has settled]

[Error, Error]

Red screens appeared in front of him with an alarm ringing in his head a couple of times. It had been a long time since the system had acted this way. With Quinn having evolved beyond what the system could do for him, or improve, there wasn't much use for it anymore. 

The most effective thing was just its sorting of information, such as his inspect skill, and also knowing when his cool downs ended, or health and other stats were to be used. However, things like his skills, he stopped using the system to activate the skills long ago. 

Now he could do all of his skills naturally with his body, and there were even things he could do outside of the system with his shadow and blood aura for example.

'The system has strangely been giving me a few quests since I have interacted with others and entered this new world. It is one that is meant to continually adapt. Which makes me wonder what this error is.' 

Thankfully, the system had somewhat explained what the error was. 

[Additional information has been blocked]

[You are unable to access system messages, while in your current form.]

[Please transform into your demon form to access new messages.]

After reading the message there were a few raised eyebrows from Quinn. What could the messages even be that his system was unable to show him. On top of that, how would it even be possible for him to do so? 

Quinn was able to willingly go into the demon form, but when he did he would lose consciousness. He was not in control of his own body, and he wasn't even able to remember what had occurred. 

However, this time it was a little different, although Quinn was still in able to control himself, memories were rushing to him, memories of what he had done. He wasn't proud of what had happened by any means. 

Quinn took a deep breath as he remembered some of the events. 

'You have to stay strong, you have to remember why you are doing this in the first place. Remember how many have already died that you know and care about, that you were unable to save' Quinn said to himself. 

He was reassuring himself that he was doing the right thing, and even had to tell himself that those Skullys would have been dead anyway by the strange hunting game that they were playing, even if he hadn't killed them with his own hands. 

A part of him was a little worried, and wondered if it was easy for him to disregard these things, due to the time he had spent as a celestial when his feelings were a lot more numb than they were now.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

'If the system is saying that there are messages in my demon form, then it also must mean there's a way to control the form, and I have to think, what was different this time, compared to last time.

'Why can I remember what happened last time? Either way, I'm going to have to put a pin in it for the time being.' 

The system still had a few more messages for him that he was able to read.

[You are unable to transform into your demon form]

[A notification will be received once you have sufficient energy to transform again.]

This was also a first for Quinn from the system. In the past when he had tested out the demon form, no such message had come up, and truthfully he could have just gone back into the demon form again. 

Although transforming did take up a lot of his energy, he couldn't imagine himself repeatedly transforming again and again. 

'Is it because this time I actually had someone to fight. Because I used a lot of my powers, but this isn't good, this isn't good at all.' Quinn thought. 'The system has no way to tell me how long it will be, and since I can't access the system while in demon form, I don't even know how long I have in that form… maybe that's the answer after all. The system is pointing me to try to control my demon form.' 

Quinn didn't think this was a bad idea, after all he knew its strength. It was what he was forced to use when going up against the Behemoth, and it had allowed him to defeat the demon king this time as well. 

It wasn't that Quinn thought he wouldn't have been able to defeat the demon king without, but truthfully it was hard for him to gauge Kronker's power after he had transformed, since he had done so as well. 

'I also need to figure out what happened to me, why did my body forcefully transform, right after the demon king did. It happened when the energy hit me, will this happen every time I face a demon king, and what if I was to go up against Immortui, would it happen then as well.'

There was something fearful about fighting without one's mind. Although Quinn thought the demon form was incredibly strong, when not in control, it felt like he was trusting someone else to do the job and after all this time of completing everything himself, he felt like he could only trust his true self to get this job done. 

'Either way, now I know this world can affect me in different ways. It's a good thing that I didn't bring any of the others with me. If they had come, especially during that demon form and I was to do harm to them, I don't know what I would have done.' Quinn thought.

While thinking about all of this, something did click in Quinn's head. 

'Wait, the system is giving me more information than it ever did before about any of this, with the memories and the quest, all of this goes hand in hand. Of course, why didn't I see it before.'

The fact that his body had been influenced by the demon energy, forcing him to turn, was the key for him figuring it out. 

'Since it had been so long since the system had given me a proper quest I almost forgot.' Quinn thought. 'A quest is just that, a quest! At the end of the quest there is a reward. 

'Just like the quest to absorb the five great demon generals, it improves my blood power and strength. Which means, absorbing the blood of the demon kings will also bring a reward. 

'One of these things is most likely able to control the demon form. That's why the system is now telling me more than before. That's why, I was able to remember what happened this time, because I had already absorbed the blood of one, my body is already experiencing changes.' 

Thinking about all of this, for a moment Quinn wondered whether or not he should change his plan slightly. In his original plan, he only wished to go after Immortui and take care of him. Whatever came in his way, he would deal with it. 

If he could get the blood upgrade before facing Immortui, it was a bonus. However, after his fight with the demon king, there was a good chance that Immortui could force him to change his form as well, so wouldn't it be better for him to complete the quest first?

'I would be wasting time though, and who knows what is happening back home.' 

Saying was also easier than doing, because how would he even find these other demon kings? The first one he had completely ran into by chance. It was the same for his plan to look for Immortui.

Clearing the system screens from his view as well as the errors wasn't the end of the messages, and perhaps the last ones he read were the most devastating. 

[Your armour set has been severely damaged]

[Passive effect is currently in progress]

[A notification will appear when the armour set has been repaired.]

Before when Quinn turned into the demon form, because he knew he was doing it, he would place his armour in the shadow, just so nothing would happen. This time, due to it being a forced transformation, his armour was ruined in the process. 

Thankfully, there was a passive skill, no matter how damaged the armour would get, it would eventually repair itself until it was back to its original form. They were items worthy of being called god-slayer tier.

What it did mean was he would have to be without it. 

'Again, the system is giving me no timer, just how stingy has this system gotten?' Quinn complained.

It was the end of the system messages there, and at least he had to be thankful for it in the end. Without it, he probably wouldn't know what to do.

'I guess first I have to deal with the situation in front of me.' Quinn lifted his head, looking up at the Champion and the Skully's coming out from behind him.
