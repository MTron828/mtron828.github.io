Chapter 1219 Crash Landing

While Vincent was in Quinn's body, using the shadow abilities still felt very foreign to him. He could use the blood skills in Quinn's body without having to rely on the system because he had used these skills and the same moves in his body a long time ago, again and again.

At the same time, Quinn's body, due to it having evolved into the Vampire lord stage, wasn't actually all that different to what Vincent had in the past. But the shadow abilities were a different matter altogether. To use them, Vincent had to access the system. When using the shadow link skill, it gave him a few options of people he could connect to that also had their shadow link on.

'There are a couple on the Cursed ship that have the Shadow ability, but the question is who should I go towards?' Vincent wondered. 'There was that strong blockhead fighter, Nate? No, in this situation there is a high chance he is still in the middle of combat. What I need to gather first is information. I have no clue what has happened on the Cursed ship nor why the fighting has prolonged for this long. The one I need to go to is Sam.'

After making his decision, Vincent soon found his body becoming a shadow itself. When his body was forming back to its solid state, he could see himself appearing in front of Sam, but the sight wasn't exactly what he thought it would be.

When seeing Sam, he looked partially injured. Blood was dripping from his head and was all over his clothes. That wasn't the shocking thing though, what was shocking about the situation was where they were currently. From staring out of the square window in the room, Vincent could see they were around three stories high in some type of building. The walls were made of a hard orange brick of some sort.

In the room itself, he wasn't alone. Layla and Nate were conscious but lying on the floor. It seemed like they were unable to move as they would constantly whine and groan in pain, and lastly, the two reporters Bonny and Void, were present as well.

"Quinn! You're here!" Bonny shouted as she was the first one to spot them. Void, who was by her side, quickly grabbed her and reminded her that she needed to be quiet, making a shushing sound. Sam, who was constantly peeping out of the large window, not seeing anything, smiled when he turned and saw who it was, but that smile quickly faded.

"Quinn, your back. I couldn't get in contact with you before, so I thought something serious had happened to you, but you look fine." Sam spoke quietly.

"What happened here? Why aren't you on the Cursed ship?" Vincent asked, thinking that the current situation was far more critical than telling his own story. Where were the rest of the Cursed members? Why were they on the planet? The last time they had watched the live stream, they could see that they were still on the ship. So much had clearly changed.

Glancing over to Void, Vincent could see that he was still working away, and it looked like the live stream was still being broadcasted.

Sam didn't say much at first. But he poked his head out of the window carefully again. Seeing how cautious his actions were, Vincent was doing the same. Also, with his careful hearing, he could hear that there was still fighting going on in, but it was a distance away.

"If you look out far enough, I think you will be able to spot it. That's the Cursed ship over there." Sam pointed.

Looking out the window, Vincent could see that the cursed ship was stuck in the sand. It didn't look like it had received the best of landings as pieces were handing off. Now he realised that they were on a planet.

"It's quite a story, I don't know if you know, but the Blade family attacked us, and they didn't come alone, but they had also unleashed all the captives they held on us as well. But where things started to change was when the Dalki arrived. I'll catch you up as much as I can‚Ä¶"

When the attacks from the Blade family ship had stopped. It gave Logan more time to figure out the situation on the ship. He was using his spiders and the cameras onboard to see everything that was going on, but what also turned out to be a good source of information for himself was the live stream that was coming from Void.

Although Logan could see everything, he had to remain where he was in the command centre for a few reasons. He was using his soul weapon to repair any structures that were needed on the ship. With the most powerful ability users fighting against each other, there were sure to be holes here and there that would lead to severe problems if left unattended.R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at n√¥(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As quickly as they were being made, he was fixing them, but he couldn't do that forever. At the same time, he kept the fighting on the ship to certain areas. Opening and closing off certain areas, making it so all of those would choose to go a certain way around the ship, but there were a few people he couldn't control, and that was the Blade family themselves.

'If they start fighting with their full strength, I don't think my MC cells can keep up. I have to do something.'

Using his calculations, Logan ultimately made a choice to head towards Planet Caladi. The desert planet that was closest. The only thing was while he was on his way there, he had run into a certain Dalki mothership hovering nearby, and they didn't exactly look like they were just going to let them land.

In a quick split decision, seeing the chaos and struggle everyone was facing and hoping to cause even less harm, Logan allowed them to purposely board the ship. It was a risk, but he had hoped that the fighting that was happening between humans at the moment would soon be concentrated on the third enemy that was coming towards them, the only thing he didn't calculate was just who would be coming onboard the ship, and that was a five spiked Dalki.

They had yet to run into one, so why of all things was there one in a place like so next to a planet like so. The only thing he could think was that the Cursed faction was genuinely cursed.

The fighting between the Dalki and Hilston was already causing trouble for Logan. All of the training rooms were reinforced, but with two titans, the damage and attacks were unable to be contained, and as the fight went on, they both started to use more of their strength. If they continued to fight then, Logan could see half of the ship disappearing and all of them dying on the spot.

'I got reports that the teleporters on the ship aren't working anymore, ever since the Dalki came on board. Only a few people managed to use them to escape in time. Damn it, we need to get there quicker!'

Heading towards the planet, Logan knew he would have to put more energy into the thrusters and break through the atmosphere. Calculating it with the planet's gravity pulling them in, it was going to be a rough landing for all of them.

[Everyone, this is Logan. Brace for impact, we are approaching planet Caladi at an incredible speed. We will Crash!]

The message ended there, and it didn't take long for everyone on board the ship to feel just what was happening. Logan could see the giant ship heading straight towards a sandy desert not too far away from the Shelter.

He was doing his best to slow it down, changing the ship's shape using his ability to make it more wind resistant. Parts of the ship were breaking off and flying, the front was getting incredibly hot, but he knew they all needed to pull through.

Lifting the ship up at the right moment, the large Cursed ship started to skim across the sand. Crashing and bouncing more than once. Waves of sand were chucked up in the sky each time, everywhere, and the sudden impact sent those that were fighting inside off their feet.

Even Logan himself was unable to keep his hands on the command centre. When it finally stopped, Logan pulled himself up. He noticed that the ship was still in good condition. They would still be able to fly. With a few weeks of work, they could get it back into top shape in no time, bringing it back to what it originally was.

'There's one thing I need to do.' Logan thought, placing his hands on the command console one last time. All of the exits for a crash landing in such a situation like this one were now opening. Parts of the outer layer of the armour were ejected from the main ship, and several exits were seen all over. Allowing for everyone inside to exit from the ship.

There were around a 1000 Cursed members aboard. The ship could hold more, but some had already left, and there were those that had left when the Cursed revealed themselves as V.

Immediately, people started to leave the Cursed ship, but they weren't the only thing that were leaving. As Dalki could be seen continuing to fight, not taking a break.

A few seconds later, and a large explosion was heard coming from the centre of the ship, and in the air, Hilston could be seen having been grabbed by a Dalki with its feet by his shoulders and was thrown far off into the sand.

Exiting out of the Cursed ship as well, Sam was trying to act as quickly as possible. Many of the chained were in combat with the Dalki, but his priority was not getting rid of the Dalki, but getting everyone to a safe place. With the Shelter nearby, he just wanted all of the others to get away from the fighting that was about to occur. So he had made that his target. Telling everyone to go towards the Shelter while letting the Chained fight the Dalki.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Back in the room, Sam had just gotten to this part of the story.

"I know it might have been wrong to abandon the others, but I needed to look out for the Cursed faction most of all. Still, all of this was my mistake. I should have remembered that planet Caladi was one of the first planets evacuated by the Earthborn group. When everyone arrived at the Shelter, it had already been taken over by a group of Dalki. The fight wasn't over even for us."
