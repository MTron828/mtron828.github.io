Chapter 2368 Journey To Another World

The familiar sound of metal clashing against rocks, as hammers hammered away, was music to Alex's ears. He had a big grin on his face as he had entered the forgery used by the vampires.

It was a large dark cave with furnaces, moulds, and more. It wasn't as impressive as what the Amra had, but it was still good enough for him to work with. When entering, immediately Alex caught the attention of the other vampires, they were unable to stop staring and as some saw who it was, they gave a quick bow.

'Oh right, they must all think I'm Muka, she did say to cover my face while I was working away.' Alex thought to himself, pulling out a black scarf and wrapping it around his face just showing his eyes.

It was pretty pointless since the others had already seen him, but since he was wearing some type of disguise, they thought they weren't meant to comment on it. The fact that Muka was here was strange enough.

After taking his own station, Alex pulled out the crystal and laid it out on the table. He was observing the outside.

'These god slayer crystals are always so interesting, each one of them looking quite different.' Alex thought.Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

He was running his finger over the strange scales that were attached to the outside. It almost looked like clumps of dirt had attached itself to the crystal, but on inspection they were a part of the crystal itself, like the scales of a Dalki.

'This will be the first god slayer crystal I'm working with from a Dalki, it makes me wonder what will come out of it. With my experience working with god slayer crystals before, it shouldn't take too long.'

Holding the crystal to his chest, there was a giant smile on his face.

'Finally, after all this time, I'll be able to make something again with my own two hands. This will be my own masterpiece rather than one created through Quinn's hands.'

He started to think back to the items he had forged with Quinn, how skillful he was using the hammer, how strong his body was, and how he didn't tire. In a way, it was quite annoying because Quinn had the skills to be an excellent forger, maybe even surpassing Alex.

Shaking his head away though, he was determined to make this the best piece he could now that he could forge himself again.

‚Äî‚Äî-

"What is there to talk about?" Russ asked, sitting down in a sofa seat while the rest remained standing. "Didn't you already give us the low down on everything we need to know. We just have to survive, find Quinn, then help him take down this death god, right?"

On the way to the settlement each one of them had been filled in on the information of why this task was so important. How Immortui was a god from another world, trying to pour in him and his creatures into this one.

The finer details such as him being the creator of the vampires though was somewhat missed out, but all the relevant information that would tell them how important this task was, had been filled in.

"In order to give you the best chance of survival, we have gathered as much information as we can." Muka said. "Logan has gone through all his memory banks, and the information that had been handed to him by Richard Eno, and there was quite extensive research done on this other world.

"At the same time, Peter has been able to gather information from the familiars as well.

"In the other world, there are two types of beings or creatures that we need to look out for." Muka explained. "There are the words natural inhabitants. There are different races like what we have here on Earth, but their appearance does largely differ like that of the familiars.

"These beings naturally have the urge to fight and kill, even more so than the beasts or the Dalki. It is a world full of death and a true survival of the fittest. It is a world that has been given up on due to how much carnage there was, it was deemed out of control by the gods.

"Which is why Immortui was sent there in the first place. Why would they care for a world that had already been abandoned. Perhaps they thought he might even be dealt with in this world, yet that did not happen.

"Instead, Immortui managed to take over the entire world, rising to the very top. The familiars state there now is more order in the world, and there are the new beings called Demons.

"The Demons are creations of Immortui, and there are several different types of demons, different races you could call it, with different traits.

"I'll be honest there is no plan that I can really come up with that will help you, the best I can do is just give you information. There are two scenarios, one, the original inhabitants have a deep hatred for Immortui, or they are working for him.

"I would like you to assume the latter, and imagine everyone is your enemy."

"So all of us in this room are meant to go against an entire universe and a death god, got it!" Russ said. "So our chances of dying are high."

Some would think Russ' words might deter the others but it hadn't, they were already aware of this fact.¬†I think you should take a look at

"If we could, I would send more in to help." Muka said. "But a small team, when only having one real target, is more beneficial and the Boneclaw only has so much power. What you need to be aware of is that the Boneclaw can only transport you into the other world, and has no idea where Quinn is.

"At the same time. They have no idea where he will transfer you. There's a good chance you will be attacked by the others immediately, as you stand out. So be ready."

‚Äî‚Äî

The group were making final preparations, they were training with each other, learning what each other's strengths were. At least most of them were, while Russ was being kept under watch.

Wondering if he would try to run away at any point and time, but they felt he wouldn't do so until he got his item anyway. Then, after a single day, his item was finally done. Everyone was to gather at the ninth castle once again.

They were waiting in the reception room, and entering las was Alex.

"Your item is done!" Alex said, as he chucked over a small object.

It flew in the air and Russ caught it, seeing that it was round in shape.

"A bracelet?" Russ said. "I gave you a crystal from one of the strongest in this universe and you gave me back a bracelet."

"You're quite narrow minded aren't you." Alex said. "Trust me, item types, especially god slayer item type weapons, are extremely powerful."

"I would trust him." Edvard said. "He is the one that made all of Quinn's equipment after all. I have seen the strength of his items first hand, but if you don't want it, you can always hand it to me."

Edvard held his hand out, to which Russ quickly pulled away and placed the black bracelet on. It then started to move, shrinking in size and becoming skin tight.

After inspecting what the bracelet did, his distaste for the item went away, but he couldn't be sure until he used it himself.

"There might be a few other things the bracelet can do, but I didn't want to test it fully. It's not my item at the end of the day, and I don't think I'm strong enough to draw out its power." Alex said.

Now that everyone was ready, fully equipped with what they needed, it was time for them to go.

Peter rubbed the back of his neck, a marking started to glow and soon form a mist, the large Boneclaw appeared in front of them all. It pointed its large dangled finger to the side and started to draw a large circle.

A faint red mark was left in the air and when it joined up, the entire area lit up red. A strong mist was sent out of the portal.

"So this is it, this is the other world." Sil said. "Peter, this reminds me a lot of back then, when we went through the red portal."

Peter shook his head.

"It's different, we're a lot different now to what we were back then, but you're right, we don't know what's on the other side‚Ä¶ but we do know Quinn is there, which is why we need to go, and this time, no one's pushing anyone, we're walking in together."

Saying those final words, all of them walked into the portal, heading to another world.
