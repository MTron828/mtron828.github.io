Urban Oasis
0.00 / 0.00

The plan for the universal alliance among different races had been set out. With communication set up through Stark and Ceril, they had informed the other planets to be ready for whatever it was that would come their way.

Fleets were ready to move out, and in the meantime, each planet was scouting areas out of their usual fly zone in space. An attack would come at some point, but it was impossible to utilise all three armies that lived apart from each other fairly quickly.

At least not unless they had teleporters, which none of the current planets had, and out of all of them there, none of them had the knowledge to build one either. So for now they had to rely on scout ships and then attempt to move as quickly as possible.

The group had decided to stay on the Amra planet for now. They had no news from Wince that Quinn had returned. On top of that, the Amra planet had the strongest level of gravity.

For all of them, including Stark, they thought it was best if they stayed on the planet, as a type of natural training. If they had to fight on the Amra planet it would give them an advantage and Stark felt like he would be able to run even faster than before.

Walking around the place with Minny and Galen, Layla had come across the Blades training. Geo had placed all of the humans in the same area, and had somewhat made a little village for the Blades.

They had been living here for a while, so it made sense, and surprisingly Layla could see that they weren't struggling with the gravity at all. In fact, they were doing some early morning training, and it was more physical than anything.

There were these strange large rocks that looked like giant footballs, and they were throwing them from one another, catching them, and sweating.

"It looks a bit caveman-esk." Russ stated as he appeared by their side.

"How, with your upbringing, did you grow up to be such a snob? Have you ever done any type of physical work in your life?" Layla asked, looking him up and down.

Although Russ had a relatively small frame and just relied on his powers most of the time when fighting, what did surprise her was the fact that he was dealing with the higher gravity better than most.

Galen and Minny who were both watching thought it was quite fun, and they soon ran out ahead picking up one of the heavy rocks. They chucked it to each other as each one of them caught it, and threw it back with relative ease.

The Blades that were sweating and tired couldn't believe their eyes as they watched two kids, doing the task so easily.

"Remember they are not like us." Shiro shouted. "It would be best that you don't compare yourselves to them. I bet they would even give most vampires a run for their money."

Approaching Shiro as he was taking a break, Layla wanted to ask him a few questions, as she had noticed a few things while they were training.

"All of you have gotten physically much stronger, and the Qi in your body, I can feel it, there is a larger amount of it compared to before, how did you improve it so fast?" Layla asked.

Layla herself had a large amount of Qi, there was her own powers and that she had absorbed from her mother, one of the high rankers and founders of Pure. She couldn't be compared to the likes of Chris, Zero, or Quinn but was quite high up there when it came to using her Qi.

After all, thanks to her soul weapon she could even absorb or give Qi to others, as long as her or the other person's body was able to handle it, and it was why she was so sensitive to the power and could see the large improvement.

"This, right now, is just a warm up for us, before we enter the Tower." Shiro replied.

"The tower?"

"It's what made us grow in strength so fast. Every day we try to reach the next floor. Climb higher than we did before and experience a bigger breakthrough. Some of the floors gravity is even stronger than what is here." Shiro explained.

The tower certainly had piqued Layla's interest. She was once the leader of the Red vampires and the power of the sword did her well. Yet, still there would be those that could harm her children even with her being there.

She knew there was more power to the sword, it was her body that was unable to take the full power of the weapon. That's why she had been so hurt last time, but if she could improve her body, to allow her to take more of the sword's power for a longer amount of time, then maybe she could be more useful in the upcoming fights.please visit

" Let's see this tower, maybe I can come along."

After a nice rest everyone started to head to the tower, Stark, Ceril and Russ had heard quite a few people talking about it, and had done their own research. In turn they all had their own reasons for wanting to climb it.

Some wishing to improve themselves, to be more useful, and some wishing to obtain what was on the top floor.

"It looks like there's more of you." Geo said, standing at the front with a big smile. "I will try my best to protect you in the tower, but please be careful, the more there are of you, the harder it will be."

In particular Geo was looking at the two children, but Layla didn't want them to be away from her, and knew that they were both strong.

"Very well." Geo said as they all went to enter the tower, wishing to come out as new people.

A few hours after the others had entered a tower, one of the Amra scout ships had caught the attention of a ship attempting to land.

"Please state who you are and the reason for you coming here." The Amra asked.

"We are humans, and we are here on behalf of Logan Green."

There was silence for a moment as the Amra were deciding what to do. They didn't know of this Logan Green, and the only humans they could contact to see if they knew these two were in the tower.

In the end, Dober had to make a decision, and asked them a few questions before determining that they were here for valid reasons. Eventually, Dober along with the two humans that arrived were taken to the tower.

"Those that you wish to deliver your message to are in the tower. It is a dangerous place though, and who knows what floor they are on. It would be best if you just waited out here for them." Dober explained.

"I think it's okay, I think we can head inside. You don't have to worry about us, we're strong." The young man said as he walked in, with the female by his side. "We should be able to catch up with them fairly quickly."
