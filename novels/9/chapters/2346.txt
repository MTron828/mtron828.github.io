The vampires were busy getting into position around the metal-like arena, while a few of them seemed to be doing a few last minute adjustments to the machines around it. Jessica wondered why they even needed all of these things in the first place to do what they were going to do.

'They will be here‚Ä¶ they will protect me, they will stop that bad dream from happening. I have to believe in them, I have to believe in Quinn, right?' Jessica thought. Even though Quinn himself wasn't involved, he had ordered the others to look over her, at least that's what she thought.

While all the vampires were gathering, she could already feel the energy rising, and she looked at them. Some of them she had recognised, vampire groups that had already started to make a name for themselves as Travellers.

Some that looked to have the clothes and armour of those living in the settlement. Even vampires that had done great acts in the past but had claimed to now be retired. Last, she even saw a large number of them wearing the Vampire Corps uniform.

There were those she didn't recognise, most likely from different departments, but then she could see captains and squad leaders that even though they weren't in her department, she had met them once or twice through meetings.

'These were all in the ships from before that were coming to the island, it was all of these people working on this project. Immortui has been able to infiltrate the vampire population strongly.'

Her eyes were glued to one person, and she wanted to shake her head, but she was unable to, due to the strange effects of the pill.

'No, no, not you too, how did he get to you, when did he get to you!' Jessica screamed in her head.

As she saw Barbra, the chief of her own Vampire Corps base standing in the large circle staring straight ahead. It made her think that there was possibly no escape. If Magnus had failed in capturing her, then one of the people she believed in, one of the people she had trusted would have found a way for her to get in Immortui's hands.

Seeing Barbra like so, it had taken all of the hope out of her.

'If even someone like her can be controlled, someone so close to me, then all of this will just continue, even after Magnus‚Ä¶ I have no one anymore.'

The machine has been turned on, and the symbols on the ground started to light up. As they did, the vampires were covered in their red aura from head to toe.

Jessica's heart was thumping louder and faster than before. Her whole body felt like it was on fire. Just like the vampires, her own aura was now covering her on the outside. From head to toe she was covered in yellow aura.

'It's only a matter of time now.' Magnus thought.

-----

The other's were already on a spaceship heading toward the island. They were going there as fast as they could, now they knew where Jessica and Magnus were, and they had heard everything. Unfortunately, it was as Quinn feared.

Jessica was a key to open up a portal to another world.

"From what we heard, it appears that this facility must have been built on another weak point. Where the separation between the two worlds is weaker." Agent 4 was explaining. "Immortui needs to channel the energy in some way, so they have created a device that will help accelerate the power, as well as crafting a more permanent magic circle."

Everyone was listening intently, they now had a few more people who were onboard and helping out with this task. Agent 4, Logan, just in case he was needed, and Andy had asked to be taken along, now that he knew the truth of the matter.

"This is not your fault Quinn." Logan said, seeing the look on his face. "We had no clue where these weak points were, nor what Magnus needed to do with Jessica. You have to think about it as well, do you really think that Magnus just marked all of those vampires just now?

"That he managed to build a facility in just a week or so? No, most likely he had all of these marked for a long time. Immortui is that type of person, he is determined to get out of where he is. All of this had to have been planned for a long time now, we are just realising his actions now."

Hearing Logan speak, Quinn looked directly at Agent 4 who had caught his eye as well, and the both of them smiled while Agent 4 gave him a little nod, confirming that he still remembered what the two had talked about.

"There is still another thing." Agent 4 stated. "This island and facility might have a number of different protections that have been put up. Things that we have never seen before. Firstly, Magnus and his poison, and secondly the use of Magic.

"Magic is something that we hardly understand, even myself. I have only done research into magic circles. The circles, as stated before, with the symbols are like a code, it's almost as if you are running a program, telling the circle what to do with the energy source.

"There is already this mirage that Jessica spoke of, that we will need to deal with."

The group was tense, but to them the threat of magic couldn't be too strong. After all, they used vampire aura and had faced countless people with different abilities. How much different could magic be compared to that?

The ship could see the island in sight and Logan did a quick scan. HIs device was unable to detect any sign of life at all on the island. However, the tracker clearly stated that Jessica was here, at least it was the last place that she was at.

"What's the plan?" Andy asked. "Are we going to go on the ground and try sneak in. Or somehow try to break this magic barrier."

Using his shadow powers Quinn had passed through the ship and was now standing at the very top.

"We don't know how long we have, or what will happen to Jessica after this, we don't have time to be worrying about a magic barrier!"

Quinn lifted both of his hands up, and his eyes started to glow red. In the air, right above the entire island, particles of red aura were gathering. They were forming into a particular shape. As he was gathering his aura, he started to think of all that he had failed.

All that he had let die due to Immortui and Magnus's doing, he couldn't let Jessica die, he couldn't let Immortui get his way.

"Is that a giant blood sword?" Hikel asked.

"I guess, we're not going with sneaking in."

Swinging his hands down, Quinn unleashed the giant blood sword right where the signal from Jessica's transceiver currently was.
