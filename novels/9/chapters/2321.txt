The confused look on both of the Originals faces continued. They went on and discussed big events that had occurred during their time, and while doing so, they both reminded each other of some things.

It was a hard conversation to follow, because Quinn didn't have a lot of context to go by. He continued to listen, and they started to think that maybe they had some memories removed, either that or the two of them were just old, which was also true.

In the middle of their conversation, while they were reminiscing about old times that Quinn didn't really care about, he started to think back himself, about the dhampirs.

'I remember it‚Ä¶ it was when I first created Erin. I didn't even know dhampirs were a thing, but as soon as she was made, there was an attempt to kill her. It was made clear that I was never meant to let anyone know about it.

'Of course, then the whole dhampir vs human mess started, but I found out later that it's possible that Erin, she might have not even been a true dhampir.'

The dhampir that Quinn had created was from his blood, it was a subclass, one that was extremely rare and next to never be seen. Then there were also the dhampirs that could be turned by another, those like Erin.

Lastly, there were dhampirs that came from a vampire and human birth.

"I'm sorry Quinn, but me and Hikel have gone over it, and neither of us can remember any large event like that happening." Edvard replied.

"That's really strange, because when one of my friends became a sub class I was told to keep it a secret. Later I learned a story about how a dhampir was the natural enemy of vampires‚Ä¶ but I can't remember who told me that, whether it was Vincent, Arthur, or Richard.

"Regardless, I did always hear a few things, that vampires in the past would always get rid of what they were afraid of. That's why they exterminated the werewolves, and that's why the dhampirs were an existence that couldn't exist. Since they were superior to vampires."

Both Edvard and Hikel both looked at the ground, as if they were extremely guilty of something. It was clear something Quinn had said upset them.

"I think what you say might be right." Edvard said. "In fact, what we were discussing before, wasn't whether or not dhampirs were dangerous but if there was ever a grand event with the dhampirs. You see, with the werewolves there was an event and a reason why we needed to get rid of them.

"I won't go into the details now, but what is strange is we never had an event that had occured with the dhampirs, like you said, yet we both have heard the same thing, that the dhampirs are an extremely dangerous sub race."

Quinn tried to dive deep into his memory bank, he started to remember a few things. For one, Vincent was chased because he had killed one of the other leaders, but his reason for doing so was due to him trying to create a dhampir.

The leader had gone one step too far when trying to use Vincent's love interest. So at least during Vincent's time it was already well known that dhampirs were dangerous.

"Maybe the event had occurred while both of you were in a slumber?" Quinn said.

"No, because we knew about it before we went into a slumber, but we really don't think anything had happened. It's strange as you said." Hikel commented. "It was well known throughout the settlement. From the looks of things, did someone just spread that around as a rumour."

Rumours or not, the dhampirs, even if it wasn't a true dhampir, did cause a lot of trouble.

Edvard folded his arms, and had a smug look on his face as if he had figured everything out.

"If that's the case, and it really was just a rumour that had been spread around, then I am 90 percent sure I know the person who spread it."

Both Quinn and Hikel moved in closer waiting to hear the answer. Out of all three of them they felt like Edvard would have been the last person to guess.

"It's Richard!" Edvard stated. "Richard Eno. If it came from him, then everyone would have believed it instantly without having to ask for proof. From the beginning he was always one that knew a lot more compared to others.

"Think about it, if you had heard this from any other leader, you would have probably just shrugged it off, or maybe even waited until you confirmed the fact with your own two eyes, but I can imagine it now, if it came from Richard's mouth we would have all just believed it."

What Edvard said made a lot of sense to Hikel, he could even imagine it now. Quinn also felt the same way, for as little as he knew Richard, he tended to believe him more than he didn't. He had great knowledge after all.

"But then why?" Quinn asked. "Why would Richard say such a thing, did he experience something with dhampirs that no one else did. Or after finding a dhampir, he just realised how much of a threat they could be in the future."

They all sat in silence thinking about it more, until Hikel spoke up.

"I doubt that because those types of things, if it was of that nature, wouldn't have been kept hidden, or we would at least know some details. A good example is actually the blood fairies.

"Their existence was welcomed even with the downsides towards us, it was only later after a problem occurred, that they were a banned sub class, and usually it's because of other vampires trying to misuse them, rather than a problem with the race itself."

The words from Hikel, it had given him a hint, a hint to the answer they were probably looking for.

"What you just said, it wasn't usually the race itself that was the problem but how one would use the race. What if all of our guesses are right? Richard Eno, discovered something that a dhampir could do.

"In order to stop someone from abusing its power, he straight up banned them. Maybe the rumours about a dhampir were made up. Of course he would have thought someone would want to harness their power, so there might be another reason, another use of the dhampirs that we don't know about, as for the reason why he made up that rumour."

The more Quinn said it out loud the more he thought he was right. For one thing, this information should have been available to Logan as well, but what if it wasn't. What if it was something so big, that Richard wished to hide it even from him.

"But wait, wasn't there a case where there were multiple dhampirs. We weren't there at the time but we heard about it." Edvard said.

"Yes‚Ä¶but they were different, they weren't like Jessica, a vampire born from a vampire and a human, a true dhampir." Quinn said.

A message had been received from Logan, informing them that Jesscia was indeed on earth.
