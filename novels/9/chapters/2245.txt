Chapter 2246 ¬†Unexpected outcome

Inside the celestial space, sitting in his self-made chair, Mundus was tapping his finger away. He was away from all the other celestials allowing them to continue their tasks. They just went on doing as they usually did, having no idea what was going on.

Because Mundus had been keeping an eye on the situation, he knew what planets the fight would be taking place on. It allowed him to open up several portals, and he was watching everything that was happening in real time.

'I knew these Earthlings would be big trouble, it looks like our guess was right.' Mundus thought. 'After sending a few celestials to deal with them, we realised that they had a few of those with the power of God Slayer. Not only that, but they seem to be progressing at a fast rate.

'Is it due to the wars, due to them pushing themselves so hard?'

When Mundus was talking about this, he wasn't just referring to the Dalki, but the vampires as well. He could see what Jim had been trying to do, creating a situation where only the strongest would survive.

In times of war, there were always those that had to fight and rise to the top just to survive. Everyone had their own story, everyone had their own lives, and there might even be seeds of those growing stronger that no one knew about.

'I did a lot to help you out in this war Quinn, I hope my gamble is going to pay off, and these guys‚Ä¶ just what are they doing? She has always been an outlier, sometimes I feel like she is more trouble than Immortui‚Ä¶ but they don't see it that way I guess. Well, there's nothing we can do about her anyway.'

When looking at the portal, Mundus was looking directly at Sera, the one known as the God of War, who had suddenly decided to join this battle. He had a feeling it wasn't due to his own choice.

Before the invasion had taken place, there were many humans that lived on planets different from earth. One of these places was the Graylash faction. Their memories of events had also been altered, however there wasn't an attempt to convince them to join Jack's side so much.

In the first place, after the first war against the Dalki, the Graylashes had taken a neutral stance. Overcomplicating things and trying to get them to join the war would have been a hard thing to do.

On this planet though, someone who had been travelling for a while now was out on the planet, searching through a thick jungle. They were with a group of travellers.

A large long neck like dinosaur creature was staring at them, they were all in the middle of combat "What is Silk doing! Does he really think he can fight against that thing?" One of the travellers said.

and had been fighting it for a while. Some of them had broken arms, a beast shield had been broken and smashed, but one person at the very back, hadn't been hurt.

"We're screwed, we're all going to die, who knew a demi-god tier beast would be in a place like this!" One of the men said, with his beast weapon shaking in his hand.

The weapon in his hand was only at the advanced tier, and it was struggling to even pierce the skin of its opponent.

"Give me that." One of the travellers at the very back said, as he snatched the sword from his hand.

The traveller looked confused, he had a tight grip on the weapon, yet when it was pulled from his hand it felt like it almost slipped out, and there was no resistance at all. As if the weapon wanted to get into his hand.

"What is Silk doing! Does he really think he can fight against that thing?" One of the travellers said.

"Wait come to think of it, hasn't Silk just been at the back of the group not doing anything?"

With a big puff of air, the traveller known as Silk swung the weapon. Out came an energy blast that went right through the long neck dinosaur's head. It looked almost as if nothing had happened at first, but slowly the top of its head started to fall off.

"How in the‚Ä¶ how is that even possible, I didn't even know the weapon could do that?" The man asked.

"It can't." The man replied. "At least not in your hands. Now all of you, get back and scram out of here. You were just given a second chance at life, so you better treat it well."

The others looked at each other, they were happy to go back after that encounter, and maybe from now on would stop venturing into such dangerous palaces.

"Erghh, excuse me, my sword?" One of the travellers asked.

"What did you say, I just saved your life, and now you're really asking for your sword back!" Silk replied.

The man ignored that his sword had been taken, and turned away with the others with tears down his face, he had saved up his whole fortune to buy that sword and now he wouldn't be coming back with it.

Now the man known as Silk was on his own, deep in the jungle, at least he thought he was.

"Is this really what you thought you would be doing?" A soft voice said.

Turning around, the man could see a woman holding a staff, covered in robes.

"Sera, what are you doing here? You never go into the Celestial space, communicating and making deals with the other celestials, you always stay near Earth?"

"And you care why?" Sera replied. "The only reason why I can guess you are here to speak to me, is because you want something from me."

Bliss clicked her tongue, and gave a smile back, because Sera was right on the mark.

"Aren't you one of the Gods of War? I wonder then, why someone isn't taking part in a war. One who has the strength to empower those that are behind them. One of the best strategists in the battlefield and a person who can use any weapon better than themselves.

"Yet you're here, with travellers fighting Demi-god tier beasts. Why haven't you joined the battle‚Ä¶ and helped the humans at the moment."

During Sera's time here, Jack and Jim had already gone into countless wars against other races. Sera could have fulfilled some of his condition by joining those wars, even if it was as a normal recruit yet he had chosen not to.

"Do Celestials have a sense of right and wrong?" Sera asked. "Or once you become a celestial then do you just end up doing everything you can to fulfil your condition?

"There is a large difference between me and you Bliss. As you said, I am the God of War. I was a celestial that was originally human, and due to all the people that worshipped and prayed to me, I ended up becoming a Celestial.

"Was it the same for you, or were you always a Celestial?" Sera asked.

"That won't change anything." Bliss said. "You know my powers, and I thought I would just come here to inform you of something. Whatever your reason, you have decided to not join this war‚Ä¶ on the humans' side, on Jack's side.

"Maybe it's because you still have an obligation to complete, or you feel guilty for failing the one named Leo. Either way, you have made your choice whether you know it or not.

"There is a big war coming, one of the biggest this universe will have to deal with, and if the outcome of this war is one sided, then there will be a clash, and possible destruction of the universe.

"Now, you can continue hunting and take your time relaxing. I have seen what happens. You decide to eventually act, but by then it's too late, so I'm telling you to act now. When you want to act, contact me, I'll send you to the place that you need to be." Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com

"This is a lot more interesting than I thought." Sera said, standing and looking at Chris and Peter.
