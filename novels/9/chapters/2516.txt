Chapter 2517 ¬†Unzoku a true demon

In the first battle against Immortui, Quinn had been placed in a difficult situation. For one, he had just gone against one of the other demon kings. During his fight, he had been affected by the red mist energy when the other demon king had transformed into its demon form.

Because of this, the armour that Quinn had worn had broken. It left him in an extremely difficult situation as he faced Immortui. As for the second battle, he was a lot more prepared. The armour had recovered itself, giving him more power and versatility in his skills.

He had been learning from the Champions who had faced Immortui before, and even Sil had given him what advice he could from the battle he had with Immortui. Despite all of this, the battle in the end was still lost. He even had the strength of all of the blood that was currently being spilled in the red space. It just went to show how formidable a foe Immortui was.

Unaware of what was happening to Quinn, there were those that were still fighting, with the hope that if they just got him the demon blood he needed, he had a chance at winning; it was all useless now.

For the ones that were fighting, Chris had been in a predicament, where he was faced with a situation where he would have to go up against two demon kings on his own. Thankfully, he had a little support, and that came with the Champions.

With their help, Chris had thought he could do it; he could complete the task and take out Unzoku. But that thought had almost dashed out of his head when he saw what had happened next.

With his large jaw, Unzoku had bitten Tenbris' head off. The Demon King had died in an instant, but Unzoku didn't stop there. He was several times larger than Tenbris, the other demon king, and he continued to eat his body, taking him out in a few bites, crushing his body and swallowing him whole.

"Crap, this is not good!" Shinto shouted. "This is really not good!"

Shinto knew a lot about the werewolves since he had worked with Unzoku in the pits for some time now, so he knew exactly what the result of this would be. Essentially, Unzoku had just eaten a demon king who was at the same level, if not higher, than him; the changes that would be going through his body were immense.

"WHAOOOO!!!!" Unzoku lifted his head, and a deafening scream left his mouth. The whole floor was shaking. The Divine Brigade that were off in the distance, over the rest of the Yak city, were affected by the howl.

They were struggling to fly and disoriented, crashing into buildings and falling onto the ground. It gave a chance for the remaining Yak demons and the werewolves to quickly take out the enemy in front of them.

"What do we do?" Calva asked. "With Tenbris eaten, there's no chance for us to take his blood?"

"Maybe since he consumed Tenbris and his power has been added to his own, wouldn't it be fine if we just got Unzoku's blood?" Shinto replied.

"We don't know how it works, but it's the only thing we can do. But rather than being concerned about whether or not we can get his blood, I think we should be more concerned about whether or not we can survive this!" Pultra shouted.

Chris had the same thought, which was why he was concentrating his power; he was already using the fourth stage of Qi and had backed off further away. He then sprinted forward, using all of the Qi in his body to give himself a run-up.

His claws were low, dragging by his side and cutting the floor up. When in range, Chris lifted both of his claws, unleashing his energy. Through the air, two giant energy claws could be seen crossing each other in an X shape.

Unzoku's eyes were glowing so brightly red it was emitting energy from his eyes even onto the floor. He looked at the claw marks in the air and swung his own large arm.

Instantly, the attack from Unzoku had crushed Chris' attack into nothing. The whole floor was torn to pieces behind them, and all of them were flying through the air, having next to nothing to stand on.

The Yak city had giant markings through it where entire buildings had disappeared. From above, the city looked like it had been scratched with the hand of the giant.

Getting up from one of the building's rubble, quite a distance away from where Unzoku was, the champions were wondering what had happened. They hadn't been hit directly by the attack, so was it just the force alone that had sent them so far.

One by one, they got up from the rubble and looked at each other.

"I'm not sure it's going to be entirely possible to even get his blood," Shinto said. "With the power he just displayed, are we sure that he's any weaker than Immortui right now?"

Even Unzoku was thinking the same thing; he looked at his hand and the destruction he had caused. His face was uncontrollably smiling.

"This is the power I gained from eating the demon kings. It was something I should have done a long time ago. If I had eaten the others, I would have long surpassed Immortui. Maybe, if I eat that other werewolf, I will grow even further to the next stage!"

Back at the destroyed rubble buildings, the champions were trying to look for Chris, and eventually, they found him, a bit further along compared to the others, but that was because he had suffered a direct hit from one of the claws.

Chris had physically pushed back, and as the attack was ripping his body apart, it was trying its best to heal, but as they looked down at him, they could see a large wound right across his chest in a diagonal shape.

He was in a rough shape as the flesh of his muscle could be seen as well, and it looked almost as if Chris was struggling to breathe as well.

"Can you heal him?" Calva asked, looking toward Pultra with her unique ability.

"I can speed up his own healing process, but I don't think it will be fast enough. I'm afraid we are useless in this situation. Perhaps the best thing we can do is take him out of here and attempt to run away."

If Unzoku was that fast, they hated to think how quick he would be as well. Although Pultra suggested running away, it almost sounded like giving up.

"No!" Shinto said. "There is one more option." Shinto walked over to Chris and knelt down by his side. "Eat me... Eat me and get strong enough to defeat him!"
