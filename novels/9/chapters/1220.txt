Chapter 1221 An Awakening

A loud bang went off in the Shelter, and soon after, a building started to collapse, crumbling into pieces falling to the ground. It sounded like a bulldozer had gone full swing, hitting a building, but the sound didn't stop there as the bang was heard again, as another building was hit.

The cause of the noise was due to a mud-like humanoid beast being pushed back, crashing into the buildings. Right now, the beast had created a large shield, and a jet stream of water was pushing against it, not showing any signs of weakening. On initial impact, the strength had sent him through the buildings. Having reached the third building, he had found his footing. His back was up against the wall for support.

'Damn it! This Shelter is horrible for the beast's body to fight in. She has all this open space to use her powers and get away without me getting close!' Raten was complaining. Worst of all, even his mud shield didn't seem to be working out against Vicky's water powers. The strength of a Demi-god tier beast was losing.

Seeing that Raten was in trouble, Vorden soon made his move. He jumped between buildings, using his strong legs to propel himself like a spring, and heading straight for Vicky, who was standing in the middle of the street. Also, in the palm of his hand, a strong orb-like ball of wind was rotating, blue in colour.

The beast had wind powers, and through practice and speaking with Tails, who was inside of his mind, he found out that the wind attacks could actually be contained and controlled. Condensing them several times and holding them all in a ball. Esseintly, it had the power of a tornado but with edges as sharp as a knife.

"I have no choice!" Vorden shouted, throwing out the wind ball towards Vicky, but before it reached her. Pai quickly jumped in the way, and his body could be seen hardening on the spot turning grey like a metal colour.

When the attack hit, the wind strikes enlarged and soon lifted Pai in the air. He was in a round Vortex, with the attacks constantly hitting him, but only faint scratches were made on his body.

"What are you two doing!" Vorden cried out as he could see Raten's Shield turning into a slime mud substance. "There is no reason for us to fight! Shouldn't we be getting rid of the Dalki, or you should be helping Hilston!?"

Vorden never wanted to fight his fellow siblings, who he had grown up with in the castle. He felt like there was even less reason for them to fight now. They had all caught a glimpse of the fight before they had arrived at the Shelter. Perhaps they didn't want to believe it, but they could see. It seemed like Hilston was losing.

As if Vicky could read his mind, she shouted.

"As long as that man is alive, you know we have to do this! Hilston is a man that can never lose, never be beaten!"

Vorden wanted to say more, but being in the same position as herself, he could tell that Pai and her, the fact they were still acting out meant they were too far gone. Almost brainwashed in this belief.

'The jet stream won't stop, and I can't put my shield down, but any longer, and it will melt. It doesn't look like Vorden can do anything against Pai either, not that I expected any help from that weakling in the first place.'

'Let me swap.' A voice said inside of Raten's head.

At first, he thought he was going crazy. Soon he realized that there really was someone else that occupied the same mind as him. Unlike Vorden, Raten hardly communicated with him.

'Yeah right, you couldn't even beat me in a fight. What makes you think you could beat her?' Raten argued back.

'You might be good at fighting hand to hand, but I am better at using my powers. If you die, we both die!' The beast angrily said as it forced Raten out of its body, and the control was now coming from the beast.

The hard mud-like substance that would usually cover the rest of its body started to move and mix in with the mud Shield. Soon it created a large wall combining the two substances. The water continued to hit the wall making its consistency change by the second, but soon the whole wall had collapsed.

Before she knew it, Vicky could see a strange thing heading towards her on the ground. She attempted to use her lightning powers, Zapping it on the floor. Still, the mud creature showed no signs of slowing down, even when being hit.

When the mud creature was close, it formed a spike from itself, heading directly for Vicky. A clanging sound was heard. The one that had stopped the attack was Pai. At the same time, from behind, Pai was holding onto Vicky's hands. The two of them had finally achieved what they had been aiming for.

"Raten, we failed. We have to get out of here!" Vorden shouted, not knowing that the beast was in control. Using his wind abilities, he was quick, but the strange power gathering inside the twins was a stream of water so powerful they would be dead in an instant being hit by that.

It was their signature move when working together. Water powers were also what they had attempted to use to catch them on the island before.

'With both of their abilities combined together. They will be able to destroy anything that touches that water, and it will be too large and quick for us to even run from, so what the hell do we do?' Vorden thought.

Thinking about this and knowing there was no longer enough time to escape. He turned around, trying to plead his case once more.

"Do you really want to kill us? Why does Hilston even want Sil so badly in the first place? Have the two of you ever thought of that? He is so obsessed with getting Sil back he even left his precious island. Do you think any of us ever meant anything to him? Why are you doing this!" The words didn't seem like they were getting through, and even Vorden was just repeating the same things over and over.

"Live your own life, like we have!" Vorden shouted once more.

Raten now back in control. Could see Vorden stupid mistake and quickly ran back.

"I'm sorry, muddy, but if anyone deserves to live, it's this damn softy!" Raten said as he ran towards Vorden, ready to pull him down. Grabbing his shoulder, he pulled him back, risking his own life, that was until. Someone else grabbed both of their shoulders and threw them behind with a strong force that they landed on the ground.

"Borden?" Vorden called out, noticing the familiar facial features but with the Dalki-like features.

"Yep," Borden said with a thumbs up.

Seeing how confident Borden was, Vorden felt like he didn't understand the danger in front of him. The fact that once they joined hands, they were able to use the power of six ability users at once!

"No, even if you take that attack, you'll die! I know your body is strong, but you don't understand their power!" Vorden shouted out desperately.

"Hey, relax before you get a bad throat. I'm not dying today, and I'm not the one dealing with it. There was another person I ran to on the way here." Borden replied. F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Before they knew it, another person was seen falling from above. Their blonde hair floated in the air, and a serious look was on their face.

"Sil?" Vicky called out, noticing the main person they had been looking for this whole time, but Sil showed no regard for who they were.

Instead, he ignored them and, when landing, placed both of his hands on the ground. In an instant, a giant pillar was created beneath them. It had appeared so fast it chucked the two up in the air.

It looked like Sil had used a giant hammer when he had landed to knock the ground beneath them up, but it was just his strong earth abilities that he was using at the moment.

Sil soon started to run, and beneath him, he created a staircase made of earth. Keeping up with his super speed. The whole thing looked impossible to anyone who even had these abilities. Just having such abilities and being able to use them like so were two different things. Reaching the two of them in the air, Sil grabbed both of their arms before they could do anything and, using his strength, pulled them, breaking their hands from each other.

"You guys always make the same mistake, taking the strongest elemental abilities. I learnt something when I lost to Hilston, but the abilities we choose are essential. I can't move as fast as him, my strength isn't as strong as his, so I'll just get an ability that can match him!" Sil shouted, his hands started to glow blue, and the next second, lightning continually struck their body.

The pain was so great it didn't take long for them both to pass out. The ground beneath Sil had now disappeared, and they were falling down out of the sky and quickly to the floor. When they landed, a large bang was heard as he hit the floor, and Sil's legs could be seen covered in a special coating, helping him receive no injuries whatsoever.

Both Raten and Vorden stood there watching Sil, holding both Pai and Vicky in his hands. They weren't moving at all. For a second, he hadn't let them go and dragged them across the floor. When seeing that the others were okay, he finally let them go allowing them to drop to the floor.

The two that they had so much trouble dealing with had been dealt with, so quickly and it was so overwhelming.

"He's gotten so much stronger, right?" Borden said with a smile. "I couldn't believe it as well until I saw him fighting against the Dalki. It's like he has had some kind of awakening."

Although the other two didn't say it, both Vorden and Raten were thinking the same thing. Right now, the look on Sil's face as he walked towards them, the way he used his abilities and had no care for the safety of the others, reminded them of Hilston.

"I'm going to beat that old man. I won't let that Dalki get him first!" Sil declared.
