Chapter 883: The original vampires

There was only one known vampire settlement where all the thirteen families lived together. They were condensed to one area because this was where all the resources were and where all the leaders were gathered. Similar to a human city. It made it easier for family leaders in a way to keep an eye on them and control them.

If one was to leave the settlement, they could only do so under strict rules, this was all because the vampires wish to keep themselves a secret.

On the surface, and to the people it would appear as if they were one unit working together. However, those higher up knew there was more of a divide than others thought between the thirteen families.

Even in the past, the special fourteenth family and split off and made their own settlement, something many vampires didn’t know about today.

Outside of the settlement, the planet was mostly covered in forest and mountains, and here there were beasts just like any other planet. Once in a while, there would also be wild familiars that had hoped over to their world. They seemed to be attracted to the vampire’s strange ways, as wherever they would be, the familiars seemed to turn up as well.

The planet was large, so it was hard for them to keep track of everything that was on it, and this was how quite a distance away, the Bloodsuckers were able to build their base without the vampires knowing about it for years.

Still, there was one thing lacking on the planet for the vampires and the Bloodsuckers to live, and that was blood. The vampire settlement had that, while the Bloodsuckers did not. Seeing the cave full of blood packs and how long the Bloodsuckers were able to survive, Silver knew someone was working with them. She just didn’t know how big that person was, or how deep it ran on for.

Right now, in the middle of the forest, between the vampire settlement and the Bloodsucker base. Silver, Fex, Nate and Leo were standing back to back surrounded by bloodsuckers when one man walked out, one Silver recognised.

When a vampire was growing up in school, they would learn of the vampire’s history. Although a lot of it was altered, they all did learn of one thing. How the vampires originally started, with the thirteen original vampires. This was where the thirteen families came from.

Of course, during their time, there was no technology to take a photo of them as such, so the only references they had were paintings and drawings, but Silver was sure of it, based on what Leo had told her about the man’s aura she was sure of it, because the man looked almost identical to this paintings, not changing in the slightest.

"I pay my respect to the Eighth original vampire leader." Silver said, putting one of her hands on the floor and bowing her head down.

"This place has changed too much, do vampires not even know our names anymore? All of you were born or turned by us originally, and everyone seems to have forgotten that. She was right; things have changed." The vampire said, as he lifted his hand and swung it back.

"You shall remember my name is Remus Snacker!" Shouting out these words, they seemed so powerful that Silver could feel her body shaking, and soon after, his hand swung back out, heading straight towards her.

She could feel that Remus, the original, was about to do something to her, but she didn’t know what to do. These were the originals, should she move, or take the hit, but wasn’t this original working with the Bloodsuckers?

Her mind was mixed with too many thoughts. She was just frozen in place.

"Silver!" Fex shouted, as he could see the hand moving towards her face, but he was unable to move fast enough. He didn’t know why but seeing her in danger, he had to urge to protect her.

However, one person was fast enough, pulling out a dark red sword from his sheave, and he clashed with the hand coming out towards him. The hand didn’t swing back, but it stopped mid-air.

The original hadn’t used any hardened blood, but the original’s arm seemed fine, until a small cut could be seen, and soon Remus pulled his hand away.

On this journey, Leo had brought with him two swords. Leo was not a dual swordsman, so he could only use one sword at a time. This was his speciality. The reason he carried two, was because before leaving, he had grabbed a sword created by Alex. Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

This sword, made with legendary tier crystals, was far stronger than his last one, there were no active skills, but it was powerful, and it was perfect in Leo’s hands. Which was why, it was even more frightening that the man in front of him only received a single scratch from his strike.

’No wonder vampires never felt the need to use beast weapons. If this is how they originally started, did vampires weaken with time?’ Leo wondered.

With Remus’s other arm free, using blood control, he was able to take out parts of the infected blood and throw it onto the ground.

"Fairy blood, so this is your special trick. Who is your side working with? Have the Werewolves returned?" Remus spoke.

Silver was making note of what Remus was saying, it sounded odd, as if he had woken up not too long ago, and was slightly dazed, not knowing what was going on in the current world. He spoke of creatures that hadn’t existed for many centuries.

"Silver, are you going to just stand here and let this man take your life!?" Leo shouted back. "I don’t know who this man is, but it is clear to me that right now, he stands in our way. Your brother is still not back to the way he used to be, and we’re in trouble here. The others might be in a worse position than us."

She knew Leo was right, but could they even go up against an original? The everlasting immortal beings that lived for thousands of years. They had more time than any vampire to hone their strength, and Leo’s sword had only put a scratch on him.

Even though she had her family’s Puppet, she couldn’t imagine going up against such a great one.

The Bloodsuckers had now creeped out from the forest and were walking towards the others, and eventually, one of them looked like it had waited long enough before receiving an order, as it leapt out towards Fex while the others remained.

"Fex use your string!" Nate said.

"String? What the hell! Why would I carry string on me? and what use is it going to do against a monster like that!" Fex shouted back.

Seeing that Fex might have also forgotten how to fight, Nate had no choice but to move in front of Fex, and block the attack. He no longer had his hardening ability, so he could only raise the shadow from his feet to block the blow.

The attack was blocked, but Nate could tell how powerful the punch was based on how many Mc cells it felt like he had lost from the one hit.

"If you can’t use your string, then hit him now!" Nate shouted.

That was one thing Fex did know how to do. He didn’t really know what these creatures were, but he did know that they had kept him up in that dark cave, and putting all his anger, he punched the Bloodsucker right in the stomach, hitting him away, but it had only moved a short distance.

It wasn’t dead, and there were still plenty surrounding them.

"I can’t Silver." Said, throwing her hands down in defeat. "I just can’t attack an Original. This crime would be greater than any other if I did this."

"That’s okay," Leo said. "You just protect the others then."

Leo is going to fight the original on his own, and Silver couldn’t help but think it was a lost cause, even with his strength, but Leo had a trick up his sleeve.

Remus casually reached out his hand again, and Leo went out to strike it like the time before.

’Quinn, thank you for teaching me this.’ Leo thought as he coated his blade in the second stage of Qi, and slashed downward. A few seconds later, and Remus’s hand could be seen falling to the floor.
