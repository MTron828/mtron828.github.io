Chapter Ôªø1894 Friends and Enemies (Part 2)

The two vampires, Vanessa and Lucas, had caught up with Peter and Chris pretty fast. Although neither of them claimed to be strong vampires, otherwise they would have joined the vampire corps or something of that nature, they did pride themselves on their stealth skills. Which they often used as the two were quite nosy.

At the same time, due to the constant bickering that was going back and forth between the two, it felt like they didn't even have the time to notice they were being followed. Eventually, they entered the main fountain.

The two continued to hide themselves, and pretended to be a lovely couple that was just enjoying the fountain. They walked up to the outer rim of the fountain, while placing their hand in the water. At the same time, their ears were on high alert as they listened in to the conversation, and in the first few sentences they couldn't believe it.

"Did she just say what I think she said?" Vanessa asked.

"I heard it as well. They said he was the leader of the Graylash, that means Zinon Graylash is here right now." Lucas whispered back.

The Graylash leader was one that spent most of his time on his own planet with the high ranking officials in the Graylash family. Sure he made several public appearances on planets from time to time, but due to him being quite the popular leader, whenever there would be an event, it was almost impossible to even catch a proper glimpse of him.

"Who are these people, to know the leader of the Graylash family? Not just that, to actually get him to meet them here in secret!" Vanessa asked, still whispering but was finding it hard to keep her voice down due to the sheer shock of everything.

Immediately, she pulled out a strange device, it was the size of a nail, but upon pulling it, it grew larger until it was the size of her hand. A screen had appeared and immediately she started typing away.

"What are you doing?" Lucas asked.

"What do you mean, this is huge news. This is a scoop, there has to be a reason why he is here. We need to send this to someone!"

Right now, Vanessa was pinging the most famous reporter that she knew. BandV station. BandV station had a host that went by the name of AJ, and he had recently grown more in popularity after the Chained wedding. Being able to capture the other side of the story and the best of the best scenes.

A reporter as famous as him got hundreds of messages a day about potential scoops and usually he wouldn't bother looking through his messages but at the moment he was in a pretty sour mood. This was because there were constant reports going off about Pure base, Rein, being attacked and by Chris of all people.

Since he lived on the Graylash planets AJ wasn't the first one at the scene, so he was looking for the next big thing and was checking all of his incoming messages and that's when he saw Vanessa's message.

"What is this? This has to be something... I can feel it... this strange tingling sensation I'm getting all over my body!" Immediately AJ got out of his chair and using his superspeed ran to his ship, to fly off to the said Graylash planet.

It wouldn't take long, after all, AJ was a wealthy person and a fast ship was needed for his job in order to get to the next place as fast as possible.

After Zinon had somewhat introduced himself, Chris noticed that there was quite a gaze looking in his direction.

"Sorry." Zinon said. "But you should know why I am a bit unfriendly with those from Pure. We made the deal with your group so you would stay out of things. Yet you still used the dhampirs to meddle with us as a way to get around our agreement."

Chris couldn't deny that fact because it was true. Even though the Graylash family had signed a deal with Pure, they were doing the exact thing he said, whenever they would need something or to go after someone in the Graylash planets.

"However, I am not here for that. I am here because of a different matter." Zinon tensed up for a second, and he was silent for around a minute before he walked up to Chris, and looked up to him. Chris was a large man, a much larger man than Zinon, but he knew he had to be tough.

"I needed to ask you in person, are you, or do you know, the one that killed Owen Graylash," Zinon asked, not breaking eye contact and not looking away.

Vanessa opened up her mouth wide hearing these words and before she could gasp, Lucas placed his hand over it. Just then, a certain individual had run right by the fountain, at a great speed, and stood by their side.Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

"What did I miss?" AJ asked, as he opened up his secret camera in his jacket, twisted his hat that also had another camera on it, and began to film everything.

"You're not going to believe even if we told you." Lucas replied.

"I... I don't know." Chris replied. "I don't know who killed Owen. However, I doubt it was Zero, but I do have some information. These guys." Chris pointed toward Peter. "When they fought against the Dahmpir Queen.

"It seemed like she had a familiar with her, well not just one familiar, but a few of them and one of those was Genbu, the great turtle."

Hearing those words, Zinon felt like his eyes had gone bloodshot in that instant, and out of his control lightning was starting to spark a little off his clothes. This was because the turtle was somewhat of a legendary figure.

Owen had stayed with that turtle for a long time, there were even statues of it at the palace. Whoever owned it now, in his mind was the most likely culprit in Owen's death.

"I thank you. I needed to speak to you in person, I needed to see if your eyes were telling the truth. Hopefully, this will allow me to get to the truth. The truth of what happened to Owen Graylash."

Now AJ, who was standing at the side, couldn't believe it. This was a far bigger scoop than he could have imagined and to top it all off, he also recognized one of the figures, because they too were also at the Chained wedding event.

"I didn't go live... I didn't think it was going to be a huge scoop so I didn't go live." AJ said as he started to broadcast live. He didn't give the live stream any special title, because he feared that if they found out where they were and who the masked figure was, then there would be a rush of people at the square and he would lose his big story.

"I have to thank you both, for bringing this to my attention," AJ said. "I promise you will have enough to last you a lifetime... well at least a human's lifetime" he corrected himself.

"Okay." Zinon said smiling. "About your request, we can check things out inside the building behind us. Let's not waste any time."

The second Zinon turned around, he and a few others noticed something in the sky, right above the fountain.

"This..." Chris said.

"We've seen it before." Peter finished off the sentence, and so had Lucia seen it.

The white light that started to gather, that dispersed the clouds out of the area. It was getting larger and larger, until a white beam shot down, hitting the fountain.

Immediately, Zinon used his powers to create a lighting barrier, surrounding the white light energy just in case it was harmful to the public. However, the energy didn't spread, and soon it started to fade away, but It had left a certain individual standing in the fountain having destroyed the centrepiece.

"I, God Hinto, have come to destroy the God Slayer."
