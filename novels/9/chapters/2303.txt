The others had given the terrible news to Quinn. Stating how they had died, and what they had all gone through. Fighting Pine, and straight afterwards needing to deal with H as well. When telling their tales, they didn't diminish any of their feats.

How the Blades, Ceril, and Wince had fought against the five Spike Dalki, doing their best and doing everything they could to hold them back, in order to protect the people. Then there was Stark.

His tale was a large one. They explained how he had helped rescue Sil in the first place, then went on to detail how he had helped Sil in protecting him on one of the planets, finally his sacrifice in taking Jack out, and how it had an impact on the war, and on what H was trying to do at the last moment.

Quinn was more than upset hearing all of this, all he could do was think about them and their thoughts as they went through everything. He had expected losses in a fight of this scale. Of course it would have been good if no one had to lose their lives.

But what troubled him the most, was the fact that it was outsiders who had lost their lives in this war. People who Quinn had come to and asked for help. If he had never gone to Wince and Ceril, if he had never gone to the Penswi planet, then would they all have lived through this war.

'You can't think like that.' Alex said, speaking into Quinn's mind, still present in the armour. Due to the connection the two had this way, there were times where Alex could hear Quinn's thoughts. ùëÖread latest chùíÇpters at n/ùíêv(e)lbiùíè(.)co/m

'Thinking like that diminishes their sacrifices. Without Ceril, would you have ever been able to find the information you needed? Without Wince on your side and the Mermerials, would they have been able to fight back as long as they did, and without Stark would any of this would have worked out?

'In the end, if none of them did these things, then there's a good chance we would have never won this war, and then both the Penswi and the Mermerial planets would be gone. So you thinking that it's your fault for dragging them into this, that's just disrespectful to them.'

Alex's words gave him some comfort, but it was still not enough for Quinn. He had a big question on his mind, was there ever a time, or a way he could stop losing the people he cared about? Conflicts seemed to continue to rise one after the other and what was the cause of it all.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Quinn and the others still had a lot to do even though the war had ended. The Amra along with Geo and Dober safely left the tower. They were saddened by the destruction of the city and all of their planets.

Everything would have to be rebuilt from scratch. Although they would have help in doing so. The Mermerials and the Penswi all agreed to send aid and help.

On top of that, the Earthlings would help as well. After Sil made a full recovery, eating and looking like his former self once again. The device had been used on Earth and all the local planets, changing everyone's memories back to the way it was.

This continued on the beast planets, where the Graylash faction controlled, and the vampire settlement as well.

When people had learned of what really happened, there was a lot of anger, and they wanted that anger to lash out at someone, someone to blame. At first a lot of it was pointed towards Logan, even though he wasn't to blame.

The ones to blame were dead, but the people needed to push their anger out somewhere. In the end, Quinn was needed to make a speech, he was the one that was able to calm everyone down.

Because, in all of this, Quinn was the biggest victim and they listened to his words. The anger had turned into guilt, and in order to get rid of some of that guilt, the humans and vampires needed to act.

They were to help with the restoration of the Amra planets, and not only those planets, but the Namriks and every other planet that they had attacked. They would help the others with technology, passing on knowledge and so on.

This wasn't a one time hand out either, Quinn wanted to make it a longer commitment. They had done so much damage to the other planets and they needed to repay that.

There was also a special ceremony that had been decided to be held on the Amra planets. It was to honour all of those that had fallen in the war. All three races had agreed on a date to meet and honour all of those that died.

Quinn had also been invited, along with the others that had helped in the war. A large stage was built, and a special large monument, a thick large pillar, that had the names written down of every single person who died.

Right at the very top there were four names displayed, of those who had contributed the most in the war, names that were never to be forgotten.

Speeches were made of each person's story and the sacrifices they had made, to some it might have sounded like the stories were amplified for the sake of their heroic deeds, but many of them knew that it truly wasn't the case.

‚Äî‚Äî

After the ceremony was over, Quinn decided to head back to the vampire settlement, and live there with his family once more. There was still some clear resentment between vampires and humans.

Although no longer enemies and both aware of each other, they just felt safer living apart.

In the vampire settlement itself, Ronkin and Jeouk were standing on top of one of the houses, looking out at one of the castles in the distance.

"I still can't believe it, that I was next to the great Quinn the whole time, and I didn't even know it." Ronkin said. "It's so strange, every time I think about it, I want to kick myself, how can one's memories be affected so much?

"Do you know, we used to just go around patrolling together every day, no one would believe it."

Jeouk nodded along, as he heard this for the tenth time already.

"I knew he was special even without memories of him. Ever since I saw him on that ship, training everyone in hand to hand combat. It's why I never went against him. I wonder what he's going to do now, and how he's going to change this place."

"Well, one thing is for sure, his family will definitely be treated completely different now. I can just imagine the look on all of the kids faces when Minny goes back to school."

Behind the castle, in the large garden around the round table, a meeting was taking place. All of the originals, as well as the old family leaders that had been awakened, and those like Muka were there, while Quinn sat at the head of the table.

There were a lot of times where he would just push the duty off to someone else, but somehow he had become somewhat in charge of the vampire settlement. It felt natural to all of the others.

Rather than running away, Quinn just went with the flow this time. It was a lot easier compared to the past, as everyone felt like they were more inclined to listen to him.

"There has still been no news about where Magnus currently is, and no one has seen him." Edvard stated.

"Is he really someone that we should be worrying about so much?" Bianca replied. "He is just one vampire and can't do much on his own."

"Your correct." Hikel interrupted. "But he is not just any vampire, he is one of the originals and a former king who had ignited a war. His beliefs are still the same as they were in the past.

"The fact that he hasn't given himself up and gone into eternal slumber means he must be planning something."

A lot of the originals wanted to go back into eternal slumber, leaving everything to the newer generation, but they felt like Magnus was their problem to deal with, and until that was dealt with, then they wouldn't go back to sleep.

"There is one connection we can try." Grenlet added. "Magnus had a student, no? Perhaps he knows something, or what Magnus was planning."

Honestly, Quinn was considering leaving this whole thing alone. Jim and Jack had been dealt with. There were no more big threats, so why go chasing after one. The celestials had kept their word, and hadn't gotten involved at all.

Yet, there was a sick feeling in his stomach about all of this.
