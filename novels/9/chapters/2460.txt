Chapter 2461 Sil's Loyalty (Part 2)

Although Sil hadn't got a direct answer to the question he had, wondering what type of power this Pultra had. The fact that one had such an effect, that just being alive could affect the things around them, showed to a degree the amount of power that was inside this being's body.

Having battled against celestials and god slayers, he had a good idea what great strength was, and he knew it was in front of him.

Pultra smiled as she heard the question. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

"I had a good guess in mind from seeing him here that you would be asking." Pultra replied. "But, even if all the champions gathered, we do not stand a chance against Immortui and his demon kings. I know there are many that believed we only lost because we fought by ourselves‚Ä¶ but that is not the case, and if you faced Immortui as well, you should know that."

Calva did know that, the dream of them three teaming up, it was a pipe dream that was created by the inhabitants, one to give them some type of hope that the way the things currently were wouldn't be like that forever.

"I know." Calva said. "Did you really think I would ask for your help if I didn't? It's not the same as before, you see these guys, these people from another world, are here with us. Their goal is to take down Immortui as well."

Pultra was about to laugh the whole thing off, as she began to walk back to the large tree.

"I am surprised, because I heard that you also rejected Immortui's offer, and you had done so till the very end." Pultra said. "What made you so delusional?"

"A demon king was defeated." Calva said, and Pultra stopped in her tracks.

"Not only that, but the person who had defeated the demon king, had done so with ease, and I'm not just saying that either. I saw it with my own two eyes, I saw someone who could take down Immortui‚Ä¶ but they need our help."

This had piqued Pultra's interest as she turned back around. The reason Pultra was trapped down here was because of the eye of a demon king. She had gauged their strength well, and not once had the demon kings struggled with the up and coming strength of the inhabitants.

It was why she hadn't acted, nor had Shinto or Calva against them, it was a lost cause

"How can I even trust your words, how sure can I be that you aren't just saying something out of desperation?" Pultra asked.

"You might not believe him, but you can believe me." Sil lifted his hand and snapped his finger.

Suddenly the scenery all around them had completely changed. The surface was barren, with nothing but land, not a single thing was left alive on it. When Pultra looked around, she was unable to see the walls, and failed to see the familiar scenery around her.

"What happened, where are we!" Pultra asked, and she appeared to be startled.

"I teleported us out of where you were." Sil answered. "Don't worry I can put us back, and I will do before anyone notices that you are gone."

"Why have you brought us here?" She asked.

Even Calva was confused. What was the use of bringing her to this planet? At least he should have brought them back to where Quinn and the others were. Then she could comment on whether or not the condition Quinn was in was something she had experienced before. That was one of the main reasons for going after Pultra.

'Shouldn't we have at least done that before doing this! Even if she won't help us in the fight, and doesn't believe us, she can help us with Quinn!' Calva wanted to shout out.

However, Sil seemed confident, and although Calva didn't know him well. For some reason his calmness in the entire situation, even when in a world surrounded by enemies he didn't know about, was frightening in itself.

"This right here, is a moon of one of the many planets in the universe. It is one that is far away from any life that I can sense or know of." Sil said, as he brought out his ability book with his powers, and changed them once again.

"You don't trust Calva fine, but then trust me, my strength and my will to defeat Immortui. Let's fight, and then you can see for yourself." Sil stated.

It was an interesting proposal. One that Pultra would have outright refused, but the fact that they were now on the moon, she could only imagine what power the person had in front of her.

Maybe it all wasn't just lies by Calva, a person like Immortui was sure to make enemies along the way that would hate him to their very bones.

"Fine, it's a deal!" Pultra agreed and without giving any time at all, she lifted her leg and a sharp line of power came shooting straight out. It was incredibly fast, one of the fastest attacks Sil had ever seen.

If Calva was in Sil's situation he would have been hit straight away and would have had to continue the fight with a large injury. Yet for Sil, the attack had just gone past him creating a large deep cut on the surface of the moon.

"You avoided that, well then let's see you avoid all of this!" Pultra started to swing her legs rapidly. In all sorts of different directions. Several lines shaped like large crescent moon strikes were going through the air.

It was slicing the surface of the moon as if it was butter, and yet somehow, Sil, seemingly using nothing at all, was avoiding them all. He then started to walk towards her as he continued to avoid the strikes.

"Are you surprised?" Sil said.

He then teleported right behind her, but Pultra could sense this, she threw a direct kick right behind her, but Sil had already ducked avoiding it, and had a fist full of lighting. It struck her in the stomach, sparks going off in all directions, then twisting his hand, a lighting strike went straight out, sending her flying in the distance and crashing against the floor.

Pultra did her best as she got up off the ground, and when doing so the ground was shaking underneath, she jumped to the side to avoid a large piece of the moon rising from the ground but when she jumped the piece of the ground had hit her right in the stomach, and at almost the same time another lighting strike had hit her.

Sil was using his ability of foresight to be able to see her next set of moves and avoid them all. It worked well against someone like her who relied on just their physical power and had next to no wide range attacks.

"You're‚Ä¶ so strong." Pultra said, as she noticed Sil had stopped attacking. Calva, seeing Sil fight for the first time, thought the same thing. They didn't just have one golden goose, a shot at taking out Immortui, it was possible they had more.

"Yes, and the person who's going to take down Immortui is much stronger." Sil said.
