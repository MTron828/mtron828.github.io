Chapter 2336 ¬†The colossal

Quinn along with the others were still in Green City, and they were in Logan's lab. They were keeping an eye on the specially made device, and keeping track of exactly where Jessica went.

They were following her every move, and were waiting for Magnus to turn up. So they knew when this was the case, the tracking device which had been put in her skin under the back of her ear, so it wouldn't be found, was also able to transmit sound.

So they were able to hear everything that was going on, and that's why it was a big surprise to them all, when they heard who's name had been shouted out.

"Andy‚Ä¶ as in Fex's son!" Quinn shouted. "Why is he there?"

"It would make sense. A lot of this matter involves those in the Vampire Corps. That was the creation of Fex and Samantha's work. As the leader, he wouldn't just stand by and do nothing. Besides, weren't you the one that told him to help out, and sent out a warning?"

It was true, Andy and Fex were made aware of the situation, but that's when they were going up against random marked vampires, not Magnus, a dedicated follower and orginal. Andy was strong, so Quinn felt he could deal with most that came his way, but was he strong enough to go against Magnus?

"From the sounds of it, he's been putting up a pretty good fight against Magnus, who is this guy?" Edvard asked.

Logan brought up a screen with information on Andy, thinking that it would be quicker to show and explain at the same time.

"Fex was a vampire noble, but not just any vampire noble, one related to the leader of the Sanguinis family. His wife Samantha White was a strong individual even as a human, but eventually she was turned and had become a subclass a Draugr, and later evolved into a Great Draugr.

The others being originals knew about draugrs and their great strength. A Great Draugr was even rarer but were also able to change their form and size as well.

"As for Andy, he was born as a draugr himself and learned the ability of the 13th family. However, eventually he had continued to evolve and turned into one of the first of its kind, a Colossal Draugr. As for what they are capable of, it's somewhat unknown. We only know that they are also able to use blood aura."

The two originals were a little stunned, even with all of their years of living, there were new things that were popping up with the vampires that they had never seen or heard of before.

"Quinn, I think it might be best if you make your decision." Edvard said. "This Andy fellow seems quite strong, and he is the son of a good friend of yours. If we leave him be, and Magnus wins the fight, there is a good chance that he could lose his life or be converted into a strong enemy.

"On the other hand, if Andy is able to give Magnus a run for his money, then it means we will be able to swoop in and deal with this large thorn in our backside."

Quinn looked at Agent 4 when the question was given to him. He wanted to help Andy, and it was a good chance to get rid of Magnus, but if they failed, or Magnus got away, then would it ruin the second part of the plan.

Then there was the request he had made with Agent 4, if they got rid of Magnus now, then they might never be able to accomplish what they needed to do.

‚Äî‚Äî

Jessica didn't quite understand what was going on, she was sure of it, that the person that was protecting her right now was Andy, but he was dressed like Dzai, and he also used the same great sword as Dzai, while Andy, he was one who fought with his fists.

The two were even often compared to each other, in terms of strength.

Little did Jessica know that a secret that Andy had been keeping for a while now was unveiled. ¬†Dzai and Andy, were both the same person. Andy, being the head of the entire Vampire Corps meant it was almost impossible for him to be out in the field.

Only when large jobs came up would he participate, otherwise he would receive too much attention, or others would offer to do the job for him.

The thing was, Andy wanted to continue to improve, he also didn't want his skills to suffer. Which was why he became Dzai, the chief of the Green City Vampire Corps unit. Improving himself, he restricted what he could do, focusing on using beast weapons and his blood aura, rather than the rest of his natural abilities.

When learning of the case, and who the person was, Andy needed to get involved, he wanted to help Quinn, who had helped his father finally get the peace he wished for.

Placing both of his hands on the handle of the great sword, the edged side of the giant blade started to glow red. The aura was fiery but then condensed into a single line. After that, Andy threw it in the air, but it was attached to a red blood string. He swung it by his side in circles, it was going so fast that one could only see what looked like a shield of red.

When Jessica looked at the floor, she could see there was a perfect cut there as well.

Magnus, seeing that Andy hadn't moved, decided to store up his own blood aura, in both palms of his entire hands, he pushed them out, getting ready to fire two large blood canons.

These attacks were so strong in blood aura they would usually do harm to the user, but the originals were able to heal from such wounds, and Magnus had found a way where the attack hardly damaged him at all.

The attacks burst out, but Andy was calm. Swinging his sword, he used it like a shield, and the blade sliced through the attacks. It continued to hit the sword as it swung, but it sliced through the constant red aura, until there was nothing left.

"This fight‚Ä¶ it's like the new generation vs the old." Jessica said to herself.

"Now, it's my turn!"

Andy stayed in his position, he swung the sword, and the string started to extend. It had great momentum, while utilising his immense strength and swinging it down from above.

Magnus had no choice but to lift his hands above his head. The great sword landed right on top of him, crushing the ground beneath, and almost crushing him.

"Arghh!" Magnus had to use all his strength and power, including that of the borrowed power. The marking on his head glowed once again, and he managed to deflect the sword to the side, so it touched the ground.

When it did, a long line of blood aura went out for as long as one could see.

With the sword still attached to the red blood string, Andy was quick to use it again as he swung it to the side. Magnus was barely able to block the hit.

The sword was now swinging fast, coming from multiple directions and all Magnus could do was attempt to deflect the energy. REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

'If I keep blocking the hits like this, my energy is going to be depleted fast. Who knew there was such a strong individual from this new generation!'

Andy knew it was best for him to not get close in this fight. Otherwise he would have to suffer from the traps laid out by Magnus, which was why he continued to use his power like so.

He could continue to power the blood sword, using his blood aura through the string. What Magnus didn't know was that this was something his father had taught him as well. A vampire's soul weapon, and in his case, it was one that allowed him to pass blood aura through his strings.

It was why the sword was still so powerful but it wasn't enough, he needed a big hit to finish off his opponent.

Running forward, Andy was taking a risk, he pulled the blade from the string close to him, and held it by its handle.

With the sword held in his hand, he lifted it in the air, and his hand started to grow in size. The muscles from the shoulder, the forearm and even the hand itself. All of it was growing to the point where it looked like it was the hand of a giant.

The giant sword no longer looked giant.

"I will protect the Vampire Corps!" Andy shouted, as he swung his giant hand down with the giant sword, right where Magnus was.
