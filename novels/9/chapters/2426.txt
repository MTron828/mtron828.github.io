The sporting event that was explained to the children had been given a name and that was the Grand Meet Up! There were many names that had been suggested but with a vote from teachers from all groups, this was the name that was chosen in the end. 

The Grand Meet Up was still a week or so away, which was good timing, because the Mermerials were keen to push the meeting forward, and had told Muka that they were already on their way there. 

Although the vampires didn't know, there was a reason for the Memerials to be pushy about getting the meeting out of the way. Yongbu had dealt with a small group of Predators that were causing trouble. 

Yet, purposely he hadn't dealt with all the Predators, if anything, what he had done didn't result in much at all, but the message that he wanted to convey was clear. He was showing what he could do. 

Only after their part of the deal was complete would he get rid of the rest. In order to get rid of the big headache that was coming their way, they pushed for the meeting.

A couple of days had gone past, and it was finally the day for the Mermerials to arrive.

Layla was in the master bedroom. It was incredibly large with a dressing room that was as big as a house, a bathroom that was as big as an entire floor, and several other places for them to play and more. 

Galen would often sleep in a single bed that was placed in the corner along with them, and Minny would share a bed with her mother. It was the only way Layla would feel somewhat safe at night.

Walking across the room. Layla was staring at Galen straight in the eye. He was taking a few steps back as Layla did forward. She knew it was pointless trying to grab him, so instead she stood there. 

"Galen, today is a very important day. There are going to be guests all over the place, and mommy has to make sure they're looked after, understand?" Layla asked. 

Galen nodded his head. 

"Then that means, I don't want you going all around the settlement causing trouble."

This time Galen didn't shake his head, to which she looked him right in the eye again, until she broke contact. She needed to start getting ready and get changed.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The moment she turned around, she could feel a presence disappear. Turning her head back she saw  half a portal disappearing and Galen was no longer there. 

"What happened to the nice little kid that would help do chores around the house and set the table. How can someone change so much in such a short amount of time? I wonder if this is something all vampire mothers have to deal with." Layla looked out the window, and she could see giant blue ships approaching. 

"I need to hurry, he will be fine. He's been fine every day so far." Layla thought as she rushed to put on some clothes.

Layla had arrived in time and they were standing outside the settlement where the ships docked. It was right next to the settlement, a large open space, like that of a runway on an airport but it was more so like a car park for spaceships since it was easy for them to land. 

The back area had been cleared for them, and waiting patiently was Layla, Xander, Muka, as well as a group of 12 vampire knights standing by the side. This was a friendly race that was coming to them so they weren't expecting any hostility.

The ship had landed and a ramp descended touching the floor. Walking down the ramp, there was a group of four people. Two of them, old men, one woman and another younger looking man. Still looking to be in his mid thirties but quite a stark difference from the other Elders that had appeared. 

Around them as well, there were a couple of guards each for each person totalling six guards. They were dressed head to toe in glistening blue armour, as well as a helmet that covered their eyes and nose just showing the mouth. The helmet had a small trident shape on the top.

"Thank you for agreeing to the meeting on such short notice." One of the Elder men said, stepping forward. 

"No, thank you for coming." Muka replied.

"My name is Xoxy." The young man bowed down. "I am sorry to ask this, but I have recently been allowed into the council room and I was wondering, will we be able to see Quinn. I would love to thank him for everything he has done." 

Xox was straight to the point, and he found it strange that Quinn wasn't here in the first place. Truth be told his task was to look over Quinn. So when the Elders went to leave to head back, he would then change his form to one of the vampires and live among them,  keeping an eye on them, but where was his target. 

"I am afraid that Quinn has a matter to settle, he is currently far away and won't be able to join us, but if there is anything you wish to say to him, I will be able to pass it on." Layla replied. 

"What!" Xox blurted out. "I mean." 

He quickly cleared his throat and straightened his back. 

"I see, I guess he is a busy man, do you have any idea of when he will be back by any chance? I would really like to meet him if possible?"

A visible vein was starting to appear at the side of Layla's head. She hadn't expected these questions to pop up. It had already taken a lot out of her to come up with that lie, why was this Mermerials so obsessed with Quinn? 

'Does this guy want to marry him, why is he asking so many questions!' Layla shouted in her head. 

"I'm afraid I do not." Layla replied. "Depending on the task taken, he can take an extremely long time."

"Huh?" Xox facile expression changed. "You don't even know how long he will be, aren't you… his wife. How will I get to see him then?" 

"What I can do is inform you when he arrives back, how does that sound?" Layla smiled. 

Invisible sparks were flying between the two as smiles appeared on their faces. Sighing, Xox had to admit defeat, this person clearly wasn't going to give him answers, but it did make him wonder, just what was going on. 

'Maybe the Ancient One sent me here for a reason after all. It looks like I'll have to do some more investigating. If I can't get anything from his wife, then I will just have to look into his family instead, they might know something.' Xox thought.
