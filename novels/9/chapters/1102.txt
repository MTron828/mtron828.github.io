Chapter 1103 - All our strength

When Quinn and the others finally arrived back on the Cursed ship, all of them shared a sense of returning to somewhere they belonged. It was a bit strange to call a ship that constantly moved through space and could therefore be anywhere at any time ’home’, but they all felt this way.

They knew that here none of them would be judged for what they had done in the past, they didn’t have to watch what they had to say, and could mostly do as they wished. Everyone knew that with the situation with the Dalki there was a lot to be done, but it didn’t hurt to take a breather or two for a second.​​

The people around the base greeted Quinn as usual, respectful, with many congratulating him on saving the Graylash family and acquiring the Demon tier crystal. The atmosphere was still light, so it seemed that Sam had yet to inform what most of the Cursed group were. He was sure that once the truth was out, the treatment wouldn’t be exactly the same.

He asked around whether Leo and Erin had come back, but it appeared that they were still dealing with their own troubles.

"Hey Quinn, can you show me what Alex created for you?" Nate requested as he approached the Cursed faction leader. "Ever since I’ve heard the news that you guys managed to defeat a Demon tier beast I’ve been waiting for you to come back and show your new toy!"

Whenever Quinn was walking around the base, he would put all of his beast gear away, only equipping it when needed. It was the same for all those with the shadow ability.

"Believe me, I would love to, but it’s not ready yet. Alex is still busy making it." Quinn answered, not bothering to tell Nate about the new gauntlets he had.

"This sucks." Nate complained out loud. "I get why you want me to train the people here, but I’ve already taught them as much as I could about hand to hand combat. Initially, it was quite enjoyable watching them learn it quickly and improve themselves, but to carry on and improve even more just takes time. They need experience, and fighting against each other can only get them so far." Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"What I’m trying to say is, Quinn, I’m bored," Nate openly complained.

Quinn felt bad, Nate was one of the strongest people in his team, but he had felt that the Demon tier beast would have been too dangerous to take everyone. In many ways, he thought where they were going to go next was also a place only for those who had already proven themselves capable

There was also the issue that they needed to leave behind a strong crew on the Cursed ship, just in case they got attacked. At the same time if he would avoid taking new people with him, then they would really stagnate and would be unable to fight the Dalki when they arrived in full force.

At the moment, there were only small battles, but everyone could feel that there would be a full scale war soon. Both sides were just testing the grounds figuring out each other’s strength.

"Maybe there is something I can show you before I leave this time." Quinn suggested. "I’m sure it won’t bore you anytime soon and once you get the hang of it perhaps you could show it to the others as well."

Quinn then pressed his hand on the other’s c.h.e.s.t. In the past Quinn had been afraid of doing this, due to him accidentally turning others. The easiest way to show people Qi, was by making their bodies feel it moving around.

Vampires seemed not to have this Qi force on their own, yet those that had been turned did, so someone like Nate should be able to learn it. Nate closed his eyes to concentrate on the feeling, and Quinn started to swirl around the energy in his body.

"Try to follow along with me, focus on the energy and try to push and move it yourself." Quinn instructed.

It didn’t take long to feel it. He wasn’t very bright, but when it came to fighting instincts, something like Qi was perfect for him, and he could feel it almost instantly.

Then, Quinn’s hands were no longer touching his body.

"What was that?" Nate asked.

"I think you already got a feeling on how to use it yourself. Perhaps your years of studying martial arts have already allowed you to experience it, you just didn’t know the name for it. That was Qi. Leo was the one to teach me. Just remember this feeling and practice it. Also, try to come up with a way of teaching others without doing what I just did."

"Otherwise, there is the risk that you might accidentally turn them." Quinn said.

At first, Nate thought it was a joke but realised that Quinn was completely serious when he said those last words. Quinn had wanted to teach those on board Qi for a long time, but the only way he had learnt it, was through feeling the process through his body, and that was the only way he had taught it to the other students at school as well.

The thing was, Quinn didn’t know of a way to teach the others, and he didn’t have the time to go around touching everyone.

’Nate, hopefully you will become a better teacher than I.’ Quinn thought.

Suddenly, a meeting had been called as all of the cursed leaders were called to head to the command room.

When Quinn arrived along with Nate, he could see that most were already there, thankfully that included Eno as well, but his calm face from before looked to be more serious as he displayed a constant frown and his arms were folded.

Quinn didn’t even know when they had grown close and the strangest thing was actually the fact that Logan had wounds all over his body.

’What happened to him, did one of his inventions backfire or something? When was the last time I have seen him hurt this badly? Why didn’ he go see a doctor?’ Quinn wondered.

"Is the meeting going to start?" Dennis asked.

"Soon." Sam replied. "There is still one more person that needs to be here."

As the doors opened one more person walked in on his own, Shiro. He looked frightened as everyone stared at him, but when he saw Quinn, he tried to pretend to be confident and started walking over.

"It’s good to see you again, and I have to thank you for accepting my request." Quinn greeted him.

Shiro looked over at Sil, and then back at Quinn. Before he had been a power hungry person, but now he had a debt to pay. These people had saved his life multiple times, and he just wanted to be by their side and help them.

The lives of Shiro and the others had changed at school after meeting Quinn, and he knew that as long as he helped the Cursed faction, everyone’s lives would also change for the better.

"Okay, it’s time that we talk about Blade Island." Sam announced.

Somewhere a great distance away, in the beast solar system, a man stood in a large hall. His large frame was covered in diamond like armour from head to toe as well as a helmet with slits to allow him to see through it.

The man turned around and looked at the large hall behind him. Inside there were around a hundred people. Every single one of them attached to a metal rod sticking out of the ground, chained up.

"We have prepared for long enough. I never thought that I would meet someone beyond me, but that is why we must continue on. No matter what we must get Sil back, and this time I will use the power of all the chained here!"
