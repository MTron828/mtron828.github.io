The decision had finally been made on Russ' end. He would allow Sil to use his power. Whether it was the right thing to do or not, well, only time would tell. And if they were all to die here, then he would never find out.

There was one thing Russ was sure about, though, he had only done this because of Sil. When his life was saved, Russ felt like he could sense a bit of Sil's character, and during the fight, he could see the anger behind his actions and in his eyes.

Sil was like Russ, wishing to defeat the great person in front of him.

"I've given you my power, but you need to buy time until I explain everything to you!" Russ shouted.

It wasn't as if H was just going to let him explain in the middle of the fight, and from the looks of things, H had transformed both of his hands into two giant hammers, both of them spiralling with lightning.

Sil placed his hand on the ground, and it soon turned to mud. The mud was then shifting all over the place, pushing H back. With his strength, H had jumped out of the mud with relative ease, but when he landed on the ground again, he noticed that the whole ground was the same.

"This is annoying!" H shouted.

Changing his arms back, H now froze the mud around him, making it solid so he could stand on it. But in the middle of doing that, a large amount of water landed right on top of him, pushing him away and mixing with the mud.

As soon as the water touched his skin, it started to freeze as well, and now H was just trapping himself. With a 10 Spike's strength, though, a simple movement of the muscles would be enough to break the ice. It was more of an annoyance than anything.

Sil was doing as Russ said. Instead of using his powers to try and hurt H, he was almost delaying him instead. There was a reason why he had decided to somewhat trust Russ, who was a stranger to him.

For one, when Russ touched him, Sil could feel his MC cells changing, and in turn, he was able to acquire a new ability. This was a rarity. After so many years had passed, it was rare for Sil to ever come across a new ability, but it had happened here.

On top of that, when Sil copied an ability directly from a person like this, he also was able to know the amount of MC cells a person would have. This wasn't just a high-level ability; this was beyond any ability he had felt before.

"Has this person increased their power... maybe the same way I did? If that's the case, then this person is no ordinary person."

The fight was being lost, and something had to change. There weren't many options, so he would just have to go ahead with this.

"Tell me, what's your power? How do I use it?" Sil asked desperately.

Russ was grinding his teeth before he opened his mouth. He had never quite explained his ability so clearly to someone before, but he had to now.

"My ability allows you to access the minds of those around you. Depending on the amount of MC cells you have, you can either summon those with the power or change your own body based on those memories.

"Out of the powers you use, they can only be used in the way the person has remembered them, even if they remember them wrongly.

"So in some way, you have to have seen or know what the powers do in order to use them properly. Also, this is the important part, you are drawing out the power of their memory."

"What this means is that the power that has been drawn is only as strong as they think it is. In some cases, this is stronger than the actual power, while in other cases, it's actually weaker, so it's a risky game."

Based on what Russ was saying, even if Sil were to transform himself into H, a Ten-Spiked Dalki, there was also a chance that H didn't know his full strength. Going head to head, Sil might push H into a corner he has never been in before, and in that case, he would have no memory of when he was at his strongest and would lose. But there was another way.

Using his MC cells to transform himself and summon others as well.

The power sounded incredibly strong, but as with strong powers, Sil could only imagine that it would require a large amount of MC cells to do such things. He had already been fighting H for a while, and although his MC cell pool was incredibly large, it wasn't anymore.

If Sil had obtained the ability at the start of the fight, then he would have been able to summon another H for H to fight against, and then using his own powers, defeat the enemy. But he couldn't think about what could have happened and needed to think about how to solve the situation now.

Erupting in the centre of the area, a large flame appeared. It was gigantic in size and reached the clouds. The water in the area evaporated from Sil's abilities, while the ground H was standing on was starting to melt.

The intense heat could be felt by the others, and they were in pain just being in the area. The large fire soon condensed down and was now just emanating from H's skin, still covering his entire body.

'The power of fire, that's his fifth ability. I should have known he would have picked something like that,' Sil thought.

Although the lightning ability was considered one of the strongest elements, the fire ability, in many cases, was considered the most dangerous due to its destructive nature. With such power, one could eliminate entire armies and cities.

However, to be strong, one had to have a mix of powers to use, and too many elemental abilities weren't always the best bet unless they were able to carry a high number of abilities. That was why Sil thought the fire ability wouldn't be chosen, yet here it was.

'His MC cells, I have underestimated them myself... It can't be. The more he is damaged, the higher the power of the Dalki. Is that also increasing his MC count? Is he getting stronger the more hurt he gets in this fight?'

Sil was unsure about his thoughts, but it reminded him that he was fighting against H, not Hilston. Who knew how many powers he could hold or what the limit of the Dalki was. At the moment, H didn't look to be damaged at all, so there was a chance he could grow even higher.

"Look, I don't know what that woman is trying to do," Russ said, staring at Layla. "But I think she's trying to give you extra power or something. With your body the way it is now, it can't take that power.

"So the best bet would be to just turn yourself into that Ten-Spike, take whatever power it is that she wants to give you, and beat that guy, summoning a bunch of others around you to help!"ùíÇll new stùíêries at n0ve/lbi/ùíè(.)cùíêm

Although the Black Swordsman was strong, its power to negate abilities might work against Sil if the swordsman's form wasn't strong enough to defeat the current H in front of them.

"Thank you, but I have another idea," Sil said as he slapped Russ on the side of his arm, and he was teleported back away from the fight.

Teleporting himself, he soon moved Minny out of the way and teleported to Layla, tapping her and moving her back as well.

"In everyone's mind here, there is someone that we all see as the strongest. Even now, I can tell that you are all thinking about him because it's the same for me. He is someone who has never failed us, and he won't fail us now."

Shadows covered Sil's entire body, and when they spread out and disappeared, a completely different person stood in his place, with black curly hair and red glowing eyes.

The facial features weren't quite the same, as it was just something that Russ' ability couldn't completely do. Without a doubt, though, the person that Sil had decided to transform into was Quinn.

"I know that for all of you who have met Quinn, without a doubt in your minds, you would expect him to beat H. So let's make that a reality."
