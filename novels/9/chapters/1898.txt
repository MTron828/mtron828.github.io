Chapter Ôªø1899 Spider Blood

The Vampire Corps were already finding it hard to process what they had just seen. The amount of blood aura that had been used to create the swords in the first place, the power, and how they were used with such fine blood control to take out the army of beasts.

Since most of them were vampires, with a few subclasses here and there, they knew how impressive such a feat was, how impossible it was to have that level of blood control or aura that had been used.

Then, there was the large spear that had been used to destroy the Demon tier beast in a single hit. Right now, they knew they were looking at someone beyond that of a vampire.

All of that was going through the Corps members heads as they were told one thing. That the person in front of them was the legendary Quinn Talen.

At first they thought that Andy was playing a joke on them all. It just seemed so impossible and even the figure Quinn in the past and his feats seemed impossible for many of them as well.

However, when thinking about it a bit more, it was the only thing that would explain the situation, why he had so much power, and why someone was on such good terms with Andy.

"The Hero, is that really Quinn Talen?"

"I mean, it has to be right, only the hero could do something like that. He's the only vampire with such strength."

"But we were told that he died a 1000 years ago, and he hasn't appeared since, so why is he here now?"

It seemed a lot of them had their suspicions about Quinn and he could understand why, if he was in their shoes he probably would be thinking the same thing. For a second, Quinn turned to look at Andy who gave an awkward smile back.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

Andy was unsure what the reaction would be, outing him in public like that and doing so before talking it over with Quinn. Judging by the aura around him though, Quinn seemed to take it well.

'One day or another it was going to come out, and with the Red Vampires now working for us, the dhampirs are next to nothing. There isn't much to be worried about anymore, with the truth of me being returned‚Ä¶ I just wonder what the reaction will be from now on.'

While thinking all of this, Quinn had used his aura to create a set of claws around his fingers. Then. Grabbing his long hair that went down to around his waist, he started to slash and cut at it, making it shorter.

He was practically giving himself a very rough haircut in front of everyone that was there. After slashing his hair a few times, it started to curl up a bit like it had done in the past, and a few more seconds later, Quinn's hair was now just down to his shoulders.

"I needed that for a while now, but I thought the new look wasn't so much of a bad thing." Quinn stated.

Now with his haircut the vampires were getting a second look at the person in front of him. His hair was around the same length as it was before, making him look more like the statue, the statues that they all knew well.

"They look really similar, I mean they don't look exactly the same, there are few changes here and there but it's been so long."

"Plus, statues aren't going to look exactly like the orginal right?"

"Maybe it's just a look alike."

"With that much power, why are you in denial about everything so much?"

There was a stir brewing between them all, about whether or not this was the real Quinn, and soon questions started to pop in their minds, that if this was the real Quinn then what happened to him, where had he been this entire time.

Seeing how the situation was beginning to turn slightly and Quinn could see that there would be a bombardment of questions. He turned to Andy.

"You know what." Quinn said, as he summoned his shadow, and took Minny out of it. He had placed her inside during the fight, since it was so sudden. She soon hopped onto his back after and the other vampires seeing the shadow just started talking more.

"Look‚Ä¶ he even has the shadow ability. Only Quinn or the guardians have the shadow ability, he looks like Quinn, is as strong as Quinn, and has the shadow like Quinn as well‚Ä¶ it has to be him."

"Yeah and it looks like he has a kid as well. Maybe that's why he went into hiding for so long, to run off with the love of his life."

Now it was seriously getting strange, so once again Quinn placed his hand on Andy's shoulder. "I will leave this all to you. I think it is better for me to solve this problem on my own. Otherwise, the others will just slow me down.

"I hope all of this can be cleared by the time I get back, and I also hope that it won't take too long."

Entering his shadow on the ground, Quinn started to use his shadow travel to explore the various areas of Mars. He didn't have his wings at the moment, so it was the next best thing to get out of the area.

After disappearing off in the distance it left Andy just shaking his head.

"I guess I was the one that outed him, so I should be the one to deal with the consequences."

While travelling through his shadow, Quinn did make a quick stop at the Demon tier beast he had killed, and went ahead and grabbed its crystal. Although he was unsure how strong it was or what skill the beast had possessed due to it dying quickly, its crystal could still be used for repairs if needed, and if Jake Green came back empty handed.

After going out in the distance for a while, and toward where the beasts were heading from, Quinn noticed something that was different compared to before. In the past, there would be countless beasts in certain areas, but here it was a wasteland, just plant life, insects and so on, but no deadly beasts.

Eventually, Quinn decided to stop and come out from his shadow. Even if he was to travel at full speed it would take him a while to head around the entirety of Mars.

'It's a good thing that I have a lot of experience when it comes to dealing with Nest crystals thanks to that little journey I had with Sil. But how would I find such a thing?'

While thinking about this, an idea popped into Quinn's head‚Ä¶ something that might just work. Sitting down on the grass, crossing his legs, the vampire celestial made a cut on his hand. He also activated the celestial energy as he usually would have done. When the blood dripped onto the ground, it slowly started to spread out.

This looked similar to that of the blood forest skill that Quinn would use. The blood spread out on the ground in all directions, and it looked like a spiderweb of sorts made out of blood was appearing from Quinn.

The blood continued to flow out from his body, and while doing so it was spreading out, going further and further, the blood was being spread out as thin as possible while it was travelling in all sorts of different directions.

'I can control my blood well, and since it has my celestial energy in it, when it touches or gets close to the Nest crystal I should know.'

Quinn continued to do this, and as his blood spread out more and more, his celestial points were being used up, and his health was dropping slightly, but then, finally he had found something, an energy similar to that of the Nest crystal.

The thread of blood that had touched the crystal was lighting up, going right back to where Quinn was. But soon after that, several other threads started to light up as well, near the area where the Nest crystal was at.

'What is this?' Quinn thought. As it was something he had never experienced before.
