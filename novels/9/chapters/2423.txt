Yongbu had been keeping a track of the Mermerials and he knew when these old fools would have their weekly meetup, so he thought it was the best time to barge in. Currently there was a large hole through the ceiling due to how the two of them had entered, but he had done so on purpose to remind them all what he was capable of after all. 

"It's not like any of you have the power from stopping me anyway." Yongbu said, to which Xox kicked him on his shin, for the plan to work, they needed the Mermerials help, it was the only plan the two of them could come up with to keep up to date with what Quinn was doing.

Based on the information Xox had found, the Mermerials had allied themselves with Quinn. They had done so on more than one occasion and the connection between them and him was quite close. 

The closest link, the two princesses, no longer existed though, which was why they were in this situation. The Mermerials could always visit the vampire settlement and Quinn, on the basis that they wanted to keep their relationship on good terms between the two. That was the plan, as Xox entered disguised as one of the Mermerials. 

'If we enter this way, then none of the celestials will know about my movements, just like the Ancient One wanted, and no one from the vampire settlement should know that I am a god as well.' Xox was inwardly smiling thinking about how much of a genius his plan was.

Since they needed the Mermerials to do this, and it wasn't something just the two of them could do themselves, it was the reason why Xox was getting a little angry at Yongbu. 

Clearing his throat, Yongbu spoke up again. 

"With the unfortunate loss of the two princesses and no one left to replace them. I noticed that things have been quite difficult for the Mermerials." 

The elders started to look at each other. They had been far busier than they had expected, but it was something that they didn't like to admit. 

"These are the usual problems that we have to face and deal with. It comes with our position." Elder Setonia said. "It is not something we can't solve." 

"Are you sure?" Yongbu said. "Even before I influenced the Predators, they naturally ran wild. The princesses were powerful enough to rein them in, but there is now a big gap in your forces with them gone. 

"As time goes on, I can only imagine more joining them. Then as you fail more and more, the people will believe you less and less, ultimately making the situation the same as it was before, and unlike this time, there is no royal family for the general public to band behind. There is no one that will be there to save them this time. 

"As you know, the Predators listen to me well, and even if they don't listen to me, I have the power to deal with them if it really comes to that." 

Immediately, as they heard Yongbu say these words, there was an uplift in the mood and the expression on the other Elders' faces started to change. After all, Yongbu was actually a being that was once worshipped by all. 

It was only as time went on, that there were rumours that a powerful god had taken the side of the Predators, and when it turned out to be true, there was much distaste left in their mouth especially those in the royal family.

"The fact that you have come here to tell us all of this, rather than do anything about it, means that you must want something from us, something out of this deal?" Setonia asked, able to see right through the god. "Otherwise, such a kind person would have just solved the issue for us for free, so just tell us what you want."

"Fine." Yongbu said. "I will deal with the Predators for you, indefinitely for as long as I am alive, as long as you set up a friendly meeting with the vampire settlement."

Many of the Elders wanted to accept the deal on the spot. Would all of their headaches go away with such a simple request?

"Why would you want to meet with the vampires, and why not head there yourself, why are we the ones that need to head there?" The elder asked. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"You know the relationship between me and Quinn is not the best. However, I wish to rebuild the relationship between the two of us. It would benefit me greatly to do so. I'm afraid if I was even to set foot there that I would be killed before I even got to speak." 

Many of the Elders nodded in agreement, they had heard what had happened, and they knew of the incredible strength Quinn possessed. 

"What if this is a plan for you to get back at him?" The Elder asked. "Then it would ruin the relationship that we wish to keep with Quinn and the vampires."

"First of all, many of the vampires had killed the Mermerials as well." Yongbu replied. "The relationship between the vampires and the Mermerials aren't at its best either, just with Quinn. A meeting with the two I believe can help build relationships between all of us. 

"Even if I did have anything planned, do you really think I would be able to do anything to Quinn, with the power he has? Either way, I don't plan to go myself for fear something would happen to me. Which is why I don't plan to go myself. I wish to send a proxy on my behalf." 

That was the cue for Xox to stand forward. 

"Xox is a servant of mine, who has been serving and looking after me. He is just a normal member of the public just like you, there is nothing special or different about him at all as you can see!" 

Once again, Xox kicked Yongbu's shin. He was playing the act a little too much, and making it obvious.

"I will use him to convey my words to the vampires, and to Quinn, in hopes to build up our relationship. I believe this deal benefits you greatly in many ways." 

After letting Yongbu say everything he needed to say, the Elders decided to have a meeting. They had asked the two to leave the room while they continued to discuss and deliberate over what to do. 

They talked for a couple of hours, and had yet to come to a decision, until finally the two were invited back into the meeting room. 

"We have made a decision. We will accept your proposal." The Elder said.

With all that done, Xox was over the moon, he could accomplish the task needed to be done although Yongbu wouldn't be with him, which was why he had a few words of wisdom for the god. 

"Xox, I just want to inform you, when you go to the vampire settlement, that Quinn isn't the only one you have to worry about." Yongbu said. "That whole family is crazy, so be careful."
