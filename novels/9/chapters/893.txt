Chapter 894: A rising energy

The tide was still in the tenth families favour on the battlefield, but there was still one big problem they needed to deal with, Jill. A leader had great strength, and quite rightly so, some could turn the tides of a battle by themselves.

Paul was still down on one knee as the voices in his head continued from those that he cared about most. However, for a brief second, they had stopped, and when he looked up, he could see Peter walking towards him.

’Of all the people to come and save me at a time like this, I never thought it would be this guy.’ Paul thought.

Peter was now standing directly above him and had his hand held out.

’I think my opinion might have changed of you.’ Paul thought, seeing that he was giving him a helping hand.

"Your gloves," Peter demanded. "If you’re going to be so useless fighting against her, then you don’t need those weapons, do you?"

Peter wasn’t offering his hand to help Paul up. Instead, he was demanding for the beast weapons in his hands. Slightly confused by the demand, he hesitated, and before he knew it, Peter was pulling them off him and wearing them.

He looked at them for a few seconds and gave a few practice swings in the air. He could throw his hands out like fists, but the claws had better range and were made with fairy blood.

It was the first time Paul had seen Peter really move up close like he was doing now. With each strike, a sharp noise was made as the blades slashed through the wind. Seeing this, he only thought one thing. ’Fast’ Peter was incredibly fast, and judging how he sent Jill across the battlefield, it looked like he was strong as well.

If there was anyone that was a dark horse that the other families probably would have underestimated, it would be him.

A vampire came running towards Peter, and he was simply whacked away with the palm of his hand, further proving his strength was on the same level as a leader. Ignoring everything going on around him, he had his eyes set on one person and one person only.

Jill, who was recovering from the punch dealt to her face, her cheek slightly red and still in the middle of healing. She could see Paul starting to stand up, and she knew what was coming next.

’That punk from before is back, but I can only direct the thoughts into one person at a time. I don’t think it will do much on that idiot, and the knight seems like more trouble in the first place.’ Jill decided, as she once again activated her abilities.

Paul this time, could ignore the thoughts better. As he was getting used to it, something had changed. Now, not only were sounds being transmitted into his head but images to go with it. As he heard his fellow team-mates scream in pain, images proceeded, some of them were getting clawed at, and their limbs torn, or were bleeding out.

The images were even blocking his own real vision, and he was finding it hard to see in front of him.

’Looks like she can do a lot more than just become a mobile phone for the vampires.’ Paul started to think, but he smiled, because he knew he didn’t have to worry about her.

Peter immediately rushed in head first, and he had caught up to where Jill was in an instant. He threw out one of the claws, and it was faster than she had anticipated.

’How is he as fast as a leader? I thought he had just caught me off guard.’ But there was one thing that vampires had that Wights didn’t, and that was blood skills. Using the blood hardening, she blocked the powerful attack and threw out a blood swipe, hitting him on the shoulder.

However, feeling no pain the punch continued, and this time when he had hit her, it was with the claws from Paul, causing immense pain through her body. Using the blood control took time, same with the blood hardening, and Peter was ignoring his own body damage to deal blows to Jill, knowing full well she would be hurt more by it.

"Damn you!" Jill screamed as she gritted her teeth with a mouth full of blood from the hits she was taking. She attempted to slash Peter’s head right off, But both his arms and weapons had blocked his head, with another pair in front of them.

Looking at it, Jill could see that the other pair of arms was from someone she knew. It was her own knight Tifu that had been raised from the dead.

"Protect the head, it was the only lesson Edward taught me, and it’s the only lesson I need!" Peter shouted. Tifu, grabbed onto Jill, and Peter stabbed one of the claws right into Jill’s t.h.i.g.h.

The blades dug in deeper than before, and the effect was taking over her whole body.

’I...I....I can’t win.’ She had finally admitted to herself. ’Where the hell is my help, just wait Bryce... let’s see how you deal with this failure...’ One second Peter could see her, standing in front of him, proud and the next second he could see her running off, and soon after the rest of her people started to follow her.

Finally, the images in Paul’s head were stopped along with the sound.

’Is it over?’ Paul wondered.

As the battlefield in front of him was clearing. The eighth family had retreated.

Although the fight was over in front of the castle, there was still the fight at one of the other gates.

———

Erin had just witnessed Cindy attempting to kill Layla, and in the end, another was sacrificed in her place. Seeing the blood of someone she knew, someone fell in front of her again. Reminding Erin of her past.

’No, it’s going to happen again, everything.. they’re going to take everything away!’ Erin thought as she gripped her sword, and dived into the enemy’s side, right in after Cindy.

’She was the one that attacked. She is the problem I need to get rid of!’ Erin thought as her anger had reached a boiling point so strong, she was crying inside to get rid of the energy that had built up.

The whole situation had been calm up until this point, that the others didn’t know what to do. While Layla, she had transformed into her serpent form, and was placing her green flames on top of Cia’s wounds, but it was doing nothing. The slash in her body had nearly gone through her. It was that strong, but it had torn everything inside with it, giving her almost an instant death.

"Cia, Cia!" Layla cried. "Come on, I lost my mother. You can’t leave me now as well!" She screamed at the top of her lungs until her throat was sore. She continued to cry and used all her energy to produce bigger green flames. Her voice was nearly torn to shreds as she continued to shout.

"Wake up! Wake Up! Who is going to help me find out about my mother? Didn’t you just remember who you are, you can’t just leave like this!"

However, there was no answer, and her eyes were lifeless, with a soft smile on her face.

Seeing Erin rushing towards Cindy, the other vampires around her started to gather, pushing her towards the back. They were clearly worried for their leader who wasn’t known for her combat abilities, but instead was known for her actual ability.

"Please, leader stay back. None of your noble vampires are here!" One of the vampires ordered.

Cindy had only brought one vampire knight along with her, along with the regular vampires from the pooling area. She didn’t bring any from her inner castle area, or from the castle itself.

Which was why the vampires were so worried about her, and at the same time were trying to make an impression, hoping to be promoted.

"Don’t hurt her too badly!" Cindy shouted, strangely concerned for Erin.

What the vampires didn’t realise, was what they were getting themselves into. It didn’t take much for Erin to beat them. All blood swipes coming towards her could be blocked with her sword, and with each strike of her own, a vampire would fall down and never get back up.

That’s when Cindy noticed something.

’Every time she strikes down a vampire, her attacks are getting faster and stronger.’

It wasn’t just her imagination either. Erin could feel it, every time she had killed a vampire, a surge of energy was increasing inside her. This was the special treat of the vampire hunter. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

’I have to get stronger, stronger!’ Erin screamed internally. No longer was she worried about herself or the others, but she was just looking at the next vampire to go after. The vampires stepped back a little, and she leapt forward, launching after them swinging her sword, when a sudden clash was heard swinging her own sword upward. It was a first in this fight where she felt her blade overpowered.

"Who did that!" she shouted.

"Don’t get consumed by your own power, Erin." A voice said.

When she finally saw who had just blocked her attack, she recognised who it was.

"Teacher!"
