Chapter 1208 One Down

After destroying the mothership's engines, the ship was slowly starting to fall from the sky. It appeared to have some type of backup system that prevented it from just crashing down, instead it floated down towards the ground. It was a shame because Quinn had been hoping that by bringing it down, they might be able to crush the Dalki camp underneath them.

'This ship will fall and crash, I'm sure since the system even said that the quest was complete, but if there is an easier way to destroy these ships, it would help out with the Quest.' Quinn also needed to make sure there was no way possible for them to easily get the thing back up and running as well.

Eventually, Yag had led Quinn and the others to a strange factory room, where the crystals were being processed even now. They had exited from the Shadow space and were busy turning their heads looking around.

"Why did you bring us to this place, and what is it?" Iree asked.

Although they were curious about the place, the others still were worrying about the fact that the ship was currently falling out of the sky at the moment. The only reason why Iree wasn't panicking was because she believed that Quinn could save them. As long as he was in his current form that is.

While looking around, the two of them had made eye contact, and a flash of Quinn's other self had appeared in her mind. It was so frightening she could feel her back starting to sweat, so the young woman quickly looked away, avoiding further eye contact.

Quinn was her saviour, but ever since she had seen him turn, the mental image was stuck in her head. Iree had even made sure her hands were wrapped, so the smell of blood wouldn't leak out and agitate him.

She didn't know that doing that was completely useless, because Quinn could smell it even then, not to mention he had already had his fill of Dalki blood, satisfying him. Should he feel a bit peckish he could always just take another sip from the flask where he had stored some of it, since it should be of help on the other planets.

"This one seems to be a factory for crystal processing." Yag tried to explain. "There are several conveyor belts that go to different places as well. One of them should be the engine room that you guys just destroyed, as for the other two we didn't really have time to check them out, but this was what we wanted to show you."

Opening two large heavy steel doors, Yag and Anna struggled to push them open, until Quinn stepped forward and used a single hand to offer them some help. The doors swung open, allowing them entry to another room, still linked to the factory.

There was a slight glow coming from the large metal containers, and non processed crystals could be seen in them. Quinn wasted no time jumping on top of them to get a closer look.

'Crystals! This whole container is filled with different grade beast crystals! Just one container seems to have as many beast crystals as the Demi-god tier beast had kept, and there are twenty containers in this room alone!' From his elevated position he could see that nearly all of them were filled up to the very top. There was only one that had been emptied, while another appeared to be in use, probably fueling the emergency system.

Moving along, Quinn quickly followed the other convey belts, learning that these crystals were being used to power certain things on the ship, not just the engines. The amount of crystals was beyond even what the Bertha ships the military had used.

The next room had a pillar in the centre, and on the top half a sphere, above which was something slightly resembling the ship. Around the room there were several glass containers filled with crystals like a dispensing candy machine.

Once one crystal was used up, the factory would quickly exchange it for another crystal, powering it all.

'This technology is far too advanced to originate from the Dalki.' Vincent could tell at a glance. 'Most of them only care about fighting and getting stronger. It almost seems impossible that any of them would have the patience to put that much time and effort into not only studying but also inventing something like this.'

'So you think all of this is Jim's doing? After all, we know that he's been helping them from the beginning.' Quinn questioned.

'It would make sense. Jim has always been clever, and with no restrictions holding him back, I wouldn't be surprised if he managed to create things that we have never seen before. If only he was on our side‚Ä¶ Quinn, we have to stop him, no matter what!'

Quinn agreed, and soon found himself walking up to the pillar and placing his hand on it. There was no reaction from him, and at a time like this he wished Logan was here.

'Wait a minute?'

Thinking about this, Quinn remembered that his system in a way did work like Logan, at least the Inspect skill did. At certain times using it when touching certain electronics or items would give him certain details.

[Inspect]

[Dalki defense system]

[Shield at 100 percent]

[Energy at 100 percent] DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

'So this is the reason why none of the attacks got through to the motherships? They are able to utilise this many crystals?'

A shield created from beast crystals was something that human ships could do as well, but the conversion rate was less than ideal, and that was being polite. The energy inside the crystals would be used up far too fast similar to how Logan used crystals with his energy blades.

'I guess if the Dalki have no other use for the crystals like we do they can use it for this purpose.' Quinn thought.

'Jim could have also invented a more efficient way for energy to be used as well.' Vincent added.

Regardless, Quinn wasn't the type of person who would be able to figure something like this out. Since it was a device located on the inside, it would be nearly impossible for anybody to destroy a Dalki mothership from the outside. Humanity simply didn't have the crystals necessary to constantly fire their lasers to compete with the Dalki reserves, especially since the latter had the better technology.

Because of this, Quinn decided that it was best to leave the place as it was. Hoping that they could use it in some way later on. Before leaving though, Quinn went back to the previous room, and withdrew all the crystals from the containers placing them in his dimensional space.

'The Dalki own half of the beast planets and have been collecting crystals for far longer than us. Only they never bothered to turn them into weapons or armour. Just with the loot of one mothership, it will help alleviate the crystal problem by a lot.'

Following the conveyor belt to one more place, Quinn had entered another room which he didn't recognise. He had assumed that since the Dalki had been created by the vampires they would have more similarities, but some of this stuff looked modern even for the current time period. There were several long stick objects, but it was clearly an invention, or machinery of some kind. Each with a large crystal on top of each of them.

Placing his hand on the device he did the same again.

[Inspect]

[Planet Jamming Array]

'So this is what causes the teleporters to stop working? At least now I know what they look like, so if it happens again we can look for it. Not every time the teleporters have been jammed has there been a mother ship along with it, so I guess they must have a mobile version of these things as well.'

For this one, Quinn was unable to leave it be, because he needed the teleporters to work. First he took out the crystals from the device, each one of them at the Emperor tier level. It looked like this device too needed a lot of energy to sustain it, which made it valuable loot.

Next he grabbed one of the strange devices and placed this in his dimensional space as well, before destroying the others.

After taking every crystal they had, Quinn was soon off form the ship. He took the others with him and with the shadow was able to create a safe landing. It looked like the Dalki who were on the ground were now unorganised and had split up in different directions, but all of them should be heading to a certain place, the Shelter!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

*BANG*

The whole ground shook violently. It felt like a giant earthquake, as items fell from shelves, just as the people who had just been standing. The good thing was that the mothership had fallen slowly so it didn't create too much of a problem, but still with its giant weight and how far it was they could feel the impact.

"He did it, he took down the Dalki mothership!" Peach screamed with excitement, witnessing what would later be recorded as the turning point in the Second Dalki War.

"Who is He? And did they really take out a Dalki mothership? How could that happen?"

"Who else could it be but Quinn, the only man deserving to be my husband?!" Helen questioned with a smile. "Maybe, he's grown so much, becoming such a big deal that he might be a bit too much for me."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This news wasn't just a good reason for the Cursed faction to celebrate though, because the news had also spread to the Earthborn faction and the Graylash faction as well.

"That kid‚Ä¶ I guess I can't call him a kid anymore, after he was able to achieve something great before us again." Owen muttered to himself with a smile

"This will be another morale boost that we can all use. It proves that the Dalki aren't invincible." Sach spoke, but both of these world leaders still had their own problems to face. Yet, they were thinking the same thing.

'I have to catch up to him.'

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The news had also managed to spread to the Dalki themselves. In particular Graham who was just walking out of another destroyed faction base. Blood splattered across his face.

'They actually managed to take down one of our motherships? I never expected them to be able to do that, much less in such a short amount of time‚Ä¶'

"Tell me exactly where the ship was taken down!" Graham ordered, be surprised that it was in their region.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Travelling back through the shadow Quinn and the others had returned to the Shelter. The celebrating news didn't last long because Helen was preparing for battle. The Dalki soldiers that were on the ground were already coming over.

Quinn quickly spat out the others from his shadow, and soon went to see Helen on top of the north wall.

"Helen, I need to ask you, are the teleporters on this planet working?" Quinn asked.

"They are working, but only on our planet. We're still unable to move to any of the other planets, because it's not working on their end." Helen clarified the situation for him. Still it was good enough all things considered.

"Helen, I did what I could for this place, but I have to move on. I trust you and your sisters to be able to deal with those from the Dalki camp. With the portals active again, prioritise the lives of the people over the Shelter, if necessary."

"I need to go to protect the rest of the Cursed planets!" Quinn said, as his body started to sink into the shadows.

"Wait Quinn, where are you going?" Helen asked.

"To get something that will help us win this fight!" Quinn answered before his head finally disappeared.
