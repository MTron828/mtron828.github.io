Chapter 908 - The second half of the tale

Although the tale Leo and Silver had told so far was amazing and beyond what they could have ever imagined, it didn’t explain what Silver meant by her words, saying that Bryce wouldn’t attack and how something bigger was on the horizon.

Little did they know that this was because it was only the first half of their story and there was still a lot to go from when they had returned.

It was explained further by Ham that when they had moved to the Familiar World they had also moved from the position they had entered as well. Although the Boneclaw could have gone back, and opted a portal up there time wasn’t on their side.

If two more energy balls were to escape from their bodies, then it would possibly be life threatening. As such they had no choice but to go through the portal that had been created and hope for the best. The Vampire World was not exactly the smallest, so they could only rely on luck to end up somewhere near the Vampire settlement.

Going through the portal only took a few seconds, and when they arrived it was as expected. They were in the forest but there was nothing resembling where they had come from, and nothing to tell where they had ended up.

"I feel different. Oh, his Majesty, the Boneclaw king is no longer with me!" Ham shouted as he flapped his wings, happy to be free. The rest couldn’t share his enthusiasm.

"But didn’t that Boneclaw protect us?" Fex pointed out the reason for their disgruntlement. "If we run into that vampire again from last time, it will be really difficult for us. We can’t escape."

"I don’t think the Boneclaw would have been able to help us a second time in any case." Leo stated. "It must have used up a lot of energy creating those two portals, otherwise it would have returned with us."

"So is that the last time we will see that thing?" Nate asked.

Truthfully, Leo didn’t know, but he had a feeling it would be the last time. There had to be a reason why such a powerful being wanted to stay in the Human World, and it hadn’t really appeared to be the type to help them out of the kindness of its soul.

’Finally! How long has it been since I have been here?’ The cat purred inside of Leo’s mind. ’It’s so rare to find someone with your quality of Qi, no wonder that Bonehead had stayed here for so long. I’d love to taste some, but I will leave it alone for now. I don’t want you dying in the middle of nowhere, since you might need your strength.’

Silver, who had been carrying the large casket on her back the whole time, placed it on the ground, and opened it up. She was worried that their little captive might have been damaged when they had gone to the other world, but she was wriggling about tied up showing full well she still had strength.

Still, the others could tell that the energy inside her had also been s.u.c.k.e.d away. All of them were currently weaker and not at full fighting strength,

Using what they could, Ham flew up high in the sky and tried to tell the others what he could see. Silver had done some exploration in the past, so if they spotted some sort of landmark maybe they could find their way out.

"Mountains, smaller mountains, scary looking mountains." Ham kept naming them all as he saw them.

"Anything else, Ham?!" Fex shouted from below.

"Did I already mention the mountains? Hang on, there is something there.." Ham corrected himself as he noticed something else a little behind a mountain. Flying back down, Ham delivered the news.

He first described the different types of mountains but nothing seemed to give Silver any idea of their current location, except for the next thing the flying bull described.

"It looked like a giant dome created from the ground, but the centre of it was all cracked. It didn’t look natural, that’s all I’m saying." Ham reported.

The group needed to make a decision, head towards the stage man built object, or split up in different directions to return to the centre once they had found something.

"Split up? Did none of you guys ever watch any movies?" Nate complained. "If we split up, they’ll get killed off one by one and knowing my luck I’ll end up being the first one!"

Hearing Nate speak out about it, while they didn’t think it would be as drastic as he had described, they decided against splitting up and with no better idea they headed towards the dome. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

While on the way, Nate would constantly try and get in contact back at the base, but now it seemed like everyone in their base was currently busy all at the same time. It just made them feel tense about the situation, and rush forward.

Leo placed his hand out against the top part of the dome, and made a sign for the whole group to stop.

"I can sense vampires."

"All the way out here, in the middle of nowhere? But it makes no sense we aren’t even close to the waterfall?" Silver wondered.

"But that original vampire guy didn’t come from the waterfall!" Fex argued. "He had to have come from somewhere else, right? What if this is where they’re hiding right now?"

Leo was quite confident that it wasn’t the case, at least that the man they had met before wasn’t here. Somehow he had known where they were, and Leo wondered if it had anything to do with their prisoner.

"Make sure, she doesn’t hear or see anything." Leo warned, and soon the Vampire’s knight’s ears were plugged up with cotton balls made of string as well.

With Leo’s ability, he should be able to sense anyone else before they sensed them. The group decided to continue forwards with Silver being the most keen.

Hearing what Fex had said, just made her want to find out if it was true or not. She wanted to bring back as much information as possible as they could.

Using Leo’s ability, they took a path that would Delbert avoid the vampires that seen. However, foolowing them as they got closer to the dome they needed to follow them from behind.

Finally, they could see the crater in front of them, but were unable to see what was inside from the top. They could see two female vampires, holding a male vampire walking towards the dome.

"Hey, is it just me or does it look like they’re treating that man like a prisoner?" Nate asked.

It was true, they could see that both the females were practically dragging the male vampire by his arms, as if he had been passed out and his legs dragging on the floor.

"What is this place? They’re wearing the castle uniform, so they must be from the settlement, but were nowhere near the settlement." Silver said.

When they entered the dome, the door they had gone through closed behind them, and the way Silver was shuffling her feet it was clear she wanted to follow them inside.

"After what we encountered last time, we need to be more careful. Especially with the state we’re in." Leo cautioned, closing his eyes as he spread his ability one more time, to get an idea of what was inside the strange place.

Straight away, Leo could sense multiple auras, many of them similar but at the same time a lot of them different, and it wasn’t just a few, there were more auras then that at the Bloodsucker base in the waterfall.

However, something was strange about them, some felt weak and weren’t moving about much.

"What did you see?" Silver asked.

Leo explained what he could see, and the others couldn’t really figure it out much either.

"So, there isn’t anyone strong that we can’t take on in there?" Nate asked.

Leo nodded, but it looked like he had one more thing on his mind he wanted to say.

"About one of the auras I felt, it was exactly the same as one of the auras at the tenth castle. Someone inside has the same aura as Alex."
