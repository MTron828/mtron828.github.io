Before Chris and the demon king started to battle head to head, Hikel had displayed his newly found powers, mixing in his blood with his absolute blood control. He had created fist sized blood balls that came raining down on the enemy werewolves and blew up the entire area. 

It was filled with smoke for a few moments. When the smoke started to settle, there was one person in particular who had come out wielding both axes by the side of his head. 

"Tell me, what did you guys do to Hinto!" Shinto shouted at the top of his lungs, as he swung the axe towards the vampire. He quickly shifted and moved out of the way. He saw an opening and Hikel struck four times in one at his side. 

The hits were heavy, filled with great power as red aura could be seen coming out from the other side, but Shinto's body was completely solid, and it hadn't even moved him. It was a surprise for Hikel.  Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

One of the axes swung from the top, heading towards Hikel's head. 

'This Chrono, he's fast, just as fast as me. It's no wonder he was the only person that was guarding that place. It's because he was the only one needed, he would have been able to get rid of all the Chrono by himself if need be.' 

Raising both of his hands, his palm open, red aura spread out, and exploded with force. It sent Hikel back and the axe back as well. The two skidded across the floor. Using his explosion powers so close was still bad for him, and burn marks could be seen on his face. 

Thankfully, he could heal small wounds like that, and his skin was going back to the way it used to be. From his right though, suddenly a large claw came right at him. It was a werewolf claw. 

Immediately Hikel grabbed the wrist, but could feel the great strength behind the werewolf. 

'These werewolves, they are a lot stronger than the ones I faced in the past.'

Looking at the werewolf, Hikel noticed something that was even stranger, and that was the limbs that were on its body. They had stretched out from the open flesh that could be seen. 

The muscles had extended and now the arm was almost twice as long. Never had he seen a werewolf do something like this before, and Hikel could only imagine it was due to the influence of the power from Unzoku that he had used on them. 

Still, he didn't have much time to think about what was happening, as other werewolves were jumping towards him from another side. Lifting up his leg he let out a side kick, and a ball of blood aura left his foot. 

It slammed into the werewolf's chest and exploded sending it flying back.

'My attack from before, it managed to damage most of the werewolves, but they're just healing. Thankfully the wounds were quite deep, so not all of them are in the condition to fight just yet, but for only two of them to die after my attack. Fighting against them and the champion is going to be extremely difficult.' 

Hikel could already see that Shinto had lifted his axe, and was charging up with a large strike. 

"You damn celestials, why would you take him from me!" Shinto screamed and slammed his axe on the floor. 

Still holding onto the other werewolf's wrist, Hikel had no choice, he used his aura and let off another explosion at close contact. The werewolf's entire claw was destroyed and fell off from its wrist, while it fell on its back. 

Hikel's own hand wasn't in good condition either as it was extremely bloody.

'The whole point of getting the blood control skill was so I didn't have to use my powers at such a close range and suffer from the blow back, but here I am being forced into these situations!' 

With two open palms again, Hikel started to move them in a circle motion and created two large circles of red aura, he then pushed it forward, and two vortex's of blood aura went right towards the axe strike. 

As it hit, they both collided and the red aura exploded giving it an extra boost of power. However, it wasn't enough and the axe strike continued. The axe strike had hit Hikel right in the chest. Creating a large deep cut diagonally across his chest. 

Behind Hikel on the wall, the same large diagonal strike was seen, with a small gap where Hikel's body had hit the strike. 

"F*ck!" Hikel grabbed his chest as blood splattered out and onto the ground. The strike hadn't gone right through him, but it was a large and deep cut that would take a while to heal.  I think you should take a look at

"I'm glad you didn't die from that, because I have so many things I want to ask you damned celestials!" Shinto said. 

Hikel thought for a second about denying being a celestial, trying to talk his way out of the situation, but he wasn't really in a position to do that, and it didn't look like the champion would be willing to listen to him either.

'The beings on this planet, this Champion, that demon king, this isn't even Immortui that we are going up against.' Hikel thought. 'I can't believe it, for how long did vampires feel they had the right to rule because they were on top of the food chain? 

'If they saw this, those stubborn vampires would quickly realise how over their heads they really are. I think I might even be in over my head for this one. We are meant to help Quinn, how the heck are we meant to do that, when we're dying right now!'

Even after receiving a big blow, there was no time to recover. After Shinto had done such a large attack, now six of the werewolves had leapt up in the air, and were heading right for Hikel. 

"You mutts, you were always good at striking when you sensed a moment of weakness." Hikel said

Blood aura had been gathering in his hands, and as it condensed it started to take shape. It wasn't a completely solid form like a sword, instead it was flexible.

'I don't like using creations that have been made by leaders of the past, but I haven't had time to come up with my own yet, so I'm just going to have to borrow this for now!'

In both of Hikel's hands were two blood whips, he swung them out, hitting the werewolves across their chest, and as they hit explosions went off, sending them away, but he wasn't just going to swing it once, Hikel continued to swing the whips. 

While doing so, lines of blood aura would come out through the end. So even if the blood whip wasn't hitting them directly, the aura could be sent out, and with Hikel's power, large explosions were going off hitting the werewolves one after the other.

The red strikes also went toward Shinto, who would swing his axes hitting them and breaking them apart. Although he broke the aura, he was unable to stop the blood explosion ability. 

Each time he used his axe to break the several red axe strikes, he was being hit by the explosions one after the other. Yet, he still looked absolutely fine, his body was intact, not suffering from these small attacks at all.

"Something like this wouldn't have been able to take out my brother!" Shinto shouted. 

———-

Elsewhere on the battlefield, the werewolf that had been hit by Hikel's explosion earlier, was just about to get up. To his side, though there was a large purple circle on the ground. From underneath a hand reached out, and went right through the werewolf. 

A hand held onto the heart of the werewolf and soon flames started to melt the heart until there was nothing there.

'It seems like both of them are losing, whether I like it or not, I might have to join this thing and turn the tides. For now though, I'll continue taking these guys out one by one, while no one notices me.' Russ thought.
