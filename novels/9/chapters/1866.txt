Chapter Ôªø1867 Quinn is alive?

From the outside, an ample bright white light appeared in the shape of a large sphere, and it continued to enlarge until it had consumed Quinn, Sil, and Ceril as well. As soon as it reached them, all three suddenly disappeared, as if they were never there.

At the same time, it looked like Yongu and Yanny had also disappeared. With an agreement to never return to this planet again, of course, unless they came as an ally.

"Good luck, my dear sister. I can only imagine the number of stories you will have to tell me when you return." Wince said with a big smile on her face while looking up at the sky.

"What will you two do now? You are free to stay here for as long as you like since you have also played a crucial part in helping us reclaim our planet." Wince turned to her side.

"You really believe that?" Doguth replied. "Think back to what they did. Both of them. At any point and time, it felt like that guy named Sil could have defeated the strong Predators of the planet. He also returned your previous King's trident, which you used to defeat Yanny, but he could have used that himself as well.

"Their strength is beyond what they have revealed, and I think your God's reaction proved that."

It was true, and thinking more about it, Wince came to believe the same. In fact, if Quinn wasn't afraid of water or Wince didn't insist on going to the vault, they could have solved the matter far earlier. However, whatever the reasons, this had allowed them and their planet to grow, as well as herself. With the power given to her by Quinn, she could now face the outside threats that Yanny was so scared off.

"That doesn't change the fact that both of you chose to help when you didn't need to. I was merely a passenger on the Marpo Cruise. You did say it was for revenge, but the reason doesn't matter. You, and anyone from your Cruise, are free to stay here whenever they wish." Wince declared.

It was a nice offer, and Doguth didn't say anything else. And soon, he and Nog prepared to leave via spaceship to head back.

Once the ship left the planet and they entered space, looking at the water-covered planet, Doguth was thinking about something.

'It would be better if the others never found out about this place.'

The two soon got in contact with the Marpo cruise. They assumed that the repairs would be completed by now. As for what they would need to do, it was hard to say. If they could, they would love to just go back on the ship and do what they had been doing before: Travelling the Universe while stopping on board fights every now and again.

That's when they received quite a shocking message.

"Headquarters wants you both back here as soon as possible." The voice on the other end said, "Several reports have come in from the other passengers and staff, but they want to speak to you two directly since it has been said that you left with some passengers."VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

Nog wanted to complain back, wondering why they cared so much. It wasn't like they had left with the attackers of the ship, but Doguth gave the reply in the end.

"We will be there as soon as possible."

It took quite a while for them to travel through the vast Universe and, after about a week, to finally find a nearby-by cruise ship. They soon entered it and teleported themselves to the Marpo Headquarters.

The Marpo Headquarters was located on a deserted planet. There were no signs of life here, not even beasts, but the planet was gigantic, around the same size as Jupiter in the Solar System. Because of that, it was rich in minerals that could be used to build things reactively easily, like the giant cruise ships that flew from planet to planet.

Those in its galaxy abandoned the planet due to the lack of life. And also because there was the reason why there was no such life in the first place. There was no water, and no plants on this planet, meaning they would have to terraform the whole place to colonise this planet, and that was a long and arduous task.

Yet, somehow, the owner of the Marpo Cruise came out of nowhere and could do such a thing. Although it was a hard task to change the planet, it wasn't impossible if using resources from the nearby races and other planets.

This was why it had come as such a shock to other civilisations because one had succeeded in doing such a thing. It was as if someone had breathed life into the planet within one night, and now it was home to one of the most well-known companies in the Universe.

Exiting the teleporter, Doguth and Nog found themselves in a station. It was not accessed to the public, but instead one that the engineers would use.

It was a gigantic space, and the two couldn't even see the other end of this area. Around them, the mechanic staff were working on one of the large cruise ships. Some of them also looked like Nog, and many who didn't. However, they all had one thing in common: a humanoid figure.

"Why couldn't they just set up the teleporter to take us to the main base?" Nog asked, already getting tired of all the walking they would have to do to reach their destination.

"Because it's a risk, and you know it. The enemies can kill the Board members immediately if they get in there." Doguth replied as the two continued walking, looking for an exit.

They continued to watch the surroundings and soon saw a large metal panel around 30 metres wide carried by a single person. However, a person wasn't the right word because this figure was just as large as Doguth and had a tail like him because he was also a Dalki.

As they walked past, three spikes could be seen protruding out of the Dalki's back. That wasn't the only Dalki either. Moving around were a few more, spread far and in between, doing manual labour and building large spaceships that would be used for the Cruise line.

It wasn't a new site for the two of them, so they weren't too bothered by it. After finding an exit, the pair went into a tunnel that pulled them through a see-through shuttle. It took them outside, where they could see the planet's surface. The entire place was now practically a jungle, a vast difference from how the planet originally was.

All of the habitable areas were large enclosed facilities, just like the one they had come out from. This was to not disrupt the ongoing projects that were still going on throughout the planet, although the two didn't really know more details regarding this matter.

Eventually, the shuttle took a sharp turn, and they were now heading to a building encased in a complete black hard material. The headquarters where the Board Members lived. The very top of the building was in the shape of a semicircle sticking out with a large glass that allowed one to overlook all of the giant buildings in place, and that was exactly where the two of them were heading.

Nog was extremely nervous, as for Doguth, not so much since he had been here before. Inside the headquarters, all Nog could see were other Dalki, and with an elevator taking the two to the top floor, they were allowed to enter the large room.

Upon stepping out, they noticed several things in the hall, but a large desk and a chair facing away from them at the very end, next to a window. They noticed a pair of legs touching the floor and deduced someone was sitting on it.

At the same time, standing by the desk were two huge Dalki.

"I called you after we received an interesting report, but it seems the two of you were away during that time. Did you have fun?" The male voice came from behind the chair.

"I forwarded the report, sir. You have always allowed Captains to have a level of free will, and since these people were brave enough to attack the cruise ship, I thought I should teach them a lesson." Doguth answered.

"Very good." The man replied although it was hard to judge his thoughts based on his voice. "I hope this means the planet is destroyed and we should never have the same problem again. However, there was something else I heard as well, and I wish to confirm with you whether it was true or not. Is it true that there were two humans onboard the ship?

"As you know, I have a great interest in it myself, so if there is anything at all that you could tell me about them, that would be certainly helpful, and please do remember that I can tell if you choose to lie."

One of the Dalki began to walk forward, and a slight change in his eyes was seen. Seeing this, Doguth said everything about the humans that they had seen.

"I see." The man paused. "And the name of this black-haired person, do you remember it?"

"I believe‚Ä¶he was called Quinn," Doguth replied.

"Hm? Quinn‚Ä¶ that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. But isn't he dead?"
