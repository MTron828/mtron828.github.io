Majestic Desert Splendor
0.00 / 0.00

After meeting up with the Green family, they had a plan in place. They were a lot more confident moving around the ship, as well as heading to the right location, because the mastermind that was behind it all, was none other than Logan.

With him on their side, he could change cameras, turn off sensors, and work his magic behind the scenes. On top of all that, they were now with Jake as well. He had specially prepared a special power that could be used to cloak the others, and that's what they had done.

Their footsteps would still make sound, and if they crashed into someone their bodies would still touch, but at a glance, most would be unable to see them. Although there were other ways to be found out.

Because of all of this, the group couldn't always run to the location they needed to. Although at times, they did use Shiro's teleportation powers to move between floors when they checked the area was clear.

"It's a good thing we have you guys, this place is huge and like a maze, have we been moving around for hours?" Russ stated.

"Just a reminder, that my power only keeps you invisible, it doesn't block the noise coming out of your mouth." Jake stated, shaking his head.

"Still, he has a point, how are they even able to move people through the place with this many people." Stark asked.

"It's because the ship used to be a Cruise Ship for all races. It has everything in here."Ceril answered, remembering the time her and her sister were on one of these. "But I agree, I have no idea how they can get an army through this thing."

"Only one part of the ship is used." Vicky answered. "You have to remember that they know when a battle is going to take place beforehand, so it's easy to organise everything."

After a few hours of going around the place, the situation had changed as they were starting to see many Dalki inside. The group had to stay silent.

The Dalki were with the humans running to different places, monitoring equipment and a number of things, but what they also noticed was the fact that there were a lot of high Spiked Dalki that were still on the ship.

It worried them about what was to come, but in the end, as long as their plan worked, then it meant that the humans that were on board would be on their side.

Eventually, they continued to travel and next to no one questioned Vicky or Jake. They were well known by the Dalki and the humans as well.

Heading down to the lower floors of the ship, they were now coming across a mostly empty area. There was next to no one in the area. Now there was one long hallway and a large thick door straight up ahead.

Standing by the door, there were two Dalki, and both of them were with five spikes.

As the group got closer and closer, they were trying to control their heart beat, trying to stay as silent as possible.

Dalki didn't have advanced senses like that of the vampires, but who knew if their senses improved with spikes or not.

"Halt!" One of the Dalki shouted, while the group were still ten metres away. "Only those that travel with Jack are allowed down here."

"Ah yes‚Ä¶ I am Jake." Jake answered.

"You stupid fool, I said Jack, not Jake‚Ä¶are you Jack?" The Dalki asked.

"I am Jake." Jake answered.

The two Dalki turned to look at each other, and at that moment Vicky shouted.

"Now!"

The cloak had come off, and everyone rushed forward. Beforehand, they had decided to use everything they had, to take out the Dalki as quickly as possible. Jake, combined his powers having a glowing like lava hand.

Minny had transformed into her celestial form, Russ had used his powers to turn into a Dalki five spike just like them. Everyone else went to use the strongest move in their arsenal, all of them were strong, and all of them aimed right for the head.

The Dalki were too slow to act, and the power, all of the attack force in one area was immense, so immense that the two of them died on the spot. When the bodies fell over, with not much of a head to look at, nearly all of them were breathing heavily.

Not because they were tired, but it was out of nerves.

"With all of us, we managed to kill the two five Spike Dalki, so easily." Layla siad.

Remembering just how much of a force they were to be reckoned with in the past, but they had all improved greatly in strength, and there were allies here that they didn't have last time.

On top of that, there was also the fact that the Dalki was unable to use its trait of getting stronger the more it was injured, due to the amount of power in their attacks.

"Alright, the good news is, this place is so far down, that even though we made that much noise they shouldn't have heard anything, now it's time to get onto the next part." Jake said.

Lifting up his arm, there was a spider, hopping around, it jumped up and down, and it knew what it needed to do. The sound of the large door unlocking was heard. Several large mechanisms were heard, and finally the door started to split apart opening slowly.

A few seconds felt like hours to them, as they waited for the door to open and to see what was on the other side. Then when it finally opened, everyone took a step inside, looking up at what they could see.

They were in a large oval room. One that was large enough to perhaps fit a 1000 people inside, yet it was completely empty, apart from one person that was in the centre.

There was a pillar-like mechanism, a machine that went up, and then a ball-like shape with an outer glass. Inside, they could see Sil, he was stretched out, wires digging into his back, and cuffed up by the ankle and the wrists.

At the same time, he was currently asleep, he wasn't conscious and there were no signs of him waking up.

"That's the person we've been looking for right, that's the one we came here for?" Stark asked.

"Yes." Shiro said as he reached out, feeling guilty, guilty that he wasn't strong enough to stop this from happening. Sil didn't look the same as he remembered last time. His body frame was smaller.

It was almost as if they were draining him of everything and only giving him enough for him to survive.

"Why‚Ä¶ does he look so‚Ä¶ is he okay?" Ceril asked.

"Its a solution." Jake explained. "Jack, gives him a solution that keeps him asleep. It's being fed into him right at this moment. When they want to use him, then the solution stops, and the one known as Malik is usually here as well.

"There is a good chance that his memory has also been Altered. So there are two things that we have to worry about. The first, is when he wakes up, we have to be ready for anything.

"And the second, is if you want him to change the memories back, if you want him to use his powers, we need to keep him in the machine. Without it, he will only have the power to remove one person's memory at at time."

The others nodded as they heard this, they knew it was risky, but Shiro believed that Sil was strong, strong enough that he wouldn't be affected by a memory change, or at least have a contingency for it not to affect him.

Jake looked at the small spider once again.

"Logan, remove the solution, and we'll just have to wait for Sil to wake up." Jake stated.

One of the tubes that were going into Sil, the liquid that could be seen started to stop, and a few seconds later, a loud alarm was heard all over.

The little spider started to project an image and Logan was there.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

"Everyone, the alarm has been triggered. Jack must have set up some safety measures if anything happened to Sil. I disabled all the systems that I could find, but he must have the server remote from the ship. This is my fault, but there is nothing we can do now.

"They know you are here!"
