[Limitless]

[When all pieces of the first God Slayer Armour set are worn together, it will have the Limitless effect. All pieces of equipment individually will have limitless stats.]

It was because of this explanation that Quinn had originally thought the set effect of this wasn't too much to write home about, but he knew that maybe it was more so due to the fact that he didn't really understand it.

That was when he started to look into detail a bit more. Checking out the equipment, just as the system stated, he could see that they all had this passive effect Limitless. When seeing this he noticed something else as well, and that was the fact that the equipment had no stats.

Even demon tier equipment would have a stat figure placed next to it, giving Quinn an idea of what were the strengths and weaknesses of each equipment, but here there was none.

Of course, currently stats didn't matter too much. The stats were just a boost to one's physicality, and there were now multiple energies that Quinn went against that could bypass the realms of normality. Celestial energy for one.

Still, It didn't explain much so he decided to do a little test. He only wore one piece of equipment and decided to check out the stats again, and this time he could see the system had an error sign, with a little (i) icon next to it.

[The system is unable to determine the value of this piece of equipment]

Trying this test for all of the pieces, he noticed that they all said the same thing.

'The system can't tell the value. Does that mean the stats that it gives, are beyond the system's understanding. But if that's the case, that's the value without the set boost. If we take the word limitless, doesn't that mean, as a set, the power is even stronger, to the point where it can't be measured?'

It was hard for Quinn to think, to really imagine what it meant, but the only thing he could imagine was‚Ä¶ what if someone who had no strength at all was to wear this armour? If the system's words were right, then one just wearing the armour would have limitless power.

He imagined they would be stronger than most god slayers, celestials, and could even defeat demon tier beasts, but not just anyone had the armour, he did.

It was at that point that Quinn perhaps realised something. He had travelled with Mundus to fight some of the strongest God Slayers in existence and managed to beat them. He was already one of the strongest in the universe.

Now though, with the armour set, he was at the pinnacle and there would only be a few that could maybe hope to challenge him now.

Regardless, he would have to put this limitless power to the test, as he felt like he was also going up against someone with limitless power. With the armour it would at least put him and his opponent on similar grounds, but even then there were still more things the armour could do.

The first piece of equipment that Quinn had made were his God Slayer boots. It was the first opponent he had gone against. It was hard for him to say which opponent was the most difficult as they all gave him different struggles.

The first thing that Quinn noticed was the fact that there were more than one set of skills and this was for the boots alone.

[Passive Skill: Silent steps]

[The user who wears these boots will never make a sound as they move. No matter how fast or slow.]

When fighting, a person relied a lot on their senses and that included hearing. For a vampire that had enhanced hearing they used it a lot to track if someone was following them or near them.

Although the skill didn't sound all impressive when put together with Quinn's speed. He could leave situations with many unable to track him.

At the same time, whether it was thanks to the set ability or not, wearing all of the armour, he felt no slower than when he was using the Blue Fang set which just focused on speed.

[Flight steps]

[The User is able to step on air when using the boots. They can rise and fall, and the speed will be determined by the user's speed.]

The active skill didn't have a cooldown time, nor did it seem to run out. It was practically a piece of equipment that gave an ability to one. What Quinn liked about it though, was that it wasn't an ability similar to flight.

With flight one had to use it in strange ways, they didn't move their feet or would have to rely on wings of some sort. With this, Quinn could just run across the air as if he was fighting on the ground.

[The user is able to make a total of three clones of themselves at one time. The clones are limited to 50 percent of the user's natural power. The clones are not durable]

Quinn already had the shadow clones that worked in a similar way. The problem was, his clones were unable to attack, they were more used as decoys. Although these could be used the same way, these clones were also able to attack.

The monkey man he had faced could produce more than three clones, but this was equipment made from his powers, rather than the god slayer himself.

All of these active skills were from a single piece of equipment and there was a lot more to go.

The next piece of equipment that Quinn had worked on in the forgery was the chest piece. In the end, the chest piece had been made alongside the shoulder guards, but with a focus on the chest piece since it covered the largest part on Quinn's body.

Due to how much material was going to be made, two God Slayer crystals had been used. The phoenix crystal, and the Behemoth crystal.

Just like with the boots, there was more than one skill for the item. However, it seemed like because they were made with the shoulder guards, that the skills were together, and would only work if the two pieces were used together.

In a way, the shoulder and chest piece had to be treated as one item.

[Sunfire Burn]

[An extreme heat with traits similar to the sun will be activated, dealing damage to those in the nearby area.]

Without using the skill, it was hard to know just how extreme the heat would be, but if it was anything like what Quinn had experienced going against the phoenix, he imagined that it would do well when fighting against multiple opponents.

[Indestructible shell]

[This skill can be used once per month. The skill allows the armour to become indestructible for ten seconds.]

This item reminded Quinn a lot of an item he used to have, the indestructible sword. The item didn't have good stats, but because of its trait there were multiple times when he could use it in a fight that helped him out.

Quinn was sure that with its stats in the first place that the armour would be pretty much indestructible, but if a large attack had the chance of finishing him off, it was a good safety move to have. Which made sense why it had a long cool down time.

Finally, there was the last skill of the chest piece, and once again, he was looking at something he had never seen before. With this new armour the system was showing him new things.

[A new flame]

[You have not met the requirements to use this skill]

Other than that, the system gave him no more information. Quinn tried to use the armour on its own, taking other pieces away, but the requirements still had yet to be met. The skills so far all followed a similar trait to the crystals they were made with, so it made him have some ideas, but still, one of the skills on the armour for now were locked.

With that, it left two more pieces of god slayer equipment that made up the God Slayer Armour set.
