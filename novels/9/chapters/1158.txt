Chapter 1159 Solving both

It was time for Quinn to make the decision. However, it wasn’t quite as black and white as some people thought it might be. As he looked over at Sil he could see a smile on his face swinging his legs like a little kid. Ever since being on this mission, his mood had brightened up. Now that he was so close to achieving the goal, if they failed, or it got delayed any longer, then perhaps Sil would snap.

Although Quinn could control him and face him somewhat, it wasn’t something he wanted to do.

Sil had waited long enough already. On top of that, the military would most likely just kill the beast instead of capturing it unless Quinn made a request.

’Now that our relationship has improved with Longblade, maybe if we ask, he will agree. Still, his number one property has to be to get rid of it?’ Quinn thought.

Looking at Layla and everyone there, the worry deep frown on her face, he knew what the right decision was to be.

"You don’t have to worry, Layla. Remember both groups will be together, just both have different tasks." Quinn replied. "It’s not like we’re splitting up or anything. Well, try to do both." At that moment, Quinn wanted to comfort her. His hand reached out for hers, but before even touching, a strange feeling had come over him.

’Again? But before, we could touch just fine, but now it feels like that stupid connection thing is coming up again! Why does it only activate sometimes?’ Quinn thought.

Standing up, Quinn walked over to where Longblade was and was ready with his answer.

"We will take care of the Pure group. However, I would like to make some requests." Quinn said. "I know your group has already done a lot for us, even allowing us to come along, but the Cursed faction needs the Demi-god tier beast. We need it alive."

Hearing this, Joy thought this Bucky person was crazy. Why would they agree to capture the beast alive? Not just that, there was a double meaning to this request. If they were asking this, it also meant they wanted to keep the Demi-god tier beast as well. Since the military had no use for it alive apart from its crystal.

"I would like to put Sil on your team. I’m sure you know about his powers." Quinn said. "He will be strong enough to allow your group to subdue the demi-god tier beast alive. In return, whatever you need from the Cursed faction, we will comply."

Although Sil was unstable at times, Quinn could rely on one thing, and that was his power. Knowing how important this job was for him, Sil would make sure it would happen by putting it in his hands.

He could see that Layla would go for the Pure members, and Sil would go for the beast no matter what. So in his head, it was who needed more help. Still, if he finished one job quickly, he could help out the other as well.

Longblade paused for a few seconds, not giving an answer. While he looked at his people and the others.

"The Demi-god tier beast has hurt a lot of our people. They will be upset to hear that the creature is in the Cursed group’s hands, and a Demi-god tier weapon would greatly improve our group’s strength. Especially a humanoid one. Whatever you give in return will need to be of equal value or greater." Longblade said. "Do you have the authority to promise us this?"

Without hesitating at all, Quinn replied.

"Yes, I do."

The largest grin had appeared on Longblade’s face after hearing the answer.

"Then we agree, but I will not force my people to keep the beast alive. If they are in danger, they are to protect their lives most of all. I will also not be responsible for looking after the Blade boy."

Longblade had heard from Oscar, who precisely this boy was, and how strong his powers were. It was a story many of them found hard to believe, but since the report came from Oscar, they had no choice but to.

"Of course," Quinn said.

At that moment, Longblade leaned over.

"I hope this can improve our relationship, Quinn," Longbalde whispered and walked off to his people to make sure everyone was ready.

Hearing this, Quinn had a look on his face of disbelief. He didn’t understand how Longbalde had found out. His disguise was perfect.

’Of course, he would find out who you were.’ Vincent said. ’Who else would have the authority to give something of equal value as a Demi-god tier crystal. You didn’t even hesitate or ask for an okay from the others.’

It was a slip up, but Longblade must have had his suspicions after the match.

They entered the underground tunnels, and the vehicle they were in was starting to slow down. Eventually, it had come to a complete stop, and two giant mechs were seen standing by the vehicle as well as two more guards. Their duty was to protect that underground station.

Getting off from the vehicle, it was quite impressive what they could see. It wasn’t a tunnel like they had imagined. The walls were far wider than they could reach. It could fit at least four or more of the vehicles they had come in; it was so wide.

The walls were also filled with white lights that would go across the edges, making it easy for all of them to see. The only thing that felt like they were underground was the flooring. However, even that was flattened out for them to walk on.

"As we mine, we also continue to resurface the place and make improvements," Longblade explained. "The planet is full of sinkholes that one can’t really travel on the surface. So we thought of moving the Shelter underground and travelling via the vehicles when needed. The above Shelter will remain as a storage place for the crystals." Long Blade explained. After that, he pulled out his katana blade and walked forward.

"It’s time to head to the mining area where the beast was last seen." Longblade ordered. The groups split into two and started to walk side by side. Quinn out front with his group, and Rafer standing out front for Longblade’s group. He was a large, powerful man that looked like a tank. A person who wouldn’t fall easy, so it made sense to put him out there.

Meanwhile, in the tunnels themselves, in an area that wasn’t as well done up as where Quinn and his group had arrived from. There was agent number 2.

"Alright, this time I’ll be moving out by myself. I’m sick and tired of staying in this underground place. We have news that they have called for help from the Cursed faction, but no one of significance has arrived. We need to deal with this before even more help is on the way."

———

After walking for a while, they came across the mining area where blue crystals completely lit up the wall. It was a big area, and even looking up, they couldn’t tell where the ceiling was. Yet, they had built machinery to help them extract the crystal from up high. It was as if they wouldn’t let a single crystal go to waste.

Looking around, it didn’t seem like the beast was here. They could only see destroyed machinery and a few parts that had fallen off from the mechs earlier.

Just then, Longblade received a message.

"Everyone, the beast has been spotted in area C. That is one of the areas where the beasts are located, hurry let’s head back to the vehicle. We can catch up with it then. Otherwise, it might get away before we get to it."

"Longblade, is there another way to get to the beast other than using those vehicles?" Quinn asked as they were running back. Once they reached the station, they could use another one to take them to the area they were heading in.

Longblade then pointed to a hole in the tunnel back the way they were. It wasn’t carved out properly since it was a natural tunnel and not one created by them.

"If it’s in area C, it means it must have used that tunnel to reach it, but we wouldn’t get there in time. There is another reason why we had to come to this area first. I don’t know how, but I think it can sense when we arrive at the last area. "

"Only then does the beast move to another area, so it must have just arrived at Area C. We have only recently been using vehicles. Even then, we are only managing to catch it on the tail end just as it’s in the middle of fighting the last beast."

Hearing all of this, Quinn knew what he needed to do, a way for him to solve both of the problems from earlier. All he had to do was capture the Demi-god tier beast before Pure arrived.

"You guys go ahead. I’ll meet you there!" Quinn shouted, turning back around and running the opposite way.

Longbalde wanted to ask what he was doing, but there was no time to waste. If they didn’t get to the vehicle now, they might miss the beast. Or worse, Pure would arrive before them.

So far, they had been arriving at the exact same time. It was a race.

When everyone finally left, Quinn activated the shadow putting on the beast gear set that shined a great silver with blue.
