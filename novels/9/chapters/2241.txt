Stark had overstayed his welcome by the wall, he had slowly been moving along with the rest of them to see if there was anything else he could hear or find out, since the information he had received so far wasn't too bad.

At the same time he didn't want to stay away for too long from Sil.

'Could you imagine, the moment I decide to go out, that guy finally wakes up, and I'm sure if he did, he would be really confused.' Stark thought.

Turning around, he was looking at his path, he just needed to run through an alleyway and take a right in one blast and he would be fine. That was until a shadow from above was cast over him.

"What's this, I thought I could smell something fresh." The Dalki said. "It looks like one of them is still alive on this planet after all. This will make our job a lot easier."

Stark didn't say anything, he didn't think of a witty response or any of the sort, and had just decided to run. He zapped through the alleyway and took a left turn and now he was down another street.

'That should be okay right? After seeing my speed, and seeing how I can out run them. They won't bother to chase after me.' Stark thought.

A moment later, crashing through the wall of one of the houses, was the Dalki. Its eyes were focused, its tongue was hanging out from its mouth. With its feet it skidded across the floor, and had its eyes locked on.

'This Dalki is a three spike, I could probably take it on my own. The armour I'm wearing does give me extra strength after all, but there were four Dalki, and three human fighters as well. I'm not sure if I could take out one quick enough before the others arrive and I don't know their abilities.'

With all of these thoughts running through his head, seeing the Dalki leap toward him, Stark decided to run.

He ran and ran, continuing to go through the city. Everything was passing him like a blur, and before he knew it, he had reached the very edge where the wall was.

"Alright, this should do. I don't think they will have any idea where I am right now?" Stark said out loud and waited a few moments.

He was worried any second now, Dalki were going to come popping out from the houses nearby, but that never happened.

'Maybe I should just check something out.'

Stark picked one of the destroyed houses, there weren't many left that were in good condition, so he just picked one that gave him the best view. Jumping, climbing, and using his hands, everything was much easier with the armour Quinn had gifted him,

Originally he thought it was something just for speed but he could tell now it was something a lot more than that. After reaching the top of the broken building, he started to look off in the distance at the city.

"I guess, I was worried for no reason."

The moment Stark finished saying those words a big explosion of dust was seen flying in the air, and one of the standing buildings started to tumble down.

"Now, what are the odds that the Dalki chasing after me did that, and is still after me?"

It was a few miles out from where Stark was, so it would be a while until they found him, and with how much noise they were making, it was easy for him to just move to another section of the city if need be.

But, the random destruction around the city was continuing, with whatever was left of buildings was tumbling to the ground, and it almost looked like there were no signs of stopping.

'Is that their tactic, to just go ahead and destroy everything that I might be hiding in or behind. These guys don't really have a brain do they?' Stark thought, but there was a large concern on his mind.

They were adamant on finding him, and if they continued like this, it would also mean they would eventually break the building that Sil was in as well.

'This is more trouble than I originally thought.'

Stark had no choice but to run into the heart of where the destruction was taking place. Just as it didn't take him long to run away, it didn't take him long to reach them either.

Not getting too close and hiding behind one of the large rocks in the street this time, Stark could see all four of the Dalki, crushing building after building with their bare fists. The humans would then search the place after, while the researchers were left in the back.

'Those researchers don't look like they'll be trouble, the difficult variables are the humans, so it might be best to get rid of them first.'

Stark waited for the right moment, and it didn't take long for it to come. The humans were confident that with their strength they could take on one Penswi. So they had split up as they went to search one of the destroyed houses.

Stark just had to pick a target, and then when it had entered one of the rooms, blocked and away form the others, he ran as fast as he could. His hand was pointed and thrusted right through the human's head.

He was dead in an instant, and was unable to even use his powers.

'In a fight to the death where you are after my life, this is one of the only outcomes.'

Stark placed his hand over the human eyes, it was a more peaceful appearance, then dragging the body on the floor he hid it between two buildings and placed quite a bit of rubble over it.

"I didn't see anything inside here."

"Not for me either." The other human replied.

"Don't you think Phil is taking a long time?"

"Yeah maybe we should check it out."

The two of them walked into the building where their friend Phil was. They looked around carefully and that's when they could see blood on the ground.

"Look at th-" One of the men was pointing at the floor, before he met the same fate as his friend Phil, moving from one, Stark went right to the other, and stabbed him in the back of the head, killing both of them quickly.

"There are many Penswi that have died in this war, and I still feel I have yet to do my part and avenge them, but at least this will be a start. "

With the unknown variables out of the way, it was now time for the four Dalki, but he still wasn't confident he could beat all of them. Lifting one of the dead human's bodies on his back, Stark went to walk out.

"Hey!" He shouted.

The Dalki that were eying up their next building to destroy turned around when they could see their target, but he had something strange on his back. Stark threw it on the floor.

"I've already dealt with three of you, and the same thing will happen to all of you." Stark taunted them, and in doing so, all four of the Dalki acted rather than thinking. They ran straight for Stark.

Seeing this, Stark ran ahead avoiding a fight, but he didn't run at his full potential. He wanted the Dalki to see him, just like when running away from H. The Dalki continued to follow, ignoring everything in their way as they crashed through rocks, houses, and rubble.

'This should be far enough.' Stark thought, knowing that the wall of the edge was soon coming up. Now he ran full speed.Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

He soon got out of all of their sight, but instead of running straight or backwards, he ran to the right, all the way round, until he had come back to the point at where he needed to be, he was back at where Sil was.

"It should be a while before they get to here, that should buy me some time." Stark said, as he entered the building and started to walk up. He thought about whether he should continue to try and fight the others, or maybe it would be a better idea to move Sil.

When reaching the top of the stairs though, his footsteps stopped dead still, because he could see a certain someone staring out of the window.

"You're‚Ä¶ finally awake."
