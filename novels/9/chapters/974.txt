Chapter 975 - Same same, but different

After Sil had visited Peter, once again using his soul weapon and putting on a new mud mask, Sil was able to change his appearance. This time, there needed to be quite the change to what Sil would look like, since others would know if he just changed something like one’s hair colour. With Peter not being the best on the spot thinker, he could only produce what he could see in front of him.

A few seconds later, Sil looked like an almost identical copy of Chucky. A plain ordinary looking face with a short haircut. This time nothing that would make one stand out, however, there was one slight difference and that was now Sil’s hair was jet black, while Chucky’s hair was more of a darker brown.

"Why would you do that, we almost look exactly the same?" Chucky asked.

"Almost look the same?" Peter thought, and only realised himself that he had given the two of them a different hair colour. "I must have forgotten a detail while making the mask. Trust me, you don’t stand out, and just because there are two of you, it won’t make a difference. They might even think you’re the same person."

Chucky knew who Peter was, he was meant to be a reliable person, named the Cursed ship protector. This was due to the incident that had happened right when the Crow’s had joined, as Peter dealt with an annoyance quickly, but Chucky was beginning to realise that fighting might be the only thing he was good at.

What was worse, was the class that Chucky and Sil had now transferred to, was Peter’s class. Although Peter wasn’t the main teacher, he was an assistant. Someone who would often just sit in the back and stare at the students.

If anything, Peter was kind of a frightening figure to the students. When Peter had first joined, the teacher had asked him if he could help with several things, or what he was good at, but it seemed like Peter didn’t know anything and everything he touched or tried to assist with would just end up being worse.

There were even a number of expensive items that when Peter couldn’t figure out how to use, he would resort to hitting it, and breaking it altogether.

Therefore the teacher asked him to just control the class and catch the misbehaved kids that weren’t paying attention. Chucky, watched Peter’s method for this, and found him quite frightening. If a few kids in class would start to speak out of turn, he would appear out of nowhere standing right behind them, peeking over their shoulder.

He could keep eye contact, and wouldn’t even blink until eventually the students looked away. There were then several students who had attempted to challenge Peter to a staring competition but no one succeeded and they all turned their heads.

The kids could feel a tingle in their spine and and heavy weight in the air. After that, they never spoke again.

"Is this why they call him zombie Peter?" The students thought.

"Look at his eyes, and even when we don’t think he is paying attention, somehow he’s able to hear us. He’s always watching."

"I’m having nightmares. One time I woke up and I thought I saw him standing in the corner of the room."

"Yeah,I heard him shouting, don’t look at me, stop stop!"

"It might have been him, I think he never sleeps, there’s a bet going around that if anyone can get a photo of him sleeping, there will be a reward of at least 50,000 credits."

For Chucky though, this was just the tip of the iceberg. What was the worst thing, was when the two of them had transferred over, Peter was in charge of making the new name for Sil. After all, now everyone knew Sil and was looking for him, he needed a new alias and he had decided to go with Lis.

’It was as if he didn’t even try, you think people aren’t going to be able to work out that it’s just Sil spelt backwards?’ Chucky thought.

Nonetheless, he was happy that Sil could keep on continuing classes. After being with him a while he was also quite surprised that Sil still wanted to still attend school. He thought based on how shy and afraid of everything, he hated school but it didn’t seem to be the case.

After Chucky had learnt this, the whole thing seemed a bit heartwarming and now Chucky wanted to do what he could to help him out.

Still he had to be careful to not make him angry, especially after witnessing his power.

Over where Shiro, Venus and Swin were, they were currently in another beast class lesson, run by Aden again, and today he seemed to be even angrier than yesterday.

Today’s lesson was about teaching the kids how to activate the beats weapon, in order to draw the power from it. However, a lot of students were finding it difficult. Aden had gotten so angry at one, he had just whacked the weapon out of the students hand and caused it to throb bright red.

"I thought he was angry on the first day we met him, but now he seems like he was calm the other day, what’s wrong with him?" Venus whispered over to Swin.

"I don’t know, but I think he’s pretty annoyed that he has to teach two classes now and cover for Hardy, at least that’s what seems to be the route of the problem.’ Swin replied.

There were more reasons than that. It was true that Aden was annoyed that his workload had increased, but it wasn’t like he wasn’t getting compensated for doing so. At first he thought it would be as simple as just replicating what needed to be done in his own class.

Yet, the first lesson had to be spent reteaching them due to what Hardy had taught, and now they couldn’t seem to progress with the second lesson either.

"What is wrong with you guys. The other classes have already all learnt how to activate the beast weapons and now are moving onto the next stage!" Aden complained.

What Aden didn’t know, was that a lot of the students that were attending General Hardy’s class were actually from class 2A. Knowing that they had weak abilities, or thier MC cells could never be improved upon, they had decided to take the beast class.

On top of this, his demonstration in class, his speeches, had actually inspired a lot of them. So a lot of low level students, who were slow or weak, were attending the beast class. Aden, was thinking that it was due to Hardy’s bad teaching, not realising this was the case.

Still, at least Aden did carry on teaching them as he should, and a light slap on the wrist here and there from anger was as far as he would go.

"I feel bad for Shiro?" Swin whispered while the two of them were pretending to try and activate their weapons. They too didn’t really understand the concept behind it, and were avoiding the teacher afraid of getting a slap themselves, at the same time it seemed like the teacher was avoiding them.

However, there was one person he didn’t even try to look at even once, and that was Shiro. Who had been left on his own since Aden had become a teacher. He was on his own trying to learn how to activate the weapons, and unknown to everyone else, he had already succeeded, but Shiro wouldn’t brag, because he knew it wouldn’t get him anywhere.

’I’m one step closer to proving myself, if Quinn and Sil won’t teach me their ability, then I still need to show through handwork that I can be put to use.’ Shiro thought.

When class ended, Aden rallied up all the students and just shook his head as he looked at them all. Out of the hundred and fifty or so students, only twenty five were able to activate the weapons, which was appalling.

Due to how slow others were at learning, it took some time for him to even go around to reach everyone. Before he knew it, the class was over.

"Look, I’m not trying to be an angry teacher but I just don’t want you guys to embarrass yourselves." Aden said. "After next week, all the beast weapon classes are going to have a joint class, and we’re going to have a little competition. Based on how well you do, you will be awarded points that will go towards your Cursed house.

"Honestly, if you guys go out there now like this, you’re all going to be slaughtered."

Some of the students were nervous after finding out about this news. They already felt bad not knowing how to activate their weapons and learning this just gave them more pressure. Usually in sparring matches, including beast weapons ones, they were allowed to use their ablates aswell. To simulate true warfare.

’Maybe this is my chance to show myself, if all the other generals from the other groups are going to be there.’ Shiro thought.

While Venus and Swim had another thought.

’A week’s time, I hope General Hardy is back by then, otherwise I feel like we’re going to get nowhere with this teacher, maybe he can teach us a few things. Our whole class is going to become a laughing stock.’ Swin thought.

`Hardy, Just what are you doing?" Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
