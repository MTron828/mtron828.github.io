Chapter 1114 - The god of the sea vs a human

The initial reaction in most of those that were there, was to run in and to try and help Mona, not because they thought she was weak, but because that was what they had always done since the beginning.

They had fought against beasts time and time again, that it was now almost a natural instinct to them, however, not all of them had faced a Demi-god tier beast before, and its sheer size had made others think twice.​​

Although not all of them felt the same way, as Chucky, Megan and Hana had decided to pop off into the jungle, and hide behind some of the large leaves next to some Palm trees, they couldn’t help but watch what was about to happen.

"Hey, they’re going to be okay, right?’ Hana asked, since she really hadn’t seen any of the Cursed faction fight for a long time. The last time she had seen Quinn take on an emperor tier beast in the desert, but this beast seemed to be a completely different story.

"Don’t worry, Quinn, and Sil are there, and I think with them two it will be enough, let’s just try not to get hurt.’’ Chucky said, as he carefully touched one of the balck balls he carried with him, just in case they did need to do something.

Then there was Megan, who was shaking. She didn’t want to get involved at all. She had gone away from the fighting scene and had mostly helped out Sam with his duties in the command centre. This was due to a dear friend of hers, Mitchell dying while trying to fight a humanoid legendary tier beast, back when she was still part of the Crows.

While everyone who was a leader in the Cursed had improved, she hadn’t.

"I’m not suited for this stuff. I can’t, I’m not like them. I didn’t change, I’m still human." Megan mumbled as she covered her ears.

"Sorry about that." Quinn said, with his hand held out and stretched towards her. "I’ll leave you in a safe place where you can’t get hurt." Closing his fist, the shadow lock was soon activated and Megan could no longer see the beast.

As Quinn was going to move onto the other two they soon stood up and protested.

"No, wait!" They both shouted.

"We won’t get in the way, but seeing you guys, the best of the best out like this, we don’t want to miss it either." Hana said, speaking for both of them, but Chucky seemingly agreed as he nodded his head up and down.

Quinn placed his hand down as he thought it would be okay. The two of them weren’t weak travellers by any means. It was just with the job they were doing, only the best of the best could face such things.

"Wait a second, Quinn if you’re here, who’s helping out Mona in the fight?" Chucky asked.

As he stopped to the side, they could soon see Mona battling against the Demi-god tier beast and she was doing so alone, without the help of the others. They were all ready to rush in, but Mona had made it clear that she could battle the beast on her own.

"I think she will be okay." Eno said and hearing him say these words, they had slightly agreed to stand by for the first few moments.

One of the large tentacles came down, ready to crash down on Mona chucking up a large amount of water. When it was about to hit her, raising her arm a small type of purple see through shield appeared out of nowhere, like magic. The tentacle had swung hard trying to smash her but it looked like it had almost bounced off.

’That’s not an ability since she has the beast taming ability, so it must be an active skill.’ Quinn thought. ’It looks like a strong one as well, even though her clothes don’t look like the usuals type of beast gear.’

Mona was cotherd in thin cloth, at first he thought it was just a fashion statement along with the hat, but it wasn’t the case at all.

Next though, Mona, leapt up in the air dodging another tentacle swipe, which summoned up a wave of sand in the air, she was then soon hit from above with another, but it seemed like she was expecting it, as the purple shield had appeared above blocking that as well.

However, the force from the hit above was used, and as Mona allowed it to propel herself into the beast’s other tentacle on the ground. Throwing out a fist, she had made impact to the tentacle piercing its skin causing black blood to fall. Soon she started to run up the tentacle.

Now the beast was weary, as it had felt pain, and was unable to attack Mona while running up it’s arm. Instead it flung it’s tentacle high trying to shake it off, but as it did, she lept off and hung onto another one.

"What in the world is she doing? That looks so scary!" Hana said with her mouth left open, It was strange it looked like a small human was going up against a god of the sea, and somehow she was able to avoid the giant tentacles while going from one to another, and hurting it along the way.

"Those world leaders wouldn’t get far with just their powers." Eno started to explain. "Think about it, in their family they probably have many who have similar levels of ability, but what makes them different, allowing them to grow compared to others?

"For Mona, she is fearless when in battle, and will do anything to control a beast stronger than herself. Watch carefully Sil. To use the tame ability, one must touch the beast on top of it’s head. However, if it’s too strong or your MC points are too low, then it will do nothing.

"You are able to weaken the beast, and hope to tame it once more, using your MC cells. Once a link is successful, then those MC cells you have used will be permanently lost in your body, connecting you and the beast at all times.

"However, there are some beasts that will just refuse to connect, but Hilston managed to tame the dragon, so you should be able to as well."

Although Mona hadn’t damaged the beast much, she had tired it out, and it looked like soon, it would dive into the water. Seeing this, Mona then leapt onto the top of its large head, and made sure to dig one of her hands in its skin to hold on.

A few moments later and the waves started to settle, and the beast’s arms were lowering, they were no longer frantically moving about in the ocean. It looked like Mona had successfully captured a beast for herself.

While riding, its large head she slowly made her way to shore, and stopped. Lifting Mona off its head with its tentacle, it then placed her on the sand once again and she had a large grin on her face.

"After my last Demi-god tier beast was defeated, I thought I would never see one again, looks like i’m in luck." She said, "Although, if it needs to be in the sea, it will be quite hard to move it, and use it outside of battle. I wonder if it can survive on land?"

"That was really impressive." Layla said, as she had eyes of admiration. She couldn’t believe how fearless Mona was. "Your beast equipment, it seems to be at a high level to block the beast attacks, it must also be at the Demi-god tier level."

Mona looked at Layla and was about to ignore her, but she had these large puppy dog eyes that nearly made it impossible for her to do so.

"My gear is impressive, but if I hadn’t used my active skill to block one of those attacks I would have been done for. I don’t usually like to do that type of thing, but after seeing it move like so, I thought I could do something and no Demi-god tier beast has never rejected my powers before, so really all I needed to do was get on top of its head."

Saying all these things, just made Mona sound more impressive, and made Quinn wonder how many MC cells she must have to be able to control a Demi-god tier beast.

"Are you able to control a demon tier?" Quinn asked.

Mona took a while before answering the question. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Well if that was the case, then we wouldn’t need this fella here would we. Honestly, I don’t know. I haven’t been lucky enough to ever meet one, but the person before me, who was once on this island, was said to have the same level of ability as mine.

"The one that Hilston took as a chained, and I don’t think she could control the beast you are looking for."

It was hard to imagine how much of a difference a Demon tier beast really was compared to a Demi-god tier. In all honesty, the tier with the most varying powers of strength was the demon tier beast, because human’s hadn’t made a rank higher than that.

Perhaps one demon tier beast could be twice as strong as the other.

What Quinn did realise, was the fact that the ability Mona used, worked similar to his shadow eater skill. The weaker the vampire was the more chance the skill had of working, and this was the same with the beast.

’Let’s just hope Sil can do this without us needing to fight it, then we don’t need to find out how strong it is.’ Quinn thought.

"This dragon is far stronger than that guard of a beast Quinn, I think you should prepare yourself, for a full on battle if need be." Eno said, as if he could read his mind.
