Chapter 1170 The beast“s pledge

Inside the humanoid beast’s mind, both Raten and Shiro were standing opposite the Demi-god tier beast. Its two hands had changed into blades and for some reason Shiro felt like the beast looked even more eager to fight here compared to in the real world.

"Come on, attack it!" Shiro instructed the other, hoping that just like Sil, Raten would be there in a flash.

"What do you want me to do? Slap it to death?!" Raten shouted back, yet the next second the beast dashed forward thrusting with one of its arms. Seeing this Raten booted Shiro out of the way causing him to fall to the floor, whereas he leaned back just in time to avoid the first blow.

His reaction times were quick, and his face was scrunched up as he was frustrated at the situation.

"You damn beast!" Raten cursed as he went to punch its arm, only for a dagger to appear in his hand, slicing at the beast. Seconds before the dagger could reach the beast’s forearm, it transformed its hand into a shield blocking the blow. The beast then used its shield to bash Raten in the face, sending him a few feet into the air.

’What’s wrong? Why isn’t he using his abilities here? ’ Shiro wondered, but then again, the one that was in this mind space right now was Raten instead of Sil. However, he could see something in Raten’s hands. Two daggers that weren’t there before.

’Think this is a mind space, and the daggers appeared when he went for the attack.’ Shiro scratched his head, trying to come up with how the minds worked.

Despite losing out in this first exchange, it didn’t take long for Raten to get up again and charge right in. He himself hadn’t even noticed the sudden appearance of the daggers, too focused on his desire to pay the beast for what it had done to him.

One dagger was thrown at the beast, yet it simply blocked with the still present shield arm. It then swung its bladed arm, but Raten slid underneath the beast’s legs and was now behind it. The next second he buried the dagger deep inside the humanoid beast’s back near its neck. Then he dragged it down half way before the beast moved again. Stepping away Raten now had nothing in his hands.

’Wow, it looks like he’s good in close combat. His fighting style is completely different to Sil’s. Even though they look the same right now, I guess they really are two different people.’ Shiro analyzed. ’But then how did he get those daggers in the first place? I don’t remember seeing them on him.’

"Tell me how the heck do I use my powers here!" Raten shouted at Sil. They had appeared when he wanted them, but now that he was out, he didn’t know how to get more.

"This here isn’t the real world. The two of us are currently inside the beast’s mind. You’ve already done it twice, just use your imagination or something!" Shiro explained, himself not completely sure about the rule. "Think of what weapon or what powers you want to use!"

This was the only thing Shiro could think of, when Raten needed it he thought of the weapons and they appeared in his hands. The only thing was it seemed like it was based on what the person could actually do in real life. Perhaps a limitation set by the person’s original mind itself.

Otherwise, the Demi-god tier beast could probably ilado something similar to its original form, and Raten could properly make anything come to mind. It was at that moment that lighting started to appear from his hands.

"So I can use any power that I can imagine, is that right?" Raten smiled. "I may not be as strong as Sil, but with that sort of power, I should still be able to beat this!" Two more daggers appeared in his hands, slightly larger than the last ones and with a more curved edge.

Sparks started to lighten up, most likely from a lightning ability, and Raten ran towards the beast unafraid. Shiro was just glad that things were working out for him at the moment.

The two were in a tough battle as the Demi-god tier best was faster than Raten, but for some reason he chose to try and fight toe to toe with the beast. During their fight, Shiro noticed something, that the beast seemed to avoid going for vital areas.

It used shallow cuts, or bashes with the shield. Its strikes were more aimed at areas to incapicate Raten, but not in a lethal way.

’Why is it doing this?’ He wondered.

Suddenly, Raten was able to get a clear strike in as he had been closely paying attention to the beast’s movements. He was making use of his experience in fighting and had managed to pierce one of the daggers right through the beasts chest.

He had gotten a hang of this world quicker then Shiro could ever imagine, as he threw blades, making them reaper in his hands, creating other weapons on the fly, even making them return to his hand.

Raten was like a sort of god in this space, most likely stronger then he could have ever been on the outside.

’Are all of Sil’s friends such monsters.?

With the lightning dagger inside its body, Raten let out its powers inside the beast. Several little small white orbs that started to float from the ground. It was something Shiro had never seen before but it was clear it was due to what Raten had just Done.

’What are these things?’ Shiro thought as he reached out his hand. It looked harmless and in some way he could tell that it wouldn’t do any harm to him as he touched it.

The second he touched it, his head felt heavy, as images started to flash through his head.

"We will make you stronger." A voice said, and he could see a man in a white suit. He could see a beast trapped in a container. It wasn’t the Demi-god tier beast, but it had some resemblance to the one currently fighting Raten.

’Are these..memories?’ Shiro theorised.

Now knowing that they wouldn’t hurt him and what they were, Shiro was intrigued. It was too busy with Raten, so Shiro continued to touch the special white lights.

"Finally we have created our first Demi-god tier beast" The same old man was seen, but the beast itself was looking at someone else. A female doctor with round glasses who nodded.

’Who is that girl that the beast is looking at?’

Touching another memory, Sil had found one with her in it.

"I know, I don’t like what they are doing to you, either. Which is why I’m going to help you escape this place." This time he could see that the female in white cloak was the only one in the room talking to the beast.

’These memories I don’t think they are in order.’

The next scene was showing the Demi-god beast down in one of these tunnels, and the beasts all looking up to it. As if it was some type of king. Soon one came up to the stage, and stood directly in front of it. was ready to brace itself. At that moment, the Demi-god tier beat the beast, and pulled out the crystal.

Although no words were spoken here, through the memories Shiro was able to tell what was happening. The beasts sacrificed themselves for the sake of the Demi-god tier beast. They wanted to help it to get rid of the humans.

Looking through more and more memories, slowly Shiro was getting a clear picture of the events that had transpired and now he understood everything that was happening, at least so far.

The beast was originally a humanoid one from this planet, and had been captured by the military. They had run experiments trying to make it stronger. During that time, the beast got close to a scientist who disagreed with their methods, and wished to help it.

When the beast finally evolved, she created a situation that had allowed the Demi-god tier beast to escape. However, the beast seems to have remained, near the Shelter, still stopping the humans by attacking the mines and taking the crystals. In doing so, the other beasts were willing to sacrifice their lives and crystals in order for it to evolve once again.

What Shiro still didn’t understand was why the Demi-god tier beast was so obsessed with stopping the soldiers from mining the crystals, and why it didn’t attack humans.

There was one last memory and in touching this, Shiro finally found his answer.

The white doctor could be seen again, and in some other memories the two of them had conversed quite often, but this time she was shedding tears.

"I’m sorry about what we are doing. I didn’t know it was doing that." She sniffled. "Okay, I’ll help you, but please promise me something. I know we are foolish and we don’t understand everything that is going on, but we are just scared and fighting for our survival, so please forgive us."

After seeing the last message, Shiro somewhat understood, and just maybe there was a way for them to get through this, without the need to fight.

Shiro was sure of it, that they might be needed out there soon.
