The universe that Immortui was in wasn't currently as large as the one where Earth resided, nonetheless it was still a universe, so the space would seem infinite to most and if one tried to attempt to travel and visit every area possible, it would be a next to an impossible task.

Not unless one had special abilities or use of a certain type of travel that the gods tended to use. Nevertheless,the battle between the great demon king and Quinn had sent shockwaves through the universe. The particles of energy in the air were sharing the vibrations of power on and on, making the one and only Immortui aware of what was going on.

Not only that, but the region where the great fight was taking place, Immortui had quite a few close to the area, since that was where the champions resided. Although two of them were willingly working for Immortui, he never felt they were loyal like that of the demon kings.

It was a trait of his if he faced someone he deemed strong to force them to comply with his side. Because Immortui was always looking at the bigger picture, building up his army and strength to go against the Ancient Ones and the celestials. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

There would be next to none on his side when the battle came, so he needed to use everyone he had. At times, Immortui felt like him being sent to this world wasn't a punishment but a gift that allowed him to have a second chance at what he really wanted.

"News has just been received." Immortui said.

Travelling there was a thick red dust cloud not allowing a single person to see what was inside, but the presence of two more individuals on top of Immortui were felt in the thick smoke, the two demon kings he would always have by his side.

"It looks like Kronker was defeated."

The other two demon kings were stunned into silence; they didn't know what to say for a few moments, until one of them eventually shook their head.

"Kornker was a Durum demon, they are ones that get permanently stronger after every battle they participate in, especially ones that push them over the edge." One of the demon kings said. "Kronker wasn't there during the time against the champions, but he felt strong enough to fight against you. You were the last significant battle that Kronker would have had."

Immortui knew what his fellow demon king was saying, that the Kronker who had been defeated, was one that was stronger than the one that Immortui faced.

"I knew he was strong, and one that had great power since he was the key to opening up the portal, but to take a demon king out on his own and that quickly, he is beyond my predictions." The other demon king stated.

Tenbris and Luce were the two demon kings that were always by Immortui's side, and they were the first creations from Immortui's powers, the first demon races that Immortui had created. Due to how long they had been with Immortui, they weren't afraid to speak their mind when they were worried, concerned or excited; it was how they always were with each other.

"I believe I might have made a mistake." Immortui said.

They were rare words that came out of Immortui's mouth which caused Tenbris and Luce to listen carefully.

"Originally, I thought it was best to avoid the area completely. If a fight were to break out, or they saw me having to go toe to toe against a newcomer, I thought there was a good chance of an uprising of some sort. Honestly, it would be a lie if I said I thought Kronker could take on Quinn on his own."

This news had come as quite a surprise to the other two. It seemed that Immortui had great respect for a being that had been raised in another world. It was perhaps the first time they had seen this, or maybe the second time.

"I thought that the fight would go on for long enough that I would be able to order help from either of you two or the other demon kings before Kronker met his demise, but somehow, Quinn was able to defeat Kronker at an incredible speed. I think you should take a look at

"Now, I feel like if we are to leave Quinn be, we will have the same issue. The other champions, as well as the natural inhabitants, will learn of one of the Demon king's falling, and there's a chance that they could all try to turn on us."

The demon kings hadn't realised it until now, they should have noticed it before but it was clear that Immortui was being cautious. When it came to matters with Mundus or the Ancient Ones, they understood his cautiousness, but here, they thought Immortui was simply trying to have fun with Quinn, but it certainly wasn't the case.

"Would you like one of us to go deal with Quinn?" Tenbris asked.

Thinking about it for a while, Immortui eventually came up with an answer and it was one that neither of them expected.

"No." Immortui replied. "You two go to where the champions and the other demon kings are. Make sure there is no chance of something crazy happening. If there is any sign of them trying to rebel, feed them to Unzoku. Although I would like to use their strength in my battle with the Ancient Ones, we can't lose at the first hurdle."

Unzoku, the name of another one of the demon kings. They didn't like the order, but they had to listen to Immortui in the end.

"Wait, if you are sending us two to the champions, then what about Quinn, who is going to deal with him. The king of the Yaks, Armati?" Luce asked.

The Yak race was a giant demon race that had been created by Immortui, one that Quinn had a run in with already.

"I have decided." Immortui said. "That I will deal with him myself. All I need is no distractions from the outside."

How long had it been since the two demon kings had seen Immortui fight in person? Sure he had fought against Mundus, but it was hard to call that a fight since Mundus was only trying to buy time back then. In their minds, it was a shame that they wouldn't see Immortui fight in person since they had been put on guard duty, but with him dealing with the problem, they knew it would be dealt with.

The two demon kings escaped from the thick red mist and like a blur were off in different directions. As for Immortui, the red mist that would usually expand was coming into his body.

"This has been a long time coming‚Ä¶ Quinn." Immortui said.
