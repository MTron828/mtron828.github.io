The demons were a source of fear for the Skullys, especially those like Anon that could barely fight back against them, not unless they were large in number. However, getting anyone to work together in this world was incredibly difficult. 

Even before Immortui had arrived, all of the inhabitants were at each other's throats. Killing was an everyday occurrence amongst each other. There were no laws, and only the strong survived.

The idea of teamwork, or armies, was ridiculous to them. Looking back, Skullys wondered if maybe that's how their whole universe had been taken over so easily, even though they had powerful beings all over. 

It was a surprise that Anon managed to convince Ekeke and Tuni, but others had rejected his offer. Still, it was a change that Anon could see, as everyone had a common enemy. People were starting to come together, but it was a little too late. 

All they could do was live another day and survive, escaping the powerful strong demons. Those that had the power to fight back had been restrained and could no longer help. 

So why… why now, when looking at this individual, did Anon start to have a bit of hope. The being named Quinn had easily dealt with three demons and hadn't even received a scratch on him. 

On top of that, he didn't hesitate to kill the demons. 

'I was right… Unlike us, he has no fear of them. He was serious about his words before, about killing Immortui.' 

Using his senses, Quinn was trying to see if there were any other demons in the area, but he was unable to sense any, so for now he suppressed his aura inside of him. Another thing Quinn had done, was disable one of the passive effects on his armour. 

Although they were passive effects, it didn't mean that he couldn't disable them, but more so that there was no cool down or timer when using them. He could still take away the powers. 

One of the passive skills on the armour was the burning effect it would have on those nearby. It was great when fighting a large amount of enemies, but it wasn't so much when he was trying to sneak around, since them feeling pain would make them aware. 

'I did want to try it out though, to see how effective it would be against the demons as well. It makes me wonder, like vampires, are all demons weak to the power of the sun?' Quinn thought.

"Thank you for saving us." Anon said, coming over. The other two were still too stunned to say anything, they were prepared to lose their lives.

"You didn't treat me with hostility, and I know nothing about this place. Besides you told me to give you support from the back." Quinn smiled.

"Is it true?" Anon asked. "About what you said before, that you plan on taking on Immortui?"

"It is true." Quinn answered. "I wasn't completely honest with you before because I wasn't sure of the situation, but let's just say that I'm not from here, and the sole reason why I am here is to take him down."

Anon suddenly started to get down on his knees. He looked like he was in a begging position but it wasn't quite the same. It was quite natural in nature when one asked someone they believed was higher up compared to them, to try and lower themselves to the one in front. 

"Then, please, rescue the old champions, if you do that, with them by your side I believe you will have the best chance of taking out Immortui!" Anon asked.

Quinn did think about it for a moment, but he had quickly made a decision. 

"I'm sorry, but I can't do that." Quinn said. "I don't have time to try and save people. The longer I take, and the more I delay in taking out Immortui, the more damage he can do to those I care about." 

Saving individual lives wouldn't mean much, even if he defeated Immortui. If he took too long, then maybe everyone he cared about would be gone. 

"If you have any information that will help me get to him, then please speak, if not, then this is where we part ways." Quinn explained. Although his first interrogation of a demon didn't work, he felt like eventually one would say or know something.

"I know you're strong, I can see that, and the fact that you have no fear must mean that you somewhat know how strong Immortui is as well, but even if you do have the strength to defeat Immortui on his own, he is not the only one you have to worry about. There are the demons as well, and that's where the champions can help you!" Anon explained. 

"The demons? If you are talking about the demon general's then I won't have any trouble with them." Quinn had run into a couple of demon generals now and both times he had defeated them with ease. 

At their level, they weren't enough to get in his way of his fight. The biggest benefit was just thier blood.

"Anon shook his head, it's not the demon generals that you need to worry about, it's the demon kings. Each of them are incredibly powerful with power close to that of Immortui. 

"Even if you had the same power as Immortui, taking on the demon kings would be impossible as well. Not unless you had some help."

When hearing about the demon kings a couple of things came to Quinn's mind. If he himself could rise to such power and was a creation of Immortui, then why couldn't other creations of Immortui rise to power as well. 

So it wasn't unbelievable to think that there would be those that were as strong as Immortui by his side. The second thing though, was the quest. 

The quest had told him to consume the blood of five of the strongest races at the demon general level. Did this mean if he was to consume the demon king level blood that his blood could evolve another time? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"There are a total of five demon kings." Anon continued to explain. "Two of them stay by Immortui's side at all times. While the other three are spread out to control and contain the rest of the universe in charge of overseeing several planets. 

"I know you're strong, and it might be hard to believe the strength of one of the demon kings. So, all I ask is that you take out the demon king that is on this planet, if you did that, you will then understand how hard it will be to fight Immortui on your own.

Quinn stood in silence for a bit, until he eventually spoke. 

"If I kill the demon king, will he know where Immortui is?" 

"Of course!" Anon answered. "But you might want to ask him before you kill him."
