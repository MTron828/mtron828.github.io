*****

Both Quinn and Ray continued to clash fist with fist. They weren't using anything else to fight as both of them seemed to be putting their all into just throwing out a punch with all their strength, all of their power, with the aim to take out the other.

The whole planet started to vibrate with each hit, and the two of them had long stopped fighting on the ground. Ray was trying to strengthen his punches by using his wings as a boost.

From time to time, he would fly backwards and then dive in, but Quinn would equally run in the air picking up speed, and throw out his fist. He didn't bother to try and use tricks with the cloud clones or anything else, because he was aiming for something else.

The gold glow on the gauntlets continued, and the energy surrounding the gauntlets themselves was growing ever so slightly.

'I have to keep at it, I can't slow down or let up. A punch‚Ä¶ a punch will get through!' Quinn thought, throwing out his fists again and again.

Some might think the two were just desperately fighting, with no plan at all, but that wasn't the case for Quinn.

[Asura's rage]

[With each hit successfully landed on the same opponent, the energy will continue to grow. If a different target is hit, or the same target is not hit within 10 seconds, then the gauntlets energy will reset]

Right now, Quinn was betting on the active skill of the gauntlet. Its effect was the same as one of the vampire leaders, but with the boost in strength and speed the gauntlets gave one already, it was amazing that an item could have such an effect.

But because of the active skill, Quinn wasn't using anything else, and just continued to punch, increasing the strength of his weapons bit by bit. The good thing was Ray didn't seem to notice as he had allowed the two to fight like this.

"This is exactly what I like, a good old fashioned brawl!!! Let's see which one of us tires out, or slips up first!" Ray shouted.

The two of them continued like this for a while. Time continued to pass with the punches not letting up. A few minutes had turned into several and it was when Quinn started to notice that something had to be up, something wasn't right.

'How? How is this happening. I can feel the energy in the God Slayer gauntlets rising. It's even rising now as our fists hit, so how‚Ä¶ How is he able to match the power? Is his power increasing as well, with every hit? Is he matching me punch for punch still even now?'

It was hard for Quinn to believe, but it had to be the only option. Regardless, he continued, if Ray was able to match his power, then he would have to tire out eventually, right?

As a few minutes passed again, he quickly realised he was wrong about this as well.

"Did you think you could tire me out? If you thought that, then I have to tell you, you are very, very, wrong." Ray stated.

Ray had fought even in the state he was in for several days without tiring out. This was even with him putting a 100 percent into every hit, and it was all because of the other celestial power that was inside him.

When Ray had helped out fighting against the Chained, Ray had come across an old celestial, one that allowed someone unlimited amounts of energy. Which was why he could go on all day every day.

What Ray didn't know was that it was the same for Quinn. Due to the Limitless set effect on his armour Quinn wasn't tiring either, not one bit. The only thing the two were doing was chipping away at the planet beneath them with the strength of their strikes.

"If this is all you have to show, then I have to say you have already begun to bore me."

Turning his head to the side, Ray opened up his mouth and fired out several fireballs. Quinn had counted ten of them.

In this moment Quinn continued with his hits, thinking that if he was distracted with doing something else, it was his chance to get a hit in, but Ray continued to open his mouth, firing out fireballs in all of the areas in the air and all around them, not having a single one of them aiming for Quinn.

That was until he opened his mouth aiming for one right at Quinn. Spinning his body Quinn managed to avoid the fireball but there was another one that went straight at him hitting him on his back and exploding. DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

At the same time, Ray came out from the side, throwing a punch hitting Quinn right on the side of his face. His body moved away and crashed right into another fireball.

At that moment, all of the fire balls were right next to Quinn and started to hit his body one after another again and again.

Ray had been setting up the fireballs leaving the energy floating in the air all around. They were like small bombs that he could set off whenever he needed them, and now all of them were exploding at once right on Quinn.

Bracing himself, Quinn placed his arms up and took the hits, he could feel it damaging his skin and bones and his body was trying to heal from the wounds.

'I can't go in my shadow right now, it will waste too much time, I have to get another hit in, before it's too late!'

Eventually, covering everything in a shadow around him, Quinn burst through, spinning his body and letting his shadow do the work to block most of the fireball explosions. Opening up a shadow portal in front of him Quinn went right through it and appeared by Ray's side.

It was the same trick he had done with the clones, but this time it was him. The fist was thrown by Quinn, but Ray had flown up in the air avoiding the hit.

"Do you think the same trick would keep working on me?" Ray asked.

[Asura's rage has been reset]

Quinn hadn't managed to hit Ray in time, and the golden glow around his gauntlets had subsided. From his position, Ray dived in.

He had no idea about the gauntlets and just threw out his fists like normal. Seeing this, due to what he had been doing this whole time, Quinn had decided to do the same. When the fists collided, there was a clear winner in terms of power.

Quinn's fist was chucked back, along with his body. Ray had even stopped punching for a second due to how surprised he was.

'That‚Ä¶ that confirms it, he must have been getting stronger with every hit as well, but it's not an effect, he was just getting better, and now his hits are a lot stronger than mine.' Quinn thought.

'I have to do something, and fast, otherwise, I'll lose this fight.'

"You were right." Quinn said. "I was trying to wear you out. I thought that I had the advantage in that area at least but it's clear now that I don't. So I just have to use all that I have."

The shadow had risen from Quinn's body and soon spread out producing a mist in the air, covering the whole area the two of them were fighting in.

[Soul weapon activated.]

After that, the dark shadow covered his gauntlets but Ray had noticed there was something different in the shadow's colour, it was slightly red this time.

Ignoring what was happening, Ray went forward again and threw out his fist and Quinn had done the same. It was the same pattern as before as fist collided against fist.

Ray's power overpowered Quinn causing his arms to jerk back slightly, and when the other hand hit, it had done the same, but when Ray went to throw out another punch he felt a delayed strike hitting his hands pushing them back slightly.

"This won't even tickle!"

Both of Quinn's palms struck out, hitting Ray right in the stomach, behind his hands were the flowing image of fire red blood dragons made of blood aura going right through Ray's body.

[Twin dragon blood palm strike]

For the first time in the fight, blood spit out of Ray's mouth, and the strike wasn't over yet, because thanks to the blood shadow, Ray now had to deal with it for a second time.
