Chapter 2525 ¬†A New Flame

'The Last Chance.' These words had perked everyone's ears up, and even Peter had turned around to look at Mundus. Just what was he playing at? Why would he say such a thing to a room full of desperate people?

These words carried a lot of weight because it meant that the Messenger must have some way to save Quinn.

"What are you saying, you can bring back the dead?" Hikel asked. "Are you going to use some type of power like Immortui has, or is it something different altogether?"

Mundus didn't answer and instead walked back over to where the others were. He then looked at Quinn, whose body was on the ground, and he stared intensely at every part of him.

Peter blocked his way; he didn't trust Mundus and didn't want him to get any closer.

"Do you know how me and Quinn got to know each other so well?" Mundus asked, not expecting an answer. "It's because Quinn works for us, he works as an agent for the Celestials, for the gods."

There was an uneasy look on Calva's and Pultra's faces. They had heard the mention of Celestials many times. It was the enemy that Immortui was going after, but the details of what an agent was weren't entirely clear either.

"One of his jobs and part of a deal we had made was for him to travel around the universe and defeat God-slayers, powerful beings with immense power. Those that were too strong for the gods to handle. Honestly, he surprised me. VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

"Each powerful enemy he came across, he had managed to defeat them. I think it was at that time that I felt the same as all of you. I too felt like Quinn perhaps could be the person that could defeat anyone he faced, and that included Immortui. I think that's where my faith in him started."

The way Mundus talked about Quinn, he had done so in a manner that didn't make it sound like they were enemies, and it also felt like he knew some things that they didn't. It was causing the group's heart to feel heavier than before. How much was he carrying with him?

"Despite my belief, he lost, though, and I thought it was quite clear that I was wrong," Mundus said, as he walked closer to Peter to the point where his face nearly touched his.

"But it turns out all of you feel the same way as I did, so maybe I'm not wrong. If you want him to come back, then I suggest you move," Mundus ordered.

Now they were sure of it; Mundus had to have a way to make him come back. At that moment, Sil was the one that stood up from the ground and grabbed Peter's hand, pulling him away.

"I think he means it when he says he can help Quinn; he helped me as well. Right now, we have to be honest with ourselves; we can't do anything," Sil said.

Unwillingly, with clenched fists, Peter allowed his body to be dragged to the side. His legs were moving, but the killer stare he gave Mundus remained on him.

Now, with Quinn's body in sight, Mundus lifted both of his hands, and energy left them, directly hitting Quinn. An orb of white energy surrounded his body. It looked untouched, even with the energy surrounding it, and nothing appeared different.

"Back then, when Quinn was facing the powerful god-slayers, there was one that caused us more problems compared to any other. One that no matter how many times we killed it, it would keep coming back again and again, it was a true Phoenix."

"A Phoenix?" Edvard said.

Most knew of the legendary creature apart from the natural inhabitants.

"What is a phoenix?" Calva asked.

"It's a legendary creature," Hikel replied. "It's been talked about in legends for thousands of years through all our civilizations, the vampires, the humans, maybe even before then. A bird that is made of flames, that when it perishes it is reborn."

"Correct," Mundus said as he continued to use his powers.

With a careful eye, they were watching what was happening. Quinn's condition was getting no better; the wound was still in his chest, but the armour that was on his body that was broken, it was slowly coming back. It was restoring itself. Even the pieces that were melted or merged into his body.

It had soon even covered the entire of Quinn's chest, going over the hole.

"One of the legendary beasts in existence with extreme power that goes beyond even the Celestials' understanding, along with a red dragon," Mundus mentioned. "This Quinn in front of you had defeated it, and in doing so, he had obtained a god-slayer crystal.

"Usually, I would keep such crystals for myself, as the power they hold could disrupt the great balance the universe has, but due to a tricky situation with a Dark Mage, I had made a deal. This armour has the power of the Phoenix inside it, and I can feel that the power inside is still very much alive."

Mundus didn't go on to explain, but he could feel another power as well, something else that was lingering inside Quinn's body as if attached to it. When things died, the energy would move to different spaces.

Immortui had a close link to this space with his powers and was able to even pull people out of it. He could, in a way, increase the power of this energy and place it back in the body, saving those that were on the verge of death.

It wasn't just Mundus, but at the time Immortui could tell as well. He wondered if it was due to him still having a link to the Golden space, or if it was something else altogether, but it didn't matter to Immortui because he just wanted the crystal.

The final pieces of the armour were coming together. Mundus was using his ability to speed up time in a certain area, to speed up the repair process, one of the active skills the armour had.

'I've been watching you, Quinn. I know the effects of your armour, I know the power it holds, which is why others will fear you, but from watching you, I know what type of person you are. You aren't one to start trouble to gain more; you are just a person who wishes to protect what you have.'

Eventually, all of the pieces had come together, they had joined up and melded into place, the engraving on the chest started to light up red, looking as if flames were coming off from it.

"As an agent of the gods, I will give you one more assignment, go and take out Immortui," Mundus ordered.

The entire of Quinn's body lit up at that moment, and at the same time, the system had activated.
