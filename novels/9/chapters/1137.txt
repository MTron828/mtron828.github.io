Chapter 1138 - Use my body

[Error]

[Blood ritual is unable to activate]

[It is not effective in this situation.]

Despite Oscar being in front of him, this was the first time that Quinn had gotten this type of message. He had been worried that turning him might not be enough to save him, but he hadn’t been mentally prepared that it was actually impossible.

He tried a second time just for good measure, perhaps he had done something wrong. Unfortunately, it only resulted in the same error message appearing once more.

’Again!’ Quinn repeated in his head, as he attempted to activate it through the system, yet nothing changed.

’Quinn, I don’t think it will work no matter how many times you try. It is clear that there is some type of underlying problem, just like when Shrio tried, in this type of situation there is nothing we can do.’ Vincent said.

Hearing these words from a man Quinn knew to be many times wiser than him, who also knew far more about the Vampire World, his hands started to feel weak as he started to sink down in the liquid. There were those that could possibly help, like Tempus or the second leader’s ability but there were reasons problems with getting the vampire world involved.

From the outside, Samantha could see this and judging by the lack of any change in her father’s condition as well as the defeated look in Quinn’s eyes, she understood that all hope was lost.

Immediately, she fell to her knees, there was no more energy in her body and they slammed into the hard ground. This time not even Fex was ready to catch her, but as her body was becoming limp, he did manage to catch her with his strings before her head hit the ground.

"We need to get her some food and energy. I don’t think staying in this place is helping her at all. Force feed her if need be, just make sure she gets it!" Fex shouted, as he ordered the other soldiers as if they were his own people.

Due to his assertive tone the soldiers didn’t even question Fex’ order. A doctor who had been on standby came to look over Samantha. Her diagnosis was that Samantha lacked enough sleep, hadn’t eaten or drank anything and was mentally exhausted.

Since there was nothing they could do for Oscar, the group had followed into a larger part of the medical bay, where there were several beds laid out, but at the moment there weren’t any other patients currently being treated. It wasn’t like the private rooms that had been used for Sach and Owen.

Here, a lot of them sat on the seats that were spread around the room, thinking about what they had just seen. Others were trying to comfort each other at the same time as well. While Quinn, and few continued to stay by Samnatha’s side, who had a drip that had been placed inside of her body.

"You really couldn’t turn him?" Fex asked, breaking the silence.

"I don’t really know what happened. I don’t know if it’s my fault, or maybe something else. I was sure since he wasn’t completely dead, that there should be at least a chance to turn him. Perhaps he would have turned into some type of undead class, but as long as he would have improved we would have been able to deal with it then." Quinn replied, yet all those worries and thoughts before seemed to have been for naught.

"Nice reflexes." Sach said with a smile, but it soon went away when he looked at Samantha. "I heard what happened when you went to visit Oscar. I assume you all being here means you couldn’t do to him what you did to me?"

"Quinn, I’m sure you tried your best. Nobody will blame you for it not working this time. All of this isn’t your fault in the first place. It’s mine. If only I was stronger, he wouldn’t have had to try and hold off the Dalki on his own. Oscar wouldn’t have to have gone through all of that."

Shaking his head, Sach went to take a seat along with the others.

"Sach, Nathan told us that you were there when this all happened. Maybe you know what was going on. How did the three of you even survive such an attack?" Quinn asked. "If even Oscar ended up in that state, surely he could have killed you all, and why didn’t you tell us before."

Right now, certain pairs of eyes were gone. Bonny and Void, the reporter duo, were currently going around looking at the ship and conducting more interviews. Nathan and his group were back to doing their duty, as they had a ship to run, and temporarily he was taking the commanding role.

"I didn’t want to say much before because honestly I don’t really understand it myself." Sach replied after he made sure nobody was listening in. "You see, me and Samantha were both fighting One Horn. It was clear from the beginning that we were no match for him, but at the same time we were unable to turn our backs."

"At this point the humans who we assumed were V and the Dalki were both fighting against us. If we ran away, then it meant everyone else would have died as well, and I’m not sure One Horn would have let us in the first place. That’s when Oscar showed up to reinforce us."

"He told us to run away, but we didn’t listen. After seeing Oscar fight with the Demon tier weapon against the Dalki, it quickly became clear that they were stronger. I ended up in the state that I was in, and Oscar was getting pulled apart by One Horn, while Samantha could do nothing but watch."

"He had a giant grin on his ugly face, like a young boy enjoying the fact that he was ripping the wings off a fly. He could have killed him straight away, but he didn’t. Samantha eventually got the courage to charge forward, hoping to somehow stop the Dalki from killing her father, but I knew it was useless."

"Honestly, I had accepted that we would all die down there, but then someone had picked up the Demon tier weapon. It was a girl who looked to be from the shelter. She had long black braids, and she held up the sword pointing it towards the Dalki."

"She told One Horn that he should let us go. It didn’t make any sense, but for some reason he complied. He had just defeated Oscar wielding the Demon tier weapon, but for some reason he didn’t seem to be willing to defy that girl."

"It was then that I noticed that none of the humans that had been attacking us had any of the traits that were described as the V. I didn’t understand anything, which was why I didn’t want to say anything to anyone yet. The fact that humans were working with the Dalki, and that they were listening to them no less."

"After that interaction, all of the Dalki stopped attacking, allowing us to retreat, and barely come out of it alive. Eighty percent of our forces had already been dealt with."

Hearing all of this, Quinn couldn’t quite put his finger on what was going on either, but if those groups of people were really the ones that Arthur had stayed with, then maybe there was a reason why they had listened to the Dalki. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

’Are the humans living there actually working with the Dalki? But then why did they save Oscar and the others? Why would someone as powerful as One Horn listen to a girl... unless she was perhaps the only vampire there?’ Scratching his head, there was just too much to think about.

After the conversation had died down a bit, they started to ask Sach more details about the fight that went on. Their number of forces, the Dalki’s strength and more, but Shiro and Sil were busy having their own conversation from before.

"It doesn’t make any sense." Shiro said as he looked at his hand. "I went into the black space, just like I did with you, so doesn’t that mean I entered his mind? So why couldn’t I find his consciousness? Did I not go deep enough?"

"The others said you were drained Shiro, your ability probably won’t let you spend more time in there or go deeper." Sil said. "Your ability seems strong but maybe it needs to be even stronger."

Hearing this, Shiro was kicking himself for being overconfident. He still couldn’t believe that he had given them all hope, and he felt like he was to blame. But through their conversation and seeing how Shiro was, it had given Sil an idea.

"Remember what I just said, about how maybe your ability wasn’t strong enough, what if I said there was a way to make your ability stronger, by using my body." Sil offered, placing his hand on his own body.
