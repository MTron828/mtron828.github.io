Out of all of the people to appear and save them in their current situation, they had never expected Russ to appear. Quite honestly, both Chris and Hikel had even forgotten somewhat that Russ was even with them, since they hadn't seen him in battle and were too concerned with their own fights. 

The thing was, in this world, where Russ had no one to help him and no way out, he needed to help the only few that were on his side, he just wouldn't risk his life doing so, but having watched everything, he calculated it was better to have them alive than dead. 

With the attack from Tenbris going in two directions, he needed to act fast, at the same time he didn't exactly know how strong the attack was, so the safest bet was to use the newly acquired sword he had with him. 

Swinging it through the attack, it had done what it always did, and that was negate the attack, stopping it completely. After using the sword, he quickly placed it back in the scabbard.

A few words were said, but in truth, Russ was keeping up certain appearances. Hikel standing from behind had noticed something, that his back leg was shaking.

'What's wrong, the attack didn't hit him, did it? So what's happened?' Hikel thought. 

On the other hand, the fact that a person was able to block Tenbris' attack like it was nothing, he was cautious about his next move and looked at the person, wondering if he recognised them or not. 

"Ah, now I see!" Tenbris said, his expression changing to one of confusion back to his calm self. "That sword, I should have recognised it a lot sooner, but to be honest, I am surprised that you are able to wield it freely. Either way, that sword's a double edged sword in the first place."

'Does he know?'  Russ thought.

At the moment, Russ felt like it was quite possible that he would pass out. Either that or he would throw up all over the place. His head was banging with pain after using the sword, and he had only done so once. 

'I warned you didn't I?' The sword said. 'There was a reason why I was always in that girl's possession.'

There had been times where others had used the sword before, but most of that was in the past before it became Layla's personal possession. Back then, much of its power was dormant. 

When the power of the sword was dormant, only the part where the blade would be hit, would block abilities. As Layla started to draw out more power from the sword it was becoming more active and was able to do more things. 

Creating an area where abilities don't work, blocking out attacks within a certain radius, and negating attacks as long as they were connected to the source completely. 

However, all of this came with a cost and it was at one's mental capacity. When using the sword's powers, the users would feel emotions throughout their body. Memories that weren't theirs would appear, and they would feel great pain over those that died. 

Quinn had broken the seal from the sword, putting his own mark on it when he was a celestial, and although it subdued a lot of these feelings allowing Layla to use it as a normal sword. If anyone else tried to draw out its power, they would suffer the same effects as before. 

Layla was a Hannya, a creature that fed off negative emotions for its powers in the first place. So she was used to it, and in turn using the sword in a way powered her. For Russ, it wasn't the same. 

Yet, he was handling it better than most that would try to use the sword. Perhaps it was because of his own pain, and his own dark memories that he harboured, he could withstand it a little but not completely. 

'If he knows about the sword, then I won't be able to use it as freely.' Russ thought. 'But I'm sure these guys have no idea what I can do with my powers, and they will have no idea about what this God Slayer bracelet can do either.' 

Tenbris continued to look at the three intruders. Two of them were extremely worried about the current situation. They were fearful even before he had arrived, he could see that. 

So then why, why was the person who suddenly appeared with the black sword, still brimming with confidence, or was he just too insane to care? This was natural for Tenbris' nature; he was too cautious. 

It was at a standstill, but one side felt a lot more confident then the other, that was until something happened. Hikel suddenly looked up, he could feel something coming from the top of the pit. 

"That… that was the signal." Hikel said. 

The message had been delivered, it meant that the others had found Quinn, but at what a time. They were meant to be there to support Quinn, but if they left here, with these guys on their back, then wouldn't they just be bringing him more trouble?Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They would be bringing enemies that they themselves were unable to beat.

'Huddle up!'

A voice was heard in all three of their heads, and it was one they had heard before. Not hesitating for a moment, all three of them bunched up together. Suddenly, another person appeared. 

"It looks like the three of you got yourself in quite a pickle." Sil said. "I would love to leave them with something but we need to go." 

Tenbris, who saw the man just appear, had a bad feeling about what was about to happen. 

"Stop them!" He shouted as his whole body was covered in a dark blue force. It spread to the entire ground, forcing all of the werewolves' heads to slam to the floor. They were unable to move, and the ones that he was trying to stop had already disappeared. 

Sil had teleported them out of the pit.

——

Escaping with the others, Sil continued to teleport until they were a distance far away, and were on a different planet altogether compared to the one they were at before. Now they were in the middle of a desert of some kind. 

"Oh… we're alive… we're alive." Hikel said, falling to his knees. 

It was the first time the others had even seen him act this way. His composure had completely broken down. It was the most intense situation he had ever been in his life, so he felt like it was okay to act like this for a little bit. 

"I'm sorry, but you all need to get ready. I'll heal you up, and then we need to go, get ready." Sil said.

They were wondering, was it possible that Sil and the others were in an even worse situation?
