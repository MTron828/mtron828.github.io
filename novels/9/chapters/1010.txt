Chapter 1011 - Can I stab you?

It didn’t take long for the mysterious Vampire to figure out what had been summoned seemingly out of nowhere from Fex. However, it did seem to surprise the Vampire as well.

"I’m interested in finding out if this was something you found out yourself or a technique shared amongst the new generation." The Vampire said.

This gave a brief break for the moment. Right now, the two of them weren’t being confrontational. In all honesty, Fex’s mind was racing at the moment.

For one, his wounds were healing slower than his opponents. He had gotten a few hits in while fighting in the bar, but there didn’t seem to be a scratch on the man.

The second reason was what he was now holding in his hand.

’What the hell am I meant to do now!’ Fex thought. ’I summoned my blood weapon in a panic, but there’s no one to use it on.’

Fex’s blood weapon, which was black in colour but clear like glass, needed blood to activate it. This was true for all blood weapons, but Fex’s needed blood as an even bigger requirement. The needle itself had to be filled with blood, and then either injected into humans to empower them with strength, or the needle could be injected into himself.

’I can’t exactly just stab my needle into one of these random onlookers. They would never let me do such a thing, and it’s wrong if I just force them.’

"Is something wrong, or do you need me to attack you first?" The Vampire said, charging forward and now was directly in Fex’s face. Lifting up his fingers, red blood strings rose, tangling the Vampire’s legs up.

"I wasn’t just doing nothing but standing still!" Fex shouted. Using his blood control, any red string left on the ground could be moved slightly without requiring it to be attached to his fingers. Then grabbing the needle, Fex stabbed it right into the Vampire’s shoulder, digging in a few inches before it had stopped entirely.

"It’s weak, but perhaps because you have no blood, there are plenty of people around you. Why don’t you use one of them?" The Vampire said, taking a step forward with a smile.

Looking into the Vampire’s eyes, Fex could feel something odd, and at the same time, no regular vampire should ever be this strong. He was one of the strongest nobles. Why was he afraid?

"And what the hell is with this taunting!" Fex said as he pulled his needle out with his string attached to the little loop at the end and started to swing it wildly like a windmill in the air.

Once again, Fex swung out the needle straight, and it came out fast and heavy. This time the force seemed far more substantial than before. Still, the strings seemingly around the Vampire started to disappear, and the Vampire had avoided the attack.

"Yes! That’s it! You have a difficult opponent in front of you. Use your mind to evolve more. One can’t magically get stronger in the middle of a fight, but they can use their mind to their advantage!" The Vampire shouted. "You need to show me everything you have. "

"Teacher Fex, what is going on here? Who is this man you are fighting?" Samantha asked.

While head general Innu went out with the students, he would be in charge of the teachers and the students, and Samantha was left behind to stay in the Shelter. Coordinating if anything was to happen. She had been alerted that there was a commotion going on but didn’t expect to see another teacher in the middle of a fight.

"This is.." Fex was struggling to come up with an answer. He had actually started the confrontation, but he couldn’t exactly just say he was a vampire, but what reason could he give.

While Fex was unfocused, a fist came out from the Vampire, but a wall suddenly rose in the middle of the two of them. Samantha immediately decided to act once she saw her teacher was about to be hurt.

However, the fist had gone through the wall, breaking it to pieces, but it allowed Fex enough time to avoid the punch coming his way. Instead, he wrapped the arm with string, and then using all of his strength he lifted the Vampire in the air, and slammed him into one of the buildings on the opposite end of the street they were fighting in.

"He’s from Pure!" Fex finally figured out a good excuse, and saying those words finally got most of the people to clear the area. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Samantha rushed over to Fex’s side and looked at him for a few seconds, up and down. She even patted him in certain areas, which made Fex blush a bit while smelling the scent coming from her hair.

"Good, it doesn’t seem like you’re hurt," Samantha said.

The sound of rubble could be heard moving, and the Vampire stood up with his head bleeding, but the rest of his body looked to have hardly been injured. Fex didn’t think it would be over for a second, but just wanted a small break from the constant fighting.

"Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?" Fex said as he pulled over his black needle with a piece of string towards his hand. "Can I stab you with this?"

"What are you crazy!" Samantha shouted. "A person is attacking us right now, and you want to stab me?"

"Wait, let me explain! Think about it. There’s a reason I asked. I didn’t just want to stab you!" Fex argued, but the Vampire was increasingly getting closer. That’s when Fex noticed, the Vampire wasn’t charging forward.

In fact, the Vampire hardly charged forward during the fight, as if he was always waiting for Fex to show him something.

Then for a brief second, the Vampire looked up towards the corner of the sky and looked back down at the two.

"I still don’t know if you are ready for what’s about to come, but it seems somehow you truly are united with the humans, but that will soon be put to the test." The Vampire said.

"What do you mean!" Fex asked, no longer wanting to engage. If the other Vampire wasn’t attacking, it would give him at least time to recover.

"Sometimes, people are unable to see what’s right in front of them." The Vampire said, looking at Samantha this time, and feeling a little uncomfortable, she shifted towards Fex, but then seeing the black needle in his hand, she moved back away.

"Around two years ago, the Dalki came to this planet. It was an event that was recorded and spread to the whole world. It would be impossible for you to not know of it."

Of course, Samantha knew exactly what event the man was talking about. At the time, the student known as Quinn and a few others had run into a Dalki here.

"Do you think that was a coincidence, that a stray scout would just land here for no reason? Did no one stop to think if there was an alternative task, a mission that it was sent here to do?" The Vampire continued.

Of course, the military had done some research into it, but it really looked like a stray scout from the Dalki had attacked, and they were unable to find anything else.

"The Dalki are smarter than you humans take credit for, especially with him pulling strings. They will soon be upon us. It will be interesting to see if you still keep your resolve to not hurt humans when it comes to their life of yours." The Vampire said. "I have run out of time." and as quickly as he appeared, he promptly disappeared as well.

The two of them were left there to take in the mysterious person’s words. The one thing that stuck out to them was that the Dalki was coming, and it was quite clear he was claiming that they would be coming to this planet.

The question was, when?
