Chapter 838: Useless Title

Having come back from his meeting with Dwight, Quinn headed to the inner castle area. At the moment it was deserted with no signs of life after all the people that had died in the attack. Usually people from the pooling area would fill in those numbers, yet none had taken that chance so far.

Quinn wanted to improve the inner castle area. With Dwight having warned him about the possibility of another attack, and after Bryce’s comment he was sure that the intention of the first family leader was to get rid of him altogether.

As such, he was inspecting the security around the place, focusing on the large wall built around the inner area, the small gate at the front, and the side gates in the walls allowing one to travel from castle to castle.

He couldn’t stay in the tenth’s castle area forever and he also wasn’t expecting the vampires to leave their home and come aboard the Cursed ship, so that left him with only one choice. He somehow needed to improve the castle’s defences.

Luckily, he had acquired just the right tools for that recently. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

’This reputation store sure is handy for this. Now if only I could figure out how to get some more reputation points?’ Quinn thought to himself.

Upon returning to the castle, he checked if anything had happened during his absence, yet there didn’t seem to be anything noteworthy.

He only briefly encountered the students all together. Since he had become the family leader, they had all bowed down to him. Not knowing what to do, Quinn awkwardly just waved at them before leaving quickly.

’Seems Fex still hasn’t returned. Well good for him, there must be a lot he has to talk about with his family.’

Sitting down he continued to try to come up with an idea how to get more reputation.

’I can see you are struggling.’ Vincent noted. ’Do you want me to give you a hand?’

Struggling to find a name, he had planned to ask Vincent for help anyway, yet the way Vincent had approached him first and the proud tone in his voice somehow pissed Quinn off. As if the other was indicating he was better than him.

Choosing to ignore Vincent for now, Quinn continued brainstorming. Eventually, after not being able to come up with something he sighed in defeat.

’Please help me out.’ Quinn requested in frustration.

’I believe the system was being quite literal when it called them reputation points. Even the shop itself only opened up when you became the tenth leader.’ Vincent started to explain.

’Which leaves me to conclude, that more reputation points will be awarded as long as you increase your reputation with those in the tenth family. They must think better of you, or do something to better their lives. Like remember when Edward first assigned you a task? It was to deliver blood to all those in the inner area, right?’

Vincent’s logic made sense, but now Quinn was left to wonder how to better their lives or give off a good impression. After all, he frankly didn’t know them too well yet.

After Quinn formulated a small theory, he decided to call over Timmy, Sam and Logan. If it really was about increasing one’s reputation, then those three would be the best candidates to help him verify it.

After the trio entered the room. Quinn started to ask them a few questions, mostly their personal rundown on what the tenths area used to be like before the attack. When it had been his turn, Timmy mentioned his idea about the armour sets.

"However, I don’t think it would work anymore." Timmy admitted. "I tried to do it before you arrived, but even with offering then an armour set as a reward no one was interested to move. They just don’t feel safe anymore."

"I don’t think that will be too much of a problem soon." Quinn said. "The only thing I need to do is increase my reputation with those in the tenth. Alex if you could, would you be able to create new equipment for the students here? As for Logan and Timmy. Try to head over to the pooling area and see if there is anything needing that can improve their lives, I’m sure Logan can come up with a few things."

"Then what do you need me for?" Timmy questioned.

"I mean, you know how charming Logan can be. I’d much rather have you there as the spokesperson. Also make sure that anyone who wishes to leave the castle, does so in at least a group of five. I want you to take three others with you and make sure to take your masks with you as well."

Before allowing the three of them to leave, Quinn decided to bring up the system and check out one more thing. In the system interface, there was now a section where he could assign quests to certain individuals.

To do that, he merely needed to set up an objective, optionally add a mission description, but most importantly had to assign the reward form his own items in the system.

’Oh neat, it also lets me use the items I have in my shadow space. Ok, let’s test it out with this.’ Quinn thought.

The instructions had also stated that if Quinn wanted to give the quest to a certain individual, then he could do so by using his inspect skill, then, when the information screen popped up, there was a little assign quest button underneath there name.

Quinn wrote up the quest for Alex to create armour for the students and then also created an additional one for Logan and Timmy.

’What should I put here? Uhmmm... Get to know the tenth family people better? Let’s see if the system accepts something vague like that...’ As a reward Quinn just put some high tier crystals and the quest was set.

"Whoa what the hell is this?!" Alex wondered out loud as he looked at the screen in front of him.

"What are you talking about?" Timmy asked since it looked like Alex was staring at nothing but air.

"Can’t you see it? This screen? It just appeared out of nowhere!" He started jumping up and down like a kid, despite it looking similar to the screens they used today. The only difference was this did feel a little like magic.

"Can you see the same thing in front of you Logan?" Quinn asked.

Logan didn’t have any reaction, but he did nod. He had seen this once before, and knew about Quinn having the system due to the two of them touching. However, Timmy was unable to see anything.

’Can only those turned see the system screen and quests? But then why did the quest not appear in front of Timmy?’ Checking the status of the quest it said that it was ongoing and Timmy had received one.

Moving on and past the excitement, Quinn made sure for them to deliver the message that the new tenth leader was the one that had sent them and asked to complete the task. As for Alex, Quinn opened up his dimensional space, and handed him a bunch of emperor tier crystals he could use to create equipment.

Something that had been given to them after the joint hunt from the demon tier beast, and some revived from the Pure planets and Daisy planets. Quinn thought they might have been a use for them so he brought them along.

Now all Quinn had to do was wait patiently, after waiting a while he received a few messages.

[Logan Green has completed the quest - rewards have been received]

[Timmy Sinblup has completed the quest - rewards have been received]

[The tenth’s family opinion of you has increased]

[400 reputation points gained]

And after that.

[Alex Way has completed the quest - rewards have been received]

[100 reputation points gained]

[For completing the following quests, the tenth family members are grateful]

[100 reputation points received]

[100 reputation points received]

[100 reputation points received]

[Total reputation points currently 900]

’Oh, I didn’t expect to get reputation points from them being happy about completing the quests! It looks like I got a hundred per person. I guess this title allowing me to assign quests isn’t so useless after all...’ Quinn smiled as he looked forward to upgrading some things around his castle.
