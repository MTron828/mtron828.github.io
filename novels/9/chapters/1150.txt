Chapter 1151 Best babysitter

Layla only noticed that someone had snuck up on her when that person whispered in her ear, and the contents of those words had made a shiver run down her spine. After all, there were only a few who knew of her past, and those that did that had good intentions, wouldn’t approach her in such a manner. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She was unsure what to do, should she turn around at that moment? Call for help from her fellow colleagues?

Judging by the way Fex was swinging his head and covering his ears, it didn’t seem like he had exactly noticed what was going on and the others also seemed completely focused on spectating the match before Quinn’s.

’Can I get their attention somehow, with my ability, maybe I can grab something and hit Fex or Sil.’ She thought.

"Don’t worry, if I wanted to harm you I would have done so already. I just couldn’t help my curiosity. Now why would the daughter of one of Pure’s founders be working for the person who had caused her death?" The person asked.

Layla could tell that the voice belonged to a male. Unfortunately there were far too many agents in Pure for her to figure out which one was behind her, with just the voice alone. Although to be this confident, it had to be a high ranking one, at least a numbered agent like herself of the past. For now, she was looking at her surroundings as she tried to come up with a plan in case that mysterious man changed his mind.

"Aren’t you the least bit ashamed of yourself? Your ’poor’ mother would be rolling around in her grave if she knew. She created Pure for a reason, but I guess by the fact that you are part of a faction of monsters you either don’t know about any of that... or you simply don’t care!"

The words struck a chord inside Layla.

"You know nothing about my mother!" Layla whispered back in anger, hoping to get the attention of someone, even if it was just one of the Earthborn groups. Something had been pressed against her back since the beginning of their conversation, which was why she didn’t dare to agitate the person behind her too much.

However, listening to these accusations, although they weren’t exactly wrong, she had to stand her ground. "That is something we can agree on. I wasn’t particularly close with your mother so I didn’t know her. However, I know of somebody who was close with her. Agent 2 is on this planet. If you want to know more, why don’t you follow me and ask him. I’m sure he would be happy to welcome back an Ex agent. Especially one with a close connection to our organization as you." The voice suggested and the next moment, Layla could no longer feel the pressure that was on her back.

She naturally turned around, hoping to look at the man and catch a glimpse of what he looked like, but he was nowhere in her vicinity.

’If he wasn’t lying and Pure really sent out such a high-ranking single numbered agent, then that means they are putting far more importance into capturing this Demi-god tier beast than we realised. Should I take his word for it? Can I just go off, to find out more about my mother... Agent 2 should be one of the first members of Pure, so he should surely know Mom created Pure in the first place... Can I really go when all of this points to a trap? Or would he hurt me somehow, mother is no longer there and she won’t have the power to protect me anymore. Not that she ever did in the first place.’ Layla was conflicted.

Just then, she saw a hooded man exit the area. He put up one hand and slowly put down a finger, one by one. Layla understood that this was a sign for her that he would leave in a matter of seconds, whether with or without her. However, by following him, she would leave Quinn and the others. Should she ask them to come along?

’It might be a big trap and if anything happens to me it will just cause more trouble for Quinn, but if Pure is planning to do something to me, he could have just attacked me there. Is there something that my mother still has a play in? did she ask someone to maybe still look out for me?’ She thought.

As the man started to leave, Layla had no choice but to move, still undecided. ’I’ll contact Quinn through the mask once his match is over, and he can come over then. If I’m there, maybe I can find out more information about the Demi-god tier beast from Pure. Without the need for fighting between the two groups. I know Quinn is strong, but he isn;t the only one Pure is fighting against and I don’t want anyone to get hurt if I can stop it.’

This was how Layla justified her action to herself, but in reality she just wanted to know more about her late mother, and Quinn didn’t need to be a part of that life. He had done enough for her already. She was also afraid that relying on him like so, would make her appear weak. She didn’t need looking after and she didn’t want Quinn to always babysit her actions.

However, there was one person who had noticed her leave the scene, and that was Logan who had little interest in the exhibition match.

’Layla, why don’t you ask us for help? I know what it feels like to want to do things on your own, but if you go out without telling anyone, it will just worry Quinn all the more. It’s dangerous to go alone, especially on an unknown planet.’

Following behind Layla, Logan was sure that something would happen, so he decided to keep up and close, only unlike her who had been pressed for time, he left behind a little spider.

Finally as the match started, the cheers started to die down, and Fex could hear freely again.

"Damn man, who knew a bunch of grown men could scream so high-pitched." Fex mumbled looking around and all he could see was a bored Sil, and Shiro who were by his side looking at the field.

"Hey, where the hell did the other two go?" Fex asked. He then noticed a small spider on the railing jumping up and down. Seeing this, he knew Logan must have left it behind and placed it on his mask.

"Logan, where the hell did you and Layla go?" Fex asked, worried what could be so important they couldn’t stay to watch Quinn’s match.

"Layla seems to be following someone at the moment, I’m just tagging along for back up. I’ve left one of my spiders with you. Once Quinn is finished beating the Colonel, just follow the spider to our location." Logan informed him.

"Wait just you two alone, don;t you need my help. What if there;s someone reallys torng the two of you can;t handle. Do you expect me to just stay here!" Fex started to shout at the railing. The ones close by were looking at him as if he had gone mad, since they were unable to see the spider. Even if they could, they would have thought he had gone crazy.

Regardless, his words had gone unheard for Logan had already ended the call.

’Should I go anyway, I mean I know Quinn will be able to handle himself, and there are others that can cheer him on.’ Fex thought.

Looking to his left and right, he could see Shiro and Sil, just casually talking to each other. Sil who was an unstable person who could probably destroy the whole shelter if someone got on his bad side, and Shiro who if others knew his ability would try to target him. That’s when Fex realised.

’Did they just leave me with babysitter duty?’
