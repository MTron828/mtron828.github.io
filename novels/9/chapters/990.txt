Chapter 991 - Best in the world

Not too long ago, Aden had gone running out of the classroom and had left Quinn’s beast class in control of the other students. His reasoning for doing this was because of the call he had received, informing him that the teacher ’Hardy’ Had finally returned and would be taking over the beast class lessons again.

Thinking that his days of teaching the class were over, he rushed out personally to find Hardy. That’s when Quinn had finally returned to see his students in their current state.

Venus had done as asked and went ahead to take Shiro to the doctor. However, there was still half of the lesson left. Quinn knew that the incidents wouldn’t stop, and dealing with one problematic student wouldn’t stop what went on between students.

’So they decided that all these kids will be fighting against the other beast classes. I wonder how much they have progressed?’ Quinn thought.

"I’m sorry I have been away for a while. I had some important matters to attend to." Said Quinn. "I have heard about the upcoming beast class event. If you guys can, feel free and show me what you have learnt over these past few days."

The idea was to get the students to try to forget about what happened, call them down, and see where they were currently. The atmosphere in the room was heavy, and one of Quinn’s speeches wasn’t going to fix that.

Eventually, the students grabbed their weapons and attempted to activate them, while others seemingly had given up and just practised improving the skills with the weapons.

Walking around, Quinn went to those that seemed to have a hang of activating the beast weapon and decided to give them a few more tips. In the past, when Quinn had first touched a beast weapon, his system had activated it all for him, but learning Qi helped him understand the process more.

With the second stage of Qi, Quinn could feel those who were able to summon the energy to use beast weapons, but something wasn’t quite there. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He knew of a way to help them but was careful. What Quinn was careful of, was touching the students in case he turned them accidentally.

’Maybe, it won’t be a problem anymore. I can not only control the Qi energy but my red aura as well, perhaps..’ Quinn thought, as he walked up to a student who was close to activating his weapon and had their eyes closed.

Quinn placed a single finger on the back of his shoulder, closed his eyes and could feel his energy. Immediately it looked like the red energy was attempting to do what it did best, entering the human’s energy and taking it over, but Quinn had practised controlling it, and with his new Blood control stats. He was able to move it away, eventually switching it out, and placed a small bit of his regular Qi into a student.

"Can you feel the warm bit of energy that has entered your body? That energy is mine. I can tell you have a sense of feeling for yourself already. You need to follow that energy, and you will be able to activate the weapon." Quinn explained.

A few seconds later, the students had activated the beast weapon and felt the power energising his body. Not wanting to touch the student for longer, he let go of him, just in case something went wrong.

"I did it!" The student yelled. "I finally activated the beast weapon."

Everyone could see the student shouting with joy and the teacher Hardy behind him. So many of them had struggled for so long, and after one lesson of Hardy returning, a student was successful in activating their beast weapon.

"Is he a miracle worker? Maybe he can help me as well?"

"Ah man, I liked Aden at first, but he turned out to be an arse." Another student commented.

Soon, all the students were calling Quinn, asking him to help them out next, but there were over a hundred students, and some of them weren’t quite at the stage this student was.

’Even if they all learn to activate their soul weapons, they won’t be ready for the fight in time. I need to do something else.’ Quinn started to think.

’Don’t you think what you had done was a little dangerous?’ Vincent asked. ’Touching that boy, you could have turned him here in front of everyone.’

’I know, which is why I only helped him activate the weapon and not anything else. Perhaps if I was to move the boy’s Qi, the red aura would try to act more widely, but I have been practising my control of the blood and Qi energy every day. It seems after the blood control stats improved, I can control it pretty well now.’ Quinn replied.

Going around, Quinn helped more students that were already close to activating their weapon, but after just a couple more, the class was over, and they only had a total of three days until the event was to start.

Sitting in his homeroom class, Quinn started to think about what would be the best thing to do. While doing so, he had a visit from one of his students.

"I brought him here because I thought you should know he is all healed up," Hayley said, as she pushed Shiro forward. She looked at Hardy for a few seconds and wondered if she should warn him about how the other teachers were planning something.

’No, it’s not my place to get involved. Those generals aren’t idiots. They wouldn’t do something that would hurt the students.’ Hayley thought and was off.

"Shiro, you are free to go as well you know? You don’t have to give me a report. Swin and Venus already explained what happened." Quinn said.

However, Shro stood there by the door, not moving forward. Although Shiro and Quinn were similar in many ways, Shiro lacked the confidence that Quinn had. Maybe Quinn would have been the same if he had never gotten the system, just getting frustrated more and more as he felt helpless each time he was beaten.

Standing up out of his seat, he started to walk over to Shiro.

"You know, when I went to military school, I also joined the beast class, and although you were in a bad state, I believe I was in an even worse state than you. I had been stabbed right through my stomach. The other students had staged it to look like an accident, but luckily the teacher I had at the time knew otherwise."

"Stabbed, really?" Shiro thought, imagining the pain. "How did you survive that?"

"You know who I am now, so you should also know that I’m not that much older than yourself. I just look kind of old. The doctor I had when I attended school is the same one that you have now."

The more Shiro learned about Quinn, the more he couldn’t believe it. Of course, after he had found out that Hardy was actually the leader of the Cursed faction, Shiro went to do his research. A student who had no ability rose to the top in such a short amount of time.

It was a tale one would only read in fairy tales. It just seemed impossible.

"Teacher...please can you teach me the shadow. I promise I will be in your debt and will join the Cursed faction. I just...want to have a better life than I have now. Where I don’t have to worry about someone else attacking me."

Quinn could understand the frustration, but teaching Shiro, a student the shadow now, would bring him more trouble. Maybe he could teach it to him when he actually did join the Cursed faction and was onboard the Cursed ship.

For Quinn knew there were hungry people out there who wanted to get this power for themselves.

"I can’t teach you the shadow," Quinn said. "But maybe I can teach you something else."

——

The next day, early morning during Quinn’s break periods, he figured out a way to help all of the students. Not just learn about activating the best weapon but also how to get better at fighting with the weapon they were using.

"Of course you can," Oscar said. "You should never be shy about this sort of thing. If you can do anything to make these students stronger and their lives better, then go ahead."

With the request made, it was now time for the beast class to start again. The students heading towards the class were more excited than usual, having their teacher back, and some of them thought that Hardy could help teach all of them how to activate their weapons.

However, there were digital posters and advertis.e.m.e.nts splattered throughout about the big event of the beast classes in the hallways. They were inviting anyone to watch. It reminded them that even if they did learn how to activate their weapons, it wouldn’t be enough for them to win.

"Hey, do you think Hardy will teach us first if we ask him nicely?" Swin asked.

"There are too many students, though. He only got through a few yesterday. Even if we have the whole lesson time today, I just don’t think he will be able to see everyone." Venus replied.

When the two of them walked forward, the door slid open. All of the students were stunned at what they were looking at. They were still standing outside and hadn’t gone in because they were unsure about what was happening.

"Don’t be shy, come on in, we don’t have time to waste. For the next couple of days. Everyone here will be your teacher and will teach you to use your weapons." Quinn explained while standing in front of those in the Cursed faction.

Quinn had decided to invite those in the Cursed faction that were excellent at using beast weapons, and they would teach the student one on one, the best way to use them.

"Each one of these are high ranking faction members from all over, from Daisy, the Black rings, and even those personally under the Cursed faction." Quinn said, pointing at Wevil, who was holding two daggers. "Now, let’s get on with it, shall we."

"I think we might have the best teacher in the world," Venus said.
