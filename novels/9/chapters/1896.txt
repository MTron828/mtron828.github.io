Chapter Ôªø1897 Protecting Mars (Part 1)

In Quinn's mind it was a fair deal. Due to the position that Andy was in, he couldn't just leave his post. Being in charge of a large organization in the past had taught Quinn that, and if someone had asked him the same things his response would have been similar.

Although, in the past he had one of the best men in the world helping him out‚Ä¶ and the mystery of what happened to him, and where he was or where he went was still unknown.

"So what do you want me to do, or when do we get to work?" Quinn asked.

Andy was surprised that Quinn was so eager to get into action. At the same time, he never thought that he would get such help from such a person. In his mind, he was trying to weigh Quinn's strength and in doing so figuring out how exactly he could help.

"I still have a lot to do in the bases themselves like I said, so honestly we haven't been able to find out why the waves of beasts have become more frequent and worse, in terms of power.

"The land that is open on the outside, less and less travelers are going out there. Maybe I could organize a team for you to try to find the cause of this."

For Quinn, it didn't matter the reason, but the solution. Hordes of beasts came from Nest crystals, so if he was to find the nest crystals and get rid of them that would be his answer.

"Don't get rid of all the nest crystals." Andy stated as he could tell what the other was thinking. "I don't know what it was like during your time, but the use of Beast crystal energy is immense for us.

"They power nearly everything and our everyday things. Without beasts, not just this planet but other planets will really struggle. We just want the tier of beasts to lessen so our cities and manpower can handle it."

The task might seem somewhat impossible, Andy knew that, but this was the great hero they were talking about. Solving this problem would be nothing compared to the great Dalki.

One of Andy's 100 squad commanders had been called in. It was one that was a similar rank of Mitchell, who had also stayed behind in Green city for now, had come to collect Quinn.ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

There were quite a few people that knew who Quinn was in the higher ranks of the Vampire corps, because there were those that had travelled with Mitchell at that time, and they had seen everything.

However, Quinn's return was never spread due to the fear and power shifting it might cause. Still, those worries from before were dwindling. Dhampir attacks were practically unheard of at the moment, and Pure had been dealt a huge blow that most thought they would never be able to recover from.

Either way, the man in front of them, with short spiked up hair and a beret hat, was Arad Buckley.

"It's a pleasure to meet you sir!" Arad bowed down and lifted his head saluting Quinn, while then pointing to those that were by his side. "Andy has told me to treat you with the utmost respect as you are our honoured guest.

"He has also explained that you will be going out to try and help us in finding out the reason for the Beast waves. I thank you for your cooperation."

The men couldn't help but look at Quinn up and down. His skin was crystal clear, his appearance was one of a calm face, and he was quite the looker. None of those in the vampire corps could even imagine that this person in front of them was able to be much help.

'He must be some type of high ranking official in the Green City that happens to be a vampire or something. Coming along to show that they have attempted to help.'

A lot of vampires were critical of those that lived in Green City. Because the vampire corps was the place where vampires were meant to be. Humans were accepted but in the corps unit itself it was 90 percent vampires.

Those that joined Green City or ran off to the Graylash planets were often criticized in the vampire corps for not trying to fight and support their own kind. They felt that even the Red Vampires had more backbone.

At the same time, they had always felt that the vampire corps did a lot more to help Green City, then they did to help them. Once in a while token gestures such as Jake Green or people like this that were in front of them would be sent out for help, but it wasn't enough.

On top of that, there was one thing that was concerning for them all, and that was the fact that there was a young vampire girl that was travelling with the man and holding onto his leg.

"Erghh‚Ä¶ Sir, will she also be coming along with us?" One of the men asked.

Arad wasn't too sure and looked at Quinn for an answer. Although Andy had told him that his name was Buinn, so no one in the room at the moment was aware of who he was.F

"She will be coming with us, but don't worry about her. I hear she is quite capable of handling herself, and if worst comes to worst I will protect her. Each of you can be concerned with protecting your own life." Quinn answered.

Since that matter was somewhat resolved, although from the look on the others' faces they couldn't believe it, Arad decided to continue.

'If that young girl dies then we're the ones that are going to get all of the blame for this!' One of them inwardly complained, and it wasn't too far off from the others' thoughts. Why in a mission like this had a little vampire been asked to come along.

"These people here are my best men from my hundred man squad. I would say with all of us together we are even capable of taking out a demon tier beast if we were to come across one."

"Have you ever fought against a demon tier beast?" Quinn asked.

"No we have not!" Liam was the one who answered who looked the youngest of the vampires in the squad.

Hearing the answer Quinn shook his head slightly, because he knew anyone who fought against a demon tier beast would never say that. Their strength varied greatly. At one point, the world's strongest were gathered to take on a demon tier beast.

Then there was the dragon, all of the vampires including some of the originals had been woken up to attempt to take that down, but the more Quinn thought about it, he assumed the Dragon had to be at the Godslayer level rather than the Demon tier level. It was just that his system was unable to recognize such things before.

"Have you?" Liam asked. "Have you ever taken on a demon tier beast?"

The other corps members were smirking hearing the question asked. It was fair for him to criticize their work but not hear it from the others. Quinn's silence on the matter just made the others more confident expecting that Buinn was just all talk.

Just as the group were getting ready to leave, a sound had been heard throughout the building. A constant alarm that was going off.

"What is that?" Quinn asked.

"It's the beast waves‚Ä¶ it means they're attacking right now." Arad replied with his eyebrows furrowed inward. "At a time like this, this is why we have to complete our mission."

The group all looked frustrated, and started to continue to pack their supplies.

"What are you doing?" Quinn asked. "Shouldn't we go help get rid of the wave?"

"Andy stated that no matter what was to occur we were to go with you and help complete this task." Arad replied.

"Yes, but he also said that you were to assist me at all times right. Well then, I will be going to the front line to fight off the wave, so you have no choice but to come." Quinn replied, as he walked away, and started to head towards the wall.

For a second, the rest of the group looked at each other, and started to regret their thoughts from before. Even if he was weak, he surely wasn't spineless and thought about what they wanted.

"That man‚Ä¶ is not bad." Liam smiled.
