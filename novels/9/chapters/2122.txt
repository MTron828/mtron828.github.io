Ceril didn't have the direct coordinates to the Mermerial planet, but only the flight path of the Marpo Cruise ships. At first, there was a thought that this might be risky, as it was quite possible that they would run into one of the Marpo Cruise ships, and right now they were trying to stay undetected.

During her research though, she had stumbled across some more information that had been sent over. It was the fact that the Marpo Cruise ships weren't currently in operation.

The business seemed to be on pause. There were a couple of guesses as to why this might be, one of them being the fact that Jack and Jim had started a war with the Namriks, but Quinn only remembered seeing two of the cruise ships, so where were the others. Unfortunately, there was no information regarding that.

The flight as expected wasn't a short one by any means, but they had been provided with a number of high tier beast crystals to be used as fuel, so they felt like in this department there would be no problems, it was just a simple waiting game now.

"Ah, I think I recognise that moon over there. I should be able to get us to the general area." Ceril stated, as she took over the controls and started to do a scan with the ship.

It was only a matter of time now until she would be back on her home planet. There were a lot of memories in her head, and she was waiting to know which one of these were true or not.

'The Mermerial planet, we're nearly there.' Quinn thought, looking out into space. 'I still have to be a little careful here as well. The celestial that covers this planet is the one named Yongbu. Although he did help us get to Earth last time, I am no longer a celestial.

'Whether the celestials know this or not is another thing, but if he sees me and reports this, then it may very well cause trouble.'

However, Quinn wasn't sure if the celestials already knew about this or not, because Quinn had met with the Namrik celestial and eliminated him. There wasn't a chance for the celestial to be sent back, but they had to be aware of what happened.

Quinn was right in his thoughts, because the celestials were very aware of the disappearance of the said celestial.

Mundus was in the celestial space, sitting in his made chair. He was in his physical form, one of the few that could enter the space in such a way. While sitting down, there were several floating orbs around him.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Flashing with images of parts of planets. They were different due to the orbs of energy that would be said planets, it was more a small taste. The universe was large, too large for Mundus to look over everything that was happening.

Celestials would disappear all the time, rejoining the reincarnation cycle, and god slayers would pop up all over the place. Unless it was considered a major problem, Mundus and the Ancient Ones would leave everything to be dealt with by the celestials in the area.

For the most part, this would work out, with only little intervention needed, but there was a troublesome area that was annoying Mundus somewhat.

'Why do those humans have to cause so much trouble!' Mundus sighed to himself. 'There has been a sharp rise of those with god slayer status. On top of that, it seems like they are spreading out from their area. They are like a virus...'

Due to a promise that had been made with a certain celestial, Mundus hadn't been keeping an eye on Earth and those around it too much, but still asked to get reports from the others.

It was common practice to get reports from Earth due to Immortui being from there. The Ancient Ones always feared that he would be plotting something.

Which was why he had decided to have a messenger gather information for him, one of the best celestials.

"Are you satisfied with the report sir?" Xox asked, the floating ball of energy.

"It will have to do." Mundus replied. "It is a shame that no one was looking over the Namrik planet, but we never expected the humans to expand so far."

Moving his hand, Mundus brought up an orb and could see the current situation on the planet.

"I can sense a few with god slayer powers in the area. I sent a celestial to deal with them before but it didn't turn out well. They must be relatively strong. Very well, Xox, keep an eye on the humans' movements. Get the help of another celestial to watch Earth as well, we can't drop the ball on this one."

Xox nodded, unsure whether the last line was meant to be a joke or not. He was thinking of laughing to please Mundus but played it safe, as he whisked away to do as he was asked.

'Why are there so many problems with those from earth?'

There was a hypothesis that was going through Mundus' head. It was most likely because Immortui was sealed away that these god slayers were able to rise. Normally they would be dealt with, and now the situation was getting out of hand.

'It seems like the Ancient Ones are storing up their power, just in case there is a big battle with Immortui in the future. So they don't want to directly get involved.

'It's the same for myself though, I used up a lot of power in my last fight. I don't know why but I have a bad feeling about those from earth. If I was to fight them, I might need to be at my very best.'

Mundus had already sent out some of his fighting celestials the last time to deal with those from Earth and had failed. He feared that if he was to do the same again that it would be the same result.

The celestials had faith in him and the Ancient Ones, because so far most of them were able to live a satisfying life, satisfying their conditions, but sending them to their death would cause more problems for them, and the Universe was unpredictable.

If the balance was swayed in one direction, Mundus was trying to wonder what it would attempt to do, to correct it.

'A powerful being that will listen to what I say, and is up for the task.' Mundus was thinking hard, and a solution soon had arrived. Before doing this, he needed to check with a certain group of people, and soon his seat as well as his own body was disappearing from the space.

——

"We… approve of the plan, but if they end up causing trouble, then you will be the one responsible and will need to deal with it, do you understand." A deep voice that sounded neither high pitched or low pitched, it almost switched as it spoke.

"I understand." Mundus bowed down. He then swung his arm, and a line was visible in the air. Soon after he stepped through it, moving his body into another area again.

'Hopefully this will resolve everything. He has listened to us before, and as long as the deal is favourable to him he should accept.' Mundus thought. 'Quinn, you have proven yourself before, and I'm sure we can use you again. If you are successful, then the Ancient Ones have agreed that they will let you live free, as long as you are kept under watch.'

Mundus was confident in his plan, and all he needed to do now was to talk to the person in question. Soon he had entered a certain space, it was nothing but white inside.

As he stood there, he started to look left and right. He twisted and turned his head, but was unable to see anything.

"Quinn…" Mundus called out. "Quinn!" he shouted out a bit louder this time, trying to get a response, but there was nothing.

'That's impossible… did he escape?'
