The final and last event was to begin, and for the Dark Reds there was a lot on the line. Surprisingly, when Quinn came out, there were quite a lot of cheers for him.

After seeing what the last alien had done, they were anticipating seeing a good display for the final event. Although they all thought that it was clear who the winner would be, and unfortunately back in the Dark Reds' room they also felt like they already knew who the winner was.

"I just hope he tries his best." The coach commented.

"Hey!" Russ said, finally standing up and watching the screen. Are you counting Quinn out, if you are then I would say you are quite the fool."

The coach was taken back by the words, but with what he had seen Quinn do, he couldn't imagine him winning. He had seen Quinn's speed and he doubted that it was faster than Stark's.

Even in this event, if they were allowed to strike their enemy, how would he strike something that he was unable to hit. On top of that, due to how the event worked and unlike the other events, only one team was able to get points, the winner.

"I'm telling you now, if Quinn is willing to do anything to win this, then it's impossible for him to lose." Russ stated.

Once again, those running the event had decided to put the alien, Quinn, alongside their star, Stark, as they expected some interesting side by side work for the event.

There were a lot of different strategies for this game, saving one's energy until the last moment. Then while the leader of the game got tired, they could use all their strength and speed to snatch the item.

Another tactic was not touching the item but protecting it, then there were those that perhaps would decide to work in groups to start with.

However, playing against Stark changed all of that, because once he got the item and stuck it to his body, no one would be able to touch him to get it off.

'The arena is quite large so there is a lot of space to move, but with fifty other people all going for one person, it could cause a few accidents.' Quinn thought as he was thinking to himself.Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

"It's nice to meet you." Stark said, as he continued to do his stretches and look Quinn up and down. "The last one, your friend, he did really well. It caught me by surprise and excited me quite a bit."

"Friend?" Quinn replied, but thought it was best if he didn't say anything more on that matter. "Ah yes, he did better than I thought he would do as well."

"I hope you don't disappoint me." Stark continued, but I just want to give you a warning. If you do the same as the last person it won't really help you in this event. Having more people on your side is not going to work.

"You see, there are already people forming groups to work against me, but it's all the same. They won't win this event, unless they are able to touch me or are faster than me."

Quinn mostly ignored Stark, as he looked at the timer, there was preparation time for the event. It looked like it was done on purpose so the other groups could talk and team up with each other. For him, he was thinking of the best way to do this.

"Aren't you going to transform into a Penswi, like your friend did? There isn't much time left." Stark asked.

"Ah‚Ä¶ I can't do that, that is something that's just special to him." Quinn answered. "I will just do as you said, win this event with speed."

There was nothing else Stark could say, as the event was about to start, but he believed that talk was cheap, and he would show just what he could do in this event.

'I am a bit disappointed, I was hoping to have someone else push me‚Ä¶ so I could reach the next level of speed.' Stark thought.

*BEEP

The sound went off, and nearly everyone went running straight toward the centre, it was a small bright green object that was around the same size as a ball.

Of course, the one who was ahead of everyone and had reached the target first was Stark. He lifted it off the ground and had already stuck it on the centre of his chest.

As soon as this had occurred, the other contestants stopped for a second as they started to think about what was the best thing to do.

"Maybe we should wait."

"But if we all wait it will be useless, Stark is just standing there in the centre right now. So he will have plenty of energy. If no one tires him out, then what's the point?" Another contestant complained.

The problem was, no one wanted to volunteer for attempting to catch Stark to try and tire him out, otherwise it would mean they were giving up their chance at winning this event.

While all the others were bickering with each other, one person walked forward toward Stark but soon stopped.

"I thought you said you were going to win this with speed, but it looked like you didn't even try running to get this back there." Stark said.

"I was a little bit worried." Quinn answered. "You see, I'm trying to figure out how to win this game without hurting anyone, but I think I have my answer."

Quinn moved his hands in a circle, nothing visible had come out of them, there was no vampire aura, there was no shadow either, but almost at the exact time of moving his hands, the other contestants collapsed onto the floor.

Some fell instantly, while others were on their feet for a few seconds, but eventually all of them were on the floor on the outside of the ring.

The King and Queen immediately stood up from their seats as they saw this, as there was great concern as to what was going on.

"They have only passed out!" Quinn shouted, so everyone could hear loud and clear. "They are not harmed, I would never do such a thing on your planet, but I wish to face Stark on my own!"

There were no rules against fighting against an opponent, but there were rules about killing. There seemed to be a device set up on each of the contestants so once it was confirmed they were still alive the King and Queen were a little more settled.

"What did you do?" Stark asked surprised, as he looked left and right, even behind him, everyone had collapsed, but then why hadn't he? If he had collapsed as well, his opponent could have taken the tag and won the game.

"It's one of my powers, it was a guess that you guys don't react too well to Qi." Quinn explained.

He had used the third stage of Qi, but not in a deadly way. The Qi was to go through the body and overload the brain to cause it to pass out like so. Of course, if the other person was adept in Qi this wouldn't work, and in the first place, to do it on a large scale like this, to so many people, one would need a lot of Qi which Quinn had.

In the Dark Red room, the others were a little bit confused as well.

"Why‚Ä¶ why did his power not work on Stark, did he avoid it somehow?" Jun asked.

Unlike the others Jun wasn't so surprised to see what Quinn could do, because he had seen the person do even crazier things.

"Because he's a fool." Russ said. "He missed Stark on purpose."

Inside the arena Quinn was ready to give his answer.

"I will win this match with my speed, I want to see how fast you can go. So let's get our legs moving shall we?" Quinn smiled.
