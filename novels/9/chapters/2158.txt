The good news was it seemed like celestials were unable to tell what Galen was without being so close to him, otherwise he would have already had quite a few of them on his back already, but then it begged the question‚Ä¶

Why was Mundus here? He had stated that it was clear, he was here waiting for him, which had led him to his family, and right now, in a way Mundus was kind of being nice. He had given Quinn information that there was no need for him to have.

If he was really here to punish him for breaking out of that prison, then there was no need for him to do any of this.

"There are a few things that I didn't expect before this meeting, and one of them is the fact that you are now a god slayer." Mundus placed his hand on his head as if it was troublesome and his strange ears that would curl and move were curling more towards his forehead.

"Either way, it wasn't as if we counted on you to do celestial things anyway, heck we even locked you away." Mundus mumbled to himself as he cleared his thoughts. "I'm sorry to disturb you and your family, taking you away from your travels, but your hometown earth has been causing quite a few problems.

"You see, the last time you helped us out, we had made a deal, and that was that we wouldn't get involved with Earth. However, there seems to be a slight problem. You see, since we have left things on their own, there has been a sharp increase of God slayers that has continued to increase. This isn't so much of a problem on its own, but it seems these god slayers and earthlings have been expanding through the Universe and now this has become a problem."

It didn't take a scientist to figure out what Mundus was talking about, it had to be Jack and Jim. The fact that they had caught the attention of the celestials. Quinn was inwardly smiling as he imagined Jim and Jack were making enemies without realising it.

"You see, we celestials, although recently have gotten involved quite a bit, don't usually like to get involved a lot. Because we believe that the Universe will have its own way of solving things, but we have meddled, since a long time ago when we decided to seal away Immortui.

"I do believe if Immortui was still around that this matter would have never gotten to be as big of a problem as it is now. Which is a good example of our involvement."

The way the conversation was stirring, Quinn was no longer inwardly happy anymore. It sounded like the celestials didn't want to do anything at all, and if his guess was right‚Ä¶

"This is why, we would like to ask you for another favour, and wish for you to put a stop to the god slayers that are coming from your planet. Stop them from expanding out and destroying other races." Mundus requested.

In some ways Quinn couldn't believe it. One moment they trap him for all eternity asking him to have no involvement, and now they were asking for his help?

"I can guess what you are thinking and trust me, it's quite embarrassing for the celestial community as a whole. It is times like this where I am happy that I am but a simple messenger." Mundus continued.

"As you know, we did strike a deal last time, and I wish to be fair to you and strike a deal with you again. If you complete this task, we will forget the fact that you are a god slayer. We will see you more as an agent that has done good work for the celestials.

"After all, you have seen our half, so it's not as if you are a direct enemy. This means of course, you can go ahead and enjoy the happy life, that you wish to have, as long as you complete this task. You were one of the strongest celestials and I have no doubt that you are strong as a god slayer as well. There would be few that could do a task like this. Which is why we are prepared to give you such a high reward.

"But I can't lie. The position as an agent of the celestials will mean that maybe in the future we will ask you to do tasks such as this one, but I promise we will only ask you of such tasks if we believe you are one of the few that can complete it, we won't just call you to do things here and there."

Mundus stated that it was a request but really what choice did he have? If he was to say no, then what? Would Mundus proceed to fight him and his whole family, would Quinn have to take on the ancient ones?

'If I think about it, it's not too bad of a deal. I wanted to deal with the problems anyway, and the celestials are saying that I get something out of this for completing it. Being an agent of thiers, I no longer have to go in hiding, or hide my powers when I am on other planets now as well.' Quinn thought.

"I agree." Quinn said. "But I want a bit more out of this deal. Since the last time I accepted something like this it didn't turn out so well for me. I want my son to be protected at all costs. For his secret to be kept secret, and if it does come out, that you will do everything in your power to protect him."

Mundus looked at Galen for a few moments, even while they were talking now, he had the shadow flickering around him. They had been talking for a while, so it seemed he could use the shadow a bit better than his older sister.

"Agreed, but I can only try my best." Mundus answered. "The best thing will be for you to stay by his side, or to increase his own strength so he can defend himself."

"I have another request." Quinn asked. "If the celestials are asking me to do such a big thing, then it's only right that they help me out in this fight. You want to guarantee that I accomplish this mission, then help me."

"I already said, the celestials don't wish to get involved. We are worried about what it might do." Mundus explained. "Celestials, when moving from their original condition, seem to cause the most problems and unless we send in the stronger celestials they really won't be much help to you. The fact that your a god slayer now makes things quite a bit easier."

Quinn was going to ask for help, having Mundus by his side. The two of them working together would surely be a combo that no one could deal with, but if he couldn't get that, then he did have another request.

"Your role in the celestial space is the messenger, and I'm sure that means you're pretty high up and have lived for a really long time. So you must have seen quite a lot of things and know quite a lot.

"So, if you can't help me in this fight, then you should at least support me. Give me some armour, the best armour you know, the best armour you have which will help me deal with the problem." Quinn asked.

The chair started to sink down into the ice, and Mundus stood up from his position. He then clicked his fingers, and everything around started to move again. The air, the clouds above, Wince, and Minny.

They all looked in front of them, and suddenly they could see Quinn standing there. They were greatly confused because they hadn't seen him rise from a shadow or anything like that.

"That is something I can do for you, but we don't have much time, so let's get moving."
