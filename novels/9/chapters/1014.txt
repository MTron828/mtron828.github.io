Chapter 1015 - The Noble vampire

Inside the Shelter Fex and Samantha were left standing there looking at the destroyed house in front of them. The onlookers that had gone away for a few seconds, soon returned to have a look once again.

However, making sure no one was being nosy with what was going on, Samantha quickly built two walls at the end of the street so no onlookers would come to where they were. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

"Okay, it’s time for you to explain yourself." Samantha said.

"Me explain myself, what do you mean by that?" Fex asked. He thought he had just gotten out of the fiery pit of trouble, and now someone else was giving him a grilling.

’When I wanted an adventure this wasn’t what I had In mind.’ Fex thought.

"What I’m talking about is what that stranger was saying. He was saying some things that sounded a bit odd, as if he knew you? At least he made it out that way." Samantha questioned.

"How am I meant to know what he meant?" Fex said, getting defensive and moving away from Samantha. "There’s a bunch of crazy people in this world. He literally slammed a glass on my hand out of nowhere."

Seeing Fex lift up his hand to show the wound, Samantha looked at it strangely, scrunching up her face, because she saw no such wound on his hand at all. It looked completely fine.

"I’m starting to think maybe you’re the crazy one, when I get back I’m going to request that a psych evaluation be put on all our teachers to check your mental health. We can’t have someone like you teaching our students. What do you even teach anyway?"

Even though Fex thought he was a little in the wrong for what had happened, he started to get annoyed at how this girl was treating him.

"Look out!" Fex shouted, using his strings, he soon wrapped Samantha up in them and pulled her towards him, carrying her under his arm. A few seconds later and a loud bang was heard. Following it, a violent shake of the ground with parts of dirt falling from the sky like it was raining.

When the shaking had stopped and the rain of dirt ended, she could see that her and Fex were on a house roof quite away from where they were before.

’How did we get up here so fast?’ She thought, but soon her thoughts were concentrated on something else.

"What is that black egg looking thing?" Fex asked, looking down at the destroyed Shelter. It wasn’t just where they were, there were five space pods in total that had landed in different places around the Shelter. Causing a large crater and destroying everything within thirty meters as it landed.

A few seconds later, and a piercing siren noise sounded, going off. Loud enough for everyone in the Shelter to hear.

"What’s that sound?" Fex asked, still startled at everything happening.

"Didn’t you go to school, and you’re a teacher!" Samantha said annoyedly, hitting Fex on his t.h.i.g.h so he could set her free. "That sound, it means the Dalki have arrived. The Dalki are attacking!"

The sounds of screams filled the air, from panic, as they headed to the emergency protection zones, and Samantha, just hearing them started sweating frantically. In the distance she could see mechs being piloted, landing where the other pods were. She then jumped down from the building, and created a platform for herself with her ability, moving it towards the black pod.

She got in a fighting stance and was ready. The black pod started to produce steam as its front doors were being opened up. She knew how hard the outside of the Dalki sh.i.p.s were and the pod looked to be made of the same material. It was pointless to attack such a thing, but she was prepared.

Then, when the door started to lift itself open, a hand could be seen reaching out with a claw on the end, it pushed itself forward and its large body with its scale-like features could be seen.

’That thing, it looks like Borden, so these are the Dalki that Quinn is always talking about. If they are as strong as Borden, and there are five of them. We’re in trouble.’ Fex thought.

As soon as its upper body was out from the shell, Samantha moved all nine of her sharp tails and shot them straight towards the Dalki. The tips of her tails suddenly changed a slight colour as she activated her soul weapon wasting no time.

The Dalki still wasn’t completely free from whatever it was trying to get out of, and was a sitting duck to the spikes as each one pierced its body. Green blood then started to ooze from the attack, and it shouted in pain.

"You bitch!" The Dalki g.r.o.a.n.e.d and soon kicked open the bottom part. It was at this point that Fex noticed the strange egg looked like a type of ship inside, but the black material was something similar to what the vampires would use as well.

What was strange, was even though the Dalki was full of holes and the tales had impaled its body, it was smiling. At that point, it lifted its arms and swung them down smashing all of the tails, breaking them leaving the pointed parts in its body. Pulling one of them out that had dug into its shoulder, it threw it towards Samantha, and then pulled out the rest, throwing them all towards her.

Her own attack was being used against her. Raising a wall was the only thing she could do, but the attacks had gone through them all, which came as a surprise to her, but the very last wall it looked like it was losing momentum.

"No you idiot, the Dalki is still coming towards you!" Fex shouted as a fist was seen breaking through the last wall, ready to grab Samantha, but she suddenly felt her back bend slightly, it wasn’t an action of her own, and the Dalki could now see some red string wrapped around its hand.

"Screw you!’ Fex shouted, pulling himself towards the Dalki, and kicking it in the c.h.e.s.t away from Samantha. It stumbled a little backwards, but soon pulled on the red strings that Fex was using, dragging his body upright.

The two of them now were in a tug of war match with Fex’s string, with the Dlaki’s hard skin the string was unable to pierce through like it would usually do, as for Fex, although the string was being produced from his fingers, he felt like his hand was going to snap off at any second.

’He’s holding his own in a battle of strength against a Dalki?’ Samantha thought.

A human couldn’t match the strength of the Dalki. Even some with the best gear couldn’t, so how could an ordinary teacher.

What she was surprised at was how her initial attack hadn’t killed the Dalki in the first place.

If it was coming from another earth user she would understand, but Samantha was a head general. One of the strongest people the military had to offer. If they couldn’t kill a Dalki, the human race would have already lost this war. When looking at the Dalki closely, that’s when she noticed it wasn’t a one spiked Dalki, but two.

Soon, Fex knew he would be pulled forward so he had no choice.

"Hey, can you promise me something, you have to keep this a secret okay?!" Fex grunted, and then with his other hand free, he fired off a single large blood swipe towards the Dalki. Taking the hit on, it pierced the Dalki’s skin slightly. While having the Dalki in place, Fex continued to use the red aura strings on the Dalki.

It was risk he had to take. He knew the opponent in front of him couldn’t be beaten with just his physical strength and string. He needed to use his abilities.

The red strike hit the Dalki again and again, and more blood was being split, but Fex just felt that the tugging was getting stronger, not weaker. Eventually, he had no choice but to let go of the string holding the Dalki.

"This guy just won’t fall. He was already injured by you? What’s it going to take to kill this guy?!" Fex said.

"Watch out!" Samantha shouted, but it was too late. The Dalki had already hit Fex straight in the face, sending his body flying and hitting a building crashing through the walls.

Seeing it, Samantha partly felt like it was her fault. After her initial attack had failed, she had done nothing to help while he was busy fighting. But it was safe to say that no human would be able to recover from something like that.

The two spiked Dalki, now on the verge of death, were moving faster and stronger than ever.

"ARGHH!" Samantha screamed as she summoned the nine tails again and attempted to hit the Dalki. Still, it managed to avoid the first two attacks and avoided the sharp coloured tips. It then punched the earth part of the tails, destroying them.

The Dalki had already figured out that only her soul weapon, part of her ability, was what managed to injure it.

’A two spiked Dalki, are the rest of them two spiked as well? Why would they send such a large force to deal with us? On a small planet like this?’

Not giving up, Samantha summoned her tails again, draining her of her MC points. She attempted to move her tips faster, then when all nine of them came at the Dalki at the same time, she saw something else speed past her.

The Dalki smashed through all of the tails with his hand, but a black haired young man, with a black needle in his hand, had pierced the Dalki right in the stomach. Soon it started to fill up with green liquid.

Taking the needle out, she was wondering what the young man was going to do next, lifting up the needle, he stabbed it into himself.

"What the hell is he doing?!" She thought.
