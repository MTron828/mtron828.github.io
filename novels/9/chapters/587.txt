Chapter 588 The lone worker

Out somewhere in an unknown area, in uncharted territory, a top of the line spaceship could be seen floating in place. One would think there would be a top-level highly coordinated crew on board but left to protect the large ship that could house around two thousand or so soldiers, was a single man.

Or a single young adult, called Peter. It had been a while now since the others had left him to take care of the ship and he could safely say there were no problems. At least with the ship itself, for there was one large problem with himself. It was the fact that he was bored.

There were a few reasons why Peter had been selected as the perfect candidate. The main ones being that he never needed to sleep. If there was ever an enemy coming at any time of the day, he would be able to tell.

His ability to absorb and repay knowledge quickly was another point. Everything when Logan needed to tell him about the control‚Äôs of the ship. It had sunken in and only needed to be said once.

He had received no contact in the ship from any of his team-mates. That included Quinn, but he wasn‚Äôt too worried. At one point, Peter could feel himself getting stronger, which meant Quinn was getting stronger as well.

However, there was one thing that Peter could do to pass the time while on the ship, and that was playing the VR game, power fighters. There was a gaming room onboard the ship that had a few VR capsules for them to play in. At first, Peter had steered away from playing the game taking his duty seriously.

But during his time in the ship, he didn‚Äôt see anything happening. Not a single interesting thing had occurred. It turns out space was pretty boring once you got past all the pretty sights. Especially the part they were in right now.

The large ship was partly still in the Milky Way solar system and they far out from the path that one would have to go to head to the warp stations. The warpstaions was practically a large teleporter that the humans used to move their ships. There were four in total spread far apart from each other, each owned by the big family and the military and Truedream sharing one of them.

This was because the beast planets weren‚Äôt located in the same solar system as the one on earth. Although the warp station was no longer heavily manned or controlled by the military or families like it used to be, just like the earth stations. Such a large and powerful looking ship would have brought them a lot of attention, which was why they had chosen to use the smaller ships to arrive at the Crow‚Äôs base.

So the area, the large ship and Peter were in, was a dead space located in the Graylash family area but there were no planets nearby, or anything. In the end, he gave in to his temptation and started to play the VR game once more. He wasn‚Äôt just planning on playing the game but also improving his skills.

He realised that when he went to the vampire world, he couldn‚Äôt rely on his strength and healing ability. There were plenty of vampires who already had that. The place where he lacked was fighting skill.

But there was no Edward to teach him here, so the only thing he could do was watch the skills people used in the game and try to imitate them.

When looking on, he quickly realised his problem. If he didn‚Äôt have a traveller ID, he would only be able to face opponents ranked from F to D. Still, he would play the game anyway.

His opponents were less than impressive, most of them were slow, and didn‚Äôt really help Peter learn anything. Still, it was the only thing he could do. His one hour soon became two which soon became three, and among the low ranks, he was making a name for himself again.

"ZombieP, he just beats up everyone with his fists, the game says he doesn‚Äôt even have any beast armour attachments, how is he so strong?"

"Strength ability, maybe?"

"Nahh, I‚Äôve seen his username before, when I was at the military, this guy, he can heal really fast, that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs called Zombiep"

A few opponents had injured him and had gotten to witness this, but they still couldn‚Äôt figure out how he was beating people so easily. With each match, he played he would get an invitation asking him to join their faction. He would ignore it and continue to play the game.

This time though, when Peter logged out from the game and headed to the main command centre, he could see one of the screens flashing red.

‚ÄôDamn, did something happen while I was playing the game?‚Äô He rushed over to what looked like a radar screen.

The sensors on the ship had picked up something.

"Display image," Peter said.

The centre section of the glass screen that would usually show the outside space changed showing an image of a small ship that was approaching them.

‚ÄôNow this is a little interesting. Quinn did say if I couldn‚Äôt deal with it then I shouldn‚Äôt, but this should be enough, right?‚Äô

The controller Logan had given him was more like a touch screen tablet, with tabs. Each one, when clicked on and selected, would control a different part of the ship. Searching with his eyes, he finally saw it, the tab for the ship‚Äôs weapons.

Inside the small spaceship, was military personnel. A team of four to be exact. Originally there were two ships that were tailing the larger ship when it had left for earth. At first, they had both left to report, but the commander asked for one of them to stay and keep an eye but to leave immediately if they saw any other ships approach the larger one.

Oscar, the supreme commander, was afraid that the ship now belonged to the Graylashes and the whole thing was a trap if the military tried to get it back.

After watching for a long time, they had seen no one approach it, and only a small ship left towards the Warp station. So much time had passed by, and there was nothing.

In the end, the ship decided to tempt fate. They made the ships, so they knew the raiders range. The soldiers‚Äô hearts were beating fast, and when they finally entered the area, there was no reaction. They briefed a sigh of relief.

They tried making contact with the large ship as the commander asked, but there was no answer or anything. It was all too strange, so they decided to investigate.

Halfway on their way, there was when they realised their mistake. The ship had made its first movements. Out from the bottom, a circle head had come outs and with it for cannons.

Now the ship had been seen, Peter couldn‚Äôt let them get away. The particles surrounded the cannon‚Äôs and the small ship tried to move away, but it was too late.

As the bright white beam left the cannons, the attack was too wide for them to avoid. It had hit the ship destroying most of it, and everything that was inside.

"Error, Error. Please refill the canon with Advanced tier crystals" the Spaceship spoke. Right now, they didn‚Äôt have any advanced tier crystals, the only ones that were on board were bags and bags of the small blue ones. Which were used to maintain the ship. One a week a bag of the crystals had to be dumped into a special area shown by Logan.

Peter started to scratch his head now wondering if blasting them was such a good idea.

It looked like if more trouble was to come, then Peter could no longer use the cannon which would definitely bring them more trouble.

‚ÄôHopefully, the others have returned by then.‚Äô Peter thought.

His routine was once again boring, and he had expected something to happen quite soon after destroying the ships, but still, there was nothing.

When going to the VR room, Peter paused for a second, just fighting these types of people was wasting his time, and last time he had entered the ship nearly suffered an attack.

So before entering, he went back and returned with some beast gear. It was a pair of basic tier Tonfa. A Tonfa was a device similar to a Botton, a blunt object, but there would be a side handle, willing a part of it to be used as a support.

Rather than swing around a baton-like so, it felt more like a natural part of one‚Äôs hands. These were gifts from Logan.

There were many weapons Logan had tired a while ago when he first worked with Peter in the game, and this item was one that had suited him greatly.

If he could get skilful in using these and then make a beast weapon, it would increase his power, just as Peter was about to get in, a message was received on the ship.

The game could wait, for the first time, Peter was going to have human interaction.

"Play message."

"Hey Peter, it‚Äôs Logan. I‚Äôve sorted out what I wanted to sort out on my end, so I‚Äôve started digging into the Bree family. It looks like there may soon be a chance for us all to meet again. Something big is going to happen, and soon." Logan said.
