Chapter 998 - Respect for you

’Oh no!’ That was the first thought that came to Quinn’s head after delivering his kick. He had performed the t.h.i.g.h kick. A move he had practised many times, but everything he had initially planned had gone wrong or different to how he had expected.

For one, Quinn had only planned to use half his strength, hoping to match what he had done in the game. He thought he had the speed and strength down so he could imitate that quite well. However, this was real life and not the game.

For one, Sach was far faster than Quinn had anticipated, so while he was getting prepared, Sach was already upon him. Lifting his leg, if he was to hit him, he would need to move his leg faster, and with that, more strength was added into the snap. The last thing, due to the way Sach ran forward, he had his body bent slightly downward and instead, the kick was meant to be sent to the t.h.i.g.h, which had hit the side of his body.

’The kick was stronger than I thought it would be as well.’

The crowd was cheering just moments ago, expecting to see a tough fight, or some even expected to see a one-sided, but not in the way they had panned out, had gone silent. The result was unexpected, and they weren’t quite sure what happened. They didn’t even see what Quinn had done.

Very few people had seen Quinn move his leg, but what they could see was Sach being held up by Peter, holding him by his armpits like a child who refused to go to bed. His legs weren’t standing firm but were being dragged on the floor.

"This can’t be real! Did General Sach just get beat with one hit!" Innu shouted, not being able to hold in his shock.

"It looks to be that way, and it seems we have underestimated him," Samantha added. "From now on, I think it might be best that we leave him alone. If this wasn’t an official match and we got on the wrong side of him, we could very well end up...." She didn’t continue, but she was shaking inside.

From everything she had seen General Hardy do, she just couldn’t make sense of who he was from the Cursed faction. How could someone so strong, with so many connections, be kept secret from the world.

At one point, she had made a guess as to who exactly this person was. One of her main guesses was Quinn Talen, the leader of the Cursed faction, a person could change their appearance or find a way to if they wanted, but there were many reasons why she thought it couldn’t be him.

Quinn Tallen was a person who had the unique shadow ability, something not seen by others, a mysteriously strong ability, but she had seen Hardy use some form of mind control on that day, and now had also seen him use feats of strength beyond human capability without beast gear.

One of these things had to have been an ability, so it couldn’t have been Quinn. The fact that the Cursed faction had someone this strong on their side was a frightening thing and Samantha was starting to understand why Oscar wanted them so badly on their side.

A few seconds later, Sach was seen moving about.

"What happened?" Sach said.

"Wakey wakey sleepy head, you were just knocked out for a few seconds, that’s all," Peter replied.

Quickly getting away from Peter, Sach noticed a piece of his c.h.e.s.t piece had fallen on the floor, and when he looked to his side, he could see that it had cracked all the way up. He looked at Quinn’s legs which seemed fine, and could only see the gauntlets on his hands.

What had surprised Quinn and Peter was how Sach was walking. He didn’t seem hurt or in pain and was walking towards Quinn like he was fine.

"Stop, I know you are okay Sach, but it was clear that you were knocked out, and Hardy chose not to attack you further," Oscar announced from a special area that was in a glass box shape designed for him in the stadium. "I’m afraid even if you can continue to fight on, I have to give the win to the Cursed house."

Hearing those words, the crowd from the Cursed house section broke their silence as they cheered with joy. They didn’t quite understand what was happening but were just pleased that their House, who they never expected to win, was able to pull the victory. The left side of the stadium was rumbling and shaking with excitement while the others sulked, still confused at just what was going on.

Usually, an attack using half of Quinn’s strength would break some bones. If something was strong enough to destroy emperor tier beast amour, Sach should at least be hurting with each breath he took, but he walked over completely fine.

He stopped about two meters away from Quinn and smiled.

"It seems the two of us got off on the wrong foot. I just want to apologise for what I did." Sach said, still having the biggest grin in the world.

Based on his scary looking appearance, Quinn found it a little creepy, and with the sudden change in attitude, it felt like he was talking to a different person.

"You know, I always knew you were holding back. I just never knew by how much, it’s why I never chose to fight you, but I guess now I know. I’m glad I picked the right person." Sach walked up to Quinn and placed his hand on his shoulder.

Quinn could tell there were no longer any intentions for him to hurt him, so he let it be.

"I hope you can make my dream come true," Sach said, walking off to his side, leaving Quinn standing there in the centre of the arena.

’Why do those words sound so familiar?’ Quinn thought when it had finally hit him.

Those words about making someone’s dreams come true were spoken by the martial arts god.

’Wait! That person is the martial arts god, the green-haired split tongue dude? That can’t be possible!’ Quinn thought, as his mind was blown away. ’But their personality, from when we first met, and the person in the game. They’re like two different people. Even his movements just then.’

’Do you remember what I said to Quinn?’ Said Vincent. ’About how it seemed like the man was roleplaying. In the game, he probably chose to act a certain way, and when people respected him for that, he kept that act and image up. It is the character he has chosen to be.’

There were a few things the others didn’t know about Sach, but he was actually recruited from a recommendation from sergeant Chun after playing with him in the game. Only Oscar knew his skills with the Muay Baron, but he also was able to fight in several different styles, and he had done so in the past against others.

He never chose to display his Muay Baron skills against others. When asked why his answer to Oscar was he didn’t want to kill anyone by accident. It was a martial art meant for killing. Of course, there were some moves that could be used, such as the t.h.i.g.h kick that Quinn had performed, but moves like that could be part of any martial art.

Another fact was he had also been discovered by Logan, who had checked the game logs. When he found out Quinn was training with the martial arts god, he found that it was linked to someone in the military base but didn’t know who.

Now that Quinn had found this out, and how he managed to beat his gaming teacher in the arena with one hit, he wondered what rank he would be in the game if he allowed himself to use his full strength.

"Innu, I won’t be taking part in your schemes anymore. Everything that happened to us that day was deserved by us." Sach said as he went ahead and joined Samantha.

Innu couldn’t understand what was happening. It was as if Sach had been hit by some enlightenment when he had been kicked.

’So what if he’s strong, so what if he has money? There have to be ways to get at him.’ Innu thought.

"I must now call to the end of the event and thank Hardy for a spectacular ending. The winner of today’s event is the Cursed house!" Oscar shouted and looked at Quinn as he had headed back to all the others.

’Quinn, you managed to do that without any beast gear on? How many secrets are you hiding? If we want to win this war against the Dalki, we are going to need your help. "
