Chapter 1251 - Blessing

When Quinn had first seen all the different levels of beast crystals on board the Dalki Mothership, the first thought he had in his mind was that he could use them to evolve both Vorden and Raten.

There weren’t any tier crystals beyond that of the king tier, so there was no need for them to be used as equipment. Besides, there was something better they could get out of it.

A Demon tier beast as an ally was unheard of. Even Mona, who was part of the big four, could only control a Demi-god tier beast. At the same time, it was beneficial for both of them as well. The whole world was currently in a war. In a war like so, people didn’t get to choose if they had to fight or not, they had to fight, and it was best if they had every chance they could at evolving so they could survive.

First up from the two of them was Vorden. He was currently an Emperor tier beast that could use the power of wind and had a fast agile body. As Vorden himself found out, the problem was that Emperor tier beasts were no match for the Dalki they were facing.

At first, Quinn had done a simple test. He had selected an intermediate tier crystal and allowed for Vorden’s body to absorb it. When using the inspect skill Quinn could see that his evolution percentage had gone up by one percent.

Selecting another intermediate tier crystal, Raten was asked to do the same.

"Come on! Wouldn’t it be better to just have me evolve?" Raten complained. "Surely one Demon tier beast would be better than having a legendary tier beast."

It was safe to say that Raten was looking forward to his evolution and what his new body’s powers could bring him. After absorbing the one crystal, Quinn could see that Raten’s evolution had only improved by 0.02 percent.

"You won’t evolve," Quinn said. "Even if we were to give all the crystals to you, you wouldn’t evolve. It looks like it’s going to take a lot to evolve you Raten."

Raten looked disappointed by the answer, but he didn’t think Quinn was lying. He hoped that even Quinn would know they needed a Demon tier beast more than anything after going up against the five spiked Dalki.

After absorbing close to two hundred crystals, Borden’s body was going through the stages of evolution. His body was taking some time to take in the energy inside him. Eventually, a bright white light was shining from his body. The outline of it could be seen slowly changing.

His black fur on his head started to grow even longer, now reaching below his waist, While the hair on his tails would rise up even more. Another strange change was his arms. The fur was coming out more so from it, nearly imitating tiny wings, and if one was to move the flowing hair going along his back, they could see the same.

Finally, the evolution was complete. Vorden was now at the legendary tier level.

"What type of beast are you?" Pai wondered as he got closer to looking at the details. "At first, because of the black fur and your forward like face, I thought you were some type of black wolf beast, but from your arms and small wings on your back. It looks like if you keep evolving, you’re going to like some type of bird beast."

"It’s stupid to try and compare beasts from other planets to the animals we have on earth," Vicky commented, pointing out the obvious.

"I don’t know when I will be able to get our hands on crystals like that again. Especially with the situation as it is." Quinn said. "So maybe this will be the level you are at for a while."

"I can only say thank you, Quinn. I know what the situation is like." Vorden replied.

Since Quinn realised that the reminding crystal wouldn’t evolve Vorden to the next stage again, they decided to use the rest on Raten. If they didn’t, they could just see Raten complaining the whole way.

In the end, after absorbing all of the crystals, Raten was now 60.42 percent on his way to becoming a Demon tier beast.

"You know, speaking of crystals. Hilston had a bunch that he never used, that were all aboard that ship of his." Vicky said. "After he got the Demon tier set, he wouldn’t accept anything less than that. So crystals would hardly be used. Although I’m guessing the ship is either in the hands of the Chained or Mother and father have it by now."

After saying the words mother and father, Vicky bit her tongue. She was trying to get out of the habit of saying those words, but after years of keeping up an act, the habit wouldn’t be broken overnight.

"Quinn, what are you planning for us to do now?" Vorden asked. "I mean, when the Cursed ship is repaired, do you want us to protect the Cursed planets?"

"No," Quinn replied. "I think if we send any strong reinforcements, the Dalki might think we’re prepping something and act out before then. At the moment, Sam is asking for small teams to be sent out to the three Cursed planets we have control of and setting up teleporters. The Dalki don’t know our teleporters are back online, so we can go and help them out whenever we want."

"What are you going to do?" Sil asked.

Quinn held the Demon amulet around his neck and thought back to his defeat in the Dalki body against Graham.

"I’m thinking of going to some of the planets that have been taken over....Alone." Quinn answered. "The Demon tier amulet was made into something special, and I can use its powers to help us out the next time something like this happens again. So tell me then, why did you ask, what do you want to do?"

It was clear there was something on their mind, and Quinn could tell they wanted to ask something.

"Well, we were talking about it, but we wanted to head back to Blade island for a while. There are strong beasts on the island that Raten and I can use to evolve, and we also want to find any hints we can to find the other two Blade members that escaped. At the same time, Vicky and Pai wanted to use it as a base to get back to while they search for the Chained."

At the moment, Eno and Mona were heading towards Balde island to reinforce it. At the same time, Dennis had gone along with them since he too had the shadow powers so Quinn could quickly travel there. He would also set up the teleporters so the world leaders and Quinn could get there at any time possible.

"I’m not going to stop you guys, you guys are strong, and I can tell you your family history is important to you guys," Quinn answered. "But I just want you guys to be cautious. Eno, the demon tier beast, are on that island, and there is a high chance that it’s the next place they will attack, but if they do, I will be there."

Vorden felt a little guilty about not telling Quinn the whole truth, as there was one more reason why he wanted to go there. It was to see if they could find anything on the fact that Hilston was trying to accomplish a Blade with a soul weapon. There had to be a method to his madness and something they might have missed.

This wasn’t something Quinn needed to concern himself with.

"Quinn, if you need any help, you can ask us as well," Sil said with a smile. He seemed to be recovering well after the fight and everything to do with Hilston.

It was a good thing that Vorden and Raten were by his side, and even more of the Blade’s with Vicky and Pai. They were able to just fill the family gap that Quinn couldn’t.

Leaving them be, Quinn had one word to say to them all.

"You guys, make a good family and one hell of a scary one." Quinn smiled, leaving the room.

Using the Demon tier amulet to obtain more Dalki and create higher spiked Dalki was Quinn’s goal. At the same time, he could use their exp to level up. Before he could go off the planet Caladi, he needed to wait for the preparation of the video that was to be made.

It was a broadcast to congratulate the Cursed faction while showing them giving the Demon tier weapon they had found. So before that, he couldn’t leave the base, but there was still one more thing he wanted to do anyway.

Heading to his own training room, Sam had said there was a nice surprise for him when he got there. Entering the pin on the secure door, he was let in, and Quinn could see five different flasks laying there on the ground.

The flasks that were used to hold vampire blood.

’Did he borrow the flasks from the others? I guess I’m going to have to give them back.’

Opening up the lid and using the inspect skill, Quinn could immediately tell all the different types of blood in the flask gathered. Drops from hundreds of people in each of the flasks from all those in the Shelter. From the people, he had never consumed blood from before.

’My Qi right now is stronger than my blood power. It was a problem before, but it can help me suppress the blood addiction more so. So I can take more drops of blood at a time. My control has gotten better, so this shouldn’t be a problem.’

Taking the first flask, Quinn started to drink it and got to work straight away. He could feel the red energy spiralling inside his body, but with how much practice he had done with his Qi, and his blood control having improved. It was almost too easy for him to get rid of the blood addiction.

What was difficult in the past was now simply effortless, and with the stat points gained, Quinn had a massive smile on his face as he figured out something.

’Wait a second, what is this! Why didn’t I think of this before? Maybe the penalty was a blessing in disguise. Perhaps this is a chance for me to correct my stats!’ Quinn thought as he went on to the next flask, and he could feel his body getting stronger by the second.
