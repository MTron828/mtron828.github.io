Chapter 2533 ¬†The Celestial attack

Chris wasted no time getting into action and he was careful with what he had done. He could have easily just slashed the giant ship in half, but if he did, then all of the debris from the ship would have fallen on the settlement below.

It would have destroyed a lot of the houses and perhaps hurt a lot of the people. Which was why Chris had decided to bash the large ship to the side instead. Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

Crash landing in the forest by the side, many of those that were on board were still alive. They were climbing over the large ship, and jumping out from the sides. Now it looked almost as if an army was heading toward the settlement.

They were running ahead at full force, but before they even reached the outside of the settlement. Explosions went off one after the other. Red slashes of aura were swinging down in front of their path and exploding, throwing up dirt and the trees in the air, as well as sending many of the attackers back.

Standing on the wall was Hikel with his aura around him.

"Without my arms it was a little more difficult to control the path of my aura. But if I just have to hit a giant object like that in front of me, at least I can do something." Hikel exclaimed.

"I'm glad you can." Edvard said. "I'll just stay by your side, old friend. Who knows with my luck you might even grow your arms back."

The two of them chuckled at the severe situation, but sometimes, light humour in the dire times was what they needed, and besides they had the rest of the group that could help them out.

Peter had witnessed Russ almost running away, and before he did, Peter grabbed the black sword and ripped it off his side holding it in place.

"Teleport me, teleport me to that other ship!" Peter demanded. "Do it now!"

It was quite painful for Peter to watch the settlement that Quinn cared for getting destroyed like so.

Russ didn't think he was any weaker than Peter, he just thought fighting against him, rather than doing as he asked, would be a bigger hassle. So listening to his demand, he teleported the two of them on board.

They were on the deck of the giant ship among all of the werewolves and others as well. Immediately, several dark shaped mists started to appear from the back of Peter's body.

He threw the sword back over to Russ, and now all four of the familiars were back by his side having reformed.

"Kill everything you see!" Peter shouted as he threw the sword back to Russ.

Peter threw a large fist at a werewolf, knocking it with pure power right off the ship falling to the ground. Two came to attack him but with his head tails it knocked the claws away.

Then with another head tail it wrapped around another demon he hadn't seen before. It was smaller in size, and had horns on its head. It pulled it forward and with a fist it slammed into the demon splattering its body into parts, as chunks of it went off everywhere.

The Boneclaw was teleporting using its large claws to do what damage it could. Genbu jumped in the air, and grew in size, crushing some of the demons. Dunluck, the horse familiar, was running around the area with Ovinnik on its head firing fireballs at everything it could see.

They were doing as Peter asked, and were fighting with everything they had.

Russ was ready to escape, when he felt something hit the top of his head, wetting it completely. Looking up, Russ could see it was from the drool of a Yak.

"I guess I can split some heads of a few giants." Russ said, as fire started to burn in the palm of his hand.

‚Äî‚Äî-

Elsewhere, even the Champions were getting involved, a large bone spear came out piercing several of the Divine beings in the air. Calva's strength was great enough, to the point where if he managed to get a perfect hit right in the head of the Dark beings, that it would kill them in one go.

Pultra was also helping out more so on the ground, as she dashed area to area kicking everything she could see in sight, apart from the ones that looked like Quinn and the others.

The vampires quickly came to the realisation, as they saw them attacking only the demons and the Divine beings, that they were on their side.

Running towards them, Layla fired large Qi arrows at a Golden being, hitting them in the head, the belly, and the arm. It had pinned them down for a moment, and Pultra wasted no time, as she leapt up and slashed it off with her foot.

The two of them smiled at each other but they could waste no time as they had to continue to fight.

"Thank you for helping us!" Layla said, as she pulled out her sword clashing against a werewolf. She stopped several swipes, and then thrust the sword forward. When it pierced the werewolf in the centre, using Qi, she powered her weapon and pulled it up going right through the head.

"It is fine. We must help those that have come to help us. Quinn has done a lot for us, so we should at least protect his world as well." Pultra said, attacking one of the large Yak demons.

"Quinn‚Ä¶ Did you just say Quinn!" Layla shouted. It had been so long since she had heard his name and she was wondering what he had been doing. She had soon recognised the ones' who had come through the portal as Chris and the others, so she was hoping that he had come back as well.

But there was no answer.

The fighting continued, and with the help of Chris and the others, it didn't take long until the second large ship had been destroyed. Nearly all had already been defeated by Peter and Russ on board.

They had jumped off the ship heading to the settlement leaving Chris to do the same trick as he had done before, as he knocked it out of the air, away from the settlement.

The fighting was continuing everywhere, but there were next to no demons that were left. This was mainly due to Chris, who was taking them out one by one, going from area to area dealing with them all in a single swipe.

As they all dealt with the troubles around them, they were all heading to the open area, the large centre market where stalls would be set up. They were searching for Layla and Muka and it didn't take long for them to find her.

Soon, one by one, everyone had entered the centre. As they did they had Divine beings on their tail, and they were in the middle of battle with them all. They continued to fight, and soon they took out nearly everything around them.

"Chris, Peter, Hikel, Edvard, and Sil, all of you, you made it back." Layla said. "But, what about Quinn? Where is he?"

The others didn't answer immediately, it was as if no one wanted to deliver the bad news.

"He's still there, he's still fighting for all of us right now." Sil answered. "The portal closed, but he's still trying‚Ä¶ to get rid of Immortui."

It was what she had feared.

"That idiot, I knew he would do something like this."

There was no time for celebrations though, because although the red portal had been closed and most of the demons had been eliminated from the settlement. They could see several portals opening up, white in colour, all over the place.

"Why are they still after us, this is from the celestials right?" Chris asked.

"I assume that they moved to this world, because of the demons entering, but even though we've gotten rid of the demons,the celestials are still attacking." Hikel said.

"Wait‚Ä¶ if you think about it." Edvard said but stopped himself. They were wondering what he was going to say. "Aren't we all byproducts of Immortui anyway? What if the celestials, these gods that Immortui was trying to wage war against... What if they have decided to get rid of all demons. Because in a way‚Ä¶ we're demons as well."
