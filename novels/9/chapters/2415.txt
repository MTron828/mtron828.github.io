Tenbris screamed in anger and as he did part of his body was slowly changing. Scales were appearing around his skin on the outside and dark blue energy all around the pit was continuing to increase. 

The strong Glutton werewolves from before were being pushed deep into the ground. They were unable to get up even using all of their strength. There were only two standing, Unzoku and the Champion. 

"Tenbris!" Unzoku shouted. "They are already gone. If you continue to ruin this place, then you'll have to face me, you know I'm not afraid of you!"

Swirling energy was now emitting off from Unzoku as well, and the two energies as they were colliding in the air were sparking off from each other. They were creating a type of storm that was even consuming the space where the energies collided at. 

The first to back down from the two of them was Tenbris, pulling his energy away, Unzoku did the same. Tenbris' body also reverted back to normal. In the end, there was no enemy to fight.

"The two of us need to talk for a bit. I think it's best if you set this place back up the way it was from before, and continue your little experiment." Tenbris ordered. 

Agreeing, Unzoku saw the werewolves standing up, as well as the few Chrono that had survived, there were only six of them. The werewolves were looking at them with hungry eyes but the Chrono, even though their lives were on the line, couldn't even lift their hands up. 

"Shinto!" Unzoku shouted. "Clear up the cellar, and get the Chrono back in. Bring in a new group as well. As for the rest of you scram back up until the next night!"

The Chrono had managed to survive another day, and with another group coming,  their chances of surviving for longer had increased, but it also meant that more of their kind were going to die. 

"Wait!' Shinto shouted. "I still have questions about what happened to my brother, what happened to Hinto and the celestials!"

Immediately Unzoku turned to him, glaring at him with his ferocious glowing red eyes. 

"I have told you far more than you deserve for what you have done, now do what I said."

Seeing this interaction, Tenbris was wondering if there were problems between the two. 

Shinto also understood what Unzoku was saying well. Quite easily he could declare that the Champion was a traitor, and then he would have to try to go up against two demon kings at once. 

Against one, maybe he had some small hope of a chance, even if it was less than one percent at winning, but against two, there wasn't even a slither of hope. Because of that, Shinto did as he asked. 

He went to the Chrono first gathering them, telling them to stay behind him, while the werewolves started to crawl back up the pit. 

The two demon kings had changed location. Out of the pit, they were in a large roman inspired hall. The floors were tiled with special stone and there were giant pillars all over the place. 

The ceilings were incredibly tall as if they were made for giants to stay in as well. They had eventually entered a room. It looked like some type of art gallery as there were paintings all over the place, mostly with werewolves.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There was one seat in the back of the room. Made out of chalk coloured stone. Although parts of it were dyed red with blood on it. It was the perfect fit for Unzoku as he sat down on it, while letting Tenbris continue to stand.

"Ha, of course, you would create a place for yourself where you feel like you're king." Tenbris siad. 

"Just get on with why you are here, and leave." Unzoku replied. 

"I already told you, I have orders to stay here by Immortui, so I won't be going anywhere. You see, the situation has changed, I didn't want to say anything in front of the Champion from before but, the demon king Kronker has been killed."

No longer did Unzoku think this was just a small matter, and now he somewhat understood why Immortui might have been dealing with this invader with his own hands. 

The Demon kings all had similar strength, they somewhat knew who was perhaps stronger than them, but because their strength were similar when fighting against each other, they would never go to the death. Because they knew if they did, they might lose a lot more than they gained from the fight. 

Not just that, but there were those other strong races created by Immortui that were ready to take their position at any time. If they won a large battle, then while weakened another demon race could come and take their place.

The current demon kings that had existed hadn't changed in a very, very long time and that was why Unzoku knew that the invader had to be strong.

"The one who did it is named Quinn. He is a vampire that Immortui has been keeping his eye on for a very long time." Tenbris explained. 

"A vampire!" Unzoku said his upper lip had moved up showing all of his sharp teeth.

"Yes, of all things, a vampire." Tenbris smiled. "Based on the situation, there is a chance that if the Champions and the inhabitants find out about this, that they could get the will to fight back again. 

"Although Immortui believes we would have no trouble beating them again. After all this time of building up a strong army, for it to suffer before the big finale, is a big no no, so we need to make sure that they all stay in their place." 

Unzoku understood well. It wasn't the invaders they had to worry about, because they didn't have a strong effect on the local inhabitants, but the champions did.

"Anyway, while we are waiting to hear that Immortui has completed his deal, I will keep an eye on the champion. You have another task that has been given. You are to train up your werewolf army and prepare them. 

"Immortui believes the vampires have long outlived their purpose, and as you can tell they have become a bigger pain in the backside than he first envisioned. You are to go to the other world, and eliminate every vampire."

Memories came flashing into Unzoku's head as he heard this. 

"Yes, we are telling you to complete the task that you once failed before, and you are not to fail this time." Tenbris stated. 

"Wait, how am I even meant to go back to the Golden Space?" Unzoku asked. 

"Well, as you can see, there seems to be more than just one invader. They have somehow found a way in.  So that means there must be a way out of this place. I would start with them. 

"Just remember, you are not to leave a single one alive." Tenbris said.
