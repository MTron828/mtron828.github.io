Chapter Ôªø1888 Universal Bounty

It had been a while since Quinn's last visit, and the Celestial Space hadn't been the same as it was once before. There was an uneasy tension just lying around as those who called themselves gods of the Universe walked around.

There were several reasons for this, and it was mainly due to the fact that things that had never happened before or hadn't happened for a long time were occurring. Thankfully, one of the main causes for concern, BB, hadn't returned to Celestial Space since.

It made others start to wonder if things were starting to turn around for good. However, that was impossible.

"I feel something's about to happen," said Xox, the floating ball Celestial who pretty much only spent his time in Celestial Space.

"You have that tingling feeling in your ball again." Another Celestial laughed while observing one of the many white Spaces.

"This isn't the time to joke!" Xox retorted, "Have you not heard? Mundus gave out words for everyone from Earth. They haven't been making any moves and just been watching, which is what worries me even more."

The energy figure next to Xox started to shiver as he heard the name.

"I thought they weren't going to act until they heard back from Immortui."

"And do you think Immortui will even reply?" Xox replied back.

The Celestial energy said nothing because it was a good point to make. While the two were in the middle of discussing such events, it was at that very moment that every single person had revised a message at the same time.

Xox immediately opened it, and so did the others. Immediately there were whispers and talk about what was about to happen.

[A meeting has been called, and everyone must attend. It begins in 10 minutes, in Area 666.]

In a fraction of a second, Xox could soon see multiple people entering the Space who weren't in it before. It looked like the message was sent out not just to the Celestials in the Space but to the ones who were outside as well.

As for why everyone was complying and listening to such a message, it was because the message came from Mundus himself, the one that was known as the messenger in this place.

Xox and his new friend immediately went to gather in Area 666. It was packed with Celestials from all over the Universe. The Celestials were crowded so close together that it looked like just one blob of light in some places.

Luckily for Xox, he could float, so he rose up above the others to get a clear view, and sure enough, standing on the other side was the messenger Mundus. No one said a word because he wasn't just any messenger but the one who spoke on behalf of the Ancient Ones.

In the Celestial Space, Mundus wasn't a ball of energy like others. Rather, his physical body was present. He was a tall black-skinned figure with a large square mouth with sharp teeth. His head was also long and rectangular in shape. There were four pairs of eyes that went up the large head as well.

As for Mundus's clothing, it was a red robe that dangled over him, covering his entire body and whatever was underneath it.

"Enough of you have gathered now," Mundus spoke, and it echoed in all of their minds at the same time. "This message can be passed on to those that are not here."

Mundus looked out as if he was looking for someone, but the person he was looking for was nowhere to be found.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

"I didn't expect him to come." Mundus said and continued, "We are well aware that there has been a problem, and at first, we were to leave it to Immortui. In the past, he has dealt with the problems that have occurred, and we were sure that he would do the same now.

"To be honest, we do not doubt his powers and believe that he can still deal with the problem if he's given some time. However, whether he likes it or not, the ancient ones have decided that the issue can not grow anymore with those from Earth!"

Xox gulped. This was what he was afraid of, and he knew that their anger would mostly be directed towards BB, and Xox had somewhat helped BB, so he was afraid that he might be targeted as well if they mistook them as friends.

"The number of powerful Gods Slayers from Earth has increased at an unprecedented rate, and there have been no signs of it stopping. We believed that a new Celestial had come into being to make sure the balance was restored, but it turns out the Universe had made a mistake.

"For the one known as BB is fighting with them and against us. BB is strong, and he is growing quite a strong force with him. However, we are sure he will come around, as we all remember what it was like to be a young Celestial.

"However, the ancient ones have asked us to deal with the God Slayers themselves." Mundus lifted his arm, and several images of the God Slayer appeared in front of all of them.

"These are the ones that you should fear. We are not asking you to engage with them, but instead, pass on information to us if you do find them. We will then request our strongest fighting Celestials to take care of them. "

One by one as Mundus called the names of Celestials, and they came out from the crowd proud to be called.

"Zeko, Kipo, Tumoon, Hinto, Weet, and Gorgath. These Celestials have each defeated countless God Slayers and will be asked to do the same again. We ask that everyone aid them in the journey to find and defeat these God Slayers."

Looking at those that had come up to the stage, Mundus realized that Gorgath had never come up.

"Where is Gorgath?" Mundus asked.

"Gorgath is currently fighting against another God Slayer!" A Celestial answered. "I work in his solar system. When he is done, I will pass the message onto him."

Mundus nodded, and with that said and done, the meeting came to an end, and all the Celestials dispersed, leaving Xox to give out a big sigh.

'I guess this is the sign that they want to put Earth back in its place.' Xox thought. 'The ancient ones probably don't want to act due to Immortui. For now, they don't seem to be going after BB either, so I'm safe.'

Floating towards the large images that had been left up, Xox looked at them all, and he recognized one of them, the most famous God Slayer out of them all at the moment.

"This was the one that fought alongside BB. If the two of them are together, then it could be a problem again. If this doesn't work...will the ancient ones finally get involved."

In total, there were eight images of God Slayers on the screen. It was certainly a large number. What was more impressive was the fact that all of the God Slayers had appeared recently.

Usually, it would take years and years for God Slayers to appear, but with everything the human race had been through, they had produced monsters.

The first one that Xox recognized was Sil. As for the rest, he didn't know, but Bliss, who had also joined the meeting quite late, was looking at the images well.

"So they have finally targeted them."

After Sil, there was the image of Chris, then Zero. It was impressive to see Zero up there, but Bliss knew that it would happen sooner or later. After that, there was Erin, then Russ, a recent ally she had been working with, who she had to warn.

On top of that, there was an old friend's image on there as well, Ray. Besides them, there were two more that Bliss had recognized but was surprised to see they had reached God Slayer level, especially since she had thought one of them was dead.
