Chapter 1207 Scarier than a Dalki

Currently, Iree was trying her best to approach the control panel. However, a large obstacle stood in her way in the form of a two spiked Dalki. Her blood spear was drawn and her hands gripped around it tightly, while the small cut she had made on the palm of her hand continued to supply it with great power.

'I might have stood a chance against a one spike Dalki on my own, but a two spiked one might be out of my league, even with this awesome spear's power.'

However, there was one thing for sure, she couldn't afford to turn her back on an enemy like this. Iree was carefully watching the Dalki's movements. It was smiling and creeping towards her. It used its large tongue to lick around its mouth, taking pleasure in the fear it was creating.

The mask that had been handed to Iree started to vibrate. Receiving an incoming call again. She couldn't answer, for one slip in concentration, and it could be the end for her, and that's exactly what the Dalki had been waiting for, leaping forward.

Expecting such an attack, Iree thrust her spear right at the Dalki, piercing through its hand. The second the blade came into contact with the green blood, it started to grow stronger with power and slid in further, but even then, the Dalki upheld its creepy smile, not caring for its hand.

Shortening the distance, the Dalki was now within reach of Iree. Its fist came down aiming right at her head. If she tried to yank out the spear, she would be hit, but letting go of it would mean she would lose the only weapon that could realistically do anything against her foe.

'If that hits me, then I'm dead!' Iree realised as she could see her life flashing before her eyes.

However, just before the fist connected, a flicker of Shadow appeared between the two, blocking the hit. The Dalki was just as surprised as the young woman was, but she was the first to recover from their stupor. Using this to her advantage, she pulled the spear out with all her might and started to retreat back towards the console of controls.

'That shadow, it had to be Quinn, right?'

She and the Dalki were wondering where the Shadow had come from. looking around the room, they could see a young human male was in the middle of transforming.

'What‚Ä¶.is that?' Iree thought. 'He‚Ä¶looks‚Ä¶like a monster! Is that‚Ä¶ a real V?!'

Quinn had yet to turn fully into the Bloodsucker. In the middle of his transformation, he had seen Iree in trouble. When she had decided to come along with him, he had also used the Shadow On skill on her.

Initially, Quinn had wanted to preserve as many MC cells as he could, but after seeing the number of spikes the Dalki had, he had changed plans. There was no longer any need. While in his Bloodsucker form, he would be unable to use his Shadow or blood skills anyway, so the least he could do was help Iree out as much as possible.

However, now the transformation was complete. His hair had fallen to the ground, his muscles were bulging, showing next to no fat on his skin, and his fangs were sharpened. In the Bloodsucker form, he nearly reached the height of his Dalki opponent.

Instantly, Quinn dashed forward at speed quicker than he did so before and went right up to the Dalki's side. Soon he swung out his leg, his thigh and calf veins bulging to support the great strength.

'All my base stats are doubled, but I can't afford to take a single hit from that four spiked Dalki. I'm not as fast as with the armour's active skill, but I can't just pick away at this one.'

'If I hurt the Dalki, it will only allow it to get stronger and stronger as time goes on. I need to finish this fight as soon as possible, preferably instantly. I've practised the thigh kicks time and time again, but I haven't performed it once since I was in this Bloodsucker form, so let's just see how much damage this can do!'

The Dalki, instead of trying to dodge the attack, which he wasn't even sure he could do, decided to throw out a punch of his own, aiming for Quinn's head. The Dalki could tell that this opponent's form was strong, but as a four spiked Dalki he had next to no fear. Having recently evolved into a four spike, he felt almost invisible against anyone but his leaders.

"I will kill you!" The Dalki shouted, throwing its fist out harder and nearly just as fast, but due to Quinn's speed, his attack was able to hit first.

The second it had made an impact, a sound was heard In the Dalki's body. Something it had never experienced before, making his eyes open wide. His fist was slightly off target, falling to the side, skimming past Quinn's face.

At the same time, the Dalki's bone had pierced through his thigh skin, drawing an immense amount of blood.

'I can't fall! Not like this!' The Dalki pushed through the pain. The new rise in energy was making him practically feel nothing anyway, and he could see the Bloodsucker's fist coming at him. The Dalki grabbed the hand by the wrist.

'Shit, I never thought he could remain standing! Two hits should have been enough to finish it, but a four spike can already contest me in a battle of strength?!' Quinn thought as he saw the Dalki fist about to hit his face.

Quickly, Quinn had grabbed the other hand, and now the two of them were holding each other's hands up by their heads, pushing and pulling. Quinn still had his legs, but the distance between the two of them was too great. If he tried to reach with his kick, there was a chance the Dalki could overpower him even in this form.

"Maybe you never fought against a four spiked Dalki before, but a wound like this will soon heal, but I still get the energy boost from the fight. This is how the Dalki gets stronger. Their bodies break down from the fighting and heal, making them even stronger than before. Maybe fighting you will allow me to become a five spike!"

Now thinking about it, it was the same with Borden. At first, he could only summon a few spikes, but the number of spikes on his back would grow through fights and accumulated injuries.

'Doesn't this mean that they can keep getting stronger?' Quinn thought.

Trying to think of the best course of action, Quinn wondered if he should transform back and try to defeat him using other methods. It was then that another message had come up from the system screen.

[2/10 Planets have been taken over by the Dalki]

Seeing this, Quinn didn't have time to mess up. Using all his strength, he pulled the Dalki forward, and with his sharp teeth, he opened his mouth wide, biting down into the neck of his enemy. The green blood soon went through Quinn's body, empowering him more than he had ever experienced before

[4 spiked Dalki blood has been consumed]

[40% power boost has been temporarily applied]

With this, Quinn could easily hold the four spiked Dalki with his arms, then let go. He placed his far leg back and swung it once again with all his strength of a Bloodsucker and power boost. The second the kick connected with the Dalki's head, it flew off from its body and slammed right into the console, destroying one of the control terminals.

The two spiked Dalki, was still engaged in combat with Iree, but when it saw the head of its leader on the console, it froze for a second. Iree, who had been doing her best to survive until this moment, decided to use this moment.

"We are going to win this war!" She shouted, thrusting the blood blade right through Dalki's chest, piercing its heart.

'I Did it, I managed to kill a two spiked Dalki.' She thought to herself, but when looking up, she could see its head had been removed from its body as well. Now Iree was left seeing the most frightening figure she had ever seen. Something that she could have only dreamt up in her worst nightmares.

Quinn, still in the Bloodsucker form, had green blood spatters around his face. His mouth was open wide, baring his fangs.

She took a step back, almost stumbling to the floor.

'This‚Ä¶..'

Soon, his body started to revert back to its original size, his hair started to grow back to what it once was.

"Did you manage to contact Logan?" Was Quinn's words as the transformation had ended.

It took a while for Iree to answer because she was having a hard time grasping what had just happened, and she had expected for Quinn to lunge at her at any moment next. DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

"Um‚Ä¶no, but I think I might have missed a call from them."

It was then that Iree had gotten an update from Yag and the others about some interesting things. It looked like they didn't need to call Logan after all. Besides, even after they had tried, he was unable to answer on his end.

Quinn quickly headed to the engine room, where the Dalki that were guarding were soon dealt with. The engines were easily destroyed by Quinn and the ship started to fall to the ground right on course to hit the other Dalki.

It was at that moment that Quinn had received another notification from the system.

[1/10 Dalki Motherships destroyed]

"Quinn, before we get off this ship, we should head to a place not too far away from you. I'm sure we can use them somehow!" Yag said.

As the group headed over, Quinn wondered if he could defeat ten ships in time because he was currently lagging behind. They were moving fast through the ship as they knew they didn't have much time until it would crash into the ground.

During that time, Quinn's masks started to vibrate once more.

'Is Logan getting back to me, or maybe Sam tried to call me again.' Quinn thought. He had tried to call them back, but there were no answers either. At least he could tell Sam was still alive.

"Quinn! It's Alex. It's done! Your Demon tier item is ready!!"
