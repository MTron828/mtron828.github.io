Chapter 1162 Slight hiccup

Deep in the underground tunnels, Longblade and the remainder of the Cursed group, apart from Quinn, were hurrying as they made their way to the unique transportation vehicle. They were planning to take it to arrive at Area C, where the bait for the Demi-god tier beast has been placed.

"Hey, your friend back there, is he going to be okay?" Rafer asked.

Layla looked back to check if Quinn would catch up to them, but there was no sign of him at all. Shiro wasn’t much in use in combat and Sil would naturally want to go after the humanoid beast, so was she supposed to fight off Pure on her own?

Layla had succeeded against Agent 11, but there was a huge difference in fighting abilities between a double digit Agent and one in the single digits. The girl wasn’t conceited enough to not have realised that she had barely come out as the victor in their match. Luck alone wouldn’t be enough to defeat Agent 2.

"He will be okay." Layla answered. "I’m more worried about myself." She mumbled, but soon she realised that she found herself relying on Quinn once again. After insisting that she could do things on her own, now here she was hoping that he had stayed with them. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

’I really can’t seem to make up my mind, can I?’ Layla shook her head.

Longblade had no idea what Quinn had in mind by staying behind. The quickest way to travel was via the vehicles, but judging by him asking about the tunnels that led to the very place they were going to. He could only guess he was planning to travel on foot, but would he be able to find them since this would be the first time in these tunnels for him.

’There’s no humanly way possible he can reach the area before us.’ Longblade thought as he smiled. ’But he isn’t exactly human, now is he?’

They eventually arrived at the station and quickly entered the vehicle. Everything had already been prepared for them by those guarding the vehicle. The next second, they started moving, travelling so fast through the tunnels that they could hardly see anything.

Finally, the vehicle stopped, allowing them to get off. They ended up in an area that looked almost identical to the one they had just come from. The shapes of the tunnels were slightly different, but it was hardly noticeable, especially for those unaccustomed to this.

However, the soldiers who were protecting the station were nervous as they stood there guarding the place. Afraid that the beast could come for them at any second.

"Has the beast ever attacked the stations?" Shiro asked, looking at how nervous the guards were as they walked through the tunnels quickly but cautiously.

"So far it hasn’t." Longblade answered. "It seems to be scared. We thought that it might attempt to head to the surface. Perhaps attack the Shelter, but it has remained down here, doing its own thing, binding its time."

Although Longblade didn’t mention it, he did have an idea of what the beast was trying to do. Perhaps it was waiting and gathering crystals down below where beasts were plentiful in the hopes to evolve. Then when it was a Demon tier with great power, it would come back with a vengeance.

Eventually, they could see the tunnel opening up ahead, and this was where the apparent beasts would be. If the beast was in the middle of fighting the others, then they could take advantage of the situation. Still, at the same time, they would have to be careful that the other beasts didn’t turn and try to attack them.

When Longblade and the others entered, the first thing they did was check the area. They all stopped for a second at the entrance as they didn’t quite know what to do, until Longblade had given them an order.

"Check to see if anything is still alive and moving!"

Hearing these words, they all started to move, fanning out into two groups. Because of the current situation, Sil had decided to come along with Layla, something she very much appreciated. The scene before their eyes appeared to have come from a nightmare.

The room was filled with dead beasts. More than twenty beasts of various tiers that the military had sent down, yet not a single one of them was moving.

"The beast could be hiding inside here still, so everyone be careful!" Joy warned as they poked and prodded the beasts. What they did notice was that all of the beasts had a hole in one particular area. Only the higher-tier beasts had more than one wound.

"All of them...they all have their beast crystal taken out." Shiro said.

This fact was overheard by Longblade and the others, and they all looked at each other smiling. It meant that their plan had worked, and they had created a perfect opportunity to capture the beast. From their research, the beast should be using it as fuel to evolve, making it enter a weakened state.

At that moment, Longblade pressed his hand against his ear, as he got a report.

"Alright everyone, we need to move out again!" Longblade informed them. "The beast has been spotted in Area A. Avion and his team of Combat Mechs are there. They should be able to hold it there long enough for us to arrive. It will be the perfect time to strike. Due to how far it is from here, we should reach there before Pure does as well. Most likely, they will have been heading in this direction."

Informing them of this, the group was on the move once again, but that’s what had worried the others. Shiro, Sil and Layla were all looking for any signs of Quinn. They had an idea of what he was trying to attempt. With his speed, he was going to try and outrun the vehicle to get here before anyone else, yet he wasn’t here.

Now with the location changing it would make things more complicated.

Layla put on her mask, intending to inform him, but when she tried to connect, there was no answer on his end.

———

A short while ago, Quinn had activated his armour’s special set skill, the Nitro Accelerator that increased his speed significantly. Using this, he ran through the tunnels, and everything became a blur.

Things weren’t as confusing as he thought they would be since there was only one direction he could head in.

’I guess this isn’t the time to hide exactly who I am.’ Quinn thought as he used shadow equip while running. His hands were now also covered in the two new gauntlets he had obtained. The main goal was to defeat the Demi-god tier beast as quickly as possible.

’With the white gauntlet, I can hopefully drain its energy just enough so we can capture it.’

Quinn had a plan, but there was a slight hiccup. While travelling, Quinn heard the sound of voices ahead of him, and he was heading right on course for a collision into a group of men. He had no choice but to slow down, but it was hard at the speed he was travelling. The Vampire Lord couldn’t instantly stop the muscles in his legs, as he still wasn’t used to running this fast.

"What’s that sound?" Someone asked. It sounded like a drill going off in the tunnel, but it was just the sound of Quinn’s feet hitting the ground at great speed.

Stepping in front of his men, the man with a large number two on his back held out his hand for a few seconds. Then for a split second, they could see what had come around the corner. Seeing the group of people, Quinn leapt up into the air to try and avoid them and felt his body slam against something that felt like an invisible war.

Agent 2’s face squinted as he quickly took down what he had put up, and Quinn was seen skidding across the floor. He soon got up and could see the large number 2 on the person’s back.

"Pure!" Quinn shouted out.
