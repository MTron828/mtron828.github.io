Chapter 1154 Bucky a legend?

Before entering the VR capsule both parties had been told the official rules by the organisers and both had agreed to them. They were allowed to wear whatever beast equipment they wished. The only beast weapon they were to use had to be a blade of some type.

Both of the blades that would be used would be of the same tier level. Since it was VR, Quinn was able to select a suitable weapon for himself but just chose to go for a standard longsword.

However, the rules had never mentioned anything about abilities and this was because Longblade had one that would give him a huge advantage in this type of match. Since his skills with a sword were usually enough to win over his enemy he didn’t really abuse it, but this fight was one he just had to win.

’Did that Logan Green do something to increase his avatar’s speed output? Tamper with his strength? At least it doesn’t seem like I am suffering from anything like Avion. I didn’t want to do this, but I need to even the playing field somehow.’ ’Longblade reasoned as he activated his ability.

His eyes started to glow slightly and pupils’ outline became blue. A sign his ability was activated and now he could see it. It was strange when Longblade first used the ability playing the game he thought it wouldn’t work, but it had something to do with seeing the opponent in front of him that allowed it to.

’Now let’s see, what exactly you plan to do.’

Around this time, Logan and Layla returned, only there was a suspicious large box shaped like a coffin on the boy’s back. Making it stand out even more was the fact it was easily twice Logan’s height. It looked quite heavy, but ultimately the ones doing the heavy lifting were the additional robotic arms. When they finally met up with Fex and the others, Logan put the box down upright by the group’s side.

"Finally, you guys returned. What exactly happened?" Fex asked as he turned around to see the strange appearance. "What the hell is in the box?"

"A person." Logan stated without blinking an eye. "We don’t want this one to escape so we had to restrain him. Don’t worry, he’s still alive and has enough air to last for a while. I just thought this would be the best appearance to cover it up. It should deter others from opening it, as they might think there a V is inside."

Fex wanted to say something, but judging by how extremely extremely tired Layla looked, the cuts on her arm that were healing slowly, ,while part of her body was badly bruised he understood that it couldn’t have been an easy fight.

On the other hand, Logan looked completely fine, no wounds whatsoever on him. At least from what they could see on the outside. It made the vampire question if he had actually provided backup or had just let the girl do all the work.

Logan had been able to stop most attacks with his giant Dalki arm, but there was something he had realised during the fight. Although the Pure members that had fled didn’t seem too powerful, they were able to use Qi. They hadn’t been too proficient with it, either that or they had a low reserve of Qi, but it had been enough for Logan to still receive a cut on his arm.

When he was cut and blood was drawn he noticed the colour was green and something strange happened. An energy had entered his body, and he had felt himself becoming angrier. Because of this, he had ended up fighting more cautiously after and it was also the real reason he didn’t want to chase after those that had runaway.

’I guess I might need to run a few tests on myself. Otherwise I could become a liability to the whole group. In Borden’s case he stated he felt an energy rising in him whenever he was injured and his anger was always directed towards those that hurt him and not the others around him.’ Logan thought.

He wasn’t too worried right now, but it was always better to be safe than sorry.

———

Back in the arena now that Longblade had been sent across the field, Quinn had time to look at the others and there he could see that Layla and Logan had returned. It was a relief for him, that he didn’t have to go on some grand journey to save them once again.

He had done that often enough already. Now that he knew they were safe, he could relax and have some fun just as he had intended in the first place. Quinn gripped the sword and waited for Longblade to make his next move, but for some reason he hadn’t moved at all.

Instead his face was twitching as if he was angered by something, something that he didn’t quite understand.

’This doesn’t make sense. With my ability I can see the outcome of the next five seconds based on my movements. So why? Why is the future telling me that no matter where I attack, that I will be the one getting hurt no matter what I do?’ Longblade was getting frustrated.

His own ability was simply telling him that no matter what he was going to do next, this Bucky guy who he had first heard of today would be able to react and counter him. However, there was one ray of hope, as Longblade found a way through.

He charged in like before, unfearful and more confident because his ability told him that this would work. Seeing this, Quinn thought it was the same set of moves as last time, but he could tell something was up.

’I might need to use my full strength and speed for this one. I was hoping to win with a clean score.’ Quinn smiled to himself. This was what he wanted, to see a swordsman at work, one that showed everything they had.

When Longblade finally reached Quinn, he swung his sword once again striking from down below. Seeing this Quinn went to block as he always had just moving his sword in the right place.

’I’ll strike after this block and keep doing so, ending this match.’ Quinn thought.

But then something strange had happened, as the sword was in the right place to block his opponent. It seemingly phased right through the Colonel’s sword, disappearing and then reappearing like Quinn’s sword was never there. It sped up significantly and a clean strike was made right through Quinn’s head cutting through from the chin.

A large pain went through him, but the gaming system allowed him to recover quickly and he jumped a few steps back. Looking at the scoreboard it counted it as a lethal blow meaning Quinn had taken ten points of damage.

"Whoa! That’s Colonel Longblade for you! The best swordsman in the world."

"I was getting worried for a second when his opponent was blocking all the attacks."

Quinn stood there for a few seconds in disbelief. He had been taking it easy so far, but just now he had used everything he had in an attempt to block the sword and at that moment, he had no clue what happened.

Of course, if Quinn was using his beast gear, blood powers and shadow powers it might have been different. Then Colonel Longblade wouldn’t have been a match for him but it was still apparent that if the two were fighting sword to sword, Quinn would have lost his life. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Not wanting to waste any time, Longblade decided that he would go for the same move again. After all, it was the only one that his ability told him would work.

’It’s not really the way I wanted to win, but as the Green kid said, a win is a win!’ He thought.

Then for the first time, Quinn entered into a stance. He bent down his knees slightly and placed his sword into his scabbard. He made sure his fingers firmly gripped his sword waiting for the right moment.

’A stance? But that stance doesn’t match the sword.’ Longblade was unsure whether Bucky was doing something crazy or was just an amateur who attempted something he didn’t understand wouldn’t work.

Erring on the side of caution, Longblade activated his ability once again and he could see it. The next move was beautiful, it was fast and would slice him in half. Regardless, Longblade had already started the first steps for the phantom blade strike, the only thing he could do was try to cancel it mid strike in order to survive.

When Quinn could see his foot was in range, unleashing his hand as fast as he could, he attempted a quick draw slash.

’I don’t know if this will work, because all I’m doing is imitating what Leo did at one point!’ Quinn thought as he pulled out his blade.

Seeing this, it was exactly a repeat of what Longblade’s ability had shown him. The Colonel cancelled the attack and tried to move out of the way. It looked successful until he felt a sharp pain hit him in his right thigh.

If this wasn’t a game his leg would have been chopped right off.

At that moment five points of HP had been lost from Longblade and the two of them were now at 90 HP points each.

The match was intense, and after seeing that move the crowd thought differently about Quinn. A young man had just pulled off an impressive move. Who would be the winner now? No one knew.

’That move, where have I seen it before?" Longblade thought.

A few seconds later and a notification screen appeared in front of them both.

[The match has been forcefully cancelled]

"Sir, I apologise for interrupting your match, but an urgent report just came in. The Demi-god tier has been spotted!"
