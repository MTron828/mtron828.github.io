Chapter 2482 Keeping a Secret

Opening his eyes, the first thing Quinn was able to see was a long-headed figure staring at him with large eyes. It was clear as day they weren't human, and the last thing he could remember when he was in the outside world was being captured by Immortui.

Taking a quick look around, he seemed to be in a cave of sorts, and Immortui himself didn't appear to be there.

"A chance!" Quinn stated. He lifted up from his seat and grabbed Pultra right by the neck. He then pushed off from the table-like structure that he had been lying on and grabbed straight around Pultra's neck.

He pushed her until her back banged against the wall, and suddenly Quinn's back, there were several blood swords that hovered in a circle, all pointed toward her.

"Quinn, wait!" Anon shouted. "She's on our side, she's here to help."

The voice was recognizable, but just in case, Quinn pushed all of the red blood swords forward, so they were pressing against her skin, and turned around. That's when he could see the familiar Skully, the one that he had helped and saved that was in his shadow.

Pultra stayed absolutely still, worried that if she made any type of movement, it was quite possible that she could lose her life.

'What happened, how did he move so fast? I couldn't even attack back,' Pultra thought. 'And these swords he created, it only took a moment, and each one of them is filled with strong energy. It feels similar to the demon energy, but one thing is clear... he is certainly strong.'

After the Skullys had pleaded with them, Calva had approached him as well. "She is one of us," Calva said, pointing toward himself. "A lot has happened during your slumber, but I decided to get help with the task you gave us."

Seeing how there were only so few in the cave, and all three of the Skullys were fine, Quinn had concluded it was most likely that they were telling the truth. Why would Immortui even keep them in a place like this to begin with?

"I'm sorry," Quinn said, as he retracted his blood aura. "After what happened, I was a bit on edge. So what happened? How did you manage to escape and get me away from Immortui?"

The three looked at each other for a moment and started to recollect something they had talked about before Quinn's waking up. It was whether or not they told him the truth or not.

For one, the Champions were unsure if Quinn was strong enough to defeat Immortui. So one of the things they wanted to do was to train Quinn. With all of their strength and battles having faced him, they would put him through the harshest training they could think of to give him the best chance of beating Immortui.

The conversation had actually occurred while Sil and the others were still there as well, and they understood their sentiments well, especially after explaining what had happened in their battles. T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

However, they had informed them that if it was the case, that Quinn would never agree to it if he knew what the others were doing. If he found out about the fact that the others were going up against the Demon Kings, or Sil against Immortui, then he would try to be there in a heartbeat.

If they truly thought that training Quinn gave them the best chance of beating Immortui, it was best they keep it from him that they had arrived in this world. At the moment, he had no clue the others were there.

Not only that, but if he was to join the fight, there was no doubt that Immortui would turn up like he had done at the last one.

"It was thanks to Shinto," Calva said. "Immortui had trapped you in his base, and Shinto, another one of the Champions, had been placed as the guard. When I found this out, I managed to convince him to change sides and bring him over to us.

"Honestly, Quinn, the task that you gave me was a hard one, which is why I went on searching for the other Champions, and now that the three of us are here, we can help you."

The story sounded plausible, so Quinn didn't think anything of it. If anything, if they had told him his friends were here, he would find it harder to believe.

"So, do you know where the Demon Kings are, so we can get their blood?" Quinn asked.

He was getting straight to the point, which the others were surprised about. After everything he had been through, he wanted to get up and get back to fighting. According to Pultra, she thought that they might even need to convince Quinn to try and fight against Immortui again.

"Quinn, about that," Calva said. "The truth is, we wish to train you. Each one of us has fought against Immortui in the past. We believe with our help, you could learn a lot from us if you face him again.

"Not only that, but the training will allow you the time you need to still recover and the strength to even go against the Demon Kings to get their blood. We have been working hard, and there are those on our side that are helping. We even managed to get you the blood of a Demon General."

Looking at his system, Quinn could see that the quest had been updated. [3/5 General Demons blood]

It proved that what they had said was no lie, and while checking out his system, he noticed something else as well. Quinn's armour, it still was broken and had yet to heal. On top of that, his demon form hadn't come back yet either.

'Without my God Slayer armour and the demon form, will I even be strong enough to fight the Demon Kings, never mind Immortui? Maybe training with those that have faced him isn't such a bad idea while I wait for these two things to recover.'

It felt a bit strange putting these strangers he had hardly met in a position like so, to help him out, but meeting the Skullys, Quinn understood their position well because it was quite similar to their own.

And, he didn't want to just sit around and do nothing. That would only make him restless.

"Alright," Quinn said. "I'll do it. I'll take on your training, but it better be worth my time. I won't be holding back, and if I see no point, I won't be wasting my time."

The Champions' plan had seemed to work, and the group was preparing to train Quinn. Meanwhile, he was none the wiser about his teammates who had arrived to help him, each one of them being in a tough battle with their lives on the line.
