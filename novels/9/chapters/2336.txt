Chapter 2337 ¬†Not A Vampire

With the large-scale attack coming from Andy, mud and dirt was kicked up from all over the ground, it was shaking and the floor was almost breaking underneath them. He quickly went back, and grabbed onto Jessica while the two of them moved away.

"Your‚Ä¶ your arm‚Ä¶ it's back to normal." Jessica said.

"Yeah, but I'm not sure if it's over yet or not." Andy said looking back.

When they got to a clearer part of land, Andy and Jessica landed back on the ground. He felt a little saddened due to not being able to pull all of the Vampire Corps members out of the area.

He had used his string powers to fling their bodies out of the way, hoping to retrieve them after the fight, but he was unable to get them all, and hoped that his attack hadn't damaged their bodies too much.

As for Andy himself, his body was back to its regular size, at least his giant arm was. As a Colossal Draugr subclass, he could change his whole size just like the Great subclass. He could turn his whole body into a giant form, which provided him more strength and resilience compared to his smaller form.

However, being bigger also meant one was an easier traget. Getting out of the way of large scale attacks and so on was harder. What the Colossal Draugr could do compared to the Great subclass, was to freely change certain body parts, allowing Andy to bring out the great strength when he needed it just like right now in the battle.

The dust started to settle and a pair of red glowing eyes could still be seen burning brightly. Both Jessica and Andy clicked their tongues seeing this because it was a clear sign that he was still alive, although he was no longer in one piece.

"You ungrateful b*stard!" Magnus shouted. His left arm, from his shoulder had been removed from his body. It was a clean cut, and even with his blood aura and help of celestial energy he wasn't able to protect himself from the attack.

With his one good hand, he had somewhat burnt the end with his blood aura. The body was healing over the wound, so he wouldn't die from something like this

"I am an original!" Magnus shouted. "It's because of me, you even exist in the first place. If I ask for you to hand over that girl, if I ask you to take your life, to give me all your possessions, then you should do it!"

Andy held the sword firmly in his hand, ready to go toe to toe with Magnus again, he had already done a lot of damage, so there wasn't much more for him to do.

"Are you crazy, are you my father, are you my mother, you are neither of them, so I have no reason to thank you. You're just a crazy old man!" Andy shouted back.

The marking on Magnus' head started to glow extremely bright, and an orb of power was emitted out from him. It wasn't blood aura, the energy was more weighty. Swinging his sword again, in the same fashion he had done before, Andy was blocking the energy from reaching the two of them.

For a moment, Andy stretched out his hand, outside the zone where his sword was covering him from the energy. His hand was in pain, he could feel the great force of the energy and it wasn't like one he had felt before.

"Stay behind me!" Andy shouted.

12:08

What Andy didn't know was that there was a rise in power behind him as well. As Magnus was Its power was not that of a vampire, and if they were to step out, they could very well be consumed by the energy.

"Stay behind me!" Andy shouted.

What Andy didn't know was that there was a rise in power behind him as well. As Magnus was drawing more power, from a particular individual, Jessica's energy inside her, it was growing to the point where she felt great pain in her chest and head.

'Magnus, what is happening to him right now, what is he doing?'

On the outside of his head, a white solid structure started to form. It was covering the top part of his head, down to the top of his jaw. It looked almost like the outside of a skull. His eyes would normally be seen through this skull.

The clothes and armour on his body were ripping off, leaving only a trace of armour around his neck and hips. His whole body was now on show. REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

His bare skin was moving, as if there were bugs crawling beneath it. The shade of the skin started to get darker as time went by.

Out from his long severed arm, something erupted. It looks like part of a giant centipede as there were multiple segments. At the end, two large claws that made it look like fangs.

The other arm of Magnus exploded turning into the same contraption that had just appeared. Slowly, his feet started to change shape as well, getting bigger and wider.

His whole body grew and it looked like whatever he had turned into had finished, he was now an 8 foot creature that was only seen in nightmares.

"What has he turned into?" Andy said. "That is no vampire that I know of, or have ever seen."

At least, when Laxmus had transformed the somewhat resembles a vampire but here Magnus was nothing like that at all.

With the transformation complete, Andy could feel that the energy was no longer spreading out, with no fear, he ran ahead at full speed, and then when he was close his hand started to grow in size and rather than swinging from above he swung from the side.

Magnus stayed in place and smiled. With the sword coming right at him, he swung his left arm forward and it started to extend at a great speed. The separate segments on his arms started to grow, and in between the parts there was what looked like living flesh.

A strange green liquid was dripping from parts of his hand and floor. It crashed right into the sword, the two sharp things and Andy couldn't believe it, his strength, he couldn't move back it was pushing against his arm.

When Andy looked down, he could feel a stinging sensation in his stomach as well. While Magnus went to stop the attack with one hand with the other, he had extended it out hitting Andy right in the stomach.

"It‚Ä¶ hurts so much!" Andy gritted his teeth, he could feel something being injected into his body, and he was getting weaker by the second.

"Hahah!" Magnus laughed. "All of you have no idea, you have no idea how small you are in this world, or who you are going against. Immortui is our creator, and we vampires are just one of the many creations he has.

"Do you really think we are the strongest of his creations? With his powers he managed to create devastating creatures, similar to what I am now, and with it, he took over the other world. The entire universe in the other plane!

"Can't you tell, Can't you see, a being that is that powerful, when coming over to here will create a new world, and when that happens you need to make sure you are on the right side. All of you, everything you are fighting for, will turn into nothing!"

With the hand that had stopped Andy's blade, it started to retract back before extending again. It flared about in the air, hitting the giant hand from all areas. The two large fangs that were on the end of Magnus' hands were slashing through the skin, and it was taking large chunks of Andy's hand away.

"Stop!" Jessica shouted, as she screamed and ran forward. She pulled out her daggers, adn covered them in all the energy she could, she swung them down deep into Magnus' hand that was embedded into Andy.

When they hit, the extended arm looked to bend inwards doing next to no damage, but the arm retracted back. Next, Jessica was looking at what to do about Andy's other arm, but it had already been sliced to nothing and detached from his body.

Andy at that moment, fell onto both of his knees, he had no clue what was happening, but he could feel something oozing around in his body making him weaker.

In this situation what could she do, Andy was in no state to fight, and if the powerful Andy was unable to defeat Magnus in this new transformed state, there wasn't much she could do either.

Turning around, she could see the cruel smile underneath Magnus' skeleton-like face. She then pulled up her daggers and pointed it right at her neck.

"You want me right‚Ä¶ if you don't leave Andy alone‚Ä¶ if we don't leave right now, then you won't get what you want, I'll kill myself!" Jessica exclaimed.
