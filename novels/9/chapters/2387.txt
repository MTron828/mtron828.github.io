The energy that covered the planet, the energy that seeped in from the land of the dead, would usually continuously move towards those of the living. It was naturally attracted to them to a certain degree and the inhabitants had always been taking in this energy bit by bit. 

For the ones known as the demon kings, as well as Immortui, they were able to control this energy and harness it to be used in a certain way. Almost making their body like a magnet that would attract the energy.

However, the moment Kronker, the Durum demon king, unleashed the powerful energy from within, his body started to transform. The energy was leaking out of his body, and it looked almost as if the energy in the air was frightened, attempting to move away. 

Yet, the demon energy being unleashed was consuming everything within sight and it was growing. 

The air above where the demon king was, it was condensing to a darker red as it was gathering. Those that were living on the other planets could see it from a distance, they could even feel it. 

The energy in the air was feeling different compared to what it was before. The demon king's transformation was one that was affecting the whole world. The other demon kings immediately knew what was going on.

"Kronker had to transform, when was the last time something like that happened?" One of the other demon kings thought. "It makes me wonder, who is he going up against."

As the energy seeped out of Kronker, his body was starting to change. All of the hard crystals that covered his body started to light up, they grew slightly bigger and when they reached a certain point, the crystals started to crack. 

It started from his chest, then they were cracking all over, until eventually they burst, breaking out into a tiny million glitter shards that just fell to the floor. The scene looked almost like a bird that was breaking out of its shell, because what had come out, looked almost like an entirely different being compared to what Kronker was before. 

The odd shape due to his large crystallised back had disappeared. He now was a much more completely muscular being, bigger in size, around 10 metres in height, full of muscle. 

Now that the crystals were no longer covering Kronker's body, his flesh could be seen underneath. A deep dark red in colour making it look almost black, while being lit up by a bright red energy throughout. 

The red energy soaring through Kronker's body was glowing with power, and there was power coming out, surrounding his body, glowing, as if it was unable to be all contained within the body. 

The most significant changes to Kronker were in three distinctive parts, the first was his wide chest. There was no armour or crystals on its body, but the glowing energy seemed to concentrate around his chest. 

It had done so in such a shape and pattern that it almost looked as if there were two eyes around his chest. The next section was his face, his large white sharp teeth could be seen, with his small red eyes glowing. 

The facial features had sharpened and refined edges that poked out like the crystal form before, while just above the eyes were two horns that swirled slightly towards each other. Down the centre of the face, was a small set of spikes, similar to that of the Dalki only on a much smaller scale. From the top of his eyebrow they grew slightly larger as they went down his head towards his back. 

Then there was the back itself that had changed, now having these large flowing tentacle-like structures.

The being as a whole in front of them all, truly fit the name demon. 

"It's over now!" Kronker said, and even his words carried great power within them. Energy was spewing out from his mouth, swirling about. His confident laugh though had come to an abrupt end, as he noticed something strange was happening.

When transforming into their demon form, Kronker and the other demon kings unleash an incredible amount of this demon energy. The energy spreads out far and wide, and that energy had entered Quinn.

As it did, he was unable to stop what was happening to him. His body was taking in the energy, and when it did, something inside him was changing, something inside him felt like it wanted to burst out.

A large thump was felt in his chest, it felt so strong as if it had hit his rib cage. He immediately fell to the floor and took in a large breath. The system messages had appeared at that point, and it didn't take long after that for him to completely forget what had happened afterwards.

Kronker was completely unaware of what was happening at the time, due to his own transformation, but the others had witnessed it, the champion along with the other Skullys. 

Lifting up his head, Quinn screamed, his mouth open wide. His eyes were glowing red. Not a single part of white could be seen coming from his eyes, instead a dark red substance started to leak from the bottom of his eyes. 

It looked like tears of blood, having the same consistency, the colour was completely different, almost the same as his shadow blood. Out straight from his mouth erupted his aura mixed in with his shadow. 

It poured out of his mouth and started to cover his entire body, his mask, as well as the rest of the armour from head to toe. The power had covered Quinn completely making it almost look like a fountain of energy.I think you should take a look at

The energy pouring out from Kronker and the energy that was pouring out from Quinn was bashing against each other, but eventually the fountain of energy had stopped, and a shape was starting to show. 

The energy that was on the floor, started to move towards the figure that was standing there, reaching Quinn in his demon form.

"I was right, he is a demon, he is just like them." Calva said. 

"Is he… but the two of them, they look so different." Anon stated. 

When looking at Kronker, in every sense of the word, he looked like a demon whereas Quinn's form was a stark difference. Although just like Kronker his body had completely changed. 

For one, the main difference was the colour of his skin. It was now completely white in colour. It wasn't pale like most vampires. Instead the skin was almost like a chalk colour. 

As for the size of the demon Quinn, he was the same size as he was before, and had the same shape as that of a human. However, calling him human, that was a long shot. On his back, there were two large wings, seemingly made of hardened blood. 

They spread out relatively wide, and had the shape of feathers, but they were constantly moving, and even now at the very bottom, dropping onto the floor from the wings, was blood. 

Strangely though, when the blood dropped to the floor, it would move, joining back up with the wings. On Quinn's body itself, there was no longer any armour, all of it had disappeared, and instead there was a cloak. 

There was no hood to the cloak, it was pointed at the top, while being open revealing the centre of Quinn's body and skin, showing his well defined body. However, there was something strange about the cloak on the body. 

It was constantly moving, and was a dark purple colour, almost black. The cloak itself almost looked as if it was made out of the shadow, and although it truly did look like a cloak, it almost looked as if it was part of the body. There was nowhere to see a separation from the skin and the body.

This was the same for what was on his legs. His legs were covered by the same dark purple substance, but it was constantly moving and flowing. Although his white pale chest was shadowing, a marking could be seen.

Just like the cloak, there were black markings on his chest looking almost like a tattoo. There was no pattern but it was part of his skin, flowing and moving, running from the sides of his chest and slightly up his neck, until it reached his face. 

The black markings continued on his white pale face mainly concentrated under his eyes. They came across his cheeks, covering the sides of his face, and making his glowing red eyes stand out even more.

Finally, there was a sharp smile on his face, a smile that was so sharp in the corners of his mouth and so sinister, that it tilted his eyes. It was a smile that if anyone could see it, it would be seen in their nightmares for their entire lifetime. 

This was completely different to the last time Quinn had used the demon form. In the past he had tried his best to stay conscious and he had somewhat remembered his body changing in certain parts. His previous transformation was much more like that of a blood sucker, only more vicious, although there were also parts that were the same, such as the white chalk skin on his body.
