Chapter 1130 - Bringing one back

While waiting for a response from the Earthborn group, there was something that Quinn needed to do beforehand anyway. Inside his own personal training room was Logan, Sil, Shiro, Peter, Fex and Layla.

These people were in the room due to their connection with a particular person they were planning to bring back.

’This room looks a lot better than the last time I was in it.’ Quinn thought as he noticed the walls were no longer covered in blood.

Shiro was standing on one side of the training room, with Quinn just behind him. While standing opposite the two of them was Sil. Everyone had gathered because today was the day where they were going to run a little test. A test to see if they could wake up Vorden and Raten, who were inside Sil’s head.

"If it doesn’t work, I won’t blame you," Sil said. This had come as a surprise to everyone. Sil was actually the one trying to comfort someone else for a change. Hanging around with Shiro and making a new friend really did help him out.

’I don’t want Sil to go back to the way he used to be, if we get back Raten and Vorden, only one mind can be present at a time, and maybe Sil will just go back to the way he was before. This is just a test for now, and we will definitely move them later. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"Right, I think I have the hang of it now, but it might take a few tries for it to work. I’ve never done this before." Shiro said. He wasn’t worried about using his powers. It was more that he was concerned about disappointing Sil and everyone around.

"We have analysed that there should be less risk at this point," Logan stated. He was looking at some information on holographic screens that would appear in front of him. A copy of the notes was on display, giving him everything he needed. Placing it in his database to bring up whenever he wished.

"Using this type of skill with his ability only requires you and another user. There is little room for problems to occur. Perhaps the worst thing that could happen is that the two of you switch minds, then we would have another problem on our hands.

"Still, we wouldn’t have lost the ability. Since even if you were to end up in Sil’s body, due to the two of you touching, you would still have the same ability to fix the problem that has occurred. In a way, doing this with Sil due to his ability is probably the safest person one can do it with."

It was clear that Logan’s explanation was meant to calm Shiro down, but it didn’t help one bit. Still, he had practised for this day and placed his hand on top of Sil’s head. Everyone waited silently for a few seconds, and Shiro’s hand started to glow slightly.

"It... didn’t work," Shiro said, looking at Sil’s disappointed face, but Quinn quickly placed his hand on Shiro’s shoulder.

"It didn’t work yet," Quinn said.

They repeated the process over and over again, and Shiro carefully tried to remember how to use the skill. Even Logan would reiterate the words and how the ability user of the past felt when using this skill.

After several tries, it seemed like Shiro had finally gotten somewhere. His body was currently in a dark room, or it was safer to say that his mind was. He had done this several times and had gotten to this step, but before, he couldn’t see anyone. Now he saw something for the first time.

Two glowing lights out there in the Dark space. As he reached out to them, his hand went through it like it was nothing.

’I thought that would work. What should I do?’ Shiro thought.

He was unsure if this would work, but maybe things were complex because several minds were in one. Instead of swapping minds like he had done before. On the outside, he was already using the ability and had to concentrate. Focus on using the body while exploring the black space.

But what if this version of him, the one in the black space, also needed to use the ability. Shiro held out his hand again, touching the bright ball of light. Then his hands started to glow, and he was transported inside of another Dark space.

Only he wasn’t alone, and another could be seen.

"What is this?" The person said as he turned around. Am I dreaming? I’ve been alone in this place for so long, but I’ve never seen anyone before, and I don’t even recognise you?"

The speaking boy looked identical to Sil, only he stood quite confident, tall and had a calm look about him.

’Based on what Sil said about the other two people, this one should be Vorden. He said Raten would start cursing at me the second I entered.’

"My name is Shiro, and I’m part of the Cursed faction. Quinn sent me here to see you. He’s been looking for you for a long time now." Shiro said.

At first, Vorden was taken aback, but then the largest grin possible on his face appeared.

"They’ve been looking for me, and this whole time as well? What good friends." Vorden replied as he wiped his face with the sleeve of his shirt.

"My ability has allowed me to come into here. I think we can bring you back to the way you were before so the three of you can occupy Sil’s mind. Right now, the group is looking for a body to transfer you into, and it looks like he might have found something..."

Shiro explained Quinn’s plan, how he wanted to move him into a humanoid beast. Initially, when Vorden had made his decision, he did so for everyone. Not just Sil, but he wanted to protect them all and knew he wasn’t strong enough to do it.

At the time, he really didn’t know what would happen to him. He was stuck in a black room similar to the one before, only he was alone with no way to see or do anything. In here, he had a lot of time to think, and he missed his friends dearly.

"I can wait a little longer," Vorden said. "I don’t care. Quinn can put me in a regular beast for all I care if it works out. I just want to see everyone again, but I think it would be best to leave me be for now. It sounds like that they might need Sil if they plan to capture this powerful beast alive. Our reunion can wait."

"I promise, I Promised Sil and Quinn I would bring you back, so I will be back!" Shiro shouted.

"Oh, before you go, don’t worry about the other one. If he knows, he will just complain about it and make him even madder. Let it be a nice surprise for when he’s finally free." Vorden said, speaking about Raten.

Finally, leaving the Dark space, Shiro was now in Sil’s Dark space, then he had to leave once more. Opening his eyes, he was finally back in the regular room.

"I did it!" Shiro said with excitement, but his forehead and the side of his head was sweating, sweat dripping onto the floor, and Quinn was right behind him, having caught him. Not even Shiro had noticed he had expanded all of his MC cells and a lot of energy doing such a thing that he had fallen over.

"I spoke to Vorden...both in there." Shiro managed to say before passing out and going into a deep sleep.

Sil had already summoned a wave of tears from his eyes, and he was drenching his shirt sleeve, trying to cover it up.

’It looks like they both are still there, now we just need two more humanoid beasts, and we can get all of them back. Just you wait.’ Quinn thought.

’Two more?’ Vincent replied.

’Don’t you remember what I said before, Vincent? We’re getting you a body as well.’
