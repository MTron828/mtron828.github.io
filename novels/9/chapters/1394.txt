Chapter 1395 - Battle Of Daisy (Part 1)

Nearly the entire cursed faction was watching Bonny's live stream. It was exciting for them. They felt like it was payback for what they had lost and a display of the faction's power. However, for the Cursed faction's main leaders, for those involved in protecting the Daisy faction at the time, watching it was nail biting.

Sam had his jaws clenched as he watched everything play out, and every time they saw people dead on camera, he was reminded of the decision he had to make that day. Yet, the person who was finding it hardest to watch everything was none other than Layla.

She had bitten on her thumb so hard while watching the video clip that it was bleeding slightly. She didn't care though. Each time the camera caught some survivors, Layla was looking for one person in particular, yet so far, they hadn't appeared on the screen.

'Please‚Ä¶please‚Ä¶Helen, you can't have‚Ä¶you can't have died!' Layla thought, thinking back to what had happened that day, the day of the Dalki attack.

‚Äî‚Äî

On the day of the attack on planet Daisy, Helen was standing tall on the Shelter walls staring outward. The original Dalki mothership that was on the planet had been destroyed by Quinn, so when they saw another one appear, alarm bells were ringing in her head.

'They haven't just sent that to intimidate us, and from the reports, it seems like the other groups are going to be under attack as well.'

"Peach, contact the Cursed faction, inform them that the Dalki has made their move, and inform everyone. Tell them to get ready for battle." Helen ordered.

Peach, her sister, knew that the Dalki ship moving was probably a big deal. The Daisy faction was strong, and even when they had been attacked multiple times in the past, the Daisy faction had successfully defended it with the people they currently had.

It was a Shelter that had never suffered from a beast attack, or from another faction attack before. It was one of the reasons why the Daisy faction was so feared. She knew that Helen would have defended the Shelter with all her power and would never call for help from the others unless she felt like it was absolutely necessary.

Not long after, and hundreds of pods could be seen coming from the mothership. It was more than the attack from before, and what was worse, they could hear the sound of rumbling. Almost instantly after landing, they weren't building a type of fortress like they usually would.

Instead, it seemed like all the Dalki were on the attack straight away. Surprisingly, standing outside the Shelter wall were the three sisters, along with a large group of around five thousand fighters.

This was the first force of the Daisy faction. Then on all sides of the walls, there was an additional one thousand members covering each side. Finally, inside the Shelter, there were another five thousand ability users ready to fight. At the same time, the rest of those inside were civilians.

The anti jammers were working, and the teleporters were still online to allow them to escape. The only problem was, there really wasn't anywhere for them to run to. At the moment, the other two Cursed faction planets were also under attack, and the Cursed ship was heading their way.

At the same time, although the Cursed ship was large, there was no way that they could house so many people on board. They were already close to their max capacity.

"If they get inside the Shelter, then hundreds‚Ä¶no thousands of lives will be lost. We need to do what we can to make sure they don't make it inside!" Helen ordered.

The large group of five thousand cheered and quickly split into three groups. Each one led by a sister team, and they spread out slightly, with the centre group being more forward. That's when they could see the hundreds and hundreds of Dalki running towards them.

'These Dalki‚Ä¶they look to have higher spikes than the last lot. I knew my feelings were right.' Helen thought.

Still, this was Daisy's planet, and it was designed for combat using their powers. As soon as the Dalki got within a specific range, several of the plants the Dalki stopped on exploded. Vines had grown from the ground, wrapping around their feet, thorns digging into their body.

Of course, there was also Helen's power, as she had several plants pop out from her seeds, firing at the Dalki getting close. On top of that, she ran in together with the combat team and swung her whip, constantly getting rid of them.

"We were once one of the factions considered to become one of the big four. We are no pushovers!" Helen shouted as she continued to fight Dalki after Dalki. Still, her main focus was trying to help those around her rather than killing the Dalki. Since they were fighting on their specially built terrain, they felt powerful.

There were minimal losses on their side, and the powers and fighters were able to support each other well. Once in a while, groups from the Shelter would come out as support and grab those that were more injured than others. Bringing them back to the Shelter for healing.

Although there were more Dalki than the last attack, it was the same for the Daisy faction, which now had support from the factions of the other planets. The reason why they were so willing to follow and help Helen was because she was out there on the field now.

She didn't stay behind, waiting for the enemy to get weak. No, she was fighting against the Dalki from the beginning, and a leader who led through actions was a very powerful thing to the people.

However, soon, a giant shadow would be cast above the entire Shelter. Something gigantic was coming out from the clouds above, and the second they saw it, Helen hated that her gut feeling was right.

For right now, there was another Dalki mothership, and it had decided to attack right from above. Looking out, Helen wondered if she had made a mistake or noticed the other mother ship moving, but it was still there.

Before they knew it, more pods started to come out from above, landing directly in the Shelter.

‚Äî‚Äî

At the moment, on the cursed faction ship, Sam was taking in the reports that he was getting from multiple areas. He thought he might need to send help to the other factions but decided that helping the Cursed faction was the number one priority.

The reason he hadn't sent help through the teleporters immediately was because he was in the middle of deciding which planet needed more help than the others. He knew every second that passed would mean more lives lost, but this was important as well.

He didn't want another situation similar to before where Sil was unable to help in a fight. After analysing everything, Sam had decided to send groups to their respective planets and knew Daisy was in the most trouble.

"Alright, you three will be one group, head through the teleporters. Save as many people as you can, and show the Dalki that they messed with the wrong faction." Sam said.

The three nodded and stepped through the teleporters, and before they knew it, they had arrived in the Daisy faction.

‚Äî‚Äî

Helen was still struggling with the fight outside, but she knew that she needed to go in and help. Those in the Shelter at the moment were the weakest, but just then, she had received a message.

"Don't worry, I've sent in three of the strongest Cursed faction members to help you," Sam said.

And Sam wasn't lying either. A Dalki was seen, ready to swing and grab one of the civilians fleeing, but before it could, something had whisked right in front of the Dalki and grabbed its hand.

A blonde-haired boy, who gave a tug and ripped the Dalki's arm off with his super strength, this was Sil. There was a martial arts expert not too far away, who was dealing with two Dalki at once. He lifted up his new shield allowing them to hit it, and the next second, they were blasted away. This was Nate.

Then finally, Qi filled arrows were seen moving around, hitting a Dalki in the eye and through its skull. The last person who was there to help was Layla. Knowing that these three were inside the Shelter, Helen believed she could fight outside peacefully.

Until a different coloured pod, a larger black pod with golden trimmings, had landed in the centre of the Shelter.
