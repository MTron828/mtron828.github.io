Chapter 1874 Finishing the job

The data had revealed a big truth, and Logan was left in disbelief. After raiding Agent Four's lab, he had come to know what Pure was attempting to do with the Red Heart.

'This is‚Ä¶with all of Richard's data that I have, this could be possible, but why would they attempt to do such a thing? If people thought what the Red vampires were attempting to do was bad, this was much worse than that.'

"Will you just spill it out already rather than staring into space?" Sil eventually couldn't hold himself back, "You're starting to freak me out a bit."

Logan didn't say anything because he wondered how he could not catch what the Pure was planning to do sooner. In a way, he was kicking himself in the foot and couldn't believe he was working with Pure in an attempt to track the Red Heart down.

What would've happened if Logan did find the Red heart and gave it to Pure? He would have been an accomplice!

"Sil, you haven't been around, so you don't understand," Logan replied. "For one, judging by the data, Pure now has the Red Heart. Second, I thought if the Dhampirs were to get such a thing, they would have attempted to destroy it, but instead, they have given it to Pure...and what they plan to do‚Ä¶"

"Look, does it really matter?" Sil replied. "Right now, we have Quinn fighting out there, not to mention you even have me. And they haven't done anything yet, so there is still time to stop them. So let's deal with the rest of this and get to Quinn without wasting any time!"

In the end, Sil was right. Although, maybe because Sil wasn't involved in the events of Earth for a long time, he didn't really know the worry Logan had. Still, perhaps it was a perspective the latter needed as well because the problems that Earth faced were small compared to the Universal problems out there.

Pressing a few things on his arm, the self-built armour that Logan was wearing started to change slightly. Rather than the usual spiders that Sil was used to seeing, it reformed and turned into something else. It looked like the suit of armour was just extending up his neck and covering his entire face.

In the end, he looked like a superhero wearing a complete suit to hide his identity. A metallic blue over his entire body with a slight solid green where his eyes and mouth would be.

"What is that for?" Sil asked.

"I have to hide," Logan replied. "In the first place, I sent these people to apologize for what was happening. If the people see me and know I was part of the attack, it will cause many problems. We must be careful with what we do. We cannot afford to appear in a bad light when Pure's public image is quite possible at its best."

Sil walked over to Logan and suddenly grabbed the latter's arm.

"Oh, well, you don't have to worry about that because they're not going to see us anyway."

Logan stared at the hold, and without explaining anything, Sil used his Blink ability. The next moment, they disappeared from the lab and reappeared a floor above. Now they were in some type of cleaning area or part of the lab's ventilation.

"Just hold on. I will quickly get us to where we need to be." Sil said with confidence.

"Wait, I understand you're using the teleporting ability, but you don't know the ship's layout. How do you know where we're going?" Logan asked, worried they would suddenly go into the ship engine room or an incinerator.

"I'm listening to the noise, I can hear everything each time we stop, so I have a good guess of where to go. They said that there are three palaces, and we have gotten rid of one, so let's finish this up quickly."

After several jumps through the ship and following the noise of the people running around everywhere, it was actually very easy for Sil to figure out where they needed to go. Eventually, they ended up at the very top deck of the place.

"It sounds like there is something underneath," Sil said. "But I thought I would enjoy the fresh air for a bit and see how Quinn is doing."

Looking out in the distance, Sil couldn't see the two of them, so he imagined they had to have been blasted off quite in the distance. Still, he could sense strong energy far off.

'Chris is a lot stronger than I thought.' Sil thought. 'Is he like me? Has he surpassed what a human can achieve? But how is that possible? How did he do it? Unless he has been absorbing energy from Nest crystals like me, or maybe it's something else?'

Either way, the good news was that he deduced that Quinn was doing okay from a large amount of energy he could sense. Only if the energies started to fade would he have to worry.

"Let's get to work," Sil said. He jumped up and reached a great height in the air, right above the large ship Rein. Then, he started to tail his body, and as he did, flames started to spiral right above. There were some people that were outside on board the deck seeing this.

"What is that? Is it a Phenix?!" Someone shouted while pointing at the incoming flame enveloped Sil.

The flames had certainly made the shape of a giant phoenix in the sky so enormous that they couldn't even see the small human within it.

"Don't hurt the people or destroy the ship, right‚Ä¶this should be okay." Sil thought.

The large flame Phenix started to dive down and head straight to the ship. It was flying down at a fast speed. The next second, he changed his ability, switching to the one he had used before: Blink.

Teleporting through at the last second, Sil and the flames of the phoenix had instantly disappeared and had gone right to the floor below the top one on the deck. Logan, still standing on the top deck, began to feel the entire surface below his feet heating up, and the whole ship shook.

The end of the large ship had tipped slightly into the sea and soon started to balance out. However, as soon as Logan regained his balance, he found Sil standing in front of him again.

"Alright, I didn't destroy the ship. It seems I have quite good control now." Sil commented. "Anyway, let's head to the next place."

"Did you forget something?" Logan asked. "I was meant to get information from each lab. That's why you told me to come with you."

Soul didn't say anything, and sweat trickled down his forehead. He had gotten carried away at that moment.

"It shouldn't affect us too much, right? I destroyed everything in there, so it will be hard for them to use anything. Let's go."

The two of them blinked away, heading for the next place.

The rest of the group, along with Muka, had travelled through the ship. Most of the normal populace has gone into hiding due to the alerts and system warnings. This was good since the group didn't wish to be seen by the general public in the first place either.

A few moments later, they entered the training area where around 1000 or so Pure members were currently present. Not only that, but the high-ranking members from Rank 11 to 20 that were still alive were also standing at the front.

"We had prepared for this." The Rank 11 of the agents declared as he stepped forward. He was a tall figure that looked thin. His face was sunken in, making his head look like that of a human skull. "There was always the possibility that you would come to attack under the disguise of apologizing. We have been preparing for an attack on the Green family. Do you really think that we wouldn't be ready for‚Äî"

A large fist punched agent 11 right in the face and sent him flying through the air before he could even finish his words. Then landing on the ground and standing in front of everyone was Peter.

"Why does everyone one of you have to talk so much? We're in a rush, you bast*ds!"

The large-scale attack started once again, but with the skilled agents that knew Qi, it looked like this was going to be difficult. Or so they thought, as in the middle of their fight, coming out like a lightning bolt and Logan and Sil appeared in front of everyone.

Lightning covered both of Sil's hands and was already shocking the nearby enemy Pure members.

"This is the last place, and then we can go to Quinn," Sil stated.

Although many of those there thought they could win due to their numbers, Agent 18 felt otherwise. Seeing Agent 11 and others being defeated so easily, they needed help.

'Why‚Ä¶why can't I get in contact with Zero? Why hasn't he responded yet when the main base is in a crisis?' Agent 18 wondered.
