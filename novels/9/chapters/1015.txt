Chapter 1016 - The power of green blood

The Shelter was dealing with more trouble than they could handle. It was chaos inside, but most of the citizens had managed to go to the underground emergency locations in the Shelter. They were built in case anything like this did occur.

There was also a teleporter in these locations, but today they did not work, and they just had to hope that the glathrium metal bunkers they were in, would hold. The Shelter just wasn’t that well equipped to deal with this type of attack.

Even though only five black pods had landed in the Shelter, the Dalki that had emerged from them were stronger than they had expected. Two of them were one spiked Dalki. The military personnel, including the Travelers, were fighting against them.

They were slowly damaging the Dalki, but it was only making the situation worse. Thankfully the mechs were able to hold them where they were. The travellers that were assisting weren’t high level and didn’t even have decent beast gear on. This was because it was a green portal planet.

The only beasts that would appear on such a planet were basic and intermediate tier beasts. Attracting beginners and those who wished for a safe life.

However, the situation was a lot worse in another area. For a two spiked Dalki other than the one Fex was dealing with was causing a rampage. The mechs that had come to deal with it had already been destroyed, along with the buildings around it.

Civilians that hadn’t escaped were crushed, and those hiding in their homes had no chance of surviving.

In the centre of the Shelter, standing on top of a tall building on a flat surface, was a man with a grey ponytail.

"The military is doing as expected, but that vampire boy is doing better than I thought. This is quite interesting. Still, a head general and a vampire noble who is a descendant required to take on a single two spike. This was not the hope I was looking for." Eno commented, at that moment, something large landed behind the man. He could feel the vibration of the ground he was on.

Eno turned around and could see another two spiked Dalki standing behind him, staring at him.

"Did you think you could hide up here?" Dalki spoke.

"I should have known," Eno said. "There were five pods, so three of them were two spikes and the other two, two spikes. I underestimated the level of forces that you would send. Three two spiked Dalki will be too much for them, I guess I should attempt to help them out a little bit."

Charging in Enos’ hand was covered entirely in red. It looked like blood hardening but soon shaped itself into a spiral and spun like a drill. The Dalki didn’t know what to do as the movements were far faster than it had expected.

It raised its hands, but the blood drill went through the hard, almost impenetrable skin, and once it went through its arms, it continued to go through its c.h.e.s.t, spinning the blood in all directions and even landing back on Enos’ face.

"There is a great weakness you Dalki have," Eno said. "Your race may be a threat to humans, but you’re no threat to me. Do you know why? Because your blood was meant to empower us."

He placed his b.a.r.e hand on the wound of the Dalki and licked it, allowing the green energy to empower his body. Then jumping up in the air, he punched the Dalki as he went back down, causing the two of them to crash through the building, going down from floor to floor.

However, with the Dalki’s wound being a serious one, he too was getting stronger mid fall. The Dalki grabbed Eno by the legs. Before he landed at the very bottom, he swung his body like a baseball onto the ground.

Now, Enos’ body was unmoving, but his eyes were still alive.

’Maybe me trying to help has just made the job harder since I could not finish the job. It looks like my time is over, but I will report everything I have seen to the others.’

The Dalki, standing up from the ground, roared in anger before stomping on top of Enos’ head, spattering it like a tomato.

———

Over where one of the other two spiked Dalki was battling for its life, Fex had just stabbed the needle into himself. The power from the Dalki was injected into him, but the energy inside him was far more than he expected.

’What is this, what is going on.’ It was almost too much for him to comprehend.

What Fex didn’t realise was his soul weapon already increased his abilities when used with human blood. Putting Dalki blood, he was having not just the effect of his soul weapon but that of the blood as well.

The Dalki wasn’t just going to stand there and decided to throw a punch towards the boy standing in front of him, but his arm had been stopped by red pieces of string. It was coming from the boy, but he was a lot stronger than last time.

Pulling strings with his hand, he was able to pull the arm away, and then punched the Dalki in the c.h.e.s.t. It took a step back, but that wasn’t the only hit, soon after, a flurry of punches came towards the Dalki’s c.h.e.s.t as Fex felt more powerful than he ever did before.

"It’s like I’m super Fex!’ He shouted punch after punch. Now the green liquid was spewing as its hard scales were doing nothing. Fists of green blood were now splurging out.

"No, you can’t injure him slowly like that." Samantha thought, watching. "The Dalki, it’s hard to tell when one is on the verge of death. At this rate, if the Dalki doesn’t die, then it means it will just get stronger until it can match up to that teacher again." Samantha thought.

This was why she had attempted to finish off the Dalki right away, always using her most powerful skill.

What was working was, for now, Fex was completely overpowering the two spiked Dalki with his b.a.r.e hands. Seeing this as an opportunity and not making the same mistake as last time, Samantha was going to help this time. The nine tails of earth grew behind the Dalki, and just when the Dalki could feel his energy rising to make a comeback, the nine tails had pierced it right in the back.

It hadn’t gone through deep enough, but Fex, having seen the tails moments before, put all of his strength into punching faster and harder, hitting the body further into the tailed spikes until eventually, the Dalki stopped moving.

"We did it!" Samantha shouted.

At that moment, Fex’s legs felt like jelly as the powering effects of his soul weapon and Dalki blood were over. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

"Those things are so hard to kill." Fex said, gasping for air. While punching, he didn’t take a breath, afraid that the Dalki would have attacked back if he did.

While the two of them were taking a short break after their victory, the sounds of screams could be heard, rumbling and buildings being destroyed. The fight was far from over, and they had only defeated a single Dalki.

"Can you still fight?" Fex asked.

"I’m completely drained of MC. I will need time to recover." Samantha replied, knowing that their best chances of defeating the rest would be with this strange strong teacher.

"Well, you saw what I could do once I stabbed myself with this needle, so will you let me stab you now, and let me control your body," Fex said

Although she was reluctant at first, she had no choice but to agree. Before leaving, Fex stabbed the dead Dalki with his needle once more, filling it up. The two of them then went to high ground on one of the few uncrushed buildings to have a look at the situation. Although Samantha was looking at where to go next in the Shelter instead, Fex was looking far off into the distance, far further than human eyes could see.

That’s when he spotted that an army of Dalki were heading towards a group of students.

Quinn and the other teachers were staring at the trouble they were facing out in the desert as they could see the Dalki were marching through the sand towards them.

"If the Dalki gets past me, survive, survive long enough for me to come and help you!" Quinn shouted.

"If the Dalki gets past you? What are you talking about?" Innu asked.

In a split second, Quinn had left his position, and he was running straight ahead into the forty-five Dalki. While the students and teacher were to remain where they were.

"That person’s a dead man." Innu could only think.
