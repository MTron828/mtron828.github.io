It was quite clear that the Penswi and Mermerials were taking this matter quite seriously, as they had sent a little over fifty percent of their forces to aid the Amra race. This was most likely the effect of the video that had been shown by Jake and Vicky.

Each race had their own research teams, and they could cross reference that it was true, the fact that a race from Earth was going from planet to planet, taking over civilisations and other races.

Of course, they were unable to send their whole armies as they still needed some for self protection but it was also clear that they were riding on this Alliance. If the three races didn't succeed in stopping Earth's forces, then there wasn't much hope for them stopping it on their own.

The evacuation of civilians and their treasured belongings was complete, as they moved from their planets to the one where Geo and the Tower resided. Their belongings could all be put on one of the floors making it safe.

If the main city was to suffer from the battle, then at least they wouldn't have to worry about their belongings. The plan was for Geo to also let those that didn't wish to fight, to reside in the tower.

After all, if it was destroyed they wouldn't die but instead would be someplace safe. However, none of the proud Amra wished to not take part in the war, so only the children were placed inside.

Because of this, the planned number of forces had changed slightly. The three planets surrounding the central planet had a slight curve. These planets would have a mixture of forces, Amra, Mermerial and Penswi.

No doubt they would be surprised to see three races rather than one alien race, and it was most likely that these planets would be attacked first. Because there were a larger number of Amra participating in the war, only they would protect their main city.

However, it would have their strongest protecting the place. They would have to rely on their allies to do the job of stopping the majority of the forces of the first wave.

Currently, Layla and the rescue force were on the centre planet of the three planets. This would allow them to travel to the other two quicker if there was a need to, but that wasn't their goal.

Layla, Minny, Galen, Shiro, Ceril, Russ, Stark and Shiro, were part of the operation to rescue Sil. They were all walking through the city, as they watched everyone prepare.

Large interracial groups were discussing formations and volunteering on what to do. Entering one of the buildings, led by Wince, they were to discuss their own plans as well.

It was quite a surprise for them to see Wince, she was the leader of the Mermerials, but she felt like she needed to be here. All of her people were fighting for them, and she needed to be there to make sure as many of them came back alive as possible.

"How many people will there be fighting?" Shiro asked.

"The Penswi have sent over 30,000 allies, the Amra are around 50,000 strong and then we Mermerials are the larger force with 60,000. Do remember that all of those forces will be split between four different planets so it might not seem like as many." Wince answered.

One of the unique factors of earth was just how many people there were. With all the planets they lived on, the number reached billions. With the humans, Dalki, and vampires taking part in battle, the enemy forces' number would be large.

The giant cruise ships could fit around 100,000 people on it, so it was possible with two large cruise ships that they would be going against 200,000.

"I have prepared something for you all." Wince said, and soon several Mermerials came over, with their dark blue armour, all different shapes and sizes.

"We have mentioned that one of the most important parts of this war is that the enemy doesn't know your true goal, or that you are here, so you are to disguise yourself as Mermerials the best you can."

There wasn't any armour for Stark, as he was a Penswi in the first place and he also would be wearing the fang set as well. The armour was for everyone else.

Wince had done well, and it was a perfect fit for all, with specially designed helmets that would cover the face, it was hard to tell who was behind the armour, but their powers would reveal all.

Russ was able to imitate powers so he wouldn't have so much of a problem. It was the same for Shiro, he could just use a water ability and he would fit right in with the Mermerials. This was the same for the rest of the Blade family, they would only use the full scope of their powers, when they were told they could.

For the others, they would have to rely on their physical strength until later on.

All of them looked at each other, in their armour. They were disguised well and Minny couldn't help but try to punch her little brother while he was in the armour. It wasn't a big hit, and the small boy took it well, remaining standing.

Lifting his fist up, it looked like Galen was about to do the same, until his mother picked him up off the floor.

"You two, this isn't the time for messing around." Layla said. "You know, I think you are both too young to get involved in all of this, but because of us being unable to stop this before it got this way, you are already involved, and I would rather have you by my side than not.

"Minny, Galen, if things get dangerous I want both of you to hide in your shadow space, just stay there for a few days."

The others looked at the children, they truly did feel bad that they had to be dragged into it, but they weren't ordinary children, both of them were Talens.

"Dober from the Amra have provided us with a ship made from Sedron rock. It is underneath the building we are in now, covered. You have to destroy the floor to access it. Most likely Sil will be on the giant Cruise ship that will stay out of battle, so you will have to go to them.

"You guys know when to initiate this, and you know your own plan better than I do. I wish you all luck."

——

Time went on with everyone making the small adjustments that they needed. Positioning themselves, planning routes where they could carry the injured and where they could launch attacks and more.

Now, all they needed to do was wait, and they didn't need to wait long. On a day where there were almost no clouds in sight, one could see the dark space clearly. With it, they could see the two giant Cruise ships that looked planet sized drifting through space heading towards them.

Layla looked up, tensing her fist.

"The war… has started."
