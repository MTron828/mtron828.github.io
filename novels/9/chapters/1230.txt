Chapter 1231 The big figh

When the Cursed ship was still in orbit, having yet to crash land on Planet Caladi, interesting things were happening. Peter had quickly suffered a defeat from Hilston. Hardly any strength had been used in the fight.

Despite him being a Wight and having Quinn's stats, it all seemed like nothing against the one known as the world's strongest human. This was because he was also somewhat of a superhuman himself. Right now, every piece of equipment he wore on his body was shining brightly, as the properties of the Demon tier equipment were giving him additional stats.

"From your shouting, I thought you would amount to something at least, but I guess not," Hilston said.

It was then when Peter felt like he had no hope to beat such a titan that something strange had occurred. Crashing through the ceiling of the training room and slamming down onto the ground, it felt like the whole ship had tilted on its side for a second.

Something had landed in the centre of the training room.

Looking at its back, Peter could tell it was a Dalki. He could see an unusually long tail, but worse of all, he had counted the number of spikes on its back.

'How the hell did a five spike get in here?' Peter wondered. Looking above him, he could see a hole, but it didn't look to be a forced entry, almost as if someone had purposely made a hole so the Dalki would fall through to this exact spot. Seeing the tiny spiders at work and repairing the ceiling, Peter could only assume it was the work of Logan.

'I will have to thank him once again for saving my life for a second time.' Peter thought. Thankfully, his wounds had healed from the attack he had received. The good thing was that Peter hadn't been repeatedly hurt, so his hunger hadn't started to grow yet, but seeing the situation as it was, Peter soon found himself walking towards the side of the doors. As expected, one of them had opened, but only for him. Logan really was watching everything that was going on the ship.

'I hope the two of you kill each other.' Peter left because he knew staying there for any amount of time would be so at the risk of his own life.

The five spiked Dalki was a female Dalki known as Slicer. Her tail would constantly sway back and forth, similar to a dog. It was a sign she was overjoyed at the moment.

"I knew something was here!" Slicer declared with a big smile. "A strong energy unlike any other was calling to me, and now that I have seen you, I know exactly what it is. It's that armour! It's radiating with strength even now!"

While Slicer was still overjoyed at finding such a great person in front of her. Hilston wasted no time launching an attack. A streak of constant lightning soon had struck Slicer's body. Once it was done, it didn't stop there. Hilston continued to pour his MC cells into the attack.

"Why is an ugly lizard getting in my way now of all things!" Hilston said as he added more power to the attack. The whole room soon was filled with blue lighting, so much that if one was to enter, they would have been unable to see the Dalki or anything else for that matter.

Still, after a while, Hilton hadn't stopped his attack, and it was because he could tell something was up. Soon coming through the giant lightning attack, he could see a shadow walking towards him slowly, the tail shaking back and forth intensely.

The next second, a gap in the lighting could be seen. It was strange, it looked like the lightning strike had been cut, but Hilston hadn't seen anything of the sort. Refusing to believe that the Dalki was unaffected by such an attack, Hilston tried to use his lightning strike again. Regardless of this, a cut had been made in the lighting again, and Slicer was seen continuing to walk forward.

This time paying more attention, Hilston had seen it. For a brief second, her tail had stopped wagging back and forth. He could only assume that the tail was involved in disrupting the lightning.

"Excellent." Slicer said. "You are the one after all."

The attack wasn't ineffective. Just Slicer was too overjoyed and too focused to let something as minor as pain ruin her joyous moment.

She dashed forward with a scream, clearly intending to attack.

'A punch, or a kick, my armour will deal with those things.' Hilston thought, planning to match the attack with his own strength.

However, for a second, he had seen the tail stop for a moment. He had a feeling he knew what was about to happen, and something told him he needed to avoid it at all cost. The tail had struck, making no noise at all. It was back in place, swinging as it had done before.

In front of Slicer, she had expected to see a sliced up old man, but her tail had hit nothing but air. Before she knew it, a giant fist of flames was coming at her and had punched her on her side underneath her arm. Hilston had swung his fist like a hook and had used the firepower like a jet from his elbow to give the punch as much strength as possible.

It had worked, and Slicer was soon seen flying through the air. Until she had dug her tail into the ground, but it was too sharp and had done nothing but just cut the ground like butter, not slowing her down for a second.

Before she crashed into the wall, Hilston was soon seen behind her, aiming to deliver this time, two jet fire punches in her back. With as fast as the Dalki went through the air, it would mean even more power to a strike. ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

"I get it now. No human can move that fast. You must be using an ability." Slicer said. "But you're too predictable!"

It was then that she attacked with her tail behind her. She could tell it had hit something solid, but for the first time, her tail was stuck. It hadn't gone through the object or the person she was aiming at.

Hilston was only briefly sent through the air. He was able to use his teleportation ability to reposition himself again. Slicer was right. Hilston was using the power of teleportation to move. He could dodge attacks instantly and move as far as his eyes could see, as many times as he wanted consecutively.

'That blow, it was one hit, but it charged up the Demon tier equipment this much already?' Hilston thought, looking at his gauntlets. At the same time, Slicer was smiling, for she could feel that part of her scales from where Hilston had hit her, had fallen and she was bleeding slightly.

'This is it. This is exactly what I need!" Slicer shouted in pleasure. She charged in again, going for the attack, and as expected, Hilston started to teleport around the room. Before he could teleport, he struck a lightning strike at her wound. Then, when appearing by her side or back, he would use flame filled attacks. One after another.

Doing this constantly at a fast speed, Slicer couldn't catch a break, but the more she got injured, the stronger she was getting. Soon, her tail was being used more than she had ever had to in a fight before. Hitting Hilston with great speed each time he appeared. Her tail had never been stopped by anything before. Yet today, It had constantly failed to cut the strong special diamond armour.

'This is it, this fight. The fight where I have to fight with my life on the line. This is the fight that will allow me to evolve!' She thought.

It was then that Hilston was finding something oddly strange. With his attacks, he wasn't holding back. Anyone would have been killed with a single hit, but this Dalki was still standing, and her attacks were getting stronger and faster.

For a second, Hilston was reminded of the last fight he had lost. Something was coming over him. It wasn't like when he fought the other one, and was so overpowered that he was unable to do anything. No, instead, this felt like a wall that was continuing to grow larger and more robust.

"No‚Ä¶I will not lose again!" Hilston shouted. His armour had now charged up, and he was finally ready to use one of the pieces of its active skill. However, it was at this point that the ship had crashed.

Trying to not get hurt, Hilston teleported away to safety while the ship continued to bounce across the sand. At one point, Slicer appeared above and dug her feet into his shoulders.

'While I'm in contact with another, I can't teleport!' Hilston angrily thought.

He soon was seen being pulled out of the ship, with blood dripping from his traps, covering the shoulders of his armour. When they were a distance away from the ship. Hilston grabbed the legs, and the armour around his arms started to glow. They had delivered a strange pulse.

A strange feeling had come over the Dalki, making it drop Hilston into the sand. With Hilston safely landing as well.

Slicer quickly landed herself and stood opposite the Dalki, but her joyous face from before had disappeared.

"You, you need to get stronger. You need to hurt me more. Otherwise, I won't evolve. If I can evolve, I will be ahead of the others and can be the overall leader of the Dalki. So hurt me, hurt me more!" She shouted.

"You think you're a challenge to me. You were never a challenge in the first place." Hilston said, as he activated the Demon tier armour set active skill.
