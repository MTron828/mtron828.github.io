Chapter 2501 Explosive power

Having already obtained the demon king Luce's blood, out of all of those that they needed to run into, he wasn't one of them. But they needed to get the demon kings' blood and fast, so they didn't have time to waste here.

"You would think, with the whole universe on fire and all this crap going on, that you wouldn't care about us so much?" Russ stated. "What's wrong, did we hurt your feelings when we cut off your arm?"

Hikel placed both hands on the ground, and red blood traveled in all of the cracks that were formed on the floor. When it had spread far enough, the blood exploded, creating a large formation of dust and dirt that was thrown all over the place.

This was the chance for the Champions to run. Since the large white wall was blocking their direct path toward where the others most likely were, they had to take a longer route around but listened well to the others.

"You guys are the most annoying things I have ever had to deal with before!" Luce shouted. The red mist aura moved, pushing all of the dust out of the way, and a spear, having been created from Luce's power, was in his hands, pointed right at Hikel.

Before it was thrust through him, Peter's head tail knocked it up and threw out a fist that was caught by Luce's hand.

"Didn't you learn your lesson last time?" Luce asked.

"What do you mean?" A black cat said sitting on Peter's shoulder. "Last time, you were the one who lost an arm."

Opening his mouth, the special flames that Ovinnik produced exploded and hit Luce right in the face. At first, Luce didn't react until he could feel the heat getting through to him somehow.

As the demon king averted his eyes, Peter went to throw another fist, that was until from the large white wall behind him, something had extended out that was long in size and sharp at the end.

Peter lifted up his forearm. He was covered in Qi, so the attack didn't pierce him, but it blasted him away with strong force, causing him to skid away. The moment Peter had recovered, from the large white wall, another attack shot out right toward him; he pushed through, trying to punch it back, but when the two collided, it did nothing.

Peter was seemingly having a battle with the large white wall. He was hitting back, punching as much as the attacks would come out to hit him, and the two were at a standstill. This allowed Luce to focus on Hikel. Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

With his hand, he went to hit Hikel directly, who had deflected the hit back. Punches were sent from both sides, but Luce had stronger hits. In order to help him pack a little more punch in his hits, Hikel was using his explosive power right at the point of impact, yet Luce was coming out of the smoke unharmed.

"You vampires are quite the strong creation of Immortui," Luce claimed. "But like many things that come from Immortui's power, they tend to have a downside."

A punch from Hikel missed, and when it hit the air, a large explosion went off, hitting nothing but the air. Luce pulled on the arm and shoved his white-coloured fist right into Hikel's stomach.

A shockwave of power was sent through his body as he was lifted up in the air for a moment, and right after, several spikes grew from Luce's knuckles, stabbing right through Hikel's body.

"The reason why me and Tenbris are known as Immortui's right-hand men is because we were created without a downside. All-powerful beings that don't need to rely on the moon, or need to rely on any blood, we are just strong."

Hikel had grabbed the hand that was in his stomach, and the markings on the entirety of his arms started to light up.

"I am not just a vampire," Hikel claimed. "I am one of the original vampires, who has lived for thousands and thousands of years. Do you know what that means?"

"It's your time to die?" Luce replied.

"No, we're hard to kill!"

With the markings lit up, a large swirl of red aura had arrived, and a powerful explosion, bigger than any other, had gone off in the area. The power had burned the giant trees by the side, and a shockwave was sent out like an atomic bomb.

If the trees hadn't been burnt, their branches had fallen, and they themselves had been uprooted from the ground. A large cloud of smoke could be seen from a great distance.

With his own Qi and power, Peter had been somewhat hit by the attack; the skin on his face was peeling, but he had firmly planted his feet where he was. His body would heal, especially if he got something to eat, but that wasn't his main concern.

"Hikel!" Peter shouted.

Moments before, he was fighting against the white wall that was sending attacks toward him, but it could no longer be seen, which was just worrying him even more.

"Don't tell me, did that stupid vampire just go and sacrifice himself?" Peter thought.

When the smoke finally started to settle, Peter could see Hikel was down on his knees. Both of his arms had been removed from his body. Removed was the wrong word, but they had exploded in the large explosion.

Part of his skin had been burnt off in areas, allowing for the flesh to be seen underneath, but it was slowly healing up as well. As for Luce, the Demon King he was facing, he stood right in front of him, but looked like a different being altogether.

Just like when Luce had lost his arm, he had replaced it with his power, forming a new one. Now the strange power the demon king had, was coated over his entire body, or his entire body was made up of the substance now; it was hard to tell. There were no clothes on his body, and he just looked like a mannequin at a shopping mall, but one of the most horrifying, fear inspiring, mannequins out there, since the power emitting from him was making them all shake.

"You managed to surprise me with how much power you had there," Luce exclaimed. "I never thought that I would have to use my demon form in a situation like this, yet here I am. I thought only one of you was irritating, but it seems like the whole lot of you are."

Appearing by Hikel's side was the Boneclaw; it quickly grabbed his body with its large claws and then went straight by Peter's side.

Right now Hikel was still alive, but without both of his arms, he had pretty much done everything he could do. Yet his opponent now looked completely fine.

"Hey, you look different. I guess that means we're managing to push you a bit now, huh? Are you getting a little worried?" A voice said from behind.

When turning around, Luce could see Russ; he was standing right where the wall once was. While Luce was dealing with the other two, Russ could have easily stopped the wall.

With his Penswi legs, he could have sprinted past Luce and then taken his black sword and hit the wall, freeing up a chance for Peter to fight and help Hikel.

But how could he pass this opportunity? Using the black sword would get rid of this power, turning it into as if it was nothing, but if he placed his hand that had the god slayer item onto the wall, then he could go ahead and absorb all of the energy.

Doing so, the wall had disappeared, and it wasn't because of Hikel's explosion but because of Russ' power.

"I already told you before, that I'm the most annoying one out of all of these, yet you still chose to ignore me," Russ claimed. "I hope that explosion was nice for you; will you be able to deal with a few more?"

Two figures were starting to rise from the ground. They were muscular, strong, and had several markings all over their body, and they were identical to Hikel, and it wasn't just in looks either.

Their body was in full display, similar to the current hikel with all the markings and aura surrounding him.

"Hikel, it seems like you held back using your power because you were a little afraid of dying," Russ smiled. "Don't worry, these two aren't scared of dying. They'll do a better job."
