Chapter 507 A Vampire Myth

Gavin had given all the details of the two vampires he had seen, and there was one feature that stood out. The clothing the vampire was wearing. The fur he would often wear around his neck. This was the point that stood out to Vincent, he knew It was the eighth family leader. The Snacker family.

Walking towards the castle, he thought of this as a good sign. The eighth family’s ability was telepathy. Because of this, the family was treated well as they were the communicators, but Vincent was more thankful it wasn’t one of the more dangerous abilities.

If it was, then if a fight was to occur, he would need more than himself for something like this one. If it came to it, he could rely on the times he always brought with him.

Inside the room, Katie was seriously considering something right now, whether or not to kill herself. It seemed like the easier way out for something like this. She didn’t want to go through that... she didn’t want to go through what the other women had gone through.

But before she could even decide, the doors had already opened and the young vampire man from before had walked in. Behind him the doors closed and now only him and her were in the room.

The man had changed his clothes, and was wearing just a white bathrobe, in his hand he held a glass filled with red liquid and he would constantly sniff it and smile.

"Why are you doing this?" Katie asked, hoping to buy time, what for she really didn’t know. But any second extra of her life she could add to it, she wanted to.

"You will be dead soon, so what’s the point?" The man replied and he started to take sips from the glass and walk towards her. Katie taking steps back at the same time, looking at the undressed dead women on the floor.

"Maybe I can help you. Maybe if I knew what you wanted, we could work together. Clearly you’re not killing them for blood, right? You have enough of that... So please let me help you?" She said in a soft voice. Right now, she was doing everything in her power to not sound nervous. Her strong will was overcoming her fear, but she didn’t know for how long, as her hands were still shaking behind her back.

The young man stopped to think for a second... Maybe a change, or a willing person was what he needed after all. "Well, lets see if you still think the same way after I tell you my answer." The man said.

"You see, we aren’t like you... maybe you already know that already, but we refer to ourselves as vampires. Vampires are able to mate with their own kind and produce offspring, just as you humans can."

"But, if a human and a vampire were to mate. It’s impossible for them to produce an offspring, or at least that’s what we are taught. There is also another, myth let’s call it. That if a vampire manages to get a human pregnant, then they will give birth to a Dhampire. With a Dhampire on our family’s side, then maybe no one will mess with us anymore."

Katie had no clue what the man was talking about, but at least for now it didn’t seem like he was going to kill her. But another thought had entered her mind. She was right, the reason why the girls were undressed on the floor, why he was telling her this.

He wanted to try and get her pregnant.

"You’re right, maybe keeping to one partner would have more chance of success." As he said this. He lifted his glass up and swung it to the side, letting all the blood fall onto her body.

"But you see, I just get too excited to hold back." Now his eyes were glowing red, and Katie was no longer able to move back.

Vincent and Gavin had reached the eighth castle, and they had been stopped by the outside doors by the guards. They had no permission to get in, even if Vicent was a leader. The vampires respected each other’s places.

"I’m here to give the new young master a gift." Vincent said, pointing to the boy.

The guards seeing and being able to smell it was a human and could see what was happening. And thought it was a good idea. The eighth leader was quite new, and there had been a few leaders who had come to give gifts.

Still, it wasn’t a decision for them to make, and they decided to call one of the vampire knights and wait.

Finally, the doors were opened, and at that moment. Vincent had made his move, stepping into the castle aggressively. Going past the guards and onto castle grounds.

This was the first taboo he had committed, entering another castle without their permission.

"Vincent, what are you doing, this is an offence." The knight said.

’I’m here to take what’s mine." Vincent replied, and his eyes and anger had returned from what it was when he was at the prison.

Gavin could even feel it, the feelings he had back then, they hadn’t gone away; he was suppressing them this whole time.

It didn’t take long for Vincent to figure out where the human was. For the smell of blood could be smelt the second he had stepped through those doors. This wouldn’t be too unusual but the smell was incredibly strong, something was up.

Before the vampire knight could react, Vincent threw an object down at his feet and a glass container had risen, trapping the vampire inside.

The vampire knight tried to hit the glass to break it, but with how tight spaced it was, it was hard for it to get the momentum to use his full strength. It seemed impossible for the vampire to break himself from the inside.

Soon after, Vincent was on the move and heading towards the doors.

’Sir, Vincent the tenth leader is heading in your direction now!’ The vampire knight said, sending a message to his own leader.

However, between the time the message was sent and to when Vincent had arrived, he was already inside the room, and he was looking down at the two. Katie on the floor with her clothes partly ripped, tears filled in her eyes.

And with the vampire on top of her.

She didn’t know why he had come; she didn’t really know this man that well, but what she did know was she was happy that he was here.

"Vincent... Please... help..me." She said.

"Vincent, I will talk to you later. Whatever matter you have come in for, we can talk about. Just leave!" The leader said.

Vincent was an older leader, so even though he had entered his castle without permission, he needed to still treat him quite politely. At the same time, he never thought that the reason he was here was to see a single human.

He didn’t know why, but without saying a single word, Vincent’s body started to move on its own. His hand had already been hardened and before he knew it, his hand was grabbing onto the man’s head, and his fingers were now digging into his skull.

"Vincent, what are you doing!"

’A message to all leaders, this is urgent. The tenth leader, he is trying to kill me. I repeat, the tenth leader has entered my castle and is trying to kill me. Please help or advise me on what to do...’

In the middle of his message, the nails had dug in too far into his skull, and his brain had been crushed. Letting go, the body fell to the floor.

The first part of the message had been sent to all the leaders. In the panic, he had also sent it out to Vincent himself. So he knew they were all aware of what he had done.

This wasn’t something he could simply cover up, but worse of all, he didn’t even know why he had done it.

Getting up from the floor, Katie immediately went over to Vincent and gave him a hug. The tears flowed and she couldn’t stop thanking him for saving his life.

"What did I do?" Vincent said, lost by his actions.

Soon after, Gavin had entered and was standing by the door. "Katie, you’re alive, I knew he would save you. Come on, let’s get out of..."

Suddenly, Gavin had stopped in the middle of his words, and his mouth was filled with blood. His body was quickly chucked to the side and behind him stood another vampire knight. It was a different one to the first one that Vincent had trapped. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"You! You!... You killed our leader." He said.

There was no time for thinking about what to do next. Soon the whole castle would be here and against him. Vincent was strong as a leader, but he couldn’t go up against a whole family on his own, and after that message had been sent out, he was wondering if they would have even wanted to help him.

However, Vincent was an inventor, and he never went outside without his gadgets. Pulling something off his belt, he threw it onto the floor and a portal had opened.

"Come with me." Vincent said as he picked her up in his hands and jumped through the portal. In an instant the portal had closed and it had exploded. The two of them had escaped somewhere, and the vampires had no clue where, what had happened, and why.

Experiencing the whole thing as Vincent, Quinn could feel what he was feeling at the time. The answer was, Vincent had fallen in love.
