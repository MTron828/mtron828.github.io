Quinn had been in many battles and he had experienced a large number of different abilities. He had even fought against Sil who had the ability to recreate some of the strongest powers in the world. 

He had fought against celestials with their strange energy and had experienced the power of Mundus, the messenger of the gods, with his power of time. Yet this power from Immortui, the ability to make the world and the area colourless, was something he had never experienced before. 

The power not only affected his attacks, but affected the energy from within, including the energy that was in his own body. He could feel it being eaten away, and it had even affected his shadow powers. 

The shadow, the god slayer ability that was able to protect him so many times, worked against even Mundus with his power of time, yet the energy from his own shadow that was meant to block out everything was being drained. 

If it wasn't for the shadow's effect of slowing things down, then maybe even the shadow wouldn't have worked, and Quinn wouldn't have been able to escape here, to his shadow space. 

"You two… you're okay!" Anon shouted. 

The Skully ran over with the other two by his side, but soon stopped. They realised that they weren't quite close enough to embrace or check on one another, it was just when they were thrown into this black world where they were unable to see anything, they had somewhat thought they perhaps had gone into the afterlife.

No one knew what the after life was, and none of them understood what had happened either. Now seeing both Calva and Quinn, it meant they hadn't died, or the two of them had died as well. They were hoping it wasn't the latter.

"The shadow… Thankfully it worked." Quinn said, taking in a big breath of air. 

When hit by Immortui's power, even breathing felt quite difficult.

"We escaped, we managed to actually escape from Immortui!" Calva said, staring at his large hands. He even rubbed them together, just in case he was imagining things, because he too felt like he might have been in the afterlife.

"We haven't quite escaped." Quinn said, as he stood up straight with concern on his face. He wondered, how different would things be if he had his demon form and if he had his armour. 

Was this a celestial power, would the god slayer armour be able to protect him from something like this, and even if it could what about the rest? So far Quinn had only experienced a glimpse of Immortui's powers and already he had so many questions whether he could win or not, he hadn't even taken a hit from the other side. 

"What do you mean, where are we?" Calva asked. 

"This is part of my power, for now we are simply just hiding from Immortui, but we can't hide here forever, and I'm sure someone like him will find a way to break in, even here. In fact, there is a good chance that if his power is still active, that eventually this will break as well and all of us will end up back on the battlefield." Quinn explained. 

Simultaneously, nearly all of them gulped. 

"Do you know a way… to battle against this power?" Quinn asked. 

Calva was thinking, he was thinking of the battle he had against Immortui, in truth, he couldn't think of a way, but he didn't want to say that, so instead he decided to provide information. 

"The power, it seems his own body is unaffected by it. While everything around him and the energy around is being drained, he can move just fine. His strength and speed is no less than the other demon kings, but because of this power, he is always above the others. 

"When going against him, he had used the power continuously for a long time, so I have no idea how long he can use or keep this up for. However, I believe that his power has to have a range. You saw him use it only on the palm of his hands at first, then it spread out. As long as you are out of the colourless zone you will be unaffected." 

It was a tactic, the only tactic that Calva could think of, but not one they could use. Right now, they were already in the colourless zone. If Quinn came out, he would be drained, and Immortui would catch him before he could escape. 

Not only that, but when Quinn looked around him, he couldn't see the need of the colourless zone either. 

'That could be because I was being affected by the colourless power.' Quinn thought. 'Since it's covering a certain area, then from the inside, everything outside still appears colourless, but it's only a guess. If his range is far, then I will have to try and fight him from a distance.' 

"What about your demon form!" Ekeke shouted. 

Moments ago, they were frightened of the demon form, but it seemed to be their only hope in a situation like this. Calva didn't want to say anything, but he thought even the demon form would be affected by the colourless power. Still, it was worth a try at least. 

"I can't." Quinn answers. "I don't have the energy to do that again." 

"Then can't we just hide in here, until you can?" Tuni asked. 

The least they could do was stay in here until the powers of Immortui affected the hiding place. Who knew if it even would. Maybe they could stay in here indefinitely.

Quinn shook his head. 

"It's not possible." 

It wasn't the time for him to go into details about the matter but the shadow space while inside it had a strange effect. The passage of time didn't really move. While inside, his blood aura, his active skills, and his demon form reset none of it would be changed. 

Quinn couldn't just enter his shadow space, wait for his powers to come back and then fight again. A good example of this was Minny, when she had remained in the shadow space for so long, she hadn't aged at all once coming out of it. 

So no matter how long they stayed here, it wouldn't make a difference, and just in case Immrotui would break them out of here, he needed to think of something fast. 

"There's only one thing I can do." Quinn said, and he looked over at the Skully. Who would have thought that his encounters with these strangers would lead to this, lead to him trusting them with an important task. 

"This isn't probably what you want to hear right now, but it's what you have to hear." Quinn said, looking at them each dead straight in the eye. "I have lost this fight… no matter what I do, I will lose this fight."
