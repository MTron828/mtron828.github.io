Physical attacks, Blood Aura, and Qi, all of these powers that Quinn had focused on training the most were useless against the phoenix, and to top it off, he was suffering from a side effect from the phoenix's power lowering his strength in general.

Not only that, but being so close to the phoenix in this type of heat seemed to somewhat affect him as well. He was feeling tired far quicker than usual, and he hadn't even moved that much.

'The only thing that works so far is the shadow so I'm just going to have to use that!' Quinn used the shadow portals to hop by the side of the phoenix's face, while still encasing both of his gauntlets in the shadow.

His fists were around ten times bigger than they usually would have been, and with the Nitro Accelerate active most of his speed had recovered. With this, he swung his hands twice, hitting the phoenix on one side of its face.

Its head swung but was met with another large shadow fist, before Quinn lifted both of his hands and slammed it on top of the phoenix's head.

It looked to be having some sort of effect as the phoenix shrieked but as it did, flames rose from its body upward. Quickly once again, Quinn had to do his best to get out there as he used the portals to send himself back down on the ground.

'The effect of the phoenix, I'm pretty sure with how I'm feeling it's also affecting my endurance. If it manages to get me with a clean hit with that power of its, then I will become nothing but ashes.' Quinn thought.

The problem was there was a slight delay when he would switch between using the shadow to attack and using the guns to create shadow portals. Quinn could create shadow portals without the guns, but due to the debuff it was much slower than using the guns that were unaffected.

The other problem with the guns was there was no trigger, it was almost linked to his body as the trigger part was pretty much infused with his body.

'Hit without getting hit, I can do this!' Quinn ran over on the ground, and pillars of fire started to burst out from the floor.

Using all his senses, he was guessing where the pillars of fire would appear. Slight cracks on the ground, thinking what the phoenix would do, and moving in unpredictable patterns. So far it was working.

Sprinting up ahead, Quinn had condensed the shadow and his Qi even more in his hand making it slightly larger again. Reaching the foot and underneath the phoenix, he stomped on the ground, and swung his fist with all his body weight slamming it right into the leg.

The whole giant phoenix was lifted on its side, and now it looked like its body was about to come crashing down on him.

'Running won't be fast enough, and I can't switch to my gun in time. I hope this works.'

Gathering his blood aura that he hadn't been using in the fight, his entire body was covered in head to toe, but he started to shape it, making a point, making his whole body look like that of an arrow.

The second it looked like the body of the phoenix was about to hit him, Quinn pushed off and spun his body. The red aura hit the phoenix and as predicted, it passed right through its body.

All of the attacks went through the body like they were just flames, so why would it be any different this time. Quinn was just inside the large arrow of red aura.

Now on the other side, Quinn could see the phoenix had collapsed, still with the red aura surrounding his body, he dived back down spinning it, while gathering the shadow around his two hands.

Lifting them both in the air, he swung them down with great force as much as he could and hit the phoenix clean on its body. It screamed in pain once again, and the phoenix was getting ready to burst out a wave of heat but Quinn was ready for this as he was able to retreat in time with the guns this time.Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

'Quinn is extremely skilled, and even though most would have thought to stop using the red aura as it is useless, he has somehow still managed to utilise his powers to help him in his fight.' Mundus observed. 'With this alone, it won't be enough though, can you resolve the problem?'

The fight between Quinn and the phoenix continued in a similar fashion, with Quinn doing a lot of the attacking. He hadn't been hit directly by the flames, and utilised all his skills to hurt the god slayer again and again.

These blows were enough to damage many god slayers and yet, the phoenix looked fine. There were no signs of slowed movements, damage to its body, blood or any of the sort. It was almost impossible for Quinn to tell what was happening. Was he winning the fight or not?

Everything about the fight, being careful not to get hit, the damage and the effect on his stats was mentally draining him which was allowing him to get tired quicker, and then there was another problem.

[Nitro Accelerate has ended]

'Crap, I didn't rely on it so much in the fight but it let me pull off quicker attacks and dodge a few hits here and there when I needed it. I guess I just need to use it sparingly, I can still use the Nitro Accelerate, it will just take my HP doing so.' Quinn thought.

The fight continued with Quinn doing just that, and his pattern continued the same as it did, he tried to block out the thoughts in his head. Trying to concentrate on doing just as much damage as he could.

If he let the distractions get to him, it would just tire him out even more, and once in a while he was forced to use the Nitro Accelerate skill. After three hours of continuous fighting against the phoenix, Quinn was starting to feel extremely spent.

His MC cells were unlimited allowing him to use the shadow as much as he wished, but his stamina was already being affected, and his Qi was as well. It took a while for both of these to recover.

If he ran out of Qi, then the shadow would no longer have as much of a solid form as it had done so far during the fight, which meant there would be no way for him to defeat his opponent.

'I have to think, I don't have much time left with this. How did the god slayers manage to defeat the phoenix before? Did they just over power it with Mundus? No, even with his time stop ability that wouldn't help in this situation either.

'Is it celestial energy? Even if that was the case I don't have that anymore, but I would think that the god slayer bullet would have the same effect but it's unable to do anything.'

The situation wasn't getting any better either, in order to avoid a stomp from the phoenix's foot in time Quinn had to use the Nitro accelerate once again, which he had been doing throughout the fight.

[20/100 HP]

'I only have 20 HP left‚Ä¶ without the Nitro accelerate‚Ä¶ everything‚Ä¶ everything is working against me!' Quinn thought. 'I already used the blood up from my blood banks. If this is how it's going to end, then do I have no choice but to use that?

'I have to, I'm not sure it will do anything, but I can't die here, to some giant fire bird!' Quinn thought.

For the first time during the fight in a while Quinn had used his guns to move a bit further out of range, and off the mountaintop, seeing the bird from a distance.

'I didn't want to use this while Mundus was watching but I have no choice.'
