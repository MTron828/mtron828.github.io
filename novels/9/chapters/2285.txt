[ASURA'S RAGE]

With both his gauntlets glowing, Quinn threw out a desperate punch, right now he also had the mask converted to the fire blood energy, allowing for the blood fire aura to spew out behind his fists.

Seeing this, Ray threw out a fist of his own and the two of them collided. Immediately after, Quinn threw out another fist and Ray matched that as well. The two of them were looking for areas to hit each other but instead, both of them were hitting out a flurry of punches that were just hitting knuckle on knuckle, gauntlet on gauntlet, and for the first time, it looked like the traded blows were equal in strength.

Each blow that was blocked or exchanged by Quinn and Ray was devastating to the planet. The two of them didn't realise it themselves, but they had already destroyed a few layers of the ground beneath them.

Not just where they stood but almost for the entire planet. This was because Quinn had his special boots that allowed him to hover and fight just as if he was on the floor, while Ray had his wings.

When the two eventually touched the ground, they were too focused on the fight, just believing they were touching the ground.

But, their powers were destroying the planet bit by bit, even without any of the attacks landing on the planet.

Nearly all of the vampires had already gone off the planet, having been taken away, but there were some that were too injured to move. They had been swept up in the battle, most likely already dead from the effects of the fight

That was how devastating the energy was that was radiating off the two. However, there were a few that had decided to stay behind. The last of the ships from the Marpo Cruise had left a while ago, attempting to avoid the fight, and not be caught up in whatever was happening, but three originals had decided to stay behind.

Hikel, the fourth original leader, along with Edvard and Bianca. These were all part of the Punisher's Convent. Only Grenlet had decided to leave, stating that there was no reason for them to stay there.

Their presence wasn't going to change anything. Hikel knew he was right, but there was a reason why he was staying here.

"I‚Ä¶ never thought two people could even get so strong." Bianca said, watching from a distance.

In fact, all three of them had decided to stay behind the tower that was still standing. The energy that was swirling about was hitting the tower, but the strange defence mechanism seemed to protect it.

The distance between the tower and the fight was incredibly far. With their eyes alone one wouldn't be able to even see the three of them, that was if they were a regular human. However, the original vampires had enhanced vision and were watching the fight from afar, too afraid to get close and get swept up in everything.

Although it was now easier for them to move. The strange power from before had disappeared after the last ship had left. This was because Quinn had cancelled the skill. It had no effect on Ray, and even in the middle of the fight, Quinn was worried about others.

What if there were those badly injured on the ground unable to move, it was quite possible that they could die due to his skill being used.

"I understand what you mean." Edvard replied to Bianca's comment from before. "When I wore that dragon armour in the past, I thought that I had reached the pinnacle of power. I wouldn't be afraid of anyone back in the past with the armour.

"But now‚Ä¶ I see that I hardly drew out any of its power. Even with the armour I wouldn't last against the two of them."

Bianca looked at Hikel who had yet to say a word, and his eyes were fixed on every movement of the fight as if he was a madman.

"Why‚Ä¶ did you choose to stay here?" Bianca asked.

Hikel smiled in response to that question.

"I could ask the two of you the same question." Hikel stated. "Throughout our time, there has been a lot that has happened. Yet even for as long as we have lived, no fight, nothing quite on the scale of this has happened before.

"The fact that Quinn mentioned the Punisher's Convent means that we are a part of this, whether it is small or big, who knows. What I do want to know though, is how all of this ends, and whether the decision I made was the right one. I want to see with my own eyes‚Ä¶ the outcome of everything that is to take place."

There were more eyes on the fight than Quinn thought, because even in the tower itself, the Amra were able to get a closer look at everything that was happening. On the floor, the projector played, showing the fight that was taking place.

"Come on Quinn!" One of the Amra shouted as the punches were thrown at each other. Large destructive blows.

"We put all our sweat into making that armour, you have to win!" Another shouted.

Originally, the projector was set a bit away from the village. Because it was placed among the injured Amra that were receiving treatment. Eventually though, due to all the cheering and noise that was going on, those that were in the village until now had decided to come out.

They were the Amra, the children, and those that felt too weak to take part in the fight. Some had gathered to help the injured while news had spread of the big fight taking place. All of them knew of Quinn and while watching the fight it felt like once again he was fighting for their fate.

"Quinn, you have to win this fight!" Ronkin shouted. His memories still fresh with everything Quinn had done.

"I don't even know of the consequences of what would happen if he were to lose." Jeouk stated.

On top of those in the tower that were watching, there were also those in the celestial spaces as well. The fight wasn't quite what they had expected as it was closer than they thought.

Still, all of them who were watching one way or another had played a big part.

‚Äî‚Äî

The focus on the battle was so much on Quinn, that there was something else going on the planet that no one had realised.

Due to the shockwaves and power released from the battle between the two strong foes, a particular body that was originally near the fight scene had been moved away.

It continued to be pushed back more and more with every attack, the body in question was Jim.

Jim's body laid there flat on the ground, parts of its skin and flesh burnt, but that's when something strange started to occur. All the crystals that were embedded into Jim's body, they started to light up.

They shined so bright, all at once that the glow could even be seen through the clothes. Suddenly the glow of power started to beat, just like a heart. The whole body was pulsing like a heartbeat, as it was lfited of the ground.

The skin on Jim's body, the wounds internal and external they were all healing by the strange power, until it had suddenly vanished. Jim opened up his eyes, and one of the crystals had popped out of his arm.

It fell to the floor, black in colour. It was no longer like the other crystals on Jim's body that were filled with a mystic space-like colour swirling around.

"Damn it, did I f*cking die!" Jim said to himself.

The next moment, another large wave of energy had hit Jim, skidding him across the floor it was so powerful. He lifted his arm, to cover his head, and eventually was able to see what was going on between his arms.

"It was him, it was Quinn. Damn that guy, that b*stard‚Ä¶ I'll rip him to shreds!" Jim said.
