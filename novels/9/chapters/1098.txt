Chapter 1099 - The return of a trio

With Quinn gone, it made for a slightly awkward ride back to the Cursed ship with just Richard and Sam. Only a few people interacted with Richard and even then it was mostly out of pure necessity than an actual choice. As for Sam he had actually never regarded the old man to be that bothersome, but that was probably because Eno didn’t regard Sam as someone who would, or for that matter could, disrupt his grand ambition of getting rid of the Dalki.

The reason why Sam was feeling a bit tense now was due to what they had all witnessed in that interrogation room. ​​Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Doing his best to avoid the other, Sam would just stare out of the large window of the ship, looking out into the vastness of space while thinking of all the important matters he would have to deal with once they landed. At the same time he was consistently responding to all the emails that had piled up, but he also couldn’t help but try to keep one eye on Eno at all times.

’Eno, you say you’re on the side of humans, but what about people like us? Humans that have turned into vampires but don’t really fit into the vampire society?’ Sam wondered.

What’s more he was curious what Richard Eno was planning to do once the Dalki had been dealt with. He was someone that had faked his own sleep and was now meddling with the affairs of later generations. Did he see himself as some type of god, someone who was meant to create harmony?

Despite Eno claiming he cared for humans, he was not one to shy away from ending their lives in a heartbeat, claiming it was for the overall picture, and it seemed like he also felt the same way about vampires.

’Is this what happens when one has lived for far too long? After one has seen all those close to oneself die?’ Sam started to question. These thoughts in itself were troubling Sam.

If it ever came to the point that he would do something Eno didn’t like, would the other even hesitate to get rid of him? What about the Cursed faction? Would he want to get rid of them as well after their fight with the Dalki, since they might not fit in with the rest of humanity?

"Sam." Eno suddenly spoke his name, which jolted the young man. "There was something I hadn’t had the chance to tell you, but now that it’s just the two of us together, I thought it might be best for me to speak my mind."

’Did I mess up somewhere?!’ Having just thought about all these things, Sam’s hands were shaking and he didn’t want to turn around. Instead he tapped his watch bringing up a report like it was something very important that could not wait. Alas, the Eno either didn’t see it or simply didn’t care.

"I wanted to thank you. In my evaluation of the Cursed faction, you are one of the major factors of why it has been able to progress so far." Eno explained. "In all honesty, I never thought someone like Quinn would actually be able to grow in time to become one of the major tools to stop the Dalki. I didn’t quite understand how he was able to build up such a strong faction around him, but after looking at his surroundings, I came to learn that it was because Quinn didn’t do everything on his own."

"He did so with the people around him, and with the help of others, especially you. You are a hard worker and you should be credited for that." Eno said, and with that he headed off into the break room.

’Did he just... compliment me? What was that all about?’ Sam tried to comprehend what had just happened. Still, he couldn’t help but feel a little proud. It wasn’t that Quinn had never thanked him, but for someone else to see and acknowledge his efforts really did remind him of his roots and where he had come from.

As someone who had hit the cap on his MC cells rather early, he had eventually accepted that he would be unable to get any stronger, so for a long time he had feared he would amount to nothing. His younger self would have never imagined that in the future he would be the second in charge of a faction that would be one of the great three powers that made up the group of world leaders.

’My parents are still on earth... once all of this is over it would be nice to bring them on the ship.’ Thinking of this, it reminded Sam of something, and he went ahead to check if the request he had sent out earlier had come through.

Finally, Sam and Eno had returned to the Cursed ship, and there were a few things they both needed to do. First Sam immediately called a meeting between the Cursed faction leaders. Apart from updating them on what had happened when they had been out with Quinn, he also intended to inform them on their movement to Blade Island.

They would have to decide on the members that would be going with them. After all, a core group of people always needed to be left behind to look after the Cursed ship, but due to how dangerous Blade Osland or the Demon tier beast could be, they also needed to take a substantial force.

"I am here to bring you my report, Sir." Brock bowed down before the other. "It turns out that the Blades have completely abandoned the island. They have taken everything with them, however I have been able to confirm two things."

"The tablet has remained untouched, so it still has plenty of power within it. You should be able to use it as you wish. However, there is a slight problem. They seem to have left behind the Demon tier dragon."

"I can only assume the dragon had no d.e.s.i.r.e to leave the island, which is a good thing, but it may be harder to control it if that is indeed the case. It’s unclear if it is waiting for something on the island or if it’s merely its whim. I have some people looking over it for the time being who will report as soon as possible."

"It means we have to move as quickly as possible." Eno replied. "Still, I don’t think the dragon will move anytime soon, their ability has a lasting effect. Depending on when the Blades had left the dragon it should still be a bit confused, and it probably considers the island its home."

"But what would happen if we tried to remove a beast from its home?"

Eno knew that perhaps even with Sil using all his abilities, this wouldn’t be so easy.

"Another point if I may add." Brock said. "Although I can confirm that the Blades are no longer on the island, I have been unable to track them down anywhere, which is worrisome. If preparations have begun, I assume it’s time I bring her over?"

——

After the meeting between the Cursed leaders was over, many of them were left dumbfounded. Finally, Megan, who had been the only leader who was human, had learned the truth about who they all were. Of course, it came as a shock, she had been sure they were joking about everything at first, so some of them showed her that it was very, very true.

Now, Sam had something else to attend to, as he had been informed that he had visitors that had also arrived on the ship. Exiting the command centre, Sam was taking the electrical bridge to move him to the large hall.

’That was quick work by them, I guess they might be excited to finally be here again.’ Sam thought.

Stepping off the bridge, Sam continued to walk forward, until he could see three people surrounded by members of the Cursed faction. They stood tall and strong and looked a little nervous.

"It looks like you have finally all made it here." Sam greeted them, putting on a big smile. "Please state your names."

"My name is Swin, Sir!" The boy shouted, giving a salute.

"My name is Venus, Sir!" Another shouted.

’Which means..’

"My name is Shiro, Sir!" The last one replied.

The three boys were students from Quinn’s homeroom class. They had decided to join the Cursed faction and had been sent to one of the safer portal planets, but Quinn had requested for the three of them to be brought on board the ship instead.

"I have to thank you, Shiro. You have a big job ahead of you. I, Quinn and the whole Cursed faction will owe you a lot." Sam bowed down before the other, despite his high rank..

"No problem, Sir! I will do anything if it’s in regards to helping out Quinn, the Cursed leaders, the Cursed faction, and definitely to help out Sil!"
