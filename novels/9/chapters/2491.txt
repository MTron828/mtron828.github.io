Chapter 2492 A strong Sil

The training continued, but only because Quinn wanted to find a way to enhance his fighting. It would have been very easy for him to just overpower all three of them with his blood aura, but that would make the whole training pointless.

The idea was to get used to the three variations of attacks coming from all sides. Immortui had the same, if not greater power than him, so overpowering wasn't an option.

Several kicks were being delivered by Pultra through the air, and Quinn had moved in closer, showing no fear. He struck back with kicks of his own, matching them. While doing so, he could see Shinto coming down with his axe full of black flames.

A shadow portal had opened up behind him, and reaching out from the shadow portal was a shadow hand. It wasn't Quinn's own hand. It encased him from behind, wrapping around his body, having grabbed him midair.

It was the few seconds that Quinn needed as he used his shadow travel to go underneath Pultra, and then when he was back on the ground, he had a blood spear in his hand that was hurled directly at Shinto. It crashed into the axe, sparking against the flames. With Pultra on him, Quinn reached out his hand and used the shadow lock, making her disappear.

He then could see a bone spear being hurled toward him from Calva. Letting her back out, the spear had crashed into Pultra, and Quinn's fist had hit her right in the stomach. The spear from Calva was embedded into her back, pulling it out, she threw it onto the floor. Her wound was healing quickly, which was another trait of one of her powers.

"It seems you've managed to find your answer," Pultra said, raising her hand. It was a signal to the others as a way to stop the fight, at least for now.

"I've grown stronger through multiple ways, with all my equipment and blood powers. At times, when I gain one new power that seems overwhelmingly stronger, I forget about the other things I can do because they seem useless.

"But the shadow is the answer. The shadow's power is extremely strong, but it's a power that becomes even stronger when utilized with everything I have. I learned that when I mixed the shadow with my blood powers.

"But doing so, I neglected my old ways of fighting. In a way, fighting like this, stripping everything back to the bare minimum that I had before. It showed me what I can do with everything I have, thank you."

After finishing that sentence, a notification came up from the system. [All god slayer armour has been repaired]

"Let's keep going, I want to try a few things."

The group didn't know a lot about the black sword and where it originally came from, apart from the fact that it was a marked weapon, branded by Immortui. It felt like a powerful soul had been sealed away in the sword.

Quinn was the one who had noticed the marking and eventually removed it. It lessened the burden one had when needing to use the sword, but it seemed that the soul's strong emotions would still go to the user who was using it.

The soul inside the sword had next to no recollection of what happened. Based on the marking and what had occurred, they could imagine that Immortui and the Black Swordsman had gone through a battle, and the end result was what it was.

"Hahaha!" Immortui laughed. "I have no idea what your power is, but it certainly is the most interesting one I have come against. To think you were able to present this to me!"

Rushing forward with his sword in hand, the Black Swordsman thrust it forward. When the tip touched the colourless zone, the power almost instantly disappeared, breaking, and the colour in the area had returned.

"I see, I see, it's not some type of illusion after all," Immortui said. "But did you really think this would pose a problem to me? I was the one who defeated him before, so I will just have to do the same thing again!"

Immortui rushed forward from his position, and the serpent over his shoulder started to swirl around his hand. Sil had been watching him carefully; it was clear this attack was something that he couldn't just repeat over and over again, otherwise he would have repeatedly used it, since during the fight every time he did, he had finished off around ten percent of Sil's forces.

When the distance between the two had closed to around the halfway mark, the clones teleported in closer, each of them having a condensed lightning whip in their hands. They swung them, and they wrapped around Immortui's legs. Several of the lightning whips were fully wrapped around the armoured part of his body. The lightning effect of the whips didn't seem to be working, but they managed to still hold him back, enough time for Sil to draw out another demon-tier sword , pulling the same one that had broke , directly from Immortui's memories. He dashed in using his super speed and slashed the sword against Immortui's chest.

A large golden slash appeared in the air, hitting Immortui back, but the red aura that thickly covered his skin seemed to block the attack.

"I want to tell you something, Immortui!" Sil shouted as he carried on speeding around him, striking him bit by bit. "Do you know how I was able to catch you just now, how my clones were able to know where you were? It's because I could see your next move. I have the ability of foresight; it allows me to know what you are going to do before you're going to do it.

"My vision changes, and these spirit-like images play out the scene beforehand!"

With how annoying Sil was being to Immortui, he decided to just throw his fist to the ground; the immense amount of power exploded, and rocks flew up in the air as if a volcano had exploded.

The lightning whips that had been attached to Immortui's legs had been destroyed, but the real Sil had retreated, standing next to the Black Swordsman that had blocked the lingering after-effect of the shockwave that had been sent out.

"You might have been able to take him out before, but that was when you were fighting him alone. I have to say, thank you for listening to me." Sil's eyes glinted a light grey for a moment before returning to normal. He now had his foresight ability as well.

Although Sil was able to change his powers as much as he wished, he couldn't use two powers at the same time. There were instances where it could feel that way, such as using his super speed and then switching to super strength at the last moment to give a bigger effect.

Or using one power after the other, such as raising a rock from the ground and then destroying it with his lightning, but he couldn't use both at the same time. So his foresight ability was something that he needed to constantly turn on and off during battle.

Making full use of it was tricky; however, with Russ' power, Sil could use multiple powers, especially his own, because Immortui had seen what had been used against him. Sil could access Immortui's mind and use all of the powers he had in the fight so far.

However, there was one thing he couldn't summon, and that was the foresight ability. This was because it was something Immortui had no knowledge of; he had never physically seen it. Which was why Sil had informed him of exactly what his power was. Holding the golden sword out, lightning started to gather in his hand and was sparkling on the outside.

'The power of lightning, a demon-tier sword, super speed, super strength, and foresight. Along with all of these, and the Black Swordsman, I can do this.'

These were all of the things that Sil was using with Russ' power; he had to because if he switched abilities, everything would disappear, which also meant Sil was burning through a large amount of MC cells at this moment.
