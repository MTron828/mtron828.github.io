Chapter 1155 A copyca

As soon as the news about the sighting of the Demi-god tier beast was revealed, it felt as if the entire base had started to mobilise. Even the lab was busy and soldiers, together with researchers, could be seen pulling out the beasts. The non-military folk all came out to cheer the soldiers before they set out.

By the time Quinn and Longblade had left the capsules, half of the arena had already left. The first thing the Colonel did was to wave over ’Bucky’, who appeared by his side nearly instantly.

’Well that confirms it. He actually is that fast. I was sure that Green Boy had pulled some trick on the VR machine, but unless one has trained for years and has perfected their body over time no one should be capable of such a thing. It’s actually scary to think how fast he would be if he had put on some decent beast gear.’ Longblade thought.

Using his ability he could see that there was nothing he could do, even with his favorite sword against the unarmed boy. Bucky would be able to counter him no matter what he did. A shiver ran down the military leader’s spine as something even more frightening was revealed. If Longblade attacked this person right now with the intention to kill him, he would be defeated by him with his bare fists.

"I didn’t know the Cursed faction had someone who is so talented in martial arts and the way of the sword. You said your name is Bucky, correct? That movement you pulled at the end, it looked a little awkward but familiar. Who is your teacher?" Longblade asked.

The aggression and arrogant tone that had been present in Longblade’s tone upon their arrival had disappeared. Quinn didn’t know about the other Earthborn soldiers, but it became apparent that he had at least earned a bit of respect from this man.

As for how to answer the question, right now he wasn’t Quinn, but ’Bucky’. As for the last move...

"My teacher’s name is Leo Suiyan." Quinn eventually answered truthfully.

The second Longblade heard the person’s name, his eyes lit up, and now he understood why the move looked so familiar to him. Leo Suiyan was someone he had admired greatly. Longblade, although a middle aged man, had been inspired to pick up the sword due to seeing the war hero Leo in battle.

In the past he had been someone who relied on guns for battle, but they had proven useless against the Dalki. One day, he had the fortune of being saved by the Blind Swordsman, allowing him to witness Leo’s swordsmanship. It was one of the reasons he vehemently defended the statement that the sword was the best weapon one could have and why he had insisted on teaching it to those under him.

"Does that mean Leo is with the Cursed faction?" He asked.

That was when Quinn also realised that not everyone seemed to associate Leo with being part of the Cursed faction. He had never been seen in public with them and he had naturally refused all sorts of interviews. Of course, that also meant that the world was still unaware that their war hero was now one of the V many feared.

"He is someone with close ties to the Cursed faction but he freely does as he wishes." Quinn answered because that’s how he honestly felt about Leo. Regardless if he was his Vampire Knight or not, to Quinn he was his first teacher and someone he still had a lot to learn from.

"I see, in that case I’m even more sorry for the disrespect I have caused his student so far. You are a strong person, Bucky, and I wish you could introduce me to your teacher someday. I would like to personally thank him for what he did in the past." Looking over, Longblade saw his men already waiting for him. If they had found the trail of the beast, it was safe to assume that Pure did as well.

"The Cursed faction are welcome to come along with me personally as we look for the Demi-god tier beast. Please meet us outside the main Shelter’s headquarters. I will be waiting for you there and will be speaking to Nathan." Longblade said, before he went off to coordinate the plan they had put in place.

It looked like his fun little game had worked out for the best for all of them. Perhaps Longblade had never intended to put much woe into the Cursed faction, but now it seemed like his opinion of them had changed.

Since the field was not empty of soldiers, Quinn quickly went over to where his friends were and he could tell immediately that Layla was suffering with sweat running down her face and that she was exhausted. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"What happened?" Quinn asked as it was fairly obvious the two hadn’t just gone off to the toilet at the same time. Logan filled him in, about how one of Pure’s members had been present in the crowd and they had eventually tracked him down and that they had captured him, in the hopes he might reveal some intel.

Going by her injuries, Quinn decided to have a quick look at Layla and could tell straight away what the problem was. The amount of Qi in her body was still too much for her body to handle. Quinn had the body of a Vampire Lord and even then, using Qi would put a lot of strain on himself.

For Layla, it was more beneficial for her to use the second stage of qi, or perhaps the third stage, since the Qi would leave the body, rather then reinforce it. If Layla continued to use the first stage to power herself, it would only harm her body, doing more damage than good in the long run, especially with the large quantity she had inherited from her mother.

"Layla, you need to use less Qi on your body. When you shoot it from your arrows it’s okay since it’s not affecting your body so much, but if you use it too much you might damage your body. Imagine if Logan wasn’t there at the time."

"The rebound on your body was too much and any other pure members would have been able to hurt you." It sounded and felt like to Quinn he was telling off a child. The thing was Quinn didn’t really understand why Layla had gone after him in the first place, because she hadn’t explained what exactly Agent 11 had said about her mother.

Still, she knew she had done wrong, so she listened to him without complaining.

"Fex, I think it would be best if you stay here for now and look after our captive. Maybe it’s best for you to take him somewhere quiet and ask him the question we need. How many pure members they have, what their goal is and so on. Being a high ranking agent he should know a lot." Quinn ordered.

Fex honestly wanted to pretest, he wanted to go with them but understood. Since Pure was most likely also going after the Demi-god tier beast carrying another person around would be a huge distraction. If anything while no one was keeping a good eye on them, it was the perfect time to do some investigation of their own.

"Logan, it sounds like the army seems to be making movements. My guess is they’re going to try and use some of the beasts that they have captured as bait for the Demi-god tier beast. The stronger ones should have left the Shelter, or will be protecting the outside walls. If you can, I think this would be the perfect time to head inside, and maybe you can find more information. There are some interesting things there."

"Lastly, me, Sil, Shiro and Layla will head off with Longblade and his group. Hopefully when we come back, we’ll have good news for you all." Quinn said with a smile. With everyone knowing what they needed to do, it was time for them to move out.

’Vorden, Raten, it won’t be long until I can see you again.’ Sil thought.
