Chapter 1384 - The Leaders' Growth (Part 2)

The leaders looked pleased about Quinn's remark, and it was for more reasons than one. Vincent hadn't given them respect. Some of the leaders, such as Lee, Sunny, Jin and so on were leaders even when Vincent was around.

Yet, he treated them as if they were young upstarts, but for the other leaders they were excited for a different reason. There were those like Nicu that disliked Quinn, and this was a chance to pound the face of someone who looked exactly like him, but would be far weaker.

"It seems like you were all holding back, too afraid to reveal your full strength, worried about infighting. Well, now we all have a common enemy, so let's grow stronger together instead of worrying about individual families!" Quinn said. T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

The leaders agreed, and Fex was put to work immediately. He went into the explanation to them all about the Inner Blood weapon. It was a struggle since Fex wasn't the best person at explaining such things. After practising for a while, the leaders found little success. Lee had to pretend that he no didn't know about the Blood weapon, afraid he would get his son into some type of trouble.

There was also another Quinn was keeping an eye on, and that was Vincent. Although he could use blood abilities, Quinn was unsure if he would have an inner blood weapon as well. Since he wasn't exactly human.

After no results were given, and since they couldn't stay doing the same thing forever, it was time to go onto the sparring section.

The younger leaders were more willing to test their powers against each other. In contrast, the older ones were still reserved in showing off their strength, but what was surprising was Vincent. With his new body, he was easily able to overpower most of the vampires despite still lacking an actual ability.

Then there was Vincent.

"Remind me why I'm the only one going up against two at once?" Vincent asked.

"These two are new leaders, so you should be able to handle this, besides. My body isn't that weak!" Quinn shouted back.

The leaders were Nicu and Katori. Their abilities hadn't fully developed, and they had next to no experience fighting, but they had the potential to be just as strong as the leaders before them.

However, during the fight, that didn't seem to be the case, Vincent was able to dodge all the sword strikes with ease, and with a single hit to Nicu in the stomach, it looked like he wouldn't be getting up for a long time. Then, with a kick to Katori's side, the results were quite similar.

It didn't matter if Vincent was weaker than them at blood control, when he would never be fighting them in a match with blood in the first place. With the beast armour and stats like Quinn, most leaders just couldn't do anything.

"Could you not go a bit easier on them? If it's too one-sided, then this isn't exactly training!" Quinn yelled.

"Wait, so they can go as hard as they want against me, but I can't do the same to them!" Vincent argued back.

It was because of this that Vincent's opponents needed to change. When going up against the more experienced battles, it seemed to be harder for Vicnent, mainly due to abilities. Since Vincent didn't have any himself, and they knew what his strengths were, they were being cautious.

This was exactly what Quinn wanted so they could all improve together.

"Watching all this fighting makes me want to spar a bit."

"Please don't your majesty," Muka replied. "We would have to all go up against you together if you were to get anything out of it."

Muka quickly realised the mistake that she had made. She might have just given him a horrible idea, so she decided it was best for her to continue giving her report.

"The family that accepted your request to send out a force was the fourth family, Jin Talon. His ability is strong in attacking, and he thought that it would be easy when using his power to try to help you find a Nest Crystal."

Quinn thought so as well. Exploding blood was one of the more difficult abilities Quinn had dealt with out of all of the leaders. There was another reason why Quinn was watching them all, and that was because he wanted to grant all the leaders with weapons.

They didn't have the habit of relying on beast or blood weapons, but it would increase their strength exponentially if they would start to use them. Right now, he was trying to figure out what type of weapon suited their respective abilities the most.

Carefully he watched their fighting styles, but there was something that he couldn't quite figure out that was bothering him a little.

"Some of the leaders' abilities I already know, but do you mind telling me all of their abilities? It would be in our best interest." Quinn asked.

"Of course. The first family possesses the ability to create an invisible force field around their body that can strike anything that comes within a certain range. The second family's ability is to reverse time on whatever they touch. The third family is able to produce Blood needles, stopping certain body parts from working properly. I know you have experienced this one yourself before.

"The fourth family has the ability to combust their own blood. The fifth family possesses the ability to communicate with any creature. The sixth family's ability is to set up invisible traps on the ground. The seventh family has the ability to harden an object, giving them the greatest defence.

"The eighth family used to have the ability of telepathy. Your own family possesses the ability of equivalent exchange.

"The eleventh family's ability is to get stronger with each hit. The twelfth family's ability is similar to the eleventh's, only that they gain extra speed for each successful hit. Finally, the thirteenth's family ability is string."

Out of all of those abilities, Quinn realised that one family, in particular, was missed out, and he was curious about something else as well.

"Bryce gave the order to disband the eighth family. I was wondering if there should still be vampires with that ability. Perhaps there should be a way to introduce them back. It is a good ability to have." Quinn wondered.

"There should still be plenty of vampires that have that ability, but they have been split between the other families. On top of that, the castle should have some information on that sadi ability, so if you wish to bring the eight family back, then feel free to do so. I don't think the leaders would object to this." Muka replied.

"And one more thing. You seem to have skipped the ninth family. What is your ability?" Quinn asked.

"My ability is always active. I believe that it is what allows me to stand by your side even now. The ability of luck." Muka answered.

"Luck? That can't be real, can it? How would that even work?" When asking this, Quinn was expecting Vincent to answer, but once again, he realised that the voice in his head was no more.

"I believe you will see it come to play at some point and time," Muka answered, and for the first time, Quinn heard a cheerful giggle. He noticed that the large armour and helmet she wore was what had deepened her voice.

Over the next few days, all the leaders had successfully learned how to utilise their Blood weapons and after observing them the King had put in a request for their weapons to be created. They weren't ready yet, but he feared that they could be running out of time.

The leaders would have probably learned it even faster if it wasn't for Fex's horrible explanation. Nonetheless, they had all succeeded in the end, and now they could pass on this knowledge to their own families as well.

'I guess it's time. Time to head back to the beast solar system, and give those damn Dalki a big surprise!' Quinn tensed his fists, and the veins on his head showed through as he thought about what they had done.

He was ready for some major payback!
