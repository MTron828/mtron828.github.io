Chapter 1112 - It's not easy

Of course a few hours after the announcement, and a few speeches wasn’t going to settle the hearts and minds of the restless. Nonetheless, Quinn and his group of people still had their own things that needed to be done.

Everyone, who was told to go to the blade island, was told to head to the ship docking area, where they would then take a medium sized ship with all of them on, and they would then head off to the Blade island together.​​

When Quinn had arrived, he didn’t expect for him, Eno, Brock and Mona to be the first ones there, while the others were still busy getting ready.

"It seems like the world is getting surprise after surprise." Mona said. "And assuming since you are related to him, you guys are part of this V group as well." She sighed and placed her hand on her head as if everything was giving her a headache.

"Honestly, with everything going on, aliens, beasts and super abilities, vampires existing in the world just isn’t too wild in my book. I’m just glad you’re on our side." Mona said with a smile.

Seeing Mona’s reaction had settled Quinn a bit. Of course he was worried about people’s opinion; it was hard for him not to be. Everything that he had managed to build up could have crumbled just then, and he had no idea if it was currently crumbling at the moment or not.

It seemed like the people who were in higher positions of power, those who had some type of control over their lives, were less afraid.

"This is what you wanted, right?" Quinn asked, looking at Eno. "You’ve been pushing for the world to know about vampires, so you must have an idea of what’s going to happen."

Looking back at Quinn, Eno’s face seemed quite surprised that he had asked this type of question.

"This is what I wanted? If it was, then I would have revealed to everyone that vampires existed a long time ago. Different situations require different solutions and it seemed like it was inevitable that something was going to occur.

"However, I must say that the reaction wasn’t not what I was expecting, but I still have many things to see until I make up my mind. Perhaps their reactions haven’t been so drastic because there is a common enemy, and remember the human’s aren’t the only ones that you need to worry about."

No matter how much Quinn hated Eno, he was right. One of the things that hadn’t been revealed to them all, was that there was a whole society of vampires on another planet, and some of them didn’t exactly want to get along with humanity.

For now, while they were preparing against Arthur, or debating with each other, things were okay, but if Bryce, or another vampire was to act, Quinn would need to step in.

’Will I have to take the role that Arthur gave up, the role of the Punisher?’ Quinn thought as he looked at his system title. Even though he was the tenth leader, he was also classed as the leader of the Punishers.

Soon everyone started to arrive together. Sil had come along with Shiro, and both of them seemed to be smiling. It made Quinn feel at peace. After all, he wasn’t sure if making Sil go to school at the time was a good thing, but now it seemed like he had made a new friend, outside Borden and himself.

Logan had entered along with little Borden on his shoulder. It looked like once in a while, Logan was still trying to find out a way of either prolonging Borden’s human-size fighting state, or making more of the solution from before.

In a way, if they could control the demon tier beast, there was a good chance that as long as the beast was still alive, Logan could continue to create a serum for Borden. Fex had wandered in on his own, which suited him in a way.

A person who got on well with everyone, but wasn’t particularly close enough with anyone to click with them. Then, the last two had arrived, Helen and Layla. Quinn didn’t know if it was a coincidence, or if the two had met up and decided to come together. The latter was very unlikely, especially with the way the two of them were looking at each other.

As they walked towards him, they were power walking, one person trying to get in front of the other.

"Do you really think you can win him over, because you two are similar." Helen said. The cat was out of the bag, and from the announcement, it was clear Layla was also the same as Quinn. Which meant in a way, she had one up on her.

’Are you sure bringing both of them along is a good idea?’ Vincent asked. ’The two of them are already butting heads and we haven’t even left yet.’

’A promise is a promise, and Layla actually far exceeded my expectations in that fight. How am I meant to say no to someone who tried that hard?’ Quinn said, looking at Layla still having the same fire in her eyes.

After seeing how she was so upset before, Quinn was a bit worried it would take her long to recover. Especially considering her subclass that was more emotional compared to others, but she was back up on her feat and more determined.

Shoving Layla off to the side, Helen had eventually won the barging match and now stood in front of Quinn.

"Quinn I realised that before I didn’t really show you how determined I was. Look, I’ve said how much I like you and I mean it, and I’m not the type to beg." Helen explained. "But if you really think for a second I care about you being a vampire, or that will change how I think, then you are wrong. You can turn people right, then turn me, turn me now." Helen said, as she pulled her shirt slightly and started to b.a.r.e her neck.

Quinn briefly looked round and could see that everyone was looking at him.

"Well she is feisty and might turn into something good, it might not be a bad idea." Eno suggested. "You will need a queen to tend to your needs someday."

"Look, it’s really not like that, besides we don’t turn people by biting them." Quinn nervously started to speak fast, trying to get all the information out at once. "You could also turn into something dangerous. You can’t eat your favourite foods..."

At that moment, one person had stood in-between the two of them, one and one no one had expected, and it was Fex. He lightly pushed Helen away.

"Do you think being a vampire is easy?" Fex asked. "This isn’t something that you should choose on a whim just because there is a boy you like. As much as we didn’t want to tell others, we are dangerous beings, and we can turn into monsters.

"I....I couldn’t do anything, I couldn’t control myself as my body called for blood, and then I killed one of my best friends. One of the leaders of the Cursed group. Even though I knew what I was doing, I could see everything I was doing and I couldn’t stop it.

"Being a vampire is not easy." Fex said.

The tension in the air was heavy after that, and it was a reminder to everyone there that being a vampire wasn’t a pleasant thing. There was a reason Quinn had called it the Cursed family in the first place.

The doors being heard open had broken the awkward moment in the room, and instead of embarrassing herself any further. Helen chose to just walk past everyone and head into the ship, as she waited for it to leave.

’What has gotten into you Helen, you have never acted like this before, is it because of that brat. I need to stop seeing this as a competition.’ She thought, as she began to cool her head down.

The one who entered was Sam.

"Before you guys go off, these are the other three people that will be joining you on your trip." Sam said.

"Bucky?!" Quinn called out.

"Can you at least remember my name?" Chucky replied.

After releasing the report to the whole world, and having two additional world messages being sent out, Oscar was sitting in his seat, shaking his head. He had deliberated when would be the best time, what would be the best thing to say, but in the end it looked like it still wasn’t good enough.

"Sir, I know you have multiple requests coming in about the V’s, and I have filtered those messages off to the side as you have requested. However there is a report about multiple Dalki being seen in a certain area." Jane reported as she scrolled through her tablet, and brought up the report in front of him.

"It seems like a group of Dalki have been spotted on an ex orange portal planet of ours." Jane reported. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

"Ex orange?"

"Yes. The second base at the time had sent out their students to do an expedition there. It turned out that there were advanced tier beasts and possibly more dangerous beasts on there, so the portals were changed to a red portal.

"Soon after our soldiers experienced an attack and decided to abandon the planet, but we still had some surveillance technology left on there. While one of the groups was going through it, they found that a small faction had taken base there."

If the Dalki had gotten on the planet it must have been through a different method compared to usual, and the fact that it had gone unnoticed. The main issue was the old orange portal planet was one of the planets that the human’s claimed to own, and it was in the middle of their other beast planets.

"Are there any humans on the planet?" Oscar asked.

"That’s the strange thing sir, it seems like the Dalki, they are protecting the shelter that has been built there. It looks like some survivors had decided to make it their base after they had survived. We are unable to confirm whether or not they are V’s or not. What would you like to do sir?’ Jane asked.

After thinking about it for a while, Oscar had made a choice, due to how close the planet was to the other forces, it was dangerous if they were to attack, they had to get rid of the Dalki.

"We will get rid of the Dalki, it’s time for the Earthborn to move." Oscar ordered
