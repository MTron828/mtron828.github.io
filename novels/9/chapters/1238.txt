Chapter 1239 Defeat?

Watching the fight so far, Graham had actually been paying close attention to everything that had been going on. He had a keen eye, and despite only having briefly seen the faces of the people on the livestream once, he had remembered them all.

'That person, they called him the Cursed faction leader. I was told to keep an eye on him, I never knew he was on that planet.' Graham thought. 'Earlier when the camera panned, he was just off by the sides, so why now of all times? Is it because his people are in trouble? No, if that was the case then he could have jumped in when the first lot did.'

His mind started to go through all the possible calculations, and eventually he turned his head to the Dalki that was in his container, now having died. He went over to the computer to check back what had occured. That's when he could see that moments before the Dalki's death, its brain waves were changing, almost becoming non-existent. This had all happened before the Dalki had lost its life.

"The words spoken and the Cursed faction leader joining the fight, on top of the Dalki switching over sides, this can't all be coincidence. Slicer‚Ä¶I'm afraid you might be in real trouble.'

Watching the fight, through the screen, Quinn had been able to gather a few things. The five spiked Dalki's speed was great. Nearly on its last legs, it was even more powerful than anything he had encountered and there was one part of it that could move faster than any other, its tail.

If it wasn't for Hilston having his armour, or teleportation ability he would have been caught by it a lot earlier in the fight. Having drained the energy from his original body a while ago, Quinn wasn't sure how strong his body would be when he returned, but he made use of the amulet's ability to allow him to drain those he had Marked.

To his surprise, when doing so not only did he get the one spiked now two spiked Dalki energy back, but the energy he had transferred to the Dalki as well, so Quinn was not only back in top shape, but was even better.

The only thing was, after having suffered a defeat, he knew he couldn't hold back. The active skill on the armour set, was to give him full speed so now he was on a timer, as such he activated his soul weapon, giving him unlimited access and full control over the shadow.

'Still, this isn't enough, I lost to that five spike and I saw how much Hilston struggled to hurt it. I need something else.'

Although, Quinn's armour was a high tier one, it was not strong enough to block any attacks coming from that tail. Its sharpness had already been proven by its ability to even cut through the Demon tier Armour, but there was one thing that could work.

Shadows appeared over Quinn's hand, and now he was wielding a long Katana like blade.

"A sword?! What the hell is Quinn doing bringing out a sword in a time like this?! Quinn isn't a master swordsman like Leo, so why would he use that in a serious fight?!" Fex complained.

"Maybe it isn't Quinn, and it's the other person." Sam suggested, but even if it was the real Quinn, he knew he wouldn't pull out a sword for no reason at all.

Slicer had mostly disregarded Quinn up until now, instead focusing towards what she perceived to be the most troublesome one, the young blonde haired boy who had defeated Hilston. She swung her fast tail at him and Borden and Sil were unable to react to it.

Sil had super speed, but if he was to move out of the way, Borden would likely be killed, with the rest following right after. Still, his hardening wasn't strong enough to block the tail, and yet a clang was heard as the tail struck against something.

Quinn could be seen there with the sword in his hand, he had blocked the attack.

"Sil, I'm going to need your help, and the help of the rest of your family over there. Just concentrate on the strongest attack you can produce, and leave the defense to me!" Quinn shouted, releasing a large wave of Qi.

The tail was pushed back but only a little bit, and soon he was being overpowered.

'So I guess that answers that question, a five spike is stronger than me, even when I use all of my Qi. I guess I can only rely on my shadow.' Quinn thought as a shadow was being used to block the tail.

Of course, Slicer didn't stop there and started to move her colossal tail, attacking multiple places, yet the boosted Quinn was able to match that speed and stop it with the sword slightly, moving back using his shadow as well.

"How! How are you able to stop my attack!" Slicer shouted with anger.

With Quinn's soul weapon he didn't have a limit on how much shadow he could use, but the shadow was still slower than Slicer's primary tail. However, with Nitro acceleration he could match up in speed, and use the sword to block the attack.

As for the sword itself, Quinn never thought it would be used in a situation like so, but thanks to Longblade, he had been given the sword that seemed useless but had one trait, that it was unbreakable.

The extra speed, Qi, his vampire strength, and the energy his Demon tier Amulet had allowed him to drain, all factored into him gaining enough power to slightly push back against Slicer's tail.

"Everyone!" Quinn shouted, continuing to block each attack with his sword. Although the blade could be held with one hand, he was holding it with two due to the sheer strength behind each attack. The tail was keeping the two of them at a distance from each other so he was unable to touch her with his gauntlets to drain her either.

"We might only get one chance at this, so attack with everything you got. We need to kill her! Right now, all of our planets are under attack! They think they can just walk over us, well I won't let them!" Quinn shouted, as he held the sword with only one hand. His muscles bulged.

He didn't know how much longer he could continue to block the attacks this way or at all, but he had to do something. Multiple shadow portals started to appear around the area where Slicer was at. At the same time, without her knowledge, consumed by the rage of not being able to defeat the opponent in front of her, a shadow was covering the sand and had now reached underneath her feet as well.

'It looks like Hilston did a number on your wings and I have to thank him for that!'

Now with the shadow portals open, Quinn ran back out of range of the tail. He placed the sword away, and started to run forward. He didn't have much time, as the active skill was running out, but now he had to rely on his body to avoid all of the tail strikes. Moving left, right, piles of sand were chucked up and that's when Slicer noticed something.

'My attacks, they have slowed down!'

It was the effect of the shadow path she was standing on that had covered the wide area in shadow. With this, Quinn could avoid the attacks more easily under the effects of his boost. He soon threw his red blood disks out into two of the shadow portals by his side, while running forward, and they all started to appear from the shadows that were scattered around Slicer.

'Kill, I have to kill the Dalki! I have to get stronger, to beat him!' Was running through Quinn's head, and a mist started to appear from his back. Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

'I shall help you with your desire.' The voice said, as another portal appeared from behind. It was the Boneclaw which was as large as the Dalki itself. With its giant claws, it had pierced Slicer back. The almost impenetrable skin had been penetrated with ease. She screamed out in pain and swung her colossal tail, hoping to cut the Boneclaw, once hit it had turned back into the black mist and disappeared once more, but the familiar had already done a number on her.

It also gave Quinn enough time to sprint forward, and with his two blood drills he was ready. Now, standing behind the five spiked Dalki, Borden, Raten and Vorden were ready to follow up the Boneclaw's attack.

Quinn thrusted both blood drills directly into the five spiked Dalki's chest. The blood continued to spin in place, attempting to pierce the skin, but it seemed impossible. However, Slicer soon felt another force, pushing her from behind.

Borden, Raten and Sil used their strength at the same time, hitting the Dalki from all sides, to prevent her from flying away. Still, they were unable to peirce the body, but the Qi had done a lot of internal damage. Moving out of the way, Quinn's nitro accelerate time was up.

"It's up to you." Quinn said, keeping his shadow ready just in case. It was an emergency measure, so that Quinn would be able to temporarily put Slicer in the Shadow lock, and keep her there hopefully long enough for everyone else to escape.

When Quinn moved though, it was to allow one last attack to go through. A lightning attack that was being made, by now the combination of the strongest ability users in existence. Sil, Pai and Vicky, had jumped up, and started to spin their bodies as the three of them had turned their bodies into gigantic lightning bolts.

Due to the three of them being together, they were able to create one giant lightning bolt strike. Slicer was far more injured than she had perceived as she had never felt this way before.

'I have to‚Ä¶get away.' It was the first time her instincts told her to flee instead of continuing a fight. Alas, she could see nothing but a bright light in front of her. Skimming her hand over her chest, she felt that her scales had been damaged a little.

'That black haired person‚Ä¶is dangerous' Was her last thought, as she was struck by the lightning bolt that had passed right through her. Sil, Pai, and Vicky were seen on the other side. Looking back only to see half of Slicer's body completely missing.

"They did it, they did it! They defeated the five spiked Dalki!" Bonny announced it to the whole world.

At the same time, Quinn heard a familiar ding sound.
