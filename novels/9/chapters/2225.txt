The newly landed vampires, accompanied by their leaders, had fanned out across the city, advancing like a relentless wave. Unbeknownst to them, this strategy proved to be unexpectedly effective. In his haste, Jim had inadvertently created a challenging situation for all involved.

The sheer number of vampire leaders attacking different locations simultaneously meant that Geo, Nock, and the two demon-tier beasts couldn't be everywhere at once.

Stretched thin, they did their best to support their allies while also contending with the vampires who had been on the planet for a few days and were now acclimating to the gravity.

Initially, the green blood's extra strength had mitigated the effects of gravity on the vampires, but their bodies were now naturally adapting, further enhancing their performance.

Nothing seemed to be going in Amra's favor, and their situation was about to worsen.

"Is that giant tower their castle?" Jim inquired, pointing at the looming structure. No one had an answer. The current force saw it as no threat since no one was emerging from it, nor were there any attacks originating from it.

"It truly is an eyesore, and I can only assume it houses their most important figures," Jim deduced. "We should get rid of it."

In every battle, Jim's strategy had been to minimize casualties by targeting the enemy's main base in the final moments. He would send in the weaker vampires first to create a survival-of-the-fittest scenario, breeding stronger vampires ready for war. Then, the second wave would be dispatched to deal with any remaining issues. As they advanced, he would personally go after the leaders. The only problem was that, this time, the second part of his plan hadn't unfolded as expected.

"Chris, destroy that tower," Jim commanded.

Obediently, Chris leaped into the air. As he did so, his body began to transform‚Äîgray fur sprouted from his arms, and his fingernails turned into lethal claws.

Similar to Jim's transformation, Chris wore flexible armor that could stretch to accommodate his size, though it was sleeveless to allow for the growth of his fur-covered arms. As his sideburns extended, he swung his arms, sending two massive claw marks slicing through the air toward the tower. However, the tower's incredible thickness meant that more than just two claw marks would be needed to bring it down.

Before the claw marks could hit the tower, a small figure with four golden arms leapt up. Swinging them out, the figure released a burst of white energy that collided with the claw marks.

For a moment, the two sets of energy pushed against one another before dissipating into energy particles in the air, unleashing a wave of explosive power. Fortunately, the power wave wasn't at ground level; otherwise, some vampires and Amra nearby would have been affected by the attack's force.

While still airborne and before falling, Geo used one arm to latch onto the tower's side. Halfway up the structure, he dangled, ready for his next move.

The tower's self-defense mechanism utilized the energy of the crystal, but the recent attack had been incredibly potent. Geo wasn't sure if the tower could withstand a few more of those assaults without collapsing.

"Just when things were getting bad enough, now they have to attack the tower as well," Geo thought, growing increasingly concerned.

"Throw one up!" Geo shouted.

From the base below, near the tower, the Amra launched two large black rocks‚Äîthe same kind they had previously hurled at the ships. Catching them, Geo glanced down to locate the origin of the attack and spotted his adversaries below.

His hands still glowing with power, he hurled the two rocks directly at them. Jim, noticing the flaming rocks hurtling toward him, didn't move. He knew he didn't need to, as Chris and Peter both leapt up and punched the rocks, shattering them into pieces that continued to rain down on the ground below.Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

The debris crashed into surrounding buildings and the street, but none struck Jim.

"So that's the one who threw the rock at the ship before and has been causing so much trouble. Both of you, take him out!" Jim commanded.

The two complied, albeit hesitantly, and set off toward the Amra. Conflicting thoughts swirled in their minds, as memories of Jim troubled them.

"Do you remember Jim always being like this?" Chris asked. "I know he's doing this for our sake‚Äîby stopping these aliens from summoning demons into our world‚Äîbut he seems to order us around a lot. I feel like in the past, he would fight side by side with us or take matters into his own hands."

Peter remained silent as they continued forward until they suddenly stopped, confronted by the golden Amra standing alone in the middle of the street.

"I will always protect Jim with my life, no matter what," Peter replied. "My life has long belonged to him, so whatever he asks, I will complete!"

Peter charged forward, his body transforming into its celestial form mid-rush. A tail-like appendage emerged from his head, while his body became covered in a strange red substance, save for his black hands.

He threw his fists with raw power, and Geo mirrored the action, thrusting out his transformed celestial arm. As they clashed, the energy sent out caused the nearest buildings, already close to collapsing, to crumble.

Fortunately, anticipating a fierce battle, Geo had instructed the others to evacuate the area.

The power behind the hit took both fighters by surprise, their eyes widening in shock at each other's strength and the familiar sensation of their energies.

Ignoring this, Peter continued his assault, swinging his other arm. Geo responded in kind, their punches meeting again. With no other option, Peter used the swift tail on his head, but Geo deflected the attack with another golden arm.

The sharp tail, which had effortlessly pierced regular Amra, couldn't penetrate Geo's limbs.

"I have more limbs to attack with!" Geo declared, using a free hand to deliver an uppercut that struck Peter squarely in the stomach. The blow lifted him off his feet, and a shockwave of power erupted behind him as the attack passed through his body.

"That looked like it hurt," Chris commented, contemplating whether he should intervene in the fight. Observing Geo, he couldn't fathom that he alone was the reason the vampire leaders had been unable to progress, so he remained on standby, expecting something else to occur.

Peter smiled as his feet landed back on the ground. "If you want to kill me, then you should have aimed for the head!" he taunted, planting his foot firmly and gathering his energy in one fist. Naturally, Peter was also accumulating Qi in addition to the celestial energy.

Simultaneously, he coiled his long head tail around his arm several times until it formed a sharp point at the end, and hurled it out.

Geo sensed the danger of this attack, and with all four arms, he created a cross-shaped block. This time, when struck, it was Geo's turn to be lifted off the ground, flung much farther than Peter had been. His body crashed into a building and continued to fly backward until he felt someone catch him from behind. The two skidded, lifting the ground beneath them but eventually stopping.

"Why do you do these things on your own?" Nock asked with a smile.

Looking through the broken building, Chris grinned. "I thought there would be more than just him, and Peter, did you really think it was smart revealing your weakness like that?" he questioned. "Now we just need to decide who goes after who."

The two Amra, blessed with Quinn's power and the strongest of their race, stood side by side. If they couldn't stop these two, then no one else could.

"They're strong; you should be careful," Geo warned, accepting Nock's help and examining his arms. The glow around them had faded, but it was slowly returning.

"That's why I didn't come on my own," Nock replied.

The figures of two beasts appeared behind them, prepared to push back with everything they had as well. The stage was set for an intense battle, as both sides readied themselves for a fierce showdown that would determine the fate of their worlds.
