Chapter 1078 - The feeling of red

When Bliss had left the tavern, the effects of whatever was stopping Erin from moving her body were still there for a few seconds. She looked down at her arm, and was tempted to take off the chain. Her hand hovered over it for a few seconds but quickly decided against it.

Waiting a short while, she eventually could move just like before, and of course, by now, the girl known as Bliss would have been long gone.

’Who was that crazy girl, should I believe everything she said?’ Erin thought. But she knew the name Talen, and that little passage she spoke or riddle, it didn’t sound like the best of things.’

Knowing that Bliss was out of reach, Erin looked at the ground where she was, and it was only then that she could see a giant circle that had been drawn underneath and inside that circle there were several patterns. The patterns were other shapes and objects inside the circle.

The floor was quite dusty and the circle itself just looked like it had been drawn, with someone wiping their finger against the dust. Whatever the case was, the circle definitely wasn’t there before when Erin came to sit down with the girl, she was sure of it.

’This looks like some creepy magic stuff, maybe she had it set up from the beginning.’ Erin said, touching her head, as if it was giving her a headache. ’I’m acting like what she said was true, but what if it is true? No, even if it is true she said that not all of her visions had come true, and decided my own fate. I don’t believe in that crap in the first place.’ Erin then walked out of the tavern, heading towards the colosseum.

She was wondering if she should have contacted Leo via the mask, but whatever danger there was, it had already come and gone. Instead, she would head to where he was, who knows if someone came to visit her, perhaps someone had come to visit him as well.

After the semifinal match had finished in the battle of the beasts, there was a break before the final event would happen, the last two contestants had even been placed in different rooms as they recovered. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As for Chris and the others, they too were taking a break as they waited for the final event to begin, and were in a break room inside the coliseum. The room had been created for Mona Bree, as the colosseum was one of her most favorite places to visit.

"Sir are we not going to do anything about the Blind swordsman?" One of the men asked. "It’s clear that is him after his display of skills. If our research is correct, he shouldn’t have the beast taming ability. He should be disqualified from this tournament."

Chris was relaxed and he couldn’t stop smiling since returning from the arena, every so often, once in a while he would laugh randomly as he was deep in his thoughts.

"Are you saying that a small cat isn’t a beast? Then what would you have me think it was? Even if he doesn’t have the beast taming ability the fact that he is able to control a beast means he is doing the same thing. Is he not?

"And whether he is using his own skills or the beast that is completely up to him and within the rules."

Although the other Pure members didn’t say it, they were wondering what Chris was thinking. Did it matter if it was against the rules or not, had he forgotten their real reason for coming here and supporting the event, it wasn’t to find a winner, or to see who was the strongest, but to bring those with high level beast taming abilities back with them.

However, none of them would say a thing to Chris, after all, he was rank 1, and there was only one person in the organization who could truly overthrow his order.

"Then answer me this, do you not think that man might run away if he finds out who we are?"

Chris scoffed at this thought-like the man was a fool.

"Do you really think it was a coincidence that the blind swordsman has come all the way here? No trust me he won’t run away. I’m sure he has plenty of questions to ask, and I have my own as well." Chris tapped the sheath of his strange-toothed weapons a few times as he said this.

"The two of us shall meet when I hand over the prize to him, he just doesn’t know that there will be one more opponent for him to face."

Meanwhile, in Leo’s resting room, away from the eyes of others, he had finally paced Ovin back into his own body, giving him time to rest.

’Ah that’s much better.’ Ovin said.

It was also the first time that Leo had felt a significant amount of his Qi energy being taken from him.

’Are they not able to consume Qi as well while they are out?’ Leo thought.

Sitting down, Leo concentrated to try to recover as much energy as he could. From what he had lost giving to Ovin. Now Ovin’s power had returned, he was sure that he could deal with the final competitor. However, one should never be contempt and Leo wanted himself to be at full strength as well, ready for anything.

Now that he had learned the third stage of Qi, Leo could extract small bits of Qi from the outside world. Sensing Qi not just from life and beasts, but in the air around them. Earth, unlike the other planets, seemed to have quite the bit of natural Qi flowing around.

Still, it was a difficult thing to do, and the amount that could be extracted was minimal. It felt like a straw had been strangled and Leo was trying to drink water from a pool with that said straw.

’That man from earlier, he purposely showed me his Qi, he knew straight away that I could use Qi in an instant, and he was able to hide it from me before. I can only assume that he is a member of Pure, and a high ranking one at that.

’He will be able to give me my answers.’ Leo thought.

———

The stage was set, and everyone was ready for the final match that was about to take place. Ovin was out once again and on top of Leo’s head, but he was slumped over more than he usually was.

’I know I recovered some energy, but fighting these guys is a bit of pain. I think it might be good if I didn’t use my full power.’ Ovin said.

However, Leo was ignoring the little black cat, and even his opponent, who stood opposite him. He didn’t even register that his opponent had a high-level Emperor tier beast with him, one that had black skin and even had what looked like beast armor on themselves. A humanoid type beast.

’Show me what you can do.’ Chris said, staring eerily back at Leo at the same time.

Everyone was at the edge of their seat, waiting to see what would happen next. They were excited to see the black cat pound all of its enemies in one hit, and a few from the crowd since Leo’s last display were recognizing who he was, still, they didn’t care. They had come here for entertainment purposes.

"Everyone, the final battle will now begin!" The announcer shouted.

At that exact time, something large fell from the sky. As it landed, the whole area shook and cracks in the ground had formed, splitting out, destroying even the seating area in the coliseum. When the dust finally settled, they could finally see the black-skinned humanoid beast.

However, it was just the tip of its head and that could be seen through the dust. With more of the dust moving down, they could now see that the beast’s head had been removed from its body and the figure that was holding onto the head itself.

"I am Dred! And I’m here to get rid of you all!" The Dalki smiled.

A Dalki had invaded the collusion, a place on earth, and a single one at that, but this event would send shockwaves through the whole human race, for it was a four-spiked Dalki.
