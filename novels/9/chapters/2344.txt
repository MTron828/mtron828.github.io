In the end, Muka could understand the Familiars' situation well. It was a problem that they had always been struggling with and trying to solve. They were somewhat in the middle of all of this, just because they needed a place to live.

What she found most interesting, though, was how much the Boneclaw believed in Quinn. Based on the story they told, they had decided to help Immortui because they were simply unable to go against him. However, knowing that there would be some sort of giant battle and knowing what Immortui was trying to do, they still thought that if Quinn was there, he would prevail.

"The Boneclaw has been by Quinn's side and actually believes in him that much. There had to be a reason, something the Boneclaw saw in him," Muka thought. "Although they say that the familiars are picky with their reason for picking a host, maybe that isn't true. They were just searching for people that could help them with the current situation they were in."

Despite all of this, there was still one overbearing problem that they needed to solve. Muka slowly turned her head toward Peter. She was unsure what type of expression she was pulling right now because she was extremely worried but didn't want to show the worry on her face.

"What would happen if they realize this is the fake Quinn... I mean Quinn is actually alive and well. So it shouldn't be a problem if we tell them the truth, right? Yeah, the truth is the best thing after all," Muka reassured herself.

"I see!" Peter said with a smile on his face and both hands on his hips. "In simple terms, you have decided to help Quinn again. If that's the case, then we have no problem at all. You are free to help as you wish."

The four kings turned to look at each other and nodded. It seemed like they had somewhat already agreed on this beforehand.

"Very well, but remember the deal. You are to help us in our situation. The Undead king has already used up a lot of energy trying to transport the familiars over, which means he is no longer in the position to do something like that.

"However, we will need what energy we have to help you in your battle. Once that task is done, you must find a way to bring us to your world. This is a verbal agreement and will be part of our contract."

Before anyone could say anything else, a strange large symbol had appeared in front of the four kings. Muka recognized it because it was the same symbol that the vampires would draw when trying to summon the familiars and create a contract.

Usually, there was a need for a drop of blood, but in this case, they were already in the familiar world, so there was no need. Muka wanted to burst out, telling the four kings to wait because she could already see what was going to happen.

However, all four of the four kings had turned into balls of energy and went right through into Peter's body, disappearing on the spot. Soon after, markings had appeared, four of them on all different parts of his body.

It was clear to Muka what just happened. Her mouth was left wide open, and her hand lifted toward her forehead as if she wanted to slap it.

"The four kings... just like they did with Erin, they wanted to make a contract with Quinn. They wanted to help him with his fight against Immortui, but now they have attached themselves to Peter."

It was too late to say anything now, and the four kings themselves realized the issue.

"What are you saying!" Ovin shouted. "Are you saying this is not Quinn? This is not the same feeling you got before?"

Ovin was shouting at the Boneclaw, which was communicating in grunts and such.

"Wait, we formed a contract. We are connected to this person," Genbu said. "This person, he looks the same as the one that I met. How can it not be the same person?"

The Boneclaw was insistent that this was not the same person. Now connected to Peter, he could feel the energy. While still in the familiar world, all of the markings on Peter started to light up, and the Four Kings appeared in front of him again.

"Explain yourself!" Ovin said, his head nearly full of flames, ready to attack at any moment. "You are not Quinn! You tricked us, you fooled us! Who are you? If you don't answer, then we will just have to kill you to break this contract."

The smile returned to Peter's face as he punched his fist into the palm of his hand.

"Oh, you guys do want to fight!"

"Wait, I can explain!" Muka darted in front of the two of them. "You are correct, this is not Quinn, but this is one of his closest friends. Just as you stated, Immortui has already begun to act. Quinn has currently gone to try and deal with him.

"In the meantime, he left Peter in charge to do his duties. That is why he looks like him. We were never meant to trick you. We were just protecting the settlement on Quinn's orders, and the one you believe in is very much alive!"

After saying all of that, Muka had to take in a deep breath. She had said it in one sentence, trying to get her words out as quickly as possible before a fight started, and it seemed to work, as the Four Kings had calmed down.

"In a panic to save our planet, we have been too hasty lately. We have jumped to conclusions too many times, and now we have a huge dilemma," Ovin stated. "Even if we were to kill our host, who knows how long it would take us to reform? By then, the entire familiar world could be destroyed, and we would never form again."

"This person, they must be quite strong," Genbu said. "Perhaps all isn't bad. After all, he is able to contain all four of us. That is not something that just anyone can do. And if Quinn entrusted him with such a great task, there has to be a reason."

"Maybe you guys don't recognize me because I am disguised as Quinn, but I have met with you before," Peter said as he used his ability to cancel his transformation for a short while. They did remember Peter because he was indeed strong.

On top of that, the Boneclaw grunted a few things to them.

"Is that true... I see if that's the case, then maybe us being attached to him won't be a complete waste. The only thing we can say now is if you wish to use us to help Quinn, you must stay by his side," Ovin said.

Peter smiled once more.

"That's good with me. It was what I was planning to do anyway, and what I always will do."

In a bizarre way, this whole alteration had led to Peter obtaining all four of the Four Kings to himself. How useful they would be in battle was hard to say, and only time would tell, but at least it was one less problem for them to worry about.

That was until something clicked in Muka's head. She thought everything was over, but there was something that was nagging her, something that was said in the story.REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

"Before, did you say the Undead king has the power to teleport not just to our world but to the other world as well?" Muka asked.

"Yes," Ovin replied, raising an eyebrow. He could tell that the vampire was worried about something, but he had no clue what. For him, he considered himself the smarter one out of all of the kings, so it was bugging him a little.

"So, are you telling me that the Undead king has the power to transport us to the world where Immortui is?"
