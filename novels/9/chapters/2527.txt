Chapter 2528 ¬†Just an old book

The group wasted no time as they moved closer to where Immortui and Unzoku were. They intended to use Sil's power but wanted to get closer to minimize Sil's energy consumption. This way, when Sil did use his powers, he could position himself perfectly next to the Red Heart and Unzoku rather than somewhere in the general vicinity.

This gave Quinn a little time to check out what was unlocked in his system now that he was in his demon form. The first thing he noticed while running around was a new flow of energy in the air.

It was an energy he couldn't see with his eyes before, but now he could discern it. It was where all the blood was being split, and he could feel its source. It resembled strands leading him to the right place.

Not only that, but just like before, the strands were flowing into him. The blood energy naturally moved toward him effortles sly, requiring no concentration on his part. It was drawn to him.

[Absolute Shadow Control]

[Absolute Blood Control]

His absolute blood control and shadow control worked in the same way. He could control both powers freely, creating whatever he wanted from them, condensing them into different attacks, and more.

This was a positive development. When Quinn transformed into the bloodsucker, he couldn't use his blood powers. However, in his demon form, he could still use his powers as he was accustomed to.

One more line of text appeared:

[Shadow Blood will be infused in all blood and shadow skills]

'Shadow Blood, that's the ability I created by fusing the two together. Does it mean when using my blood aura and shadow abilities, it will have the same double hit effect? But what use is it on the shadow, which is mainly for blocking?'

He was wondering if they were now the same thing or different, or perhaps it was more to do with the way he used each power, since they did work in slightly different ways.

With blood control, Quinn knew that he could use his powers as usual, but they would be stronger compared to before. He wanted to know if there was something special, and it seemed like there were a few things.

[Shadow Blood Rain]

[An attack that comes from the wings. Small bullets of blood will shoot out from the wings as if it were raining. Each hit on the enemy will gradually slow the enemy bit by bit.]

'This attack is a bit like the Shadow Blood Bullet, but instead of one bullet at a time, it will rain them down like a machine gun. The question is, will this have an effect against Immortui? The blood fists were unable to do anything, and with his Colorless ability, will this type of attack even get through?'

[Shadow Blood Screech] Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

[From the mouth, a wave will expand out. The attack will start out narrow and grow in size. Depending on how close the move is used, the effectiveness of the attack will increase. The attack will dull all senses of your opponent.]

'This is also similar to the other shadow power I used before. With opponents I have gone against so far, they seem to be able to block the shadow with their power, even the demon aura and red mist power seem to, to some degree. Now that my blood has evolved, this attack might be my main ace in the hole.'

At least, that was what Quinn thought until he saw the final skill, and to be honest, he didn't know what to make of it or what its power would be.

[Shadow Blood Weapons Creation]

[The user will use its own blood mixed with its shadow powers to create weapons of his imagination. The weapons created are a condensed form of both shadow and blood. They are infused with great power and almost indestructible.]

Quinn wasn't much of a user of weapons; he mostly used his gauntlets. But since the power came from his blood, maybe he could create some on his hands. There had been times in fights where he had used other weapons such as spears and shields.

He had used swords but did so in a creative way.

'So from this, I can assume that the creations from my actual blood are far stronger than what I can do with blood control and shadow control. I have to remember that it will have the same effect as well as the Shadow Blood.'

To be honest, Quinn didn't really know what to make of all these abilities, and it was hard for him to think since he hadn't had time to test them. Either way, he was sure just like he had done with his fights so far, he could create his own moves as well.

At the end of the day, the system was there just to help and guide him.

'Vincent, Richard, I thank both of you for creating the system and allowing it to take me this far. Originally, when I first got it, I thought it was a curse. I would have done anything to get rid of such a thing.

'At times, I always thought that maybe I could have done more if I did this and that differently, but I realize that's not the case. The truth is, sometimes I think, what would have happened if I had never opened that book?

'What would have happened if I never had cut my thumb on my glasses back then and had gotten these powers? How much different would the world be now? Who would have thought all of this would have come from just an old book?' Quinn smiled.
