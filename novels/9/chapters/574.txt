Chapter 575 The seventh blood ritual

On the new land, a landscape that could be seen once one climbed halfway up the mountain. Blip was seen huffing and panting, he was on his knees gasping for air, covered with wounds and his wings wholly scorched.

In front of him was the long-awaited crystal they had been fighting for. Depending on what type of beast it was, most of their bodies would remain until the land naturally decomposed them. Although they seemed to deteriorate quickly once the crystal had been extracted.

The beast they had been fighting was an elemental type. Once they were beaten, their body would cease to exist, leaving just the crystal in its place and that crystal was the very thing Blip was looking at now.

It should have been a joyous occasion for them all, he should have been smiling. It wasn’t every day, one would get an Emporer tier beast crystal. Even he had only ever faced one before this one, but he couldn’t celebrate.

How could he, when on this mission, one of his people had died. Lying on the floor, Mitchell was there, his glasses broken, and an inconsolable sobbing was coming from Megan. Nate had made it out alive, but he too felt like he couldn’t celebrate.

This was his first time taking on an emperor tier beast, and he didn’t wish to do it again anytime soon.

"The others." Blip said. "I need to know what happened to the others?"

"Linda was with them, right?" Nate said. "There shouldn’t be a problem then." In Nate’s head, he was also thinking that because Quinn was there as well. They definitely shouldn’t have had any problems dealing with two king tiers. He would have taken that over one emperor tier any day. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"No, the other beast, it wasn’t a king tier but an emperor tier as well!" Nate replied. "Hello, Linda, Linda, reply!" But there was no answer. Changing the frequency, he started to speak out to all teams.

"Please, give an update on the current situation," Blip asked desperately.

Nate had never seen him like this. Even when fighting the emperor tier, he seemed calm, uncaring, but now he was more panicked than ever. He was a man who cared about his sister more than anything.

"Report coming in." A voice was heard. "The teams are already returning back to the shelter, as ordered by Linda. She has remained behind with a few of the others. We don’t know what happened to her."

"You abandoned her!" Blip shouted. He opened his mouth and was ready to curse at them all for leaving her behind, but Nate had placed his hand on his shoulder.

"Look what happened to us," Nate replied. "They wouldn’t have been able to do anything."

Hearing something reasonable from someone who was usually very unreasonable allowed Blip to think a lot clearer. In the end, it was the best decision to make, to save the most amount of lives possible.

This was a tragic day for them. Blip couldn’t imagine how many people they might have lost today.

"We have to go help them." Blip said, standing on his two feet, he soldiered on through the pain, even though one of his legs was badly injured.

"What are you crazy!" Megan shouted. "We barely survived this, and you want us to go fight another emperor tier beast?" Once again, she started to break down, looking at Mitchell’s body.

"When does it stop!" She cried. "Why can’t it go back to how the Crow’s used to be."

Blip had no answer for Megan’s cries and just remained silent. He knew what she meant. The Graylash family put a tremendous amount of pressure on their faction to deliver the crystals. Threatening and blackmailing them. Now they were more reliant than ever for their protection, and they used that to their advantage.

It caused a rush in their actions. If they were the old Crow’s, they wouldn’t have tried facing such a beast until they were ready, or maybe they would have even spent more time doing research. A mistake in grading a tier beast wouldn’t have happened.

No one was at fault, they were all pushed too much to do their jobs.

"You guys head back to the base. Take Mitchell’s body." Blip said. "You have done enough for today."

"Are you going?" Nate asked.

"Of course, she’s my sister. I need to at least try saving her." Blip replied.

"I’m going with you. I have someone I want to see is okay as well." Due to Nate’s ability out of all of them, he had actually come out the battle the least damaged. If worse came to worst and Linda was already dead, then Nate could carry the body out and back to the shelter.

He was also now even more worried. If they had struggled against an emperor tier this much, then what about the others? Even with Quinn, the Blood Evolver, he would find it a struggle.

’Sam, I hope you weren’t one of the ones that stayed behind.’

Back in area four, Quinn had placed a bit of his Sylvia on Linda’s wound inside the cave. It helped the healing process a little, but the cut was quite deep, and he needed to act fast.

Blood from his hand was drawn, and he dropped it into Linda’s mouth.

"I don’t know how much of this you’ll be able to hear Linda, but I’m saying this now all for yours and Sam’s sake." Quinn started to explain.

His knees were on top of Linda’s hand’s as her body started to struggle. The turning process was always a tough one, but for her, if she moved about while having a wound this bad, it might possibly kill her before the process was complete. So Quinn applied pressure with both his hands while staying on top of her.

"You might be wondering how I have two powers, or you might have wondered, and now you have your answer. The truth is I don’t have two abilities and only have one, the shadow ability. As for the red aura, that is something that all of us can do.

"That’s right, I’m making a differentiation between you and us because we are different. Judging from our conversation, you might have heard the word thrown about a few times already, but we are vampires. No, it’s not a joke, and some days I really wish it was.

"We feast on human blood to survive, we see better in the dark, and we are more powerful than your average human. You saw what we could do today. And we’re not the only ones out there.

"We have a set of rules that the vampires must follow, and one of these rules is that no human must know about us. Linda, today if I wished to save your life I had no choice but to turn you."

At this point, Linda was screaming in pain as her body felt it was on fire. She could feel everything changing inside. Fortunately, the wound on her neck had nearly completely gone. It looked like soon the process would be over.

"For you, Sam, you have a choice. I will not force you to become one of us. You heard us talking before, but there is something we can do for you and you only." Quinn paused before giving the option, as memories of doing this once didn’t really go down well.

"We can remove all of your memories. I don’t know how you will act. Maybe you’ll try to find out the truth, but you wouldn’t have to live your life no longer being human. If we just remove his memories, it’s unlikely they will find out, right Kazz?" Quinn asked hoping she would agree. He wanted to at least give Sam an option.

"I will allow it, but if he finds out again, or starts digging around on his own, then I will have to put a stop to it. Remember he also has that busy body of a friend of his."

Sam thought about it for a while. But instead of thinking of all the negatives, of no longer being human and having to consume blood, Sam could only think of the positives in all of this.

Sure, Quinn had only told him briefly what it was like to be a vampire. Maybe Sam didn’t really understand how the changes would impact his life. But was the one he currently had really worth holding onto?

’Nate, you keep getting further and further ahead of me. Maybe one day, you’ll be too far for me to reach you.’ Sam thought. If he didn’t do something, then everyone would leave him behind.

"Quinn, you don’t have to worry," Sam replied. "I have made up my mind."

At that moment, an almighty yell had come from underneath Quinn. A surge of power could be felt under his knees. He quickly jumped off and stood back.

"No, don’t tell me she’s another banshee. I can’t go through with that again." Fex replied.

The screaming had ended, it wasn’t as loud and piercing as before, which ruled a banshee out of the equation, the question was, what had Linda become?
