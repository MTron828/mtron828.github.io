Chapter 2520 ¬†All The Demon King's Blood

The Demon King Unzoku was at his strongest he had ever been. Over the time he had spent in the red space, he was one of the Demon Kings who was obsessed with growing his power.

The creation of the pit, making stronger inhabitants so he could feast on them, never ceased because his hunger never stopped either. Now, after eating one of the other Demon Kings, he had grown in strength by another leap.

He was confident that he wouldn't lose to anyone, and yet, if he consumed the werewolf in front of him, he was sure he would grow even more. The red mist around him was unsettled as he thought about all of these things.

'Crap!' Chris tightened his fist and didn't dare look away from Unzoku. The moment he did, he felt like the Demon King would pounce on him. 'We've managed to achieve the goal, but it's useless if we can't get the blood to Quinn. How are we going to survive this whole thing?'

Chris had only had a few interactions with Unzoku, which made it even more frightening. His strength was still far below Unzoku's. It was only thanks to his superior speed that he was able to survive so far. And it was only thanks to Shinto that they had gotten the blood revealed Unzoku's teeth almost instantly went away along with the glow in his eyes.

they needed as well.

Chris had decided the best thing for him to do right now was to react, so he was waiting for Unzoku to make the next move.

The red space was swirling around him, but it was doing so in a strange way. It was creating a type of whirlpool in the air right next to his ear. Then out of the red whirlpool, a mouth appeared.

It was red in colour, made out of the mist's energy. It stretched out, reaching Unzoku, and started to whisper away. The smile that revealed Unzoku's teeth almost instantly went away along with the glow in his eyes.

Instead of being in a leaning forward position like he was ready to strike at any moment, he then stood up with his back straight. The red mist disappeared along with the lips as well as the heavy tension that filled the air.

"It looks like my calling has come, and I have bigger things to deal with. Whether you guys survive what is about to happen is down to you," Unozku said, as if the words were directed toward the champions and Chris.

The Demon King soon bent his legs, and he leapt up in the air, disappearing out of sight. Moments later, the whole area shook forcefully. They couldn't see him land, but they could feel his power even now.

"What‚Ä¶ just happened? Did Unzoku just leave like that?" Calva said, somewhat relieved. He had already counted his last moments at least ten times during the fight, and now he felt great relief.

"I don't understand it myself," Chris said to the others. "But‚Ä¶ it looks like we managed to survive."

Chris transformed back into his human self. His body was exhausted in more ways than one. Although he gained newfound strength and stamina through eating Shinto, everything that happened was exhausting on his mind, and his Qi didn't get replenished either. He had used next to everything he had. He still had the strength of his body to rely on, though, if they were needed. What they needed to do was take this chance and get out of here.

"It looks like you had quite the fight here!" A voice shouted out.

The champions turned, along with Chris, and they were surprised to see that a reunion was occurring. Russ, Peter, Hikel, and Edvard were making their way over. However, Edvard was coming from a different direction compared to the others; he had come from the Yak city. He had been watching the fight so far, but he fully knew he was unable to do anything with the state his body was in. So Edvard just stayed back, getting close as he could, waiting for the result, the outcome of it all.

"It seems that you ran into quite a bit of trouble," Edvard said, looking at Hikel's arms.

"It also looks like you can barely stand yourself," Hikel replied. "I guess this was a bit too much for us, but we managed to do our best."

"We helped where we could, old friend; that's what we always try to do," Edvard smiled and pulled out the flask. He had the blood of the Yak king in his possession.

"What happened to Luce?" Pultra asked.

"We had some unexpected help," Hikel replied. "But Luce is no longer alive, so we don't have to worry about him anymore. We had already given Quinn the blood, though. What about you? What about the other champions?"

Their heads sunk into their chests for a moment when the question was asked, but Chris decided to speak up.

"Shinto gave his life, and in turn, we managed to get the blood of Unzoku. He's still alive, but he left this area for some reason. There is one thing that I'm not so sure about, though, whether or not this will count as two of the Demon King's blood."

"Two?" Peter replied. Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

The situation was explained as to what had occurred. They understood Chris' reasoning and his worry, but there was nothing they could do about it now.

"We can't worry about that werewolf," Peter said. "If we have all of the Demon blood, then we need to get it over to Quinn now. The energy I could feel on the planet before, I can't feel it now, and it's worrying me a little."

The entire group knew what Peter was talking about; it would be impossible not to. Because every single living thing on the planet could feel it. There was even a tingling sensation in their bodies, as the blood was trying to pull them to where Quinn was currently, but it had all stopped.

"Agreed, let's get this blood to Quinn and finish off Immortui!" Hikel exclaimed.

There was a confident nod on all of their faces, unaware of what had actually happened. Just before they set off, all of them could feel a rumbling beneath the ground as well. It wasn't short; it was a consistent sense of rumbling.

When looking up in the sky, they could see the large ships covered in a strange black hardened material, crafted by the Demon Yaks, rising in the air. Not only were they rising in the air from the production facility but also from the Yak city, where the other demons had joined and landed.

Fights were still taking place as the ships moved, but as if determined or forced by some sort of will, they were all moving in the air, and they were heading in a certain direction.

"That's the same area where we were training Quinn as well... What is happening right now?" Pultra wondered.
