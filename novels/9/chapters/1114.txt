Chapter 1115 - The Tour of Blade

Leaving the sandy beach meant that Mona would have to leave her new beast that she had just tamed behind. She did a few tests with it, and called it up onto the land. This was when they realised the sheer size of the beast, as a giant shadow had been cast all over them.

The water had made it look a little smaller than they had all imagined.​​

However, it was clear to Mona and the rest, although it could stay out of the water, it couldn’t move as fast nor did it look too well. The good news was, it meant that she could transport it and bring it along with her, but unless it is in the water it would be difficult to actually use it for combat purposes.

So in the end for now, Mona would leave it in the water, while keeping the connection with it. According to Mona, she could give it simple commands and although no words were communicated with the beast, she could tell how it was feeling. When giving commands, these feelings would be passed on and she generally knew what it wanted to communicate.

Now walking through the forest, most of them couldn’t stop talking about Mona’s actions against the beast.

"I can’t believe I got to see one of the big four fights." Hana said. "She’s an inspiration to us girls everywhere. I knew there had to be a reason beyond her ability. She was the only girl that was accepted into the big four."

"I always thought she would be more like a...like a witch." Chucky couldn’t help but say. He hated to admit it, but he had judged a book by its cover.

’Those skills she used, they had nothing to do with her ability. She actually fought and swung, diving in against that beast on her own.’ Layla thought. ’I hope maybe one day people can look up to me like that. I wonder if Quinn likes those types of girls.’

"Come on, if it was me, I would have just tied the beast’s limbs up, piece of cake." Fex commented, while pulling back his hair, that had gotten a little wet in the fight.

"I could have blasted it with my thorns exploding them on impact, I wouldn’t have had to even get close to the beast." Helen said as well.

"Ah yes, but then you two would have killed it, wouldn’t you? But now I get to use it as I wish to help me by my side." Mona replied, hearing everything as they continued to walk through the jungle.

Eventually they started to come to a point in the jungle, where there were pathways leading to different areas, and they now had to choose where exactly to go.

"Whoa, is that a castle, it’s like those really old style ones." Shiro said as he pointed towards the top of the hill it was based on. "Wait, Sil is from this place, right? So is this where you grew up?"

Sil didn’t answer, of course he didn’t because they weren’t exactly pleasant memories that he had of this place, and Shiro noticing this now felt kind of bad. After all, they had only come to this place because the Blade’s currently weren’t here, and he had been told they weren’t the best of people.

"Quinn." Sil finally said, as he lifted up his head. "Do you mind if we look around the place, see if there is anything before we head to the tablet. I just want to check if there is anything?"

"I assure you, I checked out the whole island before you got here. I even went to the large tablet where the dragon seems to be remaining." Brock said.

Even with that answer, it seemed like Sil wasn’t satisfied.

"I think it will be okay." Quinn said. "After all, it doesn’t look like the Dalki are here, maybe we jumped the gun, but I don’t think a couple of hours looking around will hurt us. If it does, well then it just means we would be in an even worse situation fighting the Dalki and the Demon tier beast."

After hearing this, Sil’s face lit up, and everyone else seemed to be fine with looking around the island. They were in no rush to face the Demon tier beast.

The first place that the group decided to stop at, due to it being close, was the Temple. It seemed to be still partly destroyed from when Vorden and Peter had fought here, against the others.

"What is this place, it looks like some type of school, and a fight broke out or something?" Helen said, as she looked at the giant hole through one of the doors.

"As you all know, the temple is no longer in use." Brock explained like he was some type of tour guide to the rest of them. "During my time here I witnessed everything that went on with the Blade island, those that were children of the Blade would learn their abilities and be sent here for training.

"Then when they had trained for long enough, they were faced against each other in a battle royal, until only one survived. The last one remaining, would be allowed to enter the castle."

Everyone was stunned by Brock words and how they were spoken so casually as if he was talking about a movie, but then realising that he was telling the truth, and noticing the blood marks in certain places they were devastated. They couldn’t help but look at Sil in a different way.

"I can’t run away from my past, it’s okay, I need to be reminded, let him continue on." Sil said.

"Wait, so all those kids with the same ability as Sil, are you saying they came from here?" Chucky asked.

"Yeah, that’s right. Actually the one that wanted to save them all no matter what, was Vorden." Quinn said. "And that’s why were going to get him back."

Although some didn’t know who Vorden was or what they were talking about, it seemed like a s.e.n.s.i.t.i.v.e matter so they chose to avoid it. They didn’t stay at the temple long, so the next place they went along to was the Castle.

As they entered they looked around at how grand and vast the whole place was. It seemed impossible for just a single family to live in such a huge place.

"As you are aware this is the Blade castle, where the main family members resided. I was under disguise as the head butler here, and was in charge of all the Blade servants that would work here."

As they continued to follow Brock, he had eventually taken them down to the dungeon, but it wasn’t a typical dungeon. It was more of a large empty space, with hundreds of metal spikes that were dug into the floor.

"What...is this place?" Layla said as she looked in horror, all around her. It looked like a room that was designed for torture.

"This Is what the Blade refers to as the chained. If you can’t guess, this is where they would chain up those ability users they thought were useful to them. Not only top abilities but unique original ones as well.

"Since the Blades could only copy so many abilities at once, they wished to overcome that weakness somehow, and this was what they had found. Still this was a temporary measure. It always seems like Hilston was searching for more, but he never did explain what it was." Brock continued.

"You mean, even you don’t know why he did all this?" Quinn asked.

"Yes, I have no idea. Why he had created so many children with his own DNA, hoping to look for someone stronger than himself. It made no sense to me, and it was almost as if he was beyond obsessed.

"When Sil eventually appeared, that obsession died down a little, and instead he chose to go after Sil. I’m afraid, no matter where Sil is, eventually Hilston will try to find him."

If this was the case, then Quinn needed to be ready for him. As they were to leave the dungeon, Mona stayed there for a few seconds. Her family members had also spent some time down there, and she couldn’t imagine how they must have felt.

’I hope you’re still alive, and I promise I’ll pay back that man for what he did.’ Mona thought as she went out of the dungeon with the rest.

The last place left to visit in the castle was the throne room. Here they could see a large dining table. Sil remembered this table well, as it was where the family at all times had to eat together, pretending to be happy.

At the side of the room, at the very back, there seemed to be different pieces of a mannequin. One that just had a c.h.e.s.t, others just a leg and so on, of every part of the human.

"What’s all this?" Fex asked, as he picked the mannequin that only resembled the c.h.e.s.t of a human, which fell over instantly onto the floor. He quickly picked it up, just in case it was something important, and just gave a cheeky smile at the others.

"That was what was used to display Hilston’s Demon tier beast armour. He had managed to make a full set of it, from multiple crystals and at one point, had one of the best forgers in the world create it for him.

"That was until he had killed the forger shortly after, making it so no one else could create a set just like it."

"A set of demon tier armour?" Mona replied, thinking she had misheard. "You mean it isn’t just a random demon tier beast equipment placed together, but an entire set? Did he come across a group of Demon tier beasts or something?"

"I don’t know the full details, as I wasn’t with him, but it was the most hurt I had ever seen Hilston before, and even his old Demon tier equipment seemed to be quite damaged." Brock replied.

At that moment, everyones body started to shiver as a natural response. Just how strong was Hislton, and was what Brock saying true? Back then, Hilston was never able to activate the Demon tier equipment he had used against Arthur, but what if he had? Would it have been a different story?

"Come on, we can’t be that scared, Quinn and the other leaders managed to defeat him after all, you guys can just gather up and beat him again." Mona said, in a half joking way just to calm herself down.

"We weren’t the one that beat him.." Quinn replied. "It was an old friend of mine...."

’A friend, I didn’t hear of this, did he die, judging from how Quinn is speaking of him.’ Mona thought.

Come, let’s go to the tablet if there is nothing else here." Said Quinn.
