The spaceship still had some thrusters that were working, but it wasn't going to stay in the air much longer as it hurled towards the ground. There was no way to repair the ship while they were on the ship, leaving them with little choice left.

"Everyone, get ready to jump out!" Dzai ordered.

The others weren't too sure about this, but they would follow the orders of their chief. When they were around ten metres from the ground, each one of them leapt off. Dzai landed fine on his knees and with one arm on the ground.

He looked up and soon caught Jessica who was falling and safely put her down. As for the others, some landed but had to roll, others butchered their landing and their bodies just slammed on the ground, but all of them survived.

They were strong vampires after all, the ship continued onward, crashing a few hundred metres from where they were, it exploded and now only smoke could be seen.

"We're in the worst possible place." Dzai said, looking around.

There was next to nothing around them, apart from the tall blades of grass. There was no sign of a city either, they were in the middle of a large field out in the open, there was nowhere for them to hide.

Soon, the small black ship, that was more designed for speed rather than transport, landed a little over twenty metres away, and the vampire that had been chasing them had a large smirk on his face as he jumped down.

"It looks like to me you're stranded." Magnus said. "As you can see, I have a ship here behind me, and you have someone you wish to transport. So all you have to do is beat me, don't worry about the pilot inside."

Magnus' finger started to glow red, and the top of the ship opened up. A red laser went straight out from his finger, it was a blood bullet, and it went right through the pilot. His head sank onto the front of the ship as blood spilled out.

"Who are these people!" One of the Vampire Corps members said. "They are willing to kill their own just like that, what type of group are you working for?"

This question was directed at Jessica, even though she was wondering the same thing. The member in the ship, also had a Vampire Corps uniform, another one that had died, all to get to her.

"Stop!" Jessica shouted. "It's me you want, right! I'll go with you, just leave these guys alone, I'll go with you." REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

She had fallen to her knees, practically screaming those words out, her throat hurt a little due to those screams, and the other members looked at the situation in confusion.

"Ah‚Ä¶ a very noble sacrifice, something the vampires need more of these days." Magnus said, as he continued to walk forward.

When he had taken a few steps though, Dzai lifted his sword. The edge was glowing red with aura, swinging it down, a giant red line of blood aura came out from the weapon. It was thick and went at least 30 metres high.

Magnus had no choice but to encase both of his hands in blood aura and push them both forward, hitting the blood swipe.

It pushed him across the ground as he gritted his teeth and tried his best to push back.

"AHHHH!" The marking on his head started to glow, and a surge of power beginning from his elbows pulsed out to his hands, hitting the large blood aura swipe and destroying it.

'I‚Ä¶ an original, had to borrow power to stop that attack? I thought the new generation of vampires was getting weaker, then what is this, who is this?'

Magnus started to sniff the air, trying to use his nose. There was something different about this vampire, the smell, it was one that he hadn't recognized during his time.

"Jessica Clark is our prisoner." Dzai commented. "She will be coming with us, and I will successfully transport her, no matter what."

The frustration could be seen, clear as day, on Magnus's face, but for Jessica, it was painful. Why was another member of the Vampire Corps sticking up for her so much, when she had already decided it was best for her to just give in.

Magnus ran forward. He was no longer calm like he was before. His hands were still shaped like claws, and before reaching Dzai, he threw them out. Rings of blood went out right towards Dzai who used the large great sword to block them all.

Each time the attacks hit, large clangs would be heard. Magnus had landed right by Dzai's side, his finger nails pierced through the armour of his body and sent out a blood pulse, but he wasn't hit away like Magnus had thought. Instead, one of his hands had grabbed onto Magnus, keeping him in place.

He tried to pull back, to pull it away, but it wouldn't budge.

'What type of strength does he have, this is beyond that of a vampire.'

"You‚Ä¶ you're not a vampire!" Magnus said, the realisation had hit.

The large sword was hovering above his head, and with that strength he would be sliced in half. Making a desperate move, Magnus purposely broke the bones in his forearm, allowing him to drop to one knee.

With his other hand free he placed it on the floor. In doing so, the ground started to light up, and now Dzai was frozen in place.

"Magnus' ability, he can create traps and if any one steps in those zones, they can't move! Usually the time isn't so long when others use the ability, but Magnus‚Ä¶ he's an original!"

An entire second, that was how long Magnus's traps lasted, and in a fight between high speed vampires and such, it was a deadly amount of time. It gave Magnus enough time to store up enough energy to create a blood cannon in his free arm.

Throwing it forward, all of the energy burst out right in the centre of Dzai's arm, it ripped a hole through the centre and this time, his body was sent off, hurling in the distance.

"Chief!" The Vampire Corps members shouted.

They were running forward in anger, with their weapons drawn, wishing to do anything they could to help.

"No! Stop, don't fight!" Jessica screamed. She tried to get up on her feet, and get in the way of the others, but she stumbled on the ground.

"Just because I'm having a hard time with him, doesn't mean you background characters can interfere!" Magnus unleashed a blood swipe, breaking through the beast weapon that one of them was holding and slicing one of the Vampire Corps members in half.

Another had reached him, but Magnus was far faster than him, slamming his fist into his head, crushing the skull and killing him on the spot. With two more blood swipes reaching the neck of the other members, they had fallen to the ground as well, leaving only one left from the transportation squad.

"Do you know why it's so easy for me to take your lives!" Magnus said, as he ran over and knocked the Vampire Corps members hands away, breaking them and grabbed the top of his head lifting him.

"Because, if it wasn't for me, one of the Originals, you wouldn't even be here in the first place, the fact that you are here, you should be thanking me, so how dare you even raise a hand in front of me!"

While one hand held up the Vampire Corps member, the other was burning with blood aura, to the point where it looked like flames. He went to reach out and move it, but it was stuck once again.

Looking at his hand, he could see red strings attached to it.

"Strings‚Ä¶ this ability!"

Holding out his hand, it was none other than Dzai, more strings wrapped around Magnus, and with great strength he pulled him away. Magnus was up in the air. Covering his body in his aura he started to cut all of the strings and safely landed away from Dzai.

Jessica looked at Dzai, who no longer had a mask on his face, it had broken in the attack, and under the mask, it was someone she never thought she would have seen.

"I told you Jessica, if you needed help that I would be there." Dzai said, but Dzai was not the name she knew him as.

"With the power of my father's string abaility, and the strength my mother gave me, I, a Colossal Dragaur, will do everything in my power to get rid of you!"
