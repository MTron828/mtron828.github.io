Chapter 1868 Battle on Rein

Out in the middle of the vast ocean on Earth, a gigantic beam of white light suddenly hit the sea. It had caused gigantic waves to be pushed for hundreds and hundreds of miles. From a distance, it looked like someone had chucked a giant rock into a pound and ripples were being pushed out of it.

Eventually though, the giant white light started to fade. The power that it was emitting started to go away, and now falling through the sky, Quinn can see the sea in front of them.

Quinn was moving his hands about rapidly as he could see the dark blue sea coming closer and closer to him.

"That damned god didn't even give me time to prepare myself. If I meet him again, I'm going to drown him in this water!" Quinn shouted.

"Drown him?" Sil replied, casually just falling through the air. "I don't think that would be possible with a god that is based on a fish. Wait, can fish drown? I'm sure they can't?"

While in the middle of his thoughts, Sil summoned his soul weapon and had selected a few abilities that would help him in the situation. He came to a halt midway in the air and quickly flew over and caught Ceril.

"Thanks." Ceril replied. "But I would have been fine going into the water. Our bodies automatically transform when they become wet."

"Oh, so does that mean you want me to drop you then?" Sil asked.

Quickly, Ceril shook her head. Looking around and just from the smell of the water alone, she could tell this wasn't her planet. She was in a completely different place than before. Going into the sea, it felt a bit invasive for her.

Panicking, Quinn had continued to fall. He then saw that Sil was flying, to which he decided to activate his demon tier equipment. He was able to save himself a few inches away from the sea.

'Damn, I think I just embarrassed myself a little. If I had just thought about it, I could have activated the wings in the first place. Some day, I'm going to have to get over my fear of the water.'

There looked to be no land nearby. And because of that, Sil slowly descended and created a little ice platform for them to stand on. It was a square sharp about the side of an average house. Looking around, none of them knew where they were. It was hard to tell just by seeing the sea.

However, there was something else Quinn could use and had been meaning to use it for the longest time. Closing his eyes, he went to sense their energy. Before Quinn could only sense their energy if they were close by. At times, there were certain things that could get in the way of him finding the others.

Regardless of all these things, now Quinn could also rely on the dedicated follower celestial energy. He was searching out for his own energy amongst the planet and he had found it.

"There! This way!" Quinn said as he flew up and started moving. Sil quickly did the same as the three of them headed in an unknown location.

"What did you find!" Sil shouted.

"Peter‚Ä¶he's not too far away," Quinn replied back.

After the bright white light had disappeared, everyone was slowly getting back up on their feet. Some were quicker than others and Chris decided to take advantage of the situation. For the men that just came into the lab, Chris had a little trick.

He stomped his foot on the ground and trails of energy spreaded out from his foot, covering the entire floor. As they got up from the floor, a strange power was felt from underneath, entering their bodies.

Blood started pouring from their mouth, ears, and eyes. Nearly all of them had collapsed at that moment. Not only had they collapsed but around fifty or so of them were dead.

"What‚Ä¶was that, was that some type of Qi?" Lucia asked.

"Are you talking about the strange beam of light outside or what Chris just did?" Jessica replied back.

Honestly, Lucia wanted to know about both. She had trained her Qi up like many in the Graylash faction. Since nearly everyone used Qi, it had become the norm to add it to your abilities to power them more.

This though, it was on another level than what the others had seen. If she was to take a guess it looked like the third stage of Qi, but spread out far and wide across the ground. Something similar to Qi control, giving out a set of instructions to the Qi.F

"We did a good job destroying the lab, but there are still many places we have to get rid of. Let's head to the military base next!" Chris ordered. "There is a research lab there that focuses on the development of new weapons."

The group nodded and followed Chris closely behind. But as soon as they went through one set of steel doors to head back to the elevators, they realised that there was a problem straight in front of them.

"They..look so scary!" Minny pointed.

All of the twenty or so large cages that were filled with experimental humanoid beasts had broken. Most of them looked like dazed zombies, but as soon as they saw the group enter, many of them turned their heads.

"These guys are giving me the chills," Mitchell stated, as he began to activate his demon tier boots that he had received from fighting against the Chained. They started to glow blue and he was ready to leave at any second.

The group of humans closest had started to change. Their arms grew incredibly large, nearly twice the length and thickness of their own bodies, to the point where their bodies were lifted into the air while their giant arms were pressed against the ground.

At the same time, another group had transformed into a type of winged creature. A hideous face with multiple eyes and four sets of wings. One screamed towards them, firing off a sonic bomb straight at them, but Chris stood in the way.

The explosion hit his body, but there looked to be no harm done on his body at all. With a swipe of his arm, five marks went through the air and sliced them into multiple pieces that fell to the ground.

The strange giant armed creatures started to move, jumping with the power of their arms and raising them in the air ready to crush their enemies. A blood rifle was fired out hitting one of the creatures and causing half of its body to go missing.

Peter had leapt up in the air, punching one of the creatures, causing it to be sent back through the ship and creating a large hole. The others had joined in with lighting strikes and blood aura attacks to try and keep all of the creatures at bay.

"Don't attack too hard!" Chris shouted, as Peter. "If I really wanted to, I could destroy this whole ship. However, remember there are people on board that aren't involved in this. They are simply living here."

Peter had already made a couple of large holes in the ship from fighting. Holding back wasn't exactly his forte, but he would try his best while helping others. As he landed on his feet, a strange horse-like creature had crashed into him dragging him across the floor.VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

'All of the beast humans have different levels of strength. I see Pure would have been really difficult for others to deal with, but I'm not like others.' Peter cursed the antlers of the beast coming towards him and punched it on its head just hard enough to kill it on the spot.

Right now, he was wishing he had Laxmus's body by his side, but he hadn't been brought because he was afraid it would attract a bit too much attention in a place like this.

There were around two hundred beasts or so on board with different strengths and weaknesses. The group were finding it difficult to deal with them all, apart from Chris, who continued to kill everything with a swipe of his hand, slashing them into several pieces.

After a while, they had halved their numbers, but they had spent too long in the lab, as reinforcements had arrived. Pure members, holding onto their special Qi guns, were there.

Then rolling through, there was something else, a large Qi weapon, that had to be carried by two people. It was so heavy.

"Qi canon, watch out!" Chris shouted, as the end of the canon started to light up.
