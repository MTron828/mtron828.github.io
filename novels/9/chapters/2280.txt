*****

The whole city, the entire planet that Sil and H fought on, had practically been destroyed. Whatever large structures there were, they had been reduced to nothing but rubble.

It would be hard for one to believe that there was a civilization on the planet if they were to land on it now. Still, there were quite a few who had managed to survive, trapped under rubble, too far away from the fight to see but still feeling the energy that passed through the planet.

Hiding, waiting for it to stop, waiting for a result, and one had finally come. Sil was the victor, the one who fought on the side of the Mermerials, the Amra, and the Penswi. However, going against Pine and H back to back had come at a great cost.

For one, they had already lost nearly all forces on the planet prior to this one. When leaving it be, Pine had killed everyone on it, and on the current planet they were at, there was only a small token army of around 100, a mixed bag of races.

Then, there was the worst outcome of the battles‚Äîthe Mermerials had lost two members of their Royal family, Wince and Ceril. They had fought a hard battle, not giving up and eventually dying, fighting till the very end.

The news had yet to spread to the other planets. In fact, the fighting still went on elsewhere, as no one was aware of what was happening with each other, too focused on their fights.

Then, there were also the Blades that had lost their lives, sent to a far distant land for their survival, always fighting to try to change the image they had of the past, and in the end, still losing their lives to the one that caused them great trouble.

It was a sad fact that Sil had yet to come to terms with fully. He had done a lot to try to protect them and still failed. He was starting to understand how Quinn felt. At the very least, he wished to pray for them and give them a proper burial, but nearly all of their bodies in the area had already been burnt.

Still, there was a moment of relief for Sil, that everything was over, but that was all it was, a simple moment, as his eyes laid on the large figure in front of him. A species that he had never even seen before stood in the center, confident, holding the crystal that had come out from H's body.

"Sil," Layla called out, "Don't do anything rash."

She was now next to him, along with Minny. The two of them had run out when wishing to give the sword to Sil.

With how close she was, Sil had noticed that Layla broke out in a sweat and she was shaking. Minny had reacted as well, covering her body in a shadow and baring her fangs toward this person.

It was natural for Layla's body to react in such a way because she remembered everything about this person and their great power.

"I guess there are too many around us who are looking," Mundus said, and soon the air outside of the area they were in was still. There was almost no sound being made. Sil could tell something was different, but he didn't know quite what.

"I have to congratulate you because, thanks to you, you have managed to turn the tide of the war!" Mundus said, sounding quite excited. "But you should know that the battle isn't over yet. There is still more to be done. Nevertheless, you have already done so much. I have been watching you very... very carefully."

Sil was still trying to figure out if this person was an enemy or not, and whether he needed to use his powers or even if he could, since his MC cells had nearly depleted to the bottom of the barrel.

"Don't worry, I promised a certain someone that I wouldn't meddle in Earthling affairs, as long as everything works out in the end. And besides, the quickest way to end this war is still through you."

"It's just, I can't let there be any more troublesome ones coming from your planet, so I will be the one to take this." Mundus shook the crystal in his hand.

Sil wanted to keep the crystal in case he or someone else wanted to use it, but since he could see Layla's reaction, he thought it was best to just let this person do what they wanted. Sil himself realized that they had made a good point.

He still had the memory change ability. Even if the heads at the top and all the powerful opponents were eliminated, everyone would still know no better. In a way, if Sil had died in the battle, then everyone else would have suffered greatly in figuring out what to do.

"I have a warning for you," Mundus said, looking at Sil. "In the future, it's best that you stop your exploration. I don't know why you are doing such a thing, but you never know what can come about due to the result of your actions.

"Look at what happened here. They tried to push too far, and now they are paying for it. You Earthlings seem to be quite obsessed with protecting people, but another way of protecting people is to stay out of trouble."

Those words hit Sil harder than he thought. He had seen a future where great beings had attacked Earth, as well as one where all of the Blades died. He was unable to stop the Blades from dying, but what if the future was due to him trying to meddle in the first place?

It was something that he always had to try and live with and was why he never tried to look so far into the future.

The sound of the wind moving again entered Sil's ears. When he looked up, he noticed the being was gone. Both Layla and Minny were fine once more, now that the threat was gone.

They all stood there in silence for a bit, still stunned at everything that was happening, until they could hear an explosion go off in the distance. It started with one, but soon many more followed.

"What's happening?" Minny asked. "Isn't the fighting over?"

"No," Layla answered. "The fighting won't end with just that. Those fighting have lost the lives of those they care about, that were right next to them moments ago. They also have the old memories, and with it, the fighting will continue until then."

"Then we just have to change their memories again," Sil said. "I can put a stop to this war. Jack originally used me to change everyone's memories. So if I go back in that device, then I can use it to change everyone back."

It sounded a bit strange, after rescuing Sil, that they would have to go back to the place where they started, but it was the original plan.

"It will work. It will stop the fighting, not just here but everywhere, and they will all know the truth. How they deal with that after, that's down to them."

"Not to be a bearer of bad news, but I think there's one problem that you're forgetting about," Russ added. "There are no ships on this planet anymore. All of them were destroyed."

Teleporting to their side, another group of people appeared: Logan, Vicky, Jake, and Shiro. There was a lot Sil wanted to say to them, looking at them, but now wasn't the time for words.

"Jake and I will deal with the Dalki that are still on this planet," Shiro stated. "We aren't beaten from the fight. There is still a lot we can do."

"And I can make you a ship to get back up there," Logan stated. "We just need the materials, but once we're up there, we can end this war."
