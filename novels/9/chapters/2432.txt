In the destroyed Durum demon base, many of the Skullys that had been watching the fight between the demons, and were still there when Quinn had turned into a demon king had left the area. 

When they saw their chance, they bolted out of there. There were only a handful that stayed in the forest to watch. Those that felt like there was nothing left for them to go back to and felt like what they were about to see was the future of what was going to happen. 

In the very destroyed base itself, there was Quinn, the champion Calva, and the three Skullys. It had been a tense moment for them all, that was until they could feel a thick veil of red energy cover the entire area. 

It was thick and felt heavy, almost smothering them, making it hard to breathe. The strangest thing for them was that this energy, it wasn't coming from below, it wasn't coming from the sides, but was coming from above like a slow rainfall.

All of them looked up at the sky which had drastically changed in colour. There was always a red mist that was in the air, and staring through the clouds one could see space that was a slightly darker red, but the stars and planets could be seen still. 

It looked more like there was a type of red filter that was placed in front of them when looking at space. Making it only a little different from what they would experience from Earth's view. 

Right now, it was drastically changing. The space looked like it was swirling around, and thick colours of red were appearing slowly. An almost type of illusion was being created. The space itself looked to be forming something, something incredibly large. 

The giant red substance in the space was swirling around, continuously growing larger in size until it covered the whole sky. Not a single part of the space could be seen and now, just the thick red swirling red energy could be seen from above. 

"Immortui." Calva said. "He's here!"

Every cell in Calva's body was initiating a fight or flight response. They were shaking with explosive energy, and his skin felt prickly like it was being stabbed by a thousand needles. He and his body knew this was Immortui, he well remembered everything he had seen the last time he had met with Immortui, and his entrance was just the same as it was before.

"Immortui… this is Immortui!" Quinn was grinding his teeth out of concern. 

Now of all times to meet the enemy he was looking for. He was unable to transform into the demon form, he could hardly use any blood aura with the demon form taking nearly all of it, and his god-slayer armour was under repair. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

That left him with just his physical capabilities and his Shadow abilities. If Immortui was really the great being he was touted to be, then Quinn, the way he was right now, stood no chance against him. 

From the sky, the thick red substance was condensing together and spiralling towards the ground and it was heading right for the area they were in. Like a beam of energy, it hit the floor. A large shockwave rippled through the air. 

The wind from the shockwave was strong, it made them feel like they were in a tornado. As the power hit the forest to the side, the giant trees were uprooted from the ground and were being destroyed by the energy, turning them into nothing. 

Reaching out his hand to the side, Quinn opened up a shadow portal placing the three Skullys inside. 

"Stay put, if you want to live!" Quinn shouted. 

The three of them had disappeared and the action that Quinn had done didn't go unnoticed by Calva. 

The two of them looked ahead, and the energy from the space was condensing down to one point where it had hit the ground. A dust tornado looked to be concentrated on one point, while sparks of red would be seen through it at times. 

A shadowy figure could be seen as well, as more and more energy was coming from the space. Eventually, all of the red swirling energy in space disappeared, and it continued to flow down to the single point, then in an instant everything had stopped. 

The strong wind, the thick mist in the air, the shockwaves, now there was just a single person standing there.

'This is… is Immortui!' Quinn said in his head. 

Based on Quinn's first impressions he felt like this man was a lot more human than he thought. Especially compared to the demons he had seen. His skin was a dull grey all over but there wasn't much skin that could be seen on show. 

The appearance Immortui had was that of a young man, perhaps just about to reach his thirties. His face was incredibly clean with no facial hair, but his jaw, his nose, and cheekbones were all incredibly sharp and slightly sunken in. 

It was strange, based on the face alone, it was hard to say whether one would consider this person handsome, as there was something unsettling when one would just look at him. 

Perhaps it was Immortui's eyes. The white in a human eyeball, it was completely black, while the iris of the eye was red in colour with the pupil of the eye being white. Quinn had seen a large number of creatures and a large number of demons, but he had never seen eyes like this. 

They were deep, as if one was staring into space itself. From there, his hair, it was long and straight, swept back with half of it being white while the other half remained black.

The rest of Immortui's body, although it had a human shape, there was a strange armour that was fused with his body. It looked like armour, but it was swirling and moving around and it was moving with each breath he took as if it was alive. 

The armour was black on Immortui's body and it covered his legs completely but around the waist, just on top of the thighs, it almost looked like teeth had been engraved in the armour, and by his hips, there were two large red eyes. 

This was the main reason why Quinn felt it was hard to call it an armour, because the eyes on the black material by his hips were moving, clearly alive. Whether a part of Immortui's body or a living armour Quinn had no idea. 

The armour then continued up the side of Immortui, leaving his stomach and abs on display. It was only because of his body, chest, and face that he knew he had grey skin, because the rest of his body, including his arms, were covered with this strange material.

'This is it… this being in front of me, is the one that caused so much trouble for the Ancient Ones. The person that created the vampires, and the one that has caused so much trouble in my life. This person is Immortui, the person I need to kill!'
