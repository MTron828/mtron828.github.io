Chapter 1120 - A third body is needed

Naturally, Quinn had also wondered about the name of the mysterious ’being’ he had been talking to. With how boastful the voice had been earlier, it was actually quite surprising that he hadn’t introduced himself. However, the tone of the other’s voice after Quinn had introduced himself, had made it clear that the conversation between the two was over.

There had been no way for the others to hear what had just been going on. They had only seen Quinn place his hands on the tablet, it lighting up, and after a while he had let go.​​

Walking away, the dragon continued to survey Quinn with its eyes, but the vampire felt far less nervous. The voice in the tablet had seemingly kept his word and the dragon didn’t attack him.

The others could see how calm Quinn was walking over to where they were, so eventually they came out to meet him, worried that the dragon might suddenly change its mind.

"Quinn, are you okay? Did you hurt yourself when you fell from the dragon?" Layla asked immediately, and Helen soon stepped forward as well, but both of them were a little frozen in place, for they could see the large dragon’s head staring at their group. It didn’t do anything else, but the gaze was enough to tell them that it wanted them gone.

"I’m not hurt, you don’t have to worry about that, but there are a few things I need to explain." Quinn said and shared the details of the conversation that he just had with the person in the tablet. He didn’t leave out any details either, as he saw no need to. The group gave a few odd looks here and there, but they certainly didn’t think it was completely impossible.

Case in point the Demon tier beast, that was tolerating their conversation.

"Someone with so many abilities had to have been one of the strongest beings in existence. In history we never learnt of such a person." Logan stated. "If he really did have all those abilities, then what you are saying and what this person has done shouldn’t be too much of a surprise. However, the only thing I can’t understand is why did he choose to speak to you?"

Unfortunately, this was something that Quinn had no idea about, although he would have loved to know.

"We’ve managed to get to the stone tablet and grant Shiro the ability, so I would like to suggest that we listen to the ’being’ and leave the dragon where it is for now." Quinn said. "I don’t see any reason for him to lie to me. Honestly, with how powerful only one small part of the energy I absorbed from it was, I don’t wish to fight it. If we try to make it move, some of us might get seriously hurt or outright perish. Besides, since the Dalki know about this island, they might destroy everything on it trying to look for the beast, including the stone tablet."

"You’re really going to listen to some strange voice you heard in your head?" Eno asked as he stepped out of the trees. "You do understand the consequences of Jim getting his hand on the Dragon, right? He will be able to create even more Dalki, everlasting beings that could wipe out everything this whole universe has to offer!"

Taking one step too close to Quinn, the dragon moved slightly forward and now it’s large head was hovering over the Cursed faction leader. It was no longer looking at all of them as a group, but it’s yellow eyes were now directly staring at Eno, perceiving him as an intruder. It was so close to Quinn that he could feel the heat radiating from its large body from his back.

"Is he controlling it, like the same ability that Mona has?" Chucky wondered.

"That would make Quinn the first person to have more than one ability." Hana shouted back as if it was an obvious answer. "I, for one, believe he’s told us the truth this whole time! Why would he suddenly make up having talked to a being if he had the power to control it the whole time? That voice must have told the dragon to protect Quinn for now."

Still, despite the large dragon being behind Quinn’s back, it didn’t look like Eno was going to back down, or at least he wasn’t afraid. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"It looks like this is the second time today, that I will have to concede to you, but hear my warning, Quinn. Humanity’s sake is no longer just in my hands. Now you hold a large enough position of power that you will have to play your part in all of this as well." Eno pointed at Quinn.

"We still need to figure out some things." Quinn mentioned, with the dragon backing away. Sensing no more hostility from Eno he returned to his role as an annoyed observer. "Just as the voice said, the tablet is one of the most important things here, and if the Dalki come here we need to protect this place!"

"Eno, I was hoping that we could use your army to station a few here, so they could inform us whenever there will be trouble. We can try to build a teleporter, but that might not work. However the good thing is, the island is on earth, so any attack should be spotted before they come here giving us enough time."

Eno didn’t give Quinn an answer nor did he show any signs he was going to agree. He was a stubborn old man after all, but by now Quinn knew him long enough that he would at least do this much, especially since he would have an interest in keeping on the dragon at all costs.

"Can I request something?" Logan asked. "Since the dragon seems to be a bit tamer compared to before, do you think we can attempt to take some samples from it? I wish to use its blood to try and create more serums for little Borden."

"I mean I can try." Quinn thought, as he went back and placed his hands on the tablet once more. Unfortunately for some reason nothing had happened. The Tablet didn’t light up like last time, and he was starting to wonder if he had gone mad just seconds ago. Until...

[New quest received]

[Learn more of your past and return to this place once more]

[Learn of the Talen families history]

’Huh?’ Quinn thought the last thing he had expected was the system to give him some type of quest. After all, what did his family’s history have anything to do with the tablet?

"I guess we can try and see if something will work?" Quinn said nervously looking at the dragon.

"I don’t mind staying here for a couple of days, we can use the castle as a base." Shiro suggested. "And I can use that time to try to learn how to use this ability. It looks like it will be a while before I’ll be able to help out Sil anyway."

After much discussion, they had decided a few things. Eno had agreed that he would send a few of his ’own’ vampires here, and they would look after the place, keeping them updated on any changes to the island. In the meantime, Shiro would practice the use of his ability, at least sensing how to use it, since Eno was keeping a close eye on him and Sil.

Lastly, Logan was busy trying to extract a few samples from the dragon. Now that there was no longer a misunderstanding between them and the beast, Logan was able to extract a sample, directly from inside the Dragon’s mouth.

Of course, he hadn’t done it alone. Since it seemed to have been instructed to protect Quinn, or taken a liking to him, Logan had asked Quinn for his cooperation. The beast had turned out to be smart enough to understand that they wanted and after an annoyed puff of air through his nostrils he had opened its snout.

Quinn entered the dragon’s mouth first. When they saw it didn’t shut on him, Logan came over. This was one of the few areas that didn’t have its hard scales that seemed unbreakable, otherwise Logan would have never been able to get a sample.

Meanwhile, the rest had decided to rest inside the castle. They felt far more safe, staying away from the Demon tier beast. Heading over to the large canteen, Quinn had decided to pay Logan a visit, who was currently using it as a lab.

"I hope everything is going okay." Quinn asked. "Don’t worry once Eno comes here with his people, we can head back to the Cursed ship. I know there is only so much you can do here."

The frustration on Logan’s face was visible, because he had gained something that he had been looking for, for so long, yet none of the equipment to properly look at it, so he felt far more impatient compared to the others.

"If you’re not busy and have nothing to do, can you carry on with that request of mine from earlier? We need to keep looking, and hopefully by then Shiro will have mastered the ability somewhat." Quinn said.

"Are you planning to go behind Eno’s back then? If we find what you are looking for before moving the beast?" Logan asked.

"You have to remember, if this works the way I think it works, then Sil will still have all of his abilities in place." Quinn answered before he left to check up on how Shiro was doing.

While walking over there he did have a thought in his head about Shiro’s new ability.

’If Shiro is able to extract minds, or spirits whatever it is and place them into other bodies for Borden and Raten, does that mean something can be done for Vincent as well. It would be nice to get you out of my head.’

Vincent seemed silent about this request, because he honestly didn’t know how to feel. He had already made peace with the world and spending time watching over Quinn had been a p.l.e.a.s.u.r.e he couldn’t have imagined to get.

’It would be nice to speak to you person to person.’ Vincent replied.
