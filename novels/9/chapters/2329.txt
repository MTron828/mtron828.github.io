Quinn was flowing some of his own Qi into Galanar. He had to be careful not to use too much, but the force of power was helping his own little bit of energy he had in him, get to work as it repaired what was in his body. 

However, he couldn't take all the credit, as the Green Dalki blood did a lot of work, it re-energized the body for a few moments. Giving Quinn even more Qi to play around with, the combination of the two, allowed somewhat of a miracle to be performed and a few moments later there was no need for Quinn to do anything else, as he let his hand go from Galanar. 

"He is going to be okay, don't worry he won't die." Quinn said. 

It was hard to believe, seeing the state he was in before, but the wounds on his body were slowly starting to heal. 

"What did you do?" 

"I didn't do much." Quinn replied. "It was mostly thanks to the blood he bought. Its Dalki blood, something that's extremely rare to get now." 

With the Dalki, becoming essentially an extinct species. There wasn't the endless supply of blood there was before. Only what was left on the ships. It was sold around on the black market. 

Since it gave a great boost in recovery and strength as well for vampires, but as more of it was used, more would never come back again. So there were many that were just keeping the blood waiting for the price of it to rise. 

What wasn't taken into account though, with all of the black market deals going on, was the fact that there were different tiers of Dalki blood, and with Edvard and Hikel being the leaders during the war, they had the highest tier Dalki blood that hadn't been mixed or tainted. 

If it wasn't for this, maybe Galanar would have been added onto the list of those that had died, due to Immortui's meddling. 

Jessica was still very much concerned with Galanar as he was coming to, his eyes were flickering and it looked like he was starting to come around. While this was happening, Quinn walked away from the situation and looked at the other two. 

Somewhat naturally, both Hikel and Edvard walked to where Jessica was, and hurdled around him, this was all to block her view. 

Kneeling down, Quinn lifted one of the men off the ground, his eyes were glowing red. 

"How did you get that marking on your head?" Quinn asked. 

"It was from another vampire, he was strong and overpowered us all, forcing the marking on every one of us. He had long green hair." 

Although the vampire didn't state the name of who was behind this, it was clear the vampire that he was describing was Magnus. 

'Immortui is able to mark those that are close to death, we might have to keep an eye on Galanar and see if anything has happened to him, but at the same time. It looks like Magnus is strong enough of a dedicated follower that he can mark others as well. 

'They managed to get a whole squad in the Vampire Corps, is there anywhere we can go, where Jessica will be safe… but then how do we find Magnus?' 

"Tell me, where do you last see Ma-" Before Quinn could finish asking his question, the vampire started to foam at his mouth. His eyes lost sign of life and Quinn could no longer hear his heartbeat. 

He stood up, and could see that the same thing was happening to the others. Hearing the strange gurgling noise as if one was choking, Hikel and Edvard turned to look behind them. Immediately, they went off, running towards the direction they came from. 

"What's going on Bake!" Jessica asked. She could see how the other squad members were acting, and thought maybe this would happen to Galanar.

"The other members are all dead." Quinn answered. It was clear, it was a measure to stop them from leaking any information. Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Both Edvard and Hikel had come back, heading straight to where Quinn was. 

"They're all dead, all of them have died the same way." Edvard said. 

"This looks like the work of Magnus." Hikel added. "During the war, he was well known for reverting to tactics like this. He is most well versed in different types of poison as well. I found a bit of a dissolved capsule in the upper roof of one's mouth."

Hearing this, Quinn couldn't help but bite down. If they had knocked them out, and then searched for the capsule they could have saved them, but once again they had failed, just how many times were they going to fail.

Coughing could be heard from behind, and a bit of blood was spat out onto the ground, but it was a good sign. Galanar was the one who was coughing, and he looked to be conscious again, his heart beating strong. 

"Jessica… what are you doing here?" Galanar asked. 

She didn't say anything yet, but just hugged him tight. Right now, as he felt her breast push up against him, he couldn't have been happier. 

"Ah, this is good, all it took was for me to nearly die, for you to appreciate me." Galanar said. 

The others started to walk over, and Galanar could somewhat guess the situation. 

"Thank you all for saving me, I don't know where I am, but I remember what happened just before getting here." 

"If you could tell us in detail please.' Edvard asked. 

"I was in my apartment, when there was a knock at the door, it was early in the morning, so I ignored it for the most part, but they kept knocking so I opened the door, and I could feel someone whiz straight past me. 

"It was clear it was a vampire and a strong one at that. I went to fight him, but when I took a step forward, I was frozen in place. Something lit up right underneath me. I don't know much of what happened after that, I was knocked out. 

"I remember feeling a lot of pain after being hurt, hit, on the verge of death, and my hands." 

From Galanar's story, they learned a few things. One, the apartment being destroyed was set up on purpose, because there was no fight that had proceeded. They wanted them to try and find Galanar, and the second, was that it was Magnus who had done all of this. 

"Galanar, you weren't the only one that was attacked. Stacy and Gabe, both of them, they're dead… and I just couldn't lose you. I couldn't, that's why we came out here." Jessica explained. 

Galanar didn't know how to process his teammates being dead, he had nearly died himself, so it all felt surreal to him. 

"I guess I'm lucky that I had a captain that cares so much for me then huh?" Galanar joked, trying to lighten the mood and stood up. When he did he looked at the ones that had killed themselves. 

"Why… would Ryder do this? Why would he attack the Vampire Corps… and that other guy that attacked me. I don't see him here." Galanar commented. 

Jessica didn't want to say anything, but she did have a thought in her head, based on those letters that she had received. She felt like all of this was due to her. They had called her out. Ryder had come looking for her as well but when he spoke in his last moments, it sounded like someone else, someone else controlling him, trying to speak to her. 

'This feeling it's the same as before. I feel like when the dhampirs were after me. Why is it all happening all over again.' 

She looked at the back of the three in front of her, if it weren't for them, she probably would have lost Galanar and had to have put up quite the fight. Now she felt extremely guilty for not trusting them. 

The group continued out of the forest and was making their way to the vehicle they had arrived in hoping that it would still be there. They could finally see it, out of the forest and in the field up ahead. 

While out, Jessica continued to try to get through to the base on her communication device. 

"Restricted access, what is this, I've never seen this before." 

"You're trying to contact the base, let me see." Galanar said, going onto his device on his forearm. He could see that there was an emergency message sent out to all Vampire Corps members, and he pressed play. 

"This is an emergency message, the vampire capitan known as Jessica Clark, is the main suspect in the case involving Stacy Lue and Gabe Lue. If you see her, you are to bring her in at all costs. It is suspected that she is on the run." The message played. 

"What the…" Galanar said, ending the message there. "What is going on?"
