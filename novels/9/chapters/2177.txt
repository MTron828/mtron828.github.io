Most of the Blades were told to rest in the entertainment room or the dining room for the time being, while the rest of them gathered in one of the many large reception rooms that the manor had.

This was to stop the tensions and disputes from happening between Russ and the rest of the Blades. Shiro would simply relay the information to all of them afterwards. The ones that had gathered in the reception room sat on the hard surfaces that had been made.

The couches they were sitting on weren't soft and cushioned, instead they were sharp edged and had hard flat surfaces made of a type of shiny rock. A lot of the building was like this, made of sharp points, squares and rectangles, as it suited the Amra, especially since they had hard skin in the first place, but everyone else did find it a little uncomfortable. Regardless, now in the room together, the first thing Geo had done was apologise for hitting Russ.

The main issue he had was the fact that they were fighting in his library. It was one of the additions he had made since becoming leader, wishing to broaden his knowledge about various subjects.

Before, the Amra only had one goal: climbing the tower and growing stronger, but Geo wanted his people and himself to find interests and goals in other things. Which was why he was expanding his reading.

In his haste, he had panicked when the two were fighting, and decided to intervene and in turn Nock followed. In the end, the two of them had done more damage to the books than anyone else, when knocking them through the walls.

"So‚Ä¶ right now I feel like we are all quite confused." Shiro started the conversation. "We know why we are here, but why are you guys here, did you know we were here?"

It was the expected question and Layla out of everyone decided to do the explaining and when she did, she started right from the beginning‚Ä¶ the day when Quinn was meant to get an award, the day he went missing.

Layla, explained a little bit about the celestials and how they were keeping Quinn locked away and then explained her own journey as well. Shiro had figured out that this must have happened while they were fighting with Jack.

Because they were unaware of the event, and at the time they were the only ones that didn't turn up for the award ceremony, but soon Shiro was in for more shocks.

The fact that everyone had forgotten about them, the fact that everyone had forgotten about Quinn and Layla, that there was a power out there that allowed them to do that. She explained why Russ was with them as well.

That's when they needed to explain how they met up with Ceril, and what they had seen, and what Logan had shown them. After all of it, running away and travelling through the universe, they had picked up a few allies and continued to travel eventually ending up on the Amra planet.

A planet that Quinn had claimed to help out in the past, and was looking to ask for their help now.

"That's a lot to take in." Shiro replied. "I can't believe it, I can't believe all of that happened while we were away, while we were stuck here on this planet, and Sil." Shrio's fist was clenched and was bright red. He was squeezing it so hard.

"They're using him, using his power like he's some type of human battery! How could they do that!"

After calming down a bit, Shiro also had some more questions, and these were related to Quinn as to where he was now. They briefly explained the truth as they had no clue where he was, but were sure that he would return to the Mermerial planet safely and as quickly as he could.

"That's why we decided to get a head start. You said your name is Geo correct, and Shiro this goes to you as well." Layla said. "The enemies that Quinn has been facing, Jack and Jim, are going through the Universe, capturing planets and destroying race after race, enslaving them.

"They will soon be in this area as well, it's only a matter of time. Which is why, Quinn, as well as the other races, are asking that we work together this time, and fight against them. So I ask, do you wish to work with us?"

Geo and Shiro looked at each other at the same time, the answer was obvious and they had already decided a while ago.

"Of course we will help." They both said.

"The Amra will have to fight the enemy attackers and working together is better than working apart, it will be a pleasure to fight by the side of the Mermerials and the Penswi." Geo looked at both of them.

"And, no matter what, we need to get Sil back, and solve all of this‚Ä¶ we should come up with a strategy. They could come at any moment, and we need a plan to deal with them."

Layla agreed so the group decided to share their strengths there and then. After that, they also shared everything they knew about the enemy, and using all of the information they were forming the best plan they could think of at the time.

Shiro had his finger on his chin, and his head was quite exhausted after learning everything.

"The enemy is quite versatile. They have the vampires, and the originals on their side, which have strong abilities and they have the Dalki blood powering them. They are stronger than they were before.

"Then, there are the Dalki, their numbers seem to be quite large, and there is a mixture of those working by Jim's side as well as Jack's side, but according to the information we have, the ones that we should worry about are on Jack's side.

"Because with his power, he has managed to give the Dalki abilities. You have the humans and their abilities as well. The only good thing is that the Graylash family have decided to stay out of this, but Logan will be sending forces pretending to be on his side, maybe we can use this at some point.

"Still, there are the big threats that aren't on our side to deal with. The person called Ray, who had the power to match up against Quinn. Then there is H, the Dalki who defeated Sil.

"Chris is extremely powerful, and Peter is by his side as well. Currently, we don't know the strength of Jack and Jim, but they have to have something to stay in power. Otherwise everything would have fallen apart by now. The originals and the leaders have had their memories changed, like Muka as well. Honestly this is all a bit much, but that isn't even the biggest threat."

They all knew what Shiro meant when he said this, because there was something that could turn the tides.

"It's Sil." Russ said. "As long as they have that brat, then they can turn our allies against us."

"Although you are right, I don't think it will be that easy." Layla replied. "For one there are some of us that are unaffected by the memory change. There seems to be one mass factor when using the mass memory change as well.Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

"They can only change the memory of the person out with another. Because they are doing a mass change, they can't make it complicated as every person's memory is individualised. Think about it as well.

"Jim and Jack, don't know that Quinn has saved the Mermerials, or are working with the Penswi and the Amra, and they don't need to know. They will come here, attacking thinking they are taking over just any other planet.

"During the fight, we just have to do our best to help out. During the fight as well, that is when their guard will be down the most. There will be fewer to protect Sil. We can send a small quick team that can get in there and break Sil out. Once Sil is free, he can use his powers to turn everything against Jack and Jim. Saving Sil is the key to winning this battle."

The plan was being ironed out a bit more, and more allies were joining them. Meanwhile Quinn had two more god slayers he needed to beat to get what he believed he needed to win this war.
