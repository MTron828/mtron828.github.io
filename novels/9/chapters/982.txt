Chapter 983 - Noob fighter

The VR game Powerfighters also could copy one’s beast armour and weapon. Even though it was capable of doing that, Quinn really didn’t want any advantages when fighting. He thought the quickest way to improve was through failure and learning through one’s mistakes.

Luckily, there were no consequences for making mistakes in the VR game since it was just a game. However, even if he wanted to use his beast weapon, he really couldn’t. Taking his gauntlets out of his shadow equip, Quinn looked at his gauntlets, and they were in a sorry state.

Several dents in places, gashes of torn metal. Quinn imagined that if he didn’t have the shadow equip skill and he had to force the gauntlets on his arms, they would become a bloody mess from all the broken pieces hanging on it.

The durability was around that of ten percent, and all the boosted stats were ineffective.

’The Boneclaw’s attacks were really strong, stronger than any beast I’ve faced. I wonder if he would be considered a demon tier beast or something similar if he was one?’ Quinn started to think.

There was a feeling that the Boneclaw didn’t really show everything it had either during the fight.

Because of this, before entering the game, Quinn decided to go with Alex for a visit.

———

"Nooo!" Alex screamed with the gauntlets laid out on the table. "What did you do? Did you chuck these things into a blender! Do you know how long it took to make these for you!"

Whenever Alex would work on a piece of equipment, he worked extra hard personally on Quinn’s. It wasn’t that he didn’t equally put effort into everything he did make for the Cursed faction. It was just that Quinn would always be the first of its kind when making things, so it would take more time.

It was the first time he had to use fairy blood and the first time he had used king tier crystals with the gauntlets. He was already devastated when he had heard that his Emperor tier armour set was destroyed. Still, at least that had gone to good use, protecting Quinn’s life from the Demon tier crab.

"I told you, it was unexpected. You know me, I wouldn’t have let them get hurt on purpose." Quinn said. "Anyway, can you fix them?"

"Fix them," Alex said, slapping his head and still looking at the gauntlets on the table. "First, your gauntlets were made with specific beast crystals to give it the best active skill I could get. It would be quite hard to find those again, and honestly, creating a new pair would be easier than repairing the old ones."

Quinn thought about it for a while. It was time for him to have an upgrade in the first place.

"Do we have crystals to make a new weapon?" Quinn asked.

"Oh, I thought you said you talked to Logan before, didn’t he tell you?" Alex replied. "It turns out that the original planet that the Crows occupied is filled with strong beasts in the new land. So strong that Logan was unable to place his device to check out if there were demon tier beasts in the area.

"I know what you’re thinking. If you want a new weapon, then you at least want it to be at the legendary tier this time. Well, if you’re looking for plenty of high-level beasts with certain attributes, then that’s going to be your best bet."

Thinking about it, Quinn wanted another active elemental skill. The first advanced tier crystal gifted by Leo had the lightning elemental power, which gave him a great active skill, and the fire crystals after. It seemed like the elemental crystals gave him the best option in the end.

"I’ll think about what to get. I’ll ask Sam to send a team to the Crow’s planet, and when they find something, they can contact me." Quinn replied.

This way, he could be optimal with his time. Quinn wanted to fight the beasts himself. For one, legendary beasts were quite up the tier ladder, and there weren’t many in the Cursed faction that could deal with them. The other reason was Quinn wanted to see what skills the beast had, to see if it was suitable for making his weapon.

With his shadow skill, they just needed a shadow user.

’Maybe Wevil would be good to search the area.’ Quinn thought.

With the request sent off to Sam, it was finally time for Quinn to play the game. Entering his personal training room, he could see a pod there waiting for him. He had made this request so the others onboard also wouldn’t know what Quinn was doing.

Besides, his fame in the Cursed faction itself was growing and just walking around, he would get stopped several times, and his journey would be twice as long. Quinn didn’t want to be one of those people that didn’t reply back, and it was nice to get to know the people in the faction.

Although this Pod looked like any other VR pod, Quinn knew there was a difference. This one had been modded, added with the features that Quinn had requested from Logan.

’I remember entering the shop with Vorden and looking at the price tag of one of these things. I never thought I would own my own one. Now, there are several on the sh.i.p.s, and I even have a personal one made for me by the game’s creator. When I think about it, there have been some amazing things in my life.’ Quinn thought as he started to climb into the VR pod.

Just like when he had entered the other VR pods, the welcome screen appeared in front of him. Before though, after figuring out who the person was, the system would then log in Quinn to his user ID automatically and also use his traveller information, but not this time.

[Please enter your User ID]

’Ah, I really don’t care about it this time too much. Last time I tried to write something cool, and that’s never got me far,’ Quinn thought as he just typed in some words that he didn’t really give much thought to.

[Welcome Noob Fighter]

It had been a while, but after selecting his name, his body was chucked into the white space.

’I guess I can’t use the Bloodevolver appearance, can I?’ Quinn thought and started decorating and altering his avatar. Giving himself spiky green hair, and a plain gold and back tracksuit.

He looked like he was dressed as someone a 1000 years past his time, but he thought it suited him. In a world of no abilities, back in the past when people his age would have fought with their fists.

Checking out the game system, he could see that now there was also a limiter that had been set to fifty., Quinn could even lower this, so he could use more of his strength or increase it.

Before going into a match, he tested out the limiter for a while, practising what martial arts moves he knew, and it looked like it worked.

’You never fail to impress me, Logan.’

Finally, he was ready to start his first matchmaking session. As an A rank Traveller, Quinn would get matched up with those at a similar level to him, but for now, he would be put against some Rank B’s while the system was working out his correct ranking level, so the matchmaking would be fairer.

When Quinn’s body appeared, he could see himself standing opposite a man who was dressed entirely in black armour from head to toe and had a pair of small axes on his back.

"Noob fighter?" Chan read. "Is this my lucky day? I was on a losing streak."

Checking his opponent’s stats, he could see that Noob fighter hadn’t been in any fights, so he wasn’t quite sure if he was lucky or not.

’I guess it’s his first time playing, and I can take advantage of that.’

The match had begun, and Chan immediately threw out the small axe on his back towards Quinn.

Seeing it, Quinn decided to dodge the first axe as he was still trying to figure out what ability the person in front of him had. The next second another axe came towards him, and then several more were flying towards Quinn.

’Crap!’ Quinn thought as he started to run around the place and head towards his opponent.

"Hey, this noob is quite fast," Chan said, continuing to throw multiple axes from his back. Although he only had two on him, his ability allowed him to copy and produce the same beast weapon he last touched.

He continued to throw them towards his opponents, dn when the two got close, Quinn managed to duck a wild swing from Chun and hit him in the stomach.

The blow had done damage, but while falling, Chun picked up one of the axes that were stuck to the ground and dug it into Quinn’s foot. If he wanted to get out of this, he would have to forcefully rip his foot from the axe.

Picking up another Axe, Chun went to swing it towards his ribs again, but an elbow hit the side of the axe with such force, making it fall to the ground. While Chun was slightly stunned, Quinn went to punch him in the head again, but Chun quickly rolled, avoiding the hit and threw out an axe hitting Quinn’s other leg.

"I’m a rank B Traveller for a reason, don’t underestimate me!" Chun shouted. After a minute of intense fighting back and forth, a winner was eventually announced.

"Phew, that guy was tough for a noob. I’m surprised I won, his blows were so strong, and he was fast. I guess it had something to do with his ability? Wait, did he even use an ability?" Chun said, thinking about the fight.

Meanwhile, Quinn was back in the lobby and looking at his game screen.

"So my first fight was a loss, huh? Well, I guess setting it to thirty percent was too much to start with." Quinn said.
