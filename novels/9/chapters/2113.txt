The 8 spiked Dalki looked directly into Sil's eyes, and the scales looked to be reverting back into its body, revealing part of its face. There was light skin, and blue eyes could now be seen.

It was strange to say the least, because this isn't something that Dalki were capable of, the only one that could do something like this was Borden, and they never really had figured out the reason why he was different compared to the others.

Now that the full face could be seen, they understood why it was familiar, the face that was seen across many of their brothers, sisters, and fathers, it looked like them.

Just like Shiro before, now it was Sil whose body was completely shaken. His legs were vibrating, his hands couldn't keep still, and his lips were quivering.

'How can this be possible, no it can't be, it's impossible to be him. I killed him not just once, but killed him twice, even with the use of the second chance skill. I destroyed his head, there is no way he could have returned.' Sil thought.

"You seem to recognise me." The Dalki finally said, the one that was known as H. "I have a similar feeling when seeing you… but I'm not quite sure how to feel. Is it anger, happiness, pain? This feeling is annoying."

Whether this was Hilston or not, it didn't seem to quite be him, but Sil had to make sure, which was why he shouted out his name.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

"Hilston… are you still alive?" Sil asked, the rest of his clones were ready to move in at any second.

"My name is not Hilston, I am H." H, the Dalki, replied.

It was a confusing matter for Sil, and although he felt like he should attack, he was being cautious. His whole body was reacting to who this person could be, and there was a certain individual who was loving every second of this.

——

"Hahaha look at that, you were once so powerful, and now the Blade family can't even move. It truly is a shame that someone so great was able to be killed by someone like you!" Jack continued to laugh as he thought back about everything he went through, everything to create the being known as H.

After Jack had his whole faction practically wiped out by the Blade family, he was more than obsessed with revenge on them, but not just them, in particular on Hilston Blade himself, who had destroyed everything Jack had built up in an instant.

His whole life was destroyed and ruined because of these people, and it had become Jack's goal to get rid of them and Hilston. The thing was, due to certain circumstances, he was trapped, and it was only later that he had learned that Hilston had already been killed, and it was by another Blade no less.

His frustration, his grand plan of getting rid of a particular person was ruined. Therefore, he had decided to pass on all his anger and frustration to the one that killed him. It was still a Blade in his mind, and still someone that deserves to be punished.

Of course, during his journey he had met Jim, and a few others as well. He had learned there were quite a few amazing things that he could do with his power. The group hadn't always stayed far from Earth.

In fact it was the opposite, they wanted to stay in the loop of what was happening and find out everything they could. While Jim was gathering data and heading to certain places that Richard Eno used to be.

There was information that Jim felt he could use, and he certainly had found some. What was most surprising was that there was DNA of a particular person in question, of Hilston Blade.

It was strange to wonder why there was a file of Hilston's Blade DNA in the information but that wasn't what was important. DNA of special subjects had been used in the past to create a type of Super Dalki.

In one case, there was Helen, in others, the werewolf DNA that had been mixed with Graham as well. Since they knew the strength of Hilston before, creating a Dalki with his DNA, they thought it would become something impressive.

However, when the Dalki first appeared, it seemed strange. Since it was only the DNA, there were no memories of the past. It was a fresh Dalki, but the blood mixing with the Dalki didn't seem to gel too well, and in the end, the Dalki that was made had died, quicker than they had expected.

The process started again, as both Jim and Jack were determined to create something special, yet similar occurrences happen. On top of that, there seemed to be no special trait. The whole point of mixing a Dalki with powerful DNA was so the Dalki that was created would have a special trait.

Something that would make it stronger just like the other Dalki. Who knew, maybe some of Hilston's abilities would even pass on, although this was unlikely.

During their travels as a group though, they did manage to run into a couple, a strong blonde haired man and woman. They looked quite old but they were sure of it, they were Blades as well.

It was later found that these two were the mother and father of the others, but technically they were really older brothers, since all of them stemmed from Hilston in the first place.

Keeping them alive, a mix of all three DNA was being used, combined with the Dalki that was being created, and it started to have a stronger form, but yet again the lifespan of the Dalki seemed to be less then two weeks.

Jim thought they were being far too simple in their approach, and in the end, the actual bodies of the mother and father were used, as well as a Dalki, to create a hybrid along with the Hilston DNA.

Finally, they had created the Dalki which they had always been meaning to create. It was a powerful, stronger body than the others and was already born with six spikes from the get go.

Hilston was originally a strong human being, who had a strong sense of Qi, and there was this strange madness to him that made him powerful.

On top of that, there was even more to H. The transferring of abilities. Jack had the Blade power with him and placed it inside the Dalki, and just like the Blade's, H could also copy powers.

Since the basis of the Dalki was originally from Hilston, they named it project H and stuck with the name. Even though there were more of the other Blade's inside the Dalki. However, Jack didn't stop there.

During his journey and search for the Blade's he had come across one more that was powerful and for some reason travelling on their own. A younger Blade named Pai. It was a good test for H to go up against, and there was a clear winner in the end.

Although Pai was not wasted, as Jack took his ability from him before his death as well. The thing was, when taking the ability, Jack noticed something, that the ability, although feeling similar in his stomach to the others, it was slightly different.

When going next to H, he could feel the energy that was inside him, almost calling out to that which was in H, as if the two wanted to join.

What Jack didn't know was that the ability of Pai was different, because in the history of the Blade family, when Pai and his sister Vicky joined hands they could use their ability together, allowing them to hold Six abilities.

Listening to the power inside him, Jack had given this power to H, and now just like the two. H was not only a powerful and strong Dalki that was different compared to the others, it was one that had the power of the Blade's and the ability to hold 6 abilities.

"This… is over." Jack said looking at the screen in front of him of the situation down below.
