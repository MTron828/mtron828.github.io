Calva, one of the three champions that were said to have great power, power if combined together could perhaps topple Immortui was right now nervously standing in front of a demon. 

It wasn't just any demon though, the demon he was looking at was the great vampire Quinn. This demon was one that had defeated another demon king, making their strength extremely clear, but worst of all, unlike the other demon kings this one seemed to have lost his mind. 

'I knew it was too good to be true, I thought, that maybe someone had arrived that could do something.' Calva thought. 'Yet, he's gone mad, killing any Skully that moves. What's the point of getting rid of Immortui if something like this replaces him.' 

It was strange, the actions he had seen from this man, and him in his current demon form were far too different from each other. It was clear he no longer had the same consciousness, he was unable to control this form like the other demon kings.

'A problem like this has never occurred though, does this mean he's different, does his power not come from Immortui like the others? Maybe if there's a way to break him out of this madness.'

Calva had jumped from the forest and landed in the destroyed base. He hadn't moved since landing, and neither had the rest of the Skullys along with Anon and the others in the forest. 

They had figured out that movement meant their death. Still, Quinn had turned his head, and was looking at Calva with a smile, he was twisting and turning his head side to side, as if inspecting Calva and wondering what to do.

In a tense situation, Calva had to make a choice.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

"The demon king is dead!" Calva shouted. "There is no longer a threat to you, I will not attack you." 

Of course, if there were any signs of Quinn trying to attack him, Calva would fight with his life on the line, but he was trying his best not to use words that would set off the demon in front of him.

The champion Calva could feel sweat running from underneath his skull-like face, running across the side of his cheek, close to dropping on the floor. He couldn't even remember the last time he felt so nervous.

The first move was made by Quinn and immediately Calva reacted, as he created a large bone-like spear out of his forearm and held it in his hand. The other Skullys were able to create more of an exoskeleton but they weren't able to remove bone from their body like the champion could. 

When held in his hand though, Calva didn't throw the bone spear, that was because when Quinn moved he wasn't looking at him, he was looking directly at the ground.

Moments later, Calva could feel soft vibrations from under his feet. 

'No… is this, I've seen it once before.'

Calva immediately jumped up, and retreated back to the very edge of the forest,  standing on a large tree branch looking out, and that's when his fears were confirmed. He could see that Quinn had already used his wings to fly up in the air and still was looking down. 

Out from the hard ground below, red crystalised hands were seen breaking through the floor, and popping out of them were the Durum demons.  Their whole bodies were out on display.

"The Durum demons, in the first place, were demons created underground where there is no light. Their bodies crystalised allowing them to procreate without the need for another sex." Calva said to himself. 

Anon was surprised to hear this, he thought Calva didn't care, when Immortui originally came to attack, the Durum demons didn't exist. If he knew this information, then he had to be keeping track somehow, even while he was locked up.

Quinn up in the air, lifted his hands and red orbs of blood started to swirl in them. As the Durum climbed out of their holes, they were turning to look at the situation. 

"What is going on, Kronker's energy was sent to this place right!" The demons said. 

There were 1000's of small holes that were breaking from the ground everywhere, all over the place. The Durum demons were linked to their demon king after all, and when he had transformed a signal was sent out to all of the Demons. 

It wasn't sent out immediately, but only when Kronker felt like he was in trouble, and it wasn't a conscious decision either. It was a trait of Kronker, calling on those like him next to it when it felt like its life on the line, only the Demon kings worked on a far larger scale. 

Which was why all of the Durum demons had come to the current location.

"HAHAH!" Quinn continued to laugh like a man possessed and out from the swirling blood balls, a rain of blood bullets rained down towards the holes the demons had crawled out of. 

The blood ripped through their hard red crystals and they were falling like ants being soaked in water. Blood was splattering everywhere and it was starting to soak the floor. 

"What is going on, it's an enemy attack!" The Durums shouted. 

Pointing their hands, moving, they were firing crystals at Quinn. However, with the blood dripping from his wings, it started to act as an unconscious shield. Blood was swirling through the air all around him, and as it touched the red crystals it was turning them into nothing but dust.

"Even a whole army of demons isn't going to be enough to take him down." Calva figured. He held the spear in his hand once again, and decided to jump on the dangerous rain of blood. 

He jumped on the field once more and with one arm the bone extended out creating a type of shield above his head. As the blood hit the shield, it wasn't able to go through it. His bone was even harder than the red crystals that belonged to the Durum demons.

Then when in position, Calva threw out the spear right towards Quinn. Energy was surrounding the spear, and it broke right through the blood barrier. It looked like Quinn was ignoring the spear completely as he continued to slaughter the demons that continued to pop out from the ground. 

Without looking at the spear, he reached out with his right hand and grabbed it before it touched him.

'He was able to grab the spear at that speed. I thought his powers mainly focused on using the special blood powers of his… but does this mean he's physically improved as well?' Calva thought, and he was starting to think he had made a mistake. 

The swirling blood in his palms had stopped, and with the spear in his hand, Quinn looked at the champion.
