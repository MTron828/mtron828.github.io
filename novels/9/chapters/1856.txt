Chapter 1857: The legendary Blind swordsman. (Part 1)

Due to the methods that Silver and Leo used to communicate, it meant that at times their messages would take several days to arrive. Leo wasn't exactly going out searching for these vampires, they would just pass messages along to each other if they happened to meet.

Only this time, based on where Leo had been in the past, Silver had done well to guess where he would be next, and she was right, relaying the message personally to him. Because of this, it meant that there was little time left to act.

They needed to leave immediately and that was what they had done. Currently, the three of them were traveling via ship. It was sleek, fast, and quite cozy on the inside. The ship itself belonged to Silver, and she had used it to get to Earth.

Although teleporters still existed, there were restrictions at the moment. Since enemies, and more, were frequently using them to attack there were talks of a blanket ban on all of them. According to the latest news, Logan was trying to create a device that would intercept all of the teleporters in a certain area.

‚Äî I contacted the vampire soldier who is part of the current expansion plan. Of course, since Fex is the one that is leading this whole thing, it was easy for me to pull some strings. ‚Äî Silver explained.

‚Äî We will be meeting the vampires as bodyguards, although to the outside we will just be teachers. Both me and you have experience in that field, so it shouldn't be too hard to pull that off. Although I'm unsure about your large friend.

This was clearly a mockery of him, throughout the trip, Silver teased Chris, because she really did not know his past, nor why he was with Leo, and for her, he just kind of interfered with her time with Leo.

However, Chris didn't say anything, he didn't reply back at all and just continued to look outside of the window.

‚Äî Anyway. ‚Äî Silver continued.

‚Äî Please make note that these vampires will be nervous. They know what happened to the last lot. At the same time, there is a lot of uneasiness with humans in the first place as well. These vampires are committing to a brave task, just because Fex has asked them, telling them all it was what Quinn would have wanted.

‚Äî Quinn. ‚Äî Chris reapted. ‚Äî That young lad has become quite the hero, huh? It's strange how, at one point I thought the two of us were quite alike. Yet, look at how far he has come now... when did I go down the wrong path.

Hearing the tone in Chris's voice, Leo started to walk over to him. He sat down on the bench that was built into part of the ship, that had a long rectangular window to look at the sky outside.

‚Äî Worry, guilt, anxiousness, pain. I can hear that there are many mixed emotions in your voice, and see it in your aura. It hasn't settled down since we left the planet. On top of that you have been more silent than usual. Usually I can't get you to keep your mouth shut.

‚Äî You don't have to tell me what is wrong, but if your concern is about what others have done, well look at where Quinn is now, and look at where you are now. At the moment, I would say you are in a better position than him, you still have time to change things, to make your own history and set your own mark, where as for him, it's impossible now.

Chris couldn't help but smile, because he knew that Leo was trying to cheer him up, and for some reason he always knew the right words to say. Although, ever since traveling with Leo, there was one thing that hadn't come back, and that was his passion for training and fighting. Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

He had remained at a plateau. He did just enough to maintain his current body and powers, but had done nothing to improve, because still in his mind, he had no goal to accomplish.

The ship had finally arrived at the Shelter, which was placed right by the sea. It was a port Shelter. These days goods were rarely delivered via sea, however many humans still enjoyed living near the water even though there was plenty of it.

There were still ships and more as well, but more so for activities than anything else. It was a joy to see people enjoying their time for once. It also was one of the few Shelters that didn't have a complete wall all around it.

The wall only covered the back of the shelter while anyone could access the place via the sea. At the same time, the landing section for space ships was out into the sea from the shelter. Similar to a pier, there was a large metallic bridge that went into the sea.

Then, there was a large rectangular building sticking upwards. A large place for multiple people to store their vehicles, spaceships, and more. For today though, one of the floors of the landing building had been reserved for them, to get on with what they needed to do.

The spaceship landed on a rectangle shaped square that had a red outline, there were many so it didn't matter which one, one would pick. After that, one had to give their handprint, and then a type of elevator would take the spaceship to a specific spot in the Spaceship park.

Taking an elevator down, they went from the 120th floor to the 19th where the entire place had been cleared of ships, and there were a group of ten people standing there waiting for them, and by their side stood a man in military uniform, but he was a Vampire soldier, not a human.

‚Äî It's a pleasure to meet you, vampire knight Silver, and her two honored guests. ‚Äî The vampire soldier said bowing down. Both Leo and Chris were wearing masks that would cover their faces. Both of them had become somewhat well known, either in the human space, or in the vampire space.

The ten vampires behind them were a mix of men and women of all sorts of ages. Although most of them looked to be in their mid twenties, it probably meant they were around 100 to 200 years old.

They seemed nervous about the whole thing, but at the same time excited. They had also settled down when they could smell that one of the two behind the masks was also a vampire.

‚Äî Everything has been set up for them by Samantha and Fex. All of the vampires will live in the same apartment building next to each other for support. Their rent has been paid for a year and if all goes well that should be enough to get them on their own two feet.

‚Äî The task for you and your bodyguards is to protect them from attackers and to diffuse the situation if there are problems, at least for the first month. After that, we will send somone to check with them once a week to see how they are doing.

‚Äî If all goes well, then we will continue this in the same fashion with a similar size group, eventually increasing the sizes. At times, we also hope have events that will bring Vampires and humans together, but you won't have to worry about that for now. ‚Äî The vampire soldier explained.

A month of bodyguard duty sounded like a long and tiring task, but with no other leads, this would have to do. At least Leo could continue to train for whatever would come his way.

‚Äî A month in the same place... it means, there is a chance that Zero will approach me again, I wonder if he followed us. Maybe he already knows that we are here. I know I declined his offer, but I imagine he won't take a 'no' that easy... I know he won't take a 'no' that easy.

While in the middle of their thoughts, and while the vampire soldier was explaining things to the vampires and Silver, the elevator for the spaceships could be heard moving. It was constant as it always was this whole time, as people moved and more, and toward the centre of the floor one could see the mechanism moving, the spaceships dropping down and then being shifted into the right place.

A spaceship had dropped down, and a strange energy had been noticed by Leo's ability.

‚Äî Silver, Chris, they're here! ‚Äî Leo shouted, drawing his sword.

When the ship passed through the 19th floor, down from where only the ships should be, three individuals rolled off the platform and onto the 19th floor. Standing up, a blonde figure stood in front of them all.

‚Äî I have been looking all over for you, Leo. ‚Äî Erin said.
