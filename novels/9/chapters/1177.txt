Chapter 1178 Consuming beast crystals

The bond between Vorden and Quinn couldn‚Äôt be described by mere words. The second they saw each other, memories started to flood both of their minds of the days they spent with each other. Vorden, one of Quinn‚Äôs first friends. Who had always been by his side. Even when finding out he was a V, when he was betrayed by another close friend of his, Vorden was always there.

It felt strange when he was gone, especially since he was unable to say any last words. Which was why Quinn was adamant that they would bring him back one day. There were very few people that Quinn had this close of a bond with.

Soon another approached Vorden, one who had missed him dearly. It was none other than Sil. Who grabbed Vorden‚Äôs hand and fell to his knees.

"Vorden!" Sil let out almost a shrieking sound as the tears came out running down his face. It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that he had been crying over another.

‚ÄôIs it just me, or is he crying more over Vorden than me?‚Äô Raten thought. ‚ÄôNot that I care anyway.‚Äô

There was one person who felt a little left out, and that was Shiro. Sure he was happy that Sil and Quinn had gotten their long lost friends back, but he couldn‚Äôt feel the same happiness as they did.

"Thank you," Quinn said to Shiro while Sil and Vorden had their own little catch up. "Without you, none of this would have been possible. Remember that you brought us all back together. You have helped out the Cursed faction so much in the little time you have been here."

Shiro wanted to hide his expression from Quinn, looking at the ground, his face full of smiles. He had finally returned the favour back to both of them, for saving him from the cruel life he had experienced at school. Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

Once all of the initial emotions were out of the way, the group sat down as there was quite a bit of catching up. Even Shio was interested, and since Shiro had already helped them out so much, Quinn wasn‚Äôt shy about revealing specific details to him about the vampire world out there.

Despite at any time being able to refuse to help or run away from the situation, Shiro had helped every single time. There was a bond of trust that had been built up between them all. It was interesting to Shiro to know that Quinn was a leader of not just the human world but also the vampire world.

It was expected with how powerful a person he was, but learning that there was a whole planet filled with a different hierarchy system and society was quite amazing. Some things simply went over his head, but he was trying his best to follow.

When Quinn started to talk about Blade Island, Hilston and all the others, both Raten and Vorden were listening intensely. They even clenched fists in anger when learning of the part where Hilston had attacked them all.

Finally, when the tales of everything that had happened were over, the two boys looked over at Sil.

"You actually did that much, you little runt!" Raten said.

"I think what Raten is trying to say is, it seems like you have grown, and you did a lot to help others even without us," Vorden replied.

It was strange for both of them. They had talked to Sil so much inside of his mind, and for them to be able to communicate with each other in the open like so, was just strange.

"What is the plan for now?" Logan asked, noting that they had already used up almost an hour of the time they had left.

Vorden started to attempt to use his body to some type of degree as he wasn‚Äôt quite used to it, but one thing was clear, that he and Raten no longer had the ability to copy other abilities. Even the beast powers were a little strange for them to use.

"Will you be able to eventually learn?" Quinn asked.

"My beast says that he will be happy to guide me on how to use the body," Vorden said. "The beast seems like a cool guy, my style."

Raten didn‚Äôt say anything, but they had seen he had adapted quite well to his beast, already knowing how to use its body, perhaps even better than the beast could.

The next thing they wondered was whether Sil could still use and store up to six abilities. It had been a while since he had touched ability users, so most of his abilities had now disappeared.

"I think it should be okay. When Raten left my mind, my powers seemed to all be there, so I can still move the dragon if need be." Sil mentioned knowing that was one of the requests that had been made. It was a thought that Quinn had put off for a while now. Still, he did eventually want to go back to the island, for more reasons than one, even to look at how his little demon tier seedling was doing.

"For now, I think it‚Äôs safer if the two of you stay outside and just stay out of trouble. Resolving the issue is one thing, but they might ask for a few of their own requests. So if we just say the King tier beast has escaped and there is nothing we can do about it, it would be better for us. There is one thing I want to check though." Quinn said, as he first looked towards Raten.

[Current Evolution at 9 percent]

‚ÄôJudging from the beast I saw in the lab, it means that Raten is currently 9 percent of the way there. Into evolving into a demon tier beast. I wonder how many crystals he would need to get to the next stage.‚Äô Quinn thought.

[King tier humanoid beast]

[Evolution possible]

[Current Evolution at 76 percent]

‚Äô76 percent. Vorden‚Äôs tier level is a few steps below even Raten‚Äôs tier, so perhaps it doesn‚Äôt need as many crystals?‚Äô

"Vorden, would you be up for trying something?" Quinn suggested. Opening up his system, soon crystals started to fall from his hand on the ground, a large many crystals, all different tier levels.

"My crystals!" Raten shouted out, but they soon realised that it was the beast talking and not Raten.

"I‚Äôm sorry, but while travelling through the tunnels, I got lost and came across them. I couldn‚Äôt just leave them there. Anyway, I was wondering Vorden, if you consumed these crystals, I think we could evolve your breasts body to the next stage." Quinn suggested.

The beast that had now taken control over Ratan‚Äôs body looked at Quinn for a second. He soon realised that many of the crystals had gone missing and was wondering just what was going on.

"I know you wanted to evolve yourself." Quinn glanced at the Demi-god tier beast. "But these crystals wouldn‚Äôt be even close enough to evolving yourself, while your friend‚Äôs body is at a closer stage. Helping him level up will be beneficial to us both."

Vorden then picked up the crystals and looked at them, wondering just what he would do with them to help him level up.

"According to the information I obtained from the lab, there are several ways beast can evolve using the energy of the crystal, but for you, the easiest way, for where we are right now, is just to eat them," Logan explained.

"Eat them?" Vorden wondered, looking at the crystals. He soon found himself opening his mouth and chomping down on the crystals. His jaw was many times stronger than that of a human, and the crystal had broken in half. It wasn‚Äôt as bad as Vorden expected, and soon the whole crystal had been consumed.

After consuming the crystal, a warm feeling was felt in his belly, and energy was rising in him, but soon after the rise in energy, he felt quite weak.

"After consuming the crystals, the beasts seem to go into a type of hibernation as their body changes slightly," Logan explained. Even without the system, he was able to gather information similar to what Quinn had.

After eating a few more crystals, Quinn could see it with his system. Vorden was getting closer to his Evolution until eventually, the Evolution started to begin.

Vorden was transforming from a king tier humanoid beast into a legendary humanoid beast.

‚ÄôIf these two can keep evolving up until the demon tier level, the two of them will be the strongest in the Cursed faction.‚Äô Quinn thought.
