Chapter 1150 Bucky steps up

Although Colonel Longblade wasn’t using his full strength to draw out his sword, he still found it strange that someone was able to stop him by just using their bare hands.

’I don’t see any beast gear on him, but he must be holding the scabbard hard enough to cause it to flex inward, trapping the sword itself. Is that even possible with a human’s strength? Could it be that he has an ability to increase his strength?’ Longblade wondered as he seized up the stranger.

Someone with this kind of strength and skill should be known far and wide by now. Information on the Cursed faction wasn’t widely available for anyone outside their faction. Still, Head General Innu had recently conducted a special meeting for high-ranking officers, so they would ingrain certain prominent members. Looking at this person, Longblade was unable to associate him with any of them.

’No, it’s my fault for judging him with human standards when this person is from the Cursed faction. We already know that some of their members are V, but there was no reason for them to give us a full list. For once I agree with Innu’s approach, it might be safer to assume that every single one of them is a V.’ The Colonel concluded and intended to reevaluate the other members at a later point in time as well.

With neither one of them budging, the military leader released the grip on his hilt.

"What’s your name again?" He asked.

"It’s Bucky, Sir. Our Cursed faction’s higher-ups have tasked me to make sure that not a single member of our group is hurt. At least not by fellow allies." Quinn smiled as he explained. It was impossible to pretend to be a nobody at this point, so going with the flow he had decided to appear as some sort of trump card.

Hearing this, Longblade started to laugh and looked over the winner of the last match. Staring at the metal plate covering one of his arms. It wasn’t unusual in this day and age for people to replace their bodies with robotic parts, but then he noticed something.

"Now that I can take a closer look, I should have realised my mistake. We were told that the Green family was working for the Cursed faction, I just never expected them to actually come out on the field. Forgive me for being so rude earlier." Longblade apologised with a gentle bow.

The whole crowd started to gossip between each other as they heard the name ’Green family’. Although not a part of the previous Big Four their influence hadn’t been too far off, by creating a number of systems for the world.

The only thing was, not many people knew that Logan worked on more of the game-like projects compared to the ones his parents worked on. Be it as the creator or with his ability, he had no problem to change it into the way he wished.

"However, that only strengthens my belief that there was foul play involved!" Longblade stated, intending to stir something up. Now that Quinn was on the field though, Logan no longer had anything to worry about, and he just walked past Longblade. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

"As a military man you should be aware that a win is a win. It doesn’t matter if one defeats their enemy through an ’honorable’ one-on-one fight, teams up on the enemy, or utilises traps. A loss in the real world means death. I would love to see people making excuses like that when they are dead." Logan declared, as he continued to walk off.

After learning of who Logan was, there wasn’t a doubt in people’s mind that he had somehow cheated. Avion had already felt that something was off, but with this knowledge he was certain that he had been cheated.

"I want a rematch!" Avion demanded. "Let’s use real Mechs and fight again! I have practically dedicated my life to these machines, so it’s impossible for me to misjudge the timing if you hadn’t messed with it!"

"Stand down." Longblade ordered the pilot. "Do you really think there will be much of a difference in a real match? If he can alter the game system, he must be able to alter any system. It might hurt your pride but I won’t permit you to risk your life in such a stupid way. We still need you for the war against the Dalki!"

"He has a point, in a real fight if your Mech’s sensors got scrambled and something like this was to happen, who would you complain to?"

"Which is why I suggest something else. I’m sure you know that the game can be used in other ways. Not only can it simulate a field for Mechs to fight in, but also one for our users to fight in. Similar to the game Power Fighters. If you are up for it, we can fight again. In the real world you could do nothing to alter our fighting skills with your abilities, so hope you wouldn’t claim it was fair to do that again if you were to alter yourself and opponent in this match? What do you say?" Longblade offered.

It was a troublesome request. Of course they could just decline this little game. After all, even though Logan could fight, he wasn’t the best to go against someone who used beast weapons regularly. Even if he did use the system, the Colonel would call it out straight away as soon as he noticed something off, possibly stopping the match midway.

"Well there’s really no upside to this whole thing." Fex complained who was still sulking in the stands. "Logan already beat that Avion guy, so there’s no need for us to play a match by their rules."

"I do agree, but I think ’Bucky’ might have other ideas."

"I’ll take you up on that offer." Quinn agreed. "We don’t want you to accuse Logan of cheating again, so he won’t participate. How about I give it a shot? After all, I am a member of the Cursed faction as well. Any objections?"

Longblade didn’t like the fact that this enigma had so willingly excluded Logan. He also didn’t like the fact that ’Bucky’ was this confident, but he had met many foolish young people in his life, hoping he was just one of them.

"That sounds great. What better way to bring our two factions closer together than through the art of combat and coalition. Before you accept though there are a few rules." Longblade nodded as he continued to smile, not showing his concern.

"Master Green here is to stay in the stands far away from any of the machinery. Before your fight is to take place we shall have a test run, and the game we shall play won’t exactly be the same as Power Fighters either."

"As you have already noticed, everyone of my soldiers uses a bladed weapon. The most common one is a sword to do battle. To make it a little more fun we have altered the gaming system. Each combatant starts off with a hundred points of Health. Each blow takes off points, up to a maximum of ten if you hit a lethal spot. For a regular hit five."

"I know in the real world, one would die from a stab to the heart or the head, but this is all for us to improve our skills. After all, there are some foes we face that don’t die even after suffering such an injury. So what do you say?"

Logan, who was still there, didn’t like it. Nobody in the present Cursed group used swords as their weapons. With all things in the Colonel’s favour, Logan expected Quinn to refuse or at least make some demands of his own.

"I’m in. Shall we start now?" Quinn asked with a smile.

It came to a surprise for most of the Cursed and they were wondering just what Quinn was up to. Leaving the field, Logan didn’t even have time to ask, but Quinn just gave him a thumbs up as he neared the stands.

"Excellent, I am very pleased we have someone who doesn’t shy away." Longblade bellowed out as he turned and made his way to the other side of the field, yet his fake smile soon turned into a frown.

’Is he this confident because of what he is? We have to win this fight to prove to the people that the V are something that can be dealt with. Most are afraid of the V and disgusted by them, there is only a select view that isn’t swayed by the countless rumours, that going the Cursed will turn you into a V and give you great power.’

Whether right or wrong, Longblade had his own reasons for wanting to win this fight. As stipulated, they witnessed a fight between two other soldiers take place before the main one. The field had changed once again, this time into a stony area with several large rocks and pillars all around.

The two of them used their swords and the field reacted as it would to in real life, each slash against the rocks would cut and break them, and even the attacks against each other would simulate the pain and reaction their body would feel.

The only difference was, that once the pain disappeared the wound would heal instantly. At the same time, everyone could see the health bars above go down as each opponent struck each other.

’I see. Well, it seems I’ve learned a lot, watching them.’

As for Quinn’s reason for wanting to fight, it was actually quite childish. Similar to Fex’s dream of piloting a Mech, when Quinn had first entered the military academy and joined the beast weapons class, he had originally wanted to use a sword to do battle.

The main reason he hadn’t selected that weapon was due to the system informing him it wouldn’t have supported his Blood swipe and other blood powers compared to the gauntlets. Now that he had extreme strength, speed, reflexes and experience under his belt, Quinn wanted to see how exactly he would fare with the weapon he had once neglected.

With the match over, Quinn’s and the Colonels’ match was about to begin.

"Come on Bucky, kick his arse!" Fex shouted and cheered as loud as he could. Since the whole arena was now chanting the name of Longblade. It was quite overwhelming as the loud sound was drowning out everything, and Fex even had to cover his sensitive ears.

’Quinn, good luck.’ Layla thought.

"What a surprise to stumble upon an Ex agent of Pure in this place." A voice whispered behind her.
