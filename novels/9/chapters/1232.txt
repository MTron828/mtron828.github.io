Chapter 1233 Alien Vs Predetor Part 2

The strange pulse that was felt coming from Hilston had stopped Slicer in her tracks. As soon as it hit her, a tingling feeling was felt in her body that she just couldn't shake off and soon, she felt her whole body going numb. This was what had allowed her to receive a devastating blow.

Still, it didn't take long after the attack for Slicer to dig her way out of the sand, even though Hilston was using his Telekinesis to bury her deeper by the second. She was soon seen shooting out from the ground, blood falling from her back, and it partially seared from the attack.

"That one hurt a bit! You got anymore like that in you?!" Slicer continued her taunting, before she jumped into the air once more. The five spiked Dalki was far more injured than she herself realised and her body had started to tilt during her flight, making her come in at an odd angle, but it didn't matter to her.

Hilston activated his Demon tier's Armour special set skill once more and the pulse went outward. Although she couldn't see the attack, she could feel that the armour had done something and remembering what had just happened, she tried to find a gap of some sort.

The invisible pulse was coming out like a bubble hitting everything in the area. Only a slight change could be seen if one was to look closely similar to a heatwave on a hot day. Slicer flapped her wings with all her power in an attempt to get outside of its possible range, but eventually she got hit, causing her body to freeze again.

With Hilston's Teleportation ability, he was soon in front of her, and happily delivered another flame punch to her face. After teleporting again, his next punch was aimed at her side and he continued to pummel her. The teleportation attacks with the flame punches were proving to be effective. Getting hit another time, Slicer's anger had risen and she bore through the effects swinging her tail out at the same time, hearing a familiar clang.

That was the sign that his active skill had stopped working, and Hilston increased the distance between the two of them again.

"You damn cheat! Stop running away and fight me fair and square!" Slicer demanded in her fury, her appearance looking more and more like a piece of charcoal.

"My armour is merely a tool, just like my abilities, as are your wings and your tail. There is no honour in a fight, just a winner!" Hilston stated.

What he was using was the active armour skill called Disruptive pulse. It was a set of Demon tier armour all with the same skill. However, its range and area where it worked was limited if one only had one part of the Demon tier set. For example, the armour covering his hands only allowed him to use the skill on physical touch, which was what he had done the first time, but when having the whole armour set on, one could affect everything in a certain area.

Disruptive pulse was a Demon tier active skill that even Hilston didn't know every use of. So far it had stopped any ability that was touched by the pulse, a person's actions, beasts and more. This Demon tier set was perfect for someone like Hilston, allowing him to use his strongest moves against his enemies while they were frozen in place, at the same time, disrupting his opponents most powerful moves.

Nevertheless, there was a small downside to it. The armour he was wearing needed to be charged up, something that only happened after it had received a certain amount of damage. The stronger the opponent, the quicker that happened and only then was he able to use the active skills.

The watching community was going crazy cheering on Hilston to beat the five spiked Dalki. They had yet to really grasp Slicer's strength, so most could not truly understand the great feat that was happening at the moment.

Hilston continued to fight in this style using the active skill and his strong abilities, mainly the fire one to pound his enemy, his fists were seen being covered in green blood. Even though Slicer's strength was rising, it didn't matter as she had yet to find a way to get out of the pulse. Each time it went through her body she became defenceless, unable to fight against it.

Given her personality and pride as a Dalki leader she wasn't one to run away either, but finally, for some reason, Hislton had stopped using it; he had stopped using the pulse. This was first noticed by Slicer when her attack had gotten through and it wasn't just a hit out of desperation this time. Still, it had only clashed against his armour.

Hilston had blocked the attack from his head, another attack followed up from Slicer and he barely blocked that one too. The third strike came at an angle that would be impossible to block, so instead the Blade leader teleported away.

Slicer, slightly surprised about the sudden reversal, quickly figured out the situation. Then she started to laugh to herself. "Now I understand. You can't do that weird thing anymore, can you?" Slicer questioned him, yet Hilston didn't bother to give her an answer.

There was no need for it either as the circumstances spoke for themselves. N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

Hilston had long since expected the Dalki to fall before him, but she had proven far more resilient than he had ever anticipated, able to survive even his strongest abilities. This was the very first time someone had been able to last long enough that the charges of Disruptive pulse had actually run out. Now he was forced to stay on the defensive and wait for the attacks to charge it back up. Which was why he was also reluctant to use his teleportation ability.

It was then that Slicer did something strange that no one had expected. Using her long tail, she aimed at the base, the tip skimmed around the edge, and the next second it could be seen falling into the sand. Blood started to spew everywhere, dying the sand green. The wound quickly healed, until she let out a shriek and a new tail grew in its place.

Slicer quickly did this two more times, chopping off her tails, regrowing a new one, each one looking more impressive than the last and even longer. Then picking up both of her tails, she held them in her hands.

It was a gruesome sight to see, a Dalki using its own body part as some type of weapon, but at the same time, for those watching it just sent a shiver down their spine. Showing just how blood hungry they were, to not even give it a second thought to do such a thing.

"Why won't that thing die! So much of its blood has been split!" A viewer commented.

"I haven't gotten to a six spike yet, So I need to push myself even further!" Slicer said, with bloodshot eyes. Although her approach seemed to be a double-edged sword, her current tail was double the size of the one had originally had but even she didn't know how much longer she would last with so little Dalki blood left inside her.

Not too far away from where the fight was taking place, A small group could be seen walking in the sand.

"It looks like everyone who was around the Cursed ship has left this place." Fex commented. Looking at the dead human and Dalki bodies around. Most of them were the Chained, but there were a few humans from the Cursed group as well.

Fex was soon seen wrapping them up, mummifying them with his string. His strings even though they looked light, could be used as quite the weight. On the way back, they would make sure to give their bodies a proper funeral. Right now, the members of the cursed faction had an important job to do, and among them was determined Sil, who was ready to make his move.
