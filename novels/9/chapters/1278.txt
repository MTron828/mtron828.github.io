Chapter 1279 - Beast Tamer

In the grand universe where the beast planets were located, the Cursed ship was currently making its way towards the Cursed faction planets. They had been informed that the Earthborn group as well as the Graylash group were already under attack, so they were worried that the Cursed faction would be next.

Unlike in the past, when the Dalki had owned one half of the beast planets circulating around the solar system's sun, while humanity in the other, the balance had shifted to the point that the latter were down to a total of nine planets.

It was hard to decide where it was exactly safe for the humans to travel. In one half of the solar system, the planets that the humans used to own were split into the three sections belonging to the three groups.

The Earthborn planets were situated directly in the centre between the planets of the other two factions. The Cursed ship had left from Planet Caladi, which was located in the Earthborn section and was now heading over to the Cursed faction section, but would have to go past planets that had already been taken over.

They strayed widely from the other planets and wanted to make it so they were a reasonable distance both from the Cursed faction planets and the Earthborn planets.

However, not too long after setting off on their journey, the Cursed ship had been put to a halt, as it had received some devastating news. .

"Miss Megan, we have terrible news!" One of the Cursed members shouted from inside the teleportation room. "The teleporter you told us to keep watch out for, it has gone offline! It's not activating at all. We have performed all the tests to check if it's something on our end‚Ä¶ but the result was that whatever happened to the teleporter had to have occured on the other end!"

"Worst case scenario, judging by how abruptly the signal has cut off without any prior warning, the most likely scenario is that it was destroyed!"

Just as the Cursed faction member had reported, the teleporter had gone offline. Just seconds ago, it had been glowing brightly as the portal had been designated the highest priority. Everyone had been instructed to do everything in their power to keep it active, so they could use it as soon as the fighting would start.

Hearing this news, Megan was biting down hard on her nails inside the command centre.

"What do I do? What can we do? Does it mean those guys are in trouble?"

"I'm sure Sam will give us an update on their situation any second now. Let's wait for his response before we decide on what to do next." Chucky tried to calm Megan down, while Shiro nodded in approval.

The two of them got on with each other, since they had seen each other around the school, and they were also currently the ones helping out Megan take care of the Cursed ship while the others were away.

"Even if their teleporter is broken, aren't there other ways to reach them? Like maybe we could ask to use one from the Earthborn group? They should have one that leads to Earth, and then we can fly to Blade Island from there?" Shiro suggested.

"No, we can't." Megan shook her head. "Supreme Commander Sach has put out an executive order that no one is to use that one. Even though Logan had created the jammers, he deems it too risky. Right now, no one is allowed to have active teleporters leading to Earth. The one on Blade Island was meant to be the sole exception to that rule."

"The only way to head back to Earth is through the space station‚Ä¶ which is offline." CHùíÜCk for ùíèew stùíêries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Even though they might be able to reason with Supreme Commander Sach under normal circumstances, right now he was busy with his own set of troubles. This was also the reason why Megan hadn't called Sam straight back, after all signs pointed to the teleporter being destroyed.

She couldn't risk distracting any of them, if they were in the middle of fighting. Still, Megan did send out a message and if all things were still okay then Sam should hopefully be giving her a reply soon.

"What about Sergeant Nathan?" Chucky asked. "He used to be a Head General, right? Don't you think he could perhaps still pull some strings for us and get that Earth station working again? Besides, depending on how large the forces are attacking Blade island, we could use Nathan's and his group's help anyway."

It was a good suggestion, so Megan got ready to call Nathan, but one thought passed through her head. What about the Cursed faction planets? For now they had working teleporters on their planets, but who is to say the Dalki didn't find a way to outright destroy those teleporters?

Wasn't there a good chance that whatever happened on Blade Island would happen here again? Would it really be alright to have the Cursed ship head to Earth? It would be a long time before they could arrive‚Ä¶

"The decision is up to you. Sam trusted you, so we will go with whatever you say." Shiro tried to encourage her and Chucky also agreed with that.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

After the almighty roar from the Demon tier beast, everyone was already running towards the top of the castle. It was the perfect vantage point to allow them to see where exactly the enemy was coming from and how many of them there were.

To everyone's surprise, their numbers far surpassed even their wildest speculations.

"I thought that we might have had some time to prepare more." Sam sighed, looking out into the distance. The ships were far away and moving slowly towards them, but it just meant they would soon face an organised and coordinated attack.

Everyone had believed that things would go down just like it had happened on the other planets when the Dalki had invaded, namely that a mothership of some kind would have appeared and sent down Dalki.

However there was one person who was not with the group. Mona stood far out on the sandy beach of the island, looking into the sea.

"Thanks for the little warning." Mona grinned, as she lifted up her pointy hat a little to be able to have a better look. Finally the ships were starting to make their way towards the island.

"These guys really seem to think that taking over Blade Island will be that easy." She smiled, soon throwing off her hat to the side revealing her long braided dark purple hair that almost looked black, apart from when it moved in the sunlight.

Running out on the sand, Mona looked fearless and not for a second did she slow down her pace. Eventually, she leapt into the air, jumping several feet, a height no regular human would be able to reach without top tier beast armour.

After she passed the shore line, there was only the sea below her and it looked like she would crash into it at any second, but then a dark shadow from underneath appeared. Moments before her toes could touch the water Mona landed on a solid white surface.

In the giant sea of water, a small white piece of land had suddenly appeared, and it slowly started to rise higher and higher, and that's when those from the castle could see what it was as well.

"That looks awfully similar to the giant creature that attacked us when we first arrived here‚Ä¶ only a little different?" Logan did not remember the beast having white skin, and at the same time its eyes were almost glowing blue. Not only that, but now that it had revealed itself its overall size seemed to have increased a little as well.

Four ships that were headed out front tried to quickly avoid the giant octopus and attempted to go around the side of it. Soon though, they could see large tentacles in its view. Two of them were slammed out of the air, and their ships sank into the sea.

One of the other spaceships had managed to fly out further to the left of the beast, allowing it to notice the creature before the others. Being further back it had managed to avoid the attack, but soon a jet of water, that spiralled out and shot out like a laser hit the ship blowing it up on the spot.

The final fourth ship seeing this was thankful that the beast had chosen not to use its attack on itself, and was hoping to land upon the planet soon. However, that's when he noticed at the last second, running on one of the tentacles, was a female looking human.

When Mona got to the end of the beasts' tentacle, it soon grabbed her, and threw her towards the fourth ship. Using her great strength, she grabbed on to the back, and lifted both her hands. Activating the power of all her beast gear she slammed down causing an explosion by the engine, and quickly jumped back off, allowing the octopus beast to catch her again and place her on the head.

"Unfortunately for you, I owe that Cursed boy, and his grandfather a favour." Mona spoke, seemingly to herself. "As the only one of the former Big Four present, I will make sure that you pay a heavy price if you intend to reach that island."

It was at that moment, Quinn used his Inspect skill, noticing the octopus had clearly demonstrated a speed, strength, size and skills surpassing its former self, yet it looked too similar to the last one to be a different beast.

"Did you really think you were the only ones that knew how to evolve beasts?" Quinn didn't need to turn around to be able to imagine that smug smile that was sure to be on Eno's face.
