Chapter 1161 Unlikely Pair

Fortunately, Logan hadn’t gotten too close to the beast before it had opened its eyes.

’Why did I trust the amount the scientists stated?’ Logan blamed himself for this grave miscalculation. When going through the terminal via his ability, he had read the report about how much of the pink gas had to be used to subdue the beast. As such, that was also the amount he had used, yet the beast before him showed no sign of being sleepy or even drowsy.

’Was it smart enough to fool them, waiting for an opportunity such as this all along? It’s even able to imitate our speech to a degree where I can understand it, so it’s undeniably intelligent. To have learned so much by just observing humans during its captivity... no if this one is already this crafty, doesn’t that mean that Quinn and the others might be in danger?’

"I’ve never seen you before, you seem younger than the others?" The black beast spoke as it sniffed the air. It was around 7 foot tall, a little smaller than a Dalki, but Logan looked even smaller than a middle schooler in comparison.

"That’s because I’m not with the others." Logan explained as he took a careful step back. If the humanoid beast was able to talk, then perhaps he could reason with it without the need for a fight.

"Then why did you use the gas? If you just wanted to free me you could have done so without it. You might not be one of them, but all you humans want my crystal." The beast placed its hand around its chest where one’s heart would be on a human.

"You use our crystals to power items, like the weapons you hunt us with. To all of you we are simply tools. Even the armour and that arm of yours must have been created from the crystals from one of our kind."

The red in the beast’s eyes was getting more fierce as it spoke. Logan didn’t know how fast or strong that beast was. There had been some data on it, but since it had fooled the scientists about the guess, it was safer to assume it had been hiding its true strength as well.

"Not all of us are the same." Logan replied, ready to defend himself at any moment. It still hadn’t attacked him, so he didn’t want to do anything to make it. "There are beasts in nature who attack us on site."

"You’re the ones who have invaded our home." The beast replied. "Wouldn’t you attack someone who entered your territory? Just because others of my kind don’t possess the ability to reason with you and do what is natural you justify killing our kind? Are you saying I get to live because I have some form of intelligence? Then what happens when something more intelligent than yourself comes along, does that mean you all deserve to die?"

Were it not for the dangerous situation he was in, Logan would be admiring the beast’s ability to reason right now. It was the first time for him to come across a humanoid beast, he had never realised just how... human they were. Were it not for its outer appearance it would be hard to distinguish it from one.

"I know why you’re doing this. You need our crystals because your kind is at war. I have heard this numerous times already. One of you confided in me, claiming how she felt bad about doing this to me. However, it was not because she was sorry for me, no your kind just feels conflicted because I have taken on a form resembling your kind!"

"Just because your kind is fighting against those you call Dalki, you justify what you do to us! You don’t even care what you do to our home. The planet is a living thing too and those crystals you mine are what powers the life force all around us. It creates the nests for us to come to live. Getting rid of the crystals means destroying our home!" Throwing out his hand, a swift sound was made through the air.

The distance between the two of them was around ten meters, yet Logan knew the beast wouldn’t just swipe through the air for no reason. Pressing his hand on a terminal nearby, his eyes started to glow green.

A beast of this level of intelligence, even if it hasn’t reached a higher rank, would be a foe that he couldn’t go easy on. Activating his soul weapon. Several of the tubes that were stuck in the terminals started to move about like snakes. The ones on the ground quickly wrapped around each other forming a type of shield in front of Logan, while the ones from above came down trying to attack the beast.

’Good thing I’m in a lab.’ However, Logan soon saw that the machinery was useless in stopping the beast attacks, as the temporary shield that had been made was ripped through. The machinery that had tried to attack the beast suffered the same fate. The beast started to run around the room they were in around the edge of the room in circles, Logan continued to use its powers trying to trap it or slow it down. He even formed a blaster on his hand, firing at it.

As each thing came towards it, the beast would use its agility to dodge the cables. Each foot step looked incredibly light and the amount of time it spent touching the surface of the ground was close to none.

’Does it have wind powers? Is that what makes it faster than my speed suit? I’m just going to have to try and create something that can face it, while it’s being distracted.’

Using his powers, the terminals around started to deconstruct into spiders and soon they were forming into other things. Unfortunately, the beast ignored all the machinery and continued pursuing Logan. It leapt up on the side of the wall, and pushed using its powerful legs. It spun its body and several of its tails started to spin with it. All the cables that would come close to it were being pushed away by the power of the wind its tails were creating.

’Damn it!’ Before Logan could change his plan, the beast appeared directly in front of him and the only thing he could do was lift his robotic arm to block its strike. The beast looked confident as it went to grab hold of the arm latching onto it. It ripped into it with its claws and once the metal was off, the scale-like black arm became visible.

For some reason it paused, instead of continuing its attack. Not one to let go of this opportunity, Logan slammed the beast into the ground with all his strength. Hitting the ground, the boy pinned the beast down and placed his Dalki hand around its neck, gripping and holding it in place, slowly squeezing.

’Looks like the training with Brock was worth it. I’m no longer useless in a direct fight!’

"You...are you a beast as well?" The beast managed to let out, as it lifted its arms and grabbed Logan’s wrist, slowly pushing it away. "Why... why are you with the ones that are trying to kill us then?!"

The beast was clearly angry, but Logan’s Dalki arm was far more powerful than it had expected. Even using all its strength it was hard for it to push Logan off. So it resorted to the only thing it could do at the time. It opened its mouth revealing its sharp teeth and bit down on Logan’s hand. At that moment, green blood started to ooze from the wound and flowed into the beast’s mouth.

However, that was a mistake. This only increased the energy inside of Logan’s body giving him more force pushing the beast back down.

"Your blood! It’s not red! If you’re no human there is no reason to fight!" The beast exclaimed in surprise.

’If I knew it would be this easy, I would have let it bite my arm from the start. Now what should I do, before it realises its mistake? It seems to be willing to listen now, so we should get out before anybody comes here. Convincing them to join us might pose a problem, though.’

"That’s what I said." Logan softened his grip. "I’m not with them. Come with me if you want to get out."

The next second, the door opened up. Their fight had created a lot of noise and had attracted two scientists dressed in white robes, accompanied by around twenty armed soldiers.

"Isn’t that the kid from the Cursed faction?" One of the soldiers pointed out.

"But look at his arm!" Another screamed out, pointing at it. "That’s a Dalki arm!"

"Maybe it’s just a beast transformation skill." A third soldier reasoned.

"Who cares who or what the kid is!" The older looking scientist shouted. "He has broken into this facility and wanted to kidnap our test subject. Kill the boy and capture the beast alive!"

Seeing how bad the situation had just turned out, there was only one thing Logan could do. He completely let go of the beast and moved to the side. The two of them gazed at each other and nodded as if they had come to an understanding. If they were going to get out of this one, the two of them would have to work together.
