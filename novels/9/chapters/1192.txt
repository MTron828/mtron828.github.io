Chapter 1193 Fight for Freedom

The sounds of alarm blaring throughout the Cursed ship were of course related to the unending influx of Dalki attack reports happening throughout the beast solar system. Supreme Commander Sach had ordered to share their intel in real time with not only the main groups’ faction leaders but also all their known affiliates.

Right now, the Cursed faction’s command centre was busier than ever and everyone on board the ship was preparing their beast gear and checking their supplies. A lot of them had families living on the Cursed faction planets and they were now extremely worried about their well being.

Of course the one who was responsible for deciding how to deal with this situation was none other than Sam. The frown on his forehead was deep as he was troubled as to how to react.

’What’s the right thing to do?’ Sam considered the options as he looked at the situation as a whole. Those in the Cursed faction wished to protect their families which was only right. Unfortunately, the Earthborn group as well as the Graylash family were both in as much trouble, if not more so and each had sent out a plea for help.

"Quinn, you finally answered we were just told-"

"The Dalki are already here, Sam!" Quinn cut the other off before he could finish his sentence. "I don’t know the exact situation from your point of view, but I trust you to make the right decision. You’ve always known what’s best for the Cursed faction. You’ve never let us down before, so I doubt you will start now!"

With that the call abruptly ended. Though it was faint, Sam was sure to have heard the sound of explosions in the background. It appeared as the fight had already begun. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

’Truthfully, with Helen and Quinn there they already have the biggest support of the Cursed faction.’ Sam thought. ’However, no matter how strong they might be, there’re just two of them, yet so many Dalki and planets we have to save...’

Death was unavoidable in a war, especially in a situation like this, where they had practically been caught with their pants down. Nobody had ever accounted for a scenario in which the Dalki would have enough forces to attack all of humanity’s planets at once.

Of course, the Cursed faction would like to help out their own first, but strategically that wasn’t the best option. Should they allow the Earthborn group or the Graylash family to fall, they would become prone to suffering from pincer attacks in the future.

’Have the Dalki hidden their actual numbers, did they find a way to create more or are their forces just too strong for us? Whatever the case, with the teleporters jammed we can only send out reinforcements by ship, but if they are already struggling, it’s unlikely that they can wait for us to visit one after the other.’

’There’s also a risk that our forces won’t be strong enough if we split them up too much. At the moment, both Sach and Owen are thinking about the future, trying to keep as many beast planets in their position to continue the fight in this war. I’m afraid that this might be a burst attack, aimed to deal with us now and in one go.’

’The best course of action would be to give up some of the planets and gather our forces on fewer planets. Having too many territories just thins out our own forces, and if we’re really already struggling this much, we will eventually lose those planets anyway. Our priority should be to survive and struggle as long as possible... hoping for a miracle.’

If there was one person Sam had confidence in most, it was Quinn. Perhaps he would be able to win the battle for them at the Cursed faction at the same time, there was another reliable person with him who could command just as well, if not better during a state of crisis.

’Helen, Quinn. I’m sorry but I’m going to have to leave the Cursed faction planets in your hands.’

After the decision had been made, the leaders of the Cursed faction had been called for a meeting. The crew on board the ship were getting restless as news was spreading about what was taking place, none of it good.

"So you plan to help out the Graylash faction and the Earthborn group?! I don’t think that will go down too well with the others." Dennis stated his opinion after hearing the explanation.

"I have already sent a message to Supreme Commander Sach advising him to give up on saving every planet. We need to focus on splitting our own people, and groups into two squads. Nathan, and the two military groups that were originally put under us, you will head to help out the Earthborn planets. Nathan, as a former Head General I trust you to do as you see fit. Go now!"

The military groups originally given to them by Oscar, combined, were nearly as large as the remaining Cursed faction forces. With this it was more of a numbers game rather than strength.

The sit-in was too urgent for them to remain and listen to the rest of the meeting. The more time delayed the harder it would be for all of them. With the order given, Nathan was already heading out and contacting the other sergeants and groups. Soon several ships could be seen leaving the Cursed ship, and those that drifted in space, would go along with them towards the Earthborn group.

"That still doesn’t solve the original problem, if you send our people to the Graylash section they will be unwilling to fight!" Dennis argued. "It might be fine for those from the military since they never acted as a part of us. Their families never moved to the Cursed planets after the groups belonged to us. But it’s different for the others still here. How can one fight when they are worried about their loved ones?"

"I know..." Sam admitted with a sigh. The thing was, as a man who had to look at the whole picture things like emotions, feeling and morale were hard to take into consideration when on the battlefield. Still, he knew that they did have a great effect when one was fighting as well, but it was unpredictable. "The Cursed faction people will be in good hands, just trust in Quinn and Helen. They need to understand, that if we don’t help out the Cursed faction, then we will-"

Once again, in the command room itself, red lights started to flash in the centre. Soon, the screen that was covering the glass window allowed them to see outside. The sensor displayed a large ship heading their way. It wasn’t alone as there were several smaller ships by its side as well.

"Who is it? Have the Dalki come to attack us directly?" Megan horridly questioned.

When the ship came to view on the camera though, it didn’t look like the typical black Dalki ships. No, those looked like they had a human touch. It wasn’t one of the Bertha ship’s either, so it was hard to pinpoint just who it belonged to.

"Move, I’m taking over!" Logan shouted as he climbed up onto the meeting table, and jumped across to the main control centre. The others made way for him to place his hands on the ship. "Activate shields!" Logan ordered the Cursed faction ship and crystal energy immediately created several layers of protection, just in time to absorb the shots that had been fired their way.

As the shots hit the shields the whole ship shook a few times from the great power.

"What’s happening? Aren’t they humans, why are they attacking us?" Shiro asked. Sil, who was standing next to him suddenly noticed something, and his body started to shake. It was the first time Shiro had ever seen his friend like that.

———

A large man stood in front of a hall of hundred people, his diamond-like armour shining menacingly. His audience didn’t look particularly happy to see him, although it could have something to do with their own sad state. They all looked small, malnourished, un-energised and in general a bit lost.

"Today’s your lucky day. Those people took something very precious from me and I’ve come to get it back. You are not to kill any blonde haired people you see on the ship. Doing so will mean that I will make your already miserable existence even worse!"

"However, as for the rest, they must be punished for what they have done! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for you all. Depending on your performance, I will free you from this place. You will no longer have to remain on my ship and I promise you that our paths will never cross again. As a nice little extra bonus, whoever can subdue this son of mine, will receive rewards that will allow you to live like a king for the rest of your lives!"

A picture of Sil was being displayed in front of them. Hearing this, the eyes of the hundred or so people started to light up, hope visibly returning to them. A chance to escape this living hell where they were being treated worse than any prisoners. No matter what, they would be fighting for their freedom... or die trying!
