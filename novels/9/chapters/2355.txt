Quinn could somewhat sense the different energies around, but it wasn't as accurate as what Leo could do with his ability, nor was it as routine as sensing someone's celestial power when he was a celestial. 

Nonetheless, due to his training in Qi, he could sense strong energies and would somewhat know what level the opponent in front of him was at. In a sense, there were many people that had this same sense. 

For vampires it was more of a natural instinct they had when sensing power. With this, Quinn could tell that the Demon General in front of him was stronger than the one he had faced before. 

'Based on what the system states, there are more than five races, but out of all the demon races, there must be ones that are more powerful. If I can gather the blood of all of them, then my blood aura can increase even more.' Quinn thought. 

'The last blood aura evolution gave me quite a boost, and for the next one, it's quite possible that it can make me even stronger.'

For what he had in mind, he might need all the strength he could get. It truly felt like he was close to squeezing everything he could out of the system. For it to finally give him a quest after all this time, maybe this was his moment.

In the middle of his thoughts, the Freytlin flew forward with its body covered in the blue aura. With the enemy coming towards him, Quinn had used his blood aura to send multiple swords towards him. 

As the swords got close, the blue aura was moving to protect the body of the Freytlin general. It stopped the swords from piercing and slashing by covering the energy rather than directly blocking it. 

'It flows differently from blood aura… but it doesn't seem to be as strong, maybe it's more defensive based, like my shadow.'

Regardless, the countless number of swords was too much and Quinn knew this would be the case. As a sword stabbed right through its chest. The Freytlin winced in pain, and stared hard at Quinn. 

"Although you may be stronger than the last Demon General I faced, I have grown much stronger compared to before as well." Quinn said. 

Several blood swords moved, stabbing the demon, one after the other. The demon's life was still strong despite all the swords that had pierced him. Gathering his fist, Quinn moved through the air at a speed that made it look like he was teleporting. 

He appeared right in front of the Demon General, and punched his head with a blood fist causing it to explode right in the air. 

One of the biggest threats had been dealt with, and looking down below, he could see that it looked like the others were almost done as well. In the meantime. He continued to get rid of the creatures that were pouring through the portal and with his limitless ability, he wasn't tiring in the slightest. 

——-

Down below, Logan continued to keep an eye on Agent 4, who was now working away on some runes that were on Jessica, and that's when he noticed something strange. 

He hadn't said anything straight away, because he was unsure himself, but it was when he decided he just had to ask the question.

"Agent 4!" Logan spoke through a projected voice on the spider on his shoulder. "I have been paying attention to the runes that you have been drawing around Jessica. It appears that for one, there were no runes placed around her in the first place. 

"So instead you are drawing new runes." 

"That is correct." Agent 4 responded. "You see, I'm trying to stop the energy from returning to her. It was set up so the energy would come out of her, to open the portal, and if we just reverse the process then that is what will end up killing her. Which is why I need to change it a little." 

"I see, I understand that somewhat, but then I wanted to ask, these runes, they are ones that I have never seen before." Logan continued with his suspicions.

"We talked about this before, right? That the symbols of magic are more like an art. Just like a painting I can alter its state to fit what is needed. I can see the flow and that is what I am currently doing. You have no reason to worry." 

While in the middle of doing this, the others had seen Quinn take care of the Demon General. As the swords pierced through its body, a strange dark blue liquid, what appeared to be its blood, had fallen onto the ground, all over the place.

The others hadn't paid too much attention to it, just assuming that it was blood, but after a few moments of landing on the ground, it started to move. It began to bubble up, and the blood was moving together. 

As all of the blood touched each other, it continued to bubble more and more, growing larger, until it had formed the same Demon General once again. 

'That Quinn is indeed a strong opponent. I doubt I even got him to reveal most of his power.' The general thought. 'The good thing is that he wasn't my target in the first place.' 

Lifting both of his hands, the strong dark blue aura started to gather in them both. Feeling the energy, they had all turned around to see what was in front of them. I think you should take a look at

"Isn't that… what Quinn was fighting against, but he killed it, how is it down here?" Andy asked. 

It was no time for questions, as it had already launched toward them. The three that had defeated Magnus were the quickest to react, and were ready to deal with his one. 

That was until straight from above like a comet, Quinn landed his fist on top of its head, crushing it into nothing but blood once again and landing on the ground. 

"I see, I thought it was a little too easy, from the looks of things you can form yourself through your own blood, and even now your blood is moving, trying to come together. If I continue to kill you the same way I have done so far, then you will just keep coming back. I think I know what I can do." 

The mask that was on Quinn's face, he turned the dial changing its attribute to that of fire. Adding it to his blood aura, he placed his hand on the ground. Letting out his blood aura, he surrounded the entire area, including the area where the others were at. 

The blood aura seemed to go around them, rather than underneath them like they had done with the blood. After that, the fiery blood aura was having its effect. It was bringing out the dark blue blood, turning it into nothing but a gas until it had all completely disappeared. 

"That seems to have fixed the problem." Quinn said, and then looked at Agent 4, who was standing next to Jessica, as well as the others. 

"You have all done a good job in helping out, and you have managed to protect Jessica as well as get rid of Magnus." Quinn stated. "For now, I can say earth is safe, this universe is safe, but as long as Immortui continues to live, that won't continue to be the case. 

"Agent 4, is everything ready?" Quinn asked.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Agent 4 looked at the ground at all the changed runes, as well as everything else, and nodded.

"Good, close the portal." 

With those words said, Agent 4 rushed from where he was standing over to Jessica's position, and drew one last symbol on his hand, when that was done he placed it on the ground, and all of the symbols started to light up. 

Once again a large circle appeared above the area where they were standing and then the energy was shooting out from the portal, and it was heading right back to where they were. The portal was getting smaller by the second. 

'It looks like Agent 4 wasn't hiding anything after all.' Logan thought. 

The rest looked at Quinn, wanting to thank him for all the help but instead he just looked at Agent 4. 

"How much time do I have?" Quinn asked. 

"About ten seconds, I thought you would only need that much time." Agent 4 replied. 

"Good." Quinn replied. "No one can follow me that way." 

Before anyone could ask what they were talking about, what Quinn was saying, he had jumped from the position he was in, and was running right through the sky. The portal was closing and before it did, Quinn had gone right through it, on to the other side.
