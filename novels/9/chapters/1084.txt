Chapter 1085 - The glowing eyes

The second fleet of the Graylash family was currently being attacked and boarded by several Dalki, and on the main ship alarm bells were ringing throughout.

Despite all of the drills they had gone through in case of such a situation, panic spread around various places of the ship. Usually even with an attack they would have a few moments to brace themselves of what was to come, but they did not enjoy such luxury this time.

Messages of this type were constantly being announced through the intercom, informing everyone that areas were being lost left and right.

Commander Hermes, who was in charge of the second fleet, along with over a thousand of his men had gathered inside one of the largest training rooms.

"Sir, we can’t seem to get any communication through whatsoever. The Dalki seem to be in possession of not just teleport jamming devices but also communication ones!"

Hermes was just shaking his head in frustration. They didn’t know the exact number of Dalki that had boarded the ship, how many spikes they had, nor anything really about the enemy’s equipment.

Information was crucial in any battle, yet they were completely lacking in that department. Should he send too few of his men to deal with the enemy, he would just be sacrificing them in vain. Should he send too many, they would be vulnerable to an attack from sides they would not cover.

At the same time he couldn’t do just nothing.

"We need to prioritise defending the most important parts of the ship! These Dalki need oxygen to survive as well, so the life support system should be safe for the time being. However, I wouldn’t put it past them to sabotage it, if they feel threatened. Hopefully as we travel through the ship we’ll gain a better grasp of the situation."

Hermes then turned to Void and Bonny, who seemed to be in the midst of an argument.

"You two, I don’t want your death to be on our hands. Given the circ.u.mstances it’s too dangerous to leave you behind. Come along with us and try to hide in the back."

The group was prepared to move out and the men had split up into squads with Bonny and Void heading off with Commander Hermes. In theory it should be the safest place for the reporter duo.

"Void turn on your camera. I know we can’t livestream right now but we need to capture everything." Bonny whispered as she was continuing on from the argument before.

"Don’t you feel any fear, Bonny? Sure we’ve filmed lots of stuff in the past but that was mostly scuffles between other factions and families. Nothing like this. The Dalki will tear us to shreds, they won’t care that we are reporters." Void whispered back, annoyed that his partner seemed to prioritise a scoop over their own safety.

Bonny wanted to slap some sense into Void, after all she needed her cameraman, however she understood his fear. Of course she was frightened as well, but she had already prepared herself for something like this. If they were to perish here, at least they should leave something for the sake of humanity!

"Why do you think we came here in the first place? Did you think there wouldn’t be a Dalki attack? This is exactly what we came to film and the people deserve to know! Who knows, our footage may prove very valuable to whoever is coming to save us. At the very least they will find out what’s happened, that’s the least we can do!"

Although Bonny wasn’t talking a lot of sense to Void right now, he took a deep breath.

"When have I ever won an argument against you?" Void sighed in defeat as the little beep from his camera was heard as it was turned on.

His glasses that he used to monitor the drones were turned on as well but none of them was giving him a signal.

Thinking about this, Void was reminded of the person that had let the Dalki on to the ship in the first place. It had been a humanoid figure and the most prominent feature had been the red glowing eyes.

’What if the Dalki aren’t the ones behind the jamming devices, but humans? But who in their right mind would choose to assist them? They would have to have been on board already... could it be that there are even more traitors on board?’

Void wanted to get Bonnie’s opinion on his theory, but at the moment there were far too many eyes and ears around them. What if he was right and one of those traitors was in their midst?

’He knew that I was watching him through the cameras and he decided to pull it anyway.’

"Alright it’s time to head out everybody." Hermes said and at that moment, all of the lights on the ship had shut down.

They were now almost in complete darkness, only able to see a small outline of the people around them and blurs as they moved.

"The lights?Why would they go for the lights. I don’t recall Dalki’s having night vision?" Bonny questioned.

The crew members with the lightning ability activated it slightly, allowing for a soft blue glow in front of them. Their vision was better now and doing something like this didn’t take up too many MC points.

This made it even stranger that they would target the lights.

When it was finally time for Hermes and his group to move forward, around twenty of them started to walk through the dark halls.

Void was lifting up his camera and frantically moving it each time they heard a noise. With the sound of fighting throughout the area it meant he was turning quite often.

Walking through, those at the front heard something, a small splash when they moved their foot down. Void knew what it was straight away. The others moved their sparkling fingers to give them a better view and they could tell it was blood.

"Those damn Dalki seem to have already engaged in combat, we have to go help the others!"

One of the groups that had gone ahead in front of them seemed to have been ambushed. What was strange about their bodies were the wounds. Although the crew members were under the impression that it was the Dalki, Void was able to see more thanks to his camera’s night vision setting. He zoomed onto their bodies and looked at their wounds. The markings on them were too small to be done by a Dalki and even a couple of them had teeth marks on their neck.

He might have not thought much of it, if he hadn’t seen what he had beforehand. Void quickly grabbed Bonny’s hand letting the rest carefully go in front.

It seems like the fear that the Dalki could be around the corner made them forget that they were meant to be looked after.

"Bonny I need to tell you something. Before we were attacked, the one who let in the Dalki, they seemed to be human! Also those wounds... I don’t think the Dalki are the ones responsible." Void shared his opinion with things.

"You think there’s a traitor among us?" Bonny was quick on the uptake.

Pulling his camera up and looking through the lens Void saw what they were going up against. There were two Dalki but they weren’t the only ones attacking.

Putting his camera down and squinting to check if he wasn’t seeing things, he still ended up seeing two humans attack their group, the only discerning thing being that their eyes were glowing red in this darkness.

In the canteen of the ship, several members were trapped in the room with a Dalki. Hiding under tables, and in corners of the rooms, they were shaking, praying for the enemy to not see them without the light.

They tried to hold their breath to decrease the chances of being noticed. This wasn’t like facing any beast, and for a lot of them it was the first time they had even seen the Dalki.

’Hiding is useless!’ One of the Dalki shouted. He, alongside another one-spiked Dalki had remained behind, while the stronger ones had already left to do something else. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Hundreds of innocent humans were in the canteen, hoping for someone to come save them. Wishing that all of this was just a nightmare.

The canteen’s double doors were audibly swung open, and glowing red eyes could be seen floating in the darkness.

’Oh is it time to go already? Can’t we stay a little longer? This is fun!’ The Dalki bellowed in laughter.

The person with glowing red eyes approached one of the Dalki, his hand quickly covered in red aura and spun like a drill. It then slammed into the Dalki’s c.h.e.s.t and went right through its heart.

’I don’t know who you think I am, but I ain’t your friend!’
