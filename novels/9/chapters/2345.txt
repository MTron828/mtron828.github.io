Majestic Desert Splendor

Jessica hadn't been tied up, nor was there someone looking over her. Instead,  she was in the small cockpit of the spaceship along with Magnus. There were times during the flight, where she had imagined sticking her dagger through his neck, she was standing right behind him after all. 

All ideas of that went out of her head though, because if Magnus was this confident to have his back turned, there had to be a reason. Right now, she was more so wondering if Andy was okay. 

'Both Edvard and Hikel turned up, thanks to them everything was sorted out. They were able to save Galanar, so they should be able to save Andy as well. Right now, I need to stick to the plan.' Jessica raised her hand and felt the small bump behind her ear. 

It was the tracking device that Logan had installed. 

'Everything is fine, he hasn't found out about this, when we get to where we need to be, I'll be safe.'

Meanwhile, Jessica noticed that the ship had been going over a vast amount of water for a while now. Wherever they were, it seemed to be far away compared to all the other islands and pieces of land. 

'What's that?' She thought, as she looked to her right and through the window while also placing both of her hands on the glass. She was putting her face closer to the glass to get a better look. 'Is that another ship, all the way out here?' 

She wondered what this place was. She had been living on Earth for a while now and was unable to recall anything being in this area, so why was there another ship? When continuing to look out the window, she soon realised that it wasn't just one ship in the area, there were multiple ones. 

There were ships of different shapes and sizes, and there were some she even recognised. 

'Those ships over there, those are the ones the Vampire Corps units use as well. Why are they all heading toward this island.' 

A bad feeling was overcoming Jessica, as she felt a shiver all over her body. She had no clue what this feeling was. Eventually, the ship landed on the beach of the island. There was a lot of sand, and a little greenery. 

It wasn't large either, from above, she could easily see the whole island, but there didn't look to be any building of any kind at all on it. 

"Where are we going, what are we doing?" Jessica asked. Stepping onto the sand and following Magnus into the jungle area. 

"Do you really think I need to answer you?" Magnus asked. 

Jessica was hoping the others were listening, and by talking, maybe she could get some information that the others needed. 

"Don't you think I should at least know that much, and besides don't you need me to help. Won't it make more sense if you tell me and let me know what we're doing here, in the middle of nowhere, so I can help you?" 

A loud single "Ha!" Sound came out from Magnus. "I don't need your help directly darling, the only thing we needed was you. Do you really think you can escape from me, or this island? You have no chance, you will see everything sooner or later anyway."

They continued to walk, and Jessica was trying to be aware of the surroundings, seeing if there was anything that would stop others from reaching the place where she was at, and as they passed another large tree grouping, Magnus suddenly stopped. 

There still looked like a large number of trees in front of him, but shifting his feet around a few times, in a certain area, the trees started to blur and something else appeared in its place. 

"Was it… some type of hologram!" Jessica asked, her mouth left open in amazement. 

Right in front of her, in the centre of the island, there was a whole open facility. There were computer terminals spread out, people all around in every direction, and in the centre there was a large flat area with a railing around it. 

It almost looked like a battle arena, and was as big as one as well, almost the same size as the coliseum. What she noticed though, was in the large arena-like area, on the ground there were several engravings, symbols and patterns, it almost looked like something drawn out of a magic book.

"You think this is something as simple as a hologram, we wouldn't be so foolish to use something that… that Logan Green could disable." Magnus stated. "There are many things that the world has lost, ancient powers that would use the energy of crystals and the energy that is around us… a world of magic. Even if someone was to fly over this place, all they would see is a simple island. 

"All the spaceships we arrive in, are being broken down and sunken into the sea as we speak. No one would ever be able to find you, not that someone would come looking for you in the first place." 

Jessica noticed something else happening, she placed her hand on her chest. As soon as she entered this area, a surge of power was consuming her. All the people that were around her, every single one of them that were here, and there were at least 200 or so, they were all vampires, and relatively strong ones as well. 

It was causing Jessica's power to fluctuate quite a bit. Most likely, the barrier did more than just change the outside appearance.

Magnus turned around noticing that Jessica seemed to be in a bit of distress. 

"What's this?" Magnus said, as he went up to her, and immediately pulled her head up by her hair. 

She gritted her teeth, and energy was flowing through her. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

"I don't think it's the best idea to touch me now." Jessica said.

"You mean, you think you can beat me?" Magnus tapped the ground, and as he did a strange circle appeared underneath the two. Jessica felt like she could no longer move, and with his other hand, he shoved a pill right down into her throat. 

"That right there should paralyse your body for a couple of hours. It works fairly quickly, and as you said before, we need you alive. So I don't want you to go ahead and try to kill yourslef." Magnus stated. 

Magnus, much like Vincent and Richard, was into research as well. Only he was into researching poisons. He would travel far and wide and planet to planet trying to come up with his own special poisons that would allow him to do a number of things, and this was just one of many he developed just for him.

"We don't need you to do anything in the first place, we just need your powers." Magnus looked right into Jessica's eye and he noticed something, instantly he reached up, and pulled out something from Jessica's eye. 

He was quick, fast and rough, causing Jessica to have massive eye pain, and her eye instantly went bloodshot. 

"What is this, a contact? You were wearing a contact! Ha, and you want this world to still continue on the way it is, when you have to go around pretending to be something you're not, that's brilliant." Magnus said, as he grabbed Jessica placing her body under his arm. 

He then jumped from his position, and landed in the centre circle. Jessica was trying to fight back, she was trying to move, but just as Magnus said, she was unable to feel her body responding to her at all. 

It was a strange sensation, especially considering she could still feel all the rising energy inside her. 

In the very centre, what looked like a metallic bed started to rise up vertically, so it looked more like a door. Jessica was strapped in this time, and locked up just in case the poison started to wear off. 

"Alright everyone, it's time to move into your positions!" Magnus shouted. 

All the workers that had been preparing things so far, started to jump down into the arena-like space, and each of them was standing on a symbol. All of them were looking for a place and then all were facing in the direction of where Jessica was. 

"When the device turns on, all of our power will be extracted from us. In doing so, it will be directed to you Jessica." Magnus explained. "With that, your dhampir power will grow, grow far stronger than any energy you have been able to contain ever before. 

"With this device, the energy will shoot up into the air, opening up a portal to another world, opening up the portal so Immortui can finally join us." Magnus said. "So, let's not waste any more time."

The dream Jessica had, it seemed like it was soon going to become reality.
