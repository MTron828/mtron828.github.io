*****

For a long time, the Shadow Space had been Quinn's safety net. It was a power that was unique even for the shadow itself. He was able to store living things in there, go into the space himself and those that were in the space, reacted differently to the current time that passed outside. 

One of Quinn's big uses for it, that he had used in battle more than once, was to avoid large scale attacks. At the last moment he could enter the shadow space, he would disappear from the enemy's sight and they would know no better as to where he was. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In most cases, they wouldn't have a way to access the space either. When an enemy used a large scale attack just like Ray had used now, it would make it redundant and the opponent would just waste their energy. 

There were a few problems with it though, for one it took some time to enter into the shadow space. So in a lot of cases, if the opponent was fast enough, it was best to just avoid the attack, rather than risk getting hit before entering the space. 

Also, if Quinn wanted to deal damage, it was incredibly difficult to time it so he could enter and leave the space in that way. Regardless, Quinn saw the best opportunity to use it now, and for some reason, it wasn't working at all. 

'This… none of my shadow abilities have been working well, ever since Ray started to use that armour, even my blood shadow seems to have been affected.' Quinn felt like he should have realised sooner, that there was a possibility that his shadow space didn't work. What this also meant, was his other escape like skills such as shadow link wouldn't work in this situation either. 

The fist was coming toward him, everything seemed to be playing out in slow motion for Quinn. He could feel the power of the attack, the second Ray started to gather the energy. Now it was coming towards him, Quinn's mind was going through all the options, all of the possibilities and he was starting to think that this could be the end. 

'This is it, this is how I end up dying, right here, to an all and mighty powerful relative!' Quinn shouted at himself clenching his fists. 'No, there is still a lot I can do…' For a second, Quinn tapped the side of his mask. During the entirety of the fight, particles of blood energy were drawn in from the area. 

For the entire battle, it continued to build up inside the mask. He had used the additional energy, and the converter here and there, but had stopped once he found out that it wasn't doing much against Ray. Still, in his blood attacks he did use the fire attribute to give it more of a devastating effect.

Ray's fist was chucked right toward Quinn's chest and the pure energy of the sword was nearly as large as Quinn's entire body. The power exploded covering the entire area, and continued to strike out far and wide. The powerful attack went through Quinn's body and continued on, to the point where from space, a large sword of a dark orange colour had flashed for just a second before disappearing. 

Ray had his arm stretched out, his wing's still flapping, but he was paused in that position, his stretched position. 'Something… doesn't feel right.' Ray thought looking up. He could see, his hand was pressed against the armour. It was right in the centre of where the phoenix pattern resided, yet there wasn't a scratch on the armour. 

Instead, the armour was lit up in a light blue in colour. It was pulsating strongly. 

"How… even if your armour is fine, how can you be completely intact from that attack!" Ray said, baring his teeth towards Quinn.

In the armour, there was one skill, a safety net that allowed Quinn to receive no damage, to essentially block out one attack, but he couldn't just use it whenever he wished. He needed to be extremely careful about when to use it, because of the cool down.

In turn though, Quinn, knowing the attack was going to be blocked, had readied all of his energy into his hands as much as possible. He threw them both forward and the dragon aura behind his strikes appeared as they went right towards Ray's head. Before they could reach, Ray raised both of his wings. The attack collided with the wings and now they were both pushing against each other. Unlike before, where Ray had fallen to the ground after the attack, the wings were doing just fine. 

"If that attack didn't work, then I'm just going to have to beat you the old fashioned way!" Ray said, as he flew slightly above and punched Quinn on the top of his head.  Quinn hurled toward the ground, crashing and bouncing off it. While Quinn was midair, Ray fell down and with his leg, he slammed it down, hitting Quinn with his heel, pushing Quinn further into the ground and creating a crater that was as large as the city they were in. 

'Crap… crap!' Quinn thought, as blood spilled out of his mouth. He no longer had the shadow, and Ray was far stronger than before. Without the effect of the blood shadow, it seemed impossible for him to win in a one on one fight. The only saving grace was that since he had stopped Ray's ultimate attack, Ray thought he might have a way to stop the attack again. But, he was getting a beat down instead, really better.

Ray reached Quinn, who had yet to recover and picked him up by his foot, he then threw him across the land, until he had reached a large rocky mountain. Quinn's body crashed right through the mountain, creating a large hole. Through that hole, Ray wasn't too far behind trying to strike again. 

With his hands, Quinn created two large blood swords, and held them towards Ray. Not slowing down Ray spun, and with his fists, he punched, breaking the blood sword, and then punched the other in succession, destroying the swords completely. Picking up speed, Ray then grabbed Quinn right by the neck, and was holding on tight.

"You have this strong armour, you have the power of the shadow, but what do you have yourself. What of your own powers do you have that you can use?" Ray asked. Quinn was already putting everything he had into every attack, using all of his Qi, and blood power, so what else could he do. 

'The… demon form?' Quinn thought.

The demon form, Quinn still had no idea what it really did, it wasn't something he could control either, so there was no guarantee that he could be saved by it, but if he was going to die anyway. 

'No Quinn!' The voice said in his head again. 'You don't need to do that….. You still have one more thing you can try. It's ready!'

The voice, now Quinn was sure of it, it was Alex and unlike before Alex was directly talking to him. Why, why was Quinn unable to hear Alex before? The answer was something that Quinn was unaware of and unaware of what was happening.

The power from the mask, part of it was going into the gauntlets, all of the blood energy that was being used, was also going to the gauntlets, because it was yet to be fully awakened. Alex had a brief moment, where he was able to talk to Quinn, but he had yet to reach his full self. Now, that the blood from the mask had gathered enough power and shared enough with it to awaken Alex, it meant one more thing.
