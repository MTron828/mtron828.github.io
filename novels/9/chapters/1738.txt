Chapter 1739: A Diffrent Shadow 2.

Muka was clearly shaken when she saw the person in front of her. After all, she was in slumber for a long time, and although she heard the rumours after she woke up and had even suspected about who the leader of the red vampires could be, there was always a doubt in her mind until this moment.

The result of what had happened to the vampire settlement, the friends and family that she had lost that day, everything was now slowly coming back to her, flashing in her mind like Logan's slides. The others beside her would have asked her what was wrong, but they weren't able to.

Because for some reason, while standing with a smug expression on his face at the centre of the arena, Laxmus was emitting immense pressure. No. one at the scene had ever felt such a pressure before and it was as if the air around them had gotten denser, making it harder for them to even stand.

Some people in the crowd had even instantly fainted from this pressure, and this was beginning to spread panic and fear among many of the crowd because everyone knew this person was dangerous.

"Laxmus, that was the vampire who Quinn fought against, but got escaped at the last second, and this guy also had similar powers as Quinn." Peter thought.

Peter also started to think about the things Quinn had mentioned. And he noticed that the marking on Laxmus's chest certainly looked like a marking that belonged to another celestial.

It wasn't exactly the same as what Peter had on himself, but he could judge what the marking on Laxmus's chest was. In fact, Peter could feel the energy radiating off him, and it was almost as if a celestial was standing in front of them himself.

There is no time for playing games, and I can't continue to disguise myself as the Crazy Bloodlord anymore. It's time to transform and fight with all I have. Peter looked around and noticed that most of the crowd was still in shock, and just then, Logan projected an emergency announcement.

Logan wasn't willing to take any chances. Soon, the black AI robots appeared at the exit, and loud warning alarms went off with lights flashing red.

"Now that's not a nice welcome." Laxmus said, somehow portraying his voice loudly so all the others could hear. It was as if he was speaking through a microphone. "Am I really that much of a threat?"

The AI robots that were left on the field had also gone to protect those in the crowd in case the Red Vampire leader attacked the latter or if there were any stray attacks. As for Jake and Isac, they stepped close to each other, staring warily at Laxmus, wondering what would happen next.

He was surrounded by the strange beasts that seemed somewhat strong, and hopefully, they could solve this all without a fight.

Peter transformed himself and stepped forward. His head-tail came out, the red powers running through his body, and special black hardened scales now covered his arms.

"Why... why do I still feel the burning... and my skin is itching even after transformation."

"Will you look at that!" Laxmus chuckled upon seeing how the others had reacted after seeing him, "I was just after the fake Quinn Talen, but it looks like there is another surprise for me."Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

"I guess this is a good day for me to get more celestial energy for myself. But first, there is something else I need to show you people."

Laxmus glanced towards the crowd from the corner of his eye, and Jake noticed this. Instantly, he jumped in the direction that Laxmus had glanced and had formed a large metallic spear in his hand while he was still in the air.

Then, with his telekinesis power, Jake threw it at an incredible speed, aiming to finish off the red vampire leader.

But before the spear could reach Laxmus's neck, one of the large beasts, a two-headed snake, opened up both of its mouths. What appeared inside the mouths was a seemingly bottomless hole filled with endless shadows.

The spear went right through one of the snake's mouths, and in the next instant, it came out from its other mouth, and went right back towards Jake.

Landing on the ground, Jake stomped the ground and was able to create a thick wall in front of himself and was able to avoid being hurt by his own attack just in time as the spear struck the wall.

"These beasts are annoying, and I might be imagining things, but it looks like they can also use the shadow power!" Jake thought.

It was then that when he looked up over his head, Jake saw another vortex of large shadows appearing right over him, and it was doing exactly what he was afraid of, heading in the direction of the crowd.

"What are you guys doing!?" Jake clamoured at the others in the arena, "We're the most powerful people here, but I'm the only one making a move. Are you people afraid of him?!"

The thing was, the others were indeed fighting back, Even Vicky tried to come down to join the fight, but the shadow beasts reacted, each going towards the other contestants, and now they were struggling against these beasts.

Due to each of them having strange powers and the beasts being stronger than they usually would, this wasn't something they could take care of straight away. However, that was when the shadow successfully engulfed a group of people, covering them completely.

"Haha, that's it! That's it. Feel the burden, feel the pain we have had to deal with for years, and see how you deal with it!" Laxmus shouted.

Eventually, the vortex of shadow rose, revealing the trapped group of around six people. They looked unharmed, with not even a single scratch on their body, but they started to scream in pain a few seconds later.

"AHHH, it HURTS!!! IT HURTS!!!!!"

They were screaming at the top of their lungs, so much that it felt like the back of their throats were cut. Some of the others were even scratching their own skin with their nails until it ripped, trying to do whatever it took to get rid of the pain.

This... Vincent's eyes widened. "I have seen this reaction before... it's the same skill that Arthur used against the vampires, but how can he use it against Humans?"

"Has he somehow altered the power and changed the skill to work against humans?"

It was a shocking thought, and at the same time. Laxmus had done it so easily. Previously, when Quinn used his shadow eater skill against other vampires, they needed to be in a weakened state for it to work. But Laxmus, on the other hand, was able to use the skill on his whim and even against the humans.

Judging by the way Peter keeps looking at his skin. That bear might have done something similar to him. Wights can usually stay in the sun just fine, but he is also suffering the pain from it for the first time.

There was one good thing though, and that was the fact that with the other contestants, Vicky and the others dealing with the beasts, Peter, in his transformed state, managed to run past them all, and he was making his way straight to Laxmus who was still laughing in joy at the pain the humans were in.

He soon noticed the ball of energy coming toward him. Then, without doing much, a large shadow portal opened up a few metres in front of Laxmus, and a giant fist came straight out of it.

It was a solid black, spiralling with strange energy all around it. It wasn't quite a vampire aura, it was hard to be exactly what it was, and the fist was gigantic. The knuckles covered more than the whole of Peter's body.

Unafraid, Peter went to throw out a punch with all his strength. When it hit the giant shadow fist, it didn't budge. Peter could not push forward, and his hand remained there in place.

For the first time in a long time, his strength felt like it had done nothing.

"Everyone has only known the shadow powers of Quinn Talen and Arthur."

"However, I am the original user of this ability, and I have had a lot of time to gather all the shadow I needed to do things that none of you could even imagine." Laxmus spoke.

His smug expression was still the same, if not more intense. He wanted to talk more, but he was cut short when he felt more celestial energy ascending.

Glancing behind Peter, he saw a few others standing there with celestial energy. Muka, Lucia and the rest had descended onto the battlefield,

"No matter what... we have to stop him," Muka said, clenching her fist and taking a fighting stance.

"No one ever wants to fight me on my own. Laxmus smiled. "That's okay because there are many more things the shadow can do!"

Saying this, he spread out his arms, and in the next instant, ten more portals appeared beside him, and out of them, ten other vampires at the lord level had stepped out.

"Greet my Guardians."
