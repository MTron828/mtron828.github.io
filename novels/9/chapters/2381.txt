At the well known hunting grounds, the current scene was one that it had never been before. It looked like a tornado had come through and destroyed everything, including the demons that were on the inside. The energy that had been swirling around in the distance as well as just the general word of mouth had gotten the attention of the Skullys. 

The ones that thought that they were fated for death, that had already lost everything, were now witnessing the dreaded camp. 

All of them, before the hunting games had started, had been dragged to the camp, having to go past the Skullys that had been killed. Then they would be let into the large forest one at a time, with five minutes to run, hide, or come up with some sort of survival plan. 

Yet they all knew that it was useless. Now though, this single person had changed everything. Getting rid of the dreaded demons with their great power. However, their past had taught them not to trust one from the get go. 

There was a good chance that this newcomer could just be another enemy for them to face, and would be even worse than the ones before them.

The only Durum demon that was left alive in the camp was the demon general Lexor, he had yet to attack or do anything, nor answer their questions. It looked like he was ready to fall over backwards but before he did, Quinn swung his fist through the air. 

No one could see what had come out of the fist, but heard a loud explosion. When Anon looked, he saw the general fall to the ground, and one of his legs had exploded. There was no longer a foot where it used to be. 

"If you think I would have any mercy for you guys that create a game out of hunting and killing others, then you are wrong. The fact that you do this willingly and are with Immortui, I already know what you guys are like." Quinn said. 

The punch that Quinn had delivered wasn't just any punch, it was a blood forest punch, the blood was absorbed from the hit into his body, and he was immediately able to feel its effects as it went through him. There was as light cooling sensation through his veins, and almost he could feel it bubbling around his body

[Blood evolution has progressed]

[Blood of Demon general has been absorbed]

'As expected.' Quinn thought. 'I knew the Durum demon was one of the five great races, and after absorbing the last demon general, it looks like I only need to find five demons at the general level to evolve my blood aura even more.'

The main reason why Quinn was happy about this was because the demon generals were no match for him, at least the ones he had met so far, so upgrading his blood aura should be a walk in the park. He also already had an encounter with the Yak type demon as well.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Now, there is a reason why that attack didn't hit your head." Quinn said. "And you should be thankful that you are still alive. I'm not here to change this world, nor am I here to save it. I only want to do one thing, so I need you to give me some information." Quinn said. 

At this point Lexor knew his life was already in Quinn's hands. Sure if the demon king or Immortui found out about this he would be dead, in a way he was a dead man anway. The look on his face said it all and it was as if Quinn knew that. 

With the mask on his face, Quinn started to turn the side of the dial. Small sparks appeared and he soon knelt down with small sparks appearing on his hand. 

"There are a lot of things I can do, and I'm pretty skilled when it comes to controlling blood." As Quinn said this, the blood around from the demon started to rise up in the air, and then moved to his finger tips. Small sparks occur on the blood hitting it constantly until it turned into nothing. 

"I never tried to use my powers in a way to inflict as much pain as possible. I know you demons might not have any emotional feeling, but I'm sure you can feel pain." 

Quinn grabbed the already severed foot, and sparks of red aura left his hand, entering the Lexor's body. From the inside, from his blood vessels and all around his body, each cell, each organ. Blood was everywhere in one's body and Quinn was able to control it all, electrifying every single part. I think you should take a look at

Causing an immense amount of pain, so much that it looked like Lexor wanted to end his life, the only thing was due to the blood shock that Quinn was using, he was unable to use his hands. Quickly though, stopping the blood shock, he started to use his Qi to control the cells ever so slightly in the demon's body. 

It looked like even demons had a life force like energy that Quinn could control somewhat. Using this power, he was able to soothe the pain. 

"I can keep on doing this, or you can answer the question I asked before." Quinn said.

"I am just a lowly general." Lexor said. "I know next to nothing about the demon kings as they never get involved in the affairs of the other, and Immortui might as well just be an imaginary figure, a name that we only all know and see destruction from him once in a while!"

Quinn was getting ready to use his blood shock again, although it seemed like maybe Lexor was telling the truth he needed to make sure, and needed to get everything he could out of him. Seeing this Lexor was quick to speak. 

"I do know of one power… a power that both Immortui and the Demon Kings share." Lexor explained. "The natural energy that is all around us, all over in the air, the energy of the dead. Our universe is sometimes called the land of the dead, but that is not exactly correct.

"The world of the dead is a very real place, but this is not it. However, this world has always been closely linked to the dead. When beings die from all over, they more so turn into a different form of energy, and this is what is in the land of the dead. 

"This universe, for some reason, has always had energy speed into it, the energy that comes from the land of the dead. That is the red mist that covers the planets and the space all around that you see. This energy, it is not meant for the living, and seems to have some sort of effect on them. 

"There is a theory that maybe it was the energy that made the inhabitants the way they were before, before we even came. Regardless, the energy around, it is naturally absorbed into one's body, giving a slight boost in strength but we aren't able to control it. 

"However, for the demon kings and Immortui, they can freely control the energy in this world, and that is what makes them so powerful." 

Quinn knew the energy around them was different, it wasn't like blood aura, but to find out it was this type of energy. Immortui was a god that was closely linked to death, and wondered if it was something related to him, or was it something that occurred before, as they stated.

As Quinn looked at the energy around him, he could see it was reacting. 

'The… demon king that killed the clone… it's coming.'
