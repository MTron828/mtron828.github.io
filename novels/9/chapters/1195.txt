Chapter 1196 Not just one

In the main hall of the ship, those that had learned Qi alongside Nate were busy fighting against the Chained that had come through the portal. They were all thankful for having learned the skill, because without it, they would have been seriously hurt and out of the fight by now.

The strong ability users were able to hurt them, but through the power of Qi, they had managed to reinforce their bodies, lessening the blows that they would receive, in turn using attacks of their own. Of course, on top of that, they also had their own abilities as well.

The problem was, the two groups had been at quite the stalemate, but that was about to change with Burnie Sunshield appearing. He had been hailed as one of the strongest fire users in existence. In almost an instant everyone there had recognised who he was.

——

"For those who don’t recognise him, the one who has just come out should be Burnie Sunshield, he was one of the Big Four that had gone missing during the Civil War. The Sunshield family had been annihilated and no one knew by whom." Bonny reported. "It looks like today we finally got an answer to that. Although they had never been part of it, the Blade family had power rivaling any of the former Big Four, and the Cursed faction are doing everything they can to survive."

The whole world probably was confused by the situation happening at the moment. Only select families knew about the Blade family’s existence, but it was not something the general populace had been aware of. After what Bonny had witnessed last time she had known a few details and it was her job to report accurately on everything that was going on.

That’s when Bonny heard a large bang, coming from another direction of the ship. It sounded far off in the distance.

’Have they managed to infiltrate other places as well?’ Looking around, she could see that there was no sign of the boy they called Sil. It didn’t take much to figure out that the link the Blade family and the Cursed faction shared was due to this person.

"How many drones do you have?" Bonny asked her associate.

"I have four altogether, not counting the camera I’m holding." Void answered.

"Let’s spread them out around the Cursed ship, see if we can find out anything else that is going on. Since we’re already here it’s our solemn duty to show the Cursed faction’s valiant struggles!" Bonny ordered and soon, the drones started to fly up higher, avoiding getting hit as they went around the ship.

——

Burnie’s arms were covered in flames that were constantly spinning like small tornadoes and it didn’t take long for him to figure out which ones would be the best to take out first. Jumping off his short, large legs, a few sparks of flames were left behind and now coming down upon both of them, Burnie was aiming to finish them off with one hit.

Swinging her sword out, Layla was ready to slash right through the flames and bring down Burnie. At the same time, Nate gathered his strength, and threw out his hardened blood fist. However that wasn’t the only thing he had done, before the flames could reach him, the shadow extended from his fist and wrapped around the flames, dwindling them.

’This ability....’ Burnie remembered that he had seen it once before. Still, from his elbows, the fire grew larger and strengthened his fist moving it forward with great speed and both of them slammed into the two from the Cursed faction.

Layla’s blade had managed to get rid of the flames directly touching the sword, but she still felt them go past her hair and face slightly, burning the surface of her skin. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

’What are his hands made of if my blade can’t cut through?’ Layla was surprised, but could see that Burnie had something similar to brass knuckles on his hand. If her blade wasn’t able to cut through it, it meant he had to have similar strength to her.

Even though the black blade had been able to negate the flames, the strength behind the punch had still sent her back quite a bit, tumbling on the floor. As she rolled on the ground, she was quick to get back up.

’Third form!’ The bottom half of her body changed to a serpent, and soon she spat the green fire on her burns by her face and sides. Slithering on the ground, she could get to Burnie quicker. Because Nate had managed to match Burnie’s strength, he was still in the same position as before.

"Haha, I never thought in my dreams I would get to the point where I could match the strength of one of the Big Four, but here I am!" Nate shouted to hype himself up, both hands held out. He had used all his Qi in his body and his shadow ability to lessen the speed of the flames and the flame man’s punch, while the blood hardening protected the outside of his hands.

Both of his legs had sunken deep into the ground, to the point where the flooring panels had been lifted out. The only problem was, he no longer had his shadow to use. Blocking those flames had exhausted nearly all of his MC cells.

Fortunately, he wasn’t fighting alone. Layla appeared behind Sunshield, sure that her flame attacks would be useless against him, she decided to swing the blade towards Burnie’s back.

"Your weapon seems to be able to block my flames, but it can’t block them all!" Burnie grunted, and slammed his foot on the ground. Heat was steaming from his nostrils and in an instant. Fire shot out from his back like a rocket. From the outside he looked like a flaming hedgehog.

The only thing Layla could do was place the sword near her to block most of the flames and cover her body with Qi, but still she was sent back and rolled onto the ground once more, reverting back to her first form.

’We can’t beat him, he’s too strong. I’ll have to take on that form again!’’ Seeing as her friend was struggling, that seemed like the only choice. Layla tried to think back to the fight against Agent 2 and all the hurtful things he had said... but her mind was going blank.

’What’s wrong, why...why can’t I visualise it like I used to?’

"You with the strange red hands." Burnie said, as he grabbed Nate’s fist with his free hand and pulled it apart. Soon, he grabbed the other fist as well. Now the vampire could feel it, that the temperature was rising in both of his hands.

"Arghh!" Nate started to scream, even with the blood hardening, and his Qi, the power was too much for him to handle. It was clear that Burnie hadn’t been one of the Big Four just for show. The fire ability user overpowered the vampire with just his ability alone, but was almost toying with him.

’What is this crap, I can’t just watch as someone dies in front of me, just because I can’t get over my freaking mommy issues!’ Layla was screaming in her head. She could see the negative feeling all around in the room, but still as if a mental block was put on her, she was afraid of absorbing them and turning into that thing again.

Seeing Nate suffer like this, she decided that there was one thing she had to try. She had already tested it on weapons before, but had never attempted to use her powers on a living being.

’I don’t know if this will affect me in any way, but I can’t just let Nate die!’ Layla put on a determined expression as she held out both of her hands toward Nate, and concentrated. It was at that moment that Nate started to feel something aside from the rising temperature. The power in his body was starting to swell. It felt similar to his power, yet slightly different.

’Is this Qi? Just how much power is this?’ Turning his head slightly, he could see from the corner of his eye that Layla was on the floor stretching her hand out. This had to be her doing somehow.

Layla had an abnormally large amount of Qi. Not only her own, but her mother had given her powers that had been cultivated over the years. However, Layla’s body couldn’t handle the enormous strength of power without going to the fourth form.

Still, there was something else she had subconsciously learned to do. Through her telekinesis powers she had been able to infuse items with Qi. She had done so when fighting against Agent 11, powering the broken sword with Qi, to stab through his foot.

Right now, she was doing the same, using her telekinesis powers she was transferring her Qi to Nate. Unlike her, he had a strong trained body in martial arts and was a natural vampire rather than a subclass. Nevertheless, she was worried about the aftereffects this would have on both of them.

Agent 2 had been proof that too much could lead to disastrous effects, but she couldn’t hold back too much either.

Pouring the Qi in his hands, and using the blood hardening he had learned, the pain started to lessen.

"Oi, you pompous piece of flaming crap, you’ve always been the least favourite of the four for me. You always were too hot headed!" Nate shouted as he quickly broke free from Burnie’s grip and grabbed the hands himself. The power was a little too much for Nate to handle and his hands felt like they were going to explode if he allowed it to accumulate anymore.

"If all you can do is hold on to me, then this is useless!" Burnie shouted back as he was ready to push forward once more, until shadows rose up and covered both the hands of Burnie once more. However, these shadow’s didn’t belong to Nate.

"Unlike you and your old bullshit system our Cursed faction doesn’t rely on the strength of just one person!" Dennis shouted, from behind and slammed the black sword he had picked up, through Burnie’s neck. Quickly jumping out of the way, Dennis was expecting a flame attack, but while doing so he threw out a blood swipe and another blood swipe from another direction had come out, hitting the back of the sword pushing it even further inside.

Dennis, had arrived not on his own, but with Megan as back up as well as with Sam. Dennis and Sam both had a strange blue glows on them, courtesy of Layla’s supportive powers.

"How...I was one of the strongest ability users out there...I thought there was only one person who could beat me...how could I have lost just to four nobodies...." Burnie questioned reality, as his breath was dwindling.

"A lot has changed since you have been away. I guess there’s just a lot of strong people now." Nate answered.

Burnie had been defeated, but the fighting was continuing in the ship. Layla had exhausted all of her powers once again, unable to move from the ground, she nevertheless had a smile on her face, for not letting Nate die. Still, it seemed like this time her abnormal Qi had even affected Nate, since he had almost collapsed to the floor instantly as well.

"Megan, Sam we have to get them out of here, and get rid of the rest!" Dennis shouted.

Sam, seeing how much trouble everyone was in, and knowing what the Blades were like, had predicted this. Their shadow powers were strong but it took a toll on them. If someone else as powerful as Burnie would appear, there was no guarantee they could beat them now.

There was no time for rest, but the world due to Bonny and Void had just witnessed something unbelievable happen. Something beyond their understanding, and it looked like there was more to come, as the drone had entered a training room, where two humanoid beasts were facing off against the Blade family twins.
