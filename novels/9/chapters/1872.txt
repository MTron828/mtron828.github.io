Chapter Ôªø1873 Vampire Vs Werewolf (Part 2)

For a long time, Quinn had been focusing on his blood powers, his celestial powers and more, trying to figure out the different ways he could use them. Since he couldn't exert his celestial powers properly, it left him with no choice but to use his powers in a physical sense. That led him to improve his hand to hand and close quarter combat abilities.

Fighting with blood aura was handy when fighting against multiple enemies at once, but it just didn't cut it when he was fighting a strong enemy like Athos. In the future, there was a possibility that Quinn would be going up against someone like Athos without Sil around.

If that was the case, then Quinn needed to figure out some other aspect that he could evolve, and while creating his own space he had mainly focused on improving his shadow powers.

'The shadow power is meant to be a god slayer ability, but it has never felt like that, but Arthur‚Ä¶ he had created a lot of the moves, and even created the Shadow Eater skill to punish vampires. Which means there are more ways to use the shadow‚Ä¶ I just needed to learn them.' Quinn thought.

In his hand, it looked like a condensed form of the shadow, but it wasn't, as it was constantly shifting somewhat similar to his shadow body. When using shadow overload and fighting with his shadow body, the shadow had slightly different properties and Quinn had decided to explore this.

On the other side, Chris was cautious of these new types of weapons he hadn't seen before, so he decided to attack from further away, getting up close only when he needed to. Swinging out his arms constantly, Chris sent out slashes through the air one after the other.

Seeing this, Quinn then got his scythe ready, and started to spin it, slashing through the attacks and breaking them one after another. After breaking the initial series, Quinn moved to the side and had gathered a red ball of aura in his left hand where the shadow was, and threw it out towards Chris.

Chris could tell that this was an explosive and powerful attack and he whacked it away covering his hand with Qi into the air. A few seconds later, the red aura had exploded in the air, dyeing the sky red for a few seconds.

However, that was just to allow Quinn to get close as he was already by his side swinging the scythe towards his side. Moving quicker than Quinn, Chris had grabbed the back edge thinking he had stopped it, but he hadn't at all.

The soul weapon blood scythe had the ability to use the blood forest, in fact all of Quinn's blood armour could. Blood moved from the scythe and hardened into several spikes shooting out to hit Chris straight in the head.

Using his great strength, that outmatched Quinn's, he pushed the scythe upward which moved the small hardened blood trails, but they were still going towards him. At the same time, Quinn slammed his foot into the ground, and blood aura filled the cracks.

Knowing something was up, Chris quickly leapt up in the air and threw Quinn's scythe into the ground. Blood had risen from the ground in the form of little spikes and branches as the blood forest attack was used, but it had hit nothing.

While in the air, Quinn had changed the Scythe into a spear and threw it towards Chris. Seeing this before, Chris was ready to grab it once again and throw it back, but while it was mid air, its shape started to change, and it began to form into almost a deadly tornado. It reached the clouds turning them red as well.

The next second the entire tornado had engulfed Chris's body. Constantly he was being hit by attacks that were similar to that of the blood swipe from all over. He was unable to fall down as his body was being hit from below and everywhere was being ripped to shreds.ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

As fast as he was being cut and hurt though, his body was keeping up with the healing process as well.

As the anger started to rise in Chris, and the pain started to build up, he just began to attack the tornado. Swinging his arms out, creating breaks in the red attack, but it soon healed up.

'I need to move faster, I need to attack harder!' Chris thought in his head, as he continued to swing, he was slowly getting faster. His movements were breaking up more of the tornado that seemed invincible, and he didn't have to worry about the attack because it didn't hurt him at all.

Lifting both of his hands, Chris struck beneath him and the entire tornado had disappeared. What Chris didn't expect was that right after the tornado had disappeared, Quinn was already directly in front of him, with one red gauntlet soul weapon hand and one shadow hand.

The red armour was no longer on his body, and he had switched to his demon tier blue fang set.

'Just for a moment, I need to be faster than you.' Quinn thought, as he already had thrown out his fist, and had punched Chris in the stomach. As soon as he had hit Chris once, he continued to hit Chris again and again, all over his body.

As he did this, shadows were being left on Chris's body, attached to him, as if they were small fires that were burning on his body. Quinn didn't stop punching as he threw hit after hit constantly on him.

"You think your weak punches can do anything!" Chris shouted as he threw his own fist, sending Quinn back down to the ground. A loud bang was heard and had rippled the air several times, and less than a second later another bang was heard as Quinn had crashed into the ground and sunken into it.

"You have a lot of tricks up your sleeve, and your very versatile with all your powers," Chris said, as he landed back on the floor. "But that means nothing when you are fighting against someone who is faster, smarter, and is all around just better than you."

Crashing up through the ground, Quinn came out with his armour crumbling to pieces and falling to the ground. The blue fang set had lasted him a long time. He knew it was a risk using it in this fight, and with someone like Chris that it possibly would be destroyed.

The other demon tier chest piece had been destroyed but had a passive effect of healing itself again if it was damaged, but that wasn't true for the blue fang set. It was practically useless now, and was to be lost forever.

'Helen the gift that you had given me has saved me more times than I could ever count, and it's true to that now. I'm sorry I never really appreciated your feelings at the time, and I'm sorry I never really got to say thank you to you.

'But, just like all those other times before, your gift has not been wasted.'

Quinn held out his shadow hand, and pointed it towards Chris from a distance. All over Chris's body, there were still parts of the shadow on him, he was currently more shadow on his front than his actual body.

"I don't know if you have ever felt fear before," Quinn asked. "But I guarantee that you will feel it now."

Twisting his hand, the shadow all over Chris's body started to expand and spread. The small dots had attached to each other and started to grow rapidly.

Chris tried to use his Qi to fight it off, he even started to punch his own body trying to get the shadow off him, but he was unable to do anything. Then finally, all of the dots of shadow had been connected and the entirety of Chris's body was covered in shadow, and there was only a shadow body of Chris that could be seen.

'What happened‚Ä¶ I can't see anything‚Ä¶ I can't hear anything, or taste or smell... All of my senses have completely disappeared.'
