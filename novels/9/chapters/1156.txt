Chapter 1157 Project: Evolve

Looking at the files, Logan was checking through all of the information. The main problem was that it was pretty lacking. It seemed the military was quite careful about not linking systems. So if there was a breach, a single person wasn’t able to access all the files.

’This might be due to people who have abilities like me. In this case, not even my back doors work out for this type of stuff.’

With no more information being gathered from the current room he was in, Logan decided that it would be best that he head off to the place where the legendary tier humanoid beast was meant to be located.

Before leaving himself, with his spiders still down the hallway, he allowed them to locate where the room was first. Now having access to the map of the facility, it was easier to navigate and eventually, his spiders had reached the room. Once they entered, Logan was filled with confusion at what he could see.

’Is that real? Without just the spiders, I won’t be able to access any information from the terminals. I will need to enter the room for myself, but what could have happened there?’

Trying not to waste time, Logan sent out his spiders on a different task. They were to head to each room, where a beast was meant to be held captive. It looked like a lot of the beasts they captured were going to be used for bate. However, the others, those being experimented on, were in a different area. Which was good news for him since he was currently on the second floor with the experiments, and there weren’t many people out and about on this floor?

Each room had the beast present. There was even one room that contained a king tier humanoid beast as well. Which was interesting. Suppose all else failed, as long as the intelligence was still there and Shiro could move human minds into them. Despite what tier it was at, they could use the humanoid beast to place Vorden or Raten inside.

Of course, half of Quinn’s idea to use Demi-god tier beast or higher was the fact that they would still have strong power. Being in a beast, they would no longer have the powers they once had before.

’What Quinn never considered was the fact that the beasts can evolve.’ Logan thought as he stood outside the door where the legendary tier beast was meant to be. Getting inside, it was as easy as the last door, and now he could see the place with his own eyes.

’So what the spiders sent me was real.’ Logan thought, looking at the scene in front of him. The whole lab, compared to the other one’s, was destroyed. It looked like they had a strange circular container that was centred in the middle.

The front half of it had been ripped apart and chucked to the side, then there were several containers on the outside as well, with glass on the floor. On top of that, nearly everything else in the room had been ripped apart or destroyed, but one terminal remained, the one that was required for the door to be opened.

’Let’s hope there is still some information that I can gather from here.’ Pressing his hand on all the terminals, Logan was able to extract some information, but a lot of it was unretrievable. With the odd bits of information he did obtain, he did learn of something. The beast that was contained here was the first project they were working on.

It was the oldest compared to all the other experiments.

’I thought that they started experimenting on the beast to find a way to get rid of the Demi-god tier beast, but the reports don’t match up. This beast was captured way before the Demi-god tier even started appearing.’

Searching for more information, Logan knew there had to be something here since this was the first experiment, perhaps the reason why they were doing this in the first place. Then finally, he had found two vital pieces of information.

One was a recording of what happened on the last day of the experiment. There were no more dates after this, and the other was why they were running these experiments in the first place.

’That’s what the facility was being used for? It was a project to upgrade the beasts to create stronger crystals. They were trying to find the most effective way to make the beast evolve to create stronger weapons.

’It makes sense since, for one, demon tier beasts are hard to come by and very dangerous to kill. Even if they couldn’t make a beast evolve to the Demon tier level, it is still an improvement for the army to have anything legendary tier and above.’

In all honesty, Logan couldn’t fault them for what they were trying to do. They were just trying to use what they had to their advantage. Although it was cruel for the beasts in a way, what choice did humans have? They were in a desperate time, and if they didn’t do this, their lives would be in danger.

Next was to play the video, and now finding this out and putting the pieces together, Logan had a pretty good idea of what happened that day.

The video started to play, and it was an exact replica of the room Logan was in, only that everything hadn’t been destroyed yet. In the centre of the room was a circle machine where the beast could be seen inside. It was hard to make out precisely what it looked like due to where the cameras were positioned.

On the outside of where the beast was, there were several glass displays with crystals floating about inside. A tube above it all redirected to the beast in the centre. Suddenly, all the crystals on the outside started to light up simultaneously. One of the doctors standing in the middle had a smile on his face.

When the lights from the crystals disappeared, the beast in the pod started to light up brightly. Shining so hard that all of them had to cover themselves.

"Finally, we did It! We managed to evolve a Legendary tier humanoid beast into a Demi-god tier beast!" The man dressed in white said. A few seconds later and there was a rumbling that had come from within the centre container. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Several loud bangs were heard after, and the look of panic appeared on the scientists’ faces as they took a step back. The next second, the door was ripped off and thrown all the way to the side.

When Logan looked at where the door had landed, he could also see that the door was still in the same place. Unfortunately, from that moment onwards, the video footage was corrupted, and Logan was unable to see more.

’The date on this video. It’s only been a month since this happened. It was so soon. Is that why the room still hasn’t been repaired yet? And if my guess is right. The humanoid Demi-god tier beast that the scientist and Pure are after is the Demi-god tier beast from this facility.’

Exiting from the room, it was quite the revelation that Logan had found out, but it didn’t really change anything. They still needed to get the Demi-god tier beast for themselves. However, Logan wasn’t ready to leave the facility yet.

Not all beasts could evolve, and it looked like they had found a way to determine which beasts could evolve. Perhaps this information could be used to help Borden, Raten and Vorden.

After getting all of the information, Logan realised that there was one thing he needed more to figure everything out. He needed to take a subject back with him. Which was why right now, he had moved from the destroyed room where the Demi-god tier beast was kept and was currently in the room where a King-tier humanoid beast could be seen.

The beast could be seen behind a large glass wall. When Logan entered the room, its eyes locked onto him. Following his every move.

’Is it acting this way because its never seen me before?’ Logan thought.

The beast had a humanoid figure but was covered in black fur. Its eyes were piercing red without any white area. On top of that, it had several tails coming out from its behind that were large and fluffy. They could be seen extending to the top of its head.

’It will take too much time to look for another Demi-god tier beast. I can use this one to research how to know which beasts can evolve and which can’t. At the same time, we can just evolve this one.’ Logan thought as he went to the terminal and placed his hand down.

Here he had access to many different options, one of them allowing for a special type of gas to enter the glass room the beast was in. The gas was pink in colour and filled the room until the beast itself couldn’t be seen.

When the gas finally disappeared, the beast was seen on the floor lying down.

’Now, just need to take this someplace safe. I think it might be best to get back and hand it to Fex. We can try to wrap the beast up. With his strings and my equipment, we should be able to hold it.’

Activating another button, the glass door started to rise. Walking over to the beast, before he knew it, its red eyes shot open and stared right at Logan.

"Thank you for letting me out!" The beast said.
