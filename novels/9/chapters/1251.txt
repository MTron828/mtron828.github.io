Chapter 1252 - Stronger Than Before

Although it was easy for Quinn to remove the effects of the Blood addiction, it still took some time for him to complete the process for each flask. While doing so, he was thinking about the best way he could allocate his stats.

Most people’s blood type in the world generally had the O blood type. The good thing was that this particular blood type would give Quinn a free stat to use as he wished. Different blood types after consuming so many of the same blood type, would give him a stat in a specific area.

’Before every time I would level up, I would try to get my stats as even as possible. I thought being fast was just as important as being strong, and having the stamina to keep on fighting was as important as strength. However, after getting the legendary beast gear, things changed a bit.

’The stats gained from the set focused mainly on speed. Adding a few stats to my base points here and there isn’t really going to affect my speed much. I thought my strength was strong enough, but not enough to pierce the skin of a five spike. This time I know where to put the stat points.’

The penalty of course, still had affected Quinn. He had five fewer stats in every category, and if he was to do this, he still would have five more, but learning from the fight, he would now focus on putting his free stat points into strength.

In the end, after drinking the blood from all the five flasks, Quinn in a way, was actually at a stage where he was stronger than before the penalty.

[Strength 83]

[agility 72]

[Stamina 72]

[Charm 55]

Quinn realised that each flask had continued roughly the same amount of different blood in each of them. However, he would get fewer stat points from each one, as obtaining stats from blood was getting harder and harder.

His strength had been boosted beyond what it was before, while his agility and stamina were a little under what he had in the past. Hardly noticeable. The only stat that Quinn didn’t bother to increase was his charm stat.

In the past, he had gotten it up to the sixty mark, but with the opponents, he was fighting and the position he was in, there really was no need for him to use the influence power to such a degree anymore. The only way to also obtain a charm point was through a free stat by consuming the O blood type, and strength was a priority.

’This is amazing. Maybe I should start going to the Cursed factions and ask Helen and the others to do the same when I arrive. I’m sure they would understand, right?’ Quinn thought.

’It might cause some worry." Vincent said. ’I’m not saying that it will, but in the past, a long time ago, history states that there was a time that some vampires and humans tried to live together by doing such things, but it never worked out. Perhaps it will be different with you because you only require a drop of their blood and only once.

’Although I’m sure questions will arise with what you are doing with that blood between them. At the same time, your stats are properly close to their limit if I was to guess. Just like in the past with the previous evolutions, your stats stopped growing at a point.’

Taking Vincent’s word, Quinn thought he might be right. Would it be worth maybe upsetting this in the Cursed faction for a few extra stat points?

’Still, it’s got to be better than death. Maybe I should just ask Helen to prepare it beforehand. It still takes a few hours for me to go through the process and get rid of the effects of the blood addiction.’

Speaking of a few hours, Quinn just realised how long he had spent in his personal training room and was sure that the others would be ready for filming any second now.

——

The filming was to take place in the main Cursed ship hall, which had been cleaned up and down, scrubbed until it was sparkling. Decorations even filled the halls, with flowers and paintings Quinn had never seen aboard the ship before. Quinn was surprised at how much they had done while he was away.

Sniffing the air a few times, Quinn could still smell it though.

"They can clean the room, but they can’t exactly get rid of the smell of blood that easily, can they?" Fex said, coming up from behind.

Fex wasn’t the only one in the main hall. A lot of the Cursed faction members had been invited inside the Cursed ship main hall. It was getting quite packed.

"I thought this whole thing was just going to be a quick video." Quinn looked at the crowds of people and excitement on their faces. There was even a stage that had been built. It reminded Quinn of the other ceremonies he had attended, such as the crowing of the vampire king.

"Apparently, Bonny said it will look more like an award ceremony with more people inside. It’s got to look good for the public, ya know." Fex patted him a few times.

On the stage, Sach was standing there along with others, and it looked like they were going through a dress rehearsal. By his side was a holographic display of Samantha. Quinn would be ’giving’ the sword to Samantha while actually handing it to Sach on stage.

"Hey, how was she?" Fex asked.

Quinn was wondering who he was talking about, and followed where Fex’s eyes were looking. He could see he was staring at Samantha.

"Oh, you’re actually worried about her. That’s a surprise? I didn’t think she would exactly be your type. Isn’t she a lot older than you as well?" Quinn questioned.

"24, there’s only around a 6 year difference, some people I know have hundreds of years of difference, and it still doesn’t matter," Fex replied.

Quinn often forgot that Fex actually came from a different world. Although they were of a similar age, what was ordinary to him and ordinary to others was just two different things.

"Honestly, she seemed determined..but also something was still a little off," Quinn remembered back at the meeting. Although she had allowed them to have the sword, it didn’t seem like it was because she wanted the Cursed faction to have it, but because she was undeserving of it.

"I think she could do with someone by her side," Quinn said. "If you can hit it at the right moment and actually talk to her like you care about her, unlike all those other girls you talk to, maybe you two can hit it off."

"Hey, the day I start taking love advice from you will be the day you become the vampire king." Fex jokingly replied, thinking that both things were doubtful.

——-

Before the filming began, Quinn was instructed by Sam on everything that needed to be done. The main people that needed to be seen on camera were up on the makeshift stage, and the crowd watching were told when to cheer and clap.

It was different compared to when Quinn was being filmed before, but at the same time, there was less pressure on himself. This was because unlike all the other times he was on camera in the past, this was not going to be live. Bonny told Quinn that he could relax, and they could edit out whatever they needed to.

After filming for a short while, Void and bonny could be seen conversing with each other.

"He wasn’t in the rehearsal, was he?" Void asked.

"No, he just came now, and Sam told him everything that needed to be said. We have been able to do nearly everything in one take." Bonny replied.

"Well, I was checking out the script that we gave to him as a guideline. I didn’t expect him to, but he’s been able to repeat the words exactly as they were written one by one. If what you are saying is true, he must have an incredible memory and be a really quick learner."

Hearing this, Bonny looked at Quinn and remembered the words that he, or at least someone, had said to her as she left. That she should give up on him.

’Who could give up on someone like him.’ Bonny thought.

The Demon tier weapon being used was the real one, and the handling of the Demon tier sword was done so to Sach. Soon after, Samantha gave a speech about how thankful she was. Then it was Quinn’s turn.

Walking up to the stage, he was meant to say a few words about Oscar, but a message sounded in his head just as he did.

’This is an important message, being sent out to all those in the Tenth family. A council meeting has been requested. I repeat a council meeting has been requested. Please come to the meeting or send a proxy in your place.’

The message was sent through telepathy, and looking out in the crowd, Quinn could tell that Fex had received the news as well. The voice was familiar, and without a doubt, it was from Jil.

’A message from the vampire world, and to come back? What is going on?’ Quinn thought.
