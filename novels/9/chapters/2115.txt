The others watching the simulation were standing behind Quinn. They could see both of his hands shaking, and not a single one of them dared to say a word, nor did they approach him. While on Earth, and most of the time Quinn was with the others, he would be in a constant state.

He was always suppressing his energy so it was unable to leak out, so others not on the planet, those nearby, and of course the celestials as well wouldn't know about him and would not know where he was, but this time, with what he could see for a second he couldn't help it, and it broke through for a second.

'Borden… this is how you meet your end?' Quinn thought. It was disgraceful.

To die in battle, against an enemy that he perhaps knew nothing about. Jack Truedream was an enemy that was created due to him obtaining the shadow, due to his mess with Erin trying to hide her, and the Blade family.

Borden had been with the group a number of times, he had helped Quinn out on Blade island, perhaps even saved his life, and helped the others fight Erin when she had her own memories changed.

More than that, there were countless times where Borden would refer to Quinn as his brother, because after the small scuffle they had, he really felt like they were brothers. The connection they had and all the journeys they had been through together made it feel like so.

After waking up, Quinn had never gone to the Blade's ship. He had been far too busy, involved with other things, and he hadn't had the chance to meet Borden either, yet here he was now witnessing his end.

All of it was very painful for Quinn, too painful for him to bear, so he had paused the simulation and just like that everything had frozen.

After a few minutes, he was starting to regain his composure slightly and walked up to where Borden was, his face was already slightly melted, at least the top half anyway, but even then, in his last moments, there was a smile on his face.

'How… in a situation like this can you be so happy, how can you be so positive?' Quinn thought.

There was no need to play the simulation, Quinn knew there was no coming back from it, even for a Dalki, getting one's head melted like so, his arms limp, it was the end.

"As long as I am alive, I will continue to remember your face, and I promise that I will tell everyone what you have done."

When saying these words Quinn was reminded of the reporter AJ, who had asked to follow Quinn. He wanted to record the current moments, the past moments and more and place it all in a book. Once his story was done he was going to spread everything.

Quinn had put a mental note, to make sure to sit down with AJ, and if the book was ever to come out, that details of everything that Borden did was remembered.

After, Quinn said a few words almost like a prayer along with the rest of his family and the others he turned his head to look at H. He ingrained the details of the Dalki in his head. From the results how the world came to be like it was, and how it was going so far, Sil did not win this fight, and H was very much still alive.

So Quinn wanted to pay back the person that caused this all.

'Not just Jack, and Jim, but it looks like another one has been added to the hit list.'

———

The simulation restarted from that moment, after Quinn was ready to watch what happened again, and he could see it. Sil, so immersed in the task of defeating H, was unable to see what was really happening in front of him.

All of his simulations, or foresight was showing what was to happen if he was to attack a certain way, but the problem was, Sil wasn't attacking after finding out that it would fail, and he had failed to see the very outcome that had occurred.

The entirety of Borden's head was reduced to nothing, and his body felt the floor. A wave of different attacks had come out from the other clones, all aimed at H, but with his super speed along with his natural speed, he moved out of the way of the attacks, and went straight to the real Sil.

With the book in his hand though, Sil had selected the teleportation ability, and blinked away, in front of H eyes leaving him to hit nothing but the air, but the powerful attack still distorted the whole space.

It was a heavy punch, that distorted the clouds in the sky when the attack hit, easily destroying anything in its path. Watching this, it reminded Quinn a lot of Ray's punch as well.

Shiro and the other Blades watching near the Blade ship were all in pain as they saw Borden on the floor no longer moving. Some felt like it was a dream. Borden had been with the Blades for a long time, as one of the leaders.

He had helped on a number of occasions, and here they were, all standing around doing nothing.

'Sh*t why do we have to be stuck in here, unable to do nothing!' Raten screamed inside Shiro's head.

Vorden was silent, still taking it in, whereas although Shiro was affected, he was more worried about what the outcome of the rest of the fight would be.

'Sil… will lose this fight.' Shiro said to the other two.

'What do you mean?' Raten replied back angrily. 'Although Sil hasn't damaged the other one, I still think the fight is fairly even, they can't hurt each other… Sil will find a way.'

Raten and Vorden both had an idea of what Sil was doing with the book. Based on the enemy they could see in front of them, Sil was coming up with the best way to beat him. After all, there was a difference between H and Sil even if both of them could use the same amount of abilities.

Sil could change his abilities, and counter the ones H currently had. Just like then with the super speed, Sil could continuously teleport out of the way. Water beat fire, earth against lighting and so on. So why was Shiro saying Sil would lose?

'Do you not remember what Sil said to us… before this mess started. He whispered in our ear, that if he ever thought the situation was too tough… that he would make sure that we were all okay. I think you're right, if Sil was to fight with all his power and continue to fight there would be a way.

'But from the beginning he has been protecting us from the blasts from the ship above, and has been fighting against the Dalki before. Even if he has a lot of MC cells, he doesn't have an unlimited amount.

'Based on his words, what do you think he meant by that?' Shiro asked.

It suddenly clicked in the other's heads, there was a way to make it so the others would survive no matter what, and before they knew it, Sil had teleported right next to Shiro along with the others.

"I'm sorry, I wasn't strong enough to beat him… I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough to save Borden. All of you, you have to live, you have to continue the Blade family, right the wrong of our name, and… even though I failed. I know there is one person who won't. Stick to Quinn and find him!"

Sil didn't give a chance for the others to say anything, as he placed his hand on the ground, and before they knew it, a mass teleportation of the entire Blade family had occurred, all of them were gone. They were no longer on the planet and Sil was now there on his own.

Sil had used his powers to transport them far away, a place where maybe even he didn't know, a place where Jack was unable to attack them. If he was to teleport him and H, then it would mean the rest of the Dalki and Jack would still be able to fight them.

Teleporting H away, they still would need to deal with Jack as well, and it wasn't getting rid of the root of the problem. At the same time Sil felt like the reason they were here was because they were after him.

As long as Sil wasn't with the others then no one had to die, at least no one else had to die.Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Which was why he had made the decision, but mass teleporting so many people, so far away had taken a large amount of his MC cells.

The fight that could have gone either way, by making sure the others were safe with100 percent certainty, had now tipped in H's favour.

———

"The footage that can be obtained ends there." A familiar voice said, Logan. "Based on what you saw, you might be worried about what happened to Sil, but fear not, he is alive, and I know exactly where he is."
