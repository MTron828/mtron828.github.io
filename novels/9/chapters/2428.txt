It had been a long time since Xox had done something like this, walking among so many lives around him. He had spent so much time in the celestial space, after which spending time only with Yongbu, that everything felt somewhat foreign to him. 

Not just that, but he also felt a little uneasy due to the looks he would get once in a while, it wasn't just the looks though, it was the fact that all of these beings were superhuman. 

He saw them sprinting past him from one area to the next. Some would just jump over houses if they wished to get to the next street over. There weren't a lot of fights though, just as the leaders had explained. 

Guards were constantly on patrol and they would appear, seemingly out of nowhere, if there were any signs of trouble, even small disputes.

'No wonder this is a group of people that Mundus was keeping an eye on, and now, the Ancient Ones want to keep an eye on Quinn as well. Either way I need to complete the task.' 

Asking around the settlement, the vampires were happy to answer the general questions the guest had. Of course, the questions he had on his mind were about Quinn. He firstly asked if they had seen the leader recently or knew where he was. 

Then, he would ask what he was doing the last time they had seen him, as well as if there was anything weird. If the Ancient One called him again, he wasn't going to have completely no information to give him. At least this way it looked like he was doing some work. 

After asking about ten or so people, Xox was starting to get an idea of the situation. 

'So no one has actually seen Quinn for a while now. It seems like they all believe he is away doing some task as well. Although the information is different from person to person. There's been no official announcement of what he is doing, only that he's away.'

It was quite surprising that no one would know what Quinn was doing at all, but none of them seemed bothered by it. There were a few other strange comments though, particularly about how he had been acting strangely in the last week or so when they had seen him. 

Not in a bad way, but just that they felt like it wasn't the usual way Quinn was acting. 

'Not acting like himself? Am I on to something here, the fact that he was acting strangely and then disappeared, means he must be up to something. 

'That BB, if he has the attention of the Ancient Ones, it has to be for a reason.'

Although Xox was an information gatherer, he knew nothing about Quinn being an agent for the celestials, or the God-slayers he had defeated. Due to the crystals being used to create the armour, it was a secret to be kept from everyone. If anyone had known of those he had defeated, then there was a good chance, even if the request was from an Ancient One, they would try not get involved with a being of that power.

Although Quinn was strong, Xox still felt the consequences from the Ancient Ones 's were far more frightening. 

'I guess that only really leaves me one choice then.' Xox thought. 'I have to stick to the original plan and try to ask his family. If I remember correctly Yongbu talked about him having a daughter.' 

Simple information had been gathered by his friend, along with a warning, but not much other than that. Yongbu was too embarrassed to go into details of what had happened back then. If Mundus didn't interfere it was quite possible he would have lost his life.

Walking through the settlement, Xox was in the marketplace, as he had no idea where to go, but thought it would be the best place to gather information. He wasn't shy talking to the others. 

It wasn't something celestials really felt, because these were just lives in front of him, those that would come and go, and it was why it was easier for him to speak his mind as well. 

Asking around, he asked if there was any school nearby, it would be the most likely place to find Quinn's daughter. His excuse was that he wished to see how the future of the vampire settlement was run so he could pass on the knowledge to the Mermerials as well, and they were all happy to tell him.

Reaching the school was easy, and getting past the guards was easy for him as well. Everyone was well aware that they had visitors coming. An announcement was made to the settlement informing everyone to be extra careful today.

When they had heard who had entered, two teachers who were currently off duty quickly went to greet Xox and showed him around the school. They were walking around explaining how the school worked showing him the hard working students in the classes. 

Meanwhile, Xox just had to nod along, until he eventually asked the question he wanted to.

"Thank you for taking your time to explain everything." Xox said. "I was wondering, I was told that the Hero Quinn's child went here. You see, at one point she actually lived among the Memerials and the two of us got along well with each other, so I would like to see her if possible." 

The truth was Xox didn't even know what she looked like, so they might have even passed her while going past the classrooms. 

"Sure." One of the teachers said, and willingly walked Xox through the hallway. They could stare through the glass looking into the classroom, and the teacher clear as day pointed out to her. 

"Excellent." Xox smiled.

With the tour over, Xox had decided to leave the school, and when heading down a dark alley, his whole body started to change and transform. He was going from one of the Mermerials turning into another vampire. 

Even the outside clothing was actually a part of his powers. He waited outside, looking ahead at the school. 

"Now, all I need to do is wait for school to end, and approach her somehow. I wonder, what's the best way?" Xox thought 

He started to walk out of the dark alleyway, out towards the school. As he took one step forward just and he was about to exit out of the alleway though, a large circular shadow had appeared right in front of him. 

Taking a step forward he had moved too far. The whole area was dark around him, it was black all around, and turning around he could no longer see the alleyway, nor could he see any of the settlement. 

"What… is going on?" Xox thought. 

"You…" A voice said.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Turning around again, now Xox could see a small boy with black hair, who looked to be about 2 to 3 years old at most. 

"You." The boy said again. "Bad person."
