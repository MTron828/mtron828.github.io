Chapter 1165 Discovering another way

Lying on the floor, Quinn’s body felt a little strange. It was the first time he was experiencing something like this. He carefully pushed his body up and used the nearby wall as support. His leg was still bleeding, but the far bigger problem was the wound on his shoulder that was still present.

Quinn gathered up the Qi in his body to try and deal with it. Since he had learned the second stage he was able to move it around freely. Having helped Owen and Layla recently also made for quite the good experience in expelling foreign energy.

The weirdest thing about it though was the feeling he had. Quinn could tell that all the energy in his body was activating, it was constantly trying to heal him, yet the strong powerful Qi inside him was stopping that process. It was as if both types of energies were clashing against each other.

This wasn’t the first time he had been injured by a Qi attack, but none had been so powerful to cause such a change in his body. It was a good thing one of his arms was still in good condition. Even though he didn’t need them to use his Qi, it helped him visualise the healing.

Hovering his hand over his shoulder, he began the process, and started to reflect on the fight that had just taken place.

’I should have been more prepared. Layla already warned me that Pure was being led by a high-ranking single digit Agent. I already fought with Lucy, so why did I assume she would be the only one who could block out my shadow powers?! This guy was even more powerful than her. She was never able to do something to that degree like the man did, and what was up with that strange red form? The energy that was coming off him was like a soul weapon.

’My blood attacks weren’t strong enough and Qi really is a vampire’s worst nightmare other than the sun. I might have been royally screwed without my Qi. My blood powers were useless against him and somehow he managed to overpower me in a physical fight.’

After removing the foreign Qi from his body, he consumed blood from his Blood bank and the healing took place as it should have. Thinking about what happened earlier Quinn looked towards his silver gauntlet.

’Maybe I can use this thing more. It might help me out and power my ranged attacks. Getting close to someone like him seems suicidal without my shadow powers.’ Quinn thought as he looked at the damage that was done to his leg and soon got to work on that as well.

As he stood there with shaky knees, Quinn decided to use his Inspect skill for a second time. It was quite the strange sight to see but he was wondering if he could spot something.

However, he was shown the same result as did the first time. The room was just full of dead beasts, not a single one was alive.

’It looks like the Demi-god tier beast has already been to this area and is no longer here. Does that mean it’s gone to one of the other areas instead?"

Once Quinn’s leg was fully healed, he was nearly back at a hundred percent. The Qi energy he had used would take a while to be restored, which was the only downside, but his blood powers and shadow were fully replenished.

’That Pure leader should have used a lot of Qi in our fight, and even with his freaky physique he should feel the effect soon.’

Quinn looked back at where he had come from, the place was sealed up with rocks. The tunnel was completely caved in. Although Quinn could properly try to punch his way through he was afraid that would just cause more rocks to fall and possibly create a cave in for the entire area.

’If I got split up to this side, the Pure members are on the other side. There’s a good chance that they’ll run into the others. I have to find a way out of here.’

Searching around the empty room Quinn was looking for any way out but he was struggling to find one. If worse came to worse he could use his shadow travel skill, but there was something else that came into his mind, before he would do that.

’Wait a moment. I ran into Pure on the way here and we were in Area B? So that means that surely if there was only one way out from Area C that we should have run into the beast. Then doesn’t that mean there has got to be some way out?’ Quinn thought.

At that moment, something strange happened. An object fell from above and soon it just crashed and landed right in front of him. It started to slither on the ground and jumped straight towards Quinn.

Grabbing it, Quinn squeezed its head killing it instantly.

’Did that just drop from above?’ Quinn looked up and it was hard to see as the number of blue crystals started to lessen. In this case his eyes weren’t helping at all, as they had a hard time adjusting to light from the crystals.

If it was completely dark he could actually see better. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

’This beast must have come from one of the sinkholes... did the Demi-god tier beast do the same thing? Not all of the surface is a giant sinkhole, so it could be travelling on land, then connecting that way, maybe Pure did the same thing?’

Thinking of this, Quinn thought that it might actually be better to find out how the beast had left this place, and follow it from there. Seeing what state the beasts were in he could see that all of the crystal had been taken from their bodies.

This was a humanoid beast with intelligence, it would know that it got weak after consuming the crystals, so perhaps it had made or found a different area to fall back to as he absorbed.

In the end, Quinn decided the best course of action was to climb up and see for himself. He went up to the wall and started to use his strong fingers to pierce into the wall, then quickly scaled it trying to see if there were any signs of anything. To his surprise he was more right than he thought.

Climbing up past the blue crystals, Quinn was able to see clearer as his eyes adjusted. There he could see that there were several tunnels, and even deeper inside he could see that some of them had beasts inside.

’Maybe that beast didn’t climb to the top, after all. If the military only cared about mining crystals, maybe they never found these extra tunnels up here. Which means the beast can move from whatever area it wants when it wants. So then why doesn’t the beast just run away? Why doesn’t it go to a new area that they hunt and try to take over yet?’

It was then that Quinn remembered the message that was played from the lab. Perhaps the Demi-god tier beast felt like this was more personal.

Using his Inspect skill Quinn just looked at all of the tunnels to see if he could spot something interesting, then something certainly interesting did come up. Pulling himself up he entered and soon started running. He was now running down the tunnel until eventually he had reached a medium sized opening.

Here he could see that a type of platform from a type of dirt had been formed, tuning it into a giant bowl. Regardless, Quinn was interested about what was in the bowl as there were just crystal upon crystals inside.

’Why would all these crystals be here? Wait. Is the Demi-god tier beast just holding these crystals? Maybe it’s planning to use them later, or all at once. That also means that the Demi-god tier beast won’t be in a weakened state. Not like the military thought they would be.’

There was another tunnel on the other side of the room, and thinking that this was the beast’s him he could only guess that the beast went in that direction. Before leaving though, Quinn wondered something. It was about the Qi energy that was missing from his body and that he still hadn’t recovered from.

With the silver gauntlet, he grabbed hold of one of the crystals.

[Skill activated]

The palm of his gauntlet that was holding the crystal started to glow, and so did the crystal. At the same time he could feel the energy moving inside of his body. Growing stronger and replenishing all the energy that he had lost.

’It worked! I can use the skill on crystal and still replenish my Qi. Although the crystal loses all of its energy that way. I can’t just leave all these crystals here.’ Quinn thought, looking at them all.

’I wonder what happens if I keep absorbing energy from them...’
