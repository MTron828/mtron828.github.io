Chapter 2453 Fight the Divine Brigade (Part 1)

The four large figures stood there on their own in the centre of the arena, and the one they were after had completely disappeared. The feeling from these figures, they didn't feel human, almost as if they weren't alive which was giving a shiver all over Layla.

"Everyone, what are you doing!" Layla shouted, as she turned her head. "Get everyone out of here!"

The scream was loud and this time, unlike before, it was amplified by Qi. Seeing this, Muka got to work informing the vampires to evacuate the people as quickly as possible. Xander was on the move as well, as they ordered everyone to get to the main settlement as quickly as possible.

One of the dark Divine warriors was the first to move. It looked at the crowd with its dark blue eyes, and lifted its spear. At the very tip, energy started to gather. A ball of energy was growing larger and larger and it was pointed right at the crowd.

The energy was expanding and it was building up ready to fire. From right above the spear, a small red coloured figure had appeared, and with its two hands slammed the spear. The energy had burst shortly after and was shot right into the ground.

The blast had cracked the hard, specially made, metal flooring for the fighting event. Large chunks were thrown up in the air and cracks were created in the ground that went further and further until it had even reached the bottom of the stadium where the crowds were sitting.

"Holy crap, we better get out of here!" The vampires shouted.

Maybe it was their arrogance, but the vampires until now were slowly exiting from the arena. They were strong and powerful, so even large creatures didn't seem too frightening to them now, but it was clear.

If the attack hadn't been stopped, or redirected, then a large chunk of the crowd would have just disappeared into nothing.

"Come on Tobi, we have to leave!" Abby said, dragging him by the arm.

"But what about Minny, she's still out there!" Tobi shouted.

"And what can you do to help her?" Abby asked. "Minny is stronger than any of us. Strong enough to even match up with the leaders. She just saved us by stopping that thing. So let's get out of here, so she can fight that thing at full strength and kick its arse!"

Tobi wanted to stay and help, but he knew what Abby said was true. The resolve in him was growing, one day he wanted to be strong enough, to be the one that could protect Minny.

"Like that could ever happen!" Abby commented, as they exited the seats and were now heading through the tunnels to the outside.

"How can you tell what I'm thinking?"

Back on the floor, on the other side, Andy and Jessica had jumped over and were running towards the main fighting area, but they weren't alone as two other vampires were following them, the vampires from the Graylash community.

"You guys get out of here!" Andy shouted.

"Hey, we're not as weak as you may think!" Valnar shouted. "Besides, that b*stard, he came from outside. The least we can do is help."

Facing their way, were the light Divine beings. They had no weapons in their hands but instead just had their palms out. Energy started to gather in their palms, golden in colour, and shot out at the group.

It hit the ground as the vampires dodged the blasts, but they didn't stop there. The golden Divine beings were moving their hands at incredibly fast speeds shooting out energy all over the place.

The vampires were quick to avoid them all, but they could see the large circle scorch marks that were left on the floor, if they were hit, then it could very well mean the end for them.

As they ran, the two vampires, including Jessica, all let out a large blast of their energy. Two red lines of blood aura came out, and for Jessica, she wasn't holding back either as her yellow energy was let out.

When the attacks were inches from touching them, the Divine beings suddenly disappeared, and reappeared shooting out another shot of energy. It was unexpected and landed right on Jessica.

She slid back, her feet sliding across the floor, and the outside of her skin was burnt and it was falling to the ground.

"That freaking hurt!" Jessica screamed.

Close enough to the enemy, Andy decided to go strike it with his own fist. He swung it out, increasing it in size, but just like before, the golden being was able to teleport, avoiding the attack completely, and it threw two quick blasts of energy as it moved its hand, both of them had hit him cleanly right on his body.

His skin was burnt, and a large chunk of it fell from his face, but part of his body was already starting to heal.

"This is going to be really annoying, isn't it?" Andy thought.

Back on the other side, where the dark Divine beings were, the second one had two balls of energy having formed at either end of their spear. Once again, it wasn't looking at anyone below it, instead it was looking at the crowd, those that were still trying to run away,

It swung its spear, spinning it, and from the top and bottom, small parts of the energy started to swing off from the weapon. They were going all over the place, right to the crowd.

Jumping up, Layla sliced through one of the energy blasts managing to break it, but she could only stop one at a time. The other attacks continued forward and landed right in the stands.

A large explosion went off, and the screams of vampires were heard. Some had instantly been killed in the attack, while others had part of their limbs torn off.

Placing her sword away, she knew she had to try something else instead. She brought out her bow, and started to fire multiple Qi arrows, right at the source of energy that was coming from the spear.

As the Qi arrows hit the sources of energy, they exploded, stopping the attacks. With the bow she was able to shoot multiple arrows and at a fast enough speed to stop the attacks.

'This is bad though, I'm having to use a lot of Qi to stop those attacks. They aren't weak by any means. Eventually I'll run out, and then what? Do I have to stop worrying about the others behind me‚Ä¶ and just try to kill this thing?'

She had to make a decision, and it had to be a big one. In the end, she shot out five Qi arrows, four of them going towards the multiple attacks, while one went toward the head of her enemy.

'I'm sorry, if I don't do this, then everyone will die!'

The attacks had been stopped and the Qi arrow had hit the dark warrior right on the top of its head. The power of the strike caused it to topple as it fell to the floor.

Quickly, Layla glanced behind her, but there was no attack. It hadn't hit the arena, instead she could see Galen, with the shadow covering his body.

"You kill, I will protect!" Galen said. "Dad said, I can use the shadow‚Ä¶ in emergency, I think this is an emergency." Vissit nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for ùíèew ùíèovels

"Well, you're right about that."
