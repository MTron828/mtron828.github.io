Chapter 2514 ¬†Mundus Confidence

A simple effortless push from Mundus' hand had caused Peter to fall back onto the ground. It showed the group one of two things. Either they had truly exerted that much energy in their fight against Luce, or Mundus was just that much stronger than them.

However, either of those things led to the same result, so it didn't matter much anyway. F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

"You asked about Quinn earlier," Hikel said. "Which means you must know he's here, and someone as strong as you has to be able to feel what's going on right now. You should know exactly where he is. So why are you stopping us from getting to him?"

The red mist, the blood that was flowing through the air. Every single life form would have been able to feel the large amount of power that was gathering on the planet.

"Firstly, you should be thanking me," Mundus explained. "I've saved your life not once but twice now by stopping you guys from doing something stupid in thinking that you can help Quinn.

"Look at your state; if you went there, you would only serve as a distraction for him and a tool Immortui could use to get to him. I don't know how many times you people have dealt with him, but he is one who is happy to use anyone to get his way."

Hikel stopped to look at himself for a moment and noticed that Mundus was right. Hikel didn't even have his arms anymore. The only thing he could do was attempt to run in and cause a large explosion, and they had seen how well that had worked out against Luce; it was likely to produce even less of a result this time.

will not let you get in my way of what I have come here to do," Mundus claimed.

"On top of that, let me make this clear: I am not on your side. I decided to help you because I saw an opportunity to get rid of a rather large headache. As a thank you, I decided to help you, but I will not let you get in my way of what I have come here to do," Mundus claimed.

"And what is it, because if it's to get rid of Quinn, then me and you are going to have to go at it!" Peter shouted from the ground, his legs still a too little weak for him to stand up.

"I have come here for one reason only, and that is to stop Immortui from escaping the red space and heading out to the golden space," Mundus explained. "I made a deal with Quinn that the celestials wouldn't get involved in the matter of Earth.

"Unfortunately, it looks like one of the Ancient Ones has taken it into his own hands, but as long as the matter is resolved, everything should turn out okay. Only the main issue is Quinn himself. He has the power to break through and create a link into the golden space.

"Depending on the amount of time life forms spend in a certain space, there is a part of them that still lingers there and is connected. With the massive amount of power Quinn has, and the link he has, Immortui can use him to open a portal to the other side."

This was the rejection that Quinn had experienced when he came into the red space that shot him all over the place. The others had a strange feeling in their bodies ever since coming here, but thought it might have been due to the red mist that was around them.

"Then shouldn't you help him?" Hikel asked. "If you helped Quinn to defeat Immortui, then that would solve the problem, right?"

A small smile appeared on Mundus' face hearing this. If Quinn did manage to defeat Immortui, it would mean he would have power as great as the Ancient Ones. Truthfully, even Mundus was here secretly away from the other Ancient Ones.

He wanted to keep his word, keep his position with the Ancient Ones, and also stop them from learning about the God Slayer armour, but maybe this was all too much for Mundus to ask for.

"The easiest thing to do, and the best thing to do, are sometimes two completely different answers. If I just wanted to stop Immortui, then I would have attempted to get rid of Quinn. With him gone, there would be less of a chance of him coming over."

Although Mundus said this, he thought it was next to impossible. Quinn had defeated the most troublesome god slayers there were out there. With their armour, he was even stronger. Mundus couldn't defeat Quinn if he wanted to, he knew that, and it was the same as Immortui.

"So then what are you going to do!" Peter slammed the ground. It was painful for him, knowing that with each passing moment Quinn was fighting against Immortui on his own again. He had already lost once, and they still needed the blood of two more demon kings.

"What do you think, isn't it the most obvious answer? I need to just wait to see the outcome of this fight," Mundus replied. "If Quinn is able to best Immortui, then all will be well, but if there is a chance and it looks like he's going to lose, then I will finish him myself. In order to protect the golden space. Quinn would understand."

the Ancient Ones in order to keep his promise, it looked like after the events of today, it was impossible, and out of Quinn or In a way, it felt like Mundus was supporting Quinn; he was doing it in a way where he would remain neutral and was hoping that he could finish this.

Although he wanted to hide the result and hide Quinn's power from the Ancient Ones in order to keep his promise, it looked like after the events of today, it was impossible, and out of Quinn or Immortui being kept alive, at least Mundus knew who he preferred.

"Alright, we won't go help Quinn, but there is something we need to do then," Hikel said.

From one side of the planet, large waves of aura were bursting through their bodies. They could feel an intense reaction that was telling them to get away as far as possible. Equally, on another side, large shockwaves of wind were blowing out with several large bangs and explosions.

It was clear that another giant-scale battle was happening, and Hikel feared that it was Edvard, Chris, and the Champions.

"I already protected you from death once; my debt has already been paid," Mundus claimed. "If you wish to go ahead and go elsewhere away from Quinn, then that is down to you."

As quickly as he came, Mundus had left, leaving them the choice of what to do. However, Mundus was heading to another particular location, not where Quinn was, nor where Chris and Unzoku were fighting. Instead, he had entered a cave, where a faint breath could be heard.

A blonde-haired man was holding his stomach with his back up against the wall.

"You‚Ä¶ you're dying," Mundus said.
