Chapter Ôªø1864: Take down the ship (Part 2)

Almost everyone who had come with Muka felt their heart beating slightly faster than before. They wondered if they were really going to go through with it, and when Peter, Muka and Chris began to prepare and discuss the plan, it seemed like it was the case.

Previously they had taken a very cautious and defensive approach, however, now, the representatives of the Green family would be the aggressors.

"Don't worry. If all works out well, then it will mean that Pure will have no forces to stand on." Chris explained. "On top of that, I will become the big bad wolf. There will be no one to blame the Green family. I just need you guys to keep the heart and make sure Zero never gets his hands on it again."

Chris walked up to the elevator door and was ready to push the button. The first place they would head to was the lab.

"What are you going to do?" Peter asked. "After this, attack. As you said, the people will hate you. They will think you betrayed them. It also means if Logan wants to win the people's trust, they can't take you in either."

Chris let out a big sigh and pressed the button.

"I've lived for too long anyway. Maybe I'll just rest after this."

All of them entered the elevator as they had done before, and with Chris's hand print, he had access to take them straight to the lab. It was the only place where the others hadn't gone during their tour.

The elevator moved fast, heading downward and quite deep towards the front of the ship. After a while, everyone heard a 'ding', and they stepped out of the lift, not wielding their weapons at first. The room they were in now was a giant lab full of several different pieces of equipment.

What was also surprising to them were the giant containers that were in place.

"This‚Ä¶reminds me of the vampire settlement," Muka commented.

This was because, in those giant glass containers that Pure had, there were the half-breed humanized beasts that Pure had been making. They never did stop with their trials. Some looked more beast than human, while a few looked complete human but had hollowed eyes.

"All of them have been drugged," Chris explained. "They probably don't even know where they are. This isn't something I wanted to show you, but it's the only way to get to the main lab."

As they walked through, Muka noted that the giant containers looked to hold about 100 people each, and there were 24 containers in total. Pure was experimenting on a lot of people, and she imagined each container was a different experiment.

"Sir 1!" A person in a lab coat greeted Chris. He looked to be writing notes while inspecting one of the giant containers. "What are you doing here?" The man started to walk towards the group and soon realized who Chris was with.

"Agent 1‚Ä¶why have you brought the guest down to the facility? Agent 4 stated under no circumstances were they to- "

The lab coat scientist's eyes suddenly started to turn white. It was as if they had rolled into the back of his head as he collapsed onto the floor and blood trickled out of his nose.

"Is he‚Ä¶dead," Lucia asked.

She didn't understand what had happened. The man was saying to them, and they didn't attack or take any action, but the next second he was suddenly on the floor, bleeding.

'"We can't allow them to raise an alarm. So if you want your people to live safely, we will have to take some drastic steps." Chris explained. "And trust me, these people in this lap aren't worth good people either."

Being the Top Agent and the second-in-command, Chris had access to everywhere, at least almost everywhere. He continued to walk ahead and kept pressing his hand and opening door after door as the group went through different parts of the lab.

Chris explained that the real action would begin once they got their hands on the Red Heart.

They would destroy the rest of the lab, and considering the numbers in the group, Chris knew it wouldn't take much time.

However, there was one door that Chris couldn't open. No matter how many times he placed his hand on the scanner, it wouldn't accept his handprint.

"Damn it. Looks like Agent Four never trusted anyone with his research. The Red Heart has to be in here." Chris frowned, "There's a change of plan. Everyone, let's split and head to the different parts of the lab.

"The second I destroy this door to get in, it will set off the alarm for the entire ship. So if there is one thing we need to do, it is to get rid of this lab."

Listening to Chris, everyone had split up. The lab was larger and split by several doors, but it should be possible with numbers and their strength. However, there was one person who had decided to stay with Chris, and that was Muka.

"EVERYONE READY!" Muka shouted. "1..2..3!"

Chris gathered his Qi and blasted a punch right at the door. It was blown outward, instantly destroying the reinforced door with ease. At the same time, lighting bolts, vampire aura, blood shots and more were all used to destroy the servers, the terminals, and all the equipment that was being used in the room.

Just like Chris said, alarms went off in the lab and throughout the entire ship, alerting all Agents and the army that the lab was under attack.

Agent 4's personal space was small compared to the rest of the rooms, but it had the top technology, one anyone would need to do their own research. Unfortunately however, it looked nothing like the last time Chris was inside.

"It's all gone," Chris was shocked. "Everything that was in here before, all of it is gone. None of the Vampire armour and the Red heart is here!"

A dreaded thought ran through Chris's mind at that point and time. What were they planning to do if Agent four took everything with him and went along with Zero? Why would they need the Red Heart?

Did this mean they had gathered enough energy for whatever they had planned?

'Did Zero even tell me the truth? Are they really on that planet in search of Demon-tier beasts? He wanted me to stay‚Ä¶so I couldn't stop him.'

The Pure army was rushing to the lab, heading from all over places, and the drills that the Pure had practised many times were coming into action. Most of the civilians stayed indoors or went to the pre-built shelters on the ship, which were reinforced areas designed for the people's safety.

On the outside of the ship, in the open fresh air, Agent 17 coordinated the Pure Army to also be on the lookout for any attacks coming from the outside. While standing on the deck and out to the edge though, they suddenly noticed something strange going on in the sky.

'Is that‚Ä¶thunder? But isn't it sunny today?' Everyone stared at the sky in confusion.

In the next second, a massive beam of white light shot out from the sky. It was tremendous and wide, far more expansive than the giant ship itself and blasted into the Ocean, causing huge waves around hundred meters to rise.

They came out fiercely as if the Ocean was angry and had hit the ship and pushed it onto its side. Everyone on board was being pushed, dangled and chucked all over the place. The small fleet of vessels that would protect the larger ship was destroyed by the precious waves.

Even Peter and the others had been knocked off their feet, sliding down, unsure what was happening. Chris jumped using the strength in his feet and slashed through all the metal of the ship. He easily made it to the top, only to see the large beam of white light hitting the Ocean.

"What is going on?" Chris wondered.
