Chapter 957 - Disappointment

It didn‚Äôt take long for word to get out about what the Cursed faction had done to the other head generals. Especially since it was done to those in the military. One of them had a crushed hand that needed to be healed, while the others were supposedly kneeling behind and looked like they were on the verge of holding back their tears, or so the rumours said.

Because of the news spreading around so quickly, the three head generals that had been involved were called into a meeting with Oscar himself. Currently, all three of them were standing in front of him having given their reports of the event that had occurred.

"Those people from the Cursed have no respect. We never raised a finger against them. Yet they go around abusing their power like that and at a gathering of all things!" Innu, the red-haired general, complained.

Oscar let out a big sigh. He didn‚Äôt think there would be problems. It wasn‚Äôt even the first day of the school semester. However, sometimes this is what happens when a bunch of hot-headed fools were placed in the same room together.

Oscar knew that based on the military. Due to them giving positions out based on strength and ability often things like this would happen. What they didn‚Äôt know was the person they were messing with, Quinn, was far stronger than both of them.

"I have heard your complaints, both of yours. My advice to you both would be to ignore this event for the sake of humanity‚Äôs future. The Cursed faction, the Graylash family, and the Earthborn coming together and cooperating is essential to our survival. Do you understand?"

Both of the men looked at each other, gripping their hands tightly. They were hoping Oscar might act out against them, do something like he would have done in the past. However, it almost sounded like they were the ones getting a slap on the wrist while the Cursed faction received nothing for their humiliation. They reluctantly agreed and nodded towards Oscar.

"We understand.‚Äô they both said, leaving the room.

"Samantha, would you mind staying behind," Oscar ordered, and the other two left the room.

"I hope I can trust you to tell me the real tale of events. It seems you didn‚Äôt quite agree with the story they told. I mean they didn‚Äôt really let you speak." Oscar said.

Samantha, the third head general that was there at the time explained everything that had happened. She told them how the two were disrespectful to the Cursed faction. However, what she didn‚Äôt manage to catch was that one of her own, was about to use an ability on Helen.

In her eyes, the ones that had attacked first were the Cursed faction, with Peter having crushed one of their own fingers.

"Thank you, I thought it would be something along those lines." Oscar replied. "You are free to leave."

However, before leaving Samantha wanted to ask her own questions.

"Supreme commander, if I may speak." She asked, and Oscar was listening keenly. "The man known as Hardy. He was somehow able to force those two to do his bidding.. It looked like they couldn‚Äôt move and everything he said it was as if their bodies were being forced to listen to that order. I was afraid at the time if he had told them to kill themselves they would have compiled.

"It was the first time I had ever seen two head generals being so powerless in front of another. Who is the person the Cursed family has sent to us?" Samantha asked. What she was also thinking, was if the Cursed family had someone this powerful under their control, what of their leader.

Of course, Oscar had been told to keep Quinn‚Äôs identity a secret and he actually thought this was a good idea himself. Ever since Truedream‚Äôs disappearance, although the military had gotten their act together there were more cases of infighting than ever. As those with strong abilities refused to listen to those above.

Still, he was thinking about the multiple things he saw Quinn do, not just the shadow or the red aura ability he seemed to have but Quinn‚Äôs background and identity was so secretive. Information could only be found out about him and his parents and never went further back then that.

Turning around, Oscar went to look at the whole school once more as he gave his answer.

"I don‚Äôt really know who that person is, and I don‚Äôt know much about the Cursed faction." Said Oscar. "However, I can tell you what I think. I think we should do everything we can to make sure that person is on our side."

The next day was the opening ceremony for the new school. All the first year and second year students based on their age had already had their introduction and had received their uniforms.

However, there was a big difference this time compared to the last, although each of them wore watches on their wrist, there was no power level being displayed for everyone to see.

At the moment, a large temporary stage had been built, one the size of a large concert. On top of that there were multiple screens all facing towards one direction that would allow everyone to see what was happening no matter how far they were.

The students stood in the centre of the school, where the large open field was surrounded by all the different buildings coming from different directions. To just get from one end of the green to the other it looked like it would take half an hour.

The students, and been split up into nine groups. They were unaware of why this was the case or what was happening today, only that an opening ceremony was to be held and to start it off, was none other than Oscar.

As he took to the stage the crowd of students cheered loudly. It seemed like his reception was mostly positive. Despite the fact that these students had come from all sorts of different factions. They still knew him as a war hero from the last war.

Oscar started to give them a grand speech about what war was like and why it was important for the students to attend. He also gave them a breakdown of what they would learn and finally he had mentioned about the housing system.

How the nine groups they were in now, would be split into three different houses. The Cursed house, Graylash house, and the Earthborn house. Being in a house didn‚Äôt mean you would have to join that group once you left the military. It meant two things, points would be assigned to houses based on good behaviour scores and sporting events.

The second, was which head generals would lead certain houses, as the generals would correlate with the house they were in. For example if they were in the Cursed house, those students would either be under Quinn, Peter or Helen.

The groups of students were eventually told what house they belonged to, with house 2, 4 and 6 belonging to the Cursed house. Hearing this news, there were some students that were annoyed while others were indifferent as they realised it didn‚Äôt matter too much.

Groups 1,3 and 5 belonged to the Earthborn house, while the last remaining groups 7, 8 and 9 belonged to the Graylash family.

"Now that all introductions are complete, it‚Äôs time to meet your Head generals in person. Any problems, concerns you want to raise you need to talk to these people. They will help you carve your future." Oscar said, as he left the stage.

Soon, an announcer was being heard coming from the stage, and lights started to flicker in all sorts of directions as if a real concert was about to begin.

"First introducing your head general of the first family from the Earthborn group. Samantha Reeves!" The announcement said.

Coming out to the stage Samantha waved at the crowd below. She stomped with her feet along the way, and pieces of earth were lifted to the ground. Moving her hands she joined the pieces of earth to create a large dragon like sculpture. It seemed so real and so alive. Soon after she started to swirl it around her body and when her little show was done, she dropped it to the floor.

"Did you see how skilful she was using her earth ability?"

"Yeah, she could carve and control the earth like it was a real dragon, it didn‚Äôt even look to have any cracks in it or anything. How much control does she have?" The students were amazed.

This continued with each general of those in charge of the Earthborn group coming out, and each time they would display their powers in an amazing way. Upstodatee from n(0)/vùíÜ/lbIn/.(co/m

Next, were the Graylash family, and they seemed to have done the same as well.

"Do we have to do something flashy?" Quinn asked, showboating wasn‚Äôt really in his nature.

"I thought with you being closer to their age you would understand more." Helen replied. "They need to be inspired and amazed. What better way to make them listen, by showing what hard work and dedication can lead to. It‚Äôs also a way to show our groups power. Just think, what would you have wanted to see when you were at school." She said, and soon her name had been called up as well.

Helen, seemingly walking on to stage as confident as ever, then raised her hands and at the same time, several plants had risen from the ground in place. The camera then revealed from above, that the plants had made a special love heart, while all the plants were different colours. To finish it off, she brought all the plants together, raising up a gigantic one behind her that looked like a serpent with a giant pink rose head.

"Ahhh!" Girls started screaming. "It‚Äôs Helen from Daisy, isn‚Äôt she amazing!"

The next name that was to be called to the stage was Peter, and as he walked over with his hands in his pocket. He stared at them all for a while, and the crowd had gone silent.

Finally, he started to do something, as he raised a single arm in the air.

‚ÄôMaybe I can get an idea of Peter?‚Äô Quinn thought, but that idea was quickly chucked out of the window.
