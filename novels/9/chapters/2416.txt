Chris, Hikel, and Russ had successfully escaped from their deadly situation. While Russ had next to no marks on his body at all, currently both Chris and Hikel were receiving healing from Sil. The group were still in the desert, in the middle of nowhere. There was next to no signs of life and the sun was just starting to rise.

The two didn't just have surface wounds but also internal wounds as well, that needed quite a bit of focus even for Sil's healing skills. 

"You know, I could have done the same thing?" Russ said. He was annoyed at how much both Chris and Hikel had been thanking Sil, almost as if they had forgotten that Russ had just saved them back in the pit. 

"Since you guys have memories of Sil, I can practically use any of his powers, I could have teleported us out of that situation if we needed." 

"Wait, you could!" Chris said, shocked to hear the news, he nearly jumped up but Sil pushed him down, trying to force him to heal. There was a glowing light coming out of Sil's hand that was slowly going across his chest. 

"I thought because of the sword you couldn't use power like that." 

"Are you an idiot?" Russ smirked, and kissed the side of his mouth. "How do you think I use my own powers? As long as the sword is in the scabbard then it's fine."

"Then why didn't you get us out of there!" Chris asked. At the moment Chris was finding himself in a weird state, he was acting out of character, he realised it was due to the situation he was in. 

For a moment, he thought he was doomed, and the only way out was to feast on the others next to him. He thought those days were behind him. In order to get stronger in the past he had used the life stealing technique taught to him by Zero. 

At the time, he didn't quite know what it was doing, but now there was no excuse, he never wanted to feel that way again and for a second he had considered it, which was why he was extremely angry at himself. 

"You said we needed information." Russ replied. "The whole reason why we stayed there in the first place was because we were trying to find out things from the demon king. We met the demon king didn't we? Otherwise, what was the point of us staying there?"

With the tensions high, Hikel decided it was best for them to change the subject after all, there were now more important matters for them to think about. 

"Sil, we got the signal, you said you found Quinn, where is he, and where are the others?" Hikel asked. 

"Actually, they are still there. It might be more correct to say we know where he is." Sil replied. "I am just a clone."

"Just a clone, so how did you know how to get us?" Hikel asked. 

"I changed my abilities before creating another version of myself. I gave myself the teleportation powers to get you guys out of there if needed. Telepathy to communicate with you, and healing just in case you guys were seriously injured." 

The group was glad to have someone as reliable as Sil on the team. 

"I'll explain as much as I can and when we're done, we'll be on the move." Sil said.

Peter and Edvard had to trust Sil with this one, since he was the most likely to locate where Quinn exactly was. They were continually teleporting all over the place, trying their best to see if there were any signs of Quinn. 

Going to areas where there was noise or fighting that was occuring, and so far what they had witnessed was an extremely cruel world.

Since Sil was going to areas where there were signs of fighting, they were witnessing people of the same kind battling against each other. In other areas, demons were playing games with others. 

On one occasion, they even saw these strange water creatures bouncing around to head to each other in the river. All of them had experienced war, they had seen death, but not like this.  Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

There wasn't even a war going on, and nearly everywhere they went, there were smiles on their faces as they did this. It wasn't fighting out of desperation or killing for the sake of survival, it almost looked as if they were doing this for fun.

There were multiple situations where they saw this, that the group could have helped but they didn't. They needed to stick to the task, and getting involved in small scuffles here and there wouldn't change a thing.

"I'm getting really tired of going around all over the place and getting nowhere!" Peter shouted. 

Ignoring him, Sil teleported them all anyway, he didn't need the others touching him to teleport, it just used less MC cells that way. Since if they were touching then it would count as just one person teleporting. 

When heading to the next location, they had entered what looked like some type of village. The buildings were crudely made and small, white in colour somewhat like a mud hut only built with different materials and just like many of the places they had entered before, this one was under attack as well. 

There were small creatures that looked human, only they had the half face of a skull on top of their heads, and then there were larger creatures that had red crystals all over their body concentrated on their back. 

It was the Skullys and the Durum type demons. It was a village for one of the Skullys. The houses they had resided in were destroyed, and they weren't being killed but instead captured. 

The Durum demons fired out crystals from their hands, stabbing the Skullys in the leg. The crystals would go right through and pin them to the ground like nails. Once a Skully was hurt enough, then they would drag them and throw them into a red crystal cage that was on some type of floating platform. 

The floating platform and cages were following the Durums around as they chucked Skully after Skully into the cages. 

"Ahh, I need to get my frustration out, I can't take it any more!" Peter said, as he ran away form the group, he leapt up in the air, and a Skully had fallen over, it was on its back while a Durum hovered over him. 

With his fist, Peter threw it out, hitting the Durum demon right in the chest. The whole Durum demon's body went crashing into the ground, the body bounced, and a hole was made in the demon's chest and the crystals on its back shattered everywhere. 

The Skully couldn't believe that he had been saved by this stranger, and at the same time he had caught the attention of the rest of the demons. Getting up off the ground the Skully went over to Peter. 

"Thank you for -"

With a single hand, Peter grabbed the Skully by the neck and lifted it in the air. 

"Where is Quinn!" Peter asked. 

"I think… Peter's gone mad." Edvard said, wondering what to do now.
