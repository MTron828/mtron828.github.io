Chapter 939 - Answer them

Looking at the message that had appeared in front of him, Quinn was trying to figure out what the quest exactly was. The requirements for completing the quest weren’t clear and had been blanked out with question marks. Meaning Quinn didn’t really know how to complete it, but by the wording of the quest given, it was clearly alluding to something.

’Is it saying there is another evolution?’ Quinn wondered. ’Is there an evolution past that of a vampire lord?’

This was the only thing he could think of as to what the system was getting at, but if there was another evolution then when would it be unlocked? He had already reached level fifty and he wasn’t even sure if there was a level cap like there would be in games. 60, 80 maybe not until he reached level a hundred he would complete the quest.

’To my knowledge no. All the leaders, or at least all the current leaders during my time and yours are at the lord level. Although the Original vampires might be a bit different, they were born the way they were and don’t go through an evolution like yourself and the others.’ Vincent answered.

With no clue what the requirements were though, Quinn would have to put it in the back of his head for now.

’I wish the system could just stop playing games with me and be a little more upfront with me sometimes.’ Quinn sighed. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

’Well, that would defeat the mystery of the game after all. Remember the whole system was based on a game in the first place.’ Vincent answered.

Just seconds after, the door swung open and a group of people were excitedly rushing through the door to see him. It looked like when they saw the change in the castle and walls, they all knew there was only one person possible for such a thing.

"Quinn!" Some of them shouted, rushing over giving him hugs, cheers and slaps on the back.

"It’s good to see you all again as well." Quinn said.

There were many questions asked on both ends, as Quinn was unaware of what exactly had happened while he was in the cellar, and they too wanted to know what happened to him. This way everyone was getting more of a full picture of what was going on at the time and an idea of why things had played out the way they were.

"Well what a surprise." Sam said. "It looks like the one that clocked onto everything from the beginning was Peter."

Everyone turned to Peter who was in the room. He was leaning up against the wall at the very back with his arms crossed.

"I told you I had a bad feeling about her, maybe you guys should trust me a bit more." Peter said.

"Didn’t he think Xander was a bad person when he first met him as well?" Timmy whispered over to Amy.

"Well, maybe he’s not wrong." She teased, and the others who had overheard all started to laugh.

"I’m sorry to ruin this happy moment." Paul said breaking through and walking over to where Quinn was. "But there are some important matters we need to deal with. I’ve sent a report to the King that you are now awake as he requested, but before that, I really think we should deal with the matters outside."

"Outside?" Quinn said, confused at what Paul was going on about.

After some explaining, Paul told Quinn about those that now wished to join the tenth families and how many wanted to see who had saved the vampires.

"I didn’t know what you wanted to do, but there is one thing for sure, we are certainly lacking people. Therefore while you were asleep, I started to organise them into certain groups. I had people test them on a number of things and categorised them, based on their skills.’’ Paul started to explain.

"Wait, categorised based on their skills, do you mean like strength and fighting ability?" Quinn asked, and Paul didn’t say a word after. "Don’t Paul, don’t do it. You’re acting like you’re in the military again. I have to admit your way has had its uses and I have come to understand why the military did the things the way they did, but I do not want to do what they did.

"I want you to make a new list. Take a look at those that have been in the tenth family pooling area the longest. Bring them in first, then I want you to make a list of skills they are capable of or best at. I want you to find out what they are talented at and then find a use for their talent. Those that aren’t good at fighting won’t just be chucked aside.

"I want you to work closely with Timmy, he came up with a good reward system before, but I want these people to be rewarded for helping, and their loyalty to the tenth family. Is that okay?"

Paul paused for a second, and looked at the table of information in his hand. He then swiped the information off the screen and started a whole new one.

"You’re the leader Quinn, not me. I will do as you say, but I will make a suggestion. The momentum is in your favour now. You should go and answer those wishes, and let the people see who saved them. You deserve that much." Paul said.

The reason why Quinn wasn’t so quick to take up this idea was because Quinn had decided already that he wanted to leave this place. He felt a little strange helping them and doing all these duties when he wasn’t going to be here much longer.

’Do I take them back to the Cursed ship with me?’ Quinn wondered.

’I think just like you see Earth as your home, these vampires see this place as their home as well. There will be many that do not want to leave Quinn.’ Vincent explained. ’On top of that, would the vampires allow you to take that many with you? It would mean exposing their secret. Perhaps this is something you could discuss with Bryce but I don’t think the humans are ready to know of the vampire’s existence just yet.’

Honestly, Quinn couldn’t agree more. Although Quinn did think humans could live along with vampires it would be a learning curve and take time. On top of this, right now the humans were on their toes, waiting for the Dalki to attack at any moment.

Perhaps once the Dalki threat was over, Quinn could attempt to do what Arthur had failed at.

"Come on then, let’s go see everyone." Quinn said.

When leaving the castle, there were two more people waiting for him at the castle door. One of them Leo, his other Vampire Knight, and the other Peter.

"I understand why Leo is coming with us, because we should go out as the three of us, but why is Peter here?" Quinn asked.

"It seems that some of the people are also here to see Peter as well. He saved quite a bit of people while you were off fighting."

Walking through the inner castle area, Quinn could already hear the crowd of people talking. He had never heard the tenth area be so noisy before and with his super hearing he could hear and pick out certain sentences.

"I still can’t believe how the tenth has been able to grow so quickly."

"Everything changed when they announced their new leader. I didn’t think much of him at first."

"I always knew he was special, the tenth in the past always created great inventions that changed the vampire’s lives and look at what he is making for his people now."

"Then shouldn’t the tenth leader not be so selfish, he should share them with the other families?"

"After the other families attacked him, if he keeps everything for himself then so be it, I don’t blame him. It’s clear the new leader cares for all his people which is why he’s built so much to protect them."

At first, Quinn was happy to hear all the compliments, but soon it was making him feel sick as he got closer and closer.

’These people, they rely on a leader.’

"Look, that’s him, he’s finally here everyone!" One person shouted, and they soon all started to shout and cheer seeing Quinn. There were far more vampires than Quinn had expected and every single one was there for him.

The Royal Guard made sure no one was to get through the front gate, and the vampires made sure to listen, but they continued to move their heads to get a look at the leader. Some of them hadn’t even bothered to care to burn in the memory of the tenth leader when they had first seen him at the ceremony, so they didn’t even know what Quinn really looked like.

Seeing the commotion, Quinn jumped up using his strength to the top of the wall in one go, and soon Peter, Leo and Paul followed him. The four of them stood there looking down at all the vampires.

"Thank you for protecting us!"

"It’s the Wight, the Wight that saved you, look!" A mother said, pointing upward towards Peter.

’Do you still think you can just up and leave this place?’ Vincent said. ’You remember, you promised me and said you would look after them, Quinn. You now have a connection with them.’

Vincent was right, Quinn had already promised to protect those in the tenth, but now other vampires also wanted his help, not just those from the tenth anymore.

’What am I meant to do now?’
