Chapter 1166 Broken strings

Now that Fex had exited the Mech, things were starting to look up for the Earthborn group. The beasts that had threatened them all by surrounding them had quickly been tied up with his string. The vampire even had time to reinforce his string due to his new puppet.

’This Pure guy’s body is stronger than I had expected. He seems to be quite skilled and with my soul weapon giving him extra strength, he turned out to be quite useful.’ Fex thought. ’Will Layla mind if I keep him, even if we don’t manage to extract any information out of him?’

Despite Fex taking charge in this problem, the main problem remained that those inside the Mechs needed time to recover. Piloting a Mech and controlling it during a fight was similar to being in a boxing match, only that there were no guaranteed breaks in between. This was their first break, and even though they could catch their breath for a second, rejoining the fight they wouldn’t be able to fight with the same energy as before until they got a proper rest.

This just further proved how amazing Avion was as a Mech pilot. The Sergeant was fighting with just as much force as he had been doing when he started. The swings of his Mech were just as fast, just as smooth and he still hadn’t been hit despite going toe to toe with the Demi-god tier beast.

Under normal circumstances, the entire group would have to be used to subdue such a strong beast. Even when fighting against the Dalki, the feat that Avion performed could almost be called a miracle.

’What inhuman stamina does he have?’ Fex wondered. ’And how much stronger could he be if he would turn?’

As things were dying down in his fight against the beasts, the vampire was able to keep a closer eye on Avion, and that’s when he noticed the first slip up. So far during the fight, both the humanoid beast and Avion had managed to dodge each other’s attacks, the few that had been about to land on the beast would be blocked by the Demi-god tier beast transforming its hands into a type of shield.

Yet for the first time, after battling non stop, the beast didn’t attempt to block the attack coming towards it, as it swung down diagonally. The Mech’s sword hit its shoulder and the beast’s body almost transformed as it was going through it. And then using parts of its hard body, it clenched onto the sword.

Now using its other arn, it had transformed it into a blade that was as large as the Mech’s. Bigger than they had seen it used previously and swinging it sideways, it was able to hit one of the mechs weak points. The joint area of its right knee.

Small sparks flew and Avion was surrounded by sound inside the Mech as multiple alarms were going off.

[Warning, right leg is down to 80% efficiency!]

"Deploy thrusters in reverse!" Avion shouted at the machine, as he grabbed onto the sword with two hands. He needed that weapon if they had any hope of subduing, much less killing the humanoid beast. Finally pulling it out, a piece of dirt came with it and the smallest amount of black blood could be seen oozing from the beast’s shoulder.

Soon though, the body started to reshape and the blood flow stopped as well. From the looks of it, it had returned to peak condition.

’It can heal? This is going to be a problem.’

Flying back through the air, Avion thought he was safe from the beast, at least for a few seconds while he recovered and thought up his next actions, but the beast’s legs started to change again. The thigh muscles started to grow, and it was the same with the bulkiness of its calves. It’s legs were now nearly twice as large as before. Kicking off the ground with its legs the humanoid beast shot like a spring and had transformed both of its arms and its shoulder into something resembling a giant arrow head.

’If that thing hits me, then I will be dead for sure! Crap, I let my guard down since it had avoided going for me directly!’

Seeing the beast come at him, the pilot’s life almost flashed before his eyes. Instead, a large object had been thrown in front of him. The beast’s arrow pierced through the large object sending bits and pieces of scrap metal flying in all sorts of directions.

Although the beast’s attack had slowed down for a little it was still coming his way. For a short second Avion had seen hope, the only thing he wasn’t going to do was shy away from his death. He would keep his eyes open till the very last second, and in those moments he could see someone standing there in front of him.

The person had a strange black needle sticking out from their back, they were crouched down with their knees slightly bent.

’Who is that and why is he standing there? He needs to move or we’re just both going to die!’ Avion wanted to cry out as he appreciated the sentiment, but didn’t want to be responsible for such a useless sacrifice.

"Screw you guys for breaking my strings all the time, let’s see you break this!!" Strings started to rise around Fex and moved towards the palm of his hand. Using Blood control he was able to have finer control of all the strings and was able to create more out at a quick rate creating something. Then when the beast was close enough he threw out his hand, a net of red strings flying at it.

It surrounded the entire beast, but the strings hadn’t broken and were still attached to Fex’s hand. If one was to look closely as well, these strings didn’t look like Fex’ normal blood red strings. Rather than the normal shining light coloured red they would be. They looked more to be encased, twice the thickness with a dark red overcoat.

Eventually the beast’s pointed arrow head hit Fex’s hand, but controlling the strings now with his blood control, the vampire was able to wrap them completely around the beast, stopping its attack.

’It worked.’ Fex was gleeful, as the beast stayed in place mid air.

Combining the blood ornament with the red blood strings and blood control was tricky. Especially since Fex still wasn’t so great at using Blood control to use these two things at the same time. What allowed him to use such a skill was his special soul weapon that was actually more like a blood weapon.

After making sure the others were okay from the oncoming beasts, Fex tied up Agent 11 one more time, and took the black needle back out from him. In doing so, when inserting the black needle into himself. It gave him the boost and power he needed to fight on.

And there was an added bonus of not feeling bad about who the blood had exactly come from.

Now having seen what happened, Avion could tell that the person who had successfully stopped the attack, was the same one he had fought against in the arena. Not only that, but the weird object that had been hit first was Mech #3.

"Did you see that? That person lifted up the Mech and threw it all the way over there?" One of the soldiers asked the others to make sure his eyes hadn’t been playing tricks on him.

The soldiers were impressed but there was still one fact that they all had yet to face. They were simply celebrating due to them having been able to stop one attack from the beast. It still had yet to be hurt while all of them were exhausted, even Avion was now feeling the strain being put on his body.

At that moment, Fex’s strings also started to change colour as the Blood hardening started to fall off and break into particles.

’Did all the blood get used up from the needle already? That’s a lot faster than it usually takes. Is it because I had to use so much Blood control? Maybe I’m borrowing too much power from the needle rather than using my own.’ Still it was all guess work but it meant one thing, that the beast was definitely able to break free.

The beast no longer looked like an arrowhead, and was back in its human form. With its two bladed arms it slashed through Fex’s strings.

"Damn it, I knew this was going to happen." Fex muttered, and clenched his fist looking at the beast. "I am a Vampire Noble! I will not be afraid of some beast!"

A gust of wind swept past Fex’s face, moving his gelled hair slightly. It was strange feeling this in the tunnel, but he could tell it was the presence of a person. Then the next second, a loud bang was heard, and the beast could be seen flying through the air and crashing into the cave-like wall.

"Quinn?" Fex wondered, as he only knew one person this fast and could back a punch this strong, but his guess was wrong.

"Not quite, but someone who is just as strong." Shiro said from behind.
