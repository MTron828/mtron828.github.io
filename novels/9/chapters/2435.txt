"So far, while Immortui and Quinn conversed, Calva had done nothing but listen to the conversation.¬†

It had somewhat interested him why the ones they called Demons had taken over their world. He had heard pieces and bits while being tied up and now, hearing directly from Immortui himself, he understood more.

Immortui had been sent to this world and was trapped. He didn't come to conquer all the planets or enslave all of the races; he was simply building up an army to go against those that trapped him down here.

The more he learned, the more cruel he thought these people had to be, allowing all of their kind to suffer. Sure, they had their own problems, but they had amplified and gotten worse with the addition of the demons joining in. Yet, they were abandoned by these beings of great power just because they were too afraid of Immortui.

The conversation was quite an interesting one for Calva to follow, especially the words about reversing time. But it seemed like a matter that was far too complicated for him to worry about.

Instead, he had to make a choice. The reason he hadn't moved, attacking Immortui or Quinn, was because he didn't know how this conversation was going to play out. Would Immortui be able to convince Quinn and bring him to his side? After all, the two of them were demons, so they had to share some type of relationship.

If the two did decide to team up, then there was no fight left in Calva. It was pointless to go against both of them. At the same time, technically he hadn't done anything wrong. There was no rebelling, and he hadn't even killed one demon.

So, he would simply just give himself up. But there was a chance that Quinn would try to fight. The conviction in the words that Quinn had spoken‚Äîthey sounded real and strong, as if nothing was going to get in his way.

And he had seen a side of Quinn that the demons and the others would never show. He had compassion for another race. He had saved the Skullys in the midst of everything. It led Calva to believe that this was a good person, and maybe he should do what he could to support him.

Now that it looked like Immortui had figured out Quinn's plan, he was on the move.

"I have one last thing to say to you then!" Quinn shouted, as the shadow enclosed both of his hands, riding up to his elbow.

"I'm gonna f*cking kill you!" Quinn stated.

Appearing in both of Calva's hands were two large bone spears, the same that he had made when he went to attack Quinn.

"Quick, we have to stop him now with everything we have. Don't let him use his power!" Calva screamed.

There was a great urgency in his voice, panic in his actions as he threw the spears through the air. There was great power behind them, as if he had put everything he had on the line in throwing both of these spears.

They were filled with even more energy when they were thrown at the demon Quinn. With this much urgency, Quinn felt like something had to be up. This wasn't just a regular person but a champion who had fought against Immortui before.

It wasn't the time to fight Immortui at full strength. Quinn needed to do whatever he could to win. Looking around, thinking about what he could do, he stretched both of his hands outward.

'I may not have any blood aura left inside me, but I can still control the blood all around!'

The blood on the floor from the dead demons, the blood from the hardened blood like trees, Quinn could use that. Blood lifted from the air, the condensed blood around broke down, around where Immortui was at.

It swirled around in the air and went straight toward Immortui at full force. The two powerful attacks were breaking through the air. Unfazed, Immortui stood his ground and lifted both of his hands.Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

The spear was quickly grabbed by one hand of Immortui's, and it felt like all of the power was being lost until it dropped from the floor. Similarly, the same thing seemed to be happening with Quinn's attack.

The red aura was swirling around, and when it touched Immortui's hand, the color of the attack was fading. Even though only a small portion had touched Immortui's hand, it was spreading across all of the vampire aura and at a quick speed, getting rid of its color and its energy.

'What is this‚Ä¶ I have to do something fast!' Quinn thought.

With his blood control, he broke off the blood aura from the large-scale attack. The colorless power continued spreading through the rest of the aura, and when it had consumed it all, it turned into nothing. All of the attack's energy had been completely drained.

There was still plenty of blood on the battlefield that Quinn could use, and for now, he had gathered quite a bit of it around himself, condensing it down in the forms of balls behind his back.

"What is his power? What is happening?" Quinn asked.

It was clear that what he was using right now wasn't celestial energy, nor was it the energy that was naturally in the planet. This was Immortui's own power.

"I don't really know," Calva replied. "But this is only a part of his power; this isn't where the problem begins."

There was a reason for Calva saying this. Immortui raised his hand in the air, a ball of colorless power still in a ball shape around his hand.

"Unbroken world!" Immortui said.

The power spread out from his fist in all directions, and the color was starting to disappear from the space itself. Not just around his arms but in the air as well. Everything was losing its color, showing only whites, blacks, and grays.

It was as if everything had turned into a grayscale picture. It continued to spread out, even when it touched the blood as well as the hardened blood, the color disappeared from that as well, until it eventually reached the area both Quinn and Calva were in.

As soon as it hit them, almost all of the power in their bodies felt like it had gone completely. Quinn was unable to feel the blood aura, and he could almost feel the strength draining from him straight away.

He looked at Calva, who was covered in a sweat, looking as if he could barely move.

'I... have to do something!' Quinn thought.

The shadow that covered both his hands was the only thing that had color, but who knew for how long. Just like the energy that was draining from him, it felt like the power was being drained from his shadow as well, just at a slower pace.

With his hand reached out, Quinn could only do one thing.

Calva disappeared, and then looking at Immortui, Quinn used the skill one more time.

He himself had disappeared into the shadow as well.
