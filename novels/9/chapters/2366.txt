Chapter 2367 Have You Ever ?

Muka was a beauty that was indescribable, a lot of vampires already had a natural charm and beauty to them compared to regular humans, apart from their pale skin that in some cases would be liked or disliked depending on one's taste, but nonetheless, the facial features and symmetry for vampires was on point, with nearly no imperfections.

For Muka though, somehow she was able to be one above that. If one thought there was a golden ratio of how one's face was meant to look, she had a goddess ratio on her face.

Which was why, when there were suddenly two in the same room, they without a doubt recognised it as another Muka. This wasn't someone who had imitated her, or looked like her, no, this was a carbon copy from head to toe, at least in the looks department.

The way she stood, the way she walked and the way she talked‚Ä¶ they were all completely lost, as if someone had possessed her, but there were clearly two of them in the room.

'Wait what did she say?' Layla thought. 'Forger, Muka isn't a forger, and when they say best forger.'

Thinking about these words, she could only think of one forger, the one that Quinn put all of his trust into, and the one that had created all of the Cursed Faction's equipment for them.

"Wait, are you, Alex Way, the blood fairy forger!" Layla asked.

The others thought Layla was joking when she said this, this looked nothing like Alex, but then again, when they thought about it more, what had happened to Alex, where even was he?

"That can't be true, right?" Chris said.

"Unfortunately, it is true, maybe I can explain a little." Sil said, who seemed to be the only person not surprised by this, other than Russ who couldn't care less.

"You see, for a while now Alex has been trapped in one of the weapons he had created for Quinn, at least his consciousness has been trapped." Sil started to explain. "From what I know, Alex helped Quinn create his current armour set once more, and when doing so, his consciousness was transferred once again to the new set of weapons.

"After the war, I was asked by Quinn to move the conciseness from the weapon into a body, so Alex could continue living his life."

Due to Sil having all of the abilities, he was able to do this and had done it for Vorden, Raten, and Shiro as well.

"Wait." Peter said his mind lingering, it almost looked like one could see the cog wheels turning in his head. "I understand‚Ä¶ how Alex is here, but what I don't understand is why he is now as a woman."

"Yeah, or why he looks like Muka!" Chris said, his head still turning back and forth. In truth he also found Muka extremely attractive, and now he was trying to turn off one side of his brain, as he looked at Alex, he knew he was a guy, or at least used to be a guy but was now in a woman's body.

"I think I can do the explaining from here!" Alex said, as he walked forward and pushed out his leg, revealing how long and slender they were.

"You see, when they said my consciousness would be transferred I didn't want to live in the life of someone else's mind. Which was when the suggestion came up, that they could clone a body and I could use that.

"Just how Vincent is also in a clone of Quinn's body. Of course, a clone's body can only last so long, but once we find a nest crystal all will be good. Anyway, when I learned of this, I realised, I could be whoever I wanted to be.

"This is life changing, think about it, have none of you ever thought about what it would be like to be a girl for a day, and now it was possible. I lived hundreds of years as a guy, and now I can experience the best of both worlds. And, if I was going to be a girl, then why not be the damn best looking girl there is." Alex flicked his hair, proud of his new body.

In the middle of the conversation Muka couldn't stop shaking her head, she wanted to reject all of this, but Alex had done so much for the settlement, he was a hero behind the scenes, so if he wanted this, then she felt like she had to comply.

She was going to go back into a slumber after this anyway, so what would she care if someone used her appearance.¬†I think you should take a look at

"Alright, I think I understand most of what has happened." Edvard said, nodding his head up and down. "But what I don't understand is why is Alex here? If he is a forger, why is he going on this journey with us?"

Now, Russ was starting to get interested as he looked in Muka's direction.

"He is the one that you requested, or she‚Ä¶" Muka said.

"It's okay, I can't get used to it, so just call me she." Alex replied.

"Alright." Russ said walking forward. "There was a request I needed to be dealt with, and they told me that you're the one I want, that you might be the only person who knows what to do with this."

Pulling out from the opening of one of the special rings he had on his finger, a crystal now appeared in his hand, it wasn't an ordinary crystal, it didn't look like a beast crystal, nor like that of a nest crystal.

It was larger in size for one, and the inside had a strange substance moving in it.

"That's a god slayer crystal, where did you get that?" Alex asked. He had spent enough time recently around god slayer crystals to know what one felt like.VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

"Does that matter?" Russ asked. "What matters is whether or not you can make something out of this. If so, it will be useful to me, and useful to us on our journey."

Alex smiled as he grabbed the crystal from Russ's hands.

"I may be in a new body, but this body isn't weak, it's strong like that of the vampire leader. Of course I can make something out of this, and I will make sure it doesn't disappoint."

"Maybe you could make it disappoint a little." Layla commented. With the black sword and a possible god slayer item, Russ was going to become incredibly powerful.

"I will return here once I am done." Alex said, and he was off.

"Alright, while we wait for the crystal to be sorted, we need to discuss everything we know about the other side." Muka said. "And the plan for what to do once you are in there, because things are not as simple as they seem and this will be an incredibly difficult task."
