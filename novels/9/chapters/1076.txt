Chapter 1077 - I've found you

On their way back into the waiting area, Leo couldn’t stop being praised as soon as the other contestants saw him. All of them were staring at him in awe.

"How lucky must he have been to get such a cat?"

"I wonder what his beast’s level it’s at? Maybe we’ll get to see it fight even more beasts."

"I want to rub its belly." A man said with pink rosed cheeks, and there were a few more that agreed.

"Just to be clear, we are talking about the cat, right?"

It was unusual to see such small, powerful beasts, and especially with a person none of them knew. Those who had the beast taming ability would usually be part of the Bree family somehow, which was why they were so surprised to see someone else with strong ability.

Although no one questioned it for a few reasons, there were always those who might have learned the ability and left the faction, especially after Mona left. There was also the chance that it was taught to outsiders. Now with Mona gone, there wasn’t such a tight leash on the ability itself.

The other thing they thought, it was possible that this man was a nobody in the faction before and had just come across the cat. Taming a strong beast was a quick way to go up the ranks in the Bree family, so there would often be many who didn’t have one to start.

The way the Bree ability worked depended on their MC cells. They would form a type of link over the beast. In a way, rather than taming the beast, it was more similar to controlling its mind to the point where one would become its owner.

However, a person’s MC cells were limited. Some would have the strongest beast. Their ability allowed them to, while others would control multiple weaker beasts. Still, if they came across a beast that was stronger than their own and wished to tame it, the only thing they could do was get rid of the current ones they had.

’I’m glad that they are all finally seeing my worth.’ Ovin said, laughing inside Leo’s head. The black cat sure liked to showboat. Leo could tell there were other ways for the cat to have won that fight, but he just had to show off.

Although Leo didn’t think of it as a bad thing, initially, he wanted to stay hidden so he could look for those in Pure without them knowing about him. Still, since that wasn’t working, perhaps the best approach was to make them come to him.

Since Leo’s fight was the first match, everyone saw what had happened, and the rest of the matches continued. At the same time, contestants and their beasts received healing. Of course, Leo didn’t need any healing, and neither did Ovin. Still, Leo was also worried that they might just find out Ovin wasn’t a beast if he was seen to.

Eventually, everyone who had survived the first round stage had returned, and coming in last into the room, was a Traveller with shining bright blue beast armour that looked like a knight in the olden times. As they took off their helmet, their long blonde hair could be seen.

Soon the man went over to another. This one looked more like a gladiator appropriate for the setting they were in. He had spikes sticking from his shoulder pads, and his c.h.e.s.t was b.a.r.e, while he wore a strange helmet that pointed outward like a beak covering his face.

"It looks like that one might be our biggest threat, Pine." The blonde man whispered, looking at Leo, who was leaning against a wall in the room.

"Yes, I thought I might have been me and you, battling out till our claws went bloody inside. I didn’t think someone would interrupt us to get their hands on that Demi god crystal!" Pine replied.

The blonde-haired man’s name was Yell, and before Leo had entered, he was one of the favourites to win this event, and this was true for Pine as well, but at times when a strong unknown foe they didn’t know about appeared. Two enemies would become friends.

"I have a plan, he has strong beasts, but the Traveller himself might not be strong. I would say try to ignore the cat and go straight for the man." Yell said with a smile.

With Leo’s hearing, he knew everything that was going on, but he didn’t mind. They could plan all they want. No matter what they had prepared, he would win all of the matches and claim the prize. Not that he wanted it anyway.

’Perhaps I could get some good equipment out of this event. To become the sponsor and give something like that so easily. They must have great power. Perhaps he is involved in all of this as well?’ Leo thought, thinking about the large man.

The matches went on, and once again, Leo dominated his battles with his cat, hitting the opponent’s beast with one hit every time. They had fought everything up to an emperor tier beast. The same was for Yell and Pine, but something unfortunate had happened, and Pine was eliminated by someone else.

’That useless man, I wanted to see what he would do against the blind man first.’ Yell thought.

Now they were into the semi-finals of the tournament, and Leo was to go against Yell this time. The cat stayed on top of Leo’s head as they came out, and surprisingly decided to talk.

’I’m afraid that I might not be able to help you with this one.’ Ovin said.

Leo looked at the beast and could sense it was at the Emporer tier level. It was a bird type beast that was large and had its two legs grounded on the floor. Its wings were razor-sharp, which were used to slice the opponents it faced.

It was strange to hear Ovin say this, for Leo was sure he should have been able to defeat something like this.

’I’m not weak. I’m just weak at the moment. When connected with our hosts, we familiars aren’t meant to stay out this long, but because you had me pretending to be a beast, I stayed out for you. Finish this as quick as possible, and then let me rest.’ Ovin said, jumping off his head and pretending to fight once again.

Leo didn’t really understand the familiars that well. If they suffered so much connecting to a host, then why did they choose to have one in the first place. Was it the d.e.s.i.r.e that Ovin had talked about?

Still, the fight was to continue, and Leo wanted to return the favour to Ovin.

"I will finish this as quickly as possible," Leo stated.

"Sir, we tried looking into that man that you spoke of. There was no information about him concerning the Bree family." The man reported. "However, when we continued digging, we did find someone that thought they might have recognised him. They believe that he is under the Cursed faction at the moment, the man who is known as one of the Heroes of the war, the blind swordsman."

As Chris heard this information, his heart beated faster than ever. He looked down at the arena floor, and Leo had drawn his sword. The beast was coming straight at him, ignoring the cat, and Ovin had even jumped out of the way.

"Yes, I will win this thing!" Yell shouted.

Lacing his weapon with as much Qi as possible, Leo struck once, cutting off the whole of the beast’s wing cleanly as it went past. It immediately fell crashing onto the floor, and before Yell could do anything else, the blade was pointed at his neck.

"I surrender!" Yell shouted.

The crowd cheered once again, and when Yell had finally stopped shaking and looked up at the man who had his sword pointed at him, he noticed he wasn’t looking at him.

’Is he looking at someone in the crowd, but I thought this man was blind.’ Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At that moment, Leo was looking directly at Chris, who was standing up, letting all of his Qi energy out as well.

"Looks like I’ve finally found you." They both said.
