What Quinn was thinking of doing was summoning his demon from, but there were a few reasons why he was against doing this. For one, Mundus was watching, if the form was powerful as he thought it was, he feared that the celestial might go back on his deal and consider him too much of a threat.

In a way, it was true as well considering Quinn wasn't in control when using this power. The only reason why he was fine with using it now, was because none of his family, friends, or even other life forms were around apart from the phoenix.

The second reason was because it was a wild card. It wasn't a guaranteed win and could possibly do nothing against the phoenix.

'Do I really want my final moments to be this... a memory that I can't even remember?' Quinn thought as he hesitated. 'But I shouldn't be thinking like that, I should be thinking with the mindset that I'll win, that I will return to my family!'

About to act, Quinn noticed something around the phoenix, now that he had taken a step back he could see something he wasn't able to see before.

_____

That very family that Quinn was thinking about, that he was fighting for, and doing everything in his power to protect, had decided to leave the Mermerial planet. Ceril, Russ, Stark, Layla, Minny and Galen were now all aboard a ship.

They were in the middle of heading to the Amra planet to discuss political matters and ask for help. Layla wanted to take one less thing off his mind. If this was what he was going to do anyway, then there was no point wasting time waiting for Quinn to come back.

Ceril had also received permission to act on behalf of the Mermerial race to book an appointment, and it was the same for Stark as well, who had just managed to contact the Penswi before leaving the planet.

Apparently they had quite a surprise for a certain someone, and Russ was currently enjoying the nice surprise.

Lying out on a table was a case, and inside the case, there were three crystals carefully placed inside. They weren't just any crystals though, all three of them were nest crystals.

"How did you manage to get so many so fast?" Layla asked, completely stunned.

"Our people are hard and fast workers. Everything we do, we put our full speed into it, so of course we will gather crystals faster than any other planet. I take pride in that!" Stark said, as he hit his chest around 10 times in less than a second.

At one point and time the nest crystals were so hard to come by, they had done so much for them. Saved Quinn's life, elongated Logan's and had created a permanent clone of Vincent.

'With these three crystals, how much stronger will I be? If I was to meet the Blades again, could I take them out. Or perhaps that Dalki Blade, Quinn called him, in that vision.' Russ smiled to himself.

When going forward to reach out one of the crystals, a small boy had hopped onto the table and grabbed the crystal before Russ could take it.

"That's mine!" Russ shouted. "Give that back before I turn you into mush!"

The one holding onto the crystal was none other than little Galen who shook his head.

"Did you just threaten my son, right in front of me?" Layla asked, as she levitated a cup in the air, and went to throw it at Russ's head, but with a quick zip, Stark had caught the glass.

"Come on everyone, let's calm down here, we are all friends right, people say things in anger, everything is okay." Stark smiled.

Russ still wasn't pleased that his nest crystal had been taken from him, but he had no choice but to play nice, since he had the Qi command skill still active in his head.

"Little Quinn." Russ called out.

"Galen, his name is Galen!" Minny corrected him.

"Okay, little Galen, do you mind giving me my crystal back?" Russ asked with a fake smile that could be seen from a mile away.

Galen once again shook his head, and the next second shadows covered the crystal before it disappeared.

"What the!" Russ stared at Galen and then back at Layla, who just shrugged her shoulders. Due to the comment he had made before, she wasn't going to help him with something like this.

'This damned whole Talen family!' Russ screamed in his head. 'If there is some way to get rid of this Qi command... then that kid better watch out! Thinking of it, I wonder what would happen, if Quinn were to die, would the Qi command disappear then? I wonder if he's having a hard time right now.'

Observing from a little further away, Quinn could see something happening. The passing flaming clouds, the heat from the planet, the flare shots that would whirl around, they were going toward the phoenix.

When it reached its body, there was almost a slight glow, and at the same time, a slight rise in the temperature as well.

'While fighting against it... I thought I was having an effect because when I would deliver a big blow the temperature would drop slightly... but then it would increase again. Wait, why does the phoenix terraform every planet that it's on.

'I thought it was just a natural effect of the beast, but what if it's something more. The flames, the entire planet is similar to how blood is to me.

'Blood allows myself to heal, and the flames are allowing the phoenix to heal as well, but the whole planet is close to being a big ball of fire... so what do I need to do? Do I move it to another planet?

'It hasn't moved from that mountain spot though, and there probably is some reason for that as well. It might be the point where it can heal easiest or something. With the god slayer's powers they can transport beings.

'So if they just transported the phoenix to another planet and fought it then, that's probably how they managed to win.'

Thinking of this, it gave Quinn a plan, there was one thing he could do, and there was a high chance that it wouldn't work but either way he had to be quick. Placing both hands in front he was ready.

A large portal of shadow appeared behind the phoenix from head to toe and its whole body vanished. Mundus stood up, surprised by what was happening but he could no longer see Quinn either.

This was because the two of them were now in the shadow space together.

'Due to its high level of power, it could break out of the shadow space without a problem, and with its flaming body it would just lessen the amount of MC cells I could use while it was in here... but now the big bird can't heal.'

Quinn used nitro accelerate once more and leapt up, punching the large bird right across its face. Immediately the temperature lowered and sparks of flames went off from the phoenix disappearing.

The phoenix had slightly gotten smaller, but it still looked like there was quite a bit or work to do in here.

"It's a good thing that I'm not the only one in here, and not the only one that can use the shadow... let's finish this thing."Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

Mundus travelled down to where Quinn was fighting, he was searching where the two could be, and eventually had come to a conclusion that it was one of the many powers of the shadow that he had used.

'It looks like he finally managed to figure it out. I wonder if he had done so in time.' Mundus thought.

A few moments later he had received his answer, as Quinn had come out from his shadow space. He was covered in sweat and his skin looked a bit red for the first time, but he had a crystal in his hand.

"Alright... that's two down."
