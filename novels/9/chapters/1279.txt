Chapter 1280 - A Familiar Person

Quinn couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. Another Demon tier beast had appeared on the island or more accurately in the sea. What's more, it seemed to be a beast he was all too familiar with.

When first coming to the island, he had run into it and it had ended up demolishing Logan's precious submarine. On their second visit, Quinn had seen Mona tame the beast, a feat so amazing that she might be the only one able to achieve such a thing, with the exception of Sil perhaps, but he clearly remembered that the Kraken had not been a Demon tier beast at the time.

The confusing part was that Mona had once claimed that she didn't think it possible for her to be able to control a Demon tier beast, due to the way her ability worked. She only had enough MC cells to control a Demi-god tier beast, with perhaps a few lower tier ones on top of that.

After learning that beasts like Muddy and Tails could evolve, it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that the Kraken beast could evolve as well, however Quinn would have thought that in that case it should have broken free from Mona's control. Fortunately, the one beside him decided to solve that mystery for him.

"Mona's role in this war had always been bigger than she could ever imagine." Eno proceeded to explain, while they all continued to watch her fight off the incoming spaceships‚Ä¶ "I took her in to make sure she would be able to fulfill her role, the only thing she really needed was some guidance.

"People often believe to know everything there is to know about their own ability, especially one passed down in a family, but those are usually the ones who lack creativity. When it comes to abilities, it never hurts to try and think outside the box."

"For example, once a beast has been put under control using the taming ability, a link will have already been established between the tamer and the beast. No matter how strong the beast gets or how weak she would grow, there is no getting out for the beast unless the controller either wills it so‚Ä¶ or dies."

"In most instances, it's easier to capture a higher tier beast to grow stronger than to evolve one. On the other hand, how many could claim to be able to get a Demi-god tier beast under their control in the first place. Once captured it was worth the investment to make it evolve." Eno finished his explanations.

The others hearing this, were amazed that they had an actual Demon tier beast fighting on their side. Even faced with the large number of enemies in front of them, they now felt some confidence that perhaps they weren't as doomed as they had come to believe.

Losing the teleporter had been a bitter pill to swallow, not only because it had cut off their path of retreat, but also because they could no longer expect any backup from Sil, one of their strongest members. They all knew how much of a blow this was to the team, so the realization that Eno had prepared something none of them had ever considered was very reassuring.

Unfortunately, despite Mona doing her best to get rid of as many of those ships exiting those portals, there were just far too many for her and the Kraken to deal with on their own. It didn't take long for a number of them to make it past her.

Seeing this, the others were preparing to use their abilities to knock the ships out of the sky, or block the incoming energy blasts that were able to be shot out from the ships. At the moment, the group could see two different types of ships they could make out, one larger but slower, the other faster and more mobile.

The former seemed to be dropships similar to the ones the Graylash group had used when they had gone up against the Sunshield family, unless modified they should have around two dozen people inside. The latter were obviously ones meant to attack, fast and agile with one or two pilots inside. Although Mona had concentrated on taking them out, currently a group of them was heading straight for the castle, their energy blasters ready to fire.

In total, six ships had managed to get past the Kraken, their blasters could be seen charging up, but before any of the Cursed faction could make their move, a gust of wind could be felt and the next second, a large shadow was cast over them all.

"The‚Ä¶the Dragon!" Layla called out. She had her bow ready but quickly put it down when she could only see its back.

The small ships fired their energy blasts, but the Demon tier beast didn't even show any signs that it had noticed being hit. It seemed indifferent to the attacks and once it was close enough it opened its maw wide to reveal an orange light from behind its fangs.

The next second a stream of fire came bursting out, engulfing two of the ships in flames. When the Dragon stopped its fire breath the small ships could no longer be seen. Normally, at least a few parts would have fallen to ground, yet it was as if it had just disappeared, not even leaving behind any ash.

The Dragon didn't stop there, using its large tail in lightning fast manner it struck three other ships down, and with a flap of it's giant wing, one of the ships was thrown off balance before it crashed into it with its giant jaw.

The six small spaceships were no match at all for the giant Demon tier beast. After getting rid of the little flying annoyances that had entered its flight space, the Dragon seemed to have calmed down, returning to its apparently favorite location. When it landed it shook the whole castle that the Cursed group were on.

"Well, it looks like as long as we have him on our side, we won't lose this fight!" Fex exclaimed, in amazement. It was nice knowing that a beast they had once run from with their lives on the line was now on their side.

As quickly as things had started to look up though, they also started to look down again.

Having learned from the mistakes of their predecessors, most ships had made the smart decision to fly around the area of the Kraken's current location. At the same time, due to the Dragon's performance, instead of flying over the island and angering the beast, the dropships had decided to land on the outer edges, allowing the people on board to safely get out. However, the forces didn't stop there, as several underwater boats that had been hiding, also came onto shore.

"They were in the sea as well!" Nate shouted, seeing as one of the ships opened, and several people were seen coming out from the ship.

From a distance, the others couldn't tell if they were human or vampires, but Quinn could use his Inspect skill and he was quite surprised about the outcome, for there were a mixture of vampires and humans among the attackers.

All of the men that had come out were wearing a black mask that covered their faces, with only slits over their eyes, so it was impossible for anyone but Quinn to tell at a glance. There seemed to be one human for every twenty or so vampires.

'How have they managed to gather this many forces? Wasn't Jim supposed to be a vampire who broke off on his own? Even if he somehow managed to take control over all the spies sent out by the vampires, would they really amount to this many?' Quinn thought.

Something wasn't adding up, and he knew the one who would know the answer. In the first place, where were their own reinforcements? Sure, the teleporter had just been destroyed, but what about all the clones that Eno had spread around the place?

"Their forces are far larger than what we had estimated. We need to proceed with the plan instead of just looking at what is happening." Sam rallied the Cursed group, trying to knock everyone out of their daze. "They are attacking from all over the island, and will slowly be coming forward. We need to stick to the plan and start it now!"

"How are we meant to proceed with the plan when there's only us?" Linda questioned him. "We need to come up with another idea, otherwise their numbers will simply overwhelm us. There has to be thousands of them while we number less than twenty, and I'm sure they have some strong ones among them."

Gritting his teeth, Sam had to admit that their plan wasn't looking too feasible right now. If only they could somehow coordinate their attacks with the Dragon‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, if that would have been that easy, Eno wouldn't have had to work together with the Cursed faction, in hopes of Sil taking control over the Demon tier beast.

Without him, not only was it impossible but also risky. What's more, if their enemies were attacking with this many people, they surely had to have some trump card that would allow them to deal with the Demon tier beast‚Ä¶

So while it was in the centre of the island, they had to stop anyone from getting close.

"I might not have a way to overpower them, but I have something that should be able to slow them down." Quinn said. "Do you think that will be enough for the rest of you to proceed with the plan as you originally intended? I'm sorry that I wasn't there when you were discussing the plan earlier, but I was doing something important." Quinn said, holding onto the amulets and closing his eyes, before he mumbled.

"I'll leave this side to you then."

Taking Full Control, Quinn saw everything that the Roseus tree did, making it easy for him to lead the army of beasts where they were needed.

As for the one controlling his body at the moment, it was none other than Vincent. Opening his eyes, 'Quinn' now gave off a different vibe.

"Tell me, what I need to do." Vincent requested. ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

'It's that other person‚Ä¶ again.' Layla noticed, but she wasn't the only one to have noticed something.

'This‚Ä¶ 'person' isn't Quinn right now‚Ä¶ but why do I get a familiar feeling from him?' Eno wondered.
