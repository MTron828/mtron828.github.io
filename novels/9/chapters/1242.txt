Chapter 1243 A message to them

The forest with the dark purple leaves could sometimes seem endless, with the terrain changing very little for Erin and Leo. Mountains, small rivers, lakes, ponds, and of course, trees, plenty, plenty of trees.

Although the two of them wished to stay near the vampire settlement, Erin's senses improved by the day. Each time, they were able to head out further from the settlement, and Erin could still sense the general direction of where the vampires were. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This was something unique to her as a dhampir. At the same time, it seemed like she was controlling her powers better, but control wasn't the only thing she was getting good at.

They had ventured further out because the vampires in the area now seemed non-existent. What surprised them as they did this was that even as they further explored the planet, there would always be a stray out there somewhere.

Some of them were minding their own matters, just wishing to live a life away from the settlement. They chose to leave them alone while others were running away from crimes they had committed.

The second they saw Leo and Erin, they thought they were from the settlement and had come to chase them down. Still, Leo didn't kill them instantly, or at least he didn't make it so Erin would because he wanted to find out more about them. Find out their reason for leaving. With his influence skill as a vampire knight, there weren't many that could resist his control.

The rivers had become a frequent place for the two of them to stop at. For some reason, the sound of the water running down was calming for both of them. Sitting on top of a stone, Leo was observing, more so with his ears.

With the sound of the river, chains could be heard and then shortly after, the sound of the wind being cut. This repeated several times with certain gaps of sound in between. As if someone was going through specific steps.

Each time this was repeated, not a single time did the pattern not repeat in the exact matter. It was perfect, again and again until finally, the pattern was off.

'The timing, it was off.'

"Stop!" Leo shouted.

Instantly, chains fell to the floor, and huffing and panting from Erin could be heard.

"You have done remarkably well. When we came here, I only wanted to help you control the energy inside you, but it looks like you have been able to achieve more than that." Leo complimented her. "Creating your own swordsmanship, one that incorporates the suppression chains, is no easy matter. You have done well creating these 6 different movements.

"You have nearly perfected them. However, there is one thing that we can't fix," Leo said, looking at his own blade.

When fighting the four spiked Dalki, he saw how effective agent 1's weapons were against it. Leo's weapon wasn't weak, but it was granted a boost in power due to the curse it had on it. This only helped when fighting against the Dalki, but even against a four spike, the boost wasn't enough.

"I have the Demi-god tier crystal that had been given to me by that man we met. I would like you-"

"No." Erin interrupted Leo. "Leo, you have your own goal, and to do that, you need stronger weapons as well. We know that Pure's leader is most likely your old master from what you have told me.

"I'm sure you have heard the rumours as well as I have. That Pure has a Demon tier weapon in their possession. I know your skills are great Leo, I know you are strong. Unfortunately, I think this just is something skill can't overcome. Besides, I haven't finished the move set yet. I plan for there to be 12 movements altogether."

Leo was taken aback by this. Erin's progression had been extraordinary. Her strength had grown fast, to the point where now it was nearly at his own. However, there were a few things Leo still had an advantage of Erin in. His control of Qi was more fine-tuned, while at the same time, he had experience. His fighting sense and tactics were above hers, but Erin was young, and this could be improved.

When she had told Leo she was going to create her own swordsmanship style, he was impressed, and when she actually achieved it, he didn't think he could be surprised again, yet here they were.

"From the vampires, the Bloodsuckers we have killed so far, we have gathered all different types of Blood crystals. Learning how to use the Katana-style sword with the suppression chains will be the first six moves, and I plan to have a weapon created from their blood crystals.

"I can finally help the others in the Cursed faction. When I first was sent to Pure, I hated it, I thought why me, but slowly I realised that Quinn, Layla. All of them saved my life from Truedream, and then they saved me again. It's time to return the favour.

"However, I don't want to forget my past either. The longsword I used to use, and the swordsmanship that was taught to me by my parents. I wish to improve it, and I plan to create another set of six movements for that weapon. That will be my beast weapon."

Hearing this, Leo thought it represented Erin quite well, to have one best weapon that the humans used and one blood weapon that the vampires used. The only thing was they didn't have the current weapons. For her, Longsword had broken.

"I think it's time we head back to the Cursed faction then. We can obtain the crystals needed for this and ask Alex to forge us both new weapons for our journey. It's been a long time." Leo smiled.

Heading back through the forest, they realised they were quite far out, and even with their speed, it would take around half a day to return, but before they could even move from the river, they sensed two large objects coming their way.

Crashing in front of the two stones were chucked into the river, and small waves were made pushing it over the edge. A great wind force had hit both of them.

'What happened? If they were vampires, I should have sensed them from a mile away.' Erin thought.

Leo had quickly drawn his sword. Now they were in front of them, he knew what they were.

"They are in a place like this!"

"Who would have thought that we would see two stray vampires all the way out here at a place like this." One of the attackers said.

"I bet they were surprised to see our return but too bad you won't be telling anyone anything." The other said.

The two that had appeared in front of them were Dalki. The Dalki had arrived on the vampire planet, but what were they doing so out of the settlement.

When both Erin and Leo had seen the number of spikes on the back, they weren't worried at all, for there was only one.

"I've been waiting, waiting for a while to do this!" Erin said as she went in for the attack.

It was safe to say that neither of the Dalki's had lasted very long, and both of their heads were seen rolling on the floor.

After dealing with the Dalki, they both continued to head to the vampire settlement. It was safe to say they didn't have a clue why the Dalki were there, but they had decided to head back towards the settlement to see if something was up.

They could have tried to find where the Dalki had come from, but so far out, they thought it was a risk. At the same time, Leo wanted to know more before doing anything. This perhaps would be a matter where they would need to contact Quinn as well.

When they finally were coming close to the settlement, the two wore their cloaks covering up their faces and heads. There were guards stationed outside the settlement and even in the forest area, which they hadn't seen before. Regardless, for Erin and Leo, it was easy to bypass them without being seen, using the terrain of the trees and more.

'Could it be that the Dalki really have attacked the settlement as well?' Leo thought.

However, when they entered the settlement, there was a strange feeling coming from the people. They could hear whispering and moans from everyone.

"What do we do! What do we do!"

"This has never happened before, and they managed to get inside!"

"Who could be strong enough to even do such a thing!"

The people were in a panic.

"Is it what we saw before?" Erin asked Leo, not wanting to say the name of the creatures in case someone had overheard them.

"No, this seems to be something different. The people look to be moving towards a certain place, and there are no signs of an attack. Let's follow them and see." Leo replied.

Following the crowds of people, they could see that some of the vampires had tears in their eyes. Others were shaking as they moved back.

"Everyone stand back, from the third castle! Get away from the third castle. This is an order!" A group of vampires shouted.

Seeing who they were, one could see that they were the Royal guard. A group of fifty or so vampires that worked directly under the king. They had the same power as a vampire knight. Currently, Ten of them were marching through, heading towards the third castle.

When Leo and Erin finally went there, they could see what everyone was looking at. From the pooling area, just outside the third castle inner area, one could see the whole castle in view. At the very top, the leader Suzan Toppy had been pinned using stakes to the wall. Her blood dripped on the castle walls, and there was no sign of life from her.

It was very clear that the third leader had been killed, and someone wanted to make sure that everyone knew about it.
