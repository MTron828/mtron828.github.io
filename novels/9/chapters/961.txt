Chapter 962 - Reliving the past

On his way back to his class, Quinn’s anger had calmed down a bit. However, his main worry was he wasn’t quite sure about what he had just done. He wondered if it would even act as a deterrent for the students to stop fighting.

He knew from experience that even if a teacher gave a telling off to the students directly, they would just carry on doing the same thing again and again. As long as there was no real punishment for those students, then this would just carry on happening.

The school would never expel the students as long as they had an ability that was deemed needed.

’Should I talk to Oscar about it? But could he even do something? What would be the best course of action?’ Quinn wondered and had finally entered his classroom once again.

Hayley had done quite a good job taking over, as she stood in front of the class. Everyone seemed to be keenly listening in on her, and he wanted her to continue while he was trying to think of something, but as soon as he entered, all the students’ eyes were on him and they were far too distracted.

So instead, Quinn walked to the front.

"Thank you Hayley, for covering for me," Quinn said and turned to the students. "I just wanted to talk to you all. What happened today with your fellow classmates is not okay. Maybe you have seen it happen many times before, but why should people get hurt just because they have been put in an unfavourable position.

"If there are any incidents like today, or if any of you get hurt, I want you to tell me. If you can’t confide in me, then confide in Hayley here. She might be good at healing the wounds on the outside, but we can’t see the wounds on the inside."

There was silence after Quinn’s speech from the students, as they didn’t really know what or how to reply.

’Hey, you’re getting a bit cheesy with your speeches Quinn, what do you want them to say?’ Vincent said, trying to tease him a little, but knew Quinn meant well with his words.

Luckily, the students didn’t have to react to what had just been said, because the bell had gone off, and it was time for their final lesson of the day. For Quinn as well, it was time for him to go ahead and teach his beast weapon class.

Some students from his class, couldn’t help but talk about how strange Quinn was acting and how strange he was as well. It was weird because it seemed like he was even more caring about certain things than his parents. The sad truth was, this wasn’t unusual either.

The kids’ parents knew that even if their child were getting abused, they were unable to do anything about it. Usually the ones that did the bullying, wasn’t due to lack of self confidence, it was the opposite, they were overconfident and knew they could get away with it.

Usually, this also stemmed from their parents that acted the same way.

Taking a shortcut, Quinn decided to run ahead, out of sight to where the beast weapons class would take place. Seeing the large temple-like building, Quinn could tell it was modelled after the one that Leo had taught in as well.

Only this building was around four times the size. After all, it had to accommodate more students. The good news was that there were also several teachers. For example, Quinn wasn’t the only one that would be teaching the beast weapons class. He was only to teach it to the students that were in the Cursed house.

He entered the large white room, which gave off the illusion it was bigger than it seemed, and the wall was filled with all kinds of beast weapons. Looking at them all, Quinn used his inspect skill and he could see the stats of every single item in the room.

"This really does bring back memories, it would have been a lot easier if my inspect skill was this strong back then as well." Quinn thought, rather than going around and inspecting every single weapon. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Before the students arrived, Quinn decided to shadow equip his gauntlets and boots onto the rest of his body. So he looked more suitable to at least be teaching the class and soon, the students started to pour into the room.

"As you enter the room, could you please select a space and don’t let anyone get within a meter of you." Quinn instructed. "This will be your space and remember it well."

Eventually, the room started to fill up and it looked like there were over a hundred and fifty students inside. There would have been more, but Quinn had seen some students step into the room and when they saw who was teaching quickly left as if they were disappointed.

"Ah, it’s taught by him, maybe I should go to the elemental class instead." Some students spoke.

Students were free to go between classes for the first few weeks anyway, as they decided what they wanted to excel in, so Quinn didn’t really mind it.

What pleased him the most though, was the students from his very own class, had come right to the front where Quinn could see them. Venus and Swine were both looking at him carefully and staring at the equipment on his body. What was a surprise for Quinn, was that Shiro had entered as well, and was standing beside them.

’Oh, I thought since he wanted to be in the Graylash family he would have joined the elemental class, but I guess since he doesn’t have an ability there isn’t much he can do.’ Quinn thought.

"General Hardy, what level are those gauntlets on your arms?!" Swin asked. "I’ve never seen gauntlets so bright red before."

Quinn looked at them and realised he still had the emperor tier gauntlets on him. Although they had gathered some legendary tier crystals, they weren’t the right crystals to produce an ideal weapon for himself.

"I guess they do need an upgrade at some point, there at the emperor tier level." Quinn replied.

Hearing these words, Swin placed his hand on his c.h.e.s.t and grabbed Venus before he fell.

"Emperor tier! Does that mean you’ve fought against some emperor tier beasts before?" Venus asked.

Quinn didn’t mean to blurt out the first part, but the cat was out of the bag now about his weapons, so he just went ahead and nodded.

Of course, not all the students were as excited about this. If someone was capable of killing an emperor tier beast, they would have at least been known, however Hardy wasn’t. So they could only assume he was given those weapons, lying about them, or had fought with his faction to obtain them.

Students were shaking their heads, clearly regretting the choice they had made.

Now that all the students were ready, Quinn decided to start the lesson. He first went into explaining the different tiers there were and how some beast weapons had active abilities. Those that didn’t would still need to be activated to gain a stat boost from the items themselves however.

He briefly went over all of this information and soon gave a display. Touching the ground made of concrete with his fingertips, he made a fist. With just his strength alone and no abilities, he grabbed the concrete, leaving markings on the floor, making a ball.

In similar fashion to Leo. He had done the same thing as him. Saying to all the students that they were free to try all the weapons on the wall, to find which one suited them. The students quickly began to take weapons down from the wall and try them at will.

Walking around the room, Quinn kept a keen eye on a lot of them, and even at one point a stray whip looked like it was about to hit another. The student tried to pull it back but Quinn had caught it in time, before it had hit another.

"Woah, calm down a little there, make sure you know your surroundings. Think about it, if this was a fight you wouldn’t want to be hurting your own allies now, would you?" Quinn said.

The student apologised and went ahead to select another weapon. That’s when Quinn noticed that there was one student who hadn’t selected any weapons at all, and standing on his own, it was Shiro.

"Too much choice?" Quinn asked.

"I thought it would be best to pick a weapon that would go well with an ability, but since I don’t have an ability..." Shiro stopped there.

"Well, you can always change your weapon, you know? Or you could do something similar to me." Quinn said. "You know, one of the reasons I selected just gauntlets wasn’t because I was good at fighting with my fists. It was because even with them, if I wanted to I could grab and use another weapon."

Back then though, Quinn had mainly selected it due to it giving his bloodskills a boost, so he understood why Shiro was struggling. The more he started to remember about the past, the more Quinn was thankful for having the system.

"Teacher, I remember what you said before." Shiro replied. "About how you used to be a level one with no ability."

"I wanted to ask, did you ever get bullied?"

"Did I ever get bullied?" Quinn chuckled. "Of course I did. But back then there wasn’t anyone that would stick up for me. At least not at the beginning, but I found some people that helped me along the way, and I really meant what I said, I will help you as well."

Shiro’s hand was shaking slightly, as if he was holding back something. He wanted to speak but couldn’t and he soon ran off and went to grab one of the weapons off from the wall.

’That kid Quinn, reminds me a lot of you.’ Vincent said.

"I know, and that’s a problem."

———

Outside, not too far from the beast weapons class, a group of six students were patiently waiting.

"Are you sure they are in here?" One of them asked.

"Trust me, I have my connections," They said. Swim and Venus had signed up for the beast weapons class. Once this class is over it’s the end of the day, and this is the only path someone can take from the beast class to head back to the dorms. We need to make sure they learn to listen, so they never ever think about telling the teacher again."
