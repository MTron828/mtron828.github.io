Chapter 1024 - A dangerous man

The large Bertha ship didn’t land on the planet as they had expected. Instead, it stayed hovering in the sky like a giant island. However, smaller sh.i.p.s did depart and immediately descended to two locations in particular, the shelter and a short distance away where the fighting had taken place in the desert.

Support had arrived, only it was far too late and all the damage that could be done had already happened as the Dalki had been dealt with. Oscar had personally decided to arrive along with the support team.

It was the first full scale attack from the Dalki since the peace treaty and Oscar was pretty sure that after the investigations of what happened, that an announcement would have to be made to the whole human race - that they were in the middle of a war.

Inside the shelter a few medium sized sh.i.p.s had landed. Deboarding from the ship was Head General Sach and his trusted sergeants that were usually helping him organise his platoons when he was doing school duties.

What was noticeable about them, was that they had no beast weapons on them, but did have high level beast armour. Along with them each ship carried around twenty people and a total of twenty sh.i.p.s had landed in the shelter. More were to be sent from the large Bertha ship, but when they noticed that there was no longer any trouble, the other troops were sent away.

The first team had even carried with them the portable teleporters. They weren’t quite sure if they worked but if so, they could get others to escape or bring more support with them. What was interesting was that the teleporters started to work as soon as the Dalki were defeated.

The Head General, Samantha, and the Cursed members were ready to head out of the destroyed shelter, with Linda carrying Fex over her shoulder. That was until suddenly five sh.i.p.s had descended in the area. A male and female sergeant deboarded from one, while the captains and their squads rushed to Head General Samantha’s aid.

’That wasn’t too slow of a response from the military.’ Sam thought. ’But if we didn’t arrive and Fex wasn’t here, they could have lost a head general today.’

"Halt!" She stated. "No one is to leave this area. We are to take you to the emergency centre with the others and shall take your weapons. There you shall give a full report of what happened."

"Is this seriously happening right now?" Wevil said, as he looked at the others who just shrugged their shoulders.

Dennis tried moving forward and ignored them, but soon he found one of the men attempting to stop him. It was a larger man than Dennis, who looked strong and had tried to bully him back, but the second the man’s hand touched Dennis’ c.h.e.s.t, he grabbed it and threw the large man to the floor.

"What are you doing, are you disobeying orders right now!" She shouted as several men were preparing to fight.

"We don’t belong to the military. We work ’with’ you, not under you." Dennis said.

"He’s correct, we are part of the Cursed faction." Sam answered.

"Even so, we have to make a report and learn of what happened here. Surely the Cursed faction aren’t so foolish to not even know the basics of war." The sergeant replied.

Sam walked forward, unafraid of the person in front of him, it was the first time he had felt this way. Before becoming a vampire he had felt weak and powerless but something had sparked in him when he looked at the girl.

"Look. I don’t know if you know this, but someone very important to us is on this planet and doesn’t appear to be in this shelter. Until we know he is okay, we won’t listen to anyone’s orders. Not even the supreme commander himself." Sam said, as a single eye started to glow red, but before they completely turned, Nate cleared his throat, bringing his friend back to reality.

A shiver had gone completely down the sergeant’s spine, but still she wanted to make it clear that nobody could bully her, not when they had important duties to attend to, so she had planned to retaliate.

"Let them go." Samantha said from far away. She had received minor first aid by some healers and many of her injuries had recovered. "They can make a report when they come back. They are free to leave and make sure no one stops them. That’s an order." Samantha said.

Hearing this, Sam walked forward and the rest of the group followed as they left the shelter. As quick as they had arrived, they seemed to disappear just as quickly.

"Are you sure that was the right thing to do, Head General?" The sergeant asked.

"Yes." Samantha replied. "I know now what Oscar was talking about when he said we should be doing everything to get them on our side. The Cursed might be what we need if we have even a chance of winning this war." She then looked at the multiple dead two spiked Dalki.

It was clear that the forces they had used in the first war wasn’t everything they had, either that or they had evolved and gotten stronger.

Sam and the others had eventually arrived at where the other students and teachers were recuperating. Here several sh.i.p.s from the giant Bertha had landed as well and this was where Oscar had decided to arrive.

The students thought that those from the Cursed were either just travellers or more military personal, but then some of the students had recognised Wevil.

"Hey, isn’t he the one that helped us in the beast weapons lesson?" One of them commented.

"Wait, so are those people from the Cursed faction? It would make sense why they are here if their leader is here."

’Those are the guys from the Cursed? They don’t look impressive, I don’t even recognise any of them.’ Innu thought. ’They took over so many big name factions after taking over Daisy and the other beast planets, and they sent these guys to pick up their leader? If it was Owen, a whole platoon of the Graylash’ strongest would be sent and they would have made quite the entrance.’ Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Turning around, Oscar managed to catch his eye on one of the Cursed members and walked over to greet himself while his assistant stood by his side.

"It’s great to finally meet you in person after talking over video all this time. You’re a lot smaller than I thought." Oscar said, looking down at him.

"Do you know where our leader is?" Sam asked to keep it short, because he was afraid that something else might have been revealed other than Quinn’s true title.

"We don’t actually know much about that. I think it’s best if you talk to your other head general, Peter. He seems to know more and just said that he would return eventually." Oscar replied. "Before you go, I know you’re in a rush but I just want you to think about something. You seem like a smart and capable person based on our previous communications. You don’t have to answer me now, but why do you think the Dalki attacked this place?"

"I’ll be sure to think about it." Sam said as he walked off towards Peter.

Honestly Sam was already thinking about this question himself. He could see in person the amount of Dalki that had attacked. At first he thought that it might have been Eno’s doing, but from the information they had learnt from Brock it would make no sense for him to do that.

’Did the Dalki come here because they were after something, or someone? What if they were after Eno, maybe he’s been hiding on this planet this whole time and someone finally found him. Why would the Dalki be after him though?’

The second reason Sam could think of was more likely to be the answer, but he was worried if this was the case. Eno’s goal was to protect the demon tier beast that was on the Blade island. If he knew the Dalki were going to attack, did he use a plant? Maybe he gave fake information that the demon tier beast was here. It was quite possible he also knew the movements of Quinn. Tying the two things together he used it as a test for him, and a way to throw the Dalki off the real scent. If Quinn had failed, he still would have killed a lot of Dalki and their goal wouldn’t have progressed any further.

’If that’s the case, then Eno is a really dangerous man.’ Sam thought.
