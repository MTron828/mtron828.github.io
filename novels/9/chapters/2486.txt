Chapter 2487 Fight against the demon kings (Part 2)

The demon form of the demon kings, this was something that the Champions didn't even know too much about, but it was actually one's true form that each demon king had. As for the reason why they didn't just stay in that form all the time, it was due to the red energy in the air.

This was an order, and was forbidden, by Immortui himself. The full demon form would attract the red mist energy from all over, and he needed that to do its work, to do its thing, so the demons staying in their demon form for long periods of time would cause great problems for him.

Immediately after transforming, and now in front of the others, Bisha threw out his fist. He wasn't within range of the others, but the marking on his chest started to light up, and the red energy had gathered on top of his fist.

Exploding out of the air, heading towards them, it looked like a giant meteorite, this was far bigger than the objects that had been thrown from before, and looked a lot more powerful.

Not sure that, even with the armour, he would be able to take on the attack, Edvard moved out of the way, and Chris had done the same, transforming himself into his wolf form.

The large fist in the centre hit the ground and crushed everything in its path. The large giant waves that towered above them started to break and crumble, falling off bit by bit and falling into the area of the attack, turning into nothing.

Eventually the attack started to grow smaller and smaller in size, turning into nothing, but had left a path of destruction.

While avoiding the attack, Chris ran in his wolf form, and decided to head straight to the demon king.

'I'm faster than I was before, and I'm stronger which means that I can hit harder!'

Moments before reaching Bisha, Chris' body started to transform, and he created a Qi platform in the air. Even though his feet could touch the ground he had noticed something, the ground was unable to contain his strength.

When pushing off the ground it would break in the process making him lose some of his force, but when he used his Qi to create a platform to push off form it wouldn't break, giving him that extra boost.

Pushing off, his body had transformed back into that of a full werewolf, covered in red fur and he swiped right through Bisha's skin. His claws cut up the ankle of the leg. However, Chris' hand was small compared to Bisha's leg so it looked like nothing but a flesh wound.

'I know I'm still not strong enough to take him down with a punch, but if I put all the power into my claws, it can still rip into his skin!'

Chris didn't stop there, as he turned and continued to swipe, moving at an incredibly fast speed. Slashing with his claws, cutting at just the single foot of Bisha. It was almost a repeat of what Chris had done with his fight against Unzoku, only it was targeted to a single area this time rather than one's whole body.

Although they weren't large wounds, a tingling sensation could be felt in Bisha's foot and he knew if he didn't do something that it could cause him problems. Immediately, his fist lit up, and he went to throw a punch downward aiming for Chris.

With the power surging around the fist, the attack itself had turned enormous, nearly as big as when the ship was being used to attack them. The red energy all around was pushing downward along with the hand.

Regardless of this, Chris continued to attack at the leg, clawing it away, chucking off pieces of flesh to the side.

'He trusted me back then, so I will trust him now as well!' Chris thought.

The fist continued to come down, and from the side, Edvard had leapt up, he had both of his hands by his side. As the armour pulsated up from the toes, he threw out both of his hands, pulsating with power, it pushed the large arm to the side heavily.

Bisha's punch was thrown off course and nearly his whole balance as well. The fist had crashed into the ground, but it had done so next to Chris instead. The energy from the fist, had still hit him, crashing on top.

Covering his body with Qi, Chris gritted his teeth.

"ARGHHH!" he exclaimed, as he forcefully pushed, breaking out of the red mist. Immediately Chris powered through and went straight for the same foot again.

Bisha now was keeping an eye on the one that was able to produce such explosive power, and threw out his other hand releasing another meteorite of power. This was too close for Edvard to avoid, so he had no choice but to attempt to blast it back with his fist as well. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Throwing out an explosive punch, it hit the meteorite of energy but it didn't get pushed back, instead it was Edvard that was feeling the intense pain. Although the energy had entered inside him, on impact he felt a great pain on his whole body, causing blood to spew out of his mouth.

'F*ck this hurts!' Edvard thought.

With his other fist ready, he punched the meteorite power again, his feet were skidding across the ground now, but his arms and whole body was still being affected by the strange power.

Leaving one hand on the attack, he punched with his other fist, and then he would alternate doing this. He continued to punch and punch until it completely disappeared from his sight, breaking it apart.

"How‚Ä¶ is someone like you still alive!" Bisha shouted

His attack, which destroyed everything in its path, had not destroyed this small figure. The blood had poured out of Edvard's mouth and was now on his armour. He couldn't imagine taking a direct hit from the demon in this form, but it was something he needed to do.

Running forward, Edvard leapt in the air, with his fist ready, and matching it, Bisha had thrown out his fist as well. The two were ready to collide, that was until a large snap sound was heard, and suddenly Bisha's fist fell to the side and was going off target.

He looked to the ground, and he hadn't even felt what had happened. The flesh on his foot, it had been torn off completely, to the point where only his bone could be seen. Seeing this. Chris still hadn't stopped there, he continued to attack, and eventually broke the bone as well.

"Don't stop there, X marks the spot!" Chris shouted, as he dug his claws into the giant and started to run up its body. Bisha was still in the middle of falling, but he was ready to stick his stump into the ground.

Chris felt extremely alive, his claws pulsating with power and his Qi raging in him. As he ran up Bisha's chest, he swung his arm, his claws ripped through the skin, but then a large claw strike appeared, cutting off the flesh on his chest.

Chris then repeated the same with the other hand, tearing off another claw mark, making a large X shape, and it was right where Bisha's heart was.

With the flesh torn off and the muscle, the heart could clearly be seen beating in Bisha, it was an open target.

"That's a pretty clear target." Edvard smiled, his arms pulsating as he threw a punch directly in the chest. The power exploded and just like with the outer of the ship, a large hole went right through, having burst Bisha's heart completely.

The second demon king had been defeated.
