Kane's eyes narrowed. "Attempt to detain you?"

"Of course." Kaze smiled, "The mercenaries that tried killing me while I was having sex didn't meet such a kind fate. If you're attempting to kill me, bring missiles, not those toy guns."

The agent scoffed in disbelief. "You're an absurd individual. Soldiers, show this man we mean—"

A violent wave of crushing pressure washed over the room, dropping all of the soldiers to their knees, using their full willpower not to grab their necks.

Kane forced his head up to look at Kaze, who was gently smiling at the man struggling to breathe.

"I said bring missiles to [attempt] killing me, Mr. Ryker." The emperor said calmly, "It won't work, but it will at least show me respect. Now, are we talking business, or will you continue this insipid farce?"

"I… I… want… to… talk." The agent groaned between breaths.

"Good. I'm releasing my cultivation base." Kaze said coldly.

"If anyone of you attempts to strike, I'll kill everyone and contact your general with a video of you trying to kill me. I assure you, gentlemen; your deaths will be in vain."

Kane followed the emperor's finger and saw the video camera on the ceiling. He knew at that moment that he had messed up on multiple fronts.

Kaze released his cultivation base, and everyone gasped for breath. Daniel was the least troubled, as he had a sky-grade cultivation technique, but even he was gasping.

"Okay, let's start again." The emperor began coldly, "You want cultivation techniques, and I can supply them to you for a price. I'm sure you came here to discuss that before you walked in acting like unlicked cubs, yes?"

Kane took deep breaths. He didn't want to represent the government with weakness. However, he was rattled by the previous event. "Yes, that's what we're here to do."

"It seems we're getting somewhere." Kaze remarked brazenly, "I will provide military-grade projectile earth-grade techniques in exchange for military protective equipment for my faction."

The agent's eyes widened in surprise. He didn't expect him to ask for military resources, which the man came to present. "What type of equipment?"

"Communications equipment, tactical suits for my faction members, reinforcement supplies, turrets, and two low-flying drones for the first technique, Guided Arrow." The emperor replied bluntly.

Kane stared at the man in disbelief. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. While it wasn't a problem, he didn't understand why the man wanted the equipment.

"Why do you want such equipment?" He asked inquisitively.

"I have the most conspicuous organization in the world." Kaze explained.

"Once it's confirmed that the ability to circulate Qi causes the sickness, millions of people will attempt to find this place.

I need self-defense equipment in case people become violent."

Kane closed his eyes and took a deep breath to control his emotions. "In other words, you also seek the right to protect yourself with impunity?

"Hoh? It seems you haven't failed to understand." The emperor said with a slight smile.

"While I understand the value of your offer, Mr. Lexicon, that's a rather audacious ask. Don't you agree?" The agent asked with sharp brown eyes.

"Of course it is, gentlemen." Kaze replied while putting an ankle over his left leg, "That's why I'm offering you something of exponentially more value."

Kane's ears perked up. "Is this Guided Arrow that powerful?"

"It is. If you can use it." The emperor chuckled.

The agent's eyes widened. "In other words, you're also offering a cultivation technique for mass distribution?"

"'Correct." Kaze replied, "I'm also offering the government an easy-to-learn Mortal Grade cultivation technique to mass-distribute to the citizens.

Surely, the government sees the value in ignoring laws when if they can acquire something to reign in the rampant mass lawlessness, yes?"

Kane swallowed nervously. There was far more on the table than he was planning to obtain. He had only arrived to force cooperation with the government, not negotiate a deal.

Moreover, the emperor touched on a weak point. They couldn't fault him for breaking laws when law and order were breaking down as they spoke.

"I'm assuming that you seek more in compensation for three techniques?" Kane asked discerningly.

"Only for the government to smooth through the establishment of Immortal Skye." Kaze smiled.

"Ignoring customs for our airships or flying our faction members here, stonewalling legal issues from backers, and the like.

Also, I'm requesting anti-missile systems. As attacking Immortal Skye after receiving such valuable techniques would be an unforgivable breach of our agreement.

Considering they're strictly for defense and thus cannot cause the government harm, that's more than a respectable ask.

It's also an assurance that prevents conflict between our parties."

The agent's eyes glided to the left in thought and then back, locking eyes with the emperor.

"Please, provide me with a list of equipment you seek and a video of the cultivation techniques." Kane requested."

Someone of a higher rank will arrive to negotiate the details. I am not in the position to provide you with your asks, let alone the anti-missile systems."

The emperor nodded. "Very well. Is there anything else you gentlemen need?"

"No, this is what we came for." Kane replied, shaking his head, "Thank you for your time, Mr. Lexicon."

"It was my pleasure." Kaze replied sarcastically, "Daniel, please show the agents out."

Kane gave him a wry smile and walked out of the room but stopped in the hall.

"Mr. Lexicon. I'm warning you; don't threaten my superiors." He requested, "You may have power, but we can halt your operation, cutting it off from the world."

Kaze laced his fingers and leaned back, his ankle still resting on his thigh.

"And that, Mr. Ryker, is why you stockpile ten tons of non-perishable food, water, and living supplies before the government contacts you."

Kane gritted his teeth in anger. "[Please] don't threaten my supervisor."

"Then bring someone with real influence." Kaze laugh-scoffed, "I only respect those with power, as they have the authority to act and aren't a waste of time. Make sure to relay that to your superiors."

The agent exhaled in exasperation but bit his tongue and walked away bitterly. He couldn't ruin such an important deal.

Kaze continued operations that day with Daniel, setting up the living arrangements and organizing the command structure.

Around midnight, his eyebrow twitched in irritation after opening his eyes from a cultivation session and seeing that Evalyn still hadn't messaged him.

However, he noticed that she did message him later in the day, but he didn't see it.

Sky Pheonix: Maryworth Hospital in Lanberry. Mother and Father are admitted. I know you won't help, and I won't ask you to. I won't leave without my mom.

You: If it's only your mom, have her transferred here immediately if you want to suffer. No negotiations. Keep a low profile, you foolish woman.

Sky Pheonix: I have to stay for the night until the government can clear my mom for leaving.

—

His eyebrow twitched in irritation again.

—

You: You didn't prepare a power play ahead of time? Have you lost your mind? Leverage anything at your disposal to get her out of there.

You: The military is negotiating a deal. So leave your uncle out of it unless you want your mom to be a chess piece on day one.

—

Four hundred miles away at Maryworth Hospital in Lanberry, Evalyn's phone beeped with a special tone, letting her know that Kaze had messaged her.

The blonde gulped when she heard it. After a moment's thought, she reached out to grab it but stopped when she saw the blood on her shaky hands.

She sat back down for a moment and let tears fall from her eyes, attempting to clear her mind from the events she had just experienced.

While Evalyn didn't have a problem speaking, she didn't know if she could face Kaze, who provided her with so much, yet she couldn't follow simple directives.

After taking a deep breath, she steadied her hands and read the text.

—

You: The military is negotiating a deal. So leave your uncle out of it unless you want your mom to be a chess piece on day one.

—

Tears welled in Evalyn's eyes when she looked at her mom. The woman was under an anesthetic due to the Qi Sickness symptoms.

Dark bruises around her neck showcased the results of her father attempting to strangle her to death in a rage. The symptoms only magnified his already aggressive nature.

p Evalyn hit reply, and dry swallowed nervously.

—

You: My mom is under an anesthetic for the night. Without my uncle pulling strings, I cannot move her, as she cannot travel.

—

She waited for five minutes.

Ten.

After an hour and a half, she finally gave up waiting for him to reply. However, the phone lit up again.

—

Kaze <3: Your mother is jeopardizing the lives of thousands. So remember that before you fail to use your head again.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Evalyn looked at the blood on her hands and shoes with trembling eyes. Tears fell from her eyes, dropping to the floor, diluting the blood prints on the ground.
