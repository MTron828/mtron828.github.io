Kiera's heart raced as she glanced around the room, filled with the last people she had expected to see gathered in one place: Marilyn, Kylie, Addison, and Fey. Her discomfort stemmed not from the individuals themselves but from the presence of another person who seemed out of place in Kaze's secret harem den ‚Äì Evalyn Skye.

The others shared Kiera's anxiety, anticipating a confrontation with the formidable matriarch as if awaiting the reaper's judgment. Today was that day.

Fey appeared the most apprehensive, having not fully committed to Kaze but finding herself there nonetheless, making her long for mercy. Yet, as Kaze stood with a subtle smile, no one dared to speak up, the only beacon in these dark times.

They sat in Kaze's underground harem den and bar within Immortal Skye, highlighting the importance of privacy.

Tension filled the air.

Hearts raced.

Breaths were held.

"With only one week left before the gate opens and we face Killian's forces," Evalyn began, her voice strained, "this is a time of great stress and need, a time to protect and support one another."

The women listened, their breaths ragged.

"For this reason," Evalyn exhaled, "we must accept each other... as a harem."

Shock reverberated throughout the room.

"W-Wh-wh-Wh-WAIT!" Kiera exclaimed. "Hold the phone, pull out the video camera, check for signs of mental manipulation, take two steps back, and gasp. Did you really just say that?"

Evalyn's eyebrow twitched, but she couldn't bring herself to be angry with Kiera. "Yes, I said that," she confirmed.

Marilyn, ignoring Fey's blush, asked, "Why now?"

"Because I don't want to trample over you for Kaze's love or be trampled on in return," Evalyn explained, her voice wavering but resolute. "There are benefits to accepting each other, like emotional support, camaraderie, and strength. But there are no benefits to resentment, disregarding our feelings, or competing for Kaze's attention."

Fey hesitated before asking, "Does this mean that I'm now part... of this harem?"

Evalyn sighed. "Only if you choose. I won't offer this again, so the decision is yours."

The others shared their willingness to accept the new arrangement, except Kiera, whose silence spoke volumes. But under the weight of everyone's gaze, her resolve crumbled.

"I've accepted you, wifey one," Kiera swallowed. "You're the reason that we're here. I couldn't take something so precious to Kazey away from him. I also don't hate the other nymphnuggets, but‚Ä¶."

Evalyn interrupted, "Kiera, you don't have to be intimate with anyone but Kaze. I'll never ask you to do that and will defend you against anyone who does."

Kiera flushed, feeling vulnerable and exposed.

Marilyn inquired about Evalyn's insistence on group intimacy. With a wry smile, Evalyn replied, "Do you think we'll treat sharing a bed like a sleepover and take turns? If I accept everyone, I do so with the promise of pleasure as well."

Surprise mingled with excitement filled the room.

Evalyn and Kiera were gatekeepers. Evalyn held power over all, save Kiera, Kaze's undisputed emotional favorite. They allowed Evalyn to have Kaze at a moment's notice and reserved three days a week for Kiera. The prospect of having him nightly was enticing, though it meant forgoing one-on-one time and sharing with Kiera and Evalyn.

"I'm grateful to be here, so I'm okay with whatever we decide," Marilyn stated. Addison clapped enthusiastically, and Kylie agreed but clarified she would sleep with her siblings until they were strong enough to protect themselves.

Evalyn nodded. "We'll work out the details later."

"If I join, it will be under these conditions," Fey chimed in, her face flushed. "So don't worry about me."

No one pressed her to elaborate further, understanding the implications of her statement.

Kiera's eyes shimmered with a mix of emotions until Evalyn spoke up again.

"Kiera will have one night alone with Kaze, regardless of circumstances," Evalyn conceded. "Only her; I'm not asking for the same. She does more than enough to deserve this."

The others looked at Kiera with expressions blending genuine affection and envy. Yet, they all agreed, causing Kiera's face to redden as she longed to escape.

"With only five days left," Evalyn reminded them, "we need to muster all our strength. Let's do everything we can to build that strength this week."

Kiera's eyes widened in panic. "Wait up, hold up, quick pause‚Äî"

"If everyone consents as they claim to, we should dual cultivate together," Evalyn interrupted, rolling her eyes at the teen. "It'll strengthen our bonds and teamwork, build our strength, and‚Ä¶ feel‚Ä¶ very good."

Every eye in the room fell upon Kaze, who responded with a self-assured smirk as if to say, do you doubt me? The women exchanged amused glances, their faces a mixture of intrigue and uncertainty.

After some light-hearted banter and a bit of teasing aimed at Kiera, they finally reached a consensus.

"You're free to leave if you'd like, Fey," Kaze said, his gaze resting on his brunette professor. "However, you're welcome to stay and become part of my harem, devoting yourself to me. It is the time for the harem, after all."

Following a few moments of hesitation, Professor Fey sighed. "I can't deny my desires," she admitted, feeling the intense scrutiny of the others as if they could see her innermost thoughts. "I'll devote myself to you, as long as everyone accepts."

"You're alive: hashtag proof of acceptence," Kiera grumbled, folding her arms and looking away, clearly displeased with the idea of sharing Kaze.

"Kiera's acceptance is like the final stamp of approval. You have everyone's support," Marilyn chimed in, her words echoed by Addison and Kylie.

"Welcome to the harem, Fey," Evalyn said with a warm smile, even though her heart felt like it was tied in knots. She struggled to maintain the facade of a welcoming member of the harem.

Deep down, Evalyn knew she and the others would eventually come to accept and appreciate their unique situation, but for now, her emotions mirrored Kiera's. Yet, one thing gave her the strength to carry on: love and pleasure.

The time was ticking down before they would have a spiritual connection and feel emotional and physical pleasure so intense that they'd accept each other to keep it alive forever. Her dreams told her that it was something that could turn them into hallow slaves or harrowing slavers. However, following Marilyn's willingness to accept one another, she knew it could be a beautiful experience that would bring everyone millennia of contentment.

Kiera, Marilyn, Kylie, Fey, and Addison would soon learn that for themselves.

[A/N: I'm glad everyone here has made it to a point where you can enjoy a harem with three-dimensional women with emotions and desires. It's just like every other harem, but it respects women and their feelings and showcases their willingness to accept and bond with one another. It's subtle and requires more work, but it's more rewarding to see these women emotionally and physically benefiting from the relationship instead of doing it purely for the MC's sake. Thanks for reading!]
