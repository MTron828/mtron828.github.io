349 The Virtues of Evalyn's Training

Nestled within the verdant embrace of Twin Rocks Wildlife Reserve lay a pristine lake, the centerpiece of this once tranquil haven for hikers and casual tourists. However, as the group neared the charred and broken remnants of the highway, they knew things were different.

"I didn't realize how eerily silent it was these days until I heard animals again," Fey observed, leading the group alongside Kaze.

"I'm not sure if it brings me comfort or unease."

A sudden cacophony of thunderous squawks and the booming roars of massive creatures caused the entire party to fall silent.

"To this day, I share your uncertainty," Kaze chuckled.

"Kaze...." she swallowed. "This training seems... off. Will you really let them die?"

"Did you draw a different interpretation from my announcement?" he sassed.

Fey pursed her lips, reluctant to argue. The thought of allowing people to die needlessly was unsavory. She could only accept it because the Lainwright soldiers, the largest group among them, appeared at ease as if it were second nature.

"Better they face such risks when the stakes are low than running out of Qi during a battle," Kaze asserted, calm and solemn. "War is on the horizon, Fey. Unless you are prepared to take responsibility for their survival, withholding vital experience due to your moral objections is a selfish decision that puts their lives beneath your principles."

Fey's eyes widened at his words. "And what of your own partners?"

"I have taken responsibility for their survival," he smirked, watching Kiera fly around the sky playfully. "That's why I've trained them nightly, provided them with superior techniques and skills, and ensured they have ample resources. I have neither the time nor motivation to do so for everyone, so I'm building their strength in a controlled environment. It's as simple as that."

Fey struggled to reconcile her beliefs with his reasoning. As an adult from a more peaceful world, she found adapting to the new reality difficult, though not impossible. "I'll trust you..."Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

"In time, you'll become well-versed in this new world and stand proudly on your own," Kaze reassured her without a hint of condescension or arrogance. "For now, placing your trust in me is the wisest course of action. At the very least, it will keep you safe and provide you with someone to blame for certain actions and outcomes."

"Wait!" Fey protested, her eyes wide with surprise. "I've never blamed you for anything, and I'm nothing but grateful."

"It seems, then, that trusting me has served you well thus far," he grinned in petty triumph, eliciting a frustrated puff of air from Fey as she begrudgingly admitted defeat. "You win."

"Hoh?" Kaze mused. "You were much fiercer in the lecture hall when people talked back to you."

Fey glared daggers at him, and he raised his hands in surrender, gracing her with a charming smile. "It appears I've grown accustomed to your clemency and have taken it for granted," he teased. "I withdraw my statement, Lady Roybock."

"Fey!" she huffed, turning away in frustration as his playful taunts got the better of her.

esksk Outwardly, not much had changed in the forest. Pine needles blanketed the ground, colorful fungi adorned the forest floor, and various unmutated flora and fauna thrived in the area. However, the once serene oak, birch, and pine trees now cast an ominous shadow, highlighting the forest's baritone howls, chirps, and snaps, and the perfect health of every plant felt more ominous than miraculous.

The ominous feeling made the sky realm cultivators feel uncomfortable without Qi despite their strength, making it impossible to trust their lives to the decorative swords the Scavengers collected from pawnshops.

Anxiety clutched at their hearts as the emperor halted in a picnic area, allowing the soldiers to gather around. Once assembled, the emperor took to the sky to address them.

"Remember the rules," Kaze began. "If you choose to venture into the forest, hunt the beasts and return to the campsite with your quarry. The top ten teams will earn exceptional prizes, ranging from techniques to body constitutions and cleansing treasures. However, do not forget that this competition is voluntary and comes with inherent risks."

The teams swallowed hard, the icy grip of fear tightening around their lungs.

"With hundreds of teams delving into the forest, Kiera and I cannot assist everyone," he warned. "In matters involving death, it is best to assume that casualties are inevitable. This is a voluntary event, so do not complain about who we help - if any."

Dread washed over the Immortals, leaving them shivering and bewildering the Lainwright soldiers. It was clear that the Immortals' unyielding spirit differed from their own. Evalyn's training had instilled virtues in them, and it was beginning to show.

"Finally, you are not alone in this forest," Kaze announced, sending a shockwave through the crowd. "Survivors depend on this forest for sustenance. This forest is their territory, so if you encounter them, do not harm them like barbaric colonialists. If I hear anyone justify a killing by saying the survivor pointed a gun at them...."

The emperor smiled mockingly, reminding them of their recent [painball] game and eliciting a few chuckles. "Most will possess mortal techniques," he continued. "If you fall at their hands, it is due to your folly, and you will receive no sympathy from me."

Everyone gulped, feeling the weight of his piercing gaze.

"Now, go forth," Kaze encouraged, his smile returning. "Stay sharp and prove to me that you are the alpha in this world!" His words invigorated the soldiers and Immortals, reminding them of their strength and status. Their earlier concerns now seemed trivial.

Following a strategic discussion, the groups dispersed along hiking trails and uncharted paths, each determined to return with impressive spoils.

"What if we cull the herds too much?" Fey inquired, concerned about the people relying on the forest for food.

"This forest is a trap," Kaze replied, his brow furrowing. "In a week's time, the treasure will draw the majority of the Sky Plane beasts here. Few creatures will survive. It's best to consume the wildlife and save low-risk survivors before they meet their end."

"How are they moving so fast...? Their cultivation is still unrefined," Caleb complained, chasing after Denzel and Chen. His plan to race ahead and secure weaker prey before others could eliminate it had backfired, leaving them struggling to catch up.

"It's the cleansing...." Luis whispered. "I heard it's made a significant impact on the others as well."

Madeline and the athlete clenched their teeth ‚Äî they'd heard the same thing but couldn't accept that soldiers who had just entered the sky realm a mere couple of weeks ago could become stronger "without proper practice or effort." Moreover, they felt Eric's team's unanimous victory was politically motivated, as they were prominent Lainwright soldiers.

The Lainwright soldiers tried to maintain composure, aware of the team trailing behind them. They would have offered to slow down to avoid animosity, but instead, they focused on strategizing‚Äî

"Stop!" Denzel commanded, causing the other Lainwright soldiers to halt.

Caleb lost his balance, veering to the side to prevent himself from colliding with the group. "Don't stop like that, are you‚Äî" He cut himself off as he looked forward.

CRAaaaCK!

While Luis also managed to stop in time, Madeline stumbled, trying to evade the group but instead crashed into a tree, propelling her to the ground. She quickly got up and spun around, her face flushed.

"Who the hell do you think you are, ordering us around!?" she chided. "Did you see what you just did?"

"M-Madeline...." Luis stammered, panic creeping through him.

"Shut up, Luis!" she snapped. "You didn't just slam into a damn tree!"

"Move!" Chen shouted, unsheathing his sword and imbuing it with battle aura.

"You need to shut up!" she retorted. "I'm sick of you‚Äî"

Before she could finish, Chen dashed toward her at a speed she couldn't fathom, proving they had been holding back. As she panicked, she grabbed the blonde by the hair and yanked back, making her shriek in pain as she flew to the ground.

Trembling with fear and tears streaming down her face, Madeline looked at Caleb and Luis. "What are you doing!?" she shrieked, pointing back. "He just hit me!" However, they were shaking as well.

GrrRRrrRrrer....

An icy chill crawled down her spine when she heard a deep growl behind her. It was booming and unnatural, like a true monster. She turned around with the fluidity of a rusty cog and saw Chen pushing back against a wolf, its teeth clamped on his arm.

The creature was enormous, the size of an elk, with a crocodile-like jaw. Its teeth sunk into Chen's arm while his sword penetrated the wolf's temporomandibular joint, causing its jaw to hang limp on one side, highlighted by a three-foot blade protruding from its back left cheek.

"Damn, this hurts," Chen grunted, flexing his arm, pushing its teeth from his arm. As a sky realm cultivator, the bite couldn't break past the muscle, but each tooth felt like a 50-caliber bullet.

GRrrrrrrRRrrrrrR!

Madeline's eyes widened in horror as Chen gripped the beast's jaw with his free hand and began to pry it open, forcing the wolf to resist.

"I've got it secured," Chen announced, seemingly out of the blue.

"WAH!" In a silver blur, a sword slashed down on the wolf's neck, releasing a torrent of blood that drenched the terrified blonde.

"I-Is-Is it over?" Madeline stuttered, tears mingling with the blood that cascaded over her like a waterfall.

Grrr Ghat! GHAT! Ghat! GrrRRrrRrrr GHAT!

As if in response, the rest of the pack leaped from a rock face, charging at 40 miles an hour. It was far from over.

While the Immortals shut down without a leader, the Lainwright soldiers were calm and collected, already communicating as the pack closed in. It was clear that Evalyn's training had powerful virtues that had yet to come to light.
