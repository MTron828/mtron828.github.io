"Two hundred pounds of salt to spare?" Kaze smiled, eyebrows raised in amusement, "I'm sure your people hate you after producing such an impressive quantity."

Evalyn frowned at his cheeky reply, dropping the sacks of sea salt on the ground. "Fine, go without salt."

"Come now, darling." He countered charmingly, "Surely you can see past the obvious and see my implicit compliment."

"Come now, [darling]." She smiled sarcastically, "Surly, you can compliment me without pointing out negatives."

"While it may take a century, there will be a time when you accept that I find no negatives in my words." Kaze replied magnetically, "I find beauty in the things you do."

"W-Wait up." Evalyn reddened in embarrassed bafflement, "You genuinely like my approach?"

The blonde had spent the whole night thinking about Kaze but didn't think that he would be in a charming mood when he talked to her. On the contrary, she expected a lecture on her brute force tactics, so she was genuinely flustered.

"It's effective, well-intentioned, and creative." He smiled gently.

"I don't know what you're talking about...." Evalyn blushed furiously, averting her gaze in a panic, "Half my people are traumatized, most hate me, and I don't have a concrete strategy--I'm just putting out fires."

"But you're succeeding." Kaze smiled in amusement, walking up, "Time and experience can give people consistency, but it will never bring results or success.

Unrefined as it is, you're showcasing your talent for leadership. It's far more valuable than the wins of leaders like Brigadier General Michaels. I find it breathtaking."

The ex-Maltian general got promoted to brigadier general when the Immortal Army formed that week. Now, he was third in command for military efforts, below Kaze and Evalyn.

Like Daniel, he had real experience with being a general. So he served as a mentor for Evalyn and was busy organizing the Immortal Army.

"I still don't see what you see in me." Evalyn whispered, looking him in the eyes.

"One day, I'll find a way to show you." Kaze said gently, embracing her cheek softly and kissing her.

After a passionate kiss, she whispered to him. "Kaze, please help me escape this life for a while."

"Can you leave?" He asked.

"I told people to die and keep dying if they needed me before 10 am." Evalyn blushed embarrassedly, "I was hoping you had some time."

It was six am the following day, so her reply was a confession that she was hoping that he'd want to have sex.

"I always have time for you." Kaze whispered charmingly, "And I will help you disappear."

He reached his hands under her arms and grabbed her bubble butt, picking her up.

The blonde wrapped her legs around his waist and gripped his neck, preparing him to thrust her against the wall.

However, they didn't hit the wall when he thrust forward like she was expecting.

"Eeeek!" Evalyn squeaked, flying through the tent's wall, fearing that people would see them. However, she crashed onto something soft instead.

She looked at a familiar ceiling before looking at her hand wrapped over Kaze's neck. A silver diamond ring radiated a golden light, making her eyes widen. "When did I...."

"You haven't used it yet, so I thought I'd remind you." Kaze replied charmingly, looking around, "Welcome home."N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

Like Kiera, Kaze gave Evalyn a spatial ring that led into their room. They were extremely taxing to make with an allowance of over a hundred miles, but he'd rather go without treasures than not give her a way to escape danger--even if she wouldn't use it.

So he invested half of his Soul Qi to create Evalyn and Kiera's rings and loaded both with one emergency usage. He created another two for Kylie and Marilyn, albeit with a range of fifty miles, allowing them to travel to Meridian City and get back, as they didn't leave often.

Thankfully, he maxed out the Soul Qi his Soul Core could hold safely after killing the fish. So he got it back quickly.

"I love you, Kaze." Evalyn said, her eyes trembling, "I'll get used to it one day."

"And I'll be waiting patiently." Kaze smiled charmingly, "No matter how many centuries or millennia it takes."

The blonde felt tears welling into her eyes, so she grabbed his head and pulled his lips into hers to prevent him from seeing.

√¢‚Ä¢ÔøΩ√¢"‚Ç¨√¢"ÀÜ√¢"‚Ç¨√¢‚Ä¢ÔøΩ

Evalyn swiveled her hips, walking to her pink-striped panties on the floor. When she got there, she bent down completely to pick them up, allowing Kaze to see her perfectly shaven pussy and ass in one view. "Can you take me back?"

"When you ask me like this, it's impossible to deny you anything." Kaze replied charmingly, watching her slip her feet into the panties and slowly pull them over her bubble butt.

He sat on the edge of the bed with a satisfied expression after two hours of non-stop dual cultivation with his lover.

The blonde twirled around embarrassedly, wearing a light blush. "Wait, please don't misinterpret my motions. I wasn't...."

"This siren act could break apart an empire." He smiled amusedly, watching her coquettish act, "It's inexplicably charming."

"Is that so?" Evalyn grinned, picking up her striped bra unabashedly, sliding on the shoulder straps individually, and buckling it, "I didn't think you'd get lured in by such acts after all your years."

As she spoke, she slid her feet into the black thigh-length green military shorts she wore and slid them up her tone legs. Then she pulled them against the bottom of her butt, wiggling back and forth to help them up.

It was a ruse, but it was very sexually arousing.

Kaze got hard and fell to his back, hands behind his head, enjoying the show shamelessly. He didn't hide his large, hard cock, flying in the open. "When an act like this comes from a woman like you, it tastes like forbidden fruit."

Evalyn turned to the bed after throwing on her black tank top, and her body heated up after seeing his hard, ten-inch cock on proud display. It revitalized her lust and desire, resurrecting it after hours of nonstop pleasure. "A woman like me? One known for being cold and unforgiving?"

"One in the same." He smiled charmingly.

The Ice General put her finger on her lips and walked to the bed between his legs.

"Are you saying it's a turn-on when I'm passionate?" She asked, bending her body and grabbing the base of his shaft, "And [giving]?"

Kaze took a sharp breath when she blushed seductively, opening her mouth, wrapping it around his head, and sucking. "Yes."

He hummed as she lowered her head, passionately rolling her tongue around his shaft, showcasing the immense skill she had picked up while dual cultivating [Spiritual Connection] with him.

Evalyn took a sharp breath, her rosy cheeks flushed pink. The pleasure she got pleasing him made her feel erotic and perverse. However, she didn't deny it, pulling his cock out of her mouth and rolling her tongue against his tip.

She closed her eyes and established a Spiritual Connection, connecting their souls and demonstrating her seriousness.

After analyzing his pleasure channels, she used a sub-technique to pulse Yin Qi through her tongue, following intricate patterns while using a sensory technique to slow time.

Kaze closed his eyes and smiled in unbridled pleasure, thinking about what she was doing. Her goal was to overwhelm him with pleasure, combining Spirit Qi, dual cultivation, and skill to get him off.

Since she was clothed and uncommitted, she tried to bewitch him with her overpowered sexiness and sex appeal--and it was working.

The emperor was attracted to a woman's personality more than their body or skill. So seeing the Ice General acting like a college-aged enchantress was extremely appealing, and he wanted to reward her. So he relaxed his body and let himself slide into simple ecstasy, accepting his selfish pleasure as her reward.

As a result, within a minute, he took a deep breath. "I'm going to come."

Evalyn nodded, sucking passionately at the same tempo. When she felt his throbbing cock twitching, she held her breath. A geyser of hot liquid shot into her mouth, and she used her hand to pull more out, sucking his tip.

After making eye contact with him, she swallowed effortlessly, unbending into a stand and wiping her mouth. "Well, get dressed then; we need to go."

From start to finish, she only sucked his dick from a standing bend for two minutes before walking into the bathroom to brush her teeth.

Her narrative was that she just decided to please him on a selfless whim, so she did so quickly. She had the power of a sex god to please her man, so she used it generously. Full control.

It was a charming, powerful statement that made the emperor smile--because of the irony.

"As you wish." Kaze smiled charmingly, standing up, "Though, I recommend you change as well."

Evalyn stopped brushing her teeth in horror. She looked down and saw that her green military shorts were soaking wet from her passionate session.

Her face immediately heated up like a thermometer, looking at the scene with a twitching cheek.

SLAM!

"And people wonder what I love about this woman." Kaze chuckled after she slammed the bathroom door, picking up his boxers from the floor, "I suppose they'll never know."
