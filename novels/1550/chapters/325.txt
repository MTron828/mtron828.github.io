‚ÄîAugust 11th, 2032 | 3 Days Until Integration | 22 Days Remain‚Äî

A somber silence enveloped the conference room, the cabinet members' expressions marked by gravity. The normally bright ambient lighting seemed dim and subdued, casting shadows that deepened the lines on the older members' faces.

"Did they kill any of our people?" General Michaels inquired, his voice slicing through the tension.

"Thankfully not," Evalyn replied, shaking her head. "The Immortals only sustained major injuries; no civilians were harmed. However, fifty-six Lainwright soldiers perished, and animosity towards Sky Plane cultivators has skyrocketed because an unwounded cultivator attacked indiscriminately without discussion."

Upon learning the dire scenario, Kylie's eyes widened in terror. "Why would they do that?"

"The cultivators encountered Calvin," the blonde elaborated. "One of them approached him for an explanation. But Calvin couldn't divulge information about Immortal Skye, which the cultivator interpreted as brainwashing and retaliated by attacking the base."

"We'll die if we speak to Sky Plane cultivators‚Ä¶?" Harper muttered, her eyes unstable. The reality of the situation suddenly took hold.

"Incorrect," Kaze responded, his voice frigid and resolute. "You can converse with Sky Plane cultivators and reveal that you cannot speak, just not the reason."

"That's a relief," Roxy responded. "At least we can prevent further issues."

"Speak for yourself," Harper sneered, her disdain evident. "Those of us lacking your social skills will die or incite massacres."

The pressure in the atmosphere multiplied when the blonde bluntly brought the issue back into focus.

"Now that we've acknowledged the issue, we must address its implications," Kaze announced. "Four bases have fallen around us, enabling Killian to triangulate our location. Furthermore, Vincent Ramble has sent a messenger carrying operational details to an outer base. We are at risk of Killian dispatching a full force to intercept us, so we must obscure our position."

An abrupt torrent of uncertainty swallowed the cabinet members, leaving them suspended in a state of unease.

"So you need our help eliminating other bases, is that correct?" Roxy asked, a sardonic smile gracing her lips.

"Partially; we require individuals to infiltrate them and discern if they know anything," he clarified. "There are four bases within 600 miles away each; we cannot infiltrate them without aerial assistance."

"You can forget it," Harper snarled. "I ain't riskin' my life talkin' to people to help you lot."

"We'd have to ease restrictions on your soul pacts and trust you not to betray us," Evalyn clarified. "We're taking a risk as well."

The room erupted in chaos, with the Immortals voicing immediate concerns about lessening restrictions. During the heated exchange, a searing pain pierced Roxy's heart, causing her to slump onto the table, gasping for breath.

"Well, we have our proof," Sage stated smugly. "A glimmer of hope and these people can't suppress thoughts of betrayal during a leadership meeting."

Roxy felt the weight of lethal stares bearing down on her, but she remained silent, unable to find the words to explain her thoughts.

"She's not in the wrong, Sage," Evalyn interjected, surprising the brunette. "She's simply being loyal to her people and family. That's why they need a reason to join us."

"While I appreciate your sentiment, we're talking about my family," Roxy argued. "What reason could you give me to betray them?"

"There's no need to betray your family," General Skye smiled. "Your decision to join us should be motivated by the desire to protect them, just like Crux."

Harper's eyes widened, glancing at the Pantheran princess with a bewildered expression. "You're tellin' me this woman betrayed her family to protect her family? What kind of twisted logic is that?"

Kaze offered an enigmatic smile; his fingers pressed together as his index finger's ring emitted a bright golden glow. "Common sense."

Snap! Thud, thud, thud-thud-thud!

A wave of vertigo suddenly gripped the group, their equilibrium disrupted as the table and chairs plummeted through the floor, dropping five feet into open space before landing beneath a brilliant blue sky. The back wall had transformed into a vast marina dotted with dilapidated commercial fishing boats rendered useless before the apocalypse.

"What's going on!?" Harper panicked, her heart racing from the abrupt shift. "Is this an illusion?"

"No, no," Kaze chuckled. "This is a technique far surpassing your fabled sacred status. I'm here to give you a reason to join us and a demonstration for my naive apprentice."

A massive, orange Panamax-class bulk carrier ship dominated the scene, dwarfing the surrounding vessels. It was massive, 80 feet above the water and long enough to fit on two football fields.

Kaze strode toward the ship's bow facing the pier and gestured gracefully, forming an arrow.

WHOooOooSH! SPLASH! WHooOOSH! SPLASH! WHOooSh! SPLASH!

"No way! That's the technique!" Harper cried as a beachball-sized sphere materialized at the arrow's head, generating a cyclone.

"Divine Arrow," Jake gasped, realizing the emperor had called him his apprentice.

"Divine Arrow?" Roxy echoed, puzzled. "As in the sacred-grade technique Duke Ranker uses? It shouldn't be possible for a mortal to‚Äî"

WhooOoOOOooOOSH! SPLASH! SPLASH! WhoOOooOSH!

Hair whipped wildly around them, caught up in the ferocious wind.

"Don't insult Emperor Lexicon by comparing him to Duke Ranker," Crux snapped, shouting over the raging wind. "This technique is trivial to him!"

"Trivial!?" Harper yelled, staring in disbelief.

At the arrow's tip, the cyclone whirled like a drill bit, creating a black hole that drew in air, water, and debris, enlarging itself into a multi-colored vortex. The tumultuous waters heaved, and the colossal ship groaned under strain.

From a distance, Kaze grinned. "Less is more when communicating ideas." He had chosen a straightforward display of power rather than something more ostentatious, as this was something they could comprehend. "But there's no harm in a little embellishment."

With a thunderous boom, the emperor unleashed the arrow.

CREeeeEeAK! CRUuNnnnNNnnNNCH! BOOOOOOOOOOM!

A deafening chorus of sounds pierced the air as the arrow tore through the ship's bow, warping metal, and scattering debris. The arrow's path expanded the cyclone, transforming the initial tunnel-sized puncture into a catastrophic exit that caused the ship's final third to explode.

The destruction continued, slicing a path across the ocean and unleashing a massive cyclone that grew in size and power. The vibrant rainbows it produced vanished a mile out as the cyclone devoured the clouds 600 feet above, casting a somber gray over the waters.

CRAaaaaAAAAACK!

The sound barrier shattered, and a thunderous boom reverberated through the land. The arrow's 50-foot scar in the water abruptly deepened as if dragged down by gravity, briefly cleaving the ocean by 200 feet before the walls slammed shut, sending a tsunami-like wave surging through the area.

"What the fuck was that!?" Harper shouted, jumping up from the table. The ship before the emperor vanished, and remnants of other vessels floated on the water's surface.

Crux and Evalyn were equally stunned by the divine technique that had altered the environment for miles and temporarily split the sea, exposing the seabed near the pier. After all, he had access to sacred techniques and beyond!

Silence descended as Kaze approached the group, wearing a smug grin. "If you require a reason, surely raw power will suffice, yes?" he pondered. "This is a divine technique; it's relatively weak and significantly limited on the Mortal Plane."F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The majors gaped, speechless, as he took a seat.

"Now, let us resume our conversation," the emperor smiled, interlacing his fingers. "We're dedicating 40 years to gathering cultural and intellectual capital to bring to the Sky Plane‚Äînot to accumulate power. If conquest were our goal, we'd conquer the Sky Plane within 18 months."

Roxy glanced at the ocean, then locked eyes with him. "This‚Ä¶." she whispered in awe. "Who are you?"

"The future ruler of the Sky Plane‚Äîthat's destiny," the emperor proclaimed. "Even if Killian dispatches two divisions with his dukes and lords, Evalyn Skye and I shall still govern the Sky Plane. The only variable is the death toll; I seek to save more lives than my partners."

Harper's eyes quivered, gazing at Kaze and Evalyn in disbelief. Her eyes held a peculiar gleam, reflecting disbelief rather than shock. Something seemed off, as if her expectations were concrete but had abruptly changed, leaving her confused.

"Roxy Alexander Grace," Kaze said, disregarding the blonde. "Crux Pyron is here because I offer protection for her family and promise her prosperity in the Sky Plane following the ascension. In contrast, those who oppose me will meet death and despair. If you seek to safeguard your family, join Immortal Skye willingly; everyone will grasp your motives in due course."

"What are the specifics?" Roxy asked, swallowing hard, cold sweat dripping down her shoulder blades.
