"No, there's nothing you need to know," Roxy said decisively. "I'll be back soon. Feel free to set up scouts to watch me leave and re-enter."

"I trust your intentions are good," Jake replied calmly. "So there's no need for further security measures. We can escort you, or you can leave unattended."

Sage scoffed and turned away, visibly disgusted. However, Veronica studied her fellow pixie's every motion with a level gaze.

"If that's the case, I'd prefer to leave directly, as I can fly right from the door." Roxy said, trying to decipher the disparity between the three leaders' expressions.

"Then let me walk you out." Jake smiled, standing and walking with her to the door. Once they got outside, he bid her safe travels, making her roll her eyes.

"I am serious about having goodwill." She said earnestly, "I hope you know that."

"As I said, I trust your intentions, so there's no reason to convince me further." He smiled, "I look forward to your return. We're unhostile people unless attacked; therefore, I believe we can gain a lot by communicating."

The fashionable pixie nodded and gracefully flew into the air, crowning the wall to escape the strange barrier.

Jake mysteriously smiled as he watched her fly away. Then he turned around and walked back into the guest house, where soldiers ate and drank merrily. He didn't make it very far before he was stopped: "Yes, Sage?"

"Are you insane?" Sage seethed coldly, "That woman is incredible at hiding her intentions--she's a spy. Yet you gave her info on our battle strength, techniques, and resources and then let her report it to her superior when Kaze isn't here?"

"Do you think I just let those people into Immortal Skye without preparing for an attack?" He scoffed, visibly annoyed, "I may not be Emperor Lexicon, but I'm not a fool either.

I've charmed and scared the cultivators into non-aggression to avoid panic-based hostilities for today--that's all I needed to do. I assure you, Sage, Major Grace will not send an attack order."

--Five Minutes Before--

"Please work." Roxy said in a stressed-out voice as she exited the barrier. She immediately pulled the jade slip from her cleavage and tried it.

While it lit up fine, it didn't glow green--instead, it glowed white.Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

"N-No way...." Roxy whispered in denial, "White means... dead or destroyed. Don't tell me they've already started fighting!? My soldiers!"

Her heart nearly burst through her chest, making her gasp hazily for air. She immediately flew as fast as possible to the clouds. From her top vantage point, she turned to overlook Immortal Skye for the first time.

Roxy's eyes trembled in horror as she gazed at the campus from above. It was sparse and unpopulated when they arrived, but now over two thousand Immortals patrolled the campus. As claimed, they were all Sky Realm cultivators, with some far more talented than the ones she had seen.

Not only that, but they were also wearing military tactical gear with a persistent technique that left a Soul Qi sheen similar to a basic barrier. It was clear they had prepared for enemies to ambush them.

No, they expected it. Everyone was idle and scouting the air on high alert. It was almost as if they knew another force was preparing to attack them--and they were right.

In the distance, she saw Major Reed and her troops--still very much alive--flying low to the ground from the trees. The technique limited visibility and stealth, as there were no footsteps.

Unfortunately, it was a double-edged sword; just as the Immortals couldn't see them, they couldn't see the Immortals. They were flying directly into a death trap and had no idea what they were up against.

It only took one casualty for everything to trigger a meltdown, and the group was b-lining for Immortals on a guard tower. They would kill a group before seeing the main force; by then, it would already be too late.

"You think this woman won't attack us?" Sage scoffed, "That's naive and delusional, Jake.

They're soldiers sent to kill us. No matter what she or those soldiers think, their superiors will order them to kill us. And if she doesn't attack today, she'll relay the information you freely gave divulged to the military so they can send a force capable of matching us. So stop acting like she's leaving to negotiate a treaty for us."

"Enough, Sage," Jake ordered frigidly. "You're free to think you're right while everyone else ignores you if you like. However, you're my subordinate, and you'll follow my orders--without question--regardless of how you feel about them. If you continue this recalcitrant behavior, I'll reprimand you for insubordination and report it to Emperor Lexicon."

"Hah." Sage huffed in resentment. "Understood. Just remember this--"

Boooom...

A small explosion went off in the distance. It was a few miles out, so the soldiers didn't even hear it over their merry chatter and drinking. However, they could hear it near the door.

"It seems her 'non-attack' order went through." She sneered.

Jake was stunned when he heard the explosion. "Please say they didn't kill anyone."

"What did you expect?" Sage sneered mockingly.

Major Reed and her soldiers made it through the east side of the forest at ghostly speed, Guided Arrows ready. Immortals on a watch tower spotted them and readied arrows in response.

"Stop!" Roxy screamed in horror, hitting breakneck speed toward the earth, "No! No-no-no- No-NO! Don't attack them!"

Screaming was futile; she was too high up, and the people moved too fast. Her troops would kill the scouts any second, and the two-thousand-strong force would spring into action to kill them.

It was over.

WhooOOooOooSH!

BOOOOOOM!

Contrary to expectations, Major Reed and her soldiers' arrows didn't hit the Immortals--they hit the tower. Even more bewildering, it took damage but still stood afterward. That wasn't just unbelievable--it was a serious problem.

The team flew past the tower at high speed, expecting it to crumble. However, since it stood, the people on the top had arrows and could shoot from behind. Therefore, their non-violent approach failed spectacularly.

Two Heaven Realm cultivators turned mid-flight with arrows aimed at the tower, meeting the gaze of the two Immortals within. Time slowed to a crawl as they decided whether to shoot.

Roxy knew the choice was in her soldiers' hands. Even a low-end Heaven Realm cultivator was vastly more powerful than a peak Sky Realm cultivator. So while her troops would get butchered if they ran into two thousand Guided Arrows, there was no contest in an even fight.

WhoOOooOooSH! BOOM, Boom!

"I'm not worried that Major Grace's soldiers killed Immortals, Sage." Jake said chillingly, "I'm worried the Immortals killed her troops."

Sage couldn't believe her ears. However, the gravity in his gaze meant that he was serious.
