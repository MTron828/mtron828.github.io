Evalyn gazed at her caregivers, her face a mixture of surprise and disbelief; the fearless leader everyone had come to know was nowhere to be found. Anxiety surged through her, uncertain about how others would perceive her now. She was, after all, a ruthless woman responsible for countless deaths.

Would they still accept her?

A woman with auburn hair, dressed in a solid green blouse, stood before her, brown eyes filled with tears and trembling as she stared at the apprehensive blonde. "Oh, sweetheart," she sobbed, embracing her tightly. "You don't have to justify anything to me; I'll always love you."

Tears streamed down Evalyn's cheeks as she hugged the woman with overwhelming gratitude.

"Is that what you were worried about?" a man with a neatly trimmed, graying beard and a gentle expression inquired. "All we've heard is how many lives you've saved--even our own. Liz and I are proud of your accomplishments and joy that you're alive, regardless of the means it took."

A woman around fifty with blonde hair stood beside him, nodding in agreement with a radiant smile.

"Hey, hey!" a five-year-old boy exclaimed, tugging on her black military pants. "Hey, Evalyn, we heard you're strong! Is that true?"

Evalyn was unsure whether to laugh or cry as three children between the ages of four and ten expressed excitement about her murderous power. She focused her mind and opened her palm to the boy, creating a stunning display.

"WOAH!" they shouted, marveling at the water drawn from the atmosphere, which solidified into a mythical bird resembling a parrot with the head and beak of an eagle. The crystal-like phoenix captivated everyone, though, to Evalyn, the intricate detail felt so natural that she couldn't comprehend its eeriness.

Ice General Skye handed the sculpture to the boy, smiling. "I'm strong, yes," she admitted. "But I'm not sure if I'm strong enough. That's why you must also become strong to protect your mother someday, Dylan. Can you do that for me?"

The brown-haired boy, missing a front tooth, beamed. "Of course!"

"I'm going to get strong too!" a girl in a flower-patterned sundress announced, hands on her hips.

"No, you're not, Mia! You're a girl!" Dylan retorted, protectively hiding the phoenix from the other children.

"Evalyn's a girl, and she's in charge here!" Mia huffed, pointing at the blonde with determination.

Laughter and tears filled Evalyn's eyes as she picked up the little girl, hugging her tightly despite the child's initial resistance. Soon enough, Mia giggled and hugged her back.

"Hello, Evalyn," a vibrant, red-haired woman in her seventies greeted her with a gentle smile.

"Ms. Collins," Evalyn choked, recognizing the woman. "You're...."

"Call me Scarlet now, child," the woman grinned. "I'm not sick anymore, and according to Mr. Lexicon, we'll never get sick again. It'll be awkward when we're both old hags, and you're still calling me 'Ms.'"

"You haven't lost that stubborn sass, I see," Evalyn laughed, wiping away her tears as she set Mia down. "Come here."

The two embraced tightly, their love for one another evident. Evalyn then welcomed the rest of the group: three women, a man, a teenage boy, and two young children. They focused on the present, not mentioning those who were absent.

Families and friends embraced one another as reunions took place, tears of joy and sorrow mingling. Jake hugged his parents and siblings; Veronica and Rein shared a bittersweet reunion with their fathers; Larkin regaled his little brother and mother with stories as she rolled her eyes; and Brad experienced an emotional reunion with his parents. Almost everyone had at least one family member present, with their tears reflecting joy for the reunions and pain for those who didn't make it.

One reunion, in particular, cut through the cries and heavy tension.

"REMY, EMMA!" Kylie shouted, tears streaming down her face as she embraced her two younger sisters, aged nine and eleven. Both clung to her tightly, sobbing uncontrollably.

Benjamin, their wavy-haired father, watched with teary eyes as his wife, Grace, broke down in his arms, overcome with emotion. It was evident that this tight-knit family reunion was incredibly passionate.

Kaze observed as the cabinet members reconnected with their families, who were now a top priority after the events involving Evalyn's mother. He resolved to prioritize family, and as he saw his comrades weeping in the arms of their loved ones, he knew he had made the right choice.

After a heartfelt moment, Evalyn stepped away from her caregivers and approached the emperor. "Are you ready?" she asked, glancing at the soldiers.

"Of course," Kaze replied with a smile, gesturing towards the sea of soldiers who immediately began moving. "After you."

General Skye rolled her eyes, attempting to keep her emotions in check. She longed to embrace the emperor but instead walked forward into the throng of Lainwright Military Base soldiers, eagerly awaiting the Immortals' arrival.

As the new motorcade and soldiers entered, many people were preoccupied with their families, hardly paying attention to the soldiers. However, Eric's team felt the intense resentment emanating from those who hadn't been as fortunate in their reunions. The bitterness and anguish were palpable, and Eric and Denzel prayed they wouldn't have to confront these individuals, fearing it could spark hostilities and jeopardize everyone.

The main campus of Lainwright Military Base featured a large town square at its center, capable of accommodating two thousand people, with thousands more able to fit into the surrounding roads.

A Roman-style stage with a roof stood at the heart of the square, with its back to a massive auditorium once used for troop graduation ceremonies.

To the east, the square was lined with cafeterias, administrative buildings, and public facilities for relaxation and personal training. To the west lay a series of modest barracks, offering small, individual rooms with a bed, desk, and dresser for each person. While lacking the luxury of the mansions they'd left behind, the soldiers were grateful for the privacy, given they'd been sharing rooms with up to ten people for the past two months.

Furthermore, the children had bunk rooms where their Immortal siblings could sleep to protect them and their parents. The campus was designed to accommodate more people after the confrontation, offering flexibility.

After unpacking their belongings, everyone reconvened at the town square, where the Lainwright soldiers gathered, eager to hear from the legendary emperor. As the Immortals arrived, they called out to their family members, anxious to lose them again.

The chaotic chatter and whispers suddenly ceased, replaced by an uneasy silence that drew everyone's attention to the podium, where Emperor Lexicon and General Skye now stood.

"Welcome, former Maltian civilians, special forces, soldiers, police, Sky Plane cultivators, and adversaries," the emperor began. "I address you this way to remind you that merely two months ago, you were all Maltians and half of you fought against our people. So before you judge, point fingers, or even speak to one another--remember that you, too, were once on the other side."

A tide of unease swept over them, threatening to erode their newfound pride unless they acknowledged their past biases.

"Being an Immortal is an honor granted to the virtuous elite who will lead us into a new era--not a birthright," Kaze asserted. "Many of you have earned this honor, while others are still on their journey. Are you ready for this challenge?"

"HELL YES!" Larkin shouted exuberantly. "We're the best in the world!"

The Immortals' enthusiastic cheers echoed throughout the area, soon joined by the clapping of the Lainwright soldiers.

"Remember, those around you are not your enemies," Kaze urged. "Don't lose focus by blaming those who have proven their worth for past atrocities. The true enemy approaches, and if we don't stand united and fight, we risk losing everything we hold dear."

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd, the gravity of the situation tightening its grip on their hearts.

"General Payton," the emperor continued, eliciting a surge of animosity from all but the cultivators. He scanned the crowd. "Do you see that?" he said with a vicious smile. "You don't need to search for an enemy, create one, or justify one--you know when someone is your enemy."

An explosive roar of anger and battle cries ripped through the area.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

"General Payton orchestrated bombings against our people and ordered the deaths of countless family members. If not for him, everyone here could have become an Immortal," Kaze announced, his voice cold and resolute. "He is an enemy."

The Lainwright soldiers, emboldened by this revelation, joined the chorus of contempt. They already knew their hardships stemmed from Payton's actions, but now they had a tangible target for their rage.

"Who would like to see this sick and twisted cretin eradicated from this world?" the emperor asked, callous and cold.

Immortals and Lainwright soldiers devolved into a frenzy when they saw they heard chains rattling atop the rooftop behind Kaze. No one felt pity when they saw the wretched man, thin as a toothpick and wrapped in chains. They were thrilled to watch the man die, and the more gruesome the method, the better.
