Chapter 356 Nightmares

Evalyn awoke to the sound of pounding on her door. No, it was more than that - it was an assault. The force of the blows caused the door to burst open, sending debris flying. The blonde leaped to her feet, conjuring ice blades from above.

"I going to need you put those toys away," Kiera said, her eyes blazing with bloodlust. "If you don't, I'll sever your arms, leaving you unable even to touch yourself."

Evalyn's eyes flared with anger, but a wave of surreal Qi washed over her, causing searing pain as she held her ice blades aloft. "What do you want, Kiera?"

"What do I want?" Kiera sneered. "I WANT KAZEY BACK!"

A maelstrom of surreal, negative emotions swirled in Evalyn's heart as she processed the cryptic riddler's words. "What… did you say?"

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'WHAT DID I JUST SAY?'" Kiera screamed, raising her hand to strike Evalyn but stopping as she noticed Kaze's bed - their bed - in the way. "KAZEY NEEDED YOU! AND YOU WEREN'T THERE. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN!?"

"W-Wait… don't tell me…." Evalyn whispered, the weight of the world crashing down on her shoulders.

"Yeah, he's dead! GONE!" the pink-haired teen declared. "FUCKING GONE!"

"H-How?" Evalyn asked, confused and disoriented. "Kaze is so—"

"You don't even understand your own tragic backstory, do you?" Kiera taunted, her contempt palpable. "Here's a hint: strong people die protecting the ones they love who are weaker. And I'm not saying you're weak, but I'd probably have lesser odds fighting a group of fourth graders."

***

Evalyn stood over Kaze's funeral pyre, her gaze distant and unfocused. She wanted to feel sorrow, but it was an emotion she had never experienced. As she stood there, staring at his body, she struggled to process her grief.

But she did feel something - guilt. It was her first taste of it, transforming her endless joy and suppressed emotional turmoil, boiling and festering until it burst. Now, all she felt was hatred - for herself, her actions, and those who took her lover from her.

Fire.

As Evalyn watched Kaze's body catch flames, she couldn't comprehend why it was associated with obsession and fury. Fire immortalized people and burnt their troubles away.

Ice.

Ice preserved enemies forever. It allowed their loved ones to see their bodies in full detail, encased in glass. They could gaze upon the twisted expressions of bloodlust they wore when they died – the repulsive ecstasy and sadism of battle.

No one could grant that person a hero's death. It would sear the truth into their minds for years, decades, centuries, or even millennia after their demise. It would be eternal.

That's what she would do.

Encase the entire Sky Plane in ice.

"There's still one cell left," Evalyn announced before a crowd of thousands at the funeral. "Tonight, we're going to eradicate them."

A commotion erupted immediately.

"Who the are you to order us around?"

"You didn't even fight! Why are you here now?"

"You're not our leader. Leave it to one of the women who cared."

"Why am I in charge?" Evalyn asked, her mind flashing with memories and hatred simultaneously. "I shouldn't need to say that."

A massive lance materialized before the man's eyes and impaled him trough his skull, drenching those behind him in blood.

"LISTEN UP!" she roared, seizing the lance and kicking the man's body, sending it flying into a group of people. "I'm not skilled in politics like Kaze was, so I'll make this simple: I'm the leader because I'm the strongest! If you disagree, step forward and face your death!"

Many soldiers turned to Kiera, but she scoffed and passionately argued that they were just as responsible for Kaze's death as Evalyn was. So, she would stand by the one seeking revenge.

"Now that we have that settled," Evalyn mocked. "Lead everyone to the stronghold. If I see anyone leaving a cultivator alive, I'll kill them."

***

"I-I said we surrender!" a man in a toga pleaded, crawling backward across the broken city streets, brushing past the bodies of his fallen comrades, each impaled on frozen spears. Dozens of them.

"There is no surrender in war," Evalyn replied, her tone chilling as she advanced, the ground freezing around her feet with each step. "The moment you raise your hands against someone, you're at their mercy – and my mercy means your death."

"J-Just don't hurt my family," the cultivator stammered.

"No, I think I'll take them, too," she smirked. "You, your family, your friends, and your empire. That's the price of your actions today."

His eyes widened in horror and disbelief. "W-Wait—ack!" he choked as his head rolled off his shoulders, crashing to the ground.

"Your words are meaningless," Evalyn spat, turning to face the thousands behind her. They had just won but found no solace in their leader's presence. Instead, she strode through them, leaving a chilling fog in her wake.

"Evalyn, isn't this enough?" Marilyn implored, her eyes tremulous and confused. "We've already defeated their forces here. There's no need to kill the women and children."

"On the contrary, there's no greater need," Evalyn retorted, her words as cold as ice. "We must send a message to anyone who defies us: surrender or face the fate of this city. Fight against us, and we won't just kill you – we'll take your mothers, brothers, sisters, children, and parents. There will be no one left to rise against us."

The brunette bit her lip, pained by Evalyn's words. "Then you should do it," she said. "The soldiers are losing faith in you; if you make them do this, they'll never forgive you."

"Worthless," Evalyn sneered, disgust and contempt in her voice.

***

Evalyn emerged from the silent, ice-encased city after all sounds within had ceased. She looked at her troops, who avoided her gaze and chose to fly above them. "We're not here to be heroes!" she thundered. "These people killed 99% of Earth's population and hunted us, weak mortals, down. When they failed, they tried to kill us again and again, until we ended up here. If we don't stop them, they'll repeat this cycle until you and everyone you love is dead. I won't let that happen - not again! Once I claim the Sky Plane, you can live the life you desire; until then, I expect you to follow me!"

—

A panic attack seized Evalyn as she jolted upright in bed, her breaths ragged and shallow. "A-A nightmare?" she stammered, her chest heaving.

"Yes, love," Kaze replied gently. "It was the Nightmare of Wrath. You've learned how far anger can take you; now, you must learn the consequences."

As his body began to glow again, Evalyn's heart clenched in terror, but she could not voice her protest.

"Fracture," Kaze murmured, sending her spiraling into another realm.

—

"It's been twenty years; how long will you keep sleeping in this bed?" Evalyn chided, a strand of silky pink hair falling into her eyes.

"It's 4 am, can't you wait until 6 until you start your slumber plunder?" Kiera groaned, rolling over.

"Why don't you do this to the others, Kiera?" Evalyn challenged. "I wasn't good enough alone, so there's also Marilyn, Kylie, Addison, and Fey. I'm pretty sure they sleep in the same to this day, so why don't you join them instead of ruining your reputation by sleeping with the Ice Demon?"

Kiera rolled over to avoid her gaze. "It's because you're wifey one," she said. "You're his legacy. He came back to save you, and that's what he did…. Now, you're all of him that's really left. Kazey found us; he searched for you."

Evalyn opened and shut her mouth, feeling deep pain. However, she felt confidence pulsing back through her veins. "He did do that, didn't he?" she asked. "Well, if that's the case, I'll make sure to honor that legacy."

Surprised, Kiera opened her eyes and watched the blonde walk out the door.

***

"Despite the vastness of this world, we have conquered one-third of all the territories in half a century," Evalyn proclaimed, addressing a sea of 100,000. "That's a feat far out of the league of any cultivator before us."

Her speech was met with hesitant but powerful cheers. As the Ice Demon, Evalyn wielded strength and efficacy, slicing through obstacles and liberating people in her path.

"We wage these battles not for the sake of war itself," she continued, her voice booming. "We fight to honor Kaze Lexicon's memory and put an end to the relentless cycle of violence. Our purpose drives us – without it, we would all succumb to our inner demons. I refuse to let that happen."

The atmosphere shifted, becoming solemn and respectful. Their leader had come a long way since her infamous massacre broke her from her trance.

"Today, we will end this cycle!" Evalyn declared. "Andrew Killian has amassed a million troops in a last-ditch effort to crush us. But remember, each one of you is worth twenty of their soldiers, if not more!"

A tumultuous mix of zeal, pride, and fear surged through the crowd, erupting into battle cries, cheers, and quivering voices.

"Fear not!" she roared. "I, the Ice Demon, stand beside you – I will personally eliminate the majority of our enemies."

An explosive wave of cheering shook the earth, the air reverberating with excitement and determination. After all, if Evalyn excelled at one thing, it was the mass elimination of her enemies.

***

"Evalyn, they've disrupted our formation – it's a trap!" Marilyn shouted, bursting into the room. "They anticipated our tactics and are now ambushing us, dividing our forces!"

"Why would they attempt such a thing?" Evalyn questioned, her eyes wide with disbelief. "Everyone who has tried to ambush us has perished."

"But not against a force of this magnitude!" Marilyn insisted. "With multiple assaults, you won't be able to singlehandedly turn the tide of battle. We're left with our raw numbers pitted against their strength."

Evalyn's eyes trembled in shock. "So you're saying—"

"They know you're an egomaniac who can kill an army," Kiera said, entering the room. "So they used that against you, cuz… obvi."

"This isn't the time, Kiera," the blonde growled.

"Then when is?" the slang riddler asked. "We need to retreat. That's what we need to do."

"If we retreat, we shatter the illusion of our invincibility, potentially leading to our empire's collapse," Evalyn argued. "It's not that simple."

"So what, you'll let all of your slaughter peeps die before you take the throne?" Kiera sneered.

"It's not that simple!" the Ice Demon reiterated. "We can still win this battle. There's no need to abandon everything when we will still claim victory."

"Yeah, yeah," Kiera grumbled. "Well, gotta go, chief. I've got a date with death. Just make sure not to regret your decisions again, because you're known for going crazy af."

"Kiera!" Evalyn shouted. "Come back... KIERA!" But the enigmatic woman had already vanished.

***

Evalyn decimated one unit after another, ultimately taking Killian's life. But as she surveyed the battlefield, she saw the gruesome scene Kiera had warned her about. Her people, the soldiers she had fought alongside for fifty years, lay lifeless on the ground.

Rein. Steve. Larkin. Denzel. Eric. One after the other, she recognized the faces of her fallen comrades. The rage that once fueled her was gone, replaced by a hollow feeling deep within.

It left her dead inside.

—

Evalyn awoke, the pain inside her more intense than she had ever imagined. She glanced around, saw Kaze, and broke into tears – not in anger, but in love. "Before you send me to the next one…" she whispered. "Please hold me."

"As you wish," Kaze said, lying with her and holding her tight.

"I'm just so glad you're here," Evalyn murmured. "I'm so grateful you're alive. I'm beginning to understand."

"That's what matters most," he said, brushing hair from her eyes. "By the end of this journey, you'll know what you truly want in life. I promise. No matter the outcome, I'll be here for you."

Evalyn nodded, thankful to have Kaze in her life. She allowed herself to be swept away by the light and woke up in another world.

Her grief and fear of succumbing to wrath or pride were laid bare in the next dream. She built a supportive network and gained popularity through politics, bringing prosperity to those around her. However, her intense humility and rhetoric of self-sacrifice eventually led her to develop a deep-seated victim complex. This mindset dragged others into a well of despair alongside her, causing internal collapse.

Once freed from the cycle of victimization, she found that most of her people had died, her supporters were in disarray, and her empire was in ruins. Desperate for a solution, she sought the power to overcome challenges alone and ensure stability. It began positively, but her relentless quest for power led her to amass everything within her reach, even things she didn't need. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The reason was simple: power and possessions never left her. They never died, hated, resented, or feared her. And so, she collected and hoarded power until she became the very person she despised – Andrew Killian.

—

Evalyn awoke with a tormented expression and turned to her lover. "These Nightmares… their purpose is to show that all mindsets have positive traits, but ultimately lead to destruction when taken to the extreme. Therefore, all paths converge at the same destination."

"Correct," Kaze replied, taking a deep breath.

"Then what about the last two?" Evalyn inquired. "I know what the Nightmare of Envy will show me, but what about Sloth?"

Kaze offered a faint smile tinged with complex emotions. "The opposite."

Evalyn managed a wry smile, her eyes fixed on the bed. "Which do you think will be worse?"

"The Nightmare of Sloth," Kaze replied, confident and decisive.

"Why?" she asked.

"Now that you've endured what feels like a century of suffering, don't you long for the sensation of pleasure?" he mused.

Yes," Evalyn chuckled. "In retrospect, Lust was the best dream."

"I know that all too well," Kaze smiled, making her eyes widen. "Believe it or not, envy also has its charms. That's why you'll experience the alternative first, and everything will come full circle."

"Then start whenever," she replied.

He nodded, and a cool green light filled the room. "Fracture."

***

Evalyn awoke with the most anguished expression yet, her plea tearing at Kaze's heart. "Please, send me there," she begged, realizing it had been a dream. "Please, Kaze. Anywhere but here."

Kaze nodded solemnly as his body emitted a purple light.

When Evalyn woke next, she finally understood the meaning of all the dreams and what she had to do. While it was painful, she knew she had to face a painful challenge before it spiraled out of control – and prayed things would work out differently than she saw in her last two dreams.
