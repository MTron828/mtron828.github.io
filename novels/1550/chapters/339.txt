340 Evalyn vs. Harper

The reinforced battleground Evalyn and Harper stood on stretched out a hundred meters long and fifty meters wide, far surpassing the size of the others. Immortal Skye had designated the space for cultivator battles, pitting cabinet members against Skythenians. An additional barrier encircled the arena for added security.

Lush green grass carpeted the ground, a testament to its location on the Immortals' side of the obstacle course, still pristine and unblemished. However, that would soon change as two blondes, one wielding the power of fire and the other ice, prepared for their face-off.

Thunderous applause erupted from the dystopian junkyard bleachers, with ten thousand voices cheering for their icy general while the cultivators fervently supported their fiery major.

"Considering the cultivators' excitement, I'm surprised you're not shaking in your boots," Harper taunted with a grin. "Especially after witnessing those eerie power demonstrations."

Evalyn smirked, "lI can freeze a half-mile radius into solid ice. But that's not allowed here; be grateful."

"Everyone I fight can do large scale damage in the Sky Plane," Harper grinned.

"I'm alive because I know how to counter those attacks. Do you? Cuz I can blow up at least this much."

General Skye's expression turned solemn. She had faced Crux countless times but never managed to defeat her. The thought of cultivators going all-out unsettled her.

A sudden, shrill noise pierced the air, forcing everyone to cover their ears as a shockwave rippled through the outdoor area. The sound came from a microphone, bewildering the crowd.

The sound of a finger tapped on the microphone multiple times, each time forcing the audience to wince.

Fingers tapped the microphone repeatedly, causing the audience to wince each time.

"Um... hello? Can everyone hear me?" A cute woman's voice asked over the loudspeakers.

A mixture of anxiety and excitement surged through the crowd when they recognized the voice ‚Äî Kiera Snow.

"Damn, don't think we were supposed to use the emergency broadcast system," a male voice chuckled, eliciting cheers from the Immortals. They knew the voice belonged to Larkin Downs.

"It's the only one with a backup generator," Kiera cutely huffed, drawing laughter from the crowd.

"Oh look, they're fixing it!" Larkin exclaimed, making everyone cover their ears again. He was yelling into the most OP sound system imaginable. "Oh, shit, my bad."

A group of soldiers approached the watchtower where Kiera and Larkin sat.

Once they finished, Larkin tapped the microphone. "Ahem. Mic check ‚Äî one, two, one, two," he said, testing the microphone. "Seems like it's working ‚Äî suuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!"

The crowd roared with cheers, and the pink-haired teenager beside him rolled her eyes. "Damn, your standards are so low. If a 'sup' can get you riled, what are you going to do when justice blonde cryo humps the shit out of Betty Bezerk?"

Harper's eyes blazed with fury at the teenager's words and the thunderous laughter that followed. "Oh, hahahaHaHaHAHAHAHA!" she laughed. "Oh, now this'll be for all of you."

"Oh, yeah, ya'll clam up to weak talk like a neo-nazi touching a bear who called them 'cupcake," Kiera rolled her eyes. "You're okay with it until someone catches you."

The crowd offered a chorus of laughter and cheers, making all the cultivators heat up.

"But here's the score," she continued. "You're like O to 80 on the KD ratio. So until you win for once, we're gonna treat ya'll like anti-climatic movie villains."

The Immortals roared with laughter, stoking the flames of Harper's rage.

"I believe Kiera's point is that if you posed a real threat to Immortal Skye, we wouldn't have been instructed to rile you up," Larkin grinned.

"Are you for cereal right now?" Kiera jeered. "You had one job, Larkin. ONE! It's the only thing you're good at. It's like Kazey gave you a whisk and a bowl of eggs, and you poured them down a toaster trying to be helpful."

"Nah, you got it wrong, princess!" he exclaimed. "Emperor Scrawn had so little faith in her that he had us twist her panties to unleash her rage and give're a chance. I'm pretty sure that's humiliating as a mother‚Äî"

"ENOUGH!" Harper roared. "Start the fuckin' match before I start roasting people!"

"Oh, that was my job, wasn't it?" Kiera asked, pointing to her chest. "Awkward. So, hmmm... yeah. Sorry blondez, let me make it up to you. Three... fuck it, just go for it."

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!

Without hesitation, the entire battlefield, spanning 5,000 square meters, erupted in a blazing inferno that licked the invisible barrier.

"Damn, girl! Did you grow up in Neverland?" Kiera inquired, peering through the smoke with her God's Eyes. "Cuz people outgrow temper tantrums, but you've elevated them to an art form!"

The spectators stood in shock, their eyes fixed on the impenetrable cloud of black smoke. Since they couldn't see, they didn't even react to the teen's words.

"Quick Q," Kiera continued. "What's it like to become a certified tantrum master only to find they STILL don't get you anywhere?"

BOOOM! BOOM! Boom, boom, BOOM!

A barrage of colossal explosions answered her taunt, frustrating those eager to glimpse the action. All they could see were the explosions and swirling smoke.

"Only that bad, huh?" the slang riddler taunted. "l thought you'd at least unleash ten."

BOOOOOM!

"Now THAT is what I'm talkin' about!" Kiera exclaimed. "Teach those ice clones a lesson!"

The crowd whispered in confusion, trying to understand her words.

"Ah, I forgot ya'll were blind, so I'll summarize. Ahem," Kiera coughed. "Tara Tantrum couldn't calm her tits, so she triggered a titanic-sized explosion, creating tons of smoke.

Major Blonze can see Qi, so it's usually not a problem. However, Evs keeps conjuring up ice statues of herself. They're incredibly detailed, too. It's the most narcissistic display I've ever seen!"

The crowd burst into laughter, spurred on by her animated storytelling.

BOOOM! BOOM! Boom, boom, BOOOOOOOOOOM!

"Yeah, waste'em!" Kiera cried, kicking her legs as more explosions went off.

"Waste all your Qi! Get it all out of your system! That way, her spankin‚Äô will go hard!"

"lI have no clue what's goin' on, but I know people don't keep attackin' if they're winning," Larkin exclaimed. "That means the Queen is in pitch black smoke, and she's STILL crushin' it!"

His excitement stirred the pot, adding to the slang riddler's assessment and boosting their spirits. However, most were anxious since they couldn't see.

Strangely, the smoke didn't disappear ‚Äî until they saw it reverse course, falling back to the ground.

"In case you're wondering, cold air is denser than smoke, so the chilled atmosphere traps the smoke and pulls it to the ground," Kiera explained.

"Harp's pretty pissed she's gettin' played with her smoke, but she stopped striking because Ev's been busy doing some shady shit."

As the smoke cleared, the audience could see the battlefield for the first time.

As Kiera mentioned, there were three hundred ice Evalyn statues dressed in that day's military attire.

Yet, the spectators' attention was drawn to the thousands of hovering blades in the sky and the scorched, motionless cultivator standing in the corner, breathing raggedly.

"Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention," Kiera smirked. "That last explosion blew up in Major Blonze's face! I'll keep the 'how' on the DL. It looks like the mystery's skull fucking the poor woman."

As Kiera described, Evalyn had erected a barrier the moment the match started, shielding herself from the firestorm. In the ensuing smoke, she conjured up numerous Qi statues resembling her appearance, which Harper's standard vision technique failed to differentiate.

In addition, Evalyn created thousands of ice blades in the sky to deter flight, prompting Harper to detonate them en masse. Amid the chaos, Evalyn launched a blade with solid oxygen attached in front of the blonde, and BOOOOM!

Evalyn had also attached solid oxygen to numerous statues and blades in the sky, effectively booby-trapping the entire battlefield. Harper was aware of this, so she strategized from the opposite corner while Evalyn replenished her Qi.

Though the general was winning, she needed to conserve her energy.

"l really despise you," Harper declared, clad in scorched tactical gear from Immortal Skye. "I can't pinpoint the reason, but something about you just screams 'hate.' However, I must thank you. You've provided me with a ton of bombs!"

Harper waved her hand, preparing to launch a wind attack to send the statues and blades toward Evalyn, intending to create a massive explosion. But just as she was about to execute her plan, she noticed something in Evalyn's eyes.

Or rather, what they lacked.

Mercy.

Evalyn's fingers were already pressed her finger when Harper felt dozens of blades from her blind spot crashing down upon her.

SNAP!

With a swift flick of her wrist, Evalyn's snap echoed, igniting an explosion.

Although Harper managed to dodge in time, the initial blast triggered a chain reaction with the surrounding oxygen crystalline, resulting in numerous massive explosions that engulfed them both in flames.Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))
