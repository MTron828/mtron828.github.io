Kiera caught the cultivator in her arms, making it before she hit the ground because the woman hit major branches on the way down. "Gah, I fucking hate this!"

She moved the woman to a stream, stripped the wheezing cultivator naked, and checked her pulse.

"I hate you." Kiera declared breathlessly, glaring at the woman, "I hate your people for what you did to Kazey five millennia ago. I would've ripped your throat out if he let me.

But he didn't--he needs you alive to keep the people he cares about safe, so I'll save your life.

Either way, I wouldn't let you die from a fucking orgasm. I'd leave you with enough dignity to watch me rip your throat out with dry clothing."

The slang riddler examined the woman's body with her teeth clenched. "Assuming I can save you.

You'll die in a few minutes after using that much Qi. You couldn't save yourself, even if you cultivated right now. That means...."

Kiera shut her eyes with a vicious expression, taking a deep breath and pouring Qi into her spatial ring, summoning a piece of chalk. "Listen up, Martha!Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com

You're about to die a gruesomely pathetic death, and there's [one] way to save you. I'm going to release more of that Elemental Qi in you like a fucking surgeon.

If you pull some shit like you did before and attack me--you're toast. If you talk about this to anyone--you're toast. If you accuse me of something nefarious--you're toast.

I hate this more than you do and lack all mercy. So unless you want to be a thick-ass slice of Texas toast, you'll grit your teeth and bare it!"

"W-What's that?" Jake asked with wide eyes.

Everyone stopped leaving the gates when they heard a moan so primal that they thought the woman was a dying animal!

They listened for a grisly five minutes, eyes wide as saucers, as the woman hit every piano key in eight octaves with her moaning. It was a rollercoaster of perplexion that sent them into a trance, and it wasn't until--

-

"AhhHHhhHhhHHhhHhhHHh~!" BOOOOOM! Boom! Boom, boom, BOOM! BOOM! "AHHHHhhHHhhh~!"

--Martha started releasing attacks en masse to release excess Qi that they broke out.

Sage smirked with predatory eyes, thinking she had obtained leverage.

"No one's to talk about this." Kylie ordered definitively, "Especially you, Sage.

I saw those eyes that said you got dirt on Kiera. But you don't--all of us know she's saving that woman's life in the most disagreeable way imaginable. For her, this must be torture.

So if you tell or mislead anyone, we'll vouch for Kiera, and Kaze will let her kill you."

"Why are you treating me like I've done something wrong?" Sage scoffed indignantly, "It's not like I'm trying to ruin your precious harem."

However, when she tried to see Veronica and Jake, she found the same murderous gaze.

It became clear that Kaze had successfully turned everyone against her, creating a net of restraints. Now, she couldn't dig up dirt on people as she usually did because no one would accept her words. He had cornered her in ways that she hadn't even realized.

"Understood." Sage swallowed nervously, "We're not talking about this again."

Martha woke up with a groan, rubbing her head in a haze. She couldn't remember what had happened. However, her eyes widened in shock when she looked down at her chest. "W-What the hell is this!?"

"That's called a hoodie; the things on your legs are called yoga pants." Kiera replied coldly, stoking the fire next to the woman, "Your toga's in the wash right now, so you'll have to make due."

The cultivator looked at the bright pink hoodie with wide eyes and the yoga pants. She couldn't figure out why the skin-tight pants were inexpressibly comfortable, but the loose hoodie was so oppressive. So she grabbed her breasts in confusion.

"And~that is a sports bra." Kiera explained bitterly, "It's so your fun bags don't slap your enemy in the face when you're flying around them.

In case you're wondering, it fits you--welcome to the joys of modern female fashion."

Martha took a deep breath and looked at the pink-haired teen stewing beside the fire with a grumpy expression. Memories of the last ten minutes she was conscious of flashed before her eyes, making her blush furiously.

That made the teen grit her teeth in severe anger, snapping the cultivator out of her haze. Seeing her bitterness, she thought back to the deathly Qi deprivation, which made her body cool down instantly.

"Did...." Martha gulped with shame-filled eyes, "You save my life?"

"No, I love giving my enemies orgasms as they shoot offensive techniques in random directions." Kiera scoffed, standing up bitterly, "You're awake, so my job's done here.

Be grateful and keep your damn mouth shut unless you want me to start my classes by making everyone use your intestines like a jump rope."

Martha's eyes widened in shock when an aquamarine ring on her right hand glowed, and she disappeared into thin air. "She... saved my life. Not just that...."

The cultivator stood and clenched her hands, moving her legs and testing her body. She had never felt so light and weightless before! Qi flowed through her body freely, making her feel liberated and free.

"This feeling...." Martha whispered before flushing bright red to the tip of her ears, "Gah, this is why that man told me to go to the Underground Bizarre!"

She jumped off the ground, trying to fly into outer space to hide her shame. However, her expression changed again.

"These clothes...." The Sky Plane cultivator whispered in shock, "They feel so free and comfortable when flying. Even this sports... bra... keeps my breasts like a unit of my body."

Martha sighed, looking over Immortal Skye. "Even with the hell I've been through, I can't help but wonder what would have happened if I was born here...."

She looked up and saw the rest of Earth in shambles and disorder as her actions. It made her feel a deep pang of pain in her heart that she had looked down on mortals and killed so many, only to regret it.

"I don't deserve to think like this." The cultivator whispered ruefully, "All I can do is move forward and... perhaps thank that woman somehow. She's rude as hell, but she's a good person."

Martha took a deep breath and flew back to her living quarters with a lonely demeanor.

"From what I hear, many people are unsatisfied with my training." Evalyn smirked ominously.

The Lainwright soldiers, standing before her at 5 am the next morning, shuddered. They knew by the increased security she set up that something was going to happen, and her sinister smile spoke volumes about what was to come.

"Well, from now on, you'll be in charge of your own cooking, eating, and sleeping." She smiled wickedly, "And you'll be doing it while training."

An icy chill crawled down the soldiers' spines as they looked from left to right, confirming the universal dread in their hearts.

"Let me tell you how training is going to work from now on." Evalyn smiled sinisterly, "I'm sure that you'll love it."
