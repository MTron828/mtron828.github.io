342 Treasures

Nestled to the northeast of the Central Mansion, the Immortals‚Äô training ground and firing range sprawled out, a daily hub of activity since the dawn of the apocalypse. Further north, beyond the imposing T-walls and chain-link fence, lay four expansive fields, a vibrant oasis of green on the mountainside. Football field-sized, they were adorned with mesmerizing purple flowers.

Although typically deserted, today, over a hundred people encircled a brunette woman, dressed in a white blouse and green shorts. Despite her gentle voice and warm, golden hazel eyes, she possessed an uncanny ability to command respect.

"Behold the ergo plant," Fey Roybock declared, caressing a green plant with grass-like leaves, seemingly braided by her delicate fingers. At its heart bloomed a purple flower, crowned with golden, hair-like styles. "Though akin to dandelions and thistle in its invasive nature, this plant holds the potential to transform our lives."

The Immortals gazed at the captivating plant, clearly alien to their world, their faces alight with curiosity.

"But why call it a weed if it's a treasure, too?" Larkin inquired, brows furrowed.

"If cake grew on trees, I'd welcome them anywhere."

Laughter rippled through the crowd, echoing his peculiar sentiment.

"A weed is merely a plant that grows where it's unwanted," Fey explained, chuckling. "lt doesn't mean the plant is inherently bad. You wouldn't want a cake tree sprouting in your house, even if you love cake."

"Objection~!" Kiera chimed. "l beg to disagree."

The area erupted in laughter, setting a jovial tone for the day ahead.

"People's preferences vary depending on their situation, location, and desires..."

Fey began, her voice trailing off as she blushed before snapping back to attention.

"What's behind that blush, teach?" Kiera taunted, eyes narrowing.

"More importantly!" the professor exclaimed. "Ergo is invasive and spreads incredibly fast! In under two months, we've cultivated four acres with 2,000 plants!"FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

As she pointed out, the four fields held approximately 500 plants each, meticulously arranged in ten rows of 50, creating a breathtaking sight.

"What makes them a treasure is their capabilities and potency!" Fey elaborated, her words quickening. "Ergo attracts impurities within your body like a magnet and absorbs them like a sponge. Then your body expels it, effectively cleansing your system."

The women cringed, exchanging apprehensive glances with their fellow Immortals.

"All plants, animals, and objects absorb refined Qi, or soul Qi, which possesses cleansing and strengthening properties," Fey continued. "The more soul Qi ergo absorbs, the stronger its purifying effects become. Once it reaches a level of significant impact, it is considered a treasure."

"I have a question..." Martha interjected, her expression bewildered as she stood beside Amy.

"Please, ask away," Fey encouraged, her composure restored.

"Ergo takes ten years to mature in war-torn areas of the Sky Plane, even with an abundance of soul Qi," the brunette cultivator prefaced. "So how are we standing before two thousand ergo plants that appear more potent than treasures matured for a century?"

A wave of astonishment swept through the crowd as Calvin and Amy nodded in agreement, both equally puzzled. Had the other cultivators been present, chaos could have ensued.

"Ummm..." Fey hesitated, seeking assistance.

"It seems there's a misconception about soul Qi in the Sky Plane," Kaze offered, stepping through a spatial rift behind her, causing Fey to jump and squeal. The crowd burst into laughter. "Are you okay?"

Fey's face flushed crimson as she fumbled for words, to no avail.

"Damn, the floozy's got awkward charm like a shy supermodel in a space club," Kiera grumbled, looking away. She was aware of Fey's place on the harem guest list but clung to hope she would meet a guilt-free, natural demise.

"You're asking two questions, and I'll address both," Kaze said, plucking an ergo plant with a chuckle. "First, why can plants that take decades, centuries, or even millennia exist? The answer is simple: plants directly absorb soul Qi."

Golden light emanated from the emperor's fingertips, infusing the plant with a neon hue as energy surged through it like veins. Energy coursed through the flower petals, unfurling and flexing them. They seemed to come alive, moving in a peculiar manner that suggested the plant was exuberant.

"The same principle applies to reinforcing objects," Kaze expounded. "lt may take millennia with the right materials, but I have personally enhanced them by infusing them with soul Qi."

"Yes, but [how] ‚Äî your manipulation of soul Qi is abnormal," Martha clarified.

"Spatial ring masters and armor specialists may have soul Qi techniques for specific purposes, but we just witnessed you imbue soul Qi into something like a water technique."

"Being confined to soul cultivation techniques in the Sky Realm naturally imposes limitations, no?" the emperor smirked. "It stands to reason that a divine technique would grant greater control over soul Qi and its applications."

Martha, Amy, and Calvin trembled, unable to accept his explanation. The techniques he referred to were two realms beyond the most advanced ones in the Sky Plane, so they struggled to believe him.

"Now that we've covered why these plants didn't require decades to mature, let's address your second question ‚Äî why are they of superior quality compared to high-end treasures?" Kaze asked, grinning. "It's because they've directly ingested highly refined soul Qi from a hundred one-ton soul beasts. The Sky Plane's warped power structure and the suppression of soul beasts requires millennia to refine even a weed like ergo to this level."

Martha's brow furrowed in contemplation. "Hold on, why do plants far beyond that quality exist in the Sky Plane? I've seen them, so it wouldn't make sense if it took that long."

"If there aren't enough beasts to nourish plants naturally, the only logical alternative is to use people, yes?" Kaze smiled, sending shivers crawling down the cultivator's spines. "In such a scenario, an emperor notorious for eliminating dissenters could amass enough strength to withstand a heaven realm technique, provided that everyone else remained weak. Restricting soul beasts curtails the availability of natural treasures and power-boosting resources, and would accomplish just that."

The cultivators were overcome with a mix of dread and horror as they grasped the implications of his revelation. In a single statement, he addressed three major enigmas: Killian's immense strength, the extraordinary vitality of his plants, and the strict regulation of soul beasts.

"Soul Qi accumulates and refines over time," the emperor's eyes narrowed.

"Thus, employing the bodies of formidable political adversaries would naturally yield the finest treasures. That is the fundamental nature of rudimentary treasure cultivation."

A heavy silence descended upon the area as everyone attempted to process his words, grappling with the unsettling reality he had exposed.

"Fortunately, that's not the case here," Kaze reassured them with a smile.

"Instead of resorting to such cruelty to cultivate these plants, I have extracted the soul Qi of animals far more powerful than most Sky Plane cultivators and nourished the plants with it. As a result, there are no human souls in these plants."

A wave of relief washed over everyone, lifting the atmosphere.

A collective sigh of relief rippled through the crowd, lightening the mood.

"Quick Q, no need to answer, but..." Kiera said, playfully rocking on her toes and heels. "Hypothetically ‚Äî and I stress hypothetically ‚Äî how many floozies would it take to create a treasure potent enough to ward off a future floozy infestation?"

"Seeing as you've stated I don't have to answer, I'll opt out," Kaze mocked, rolling his eyes. "Does that address your concerns, Martha?"

"Y-Yes," Martha responded, her voice shaky. Kaze's logical explanations had shaken the cultivators to their core, resolving numerous questions and controversies they wished had remained unspoken.

"Please proceed with your charming class, Fey," Kaze requested, flashing a charming smile that left her blushing from ear to ear.

"Y-Yes," she stammered, raising her plant. "Let me demonstrate how to harvest ergo. Since it's a flower, don't pluck it; instead, trim its leaves at the base and separate the flower at the head. This way, it will regrow in the same spot. Any questions?"

"That woman's soul Qi could probably create an migh~ty flashy ring," Kiera whispered with a smirk. "l wonder if Kazey would gift it to me for our anniver‚Äî I'm joking! If I weren't, I wouldn't be speaking like a mouse with tuberculosis!"

Those around Kiera turned to her, having heard her mutterings. They then glanced at the emperor, who was frowning at her with an expression that said, "I'll give you the world, but not the people.

The haunting part for Kiera was that his expression appeared utterly genuine, leaving her to wonder about Isebell. It was both revealing and terrifying.

"Alright, let's begin the harvest!" Fey clammed, drawing everyone's attention with a broad smile. "With this many people, it should only take a couple of hours. Afterward, we'll eat and begin processing the plants. The sooner we do, the sooner you'll all experience their wondrous benefits!"

Enthusiasm surged through the crowd like a jolt of electricity, supplanting the chilling sensation of apprehension that had arisen from Kaze's revelations about treasure cultivation. Eager to forget, they allowed the unease to dissipate, focusing on the day ahead and the promise of renewal.
