339 Unspoken Rivalries 12 Days Remain

Driven by Sage's incentives and Evalyn's compulsory orders, soldiers and Immortals constructed ten combat arenas using military T-walls, later reinforced by the emperor. Then they used their supernatural to create makeshift bleachers with T-walls, vehicles, wood, and other materials. The resulting structure was as impressive as it was precarious.

The stage was now set for thousands to engage in combat and showcase their prowess.

"Welcome to the sparring matches, where we will test our strength against one another," Kaze proclaimed with a smile, soaring above the crowd alongside Evalyn.

"General Skye and I have devised match-ups that pit your skills against evenly matched opponents," he continued. "Due to the training disparities, Lainwright soldiers will fight in pairs or groups against Immortals. Likewise, some Immortals will engage in group combat against cultivators."

A wave of excitement washed over the Lainwright soldiers, who had previously felt hopeless about victory. The knowledge that the Immortals would also face handicaps lifted their spirits.

"Let's discuss the rewards," Kaze grinned. "We will score all match-ups on a ten number ranking system. A score of seven earns a minor cleansing treasure;

eight, a major cleansing treasure; nine, a sky-realm body constitution; and ten, a prize l will reveal shortly."

Murmurs spread through the crowd as everyone tried to recall the value of the treasures.

"Cleansing treasures purge impurities from your body, enhancing your ability to absorb and release Qi and Qiites from your acupuncture points," Kaze explained. "Imagine a clogged drain as the conduit for your Qi; unclogging it will immediately result in an higher output. That's what this does. A minor cleansing treasure of this caliber can double your strength in an hour."

Astonishment swept through the group as they grasped the stakes.

"These treasures possess the potency to complete a full stage cleansing for a heaven realm cultivator, so encourage cultivators to take this seriously," Kaze added with a smirk.

The cultivators' shocked expressions told the Immortals everything they needed to know about the treasure's value.

The cultivators were more perplexed than impressed. Standard treasures took decades or centuries to mature, so it was theoretically impossible for them to exist on the Mortal Plane. However, Kaze did what all Heaven Plane botanical cultivators did ‚Äî he found a plant with the properties he wanted and fed it highly refined soul Qi using botanical techniques.

Using ultra-refined soul Qi and techniques on ergo was the equivalent of putting a NASCAR racer into a commuter vehicle and facing them off against amateurs with sports cars. In an obstacle course, potential doesn't equate to performance.

"Let's talk about body constitutions," Kaze announced. He explained the value of constitutions, including physical and elemental resistance, and making people beautiful. While they were excited, they temporarily lost enthusiasm after learning the blueprints healed in the pattern, requiring centuries or for them to break their bones. However, their enthusiasm returned when Kaze reminded them of their healing techniques.FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

"While healing techniques accelerate growth, but they pale before the grand prize," Kaze smiled. "Those who earn a ten will obtain a restructuring treasure potent enough to instantiate their sky realm body constitution ‚Äî instantly."

The cultivators were shocked into silence. Restructuring treasures required rare plants and liquids. Even if Kaze had a method for injecting Qi, he shouldn't have the plant!

"We will evaluate participants based on potential‚Äînot power," Kaze announced, continuing. "This means that the weakest could win the grand prize while the winner may leave empty-handed. After all, If someone half your strength nearly defeats you, your victory is insignificant. With equal training, they would vanquish you. That's what we're seeking."

The Immortals grew anxious, realizing their perceived advantage no longer held significance.

"However, those who earn a six can compete again," Kaze clarified. "Victory still matters, so winners will get another chance. Do not lose hope; regardless of your status, past affiliations, or current strenth, everyone can triumph this week!"

The crowd erupted with thunderous applause and fervent battle cries, dispelling the lingering bitterness and unease they had experienced earlier.

"Immortals, remember," Kaze began, capturing their attention, "you are not elite because you're an Immortal; you're an Immortal because you're elite. don't want to hear complaints if a soldier or cultivator obtains a technique, or vice versa. If you can't prevail in fair matches and potential-based scoring against non-elites, you don't deserve one!"

A ripple of anxiety coursed through the group, their confidence wavering for the first time. The emperor rolled his eyes and sought clarification. "Immortals, have you ever lost?"

"NOT ONCE!" Larkin roared. The crowd ignited with fervor, their cheers growing in intensity.

"Exactly!" Kaze bellowed. "Only three months ago, we had NOTHING. Yet we triumphed over Malta, Sky Plane cultivators, and the undead. Are you afraid of losing!?"

A chilling surge of bloodlust swept through the stands, causing the hairs on everyone's arms to bristle and their breaths to turn shallow.

Evalyn then understood why Kaze decided to keep the Immortals distanced from life-or-death scenarios. He cultivated an immortality complex that didn't see failure as possible, thus boosting morale and excitement to unimaginable levels. That's why they had higher morale when she arrived than her soldiers ‚Äî a telling insight.

The first match-up was an unexpected one, leaving everyone astonished.

"Soldiers!" Evalyn thundered, soaring above her troops. "Here at Immortal Skye, we lead by example. As such, I will challenge someone with over a century of cultivation and military expertise. But I won't stop until l achieve a ten; that way, you can witness my growth as I dominate her in just three months! This will be evidence of our system's effectiveness."

The raucous soldiers and Immortals erupted with enthusiasm and anticipation.

Since she had already shattered the notion of invincibility, she would now transform her strategy into an unstoppable force that would eventually surpass Kaze's. She embodied the system's success and would provide the required morale boost.

"Bold claims, Evalyn," Harper scoffed, narrowing her eyes. "You may have monstrous talent, but you're still a naive kitten. Do you think I'll let you showcase a five on the talent scale?"

"I don't," Evalyn replied with a grin. "For some reason, I sense that you'll battle me relentlessly, even if it means gouging my eyes out. So I'm going to take you down a notch."

Harper's eyes gleamed with lethal determination. "Oddly enough, I sense that too," she grinned, her pupils constricting. "So you better hope your boyfriend comes to your rescue, because this won't be a pretty sight."

A surge of anxiety rippled through the cultivators, who felt that the former major had thrown caution to the wind and insulted both leaders. Yet, Evalyn wore the same expression, sending shivers down the spines of the Immortals and soldiers. They had never witnessed their general display such personal fury before a battle; it was terrifying.

Kaze observed in silence, attempting to piece together the root of the animosity.

He had known Harper Reed from his early years in the Killian Military. But she had vanished without a trace; he hadn't heard about her since. It was unsettling.

Now faced with this situation, he tried to discern if it was genuine. Though Kaze possessed an almost infallible memory, it was useless if he lacked information about an event or had a different interpretation.

"He will save me, so don't hold back," Evalyn declared, a menacing smile gracing her lips. "So give it your all, because I won't stop until Kaze needs to heal you."
