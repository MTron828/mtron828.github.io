"I will be in closed cultivation for the next two days, three at most." Kaze explained to Jake as the latter dropped him off, "After which time I will begin fulfilling my obligations."

Before Jake could speak, Kaze shut the shuttle's door and walked into his home. He then got onto his phone and summoned memories of various apps and security features.

He pulled up Yanko, the largest platform that allowed anonymous posting, using a VPN.

"I won't ever move freely again if this isn't anonymous." Kaze chuckled bitterly.

Thirty seconds after he let out the post, dozens of comments began flooding in, claiming that [the scams are already popping up], [how creepy, how aren't you in jail?], and dozens of similar variations.

Most people were salty, and the few interested were immediately drowned out with hundreds of hate comments.

"As if a weak man would walk into a well-known man's home with fake techniques and sleep with his wife." Kaze scoffed, "I wonder how long it'll take these obtuse simpletons to realize that."

He had other things to worry about, so he sat in the lotus position on the floor.

"What path will bring me to you, Paragon of Immortality?" He asked with a profound expression.

Cultivation was a path. If Kaze started with the Golden God technique he had yesterday, his meridians would become vortexes, summoning all of the Qi in the Moral Plane to his body until he exploded.

Therefore, cultivators chose techniques unlocking others in a web of possibilities. A certain path would build his meridians and body constitution to handle the power of the Golden God technique.

While he knew that path, he wanted to learn the path to the Paragon of Immortality. The god of cultivation left behind the technique during the genesis period of cultivation hundreds of millions of years before he was born.

While Kaze became the strongest human cultivator in history, he never became a true god because his cultivation path didn't allow it. So he sought to rectify that.

"Paradigm of Divinity for elemental cultivation, Spiritual Connection for dual cultivation, and‚Ä¶."

Kaze stopped when he thought through the body techniques he could use. It was a hard choice because the enemies on the Moral Plane were weak and couldn't temper a high-level body well.

"It's fate to eventually end up on higher planes, so I'll do what's best... Onyx Definition. Soul cultivation techniques can wait until bodies begin stacking up. Let's get started with cultivation."

Kaze closed his eyes, summoned the blueprint for the Paradigm of Divinity technique in his mind, and then began cultivating it.

A white aura expanded from his body, warping the space around him playfully in a complex, distorting pattern.

Elemental Qi in the area mixed with his white aura, creating sharp, black contours that weaved through the warping space, moving in the opposite direction until it entered his meridians.

His body burned as his unused meridians and dantian expanded.

"Paradox of Healing." Kaze muttered while gripping his teeth.

A golden hue developed around his body. He skillfully used the new Qi from the influx to feed an ancient-grade healing technique, using only its most minor application.

It healed the meridians and dantian in intervals, allowing them to expand and rip apart, then heal stronger like muscles in a human's body.

During that period, he needed to channel the exact amount of Qi he received into the overpowered healing technique to prevent Qi deprivation.

If he failed, he'd pass out, and the Paradigm of Divinity would suck in Qi like a vortex without releasing it, leading to his dantian rupturing or death.

It was an intricate task he performed for 18 hours in excruciating pain, showcasing the skill that made him the emperor of the Immortal Plane.

When the meridians and dantian became strong enough, he used a technique to forcefully limit Qi intake and passed out on the floor.

Kaze didn't wake up for 23 hours. When he finally opened his eyes, he turned to his phone, which had a blinking light.

"Let's see what's happened thus far." He groaned.

The minute he saw the notifications, he almost shut off his phone. There were 11,823 notifications on Yanko and 27 text messages.

Kaze sighed and opened up his messages first.

Over twenty were from Jake, seeing if he was okay or wanted him to send a shuttle and asking about cultivation techniques. He also sent him a dozen messages with URL links.

The emperor ignored all of them and scrolled through messages from past acquaintances until he found a text from an unknown contact.

‚Äî

Unknown: This is Evalyn. I want to speak to you in person. Public location, playboy.

PS: If you tell anyone I have a divine body again, I'll find a suitable method to kill you.

‚Äî

Kaze chuckled when he read it. "Even after 317 years, you didn't change Eva‚Äî"

He shut his eyes mid-sentence and took a deep breath. The emperor's heart ached when thinking about the past.

Somehow he focused exclusively on the apocalypse‚Äîand power‚Äîas he always did, ignoring the intricacies of his feelings that he locked away millennia ago.

Kaze changed her name on his phone and hit the reply button.

[You: Okay. Do you like seafood?]ùí©ewW ùíèovels updùíÇtes on nov/ùíÜl/b(i)ùíè(.)com

He sent it with a slight smile, waiting for the impending hell to break loose. Thirty seconds later, his phone's notification light blinked green.

[Ice Pheonix: Are you a stalker?]

Kaze laughed and replied again.

[You: No. I can see the future, remember?]

The light blinked.

[Ice Pheonix: Hah. So, do you also see other people's futures?]

Kaze smiled.

[You: Of course not. I just know because we're having dinner at a seafood restaurant later.]

Ten seconds passed.

Then a minute.

Three minutes ticked away.

Five.

Ten.

Finally, the flickering light returned.

[Ice Pheonix: Elson's on 4th. 7 pm tomorrow. If you touch me, I'll watch your spine snap in half in slow motion. I can see why you're interested in my power, so be wary of it.]

Kaze laugh-scoffed in disbelief.

[You: Scary.]

The notifications stopped coming through, leaving a warm smile on his face.

"Let's weave through the ant nest." Kaze sighed while looking at the Yanko app with thousands of messages.

"Scam. Scam. Prove it. Interested, contact me, scam, scam." He chuckled while arrogantly posting again.

People who were already following jumped on the post, sending in hate comments at twice the rate before. After bitterly understanding the power of cultivation from those who got techniques, their comments became more vitriolic and extreme.

"Ah yes, where was I? Ah yes, Onyx Definition. I don't have body-tempering treasures, so I'll just have to make some." Kaze chuckled with hate-filled eyes.

"I supposed I'll pick up preparations on the way to my date."

Kaze stood up, unbuttoned his shirt and pants, and grabbed a towel on the way to the shower.

"In the meantime, I should start with cleansing." He laughed, "It will be unpleasant shredding my body inch by inch, but it will be worth it to see her face as her power play preparations crumble."
