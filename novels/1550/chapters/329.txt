‚ÄîAugust 14th, 2032 | Immortal Skye‚Äî

Before dawn on August 14th, 2032, almost four thousand individuals assembled at the southside entrance of Immortal Skye. Military vehicles brimming with supplies stood ready to transport them to the Lainwright Military Base, their exhaust pipes releasing steam plumes.

Darkness still enveloped the area, and the air was crisp, yet sleep eluded everyone present. Some struggled to contain their emotions, their veins coursing with hatred for the Lainwright soldiers. For others, anxiety pierced their hearts as they anticipated seeing their families once more.

A whirlwind of change had swept through their lives in the past two months, so they were no longer the same people. It left them with gnawing questions.

Would their loved ones still care for them after learning they had killed cultivators?

Could they find acceptance?

Would their families remain unchanged?

Countless questions weighed on the cultivators' minds, their emotions a complex blend as they prepared to depart for Lainwright Military Base.

Kaze rose to the forefront, his expression enigmatic, as he addressed his people, "In mere hours, many of you will be reunited with your families and introduced to those who will stand beside you, defending them. With the confirmed threat looming in just two weeks, we must set aside our emotions and concentrate on the task at hand."

Emotions rippled through the crowd, amplifying the tension in the air. The news of an imminent confrontation in a fortnight had only reached them the night before.

"Although Maltian soldiers have committed heinous acts against us, General Skye vouches for the ones you'll encounter," the emperor stated. "Each has defended your families not once, but twice ‚Äì some even three times. Many have sacrificed their lives to protect your loved ones before our arrival; will you scorn the very people who saved your families because of the evil deeds of others?"

"No..." the embittered soldiers muttered, avoiding eye contact.

"General Skye co-leads Immortal Skye," Kaze continued. "Do you doubt her judgment, her dedication to bringing the guilty to justice, and her commitment to training soldiers to safeguard your families?"

The resentful snapped to attention, their eyes quivering as they shook their heads.

"Do you trust your leader, the leader who personally set out to protect your families?" he inquired.

"YES!" the soldiers bellowed, both frantic and resolute.

"General Skye represents Immortal Skye‚Äîdo you question Immortal Skye?" Kaze's voice rang out, strong and earnest.

"NO!" came the unanimous reply.

"Exactly what I expected!" the emperor thundered, "Your General leads you, the finest among the elite! Will you let your emotions cloud your judgment? Or will you greet your leader with a triumphant welcome?"

"TRIUMPH!" they shouted, their voices resonating through the air.

"That's right, soldiers!" Kaze roared. "We will embrace her efforts wholeheartedly and follow her guidance as she steers us to victory!"

"Hurrah!" the ex-military members cried in unison.

"Remember our objectives!" the emperor commanded. "Your mission is to protect your families!"

"Hurrah!" The Immortals joined in.

"Train, grow stronger, and become the mightiest!" he bellowed.

"HURRAH!" everyone shouted, swept up in the infectious atmosphere.

"And when the Killian elites arrive‚Äîthe architects of this genocide, not those among you as scouts and mentors," Kaze's voice boomed, leaving people breathless, "We will stand united with our general, our newfound allies, and our recent friends‚ÄîAND CLAIM VICTORY!"

"HURRAH! HURRAH!" the crowd roared, their enthusiasm echoing through the air.

"Let's move out!" the emperor commanded as the gates of Immortal Skye opened, revealing the vast mountainous terrain that would lead them west to Lainwright Military Base. "Let's reunite with our families and meet those who may become part of our families in the future!"

‚ÄîAugust 14th, 2032 | Lainwright Military Base‚Äî

Lainwright Military Base, an expansive military complex sprawling over 160,000 acres, lay 80 miles northwest of Meridian City. Once boasting a self-sufficient ecosystem for soldiers and their families, the base featured military-focused facilities alongside a small city with restaurants, shopping centers, and services for civilian family members.

As the base of an international military superpower, nearly 50,000 soldiers once engaged in aerial jump exercises, firing range practice, and obstacle course training. An additional 40,000 civilian employees and family members lived and worked within the city, inhabiting single-family homes, apartment complexes, and barracks.

But the once-bustling base now resembled a ghost town, with the city, apartments, and off-site facilities abandoned. From an aerial perspective, a mere 6,000 people inhabited the core of the campus or trained in the recruit running grounds, which resembled a disused minefield dotted with holes.

Despite the early hour of 5 am, all 6,000 soldiers had gathered in the base's town square, their eyes fixed on a blonde standing atop a five-story building. The day's light breeze added a tangible chill to the anxious atmosphere as they awaited their leader's address.

"Today marks a pivotal moment for your future at Immortal Skye," General Skye informed her soldiers. "In just a few hours, the Immortals will arrive at the security checkpoint, seeking their families. Many will bring with them their strength, resentment, and hatred for the Maltian military."

Anxious murmurs rippled through the crowd, amplifying the tense atmosphere.

"However‚Ä¶" Evalyn's enigmatic smile appeared. "Each of you has protected their families. You've stood by my side‚Äîand earned my approval. I'm staking my reputation on you."

The Ice General's words pierced the soldiers' hearts, simultaneously lancing and alleviating their anxieties. For most, they hadn't realized the significance of having their general's support. Overwhelmed, several were moved to tears.

"Integrating with people who are generally stronger than you and hold higher status among the leaders won't be easy," she cautioned. "But Emperor Lexicon and I prioritize results, talent, and loyalty‚Äîdemonstrate these qualities, and you can surpass any Immortal."

Conflicting emotions washed over them, gripping them tightly. They struggled to believe her words. Could it be true?

"After all, I've requested a full transitional integration," Evalyn smiled. "If you prove your trustworthiness, adhere to our laws, and avoid causing trouble, you will all become Immortals."

Soldiers were rendered speechless, their words replaced by tears and choked emotions. The potent mix of anxiety and intense feelings overwhelmed them.

"You have two weeks to earn the Immortals' respect," General Skye announced. "Treat them with humility and respect, display your talent and determination, and don't hesitate to ingratiate yourselves. Until you earn the title of Immortal, you remain lesser citizens, so embrace your inner sycophant and only fight for justice or self-defense when no alternatives exist. Do you understand?"

The soldiers conveyed their agreement through various means, but the overall consensus was unmistakable.

"Do not lose focus," she commanded. "Just as the Immortals must overcome their hatred for you due to your people's actions, you too must overcome your hatred for innocent Sky Plane cultivators."

A wave of negative emotions infiltrated their minds, echoing the announcement.

"If you expect fair treatment despite your people's crimes against our families and the bombings, you must also accept the innocent Sky Plane cultivators," Evalyn said. "Thus, I will revoke pending Immortal status for anyone who commits a hate crime against one of our Sky Plane cultivators."

Her announcement doused them with boiling water, making their muscles spasm with overbearing shock, fear, and confusion.

"You cannot expect forgiveness if you cannot offer the same," Evalyn declared. "Are you petty, soldiers?"

"No‚Ä¶" they murmured.

"I didn't think so," she smirked. "Last I checked, you were elites. Was I mistaken?"

"No!" the soldiers shouted, regaining their momentum.

"Does that mean I can hold you to a higher standard than the Immortals or cultivators?" General Skye inquired.

"YES!" they yelled, declaring it passionately.

"Then remember your objectives, orders, and mission!" Evalyn ordered. "Now get prepared to welcome your people!"

***

Evalyn's eyes were fixed on the billowing dust clouds in the distance as the Immortals approached the neglected highway. She steeled herself emotionally; the sight of others reuniting with their families was bittersweet, a haunting reminder of her mother's loss.

Some wounds never truly heal; people merely learn to live with them.

Her companions shared her anxiety, their hearts pounding like war drums. The anticipation was almost unbearable, akin to the feelings experienced during the apocalypse or rapture.

Soon, a solitary figure appeared in the sky, stirring apprehension among the soldiers. However, recognizing the Cultivation God, they began excitedly whispering as he approached.

"Welcome, Emperor Lexicon," Evalyn greeted, kneeling respectfully. Shocked by her gesture, the soldiers hastily followed suit, dropping to the ground like falling dominoes.

"Lift your head, love," Kaze smiled, stepping beside her and helping her up.

"We're in front of soldiers, Kaze," she protested.

"Our soldiers," he countered, grinning. "I'm their emperor, and you're their queen; why would our people expect anything less from their rulers?"

General Skye blushed fiercely, eliciting cheers from those around her, who urged her to kiss Kaze. Gritting her teeth, she thought of how infuriating he could be and how often he put her in lose-lose situations. "This is unprofessional for a general who demands respect," she argued. "This is an important day for our soldiers, not a reunion."

"While you are generally correct, allow me to make an amendment," Kaze smiled. "It's an important date for everyone to reunite with their loved ones, and you're mine. As for you‚Ä¶"

Evalyn gasped in shock as she saw a flatbed truck carrying eight people instead of cargo. After recognizing their faces, tears welled up in her eyes. "I‚Ä¶ I should've expected this, but I was too afraid to ask."

"EVALYN!" a brunette called out from the truck, followed by children and other adults, all crying as they approached.

"Isabell!" Evalyn shouted back, tears streaming down her face as she raced towards them, oblivious to her soldiers.

"It's true!" a blonde exclaimed. "Evalyn! I'm so glad you're safe."

"Who are those people, Emperor Lexicon?" Sandra asked, her eyes choking with tears as she watched her general restrain herself from freezing the caravan to reach the people faster.

"Evalyn Skye's caretakers and their families," Kaze smiled, obscuring a subtle swallow as he watched the caregivers and small children jump out of the back of the truck as quickly as possible. "The people who truly raised her."

The onlookers observed as Evalyn embraced the children, their parents, and her caretakers, shedding her usual stoicism and allowing herself to be vulnerable. It was a heartwarming scene that seemed to halt time and instill hope in a world that had experienced so much since the apocalypse.

As most people watched in awe, a flood of individuals poured out from the military gates.

"BRADLEY!" a weeping brunette screamed, scanning the arriving caravan. She and her gray-haired husband immediately rushed towards it.

"REIN!" another shouted, overcome with emotion. As if the floodgates had opened, Immortals and family members ran towards each other, desperately calling out the names of their loved ones.
