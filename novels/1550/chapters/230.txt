Rein grabbed Steve Chung's arm and punted her shin into his crotch with considerable force.

"CuaahhHCk!" He coughed, making a horrifying sound as he grabbed his crotch, falling to the ground and wheezing.

All the men [and women] in the den groaned in despair, watching the poor Asian man hit the ground, eyes rolling to the back of his head.

"I don't care who you are or how nice you're being." Rein scoffed, "If you try to touch me without consent again, I'll curb-stomp your testicles until Minor Healing can't heal them!"

She waved her hand, healing the groaning man skillfully, and turned to the bar. "Bartender, can I get a towel to clean up this mess?"

The man behind the counter snapped to attention when addressed, nodded, and ran away.

Sage looked away and continued her conversation, convinced Rein wasn't acting as a spy. For her part, Rein listened carefully, hoping to get more information while she waited.

═─┈─═─┈─═

"Good for trust building, but…." Kaze muttered inaudibly, watching the ecstatic expression on the man's face in hyper-slow motion, "No one dares approach me randomly, least a talented, thrill-seeking rake."

A swift kick to the man's testicles could end the only chance a mercenary like her may get in a decade during the apocalypse. So he decided against such decisive action.

═─┈─═─┈─═

Rein casually took a step to the left.

"AhHHhHh WoOahHh AH—" Steve gasped, trying to grab her hand but finding nothing. As a result, he flew forward with momentum.

CRahSHh!

The previously-ecstatic Asian man flew into barstools breaking two of them and hitting the bar, knocking over a lot of drinks.

Pandemonium and chaos immediately ensued, with angry Immortals immediately screaming at the man for spilling their drinks.

Sage scoffed, unable to hear her conversation, and walked away as Mandy quickly tended to the situation, trying to keep the customers calm.

═─┈─═─┈─═

"Disaster." Kaze scoffed under his breath, "How can I do this without causing a scene?"

The situation seemed genuinely impossible to do without causing an issue.

═─┈─═─┈─═

Rein thrust her hand and grabbed Steve by the shirt, holding him in place. "Don't touch me without asking; you got it?"

"But I thought we discussed you were wanting more PDAs?" He said in confusion.

"I…." She replied in bewilderment, "What… I…."

"Gotcha!" Steve grinned.

The brunette's eyes filled with wrath and hellfire, pulling his chest to the floor and sending an elbow crashing down on his spine, trying to recover her reputation.

While she successfully managed to seem like Rein Joyfall, her genuine confusion didn't go unnoticed.

"Mandy, it's a bit noisy out here." Sage smiled, "Why don't we talk privately?"

"O-Okay sounds good." Mandy gulped, feeling her heart pace quicken as they walked away.

Rein watched the two walk away in vexation, wishing she could stomp the man's spinal cord further without ruining her reputation.

═─┈─═─┈─═

Rein thrust her hand and grabbed Steve by the shirt, holding him in place. "Don't touch me without asking; you got it?"

"I was just excited; please don't kill me!" The Asian man cried with tears welling in his eyes.

The short-haired brunette took a deep breath, wondering how she was supposed to act like herself in a situation like this.

After noting her hesitation alerted Sage, and the initiative was lost, she pulled Steve's crying face to the ground and elbowed his spinal cord—purely to release steam.

The manic fool destroyed his operation with a suicidal action and thus needed to get what he should have expected.

"Mandy, it's a bit noisy out here." Sage smiled, "Why don't we talk privately?"

"O-Okay sounds good." Mandy gulped, feeling her heart pace quicken as they walked away.

═─┈─═─┈─═

Rein thrust her hand and grabbed Steve by the shirt, holding him in place. "Don't touch me without asking; you got it?"

The reptilian part of the Asian's brain, cranked to the max for an hour of near-unbroken wins, snapped, and he grabbed Rein with unrestrained power.

With adrenaline already pulsing in his veins, his fight-or-flight reflex moved straight into kill mode, making him release his cultivation base.

Seeing Immortals in the vicinity that could get hurt over something unnecessary, Rein pulled her hand back in annoyance.

SLAP!

Whooooooosh! BOOM!

The brunette unceremoniously backhanded the crazed man, sending him flying into the wall.

"What have you done to the wall!?" Mandy cried, panicking with terror pulsing through her veins.

Contrary to expectations, Sage wasn't interested in exploiting her, so she poured herself another drink.

"Calm down." Rein said chillingly, walking past the business owner to the Asian man, "The Emperor expected this, so he reinforced these walls like the ones outside.

Besides, it's our duty to handle problematic situations that endanger other people. This idiot tried to release a real attack on your business; that counts."

Sage took a satisfying drink of whiskey as she watched Rein ruthlessly beat the man while professing the nuance behind the vigilante justice policy.

"I'm honored you respect me enough not to play games after showing your power." She smiled, putting her chin in her palm, "And horrified.

To think you could mask your cultivation with an illusion and act like normal people. I'll need to be on guard at all times now.

Shoulda let~em die, Emperor. Now, it'll be twice as hard to find fault with me. Not that you need evidence any~way."

═─┈─═─┈─═

Kaze clicked his tongue in frustration, playing through the scenarios. He chose Rein because no one approached her, let alone tried to grab her randomly!VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Moreover, the people she spent time with wouldn't be caught dead in a casino!

It was a truly obnoxious situation.

He looked at Steve's hand, getting within a few inches of his hand.

After glancing at his environment once more, he noticed the door opening.

When he saw who had opened it, he felt a desire deep in his soul to kill Sage Harrington, exile the woman walking into the room, and burn Kat's Casino to the ground.

None felt worth the vexation that he felt at that moment.

"Of course she'd arrive." Kaze scoffed breathlessly, watching [Kiera] enter the room alone.

As soon as the pink-haired teen caught a glimpse of [her real self], she panicked, seeing the Asian man reaching out to grab her body.

That panic told Kaze everything he needed to know about the situation—he couldn't elbow Steve in the spine. Just that alone made him feel deep bitterness from within his soul.

It was obvious. [Kiera] came to fetch Steve to talk to [Kaze]. If Rein went through enough trouble to convince a fiery lover to play along, it mattered a lot to her.

That, or she and Steve had planned the arrangement but forgot, so they were leading an extraction to prevent the operation from breaking down.

It was likely both. Either way, he couldn't go around elbowing him in the spine and had to play along lest he wished to ruin a potentially serious relationship.

So Kaze took a deep breath and let time speed up.

"Please come with me!" Steve requested, grabbing [Rein's] hand and pulling [her] to the dice area.

Kiera watched the confused brunette get dragged to the area with a perplexed expression, clearly never considering the scenario unfolding in confusion.

However, her face heated up like a thermometer when the Asian man got on one of his knees and held her hand with a pleading expression around a dozen laughing people.
