August 11th, 2032 | 23 Days Remain

A week swiftly elapsed since the battle, and Evalyn led her troops back to Lainwright Military Base to prepare for the integration of Immortal Skye. With her soldiers firmly under her control, things progressed more smoothly, and she gave them more free time in addition to letting them attend to their duties. The base quickly thrived under her charismatic leadership.

In recognition of their valor in defending the citizens, Eric's team and numerous others were granted sky realm techniques--a main objective of the staged event.

The Sky Plane cultivators assimilated into Immortal Skye, assuming instructional roles in exchange for access to new techniques. Harper taught combat strategies, while Roxy guided the Immortals in mastering the art of flight. The rest collaborated with former special forces personnel to teach tactical maneuvers and practice drills.

Flying wasn't like riding a bike. It involved the initial stage of magnetism, drawing Raw Qi around one's body for support and propulsion, using acupuncture points as omnidirectional engines. Even with enticing incentives and excellent instructors, the learning curve was steep.

As expected, everyone but Kiera and Evalyn had difficulty learning. Therefore, Kaze etched a flying technique into key individuals' minds, giving them basic flight knowledge as a prerequisite.

Though implanting techniques risked sparking controversies related to corruption and favoritism, Kaze's foresight in nurturing elites first allowed him to introduce new skills discreetly. After all, it was only natural for the exceptionally gifted to learn more quickly--just as it had always been.

In private sessions, Kaze patiently taught Jake the principles of magnetism, thereby fulfilling his debt. Although the regent would learn Divine Arrow before the conflict, it would serve as a trump card akin to Kaze's Harrowing Winds during the Killian War--a single-use strategic maneuver.

It would take years for him to use the technique and still function effectively afterward.

Mars, Amy, and Martha diligently trained the cabinet members, continuously refining their innovative techniques. Under their tutelage, the cabinet members made remarkable progress in mastering flying techniques and tactics. Yet, despite their dedication, it would take at least a month to become proficient in flying, let alone employing it in combat.

However, none faltered. They weren't relying upon flying to face their enemies--whatever they faced, they would face it head-on with what they had.

In contrast to Evalyn's troops, which she trained to have an unbreakable spirit, Kaze's forces cultivated a mindset of invincibility. They were training to be unstoppable--against anyone. Thus, their lack of knowledge regarding the impending invasion was inconsequential; they had perpetually prepared for it.

Kaze taught special techniques to Evalyn, Kiera, Kylie, Marilyn, and Addison at Lainwright Military Base nightly, which they accessed through a permanent spatial rift he had set up. Without knowing it, they were already traveling like Transcendent Planers.

The treasure farms flourished. Fey Roybock diligently tended to the Ergo fields, producing a bountiful crop that proliferated rapidly. Although treasures could take decades to mature in the Mortal Plane's soul Qi-scarce atmosphere, Kaze nurtured them and the Grave Robbers daily, using ultra-refined soul Qi and soul beast remnants as fertilizer.

Kaze's continued support of continuously Sage paid off. She expertly bolstered the economy by devising incentive programs for the Underground Bizarre. Through strategic partnerships, Immortals could acquire techniques by engaging in select businesses. Counselors, doctors, and brothel owners could learn spirit, healing, and dual cultivation techniques within six months, respectively.

The redhead ruthlessly drove Club Quinn and other enterprises out of business and set up a new program to attract competent replacements. While this approach was severe and resulted in substantial RP losses for investors, responsible investment during weekly auctions fostered serious enterprises rather than opportunists.

Consequently, genuine businesses and trends emerged, spreading rapidly and thriving. Karaoke bars enjoyed the most success, becoming even more popular in Immortal Skye than in Asian countries. Those who didn't visit the Underground Bizzare were equally puzzled as to why.

With Evalyn's return to Lainwright, Meridian City was ripe for the taking. As most zombies were either eliminated or succumbed to injuries, scavenging had near-unlimited wealth potential, leading to the rise of rival enterprises.

One enterprise, in particular, vexed Sage Harrington: the military. Lieutenant General Michaels and Major Ryker assembled a dedicated militia, with soldiers focusing on scavenging strategic economic equipment and heavy machinery. It not only secured all government contracts but also had unlimited government resources and scavenged machinery, such as distilling equipment, which adversely impacted her bottom line.

Still, that was Sage's greed and ambition talking. She excelled in her work and resided in the Executive's grandest penthouse, the most opulent residence in Immortal Skye. She had no grounds for dissatisfaction--this was merely a facet of her character.

In those ways, life progressed quickly. On the outside, everything seemed great--however, the scene remained murky beneath the surface.

"I appreciate you all making the time for this gathering," Kaze said gravely, seated around an elegant maple table in the Central Mansion's conference room.

A lot had changed since the apocalypse's beginning, which was evident at a glance. The once-small assembly of college students had grown substantially, now encompassing Daniel, Lieutenant General Michaels, Major Ryker, Roxy, Harper, and Police Chief Carmen Skeer.

Daniel's presence alone was unnerving to many, as the man had been spending time with his family until the integration of Immortal Skye and Lainwright. It was a calculated political move to prevent potential attacks on his family's life if something went wrong with the Lainwright families.DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

If tragedy struck and killed all the families, the cabinet members' families--secured in bunkers--would become objects of severe resentment.

Therefore, his presence indicated that the issue was relevant to his situation.

"In three days' time, we will incorporate soldiers from another base into our ranks," Kaze explained gravely. "Upon doing so, we will confront a three-pronged social crisis that we must address. We also have a serious matter stemming from Vincent Ramble's foolish scheme."

The cabinet members gulped, hearing there was a serious matter he couldn't solve directly.

"Why are we involved?" Roxy asked discerningly.

"Major Watson intercepted General Skye's forces while en route to the Immortal Skye subjugation mission," Kaze clarified. "Hostilities erupted instantaneously."

Both majors' eyes widened in horror, looking at the blonde for the first time.

"How heavy were the casualties?" Roxy asserted bluntly.

Evalyn closed her eyes and took a deep breath, feeling stress building in her chest. Her eyes had dark bags after dealing with the attack and prepping Lainwright Military Base for the assimilation.

--August 4th, 2032 | Meridian City--

"General Skye!" Riley's shout echoed as she burst into the military tent, her usually composed demeanor shattered. The redhead, once responsible for the family members, had become a lieutenant captain, her composure a testament to her steady rise in rank. Therefore, her sudden outburst was deeply unsettling.

"Speak frankly and tell me the situation," General Skye ordered, her face tense with concern.

"Cultivators!" Riley exclaimed, her red hair like fire in the dim light. "Martha and Calvin spotted fifty of them twenty miles east of our position. Should we take cover or engage them?"

Evalyn tried to respond but found herself at a loss. Earlier that day, Crux had departed to protect Immortal Skye in his absence, leaving her with Martha, Rein, Steve, and Larkin. That's all she needed to win in a fight, but... there was no chance for victory.

Only two weeks remained before integration, and their record was spotless so far. No citizens had perished or been injured under her command, and the soldiers had defended them with unwavering determination. Everyone had the opportunity for a peaceful assimilation.

Yet if even a single citizen perished, their flawless record would crumble, placing Immortal Skye's leadership under scrutiny. A political crisis on the eve of a major battle could be disastrous--the stakes were immense.

The Ice General knew she had to act decisively to minimize casualties.

"We must draw them away from our base," she commanded. "I will take the Immortals and confront them head-on. You're in charge of protecting the citizens; I will warn them against approaching, so prepare to be ruthless if they do."

"Yes, mam!" Riley said, saluting and leaving the room.

"Before we declare war, I refuse to ambush and slaughter these people," Evalyn murmured, taking a deep breath. "But if they prove barbaric enough to attack us without cause--not a single one will survive my wrath."
