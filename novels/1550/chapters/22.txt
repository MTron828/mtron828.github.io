Evalyn sat at her desk with her chin on her palm. She hadn't slept more than five hours a day in the last four days.

‚Äî

Uncle: Can you help with the inquiries? I don't have answers to most of the questions they're asking.

You: Heh. And you think I do? That's cute.

Uncle: Aren't you dating?

You: Are you mad? I haven't seen him for four days because he's sleeping with rich wives left and right! Why would you think that?

‚Äî

Evalyn threw her phone on the bed in protest and rested her head against her desk.

"Heh. That jerk didn't even text me about the faction, and Uncle thinks I have answers?" She scoffed in annoyance, "What a joke."

Her phone went off, and she took a deep breath. She ignored it and went online to see if there was anything new.

Despite her best efforts, she shot up from her position and typed in the URL for Yanko. It was her "job" to read comments to find clients.

"The guy acts like he used to love me but then leaves every woman satisfied by me." Evalyn laughed in self-deprecation.

"I used to think it was age. I probably look like a child to him, but now this?"

She closed her eyes.

"Charming me and then giving me this job make a dick move. I'm going to sleep!" Evalyn protested while opening her eyes and preparing to shut her browser.

"Hah. No exceptions, eh?" Evalyn giggled, "He's even going to make me work to get into his faction. I'm going to shove that in uncle's face."

She picked up her phone, prepared to counter his dating claims outright. However, when she opened her texting app, she stared at the message he had sent in disbelief.

‚Äî

Uncle: Aren't you dating?

You: Are you mad? I haven't seen him for four days because he's sleeping with rich wives left and right! Why would you think that?

Uncle: Why else would he name the faction Immortal Skye? While I sell the faction as a partnership, I assure you he didn't do that on my behalf.

‚Äî

Evalyn stared at the screen in disbelief, opening and closing her mouth, trying to find the words to say. "He said he'd spend a thousand years with me‚Ä¶."

Her eyes fell still as she stared at her phone blankly. An unknown amount of time passed before she snapped out of her daze.

"Who was I to you, Kaze?" She asked the empty room before shutting her laptop.

No matter how hard she thought about it, she could never figure out that riddle. According to the emperor, her past self was violent and rude to him.

While he might enjoy that, his mood always shifted when he spoke about her. It didn't feel like she was by his side to the last minute, present until the second that he left the fifth plane.

Now she got an even greater hint: Immortal Skye.

Evalyn felt the faction's name symbolized she'd live this time.

"How long did I live before?" She whispered, "To an immortal, a millennium could feel short. I killed thousands of people to get a Celestial Technique. That's lower than ancient, but how many years did that take? Centuries? Millenia?"

She shook her head. "I'm not going to get answers, but I do need to take a shower."
