When I arrived at the house in the royal capital, there were a gatekeeper, a maid, and a butler.

Grandpa said that Uncle Dis had dispatched them, but are the servants in this world temporary workers? In any case, I was surprised because I thought it would be just Grandpa, Grandma, and me living together.

"Living with just three people in such a huge mansion is quite unusual. About half of the rooms in this mansion are for the servants."

Is that so? It would have been nice if you had told me if you knew.

"Ho ho, it seemed so obvious that I forgot to tell you."

I see, is this common sense too?

"Rather than common sense, you could have figured it out with a little thought."

Grandma was exasperated with me. Well, I guess it's understandable. In my previous life, having servants was quite unusual, so it's hard for me to relate.

While we were talking, an older woman among the maids stepped forward.

"Nice to meet you, Lord Merlin, Lady Merida, Lord Shin. I am Marika, and I serve as the head maid of the Wolford estate. I may have some shortcomings, but I will do my best to serve you, so please take care of me."

"We will, thank you."

The maids all bowed simultaneously. The maids were dressed in black maid uniforms that reached their ankles with white aprons. Their skirts were not too short, and there were no frills. It felt more like work attire.

Of course, it's natural. Here, being a maid is a respectable profession, not about fashion. There's no need to dress up.

While I was thinking about these things while looking at the maids, a middle-aged butler came forward.

"It's a pleasure to meet you for the first time. I am Steve, and I serve as the head butler of this estate. I will take full responsibility for the management of this mansion, so please entrust us with your care."

"Please do."

There weren't as many butlers as maids, but there were butlers as well. What do butlers actually do?

"I will be serving as the head chef. My name is Korel. I will do my best to ensure your satisfaction. Please take care of me."

There's even a chef? What's with this VIP treatment? What about me? What am I supposed to do?

"You don't have to do anything, Lord Shin. Leave cleaning, laundry, and cooking to all of us."

Life in the royal capital had completely changed from my previous life. I used to wake up early out of habit, but now I didn't need to go hunting or prepare breakfast, so there was nothing to do even if I woke up early. In that case, I decided to practice in the morning.

After having breakfast prepared by Korel and the others, I focused on studying for the exams. However, since I already knew all the material, it was more about reviewing and confirming the scope of the exams.

After lunch, I found myself with nothing to do. It was challenging to pass the time, whether by wandering around the royal capital, going to the wilderness through the gate for magic practice, or any other way.

Among these activities, exploring the royal capital was the most effective way to kill time. When exploring the city, I had money for the first time in this world.

The currency in this world consisted of coins only, with no paper currency, as the technology to counterfeit paper money did not exist yet. The types of coins were stone coins, iron coins, copper coins, silver coins, gold coins, and platinum coins.

In a simplified comparison to yen:

Stone coin = 1 yen
Iron coin = 100 yen
Copper coin = 1,000 yen
Silver coin = 10,000 yen
Gold coin = 100,000 yen
Platinum coin = 1,000,000 yen

Even though they were called "stone coins," they were not just any ordinary stones lying around. They were made of a marble-like material and were honestly worth more than one yen. It was similar to the situation with the Japanese one-yen coin.

Well, the conversion to yen was only approximate, and it might not always match this exactly.

I hadn't earned any money myself yet, so I received an allowance from Grandpa. I received a few silver and copper coins and set out for a walk in the royal capital.

As expected of the royal capital, it was vast, crowded with people, and had numerous shops. There were also many street vendors, so I walked through the city, buying and eating grilled skewers while enjoying the sights. I also visited a magic tool shop that Zeke mentioned.

Honestly, the magic tools there were quite inferior and expensive compared to the ones Grandma made, so I left quickly.

As I wandered through the city, I found myself on a side street away from the main road. There were various shops in this area too, so I thought about exploring them when suddenly...

"Hey, stop!"

"You guys, cut it out already!"

"Oh, come on, don't be so serious! We just wanted to play with you."

"Yeah, yeah, it's fun to play with us, and it might even be enjoyable."

"Haha, it's no big deal!"

Oh, how cliché...

I initially considered ignoring them as just typical pick-up lines, but something felt off. It seemed like they might forcibly abduct me.

People passing by in the vicinity were avoiding eye contact and walking past. Well, the men bothering me were muscular and wearing leather armor, making them formidable opponents that ordinary people would hesitate to confront.

"Hey, miss over there, are you in trouble?"

I asked just in case, as I'd be extremely embarrassed if I had misunderstood.

"Yes! I'm in big trouble!"

One of the two girls being hassled shouted. While wondering what kind of response that was, I approached the men.

"What's up, kid? Do you need something?"

"Hey, you look pretty cool, like some kind of self-proclaimed hero."

"Hah! We're hunting monsters to protect these girls. We're the real heroes here!"

Ah, so these are monster hunters, I see. But...

"Hey, guys, while hunting monsters may be a heroic deed, isn't it villainous to go after girls?"

With that statement, the men's expressions changed.

"What did you say, you brat?"

"Looks like this kid won't understand until he learns the hard way!"

"Die, you punk!"

What won't I understand? Did someone tell me something about this? As I pondered this, one of the men lunged at me.

But they were so slow! Their movements were so obvious. I had gone through rigorous training with Michelle every day, suffering under the tutelage of the former Knight Order Commander. I was almost getting misty-eyed thinking about it when the fist approached.

So slow! I avoided the punch and grabbed his arm, tripping his leg. He spun around and fell without managing to take a defensive posture.

Oh no, he's not dead, right?

The remaining men, who had been watching, became even angrier and drew their swords without hesitation.

They were attacking without any hesitation. These men have killed before...

I dodged the descending sword and slipped into their guard, delivering a chop to their wrist. They let go of the sword, and it fell to the ground, immobilizing them.

The last remaining man swung his sword wildly, but he seemed wary of being disarmed. Unable to close in, he was left with no choice but to attempt a counterattack. I countered with a palm strike to his chin, causing his eyes to roll back, and he collapsed to the ground.

After defeating the men, I looked at the girls. They appeared to be stunned, staring at me.

"Are you okay? Did you get hurt?"

"Uh, um, I'm fine! Um, are you okay? They had a sword out...," the girl who had asked for help responded.

The girl had slightly slanted, large, brown eyes, and a small and quite cute face.

"Oh, I'm fine. I wouldn't get hit by such slow sword swings."

"Huh... I thought they were quite sharp..."

The other girl muttered. She had long, navy-blue hair... navy-blue hair!? What's with this hair color that's directly challenging my genetics!? With that thought in mind, I looked at her face.

It was like a lightning bolt struck my brain...

She had slightly drooping, large black eyes, a straight nose, and glossy, plump lips that looked like they were coated with lip gloss. She was a beautiful girl.

"Um, is there something wrong?"

The girl, who had captured my attention, spoke with a bewildered expression and a bright red face.

"Huh? Oh, no, it's nothing. I'm just glad you're not hurt."

I hurriedly replied. Oops, I got lost staring.

"I got so scared. I thought something had happened."

"Oh, sorry about that. Everything's fine. But more importantly, should we leave this place?"

In response to the question from the girl with chestnut hair, we moved away from the scene. It must have been quite a scary experience for the girls, as one of them was still trembling slightly and her feelings hadn't settled, so we decided to enter a nearby café to calm down.

"Let me thank you again. Thank you for helping us in such a dangerous situation."

"Oh, thank you."

"No, no, it's no big deal. They weren't that strong."

I said, and the girl with chestnut hair muttered with a frustrated expression.

"If only I could use magic, I could have easily taken down those guys."

She's saying something ominous.

"No, Maria, you can't use attack magic in the middle of the city."

"I know, Shishiry. It's just frustrating that I couldn't do anything to those guys!"

I see. The girl with chestnut hair is Maria, and the girl with navy-blue hair is Shishiry.

"Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't even introduce ourselves. I'm Maria, and this is Shishiry."

"I'm... Shishiry."

"Nice to meet you. I'm Shin. By the way, Maria, it seems like you can use magic. Are you a student at the Advanced Magic Academy?"

"No, not yet."

"Not yet?"

"Yeah, if I pass the entrance exam next month, I'll become a student at the Advanced Magic Academy."

"Wow, Maria, you're taking the entrance exam next month too?"

"That's right, together with Shishiry. Wait, 'too'?"

"Yeah. I'm also taking the exam."

With that, both of them looked back at me, their expressions puzzled.

"Oh... Even with such great martial skills, you're a magician?"

"I thought you were a student at the Knight Training School..."

There's a Knight Training School too.

"If we both pass next month's exam, we'll be classmates. Let's do our best in the test."

Saying that, I reached out for a handshake.

"Of course! I'm aiming for the top entrance exam, so I won't lose."

"Haha, well, I'll do my best."

"What's the matter? You're not competitive at all."

I exchanged a handshake with Maria, who pouted a bit. Then, I extended my hand to Shishiry.

"Um... uh..."

She didn't shake my hand.

Oh, right. I guess it was a bit forward to initiate a handshake with someone I just met. Maria is quite bold.

"Hey, what's up, Shishiry? Are you feeling okay?"

"Huh? Oh, no, it's nothing!"

And she took my hand, a bit more energetically this time.

"So, let's both do our best."

"Yes, I'll do my best!"

Then, we let go of each other's hands and returned to our seats. Maria then asked me a question.

"By the way, Shin, which middle school did you attend? We're the same age, but I've never seen you before."

"Oh, I just came to the capital recently, so it's natural you haven't seen me."

"I see. Oh! Speaking of newcomers to the capital, have you heard? The Wise Sage and the Master Enchanter have recently returned to the capital!"

"Oh, uh, I think I've heard... something like that..."

"What's with you? Aren't you interested? Wise Sage Merlin, the savior of the kingdom, a legendary magician who fearlessly hunts monsters, and Master Enchanter Merida, who wields magical devices and looks nothing like what you'd expect from her beautiful appearance! As long as you're living in this country, or rather, in this world, they're the ultimate figures to admire!"

Uh-oh, I'm about to faint...

"Um... are you okay?"

Shishiry asked me with a concerned voice while I was having my own little meltdown. I'm in big trouble... I must seem extremely suspicious right now.

"What? You're reacting strangely."

"Yeah, um, Maria, you really like Wise Sage and Master Enchanter, don't you?"

"Of course! Who doesn't like them, except for people with something sinister in mind?"

"R-right."

"That's right. And their grandchildren are going to take the entrance exam for the Magic Academy soon!"

Seriously? Has that news already spread around?

"Oh, I wonder what kind of person he is? I'm grateful to be the same age as that person."

She seemed to have calmed down quite a bit, and it smelled like danger to stay together any longer, so I decided to part ways here. Since the two of them were still here, I grabbed the bill and stood up.

"Hey! We'll pay for our portion!"

"It's fine, it's fine. Letting the girls pay is uncool. Let me handle this."

Saying that, I settled the bill and left the café.

Today turned out to be quite interesting. Encountering a classic scenario, having tea with a cute girl, and... Oh, Shishiry was really cute...

Oh no! I forgot to get their contact information!

Oh no, what a grave mistake! After acting all cool, it's impossible to go back now!

Ugh... But they mentioned that they were both taking the entrance exam for the Magic Academy. If they pass, we'll meet at the academy. Okay, I'll definitely pass too!

I'll pray for Shishiry to pass as well. Maria seems likely to pass anyway.

After Shin left, Maria and Shishiry remained at the café, having a conversation.

"Sigh... He was pretty cool, wasn't he?"

"Yeah..."

"He's good-looking, strong, seems to be skilled in magic enough to take the Magic Academy's entrance exam, and on top of that, he's not pushy."

"Yeah..."

"...He was cool when he left too, right?"

"Yeah..."

"Hey, can I kiss him?"

"Yeah..."

"Heh... Hey, is it okay if I get him?"

"Yeah... Eh! No!!"

With those words, Shishiry finally snapped back to her senses. Maria, watching her reaction, let out a little chuckle.

"Geez, Maria!"

"Haha, sorry, sorry. It's just the first time I've seen you like this, Shishiry."

"Ugh..."

"So, what? You didn't fall for him all cheesy-like because he helped us, right? Like those clichéd heroines in stories?"

"I d-don't think... I don't... But..."

"Huh? Wait, for real?"

"I don't know... but, um... when I look at his face, I get really nervous... My heart races... I feel all warm inside..."

"Wait, wait, seriously?"

"Yeah..."

In a place unknown to Shin, another story was also unfolding.
