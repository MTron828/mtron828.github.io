"Frequent incidents have stopped happening?"

"Yeah, suddenly. What in the world was that?"

Engaged in his recent daily routine, the development of magical tools at the Bean Workshop, Oug had come to check on Shin. Oug seemed genuinely curious about what Shin was making, and he often came to see what was going on. It was quite clear that he didn't fully trust Shin.

"And I'm supposed to believe that the reduced violence in the capital is due to Alice and her group?"

"Surely, that's not it."

Of course, it wasn't. Alice and her group appeared in the capital in those outfits only once. They moved around with optical camouflage, so only a few people caught glimpses of them. There might have been some rumors, but almost nobody saw them in person. It was hard to believe that something like that could act as a deterrent to crime.

"It hasn't completely stopped, but it's back to the previous levels before the increase in incidents."

However, it was true that the number of crimes had decreased.

"Maybe people were getting more anxious?"

"No, that's a definite possibility. But it doesn't seem related to this recent spike in incidents."

As of now, the campaign to conquer the demon territories was not over. The targeted demons were defeated, but there were still many monsters in the demon territories. If they didn't thin out their numbers as much as possible, they wouldn't be able to govern the territories effectively once they were divided among the various countries. While the operation had shifted its focus to clearing out the monsters, it was far from over.

In addition, while they had defeated the demons that attacked various countries, the mastermind of the demons, Strom, was still at large in the former imperial capital, and many demons remained there. It was impossible not to feel anxious. So, Shin's speculation was that the recent increase in incidents might have been a result of the built-up stress.

"What could it have been?"

"I don't know. I have no idea... By the way, Shin, what have you been working on?"

Shin was considering the recent increase in incidents while adding magical properties to the components he had on hand. Oug, noticing this, became curious.

"This? It's a part for carriages."

"This is?"

Oug held up a circular metal piece and examined it closely.

"What's it used for?"

"It's a bearing."

"I see. So, what does it do?"

"It might be easier to understand if I show you rather than explain."

To demonstrate, Shin showed a sample wheel with the part installed.

"Try turning it."

"Like this?"

Oug turned the set wheel by hand, and it started spinning easily.

Oug was surprised by how smoothly it turned. When he noticed the wheel kept spinning, he voiced his confusion.

"Hey, this wheel won't stop?"

"It just keeps on turning."

"Why?"

Thor and Julius were also taken aback.

What Shin showed them was a ball bearing. When they passed a large horse-drawn carriage in the town of Frägel, its wheels had been squeaky as they rotated. When Shin investigated, he found that although bearings were present, ball bearings were not used.

So, Shin decided to develop this bearing on its own and offer it as a part to carriage manufacturers. Since he wasn't in the carriage-making business and no one else was making them, he didn't feel like he was taking work away from anyone. As a result, it might lead to having an excess of horses since a carriage could be pulled by fewer horses due to the reduced burden, but he believed that increasing the number of carriages could address that issue. After all, the capital was quite vast.

Additionally, this bearing had a specific enchantment – "Rotation." By channeling magical energy, it generated a force for light rotation, essentially providing power assistance. The power of light rotation was not to be underestimated. It significantly reduced the burden on horses pulling carriages, allowing them to run as if they were unburdened.

Shin and the Bean Workshop team had already conducted various experiments, and the results were confirmed. This led to the creation of hybrid carriages, making long-distance travel less taxing for horses and faster. So, increasing the number of carriages for long-distance travel seemed like a good idea.

As the carriages became capable of high-speed travel, there was another important development.

"You come up with various things, don't you?"

"But with that kind of speed, wouldn't it be hard to stay on the carriage?"

"That's right. That's why I made a suspension system."

"Suspension?"

When speed increases, the previous carriage structure becomes uncomfortable to ride. To address this, they developed a new mechanism: the suspension.

Shin, accompanied by Oug and others, visited the department where they were creating the suspension. There, Mark and other craftsmen were working on the suspension.

"Ah, Your Highness. What brings you here?"

The artisans showed respect to the crown prince when he appeared, but Mark, who was often with Oug, was more relaxed and able to speak without the same level of formality.

So Mark handled Oug's visit.

"Just a moment ago, I saw this component from Shin. I heard they were making something called 'suspension' along with it."

"Well, Waldford is truly amazing. We didn't even think of this concept."

That's right! Mark didn't say "I," which was incredibly disconcerting, but that's how he always was with Oug.

Mark explained the suspension to Oug.

"Before, we used leaf springs attached under the carriage to minimize shaking, but this suspension aims to absorb shocks at the wheel level from the get-go."

"Absorb shocks?"

"Yes. Take a look here."

"This is..."

What they were constructing here was an independent four-wheel suspension.

Since carriages were pull vehicles, they didn't have shafts connecting the wheels. Each wheel moved independently, controlled by dampers.

"This suspension absorbs sway through vertical movement, and the dampers return it to its original state quickly. So, continuous shaking becomes a thing of the past."

"Indeed, there are quite a few things I don't like about that."

"I'm not a fan either."

"I tend to get motion sickness from it."

It seemed Julius was prone to motion sickness.

Well, even though there was still some swaying, it wasn't as severe as at higher speeds, so it worked well enough.

"When I introduced this to the carriage workshop, there was a tremendous response. They haven't caught up with the production of the bearings and suspension yet."

"Oh, I see. It's selling that well. But I haven't seen it yet..."

"They're in the process of making and modifying them right now, I think. Especially the modifications are entirely new systems, so they take some time to produce. Oh, but we presented one to the palace the other day. I heard His Majesty was using it?"

"..."

One prototype carriage incorporating these bearings and suspensions was shown to Mr. Dis, who really liked it and accepted it as a gift from the Bean Workshop. Having the royal family use it was the best advertisement.

But Oug apparently hadn't heard about it.

"I didn't know."

"Your Highness, you usually use the gate for transportation, don't you? I don't recall seeing you use a carriage recently."

"It's only natural I wouldn't know, as I don't use carriages."

Well, if he doesn't use carriages, it's only natural he wouldn't know. Most likely, Oug hasn't seen a carriage lately.

But that's only the case for a limited few, or rather, those who can use the gate. Carriages are essential means of transportation for ordinary people.

"So, I think soon carriages equipped with this will be running all over the capital."

"I don't quite understand you. Sometimes you make something incredible, and other times you make things that help everyone."

"In other words, you're saying I rarely do good things?"

"That's right."

"You're ruthless!"

I always think about making things that benefit everyone. But before that, I've made something else.

"Oug, Thole, Julius, get the wireless communication devices."

"Huh? Sure, but what's going on?"

"I've made improvements."

They then brought out improved wireless communication devices.

There were two main improvements this time. One was adding a ringtone for incoming calls.

The other was increasing the number of devices.

The ringtone was like a bell, similar to a black telephone. When a connection was established, a small bell installed inside the communication device would ring. The recipient could silence the bell.

As for the numbers, up until now, they had dials similar to those on safes, but now they've been replaced with dials that are more like a bicycle chain lock. You turn the dial to align the numbers, and you can assign up to 9,999 different combinations.

While it takes some time to set the dials, it allows us to increase the number of wireless communication devices at once. This was just completed the other day, and I haven't given it to Mr. Dis yet.

I'll give one to Grandpa and Grandma later. This way, we won't make mistakes like not being able to coordinate like before.

With the operation coming to a close, we need to coordinate well. But I won't let these circulate for now. If kings and heroes could be reached with such simple numbers, the communication devices would ring nonstop.

For now, they are intended for the upper echelons of the country. The announcement of magic stone mining is still pending, and first, we need to establish fixed communication devices.

"You made this too. Isn't this overdevelopment?"

"The workshop's craftsmen are the ones making them."

"You're making them too much... Are you properly compensating them?"

"There's no issue there, Your Highness. The orders from the Waldford Company have significantly boosted sales, so everyone's salaries have been increased. Thanks to Mr. Waldford's ideas, we also provided bonuses at the end of the year. Everyone wants to compete to do work that Mr. Waldford is involved in."

"Is that so? Well, that's good."

"Hello~"

Mark was discussing the working conditions of the employees, and a woman's voice sounded from the entrance of the workshop.

"Huh? Why is Carlton here?"

The one who appeared was Yuri.

"Oh my? It's not His Highness."

Oug was surprised that Yuri appeared at the Bean Workshop, and Yuri seemed equally surprised.

"Carlton-san is helping us with the bestowal of that dryer and hair iron."

"Is that so?"

"Yes, Merida-sama said it's necessary to handle the numbers, so I'm helping out at the Bean Workshop as a part-time job."

"Your dad said he wanted Carlton to become an official craftsman here, though."

Yuri, who had been increasingly considered as Grandma's successor, was advised by Grandma to handle more numbers, which is why she had started working at the Bean Workshop as a part-time job.

Originally thought to be Grandma's successor, Yuri was already an immediate asset to the workshop.

Rather, she had been the head of the Magic Bestowal Department from the moment she joined.

In response to this, my dad was quite serious about scouting her for the workshop.

Well, they are Ultimate Magicians, so it seems they gave up on the idea of becoming full-time employees quickly.

"It's a great part-time job that combines practice and profit."

"Yuri-chan! You finally made it!"

As we were talking with Yuri, a craftsman from the newly established hairdryer department came running up to her.

"Geez, the sales of hairdryers and hair irons are amazing. We can't keep up with making them!"

"Oh my, well then, I'll go, Your Highness."

"Yeah. Do your best."

"Huh? Your Highness?"

"Well then, let's go."

"Hold on, really?"

That craftsman didn't even notice that Oug was there. They must be quite busy.

"Well, I've seen how Shin is doing. I'll go do what I can as well."

"So you really came to check up on us?"

"If you don't check regularly, you never know what mischief we might get into."

It's like a company audit...

"Oh, right. Hand this to Uncle Dis for me."

"Hmm? A wireless communication device?"

"I'm not giving them to the representatives of other countries yet. Uncle Dis is the only one who knows that artificial magic stones can be made."

"Will you give them to the representatives of other countries after the announcement?"

"That's likely."

"Understood. I'll give it to him. What's the number?"

"Fifteen. Thirteen is grandpa, and fourteen is grandma."

"Can't have a number younger than the two of them..."

"I think Uncle Dis will be considerate."

He's Uncle Dis's master, and his respect for him remains unchanged. Grandpa and grandma probably won't mind, but Uncle Dis is likely to care.

"Indeed, received."

"Then, Shin-dono."

"I'm off."

"Yeah. I'll be waiting for the operation to finish early."

And so, after my "audit" – not really, it was more like monitoring – Oug and the others left.

The year has already started for a while, and it's about time for significant movements in the operation. Before that, there should be an announcement about the conditions for excavating magic stones. Also, there were apparently more applicants than ever in the recent entrance exams for the Advanced Magic Academy.

The number of enrollees remains the same, so the competition rate was also the highest ever.

I'm looking forward to seeing the outstanding juniors who managed to pass through such high competition rates. The increased circulation of magic stones is also expected to revitalize the magical tool industry.

Above all, this incident has strengthened the connections between various countries.

Once the magical creature incident is over, there should be a great leap in human development waiting ahead.

I hope that there won't be any more incidents beyond this point, and with Oug, well, I think we'll be just fine.

"Then, have we been able to thin out the magical creatures in the Demon Territory smoothly?"

"Yes. Since the defeat of the demons, we haven't seen any catastrophic-level creatures appearing for some reason, so things are going very smoothly."

"I see, catastrophic-level creatures, huh... Auguste, what do you think?"

In the conference room of the Earlshide Royal Castle, members of the kingdom's upper echelons had gathered to discuss the future. Among them, regarding the circumstances of catastrophic-level magical creatures not appearing, Deseum sought Auguste's opinion.

Auguste is the Crown Prince, but he's also a member of the Ultimate Magicians, and he has extensive combat experience with the demons. Seeking Auguste's opinion was a common practice due to his substantial experience with these adversaries.

When asked by Deseum, Auguste, after a moment of thought, shared his predictions.

"...To begin with, we rarely used to see catastrophic-level magical creatures. It was only when demons began appearing in large numbers that the numbers of these catastrophic creatures increased. Then, with this large-scale defeat of the demons, their numbers decreased... it might be proportional to the number of demons."

"I see. That makes sense. What do the rest of you think?"

Agreeing with Auguste's opinion, Deseum nodded. He asked the people in the conference room for their opinions.

"We can only acknowledge His Highness's insightful perspective. It is probably the truth."

"Yes. That seems likely. Auguste-dono, as expected, your insights are truly extraordinary. I can only admire you."

"Indeed."

The people asked for their opinions readily praised Auguste's conjecture. Naturally, there was some flattery for Auguste due to his royal status, but he is, in fact, the second-ranking member of the Ultimate Magicians. His words as the third 'Thunder God' in addition to 'Demon King' and 'God's Messenger' held immense influence and were blindly trusted by the upper echelons.

Auguste's opinion was reasonable, and it seemed like the truth itself.

However, Auguste harbored some concerns as he witnessed this scene.

He had shared his opinion as one of the possibilities, hoping that it would lead to discussions that brought forth alternative viewpoints. This way, he expected that things he might have overlooked or entirely new approaches to the situation would emerge.

But, in reality, Auguste's opinion was accepted as correct and unchallenged, and no further debate occurred. Even though Auguste himself had suggested the possibility of his conjecture being wrong, the upper echelons, without any other plausible theories, had adopted his opinion as it was.

In the end, the reduction in the number of demons was attributed as the cause for the decrease in catastrophic-level magical creatures. Based on this conclusion, a new operational plan was devised.

Since catastrophic-level creatures were not appearing, it was deemed acceptable to reduce the number of deployed troops and have them rotate in and out. The primary reason for this decision was the increasing psychological burden on the soldiers who remained in the battlefront.

While the public desired a swift resolution to the crisis, the soldiers' well-being also had to be taken into account.

Auguste's opinion had pushed for the relief of the soldiers' burden.

And the change in the operational plan indicated that the situation was rapidly approaching its final stages.

As discussions proceeded quickly towards the conclusion, Auguste couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy.

"If Shin were here, he would have presented a different possibility..."

Auguste couldn't help but think this in the absence of Shin in this situation.
