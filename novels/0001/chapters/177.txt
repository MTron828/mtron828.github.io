 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

After Shaolin said that, she fell silent.

Looking at Shaolin, Og muttered softly, "I see."

Then, Og began to speak about what he understood.

"So, if there are books with ancient language that can help create powerful magical tools, wouldn't it increase the number of people who can understand ancient languages? And would that lead to a repeat of past tragedies? Is that your concern?"

"...You are correct," Shaolin said, as if squeezing the words out.

"What do you think? Were there really no such books with that knowledge?"

"I can assert that there aren't."

"I see..."

Shaolin breathed a sigh of relief as if from the bottom of her heart.

Was that why she was so desperate to question me? Perhaps she had suspicions that there might be books that could endanger the world. That's why she was so determined. But...

"Nevertheless, wasn't your approach rather forceful? What did you plan to do if you upset Shin's mood with this?"

"Huh? Oh... I didn't think about that."

Hey, she hadn't thought that through? Well, I won't get angry since I have my own hidden agenda, but seriously, isn't she being a bit thoughtless?

"Um, I'm very sorry!"

"Eh!?"

Shaolin trembled slightly at Og's words and suddenly prostrated herself.

I saw someone prostrating themselves for the first time in this world! Even Leifan!

"Wait, wait! Please stop!"

"No! I can't lift my head until I've received forgiveness for casting such suspicion after asking for my sister's help so shamelessly!"

"I'm sorry!"

No matter how much I tried to tell Shaolin and Leifan to stop prostrating, they wouldn't listen.

Oh, come on!

"Alright, I get it! I really don't mind, so please lift your heads!"

"Is that true? Will you really continue treating my sister?"

"I will, I will! I will definitely continue the treatment!"

"Thank you! Thank you!"

Finally, the two of them stopped prostrating.

Prostrating is a humiliating form of apology for the one who does it, but it's not pleasant for the one receiving it either. It's almost like being forced into an apology. Making someone do such a thing in public is uncomfortable in itself, and not forgiving them despite making such a humiliating gesture can make one appear narrow-minded.

Finally, when Shaolin and Leifan stood up, Og said in a casual tone, "So, is your business with us finished?"

"Yes, we apologize..."

"In that case, let's rest. We'll be traveling all day tomorrow, and even just sitting down accumulates fatigue."

Og said this and quickly walked towards the tents.

"Right... Both of you, rest well. Goodbye."

I followed Og into the tent, and as soon as I entered, Og started talking.

"I don't like those two."

"Huh?"

"We've been cooperating with them, thinking it was for helping people, but... It seems like they are hiding something."

"...I had a hunch too."

"Old languages from the previous civilization, and magical tools unearthed from ancient ruins... I'm curious about how relieved they were when they found out there were no books with ancient language."

"Could it be that it might become troublesome?"

"I can't say for sure. As long as they don't say anything, we can only speculate."

"Well..."

"In any case, it's dangerous to trust them completely. Be prepared for anything."

"Alright."

After our conversation, the others returned as well. I needed to tell everyone about my conversation with Og before Leifan returned. I also had to talk to the women. In any case, let's stay cautious.

Later, Silver laid the women to rest in their tent and repositioned the beds. At that time, I saw Shaolin and Leifan having a conversation. When they noticed me watching, Shaolin awkwardly averted her gaze. Oh, that confirms it. They are hiding something.

Nevertheless, while I sympathized with Shaolin's situation before, I'm finding it hard to trust her now. I've decided to be prepared for anything.

With that in mind, I went to sleep.

Shaolin and Leifan, who had seen Shin and the others off to their tent, were left alone to talk. Their conversation revolved around Leifan's premature apology.

"Miss Shaolin, I'm sorry."

"Sigh... honestly, you timed that poorly."

"I'll accept any punishment."

"It's fine. I'm the one who got carried away emotionally."

"But..."

"Besides, who could have dreamed Lord Shin could understand ancient languages? It's just an accident, unavoidable."

"I understand."

"But..."

"What is it?"

"We revealed a lot of things..."

"...Well."

"Oh well, it's not like we're deceiving anyone. Selling dragon leather and asking for your sister's treatment aren't lies."

"Even if those guys are involved?"

"Uh..."

"Huh?"

During their conversation, Shin, who was on his way back after moving Shaolin and Silver's beds to the women's tent, made eye contact with them. It was too dark to discern expressions, but they were definitely looking in their direction.

Feeling guilty, Shaolin quickly averted her gaze without nodding, then she bit her lip and said, "Everything is just speculation. So, we didn't know anything, right?"

"Yes, Miss."

Then, they both entered their respective tents.
