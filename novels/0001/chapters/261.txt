When I said that, Royce, my brother-in-law, scratched his head with a chuckle, and Alice blushed and looked down.

Who's this?

Alice.

Huh? Alice!?

"Hehe. You're so cute, Alice."

"What!? Sicily!?"

Alice, who didn't expect to be teased by Sicily, protested while still blushing.

It only confirmed what I had imagined.

"Well, I never expected the two of you to be together. What's the story behind this?"

So far, I hadn't heard of any connection between Alice and my brother-in-law Royce.

I'm very interested in how these two got together.

Then, with a smile, my brother-in-law Royce explained.

"Oh, you know, I'm the managing director of the Wolford Company, and the president is Mr. Glenn."

"Oh, yeah. I remember now."

Alice is a member of the Ultimate Magicians. Since I saw Glenn as the president of the Wolford Company, I had completely forgotten that they were related.

I see, that's the connection.

"Because of my position, I often go to the president's house, which is Alice's house. We met a few times, had conversations, got along well, and eventually started going out together... That's the story. It's not that unusual, is it?"

"Yeah, it's not that unusual. But if it weren't Alice..."

"Ugh... W-what's that supposed to mean?"

Just a few months ago, Alice was lamenting that she would never get a boyfriend and might remain like this forever. She never dreamed that something like this would happen. It was so surprising that it was still hard to believe.

Then, there was a sound of the grass being scraped.

What's that? When I looked in the direction of the sound...

"Miranda..."

It was Miranda again.

She must have been looking for us in a panic after we disappeared. And when she found us and ran here, she saw Alice having a picnic with my brother-in-law Royce.

And then, with the same momentum, she collapsed on the grass.

What is she doing?

"Alice... You too!"

"Wow, Miranda!?"

"You! You can't escape from this situation, right? You're not going to claim that you just happened to have some free time, are you?"

"Huh? I-I won't say that, but... Wait! Why are you giving me such a piercing look, Miranda? And you too?"

With a tone that seemed as if someone else had made the same excuse, Alice tilted her head.

In response, Miranda had a bitter expression on her face and turned away.

"Maria was with a guy too..."

"Huh!? No way! Who, who is it?"

Alice asked, but Miranda didn't answer.

Oh, right, I remember now that Miranda and Mr. Cartas have some acquaintance, but they haven't really talked much.

"It's Mr. Cartas. He said he happened to invite her because there was no one else available on a day off."

"Eh? That's definitely a lie. You should ask for more details."

"If I do that, I'll probably get bombarded with questions, you know?"

When I told Alice that, she blushed but didn't show any signs of rejection.

Oh, this is...

"Well... it's fine. We can't hide it forever now that the scene has been witnessed, and there's no point in keeping it a secret..."

Alice said while glancing at us.

Huh?

Who's this?

Alice.

Huh? Alice!?

I never dreamed that Alice would have such an adorable reaction!

"Ah! Fine, I admit it!! You damn brat, you got me to admit it!"

Miranda cried out while pounding the grass in frustration.

...Was it that frustrating for her?

We had just encouraged each other with Natasha a little while ago to face the reality, but I guess being left behind in reality is frustrating.

While I couldn't help but sympathize with Miranda's situation, Sicily was focused on something else.

"Well! Does this mean there's an announcement coming soon, my dear brother!?"

Sicily's eyes sparkled as she approached my brother-in-law Royce.

Wait, an announcement?

"Sicily, what do you mean?"

Is my brother-in-law Royce going to make an announcement that he's dating Alice?

When I asked that, Sicily shook her head and said, "No."

"My dear brother Royce is the eldest son of the Viscount Claude's family. Our father believes that he is capable and has already decided that Royce will be the next head of the family."

"Really? That's news to me."

The nobility in Earlsheid is a bit unique. Just being the eldest son doesn't automatically make you the heir. You must be competent and capable of managing the estate without issues. This applies to the royal family as well. And Royce, my brother-in-law, has already been recognized as the next Viscount.

This is quite impressive. Has his performance at the Wolford Company been recognized?

However, it seems that's not the main point of the conversation.

"In other words, my brother has a duty as the successor of the Viscount's family. That duty is to get married and have children."

"Marriage... Ah, I see."

"Yes. Instead of announcing that you're dating, it's about announcing an 'engagement.'"

"Engagement!?"

Miranda, who was supposed to be in a similar situation, was shocked to learn that Alice, in addition to dating, was considering getting engaged. She sat on the grass, looking up at the sky in astonishment.

...Maybe it's best to leave her alone for a while.

Alice, who had caused this shocking revelation, was strangely flustered.

"Alice?"

"!"

"My brother?"

"Ahaha. Sorry. I haven't actually proposed yet."

Sicily froze upon hearing Royce's words. Then, she gave him a stern look.

"Could it be, my brother? Are you just playing with Alice?"

Although Royce is Sicily's actual brother, Alice is a friend she has been through thick and thin with since their school days. It's one thing for outsiders to be playmates, but for her family to be involved in this way, Sicily probably can't accept it. So, she was scolding her brother Royce with a stern demeanor.

However, Royce was desperately trying to defend himself.

"No, no! I'm serious!"

"Then why?"

"I proposed, but I haven't received an answer yet!"

Royce shouted while Alice turned beet red as if steam was coming out of her head.

So, they had already gone that far, huh?

...I had no idea at all.

But, ah, so that's it.

"Is Alice's inquiry to Oug about noble-commoner marriages the reason for this?"

I remember that at the Ultimate Magicians' office, Alice had asked Oug some unusual questions.

"Shin, Alice consulted with His Highness, right?"

"Yes, she asked a while ago if there were any issues with noble men marrying commoner women."

"When was that?"

"It was a few days before the Ellie attack incident."

When I said that, my brother-in-law Royce's eyes seemed to glisten with emotion.

"I proposed recently, but she had been thinking about it for so long? I'm happy."

In response to Royce's sincere words, Alice blushed and shrank again.

"So... Can you ask me again, Alice? Will you marry me?"

Royce took Alice's hand with a serious expression, and Alice...

"......Yes!"

Even though she was embarrassed and looking down, she gave a firm consent.

"Wow! Congratulations, my dear brother! Alice!"

"Ahaha, thank you, Sicily."

"Uh, uh..."

In response to Sicily's sincere compliments, my brother-in-law Royce responded with a smile, and Alice seemed to be overwhelmed, only saying, "Uh, uh."

"Congratulations, my brother-in-law."

"Yeah, thanks."

"Congratulations, Alice."

"Huh?"

Seeing Alice still dazed, I came up with a little prank.

"Oh, I see. With this, Alice will become the Viscountess."

When I said that, Alice, who had been dazed until now, seemed to regain consciousness. Her happy expression turned into one of despair.

It's as if she just remembered.

"I remembered... That's right, if I accept this, I'll become a noblewoman!"

"Yes, that's correct. My brother is set to inherit the title of Viscount, so you will become the future Viscountess."

"What!? What should I do!? Will they say things like, 'How can a commoner woman like her'!?"

So, that's what Alice is worried about.

But, isn't that just unfounded anxiety?

"There's nothing to worry about, Lady Alice. You are a member of the Ultimate Magicians and a national hero. While many people will offer their blessings, there shouldn't be anyone condemning you. If anyone were to criticize Lady Alice, they would be unworthy of being called nobles."

"Why?"

Perhaps because her concerns were dismissed, Alice asked Natasha-san with genuine curiosity, without the earlier agitation.

"It is not an issue for those who are already nobles. However, there are some challenges when it comes to newly ennobling members of the Ultimate Magicians. There's a potential concern that having the Ultimate Magicians, known as the country's greatest strength, closely connected to one nation might raise questions."

"Oh, so that's why Shin can't become a noble."

"It's not only Shin-sama. The same applies to Lady Alice and other commoner members. By marrying a noble, they can be ennobled. Those who criticize this would be undermining the country. If you hear any criticism, it might be best to sever ties with those individuals."

"Wow."

Alice gazed at Natasha-san, who explained this smoothly, with a stunned expression. I was surprised too. Natasha-san is not just a regular clergywoman.

Maybe it was because I looked surprised, but Natasha-san started to explain from her own experience.

"Just to clarify, my family holds the position of Cardinal in Eastland. The Cardinal in Eastland is somewhat akin to a noble in this country. It's only natural to have such knowledge."

"I see."

Although usually she's such an airhead, why is Natasha-san actually so high-level? We all watched Natasha-san with admiration, except for Miranda, who was lying down. Then, Natasha-san cleared her throat and continued speaking.

"What Lady Alice should be concerned about isn't there."

"Huh? So, there's something else to be concerned about?"

"Yes, it's not so much a concern as something you need to learn."

"What's that?"

"Noble etiquette."

"!?"

At Natasha-san's casual words, Alice's eyes widened.

"It's inconceivable that Lady Alice would be looked down upon because of her background. However, there is a chance you could face unwarranted criticism if you lack proper manners."

"Huh? Even though I'm not against becoming a noble?"

"That's correct. Lady Alice, you wouldn't feel comfortable if you were surrounded by people who don't follow the rules, would you?"

"Well, I suppose that's true."

"It's just like that. If someone doesn't follow the rules everyone else is abiding by and behaves recklessly, they'll be criticized as 'brutes,' 'barbarians,' or 'sloppy.'"

She's quite specific with these derogatory terms.

By the way, Natasha-san in Eastland...

"Barbarians..."

"Anyway! That's why! All Lady Alice needs to worry about is learning proper etiquette!"

"Yes!"

Alice reflexively saluted in response to Natasha-san's sudden outburst.

It's understandable that she'd be surprised when told this so suddenly.

But why...

"Shin-sama."

"Oh, yes."

Natasha-san, with a smile but also exuding unwavering pressure, addressed me.

I had no choice but to comply.

"About what you just mentioned... Please keep it a secret."

"What you just mentioned? Oh, barbarians."

"Shin-sama!"

"Oh, sorry."

I guess the nickname "Barbarian Priestess" isn't something she likes.

I almost said it without thinking.

I need to reflect on that.

While I was being scolded by Natasha-san, Alice, with a determined look in her eyes, spoke to Sicily.

"Hey, Sicily."

"Yes? What is it?"

With a serious expression, Alice made a sincere request to Sicily.

"You know, Sicily, could you teach me noble etiquette?"

Sicily responded with a smile and a nod to Alice's sincere and earnest request.

"Yes, of course. Becoming my brother's bride also means becoming my sister-in-law. I'll be tough on you, sister-in-law."

"S-Sister-in-law!?"

Oh, right.

Alice will become my brother Royce's wife, so she'll be my sister-in-law.

"Let's get along from now on, sister-in-law."

"Yes, sister-in-law."

"Arichan?"

"Uwaan! Only Silver is on my side!"

Oops, I might have teased her a bit too much.

She was reacting so amusingly when I kept calling her sister-in-law, but she eventually turned to Silver and cried out for help.

"Ahaha, sorry. Oh, by the way."

"Ugh, what now?"

"While I think it's a great idea to have Sicily teach you noble etiquette, there are other noble girls closer to you, right?"

"Oh, Maria?"

"Yes. It seems like it would be more convenient in terms of scheduling and such, so why Sicily?"

I might consider asking Maria for help as well, but from the atmosphere earlier, it seems like Alice has a strong preference for getting exclusive instruction from Sicily.

So, when I asked her, Alice made it sound like it wasn't a big deal.

"Oh, that's because, you know, Maria seems a bit too laid-back."

...

Snort!

Chuckle

"Hahaha! Indeed, Maria does seem a bit too laid-back!"

We couldn't help but laugh at Alice's words, even though we knew it was best not to. Even Miranda, who had been crawling on all fours on the grass a moment ago, had gotten up and was now laughing heartily.

It seems like she has recovered from the emotional shock.

With Alice's engagement happening right before our eyes and potential progress with Maria, things were looking up. Now, I just hope Miranda and Natasha-san find their own happiness too.

That's what I thought on that holiday.
