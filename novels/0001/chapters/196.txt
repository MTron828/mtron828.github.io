When Shin was hearing a shocking story from Leafan, the other members of the Ultimate Magicians were struggling to keep the dragons away from the village.

"Oh, it's another herbivorous dragon!" Alice exclaimed as she spotted a dragon using her scouting magic.

"Yeah, it's pretty challenging to redirect them away from herbivorous dragons," she mumbled while preparing her magic.

Then, she cast a powerful explosion spell with reduced intensity.

"Gyaaah!"

"Oh!" Alice unintentionally cried out when she misjudged the distance and caused an explosion right next to the herbivorous dragon.

The herbivorous dragon slowly collapsed. Although Alice's explosion spell didn't hit it, the close-range explosion created a loud noise and shockwave, causing it to faint.

"Ugh... I have to drag it away again," Alice grumbled. She had already repeated similar failures several times, so she sighed and grabbed the tail of the herbivorous dragon, using body-strengthening magic to pull it away.

"There aren't many carnivorous dragons, and herbivorous ones faint instead of running... Ugh, it's so annoying!"

Frustrated by her lack of progress, Alice mumbled while dragging the herbivorous dragon.

After a while, they reached a specific location.

"Sigh... Let's see... one, two, three... this is the fifth one."

There were four herbivorous dragons lying unconscious in that place, and the one Alice had just brought made it the fifth.

"I understand that we can't let it become like the previous village, but this is way too dull!" Alice complained.

So far, all Alice had done was try to release herbivorous dragons and, when that failed, drag them here. She had only defeated a few carnivorous dragons.

"Sigh... Tiring work, this monotony," she sighed.

At that moment, Alice sensed several sources of magical power approaching.

"Huh?"

Realizing the situation, Alice waited, and what appeared were multiple carnivorous dragons.

"Huh? Why? There were hardly any of them just a moment ago..."

"Oh, come on!! Wake up already!" Alice yelled at the herbivorous dragons, despite being the one who had knocked them out.

It might sound heartless, but she couldn't stand being attacked by the carnivorous dragons any longer. While defeating the carnivorous dragons, Alice tried to kick the herbivorous dragons who were still unconscious to wake them up.

Her efforts seemed to pay off as one of the herbivorous dragons finally woke up.

"Oh, finally awake!"

The herbivorous dragon, just awakened, found itself surrounded by carnivorous dragons attacking and magic being cast to fend them off. The chaos was overwhelming, and it didn't take long for the newly awakened dragon to get confused and start thrashing about.

During its frenzy, its massive tail swung dangerously towards Alice.

"Watch out!... Ah..."

Alice managed to dodge the tail, but her kick, lacking the body-enhancing magic, couldn't compare to the force of the herbivorous dragon's tail. It hit the other unconscious herbivorous dragons hard enough to wake them up.

"Hey... Wait... Ahhh!"

One awakened dragon started thrashing, then woke up the next one, and the cycle continued until all five herbivorous dragons in the area were awake.

In their confused state, the herbivorous dragons began to panic, leading to chaos. Carnivorous dragons attacked herbivorous ones, and Alice tried to escape, while the chaos made it impossible for her to keep track of her original intent.

"Enough..."

Alice muttered and gathered as much magical power as she could, creating a massive fiery sphere above her head.

It surprised the dragons. In their bewilderment, they stopped focusing on eating herbivorous dragons or attacking Alice and instead stared in amazement at the enormous flame she had conjured.

Alice's eyes were wide open and filled with rage.

"You won't listen, you attack me, and even when I protect you, you attack me..."

Mumbling to herself, her demeanor appeared unusual even to the wild dragons. She clearly looked unhinged.

"That's it! All of you, get blown away!"

With a final shout, she released the massive fireball, scattering the dragons in all directions.

Such words from Alice, who had caused this situation herself.

It was a complete fit of anger.

But given her irritation at how things were going, to have this situation on top of it, Alice couldn't help but explode. Without hesitation, she aimed the massive fireball she conjured at the dragons.

The dragons were in no condition to handle this. The dragons, who had been engaged in a battle for survival moments ago, both herbivorous and carnivorous, fled together, narrowly avoiding the direct impact of Alice's magic.

However, even though they avoided a direct hit, the dragons were still blown away by the shockwave. Previously, it was the herbivorous dragons who had passed out from this, but this time, there was no time for fainting.

Fainting meant getting caught!

With that thought in mind, they quickly got back on their feet and fled for their lives.

The dragons didn't look back, and there was a good reason for that.

"Wait!"

Alice, with a terrifying expression, had unleashed multiple spells while chasing after them.

The dragons managed to evade the oncoming magic and continued their escape.

Running and running... finally, they managed to shake off Alice. When they realized it, they had been driven deep into their habitat.

In the end, Alice had unintentionally succeeded in guiding them according to her initial plan.

"Are there any dragons here... are there any dragons here..."

Later, when Alice was searching for the dragons while muttering these words, her fellow companions who witnessed the scene described her as looking like a legendary demon, and they couldn't help but say so.
