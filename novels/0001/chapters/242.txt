"Saint Cecilia's Pregnancy"

The news of Saint Cecilia's pregnancy spread like wildfire throughout Arsheid and even to other countries.

Congratulations and gifts poured in from all around the world, primarily from national leaders.

...When you put it into words again, it's truly amazing.

Not only gifts but also people who came to offer their blessings in person.

"Congratulations, Cecilia. Haha, even though you already have experience raising Silver, it's your first time giving birth, right? You can do it."

"Yes, thank you, Your Holiness."

The one congratulating Cecilia was the High Pontiff of the Creator God Religion and the national leader of the Holy Eos Kingdom, Ekaterina.

With Silver sitting on her lap, she spoke words of celebration to Cecilia.

Ekaterina actually visits our house quite often, even going out of her way to let me know in advance.

She pays attention to Silver every time she comes over, so he's grown quite fond of her, the High Pontiff.

"Silver, you're going to be a big brother soon."

"Big bwother?"

"Yes, a big brother. Maybe a little brother or a little sister."

"Bwoder? Sistew?"

"Haha, we don't know yet, but promise me, Silver, that you'll protect them as a big brother."

"Yes!"

Silver probably doesn't understand yet, but he responded based on the atmosphere.

But more importantly...

"Um, Ekaterina, could you please stop calling yourself 'baa-chan'?"

"Huh? Why?"

"Why, you ask! You're not Silver's grandma, are you?"

"Mmm, I'm his child's child, so I think it's fine."

"Why are you so stubborn about that!"

Since the day we took in Silver, Ekaterina has insisted that he's her grandchild. This is related to the fact that Ekaterina was once engaged to the son of Silver's grandparents, and unfortunately, the engagement ended when her fiancé passed away before they could get married.

Silver was supposed to be the grandchild of her fiancé's parents, but she's projecting that onto me.

So, in Ekaterina's eyes, I am considered her son, and Silver is her grandson.

I understand her feelings.

I do understand, but saying that here is not appropriate!

"W- Wait, you don't mean to say... that His Holiness is the High Pontiff's secret child?"

"Come on! You're misunderstanding right away!"

Since I asked Natasha to take care of Cecilia, we've been together as usual today.

Being a devout follower of the Creator God Religion, Natasha probably thought I would readily believe in the theory that I'm Ekaterina's secret child!

"Oh my, I might have gone a bit too far with the joke."

"You definitely went too far."

"Huh? Huh?"

"Haha, Natasha, Shin is not my son. Well, I think of him as a son in a way."

"Huh? So... a stepson!?"

"No way!"

Even though she rose to the position of a bishop at such a young age, why is Natasha so unfortunate? Honestly, the only decent clergy I know is Makina.

"Well, joking aside, Natasha. It seems you're going to take on the duty of protecting Cecilia."

"Yes. I was told by His Holiness to do so."

"Very well. Is that okay? You will protect Cecilia and her unborn child at all costs!"

"Yes!"

"Is this your fault, Ekaterina!"

"Huh?"

Is Natasha willing to lay down her life on every occasion because of Ekaterina's guidance?

"No, I won't let her do that. It's just a figure of speech, Aya."

"Some people really believe it, though..."

"Oh?"

It's not 'oh', it's not 'oh'.

Ignoring my complaints entirely, Ekaterina turned her gaze to Miranda, the other guard accompanying Cecilia.

"Miranda, please take good care of Cecilia as well."

"Yes, haha! If it's a command from His Holiness, I'll also stake my life to protect Cecilia."

"You too!?"

Why is it that people associated with Ekaterina always seem eager to sacrifice their lives?

"No, Miranda, you can't. You're Cecilia's friend, so it would be sad if you became her substitute."

"Huh, oh, I'm sorry. You're right. If it comes to that, I'll just carry Cecilia and run away."

"Haha, please do."

It's been almost three years since Cecilia and Miranda met.

Maria seems to be the closest to Cecilia, but she had been fostering a good friendship with Silver as well.

"Oh my, you chose Miranda as Cecilia's guard because she's Cecilia's friend, didn't you?"

"Yes, that's one reason. But also, when it comes to strong female knights, Miranda is the best I know."

"I see. Until now, the best one was Christina..."

"Yes, big sister Chris..."

"Right now, she's pregnant."

"That's right, Christina is actually married now and expecting a child."

Moreover, the partner is...

"I never thought that she'd marry Zeek."

"Is that so? I always thought those two were a perfect couple."

"Huh? What made you think that?"

Those two used to fight all the time when they met.

When they came to report their marriage, I was so shocked it felt like the world turned upside down.

Even now, if you go to their new home, they're always arguing.

"I've seen those two cooperate on the battlefield, to the point where they don't even need signals. They were so perfectly in sync."

"Is that so?"

"Haha, so you're saying those two were just acting shy?"

"No, I don't think that's it."

I used to think they seriously hated each other.

But that changed when I found out about their rivalry as a knight and a mage.

"Because Natasha's magic alone might not be enough, it's really helpful that Miranda is joining as a guard."

"No, why are you saying it like that?"

"Huh? Cecilia's stepmother..."

"I can't take this anymore!"

Why is she so insistent on that?

Because of things like this...

"Grandma, a book."

"Oh, you want to read a book. Leave it to grandma."

"It's too late!"

Silver recognizes Ekaterina as his grandmother!

What am I going to do!?

"Well, this is... I've acquired an unexpected title."

"Huh? What's wrong, Aug?"

As I was fretting over Silver recognizing Ekaterina as his grandmother, Aug arrived through a gate.

"It's been a while, Shin."

"Huh? This is unusual, Ellie."

Ellie also appeared from behind Aug.

By the way, it's been a while since Ellie came to this house.

"So, what brings you here all of a sudden, Ellie?"

"Well, there's something I wanted to report."

"Report?"

"Yeah."

With that, Aug turned his gaze towards Ellie.

Under Aug's gaze, Ellie looked away shyly and placed her hand on her belly.

...Huh!?

"H-Hey! You don't mean...!?"

"Yeah. Ellie is also expecting a child."

Whoa, seriously! Ellie, too, following Cecilia!

"Ellie-san! Congratulations!"

"Thank you, Cecilia. Let's both have healthy children."

"Yes!"

"Well, isn't this a joyful occasion!"

Even Ekaterina, who had been reading a picture book to Silver, joined in celebrating Ellie.

"It's wonderful! Let's celebrate today."

"What are you talking about? Go home already."

"Huh? I'm fine today. I made sure to finish my work."

"Really, that's the only thing you're responsible about."

"Hehehe."

"I'm not praising you."

With those words, Ekaterina playfully tapped the top of Ellie's head, but it didn't seem to hurt at all, and Ekaterina's cheeks relaxed in response. It's clear that Ekaterina is the one enjoying this occasion the most.

"How about it, Your Highness, do you have some time after this?"

"Yes, we made time as well, so it should be fine."

"I see. In that case, shall we have a celebration for the Queen's pregnancy?"

When Granny said that, everyone cheered.

"Oh, but my cooking should be on the lighter side, if possible..."

"Oh? Is the Queen experiencing severe morning sickness?"

"Yes, I eat, and then it all comes back up... Light foods are okay, but... What about you?"

"Cecilia is also experiencing severe morning sickness. She can barely eat anything except for light items or fruits."

"I see..."

"So, if we prepare the same dishes for both Cecilia and her, it should be fine..."

Granny had said that and then she cut off her words, looking behind me.

Huh? What?

Thinking that, I turned around, and there was a new gate that had opened there.

"Oh, Wolfrord-kun, good evening."

"Go-Good evening."

Coming out of the gate were Mark and Olivia.

"Well, if it isn't Mr. Bean and Mrs. Bean. What brings you here?"

Olivia, who was once again referred to as Mrs. Bean by Aug, was no longer flustered. This was because, amidst their busy activities with the Ultimate Magicians, Mark and Olivia had also held their wedding and become an official couple.

"Well, we're here to report something."

With Mark's words, Aug and I exchanged glances.

"Report? Don't tell me..."

"You're not going to say that Mrs. Bean is pregnant, are you?"

"Huh, you got it right. Yes, that's right, Olivia is pregnant, and we came here to report it. We really didn't expect Your Highness to be here."

Upon hearing this report, Aug and I burst into laughter.

"What's so funny!? Why are you laughing!?"

"No, sorry, we didn't expect such a coincidence."

"Coincidence?"

"Well, Ellie is also pregnant and came here to report it."

"Huh!? Really!?"

"Wow! Congratulations, Ellie!"

"Thank you. Congratulations to you too, Olivia."

"Thank you!"

I never expected Olivia to be pregnant at the same time.

"Hahaha! This is really joyous. Alright, Mark, Olivia, join us for dinner! Oh, don't worry. We've prepared light meals for the pregnant ladies."

"Since we're all here, why don't we invite everyone? Cecilia's pregnancy was celebrated grandly too, after all."

"Hoho, that's a good idea. Let's have a banquet to celebrate the new lives."

"Alright, now that it's decided, Correll! Correll! Get ready for a banquet!"

Granny was full of enthusiasm as she headed towards the kitchen.

Left behind, Aug and I watched Granny, who was in high spirits, in astonishment.

"She's quite something, isn't she? The Archpriest is the most powerful one."

"Y-Yes, she is."

Among them, Ellie and Olivia were constantly amazed.

"Hehe. That's right. I've raised Shin-kun, my son, and my grandchild, more energetically than anyone else."

In such an environment, Cecilia, who had seen Granny up close, understood her well.

Raising sons and daughters is completely different, after all.

And since I've only been raising boys, I guess it turned out like this.

"Raising Shin-san..."

"Indeed, it must require quite a bit of energy."

"Huh?"

It seems like you're not quite agreeing in the same direction, but well, it doesn't matter.

Afterward, we contacted everyone with our radio communication devices and gathered at the Wolfrord family estate. We invited the staff of the Ultimate Magicians as well and held a banquet.

Among the guests was senior expectant mother, Chris-nee-chan, who had a pretty sizable belly. They shared essential knowledge and items for expectant mothers with the three women whose bellies would gradually grow.

The three of them listened earnestly to the valuable advice from the active expectant mothers.

...Wait, doesn't the royal palace provide everything for Ellie?

Furthermore, Lilia, who had married Tony, Karen, who had married Thor, and Sarah, who had married Julius, also attended, engaging in lively conversations among the wives. The atmosphere was even more festive than Cecilia and Maria's joint birthday celebrations held annually, to the point that it didn't seem like an impromptu gathering.

However, this was a celebration party for Ellie and Olivia's pregnancies. While Maria and Alice genuinely congratulated them, I worried that they might start complaining again about not having boyfriends and disrupt the party.

But for some reason, the two of them remained cheerful throughout and genuinely celebrated Ellie and Olivia.

Well, they wouldn't explode with complaints at such a joyful event, would they? Besides, both of them are already working adults.

At that time, that's what I thought.

And the next day, the news of "The Crown Princess's Pregnancy" spread throughout Arlsheid, enveloping it in an even more festive atmosphere than Cecilia's time. design principles
