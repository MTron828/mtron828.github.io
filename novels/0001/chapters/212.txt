"What... What does this mean? Are you saying that we've been lied to all this time?" Shaolin couldn't help but ask the general.

By the way, Leafan was translating Shaolin's words for them.

In response to the question, the general continued speaking while avoiding eye contact with Shaolin. "It's not an absolute lie. Those who have consumed the magic stones have all died without exception. Some died immediately, while others died after some time. However, none have lived a long life."

Dying without exception, unable to live a long life.

So, in the end, they are all dead.

Where's the difference in that...?

Wait a minute. I remember that consuming magic stones makes magic unstable.

The Hao we defeated earlier gained the ability to use magic after consuming a magic stone, but his magic became unstable, and he turned into a demon due to the mental strain. And then, he was quickly subjugated...

"Ah."

I inadvertently let out a voice, and the general turned his gaze towards me.

"Did you notice?" he asked.

"Yes. Those who consumed the magic stones all died without exception. But the truth is a bit different. So, it means that the cause of death is not the consumption of magic stones, but..."

"That's right. Those who consumed magic stones are more prone to transformation into demons... No, based on the records so far, they undoubtedly turn into demons. In that case..."

"The cause of death is... killing under the pretext of subjugation?"

"That's right."

I had initially thought of those who consumed magic stones as being poisoned. In fact, Shaolin and the others likely believed the same. That's why there is strict control in the workshop that processes and refines magic stones.

But in reality, those who consumed magic stones turned into demons without exception and died as a result.

"Is that even possible?"

Even Shaolin, who heard this story for the first time, couldn't hide her shock. It was such a shocking revelation.

I see... I understand why this can't be talked about.

I now understood the meaning behind the general's insistence on keeping it a secret.

However, this raises another question.

"I'm sorry, that was a rather mean way to put it. By the way, we couldn't do anything the first time we faced a demon. Despite being told from a young age that demons were terrifying beings in our country. In the end, if it weren't for Shin dealing with them, we might not be here now."

"That's right. However, Shin-dono truly surprised us. We never dreamed that he would defeat the sinners so easily."

Oug and the general said while looking in my direction.

Well, it's a bit embarrassing to be praised all of a sudden.

"No, well, we've been dealing with demons who still retained their reason until now. We simply no longer see those who have lost their reason and turned into demons as a threat."

"I see. You've been through quite a lot at your age."

"Well, it's been something."

"In any case, the reason for Hao's defeat is probably due to not gauging Your Highness and Shin-dono's strength."

The general said as he watched Hao's body being collected by the soldiers who were working behind us.

"In that case, it raises even more questions. Why do you call demons 'sinners'? They are humans who have transformed into demons, so wouldn't it be more appropriate to call them demons?"

When Oug asked this, the general looked puzzled.

"Why... because they have violated the law by consuming magic stones and transforming into demons. Those who have committed a crime... are called sinners, right?"

Looking at the general as he said this, I realized something.

"Um, by any chance, are there any other individuals who have become demons other than those who consumed magic stones?"

"There's no way that would happen. Only those who have consumed magic stones without exception become sinners."

"I see..."

With this, the earlier question has been resolved. The only ones who become sinners in Kuang Long are those who transformed into demons by consuming magic stones. The demons we know of didn't become demons through magic stone consumption. This is still a hypothesis, but it seems that high-level magic users, driven by strong resentment and hatred, cause their magic power to run rampant and turn into demons. That's why the demons my grandparents once subjugated were so powerful that they almost destroyed the country, and Strom attempted to create a demon army to conquer not just the country but the world.

In contrast, in Kuang Long, people who originally couldn't use magic become unstable due to consuming magic stones, and something triggers their transformation into demons.

Their original power is low. Those who became demons by consuming magic stones are significantly inferior in terms of abilities compared to the demons we've faced.

That's why we were able to subdue them.

"Thank you. I've come to understand a lot of things."

"Ah, but as I mentioned earlier, please remember that this is strictly confidential. The same goes for all of you."

"We understand."

The general spoke to us in a requesting tone, but he was rather authoritarian when addressing Shaolin and the others. It seems that there's a difference in attitude between foreigners and the people of their own country.

Both Shaolin and the others seemed quite intimidated.

"Is there anything else you would like to inquire about?"

"Yeah, sorry for taking up your time."

"Well, then, I have post-processing for this matter, so I will take my leave."

The general gave a bow to Oug and then headed towards the busy soldiers.

We watched him go and sighed unconsciously.

"We heard quite an incredible story..."

"That's right. Even Shin didn't know about this."

"Of course not. I didn't even know the existence of magic stones until I received them at the academy."

"That's true. Well, I think everyone understands the threat of demons better than anyone, so I don't think they'll speak of it. But be careful not to accidentally let it slip, especially you, Hughes."

Oug directed this warning at Lin among all of us.

"Your Highness, that's cruel. I understand that I shouldn't talk about this. Besides, why just me? Alice should be cautioned too."

"Hey! Lin, isn't that a bit harsh?"

"Hughes, you have been coming in and out of the Magic Academy. You often discuss magic, don't you?"

"That's true. There are frequent discussions about how those without the aptitude for magic can learn to use it."

"Among those discussions, is there any talk about what it takes for someone without magical potential to be able to use magic?"

"We do discuss it quite often. This recent discovery is... ah."

Oh, this is a trick that Oug often plays on me.

As expected, Lin started trembling, and Oug gave him a stern look.

"I'm telling you to change that way of thinking!! Got it? You must absolutely not talk about this! In fact, forget it altogether!"

"I can't do that. It's stuck in my brain."

"Should I make you forget, then?"

Oug smiled while maintaining an angry expression and surrounded both of his hands with lightning.

Scary...

"I forgot. I won't remember it anymore!"

Lin seemed to have been quite scared as well and stood still, saluting while desperately trying to convey that he had forgotten.

Seeing Lin's attitude, Oug dispersed the magic power he had wrapped around his hands.

"Good grief... For now, let's consider Hao's matter closed. We'll wait for Kuang Long to contact us about the timing of resuming negotiations. Let's go back."

With that, Oug walked toward the exit of the Royal Palace of Yuehong.

Now that the biggest obstacle, Hao, is gone, it would be good if things proceed smoothly.

While discussing such matters, we walked back to the Min family's residence.

The next day, in some regions, there was a commotion as something fell from the sky. However, the truth behind why such an incident occurred remained unknown. It became a mysterious event that would be talked about for a long time in the capital city of Kuang Long, Eilong. with concepts
