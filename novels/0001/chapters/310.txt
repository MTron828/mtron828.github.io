After visiting the graves of Milia and my parents a few days ago, we were following the annual tradition and had come to the Rittenheim Resort as usual.

This Rittenheim Resort is operated by the Rittenheim Marquess family and is a very popular resort destination among the wealthy. However, Julius is the next lord of this domain, so we receive various privileges.

It's all about connections. There were times when I worried if we were being envied by others since it's a popular resort that's hard to book, but since Julius is widely known as a member of the Ultimate Magicians, people now understand that he's simply inviting friends to his own territory. Knowing this, we feel at ease when accepting the invitation.

This time, we were also invited, and first, we came to greet Julius's father, the Marquess of Rittenheim.

"Long time no see, Marquess Rittenheim. We appreciate your hospitality again this year."

"It's been a while, Lord Shin. I'm thankful for you coming to our place again this year."

"No, thank you for inviting us every year. These kids are also looking forward to spending their summers here every year."

I said that and turned my gaze to the children.

"We appreciate the invitation. Thank you!"

"Thank you!"

"Thank you, sir!"

Silver expressed gratitude politely, while Shal and Sean energetically greeted.

Seeing that, Marquess Rittenheim narrowed his eyes and said, "Hmm."

"They seem to be growing up as cheerful and well-behaved children. It's great to hear that from you, Lord Shin. Your annual visits to our territory have elevated its reputation, and there's nothing I could be happier about if we can repay your kindness."

"Oh, no, we're the ones who are grateful for your kindness every year."

"So, I was thinking of covering your stay expenses..."

"No, that's not necessary."

"Hmm, I see."

Close call. Marquess Rittenheim insists on covering our stay expenses every year. It's because he believes that our annual summer vacation here raises the status of the resort. Rejecting this has become an annual ritual.

After going through that ritual this year, I shifted my gaze to Julius, who was standing next to the marquess.

"Julius, it's been a while."

So, after leaving the room with just our family, we were guided by one of the Rittenheim family's maids to where Thor and the others were.

The maid knocked on the door and announced our visit, and we were invited into the room.

"Lord Shin!"

Of course, Thor was inside, and when we entered the room, he stood up and welcomed me.

Just like Julius, it had been a while since I had seen Thor, who had also semi-retired from the Ultimate Magicians.

One of the purposes of our annual visit to the Rittenheim Resort was to meet up with friends we hadn't seen in a while, and this included Thor.

I greeted Thor with a handshake as we caught up.

"It's been a while, Thor. You look well."

"Thanks. Lord Shin, you seem unchanged as well."

As we exchanged greetings, Thor gave me a sharp look.

"What's the matter?"

"You still don't know when to stop, do you, Lord Shin? What's the deal with that Magic Car?"

"Oh, so you played with the one I sent."

"Yes, I did. Thanks to it, Annabelle kept throwing tantrums, saying she wanted to play too. She's only three years old, and she can't activate magical tools yet, so she tries and fails each time and ends up crying."

Annabelle is the daughter of Thor's wife, Karin, and she is the same age as Julius's son, Joann. Their fathers have been childhood friends and best friends, and since they have a gate, the two kids frequently meet.

"Yeah, it seems to be the same in every household."

"Well, to be honest, I couldn't help but find it fun myself. Not just for the kids, but it's gaining popularity among adults as well. But why did you decide to make something like that?"

I explained the conversation I had with Aug the other day about why I decided to make the Magic Car. After listening to the story, Thor placed his hand on his forehead and sighed.

"You did this already while I was away for a moment? I can't help it, but I'm starting to regret leaving His Highness's side."

"But there's no choice. The next lord can't stay as Aug's aide forever."

"I know, but..."

Thor said that and directed a slightly lonely gaze at me.

"I never know when Lord Shin will become the center of some commotion, and it's somewhat lonely to be left out of it."

"I see."

While I still meet my friends from the High Magic Academy on a regular basis, my encounters with Thor and Julius have become much less frequent due to their respective roles.

In the past, we used to witness and engage in all the commotions caused by me or Aug up close, but now, I can't participate like before.

Although it's unavoidable, I couldn't help but feel a melancholic atmosphere settling between us as I realized the nature of our current relationship.

"Well, it's no use talking about it. So, Lord Shin, since it's been a while, let's enjoy our reunion."

"Yeah, that's right... Wait a minute! Isn't Thor starting to talk strangely?"

"Oh? Is that so?"

"You... have you been spending too much time with Aug? You're starting to resemble him."

"How rude. Shouldn't it be more like you, Lord Shin?"

"Why!?"

"It's because you don't realize it, which is so like you."

Thor said this with a laugh, then walked over to where the kids were enjoying their reunion.

"Joann! Anna!"

"Sean!"

"Kyahaha!"

The three toddlers of the same age were calling each other's names, hugging, and laughing.

It's amazing how much joy they can find in simply meeting and calling each other's names.

"Really, Sean is such a little child... Kyoa!"

The toddlers couldn't help themselves since they were still very young, and they jumped on Shal, as if to say, "Play with us!"

For Joann and Anna, Shal was someone they often saw and played with, like a big sister.

"Shal-chan!"

"Hey! Why are you both jumping on me at the same time!?"

"Ashobo!"

In addition to Joann and Anna, Sean joined in, and they all pleaded with Shal to play with them.

With the three toddlers ganging up on her, Shal turned to Silver, who was watching and laughing nearby.

"Look! Big brother is here too! All three of you, jump on big brother!"

"Wow!"

"Silver-niishu is amazing!"

Shal, as if sacrificing Silver, who seemed to say she couldn't handle three toddlers, urged them to jump on their big brother.

Silver, who suddenly found himself under the attack of the three toddlers, witnessed an astonishing scene.

"Oh, you three are full of energy."

"Wow!"

"Silver-niishu is amazing!"

"Amazing!"

Silver effortlessly caught the three toddlers who had jumped on him, and to make it even more remarkable, he held Sean in his right arm, Joann in his left arm, and Annabelle on his shoulders, carrying all three of them at once.

Even for adults, holding three toddlers simultaneously is no easy task, let alone for a soon-to-be ten-year-old boy.

However, there was no sign of him straining or struggling while holding them.

"...Impressive, Silver-kun."

Said in slight astonishment was Karen, Thor's wife.

"Even though he looks like a fragile boy... Could it be that he's quite trained?"

That comment came from Sarah, Julius's wife.

Both of them couldn't take their eyes off Silver, who was playfully frolicking with the toddlers.

Shal, who had passed the toddlers onto Silver, didn't seem surprised by this sight. She simply looked envious as she watched them having fun without her.

Well, that's Shal's own doing.

Amidst this, Thor, who had remained calm, muttered quietly.

"...Body enhancement magic."

"Oh, Thor, you've figured it out."

"I have. It's impossible for a boy who hasn't reached ten yet to carry three toddlers without using body enhancement magic. Did you teach him that much already?"

"Well, you know, Silver seems to have a talent for it, or maybe he's learning it from me as I teach him. Teaching him is so much fun."

As I said that, both Thor and Sicily let out sighs.

"Lord Shin... Could it be that you're trying to create a second Lord Shin?"

"Huh? Why?"

"Shin-kun, haven't you realized?"

If Thor's explanation didn't make sense, Sicily spoke to me with a somewhat exasperated look on her face.

"What do you mean?"

"That line, it's exactly the same as what Grandpa Merlin said to you after teaching you magic, isn't it?"

"Huh? Oh..."

Come to think of it... I had a feeling that when I demonstrated magic before enrolling in the High Magic Academy, the old man who pressured me at the time said something like that.

Thor and Sicily must have heard about it from someone. That's why they sighed at my words.

"Is it really true that you're not related by blood? Your words and actions are so similar to Lord Merlin."

"When I see this kind of thing, I realize that children grow up not based on their bloodline but by looking at their parents."

"We should be careful, Lord Sicily."

"Yes, Mr. Thor."

Saying so and nodding, Thor and Sicily both looked at me at the same time.

I get it.

"Okay, I'll try to restrain myself too..."

"Please do."

"Please, really be careful, okay? It's a good thing you're trying so hard, but Silver, in particular, admires you so much, Shin-kun. He'll trust anything you say without question, you know?"

"Got it."

While the kids were happily playing, I was getting a bit of a lecture from Thor and Sicily.

Seeing this, Karen and Sarah were smiling.

"You really haven't changed, have you? I can understand why Thor was looking forward to today."

"Hey! Karen!? Why are you saying that!?"

"Oh, was it a secret? Sorry, Thor."

"No... it's not like it was a big deal or anything..."

"Is that so? That's good."

Upon the unexpected disclosure by his wife, Thor initially protested but quickly backed down because it wasn't something he needed to deny.

Or maybe Karen still calls him "Thor-chan"...

Even though he's her husband and Annabelle's father...

In various ways, an embarrassed Thor blushed and looked down.

"It's all Lord Shin's fault!"

"Why the heck is it my fault!?"

Protesting against Thor's unreasonable blame-shifting, his three wives laughed and the children were left bewildered, not understanding what had just happened.

It's been a while since I've seen Thor, and I realize he hasn't changed, but in front of the children, let's cut it out, seriously...
