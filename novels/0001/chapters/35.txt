The day after the first joint training session, a new joint training was conducted with different combinations from the previous day.

The reason for this was... our fault.

All the knight academy students who were assigned to the same group as us had lost their confidence without exception, and both academies agreed that the training was pointless.

On that day, the knight academy students who were in the same group as us... had complex expressions on their faces.

"Hey, don't you think we're starting to be treated like Shin?"

"Yeah... I've been feeling that since yesterday..."

"Are we being treated the same as Lord Shin...? It's complicated..."

"Isn't everyone being incredibly ruthless!?"

As the knight academy students made ambiguous expressions about being in the same group as us, the magic academy students made similar expressions about being treated the same as me.

Do they really dislike being treated the same way as me!?

Despite such exchanges, the joint training between the knight academy and the magic academy proceeded smoothly.

After the first day, it seemed that the members of the research club also restrained themselves, and the knight academy students were no longer seen feeling down.

And so the training continued, but I wondered how things were going with Strom?

I haven't heard anything about the demons starting to move or anything like that.

Scout teams have infiltrated the former Imperial territory, but there are many monsters, and the details are still unclear.

For now, there has been no invasion of the neighboring countries.

However, it is uncertain what is happening in the former Imperial territory.

Everyone carried an unexplainable sense of anxiety.

"It's good that we have time to spend on training like this, but it's also exhausting to be in a situation where we don't know what's going to happen..."

The joint training is not held every day; there are breaks in between.

Today, training is off, so we were all in the research room.

"Oh, by the way, there has been some progress in the information."

"Eh? Is that so?"

"It's not publicly disclosed information, though."

Not publicly disclosed information?

"Hey... why are you bringing up such a topic?"

"Hmm? Of course, it's to inform you guys."

I knew it! I wish they wouldn't casually talk about national secrets like that!

"Oh, Your Highness? It's not just Shin, but we're here too..."

Maria raised her voice in confusion. It's understandable because what Aug is about to discuss is a matter of national security, and he intends to share it with everyone.

"Yes, he wants everyone to hear it. The members of this research club have become a considerable group of experts. In the future, they will be important forces in case of battles with the demons. Therefore, it's essential to know the movements of the demons."

It seems that everyone is already considered important forces. When they heard this, their expressions became more serious.

"When we hear this kind of talk, it makes us realize that we are a special group."

"Yeah, we're becoming like a special forces unit..."

"We should probably get Shin to teach us more magic."

Maria felt the pressure as Alice showed an unusually serious expression, while Lynn remained unchanged. They had various reactions.

"But there's more to the story."

"New information has come in?"

"Yeah, the scout team that had infiltrated the former Imperial territory recently returned, and they have a report on the demons' movements."

The movements of the demons. Those words, along with the tales of heroes from their childhood, also brought about a sense of dread regarding the threat of the demons to the citizens of the kingdom.

According to Aug, it seems that the demons have been attacking towns and villages within the former Imperial territory.

As a result, the threat has not yet spread beyond the borders. However...

"The situation in the attacked towns and villages seems to be dire. Nobles governing the towns have been killed without exception. Most commoners have also been slaughtered."

Since the opponents are a group of demons, they can't act recklessly. It's impossible to deal with them without forming a coalition of several nations. Thus, they could only watch as the demons attacked towns.

Aug seemed frustrated by this situation.

"Most... which means some people haven't been killed?"

"That's the problem... I don't know the criteria they're using, but it seems that the number of demons increases with each attack."

"So, the people who haven't been killed..."

"They become demons."

Seriously? How much are they multiplying?

"I wonder what Strom is thinking..."

"Who knows? We won't know unless we ask him... but the fact that demons are increasing at this rate is an enormous threat."

Looking at everyone, it was clear that they all had a sense of fear regarding the demons, and they fell silent.

This is, indeed, to further everyone's level up so they don't feel fear!

"Hey, I have a suggestion. Is it okay if I share it?"

"I can't help but feel a bad premonition... What is it?"

"It's nothing strange. We're about to enter a long vacation period, right?"

"That's true."

"How about we use that long vacation for a training camp?"

To this suggestion, Alice was the first to get excited.

"A training camp! Sounds great! When it comes to the research club, it has to be a summer camp with everyone!"

It seems that a summer camp is a regular event on their side as well.

"That's right... If we have to deal with demons in the future, we need to get stronger."

"All-day magic practice... I'm looking forward to it."

Imagining days filled with magic from morning to night, Lynn's voice expressed her delight.

The group, who had been pale from the information about the demons invading the former Imperial territory just moments ago, gradually recovered as they discussed the summer camp.

It seems that they don't know how powerful the demons that Strom is mass-producing are. They had gathered information from afar using enhanced vision magic, but they couldn't grasp the strength of the demons they were using as a benchmark. Compared to the kingdom's monsters, the demons were much more rampant, and the information they gathered was truly life-threatening.

Since they don't know the details of the demons' strength, and in order not to waste the scout team's information, they need to prepare as much as possible for their strength upgrades.

"By the way, where are we going to have this camp?"

Everyone turned to Alice with her casual question.

"Umm, as for magic practice, it's going to be in that wilderness... But since it's a camp, we need a place where everyone can stay. Any suggestions?"

"What? You haven't decided yet?"

"Well, I only recently learned about places other than the deep mountains, you know? I don't know what's good or not."

"In that case, why don't we use someone in the research club's territory?"

"Oh, that's a good idea. Let's see... how about Sicily, Maria, Thor, and Julius?"

"If that's the case, it should be either Sicily or Julius's territory. My place isn't suitable for relaxation after practice."

"Yeah, my place is also in the craftsman's district, so it's not a suitable place for relaxation."

I remember that Sicily's place is in a hot spring town, and Julius's place is a resort area.

A warrior's resort...

"In that case, it's better to avoid Julius's place, right?"

"Eh? Why?"

"In times like these, going to a resort, who knows what people will say to you?"

"I have a headache. This season, many reservations have been canceled."

Oh, it seems that Julius's family business is quite tough.

"We're not doing too bad. We have fewer guests this year than usual."

As expected, during wartime, tourist destinations face significant challenges. It's considered insensitive to enjoy a resort during such times. This seems to be the case everywhere.

"So, can we ask Sicily's territory for practice and relaxation after?"

"Yes! I'd be delighted to be of service!"

"What about the funds? If we all contribute, how much will it be?"

"Huh? It's fine, you can use the houses on my estate."

"No, even if you offer it for free, it's not acceptable. It's not just one or two people, it's this many?"

"No, it's still okay. If you use my mansion, you won't need accommodation expenses, and I can't accept money from friends."

"Sicily..."

"And Shin gave me... us, this amazing equipment for free. Compared to that, this is nothing. Besides, this is an act to save the world from crisis."

"That's true... So, let's take advantage of Sicily's kindness this time, and next time, we can take turns to visit our places, how about that? My place isn't suitable for a relaxing getaway, but we have lots of seafood and local specialties, so you can have fun?"

Maria spoke next, saying that it was their turn, so they decided to accept Sicily's kindness this time.

It's heartwarming to see the unity of the research club in moments like this. Everyone is thinking about what they can do. I should also do what I can.

"Oh, right. Shin, I have a favor to ask, is that okay?"

"What is it?"

Well, my birthday falls during the summer vacation."

"Oh, really?"

"And I'm planning to have the Crown Prince ceremony at that time. I think it will probably be during the training camp. So, I was thinking of having you escort me."

"Oh, sure."

So, I'll be Aug's chauffeur...

No! It's not just something I can do for everyone!

Come to think of it, he mentioned that he would have the Crown Prince ceremony soon. He's already deeply involved in the affairs of the country, so I had forgotten about it.

"So, Your Highness, you're becoming the Crown Prince."

"To be honest, I don't know how it's going to be any different from before..."

"Well, until now, I might have been someone who could become the next king, but now I'm officially the next king in line. Nothing really changes."

"Just a change in title?"

"It's not that simple. From now on, I might have to represent the king in other countries. Besides, not to brag, but I also have to deal with the trouble of Shin-dono's research club. So, please be on your best behavior."

"Thor... Trouble?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. But in reality, we will inevitably be scrutinized by other countries. We have to demonstrate that we have no hostile intentions towards other nations and that we are a beneficial group for the world."

It seems like it's going to be troublesome...

Aug is heavily involved with this research club, so it must be quite a challenge to explain everything.

"Well, I knew this was going to happen, which is why I recommended that Shin start the research club. It's not that big of a hassle."

Prince Choy Choy makes an appearance.

"Besides, I'm a member of the research club myself. I have leverage in negotiations. So, we won't fall behind other countries."

And there it is, Prince Choy Choy's dark side coming through!

"More importantly, everyone, focus on improving your own abilities. Of course, within the bounds of common sense."

"Yes!"

Everyone replied while looking at me.

What's with that?

Feeling a bit puzzled, I returned home and informed Grandpa and Grandma about the upcoming training camp during the long vacation.

"Oh, a training camp?"

"Well, it's not a bad idea. In a situation like this, it's a good opportunity for everyone to improve their abilities."

Grandpa and Grandma also agreed. Now, there's nothing to be mad about!

"By the way, what about the guardians?"

"Guardians?"

"Of course, you know, young men and women of marriageable age sleeping under the same roof. Moreover, there are nobles and even royalty. Even though they are adults, we can't just send the students alone."

Come to think of it, that's true. Especially for Aug, who is royalty. If he goes on a training camp with women other than his fiancée, some people might say unnecessary things.

"The parents of the research club members are probably busy, so I'll go."

"I'll go too."

"Eh? Is that okay?"

"Yeah, we're honestly quite free."

"At this rate, we might get senile."

Grandpa and Grandma, who had too much free time, decided to accompany the training camp.

"Also, you tend to get into trouble when we're not around."

"Well, recently I've been restraining myself... Right?"

"Is that so?"

Grandma stares at me.

"Well... I can't really say anything either."

"You've always been one to lack restraint."

"Hoho..."

Grandpa! Hang in there! Don't sweat and avoid eye contact!

And so, it was decided that we would have a training camp with Grandma's supervision.orm names
