"For the past three years, we have been conducting annual new recruit examinations.

In addition, a few new members have joined, and Van and Minea have graduated from the junior organization to become full members, efficiently handling their daily tasks.

It's a cause for celebration that we've officially started experiencing a shortage of personnel.

The primary reason for this shortage is that Thor and Julius are soon to inherit their noble titles, so they transitioned from full-time to part-time positions.

Og, although not yet the reigning king, has a lot of duties as the crown prince, so he's also part-time now.

Alice got married to Lord Royce, and they had a child this year, so she's currently on maternity leave.

Furthermore, Alice is expected to become the next Lady Marchioness, which comes with various social obligations among the nobility, so she's expected to remain part-time even after returning from maternity leave.

Additionally, Yuri and Maria got married.

Yuri had been in a long-standing relationship with Morgan, while Maria married Cartus, as everyone had expected.

However, Maria and Cartus had quite a few twists and turns in their relationship, so they got married just recently.

Both of them are still active members.

But Yuri got married two years ago and had a child this year, so she's currently on maternity leave.

Sicily and Olivia are pregnant again, and they're due to give birth soon, so they're on maternity leave as well.

As a result, three men are part-time due to family circumstances, while four women are either married, pregnant, on maternity leave, or on hiatus.

Currently, there are only five of us who can immediately respond to requests: me, Tony, Mark, Maria, and Lynn.

Honestly, I'm amazed we're managing to maintain our operations.

Sicily, Olivia, and Yuri will return after their maternity leaves, but for now, they're not active members.

When Van and Minea learned Gate Magic, we all praised them highly.

Now, in this situation, surprisingly, our work is not stagnating.

One of the contributing factors is that we've been conducting annual recruit exams for the Ultimate Magicians.

As a result, the overall level of magic education in various countries' high-level magic academies has improved.

With that, even if someone fails the exam, we have more skilled magicians coming to us, and the number of requests to the Ultimate Magicians has decreased.

Nevertheless, we're still working at full capacity, with no more idle time at the office and the ongoing training of new recruits."

I'm living such a busy daily life, but I still make sure to take my days off.

Today, on my day off, Og has come over to my house.

However, he's not here just for a casual visit.

"...This smells quite fishy," I muttered while reading the documents handed to me by Og.

"Yeah. Things have gotten even more chaotic within the country over the past three years. Honestly, it's questionable if we can even maintain the nation at this point," Og said with a bitter expression.

The topic of our conversation is about Darm. The documents Og brought are the results of internal investigations in Darm.

The results are right in front of me, and to be honest, I'm immediately concerned about the state of the nation.

The documents detail the misconduct of elected officialsâ€”bribery, collusion with businesses, embezzlement, covering up crimes, and so on. It's like a showcase of corrupt politicians.

The initial goal was to eliminate inequality among the citizens by electing representatives from the people, but in the current situation, only a few powerful individuals seem to be benefiting. The taxes imposed on the citizens also seem burdensome, and their dissatisfaction is nearing the point of a riot.

In this situation, Darm's Prime Minister, Mr. Heero, who is the head of the nation, seems to be struggling. He's trying various things, but it appears that he's not making any substantial progress because the lawmakers are not cooperating.

The extreme domestic conditions have caused significant stress, leading to frequent health issues, and Mr. Heero often takes leaves from his official duties. Consequently, it is assumed that the Prime Minister is turning a blind eye to the current situation and not taking any significant actions, which is causing his approval ratings to plummet, to the point of being nearly non-existent.

This is truly outrageous. When I heard that Darm was abolishing the aristocracy and transitioning to full democracy, I was worried. If the citizens originally had grievances against the monarchy and passionately desired political democratization, then it might be justified.

However, from what I could see before, there were very few citizens with grievances against the Darm royal family. Despite that, Darm quickly went from the reckless actions of the new King to the abolition of the monarchy and the swift transition to democracy.

It might have been a good timing to denounce the monarchy, but I can't help feeling that the transition to democracy was rushed.

They removed the nobles who had been involved in politics until then and placed citizens who had no prior political experience into power. It's bound to create distortions.

Nonetheless, the reason we are managing to maintain the nation is solely due to the bureaucrats who work under the politicians. The documents show that they are imposing unreasonable demands on the bureaucrats and even resorting to threats against those who resist.

...This is rotten.

"I've investigated the members of Darm's parliament, but many of them have connections to the underworld or are involved in the underworld themselves. Entrusting the nation's politics to such individuals seems nothing short of madness."

"Yeah, really... What was Prime Minister Heero trying to accomplish?"

"He used to be highly regarded by everyone during the Demon Lord incident, it seems. He was Darm's strongest knight, skilled in both magic and swordplay, and he took over as the successor to the official who went berserk and was killed by the Demon Lord."

"A war hero... It might have looked impressive on the battlefield, but..."

"Politics is an entirely different matter. Nevertheless, he was popular among the citizens, so he became the Prime Minister. However, the methods he used were..."

"Sloppy. Well, no wonder things have turned out like this."

As I observed the dire situation in Darm, on the brink of a riot, I let out a deep sigh.

The reason Og has been investigating Darm is rooted in the Ellie assault incident. He started the investigation with the belief that the mastermind behind Ellie's assault was in Darm. Although he never reached the mastermind, the investigative process exposed him to the situation within Darm's borders.

Appalled by the extreme conditions, he began investigating Darm's internal affairs separately from the Ellie assault incident, thinking it might eventually become a concern for the international community. The result of that investigation is the document in my hands.

Even so, when I visited Darm back when it was still relatively stable, it was a beautiful country with historic structures from the Religion of Creation standing tall.

I never expected it to deteriorate this much in just a few years.

As I sat with the document in my hand, facing Og with a solemn expression, I felt a presence approaching from behind. That presence continued to move towards me and suddenly launched an attack.

"Ugh!?"

I was sitting on a sofa with the backrest hiding my back. The attacker leaped over the backrest and launched the attack on the back of my head.

Startled by the unexpected impact, I involuntarily let out a strange sound.

However, I couldn't avoid that attack.

Because...

"Papa!"

The one launching the attack was none other than my beloved daughter, Charlotte.

At three years old, Charlotte had become so lively that she could easily leap over the sofa's backrest. When I tried to dodge her, she ended up diving face-first into the coffee table, so I decided to accept the attack!

"Oh, hello, Charlotte."

"Uncle Og, hello!"

Since I was sitting across from her, Og, who had seen Charlotte's approach from behind and her subsequent dive, greeted her with a chuckle.

In response, the cheerful Charlotte looked around and tilted her head.

"Uncle, where's Via?"

Charlotte and Via have always been very close, having been together since they were babies. Since Og was here, she must have thought her daughter Via was with him. So, she was looking for Via.

"Sorry, Charlotte. I came today because I had something to discuss with Charlotte's dad. I didn't bring Via with me."

"I see..."

Charlotte seemed disappointed by Og's response.

Seeing her like that, I consoled her by holding her in my arms. Just as I did, we heard footsteps approaching from behind.

"Charlotte, you shouldn't disturb your dad and his friends!"

Saying that, Silver, who had turned six, rushed over.

The grown-up Silver had silky silver hair, a well-defined face, and a slender figure for a six-year-old. Rumor has it that he's quite popular among the girls at the Royal Elementary School, where he started attending this year.

When I heard that from Sicily, I couldn't help but feel proud.

"Hello, Silver, you look well."

"Oh, Uncle Og, hello."

Greeted by Og, Silver politely nodded and gave a greeting.

That polite gesture is truly admirable, Silver!

"Come on, Charlotte, let's go over there."

"Eh? But Papa and the others were talking!"

"Is that so, Dad?"

Ever since Silver started attending elementary school, he began calling me "Dad" instead of "Papa." Well, he's a boy, and I understand that it might be embarrassing to still call me "Papa" at this age, but... it's a bit lonely.

"Well, we've just finished our conversation. Come here, Silver."

"Oh, okay."

"Mom! Mom, come here too!"

Having leaped from my arms, Charlotte called out to Sicily, who had been following Silver from behind.

"Sure, I'll be right there."

Sicily, wearing a wry smile while clutching her swollen belly, walked over to us.

To escort her, I stood up and rushed to her side.

"Are you okay, Sicily?"

"Yes, I'm fine. Thank you."

Sicily, who gently smiled as she spoke, had grown even more beautiful with age. I can't help but be captivated by her no matter how much time passes.

"Papa and Mama are good friends, right?"

"That's right."

As I escorted Sicily, Charlotte and Silver looked at us and made those comments.

"Yep, Papa and Mama are good friends!"

"I want to be friends with Mama too!"

Charlotte shouted and excitedly pounded on the sofa.

"Mom, sit here!"

"Alright, alright."

Sicily said so and sat where Charlotte had indicated.

"And big brother is here!"

"Here?"

"Yeah! And Charlotte is here!"

Saying that, Charlotte sat between Sicily and Silver.

...Huh?

"What about Papa?"

"Papa was good friends a little while ago, so it's fine."

"..."

...Seriously.

In the face of such treatment from my beloved daughter, I couldn't help but slump my shoulders in disappointment.

"Hehe."

"Hehehe."

Seeing me in that state, both Og and Sicily were laughing.

"Sicily..."

"Hehe, Charlotte got along with Papa just a little while ago, so now she wants to get along with Mama and big brother, right?"

"Yes!"

Saying that, Charlotte hugged Sicily.

"Oh, Charlotte, Mommy has a baby in her tummy, so don't hug too tight."

While Silver said this and tried to separate Charlotte from Sicily, Charlotte resisted desperately.

"No! I want to be good friends with everyone too!"

"Hehe, thank you, Silver. But it's okay, let Charlotte do as she pleases."

"If Mommy says so, then it's fine."

Blushing as she received praise from Sicily, Silver reluctantly released his hand from Charlotte's grip. Since he's a boy, he might feel embarrassed when his mom praises him.

"Oh, she moved!"

While watching Silver grow up smoothly as a boy, Charlotte, who had been stroking Sicily's belly, exclaimed loudly.

"Big sister is so happy because you're being a good boy!"

Sicily said as she ruffled Charlotte's hair.

"Big sister..."

Charlotte said and happily giggled, "Hehe."

"That's just like Silver."

"Me?"

"Yeah. When Charlotte was still in Mommy's tummy, Silver was so excited and said, 'I'm going to be a big brother.'"

"That's right."

"Yeah, I don't remember..."

While Og and I were reminiscing about the past Silver, he looked puzzled as he said that.

"Well, Silver was very young back then, so it's natural not to remember."

Saying that, I patted Silver's head, and Sicily also stroked his head.

"But even if Silver doesn't remember, you've always been a great big brother to Charlotte. Mommy is very proud of you, Silver. Right? Charlotte, do you like your big brother?"

"I love him!!"

"Oh!"

Silver, who was suddenly hugged tightly by Charlotte, leaned towards me.

"Whoops."

"Uh, Dad, thanks."

"You're welcome."

Saying that, I picked up both Silver and Charlotte, who was clinging to him, and returned to sit next to Sicily.

"Dad is amazing!"

"Dad, it's embarrassing..."

"Hehe."

Charlotte, who was innocently delighted, and Silver, who was feeling embarrassed being carried by his father as an elementary school student, all made for a heartwarming scene.

Sicily smiled fondly as she watched us.

Ah, I'm so happy.

At that moment, Og, who had been smiling just like Sicily, noticed something.

"Hmm? Shin, what's that pendant hanging around Silver's neck?"

"Huh? Oh, it's a defensive magical item. It's the same one I gave to Ellie a long time ago."

"Oh, that? By the way, Ellie is pregnant again, so she's wearing it now."

Come to think of it, Ellie is pregnant with her second child. She's only about six months along, so her belly is starting to show gradually.

"I see. Is the magical power in the magic stone still okay?"

"I checked just to be sure. There were no issues, but I've already prepared a replacement magic stone, just in case."

Since the trade with Kuanglong started, a large quantity of magic stones has been imported. As a result, the price of magic stones has dropped significantly, and they are now available in the city's workshops.

"I've made a few improvements to it. You can activate it at any time by channeling your own magic into it."

When I said that, Og furrowed his brows.

"Why would you give that to her?"

"Well, it's for practicing magic control."

I said that, and Og stood up from the sofa.

"You!"

He was about to shout, but he noticed that Charlotte and Silver looked surprised with wide eyes. He stopped himself from shouting and moved to the edge of the sofa with his arm wrapped around my neck. During this, Charlotte and Silver were made to sit back on the sofa.

"Do you understand how dangerous that is?"

"Children are prone to magical outbursts, right? Don't worry, I haven't taught her magic control yet."

"But now it's for practicing magic control..."

"It's to get her accustomed to the prerequisite, which is a sense of magic. Magic tools can be used even by those without magical talent. In other words, they react to even a small amount of magic. I'm getting her accustomed to that magic now."

"...To prevent an outburst?"

"Exactly. It's not a great feeling to see Silver continually looked at with suspicion."

In this world, it's different from common sense, but when Silver reaches middle school age, I plan to check whether he has the potential to be a magician and teach him magic control if he does. Silver was born to both parents who are magical beings. So far, there haven't been any signs of him turning into a magical being, but it's still unknown how he'll react when he awakens to magic. If, by any chance, he awakens to magic like me, imitating it without knowing anything, and loses control or causes an outburst... That could lead to self-harm, and who knows what else could happen.

I'm trying to eliminate any such uncertain elements, even if it's just a little.

"Besides, I think the elementary school is safe, but you never know what might happen on the way to and from school. It's better to be prepared for the worst."

"That's true, but..."

Silver is the eldest son of the Walford family.

Currently, I hold multiple titles: Ultimate Magicians' Representative, Walford Trading Company Chairman, Advisor to the Earls Hyde Communications Corporation, and Chairman of the car manufacturer Wollby. I successfully developed automobiles, and while I had initially considered entrusting the project to the Bean Workshop, it was vetoed by my father. Instead, we decided on a joint venture between myself and Bean Workshop. We named the new company "Wollby" after both of our names. Oh, and I also hold the position of Chairman of the Magical Valley Association.

Honestly, I'm fully aware of my importance in Earls Hyde.

That's right, I'm the eldest son of such a prestigious family, and I'm always at risk of being kidnapped. In fact, I've been attacked a few times before. On those occasions, the subordinates of the Ultimate Magicians' organization provided protection as part of their training. They successfully eliminated the threats. However, there's no guarantee that it will always go smoothly, so we need to be prepared.

"I've told Silver not to use magic until I teach him. He's a smart kid. He knows that children might inadvertently use magic and cause magical accidents. You don't need to worry."

"I see... But are you mentally prepared for the worst-case scenario?"

Mentally prepared for the worst-case scenario. It means, if Silver's magic goes out of control and he turns into a magical being, stopping him with my own hands. In other words...

"Yeah, but I won't let it come to that."

I looked at Og with a determined expression.

After gazing into my eyes for a while, Og chuckled.

"If you're that determined, then it's fine. I'm counting on you."

Og patted my shoulder and returned to his seat.

Watching us, Charlotte tilted her head in confusion.

"Are Papa and Uncle friends?"

"..."

Wait a second.

When Charlotte mentions being friends, she means it in a friend-friend way, right? Not some weird kind of friendship like Ellie joked about, right?

"Daddy and Uncle have been friends for a long time, Charlotte."

"Are they like Mom and Dad?"

"No, no!!"

Oh no!

Is Charlotte getting a strange misunderstanding at this age!?

I need to correct this mistake urgently!

After that, Og and I desperately convinced Charlotte, and in the end, she understood that we were as good friends as Charlotte and Via.

Phew... We narrowly avoided a situation that could have sprouted into something unpleasant.

Watching us relieved, Sicily had been smiling all along.

Ah, I thought it would be nice if these peaceful days could continue forever.
