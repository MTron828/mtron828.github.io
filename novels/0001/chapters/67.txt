The day after I returned to the Royal Capital of Arlsheid, I visited a building where a new business venture was about to open.

It was a five-story building, impressively large enough to make you feel its presence. The exterior and interior construction were complete, and they were currently delivering merchandise. The most numerous items were toilets, followed by large refrigerators.

The intention was to install them in the store's restrooms to have people try them out. Additionally, they were in the process of developing a vacuum cleaner that utilized wind magic, but it wasn't yet finished. While they succeeded in suction, they were struggling to effectively separate the collected dust and debris. The development was ongoing, and if it was successful, it would have the potential to dominate the market as there were no magical cleaning tools available before. The product had the most enthusiasm and effort put into it among all the items being developed in the workshop.

They also wanted to develop a washing machine, but the washing, rinsing, and spinning processes were quite complex, and they hadn't come up with a concept for it yet. Should they consider becoming an electronics manufacturer?

Inside the store, in addition to the regular checkout counter, there was a special counter for people with permits to purchase communication devices. By the way, they didn't display Vibrations Swords for sale. During discussions with Lois and Glenn, as well as Sisily's older brother and Alice's father before the store's opening, they were earnestly requested not to sell them. The reason was that the Vibrations Sword's sharpness far exceeded that of existing swords, and if anyone could turn any raw material into a Vibrations Sword, it would lead to mass production and sales, potentially taking over the current market. Furthermore, there was concern that if even low-quality materials could be used, it might lead to a regression in blacksmithing technology. It was a reasonable explanation, and since they didn't particularly want to sell them, they didn't mind.

Instead, they received permission to sell Exchange Swords, which were standard military equipment. Veteran hunters might not be interested, but it was expected that there would be demand among new hunters for a low-cost sword with replaceable blades. It seems that veteran hunters preferred one-of-a-kind forged weapons made by renowned blacksmiths, and they tended to avoid mass-produced or cast products, which wouldn't compete with other weapon and armor stores.

By the way, I seem to be the "Managing Director, Chairman, and Head of Development."

Glenn is the CEO, and Lois is going to be the Managing Director. In addition, they've appointed other positions like Head of Finance, Head of Sales, Head of Public Relations, Head of General Affairs, and Head of Legal Affairs. Glenn and Lois recruited people they know and trust for these positions, and they all readily accepted. It's quite reassuring.

Well, even if they're called department heads, the company hasn't fully launched yet, so aside from the Heads of General Affairs and Sales, there are no subordinates. The Sales Department will also oversee the management of store salespeople, so those salespeople can be considered their subordinates.

By the way, the production of the merchandise is being outsourced to the Bean Workshop, and the General Affairs Department will manage this. They've hired some people from the start to handle order placement, procurement, and delivery of the products.

The Bean Workshop expanded its facilities for the sake of our orders. In the new workshop, they handle everything from production to the magic "enchantment." With this enchantment, they use a "circuit" that's also used in wireless communication devices, allowing them to enchant far more characters than before. This means that workshop personnel can now perform enchantments without needing someone like me, who would have to use abbreviations in kanji characters for enchantments. They've also obtained a patent for this "circuit."

Apparently, Lois strongly argued that they should get a patent since it will surely be imitated in the future. I didn't even know there was a patent system... but they've already obtained a patent for the Exchange Sword.

Honestly, the thought of having to enchant every single product is daunting. I'm glad they developed the circuit. The development of this "circuit" has given them a clear path to mass production, and they're considering expanding the store in the future.

To facilitate this expansion, the company has purchased a five-story building. The first and second floors will be the store, and the third and fourth floors will serve as the company's headquarters.

As for the fifth floor...

"In the future, it'll become the headquarters of the Ultimate Magicians, so everyone's really fired up!"

That's the plan.

In the future, this headquarters will have offices, and they'll station representatives from various countries, taking on requests and delegating work to the members.

The specific operating model will be decided in upcoming ministerial meetings.

"We're almost done with the product delivery, so I'm thinking of opening the store tomorrow or the day after."

"Well, considering that, how about using tomorrow as a day for promotion, and then officially opening the day after at noon?"

"Alright, understood! So, it's settled then!"

With those words, Glenn entered the store. Inside, the salespeople were arranging displays and conducting training, so he likely went to inform them about the promotional activities scheduled for the next day.

Now that the plans were in place, I decided to head to Yuri's inn to inform Naval and the others about the opening date.

"Hello."

"Welcome... Oh! Walfor, what's going on?"

When I arrived at Yuri's family inn, Lind, Yuri's father, and the manager of the inn, was standing behind the counter.

"Are the Els Delegation members here?"

"Yeah, they just left to buy souvenirs from Arlsheid for the family. They mentioned they received a permit to purchase communication devices yesterday, so they must have had some free time."

"I see. Can I leave a message then?"

"I don't mind, but is it something that I can hear?"

"Yes, in fact, it's related to you as well."

"If it's related to me... Could it be?"

"Yes. The Walfor Company will open for business the day after tomorrow at noon."

"Is that so? Finally, we can install that thing in our inn!"

Lind seemed delighted. However, Yuri had used it at our place and knew what it was like, but Lind should be experiencing it for the first time.

"Well, Yuri was talking excitedly about it, which is unusual for her. She was really curious about what it was."

"I see. It's installed in the store's restroom, so it might be a good idea to try it out before purchasing."

"Is that so? Alright, I'll do that."

"Okay, then please deliver the message."

"Understood. I'll visit the store the day after tomorrow."

Now that I've delivered the message to Naval and the others at Yuri's place, it's time to head back.

Two days later, the day finally arrived for the Walfor Company to open.

By the way, I couldn't attend the opening because I had classes at the academy. My grandmother told me to leave money-making to others and focus on being a student, so Glenn and Lois were responsible for running the company entirely.

"I wonder how the company is doing?"

"My father said he'd go shopping as soon as it opens."

"Hehehe. You know, since my dad is the representative of the company, we got it at an employee discount for early access!"

"Huh? Is that true?"

"Living with that toilet at home... I can't live without it anymore!"

Come to think of it, we did offer early access to employees for product explanations. Glenn mentioned that it was quite popular among the employees.

As we discussed this, we arrived at the section where the company was located.

"Hey, was there usually this much foot traffic around here?"

"Well, it's a district with the company, so there's a reasonable amount of foot traffic, but..."

"It wasn't like this."

I didn't remember there being so many people when I came two days ago. Could it be...

With a sense of suspicion, I headed toward the company.

"Is this a line?"

"It certainly seems that way. Could it be...?"

"Ah! It is!"

The line led to the "Walfor Company."

"Ah! Shin, look at this! It's incredibly busy!"

"This is a bit unexpected... And is Lois even involved in crowd control?"

"Haha, the store is quite packed, so the salespeople can't leave."

"I see... Oh, have the Els people arrived?"

"Ah, yes. If they..."

"Hey, Demon Lord! What is this thing?"

As we were talking, Naval from the Els Delegation called out to me.

Even though the store was supposed to open at noon, he was still here.

"Hello, Naval. I thought you had already gone back."

"How could I leave after seeing this? But more importantly, this toilet!"

"Yes?"

"You developed something like this for a toilet?"

"Yes, we replaced our home toilet with this one, and it received great reviews. So we decided to sell it..."

"Wow, that's amazing! A toilet revolution!"

Is it really such an exciting matter? He seems really pumped up.

"By the way, I have a favor to ask... Could our company purchase these toilets in bulk from your company?"

"Oh, Naval! You're trying to get ahead again!"

"Can't you ease up a bit?"

"Early bird gets the worm, you know!"

Another argument started among the members of the Els Delegation. They really go all out when they see something that's likely to sell.

"Indeed, I developed it, but I have no involvement in the sales or wholesale aspects of the business. So, for negotiations, you should speak to our representative, Mr. Glenn, or the Executive Director, Ms. Lois."

"Is Ms. Lois here? If it's okay to name your price, can we purchase these for our company?"

"Please, let us buy them too!"

"Us too!"

"Wait a moment! We can't decide on such a major transaction right here and now! We'll have a discussion with our representative after business hours, so please be patient."

"What time does business close?"

"At 6 PM."

"There are still three more hours!"

"Yes, that's correct, so please wait until then."

The negotiation between Naval and the others and Lois seemed to have been decided somehow. The first day was quite hectic. I hope I didn't burden them too much.

"I'm sorry, Lois. I feel like I've caused you a lot of trouble."

"What are you talking about? I've never been this fulfilled before. I'm enjoying it so much!"

Is that really the case? She looks quite busy, and there's also a negotiation with the Els Delegation after closing.

Will I be able to go home today?

"I've never seen my brother with such a lively expression before..."

...Could it be that he was repressed all this time? If Sisily says so, it must be true.

In the company, not only the Els Delegation but also messengers with permits from Swiede and other neighboring countries were purchasing communication devices at the counter.

Well, even though they are permits, it's just a way to test the devices before general sales. Since the initial distribution was for emergency intergovernmental communication, if the buyer's identity is reliable, the permits are relatively easy to obtain.

General sales are still a bit further down the road. We need to set up exchange stations, and we haven't decided on the form, whether to deploy exchange operators, to have automated exchanges from the beginning, or anything else.

A significant infrastructure development is required, so Mr. Dis said it would become a national project for each country.

First, we'll test it in Arlsheid and then spread it worldwide.

There are more things to do again...

While contemplating the future prospects of communication devices, a salesperson came running in from the store with a pale face.

"Executive Director! We have a problem! The stock of toilets with cleaning functions is completely sold out!"

"What?!"

Could it be that they're sold out?

"Ladies and gentlemen, we deeply apologize. Currently, we have run out of stock for toilets with cleaning functions. We sincerely regret that we cannot deliver any today."

"What? Are you serious?"

"I heard about the reputation from Carlton's Inn and came here to buy one!"

"I used one at the Stone Hearth Inn. It's unbelievable that such an amazing product is being sold to the public, yet we can't buy one!"

"We truly apologize. For those customers willing to wait, we can continue to take reservations here!"

In the end, those who heard that they could still get their hands on the product through reservations started forming a line to place their orders.

"Huh... I didn't expect this."

"Really? I thought that with the widespread reputation of that toilet, it would sell well like this."

"So soon?"

"Carlton's Inn and Stone Hearth Inn, two famous places in the Arlsheid capital, both introduced it, so it spread quickly, didn't it?"

They opened at noon, and this happened in the evening... This will be a burden for Bean Workshop again.

"Your dad will be delighted with this, won't he?"

"Really? Isn't it tough?"

"If you're receiving this many orders, you'll naturally make a profit. Honestly, you're a real asset, Shin."

"I can relate to that! After all, my dad is the CEO! You're quite the catch, Shin-sama!"

Both Mark and Alice praised me. Stop it.

But still, all of this for a toilet? I wonder what will happen when I finish vacuum cleaners or washing machines?

Will there be a queue of ladies at the store?

Or maybe... the husbands will be sent to buy them? There are many strong-willed wives in this country.

"What's going on? There's a huge line!"

"That's true. What's happening?"

"Oh, Shin! Wait a moment!"

The Chief of the Orglund Mage Corps, Chris-chan, and Zig-ni-chan arrived at the company together.

By the way, Mr. Orgland said he'd purchase it after hearing Mr. Dis's praise, and Zig-ni-chan and Chris-chan have been using that toilet at their place. They probably finished their work for the day and came to buy it.

"I heard it was sold out earlier."

"W-What?!"

"I-Is it too late?"

Zig-ni-chan and Chris-chan knelt down in despair. Orgland looks disappointed but not as devastated.

"You guys... Isn't it a bit too dramatic over a toilet? It's not a limited quantity sale; you can just buy it when the next batch arrives."

"The Chief hasn't used that toilet, so he can't understand! Once you use it, there's no turning back... I've been looking forward to having one at home since yesterday."

"Is it really that good?"

Orgland is a little distant from the passionately speaking Zig-ni-chan and the deeply dejected Chris-chan.

But both of them look a bit pitiful.

"Zig-ni-chan, Chris-chan, hold on a moment."

"What is it?"

"What's wrong?"

"This."

I take out a spare toilet with cleaning functions from my storage space where others can't see.

"Hey, you, what's this?"

"It's our spare. I'm giving it to Zig-ni-chan and Chris-chan."

Zig-ni-chan initially looked pleased by that offer.

"No, no! How could I, your junior, accept your generosity? As your senior, I should endure this... but it's just that..."

He was struggling with his pride again.

"Thank you. You truly are amazing, Shin. I'm so happy. But I can't accept it for free. I'll pay for it."

"What's wrong with you? Why are you so readily accepting it?"

"Why wouldn't I? My dear younger brother prepared it for his big sister, out of kindness. Is there something wrong with accepting a kind gesture? Are you an idiot?"

"What did you say? Hey!"

"What's going on here?"

They started again. I'll leave them to it.

"Orgland, please take one too."

"Hey, is this really okay? There are so many people waiting in line over there."

"Well, let's say it's a privilege for knowing the developer."

"I see. If that's the case, I won't refuse."

"Wait a minute! Chief, what are you doing?"

"Shut up. Shin said he'd sell it to me. It'd be rude to decline."

"Argh! Shin, what about me?"

Oh, he ended up giving in after all.

"I said I'd give it to you from the start. Here you go."

"Wow... now... that toilet will be in my house..."

"Really, you don't have anything left to be stubborn about compared to Shin, not to mention magical skills and wealth. And you have such a cute fiancée."

"Oh... well..."

"Your fiancée is cute, indeed. Shishirī, you can call me 'big sister' too, you know?"

"Big sister?"

"Why not? You should be used to calling me that by now, but this ticklish feeling..."

Is it because you're calling her "big sister"?

Chris-neechan, who was petting Shishirī's head, suddenly blushed and created a peculiar atmosphere.

Hey! She's mine!

"To make such a cute girl your fiancée... you're quite different from Shin, who flirts with anyone."

"Mind your own business!"

"What happened to your dignity? Oh, speaking of which, the only place you have dignity left is in your age."

Chris-neechan laughs mischievously, but that line...

"Do you know, that line is a boomerang, right?"

"I will kill you."

"You're the one who started it!"

"What's wrong? What's wrong?"

Do as you like.

By the way, on this day, there were twice as many reservations as the planned sales of toilets with cleaning functions for the entire first day.
