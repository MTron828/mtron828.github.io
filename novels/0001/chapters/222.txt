Inside that building, there were numerous shelves, and on top of them, there were remnants of something.

This is...

"Could this have been some kind of shop?" Sicily muttered as she surveyed the interior of the building.

As Sicily suggested, this was undoubtedly a store.

Furthermore, this is...

I confirmed it by picking up the remnants placed on the shelves.

This place is an electronics store!

Or more precisely, a magic tool store?

At first glance, it was filled with things that I couldn't understand their use, but I was certain about the vibe. It seemed like they were meant for displaying something, and there were counter-like setups as well.

The remnants I picked up earlier, which I couldn't identify, might be some sort of communication device. The communication device I knew... in other words, a smartphone, had a significantly different form.

Speaking of communication devices, during my time, smartphones were the mainstream, but if there were many engineers who remembered their past lives and developed spatial displays or something similar, it wouldn't be surprising.

Maybe it's a communication device that uses such technology.

Well, personally, I have my doubts about it. Individual communication devices are a manifestation of privacy. If it were a spatial display, wouldn't it be a massive privacy leak? Perhaps they've applied some kind of processing to make it invisible to others.

While contemplating such things, I answered Sicily's question while surveying the interior of the store.

"Well, I guess it's probably a magic tool shop?"

When I said that, Sicily glanced around the store once more.

"A magic tool shop?"

Sicily didn't seem to grasp it.

Well, that's understandable.

After all, it has probably been several hundred to over a thousand years since the collapse of the previous civilization. Cars were mostly made of metal, so they survived to some extent, but materials other than metal, such as seats, have mostly deteriorated, and only the metal parts have remained.

"There are many things with shapes that are hard to understand, so I thought it might be magic tools."

I said, and Sicily looked puzzled.

"Can't you figure it out, Shin-kun?"

"I have no idea."

Moreover, a considerable number of engineers would be required to create such ruins.

You need a significant number of engineers for something like a communication device.

Even if you can establish communication, you still need content to create. That's the kind of world it is, where technology would have been advancing rapidly.

In my previous life, there were countless times when I blinked and said, "Huh? When did this happen?" regarding various tools. Considering that, it wouldn't be surprising if unrecognizable tools without their original forms were being used for unexpected purposes.

I was just stating the obvious, but...

"Well, it was surprising to learn that there are things even Shin-kun doesn't know."

"No, no, I can't possibly know everything."

I wonder what Sicily thinks of me?

It's not like I know everything. Well, I do know something...

"Because it's something created by people who built a civilization like this. It's unimaginable."

"I see."

When I said that, Sicily looked somewhat relieved.

...What's that?

Could it be that she thought I would gain inspiration from the magic tools here?

"Now, there doesn't seem to be anything useful here. Shall we move on?"

"Yes."

Sicily and I exited the building together.

There, we encountered Mark, Olivia, and Yuri.

"Hey, Wolfort-kun. What was that building? Did you find something interesting in there?"

Olivia, who seemed tired compared to the lively Mark and Yuri, had already been looking around.

"Oh, it seemed like a magic tool store..."

"A magic tool store!?"

"Yeah, but there wasn't anything... useful, so we left."

While we were still in the middle of our conversation, Mark and Yuri rushed into the building.

Looking at the left-behind Olivia, I chuckled.

"Both of them were looking for this shop. So, they couldn't resist, it seems."

"I see. But it's quite an old ruin, you know? There was nothing with its original form left..."

"Yeah..."

Olivia sighed and headed towards the store.

"I'll accompany you for now. You two can go on without worrying."

"Yeah, that's right. Keep an eye on the two of them so they don't go out of control."

When I said that, Olivia and Sicily stopped in their tracks, eyes wide open.

Huh? What's going on?

"Wolfort-kun saying something like that is surprising..."

"Shin-kun, are you okay? Do you have a fever or something?"

"Wait a second!"

Why is Olivia so surprised that I'm saying this?

And Sicily too!

"Well... I have some sense after all, so don't make such surprised faces, both of you."

So don't look so surprised, both of you.

"This is an ancient ruin from another country, so I know we shouldn't damage it or take things without permission. That's why I went to get permission to take that thing earlier, remember?"

"Oh, that's right."

Sicily seemed to remember the earlier incident.

"Um... That thing?"

Olivia, who wasn't there earlier, asked anxiously.

And for some reason, Sicily answered.

"Olivia-san, I'm sorry. It seems like Shin-kun came up with something again..."

"Huh? Huh?"

"I think we might be causing you trouble again when we get back, so I apologize in advance."

"Huh? Oh... another situation where Mark has to get involved..."

"Yes, I think it might be a hassle for Mark-san and everyone in the workshop. I'm really sorry."

Sicily said and lowered her head.

This is starting to sound like a conversation between wives.

Perhaps Olivia thought the same thing because she blushed and started fidgeting.

"Um, well, about Mark's time being taken up, I have no involvement with the workshop!"

Huh?

Wait a minute.

"Isn't Olivia (san) married to Bean's workshop?"

"Not yet!"

Oh, I see. They haven't had the wedding yet.

"But in Bean's workshop, isn't it already treated that way?"

Groans

"So, it's not a problem if I tell the people at the workshop about it, right?"

Sicily tilted her head as she said this, and Olivia let out a sigh as if she had given up.

"Ugh... I understand. I'll tell the people in the workshop..."

"Thank you. I'll go and greet them when I get back."

"Okay."

After saying that, Olivia walked off into the store where the two were left behind.

"I completely forgot, didn't I? Mark-san and Olivia-san haven't gotten married yet."

"Me too. They always seem like a married couple, so I didn't feel any awkwardness treating her as a wife."

"Right."

Our perception is like that, yet the individuals themselves get embarrassed when referred to as a wife.

Why is that?

"Why do they get so embarrassed?"

"Hehe, I kind of understand."

"Is that so?"

"Yes. Until we have the wedding ceremony and become an official couple, being called a wife feels a bit embarrassing."

"I see."

"Yeah. After the wedding ceremony, it becomes the opposite, and we feel happy."

"Ah, I understand that."

Before our wedding, it was embarrassing when Sicily was called my wife, but after we got married, it felt like an acknowledgment, and I was happy.

Olivia is probably in a similar situation now.

"By the way, this sudden trip to Quanrong, are Mark and the others prepared for the wedding?"

"We've already finished most of the preparations."

"Come to think of it, all the women were involved in the preparations, right?"

"Most of it was taken care of by the country when we got married. Ellie and I only had to choose our dresses. This time, we can prepare for the wedding ourselves, so it's enjoyable."

Olivia's dress is also apparently handmade by everyone.

Not only Sicily but also Maria, Yuri, Alice, and Lynn have all been to Olivia's house to help with the preparations.

It was impressive to see everyone having fun with the preparations.

Mark, on the other hand, didn't do anything.

Male preparations are pretty much done once they have their formal attire ready.

Looking at this, I once again think that weddings are primarily for women.

As for the wedding location, it seems they're planning to hold it in the church that oversees the area since Mark's house and Olivia's house are adjacent to each other. After that, they've reserved Olivia's family-owned Stone Oven Inn for the reception.

...This is what a commoner's wedding is like, right?

Well, I have some fond memories of it, even though I couldn't have a ceremony blessed by the Great God Church's Pope at the Aelstrod Grand Cathedral. Sicily seemed happy too.

"Since Olivia-san will be a newlywed soon, don't make things too difficult for Mark-san, okay?"

"...Am I going to be the cause of family discord?"

"That's right. We're not students anymore, so please restrain yourself there too, okay?"

I see, so I can't just say, "Let's go have fun like students." It's a bit sad, but I guess that's what it means to have a family. In my previous life, I never got married, so I have no experience in that regard. I need to learn and remember.

"Ellie-san is also graduating from the academy and will start accompanying His Highness on official duties as the Crown Princess, so it's a bit sad that we won't be able to meet like we used to."

It seems that changes in relationships after graduation aren't limited to us men. Ellie married Aug and became the Crown Princess, but she was still a student in terms of status. So she didn't appear in public much and spent a lot of time with the female members of the Ultimate Magicians. However, after graduating from the academy, she will be more actively involved in her role as the Crown Princess. Come to think of it, in my previous life, things changed each time I graduated from school. It's been seventeen years since I was reincarnated into this world. I had completely forgotten that feeling. It was only three years, but my student life at the Advanced Magic Academy was so much fun.

"It's a bit sad, but this is what it means to become an adult."

Sicily might have been reminiscing about her enjoyable time at the academy, as she muttered with a somewhat melancholic expression.

Well, it's certainly sad, but...

"We'll be fine."

"Huh?"

Sicily looked puzzled at my words.

"Because even after graduation, we'll all be working at the same place, and besides, I think you, Olivia, and Ellie will have new connections from now on."

"New connections?"

Sicily seemed to be at a loss for words and tilted her head.

But from my perspective, I think this connection here will last a lifetime.

"Yeah, mommy friends."

"M-Mommy...!"

Sicily blushed at my words.

"It's not like we have to have children just because we're married. But Ellie and Olivia, especially, want to have children, and I think they themselves want that, right?"

"That's right. Both of them have that expectation due to their positions, but they also personally want it."

As the Crown Princess and future Queen, Ellie has a duty to have children.

Olivia also hopes to give birth to an heir for the Bean Workshop in place of Mark.

And Sicily, though she hasn't experienced childbirth, is an experienced parent to Silver, whom she has been raising since he was a baby.

I think we'll continue to have various connections in the future.

"Yes, mommy friends... mommy friends, huh..."

So far, among our group of women, Sicily is the only one with children. While she has a grandmother who is experienced in child-rearing, she doesn't have friends she can casually call "mommy friends." There are other mothers she meets at the park, but Sicily is known as the Holy Woman. The other mothers are friendly, but there's a sense of unfamiliarity. It's considered disrespectful to be friends with the Holy Woman. So, her mommy friends are likely to be Ellie and Olivia, who share a similar status. Sicily seemed happy, with a smile on her face, probably imagining the scene of the three of them chatting about child-rearing.

"It sounds like a lot of fun."

Sicily said with a beaming smile.

"Yeah, it does. But I'll also make sure to actively participate in raising our child, okay?"

"Hehe. Yes, I'm looking forward to it, Papa."

Sicily said so and embraced my arm. Perhaps it was because I had just been thinking about the possibility of having treated past children inhumanely, but I wanted to ensure the happiness and well-being of Silver and the children to come.

Oh, come to think of it...

"I wonder who will be the first?"

"Huh?"

Sicily had a puzzled look on her face at my words.

Oops, I forgot the subject.

"No, I meant, who will be the first to have a child?"

"!!"

As soon as I said that, Sicily's face turned bright red.

"Bringing a child into the world is a gift, so there's no point in competing for it."

"R-right..."

After saying that, Sicily hugged my arm tightly.

"Uhm..."

"Yeah?"

"When this is over..."

"..."

With her face flushed and her eyes glistening, Sicily stared at me.

In that moment, I held my breath.

And then, determined, Sicily spoke.

"Uhm... I want... a baby."

"!!"

Her appearance and words pierced straight through my heart.

"Eek!"

I couldn't resist and embraced Sicily.

"When we get home, let's do it right away."

"Shin-kun..."

Our feelings for each other were on the verge of exploding.

Naturally, our faces drew closer...

"Hey..."

"?!?!?"

Suddenly, we were interrupted, and Sicily and I jumped in surprise.

"Are you planning to cause an international incident by engaging in such activities behind the scenes of a foreign relic?"

The one who spoke was Aug, who had a quiet tone but visibly pulsing veins on his forehead. At his side, Shaolin covered her face with both hands, her face beet red, peeking at us through her fingers.

Wait... how long had they been watching?

"Seriously, the moment we look away for a bit, you two find new ways to get into trouble."

"Uh, well... It's usually best to do those things in a room where no one can see."

Aug said with exasperation. Shaolin, blushing crimson, offered her opinion, sounding like the very picture of seriousness.

"What's going on, you two? Did you need some excitement?"

"Feeling bored?"

Alice and Lynn had somehow joined us.

"Outdoors...?! Such advanced technology..."

Hey, Maria.

That's not what I meant by advanced technology.

"Besides, don't jump to weird conclusions! There's no way we'd do something like that here!"

I said, and Aug squinted.

"Oh? By the way, what were you talking about earlier?"

"Huh? Um, who would be the first to have a child... and that we want a baby..."

"...After discussing that, you two passionately embraced... right?"

..."

From talking about wanting a baby to passionately embracing each other... what's next?

"Sorry..."

"S-Sorry..."

Sicily had a surprised expression, and I couldn't come up with an explanation to reverse this situation.

"Please deny it properly! Otherwise, I..."

Trying to clear up the misunderstanding, Sicily said, then, after a deep breath, shouted:

"You're going to become the kind of perverts who do it outdoors!!"

Silence fell over everyone.

"...Huh?!"

In the silence of everyone, Sicily finally understood what she had said.

"N-No!!"

"Oh...!"

She seemed so embarrassed that she rushed into my chest, burying her face. It was clear she couldn't look at our surroundings.

"Good grief... It's fine to have a good relationship, but you should still maintain some decorum."

"No, we weren't trying to do anything weird."

"Well, never mind. More importantly, I'm thinking it's about time we leave the ruins. Is there any more you want to see?"

Thankfully, Aug changed the subject himself, so I went along with it.

"I'd like to see more, but there's no end to it. If we want to see more, we can always come back."

"I see. Then, let's head back."

We contacted everyone via the radio communicator, and we decided to conclude our exploration of the ruins. While we could use the gate to return, it was recommended not to use it too conspicuously since the research team was present, so we decided to walk back.

During the journey, Sicily couldn't lift her face from my arm, remaining silent the whole time. As I gently stroked her head to comfort her in this state, I contemplated the children who would be born in the future.

At that moment, I completely failed to notice Aug staring intently at me.
