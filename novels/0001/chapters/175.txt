After the women came out of the bath, we followed and entered the bath as well.

We usually enter the bath noisily, but considering what lies ahead, our mood was heavy.

When we entered the bath and crossed paths with the women, Leafan-san talked to Shaolin-san about what happened earlier, and it was decided that we would continue the conversation after the bath.

When Shaolin-san heard Leafan-san's words, she seemed a little surprised, then looked at me with a determined expression.

I couldn't hear what they were saying at that time, so it must have been Kwanglun's language.

So, I don't even know what they conveyed.

Sigh... I wonder what they will ask me.

Maybe Leafan-san is also a reincarnated person, and I'll be accused of cheating or being unfair for using words from a past life?

It's depressing, but there's no use just lazing around in the bath forever.

I made up my mind and got out of the bath.

After getting out of the bath, I, Aug, and Leafan-san called for Shaolin-san.

Then, others followed us in a crowd, wondering what was going on.

Sisily is among them.

"Huh? Where's Silver?"

"He's already asleep. More importantly, I heard that Shaolin-san and Leafan-san have something to talk to Shin-kun about."

"Shaolin-san?"

"Oh, I, I'm sorry... I was questioned about my conversation with Leafan, and I blurted out that there's something I want to confirm with Lord Shin."

"I see."

"I'm curious about what they're talking about... Shouldn't we listen too?"

Sigh... Seriously?

Huh? Is it going to be a situation where I have to confess in front of everyone?

What should I do...

Thinking that, when I looked at Leafan-san, she said without changing her expression while crossing her arms.

"I don't mind. If possible, I'd like to hear everyone's opinions too."

No way out.

This is a situation where I have to talk about my past life memories in front of everyone.

Sigh... What will happen if I talk about it...

Will everyone look at me with suspicion?

...I don't like this.

Separate from my own thoughts, the conversation continued, and eventually, not only the girls but also the boys gathered to listen to Shaolin-san and the others.

We gathered in a tent for men.

I temporarily stored the beds that had been set up in a separate space and sat in a circle.

By the way, just in case, I also had Silver's bed transported into this tent.

Then, after everyone had taken their seats, Shaolin-san began to speak.

"I apologize for taking up your time, Lord Shin. There is something we must confirm."

"...Is it about the characters?"

"Yes, that's correct. I'll get straight to the point. Lord Shin, I heard that those characters are your original, is that correct?"

"Yes."

In response to Shaolin-san's question, as a last-ditch effort, I lied.

"I see... However, there is something that doesn't quite add up."

"Doesn't add up?"

Augg reacted to Shaolin-san's words.

"Yes, that's right. The reason being, the characters Lord Shin used..."

At that point, Shaolin-san paused for a moment and looked at me.

"...We've seen them before."

"What!?"

I couldn't help but exclaim along with everyone else.

Huh? Do they have Chinese characters in this world?

"Wait, wasn't that supposed to be your original?"

"Well, it was, but... it wasn't used in any of the books."

"Then why..."

"Yes, that's the question."

As Augg was about to press further, Shaolin-san took over.

Why I knew characters that weren't even recorded in books.

I was getting confused now.

Could such a coincidence really happen?

This planet isn't Earth. That's confirmed by the different constellations.

Different constellations mean that even if it were the same universe, the coordinates would be different.

Certainly, the ecosystem on this planet bears a strong resemblance to Earth.

Maybe planets where humans can live undergo a similar evolutionary process.

But what about their culture?

Even on Earth, languages and scripts differ from one region to another.

So, how could the characters be the same if the constellations are different?

In my state of confusion, Shaolin-san continued to speak.

"The characters Lord Shin used are no longer in use. They are what we call ancient language."

"No longer in use?"

"Yes, and while we recognize them as characters, their meanings have not been deciphered."

So, they are Chinese characters.

I only had that impression, but Augg felt differently.

"What?! They haven't been deciphered!?"

"Hey, Augg, what's gotten into you?"

"Are you asking what's gotten into me? Listen up. In our country, even though they are no longer in use, we have something called archaic language because we know the meanings of words, right?"

"Oh, that. Honestly, does it even make sense to teach that in class?"

"That's not what I'm talking about. Even though it's no longer in use, we can still understand what's written. Do you know why?"

"Well, because the language didn't change suddenly, so gradually, we can still understand the meanings of the old words."

"That's right. But the fact that they haven't been deciphered..."

"Ah..."

I see.

"The history is not connected. In other words..."

Augg said this and looked at Shaolin-san with a shocked expression.

"Yes. Today, during the conversation you had inside the airship, it was about the possibility of a previous civilization existing before our civilization."

"No way..."

Augg muttered in astonishment at Shaolin-san's words.

"Previous civilization... Could it really have existed?"

All the team members were surprised by that statement.

Never did we imagine that what we discussed earlier today, which we thought was just gossip, could be true.

"In our country, sometimes very old relics are excavated. They are clearly from an era older than our known history. And within such relics..."

"No need to say it. In other words, the characters that Shin used were written."

"That's correct."

This is truly shocking.

I never thought it could be such a story.

It's a story filled with historical romance, you could say.

But...

"Hey, Augg, I get that there might have been a mysterious civilization, but why do you look so serious about it?"

"Have you forgotten today's conversation?"

"Today's conversation?"

"...It was about this desert."

"The desert..."

"They said something about a previous civilization and the aftermath of a war."

"Previous civilization?"

"They say they were able to create advanced magical tools. The result of these magical tools led to the downfall of the previous civilization and the creation of this desert region."

"Ah."

"You finally get it?"

"Y-Yeah."

The reason Shaolin-san had such a serious expression was...

"The previous civilization possessed highly advanced technology for creating magical tools. This has already been confirmed."

"Confirmed?"

"Take a look at this."

Shaolin-san said this and pulled something out of her pocket.

It was...

"...!"

I almost exclaimed loudly, but managed to hold it in.

Because it was undeniably a gun.

"This is a weapon. A year-long journey. There were situations that Leafan alone couldn't handle. However, thanks to this, I was able to escape from danger. Come with me."

Saying that, Shaolin-san got up and left the tent.

The guards on night duty, seeing us, looked our way.

"This is how it's used."

Without worrying about any of that, Shaolin-san aimed the gun at a nearby rock and pulled the trigger.

A laser-like beam shot out from the gun barrel, piercing through the rock.

Not only the guards but also everyone else was stunned by this sight.

"This way, you can attack enemies. And this is..."

"...Recovered from the ruins..."

"That's right. Of course, these excavated items from the ruins are valuable, but they're relatively common. At least common enough for me to acquire."

In other words, this was a mass-produced item.

Which means...

From a national perspective, it's only natural, right? Weapons even more powerful than this...

Saying this, Shaolin-san looked around.

"...so powerful that it caused this desert to come into existence."

...

The silence was painful.

"So, let's get back to the original topic. Characters that you used were found in the ruins. And probably, these same characters are also used in this magical tool."

Saying this, Shaolin-san stared at me.

Ah, at this point, I understand what she wants to say.

"In other words, you're saying that I might be able to create those weapons, right?"

"Yes. I'm truly sorry for discussing something completely unrelated to the original request, but now that we know, we absolutely must confirm. Lord Shin, can you..."

Shaolin-san hesitated for a moment, considering whether to say it or not, but in the end, she spoke.

"Can you create a weapon powerful enough to destroy this world?"

Shaolin-san's words were incredibly serious.
