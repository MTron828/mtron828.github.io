"Wow...? No way..."

All eyes turned towards the elderly man who had suddenly appeared.

In those gazes, there was a mixture of disbelief and a wish for it to be true.

"Heh, my apologies for the sudden intrusion."

"You're in the way."

He acted as if he had just dropped by a neighborhood store.

There was no sense of urgency, as if a demon was approaching nearby.

There was no one else who could maintain such an attitude at a time like this.

"Ah... You are..."

"Me? I'm Merlin. Merlin=Walford."

"I'm Merida=Bowen."

In response to the question from a nearby soldier, the old men introduced themselves with the names everyone had hoped for.

"Sage..."

"Sage..."

"Even the High Priest..."

The names started to spread among the disheartened reserve troops.

And then...

"Wooooo!! Sage! High Priest!"

Cheers erupted.

"S-Sage! Why... Why are you here in this place?"

The commander of the reserve troops rushed over to Merlin and asked why he was here.

"Well, it just so happened that I was at the royal castle when I heard that the demon that Shin failed to capture had appeared here."

"My grandchild's mistakes are our mistakes. We'll take responsibility for it."

"Oh... Oh, thank the gods."

The commander thanked the gods for the fortunate coincidence of having them in the royal castle.

"But more importantly, look. The demon is getting closer. Can you move away?"

"You'll get caught up in this. Evacuate quickly!"

"Yes, sir! All units, evacuate! Do not obstruct the Sage and High Priest!"

With the living legends before them, they willingly cleared a path for the two without any hesitation.

Merlin and Merida, followed by a large number of soldiers, took their positions at the front.

"Is that the demon over there?"

"Just as Shin said. It's incomparable to that guy."

They showed no sign of pressure as the demon came closer within their line of sight.

"Really, what are those kids doing? They have means of communication, but they're still so slow."

"Well, that can be discussed after this is over. But for now..."

Merlin, focusing on the demon, said...

"Shall we give it a warm welcome?"

"Not...!? This fire... Gwaaaah!"

"Y-You're just like them... Gaaaah!"

"You... you guys!"

Unable to completely deflect the superheated fire projectile unleashed by Merlin, the two demon-like creatures were directly hit.

Suffering heavy damage and near death, they were further assaulted.

"This will finish you!"

A fiery tornado, a firestorm, suddenly erupted.

While it wasn't the same blue-white flame, this firestorm rapidly grew in size, consuming the nearly lifeless demons with superheated, swirling flames.

When Merlin dispelled the magic, what remained were the charred corpses of the demons.

"Ah... ah... aaah..."

Instantly defeated.

The surviving demon's mind flashed back to the moment when Shin and his group had effortlessly taken them down.

There was no mistake. This was their master, the one they should have avoided facing in battle, the head honcho.

"U... uwaah!"

Driven by fear, the demon tried to flee from the scene.

However...

"Do you think we'll let you escape?"

A wall of flames blocked the demon's path.

"Guh! It's hot!"

The intense heat made the demon hesitate to break through the wall.

And that hesitation proved fatal.

"This is the end!"

The same blue-white flame as before, now in the form of a spear rather than a bullet, thrust at the demon.

"Damn it! Damn it all!"

Pierced by multiple fiery spears, the demon collapsed on the spot, burning out in silence.

With this, the demons who had plotted attacks on various countries were completely wiped out.

Merlin, who had overwhelmingly dominated the battle and vanquished the demons without any difficulty, received a casual remark from Merida.

"As always, it's just fire magic. You have no variety, do you?"

"Merida, is that your attitude toward someone who has defeated demons?"

"Hmph! Defeating such weaklings doesn't deserve bragging rights."

"That's true. Look, we're done here!"

While they conversed in an atmosphere that seemed indifferent to having just defeated a human threat, Merlin addressed the soldiers who had been watching in awe.

The soldiers, who had witnessed Merlin's legendary combat for the first time, gradually regained their composure and, eventually...

"Wooooo!! Sage! High Priest!"

A loud cheer erupted.

Amidst such a boisterous celebration, a certain voice caught Merlin's attention.

"Grandpa!!"

The remnant demons were defeated by the old man who had appeared at the reserve troops' location.

The old man used his signature fire magic.

Moreover, it was the same blue-white flame that I use.

As expected of the old man. He never forgets to continuously improve himself.

He also overwhelmingly dominated the battle against the demons.

Those who were likely witnessing the old man's battle for the first time were stunned by the spectacle.

"As expected of Shin's grandfather..."

"Yes. He was once known as the Crimson Sorcerer in the past. His fire magic is formidable."

"The Crimson Sorcerer?"

Although Maria and Aug were impressed, Aug seemed to be curious about something.

"What, don't you know? Before Merlin-sama was known as the Sage, he was a skilled mage known as the Crimson Sorcerer, specializing in fire magic."

"Is that so? Why do you know all this?"

"It's in Merlin-sama's 'Heroic Tale.'"

Everyone nodded at Aug's words.

I see... I didn't know because I was embarrassed to read about my family's heroic tales.

But, more importantly, I need to go to where the old man and grandma are.

I flew over the reserve troops and called out to the old man and grandma.

"Grandpa!!"

"Hmm? Oh, Shin."

"What are you doing coming here now?! What about you?!"

"Whoa! Sorry, grandma!"

I got scolded by her as soon as I spoke.

Of course, I deserved it since I put everyone in danger.

"Wait a minute, Lord Merida. Shin did a good job. They escaped because someone rushed ahead at the scene..."

"Your Highness, circumstances like that on-site are hard for the common people to understand. They'll only focus on the fact that the demons escaped. That's what matters to the public."

"..."

Certainly. Those who were on-site will probably see it as inevitable.

However, to people who didn't know the situation at the scene... they would likely prioritize the one who let the demons escape and put themselves in danger...

"But there are also issues with how we handled things after letting them escape. Did anyone contact Arlsheid?"

"Oh..."

I was so preoccupied with chasing the demons that I forgot to make the call...

It was Sieg and the others who had contacted Arlsheid, not us.

"You probably didn't encounter Arlsheid's forces on the way. Didn't you find it strange?"

"I was so focused on chasing the demons... I didn't feel anything was amiss."

"Your Highness, within this team, you play the role of a commander. Someone in that position should remain calm."

"I... I apologize."

If I had noticed the oddity of not encountering Arlsheid's forces along the way, we could have found Arlsheid's army, listened to their side of the story, and learned the precise direction the demons had fled. This would have allowed us to provide support and eliminate the threat before arriving here.

"Some of you could have used the gate to get ahead to Arlsheid. This way, the information could have reached Arlsheid's forces via the capital, and they could have been on alert."

"Oh... I see..."

I assumed we couldn't make contact because we hadn't been given a radio communicator.

That's right. Arlsheid had the capability to communicate with us, so they could have initiated contact.

...I just never thought of it.

"Shin, what happened to that radio communicator?"

"Well, it's still a prototype, and it didn't have enough channels..."

"Wasn't it supposed to allow communication with all team members? Why didn't you hand it over?"

"That was... I thought there might be sensitive information or something..."

"I see... confidential conversations within the team?"

Grandma sighed heavily at my explanation.

"You fool!! Because of your priority on those confidential talks, do you realize the chaos that ensued?!"

She scolded me fiercely.

"This experience should serve as a valuable lesson. Neglecting communication can lead to a loss of composure and the consequences of such actions. Everyone should remember this!"

"Yes, ma'am!"

Sigh... We had successfully defeated the demons, but the final mistake made it feel like we had undone all that. However, everything grandma said was absolutely correct.

The cause of our errors was the panic due to the irregular situation, which led to numerous hasty misjudgments.

First of all, encountering the demons on the way was irregular. In hindsight, we should have surrounded the town from the beginning.

If I had gone to meet Alice and the others and returned through the gate, we could have saved time, and there might not have been anyone rushing ahead.

Looking back, it's nothing but things to reflect on...

"Merida, that's enough of that. These kids are still around fifteen or sixteen. They're allowed to make mistakes."

With the help of Grandpa's intervention, Grandma's scolding finally came to an end.

"But Merida's words make sense. Everyone, from now on, we need to be more diligent in communication and reporting, right?"

"Yes..."

"Indeed. Youngsters learn and grow from their mistakes. Things have gone too smoothly for you so far. Fortunately, no harm came from letting the demons escape. Consider this a valuable lesson and think of it as a good opportunity to learn."

"Yes!"

Report and communication... They used to say that a lot before...

Since I was born in this world, I was completely ignorant because everything related to reporting and communication had always been handled by those around me.

No matter how strong my magical abilities become, they're meaningless if I can't use them effectively.

This incident gave me a big lesson just when I was getting a little conceited.

"So, is this the end now?"

"Huh? Uh, well... I'm not sure."

To Grandma's question, I, who didn't know what would happen next, looked at Aug.

"Although this isn't the end of all the demons, the demons who were planning the attack have been completely eradicated."

"So, does that mean there are still demons left?"

"Yes. The ringleader believed to have turned them into demons, Oliver Strom, is still alive."

"So it's not over yet?"

"That's...?"

"Is something wrong?"

Aug told Grandpa and Grandma about what he heard from the demon in the town.

"Hmm... Strom had the goal of destroying the Empire, and he said he would be satisfied once he achieved that."

"The demons certainly said that."

"I see..."

Grandpa and Grandma started pondering something.

I wonder what's going on. Did something come to mind?

"...Did Strom have some kind of grudge against the Empire?"

"It's hard to say... but the fact that he wanted to destroy the Empire might suggest that."

"Hmm..."

Grandma crossed her arms and furrowed her brow in thought.

Then she began to share her own answer.

"Perhaps... it's possible that his strong hatred towards the Empire led to his transformation into a demon."

"Demon transformation?"

"Yes. We couldn't say for sure before, but if Strom's reason for becoming a demon is that, then a certain hypothesis makes sense."

With those words, Grandma looked at all of us.

"To become a demon, it might require more than just a surge of magical power. It's possible that a strong hatred or resentment, combined with the unleashed magical power, can trigger the transformation."

She put forth a hypothesis about demon transformation.

"...I see, so Strom turned the Empire's commoners into demons because..."

"Commoners in the Empire are the ones most oppressed, and it's not surprising that they harbor strong resentment and hatred towards the Empire."

So that's why demons kept increasing every time they attacked the town.

The Empire's commoners were the primary targets of exploitation. They would likely hold deep grudges against the nobles and the Empire itself.

He exploited that sentiment to gain more allies.

"But if Strom became a demon out of intense hatred for the Empire, how does he feel now that he's achieved his goal?"

"...Does he have nothing left to do?"

"Probably."

So that's why Strom didn't show himself.

However, the commoners who had been oppressed until now were now motivated by their newfound strength. This partly explained why the demons had started to turn against each other.

Gradually, the picture of the situation was coming into focus.

"In that case, is everything resolved if we avoid provoking Strom?"

"...I hope it goes that smoothly, but..."

Grandma responded to Aug's hopeful speculation with a slightly uncertain tone.

Well, it's a demon they're dealing with.

Strom had mentioned that his values had changed since becoming a demon, so there was some uncertainty.

But for now, there's no need to provoke something that's not showing aggression.

There's no need to needlessly expose everyone to danger.

"As for Strom, we'll think about him later. For now, I'll report to the Alliance that we've defeated all the demons."

"I see. We'll head back to Earlsheid as well."

"Very well. Until next time."

Saying this, Grandpa was about to open the gate.

I had a question that bothered me, so I asked Grandma.

"Grandma, about the demon transformation theory you mentioned earlier... did you arrive at that theory for some specific reason? Do you know something about the demons we faced in the past?"

In response to my question, both Grandpa and Grandma briefly wore somber expressions.

"Shin."

"Yes, Grandpa?"

"That's something we'll discuss later..."

Saying this, Grandpa and Grandma passed through the gate and left.

They must know something about it.

But... it might touch on a dark part of their past.

Otherwise, they wouldn't have reacted that way.

They said we'd talk about it later, but maybe it's not something I should pry into...

"Shin, dear."

"Hmm?"

Although they're family, I might have been impolite...

Thinking this, I was approached by Sicily.

"It's alright. You're not the type to talk about things that shouldn't be talked about, and I'm sure what you're going to hear will be fine."

"Is that so?"

"Yes."

I see.

Since they said they would discuss it later, it should be okay.

"Thank you, Sicily."

"Hehe, you're welcome."

My spirits lifted. I had been scolded, been a bit impolite, and my mood had been down.

"All right! Let's go meet up with the Alliance and make our report!"

And so, we opened a gate to the town where the demons had gathered.

After returning to the royal capital from the plains, Merida whispered her unspoken concerns to Merlin, words intended for his ears only.

"What if those who have lost their goals... can't find any value in everything in this world..."

Merida imagined an undesirable future.

"I hope that doesn't come true..."

Merlin watched her with a complex expression as she muttered this.

When we returned to the city where the demons had gathered via the gate, there was no longer an Alliance army present. They must have started moving towards the Imperial Capital.

We used floating magic to chase after the Alliance army in the direction of the Imperial Capital and soon caught up with them. What we saw was the sight of the combined forces of Earlsheid and the Alliance army ambushing and subjugating a horde of monsters.

"What's going on here? How did this situation come about?"

"Oh, Shin!"

Puzzled by the strange sight of them ambushing the monster horde, I was called out to by Sieg.

I deactivated my floating magic and descended to the ground, heading over to where Sieg was.

"What happened to the demons?"

"You guys, you encountered the demons?"

"That's right. You guys didn't notice you lost track of the demons?"

"No, we noticed right away and gave chase, but it seems like we were heading in the wrong direction..."

"So you didn't catch up with the demons after that? But more importantly, if you noticed right away, you could have contacted us via Earlsheid. The demons appeared so suddenly that we were taken by surprise."

We had inconvenienced Sieg and the Earlsheid forces due to our lack of communication.

Honestly... even though we're mages, losing our composure? Wasn't the blue of our magic academy uniform supposed to be the blue of composure?

"I'm sorry..."

"Listen, Shin. In strategic operations, the importance of communication cannot be stressed enough."

"Um... yeah. I already got scolded by Grandma."

"I see... you got scolded by Lady Merida... well, I guess giving you another lecture would be too much."

Sieg seemed like he was about to say something about the importance of communication, but when I mentioned getting scolded by Grandma, he gave me a sympathetic look.

Sieg seems to be scared of Grandma too.

"So, what happened to the demons?"

"Grandpa took care of them. But Sieg, what's this situation?"

"Merlin-sama took care of them!? How about your situation? I wanted to see it!"

"Never mind that, what's the situation?"

"R-Right. Actually, after you guys passed us, we tried to catch up with the Alliance army. However, we ran into a horde of monsters along the way. It turned into a battle, and that's when the Alliance army joined us."

I see...

It turned into an ambush by chance.

"There's no need to bother you guys, so just watch."

"I see. So there are Catastrophe-class creatures here?"

"Well, yeah, there is. Look, that huge bear."

"Huh? There's a Catastrophe-class creature, and you're okay with...?"

"Never mind that, just watch."

Sieg told me this, and I gazed upon the Catastrophe-class bear. As expected, it was significantly larger than the regular ones. The mages from the Mage Corps unleashed their magic on the Catastrophe-class bear.

While the damage wasn't significant, the bear's attention shifted toward the Mage Corps.

"Look up!"

Upon those words, I looked up above the bear.

"Whooooaaa!!"

A familiar female knight descended.

"Huh? Whaaat!?"

Why is a knight coming down from the sky? And, furthermore, isn't that...

"You came up with that, right? The 'Jump Thrust'."

"Come on, Miranda... I told you that was just a playful move!"

Miranda knows about it... Why? And why is she using it in a real battle?

"No way, Miranda... I told her that it was just a playful move."

So, Maria was the one who spilled the beans to Miranda!

Miranda descended from the sky and, using the hilt of her sword as a foothold, thrust it into the bear's neck. How can she make such an accurate attack with that? Furthermore, she continued by removing the hilt, using her jet boots to drive the sword deep into the bear. She's using it so skillfully! Hey!

With that one blow, the Catastrophe-class bear slowly fell and ceased moving.

Upon closer inspection, it wasn't just Miranda; soldiers were jumping and leaping around everywhere.

We were left dumbfounded by this scene.

"What is this? The Mage Corps can cast magic without chanting, but a flying knight division..."

"Well, it's because they are using tools developed by Shin. Their way of thinking has become more like Shin's."

"Am I not related to this in any way?"

Maria's blunt response and Og's rude comment were adding up. Why do people become more like me when they use my tools?

"I understand that! When I'm around Shin, everyone's thinking becomes more like Shin's!"

"That's right! Everyone ends up like that! It's not just me, right?"

For some reason, Alice vehemently agreed, but Sieg was the one who seemed the most desperate.

Why are you all so enthusiastic about this?

"I mentioned it to her because Sieg's actions on the way were similar to something you'd do. Then she seemed to be in shock."

"Oh, Chris-nee-chan. I mean, in shock...?"

I'm the one who's in shock here!

"Well, I sort of understand."

"Even Chris-nee-chan!?"

What a cruel brother and sister!

"Not in a weird way, but... Shin's way of thinking is rational, efficient... easy to emulate."

I thought they were using my actions as examples of perverted behavior...

"The actions Sieg took and the way the knights attacked from above with their swords are efficient, aren't they? Since these aren't things most people would think of, they say it's like Shin."

"I-I see..."

I don't know what actions Sieg took, but it's true that attacking from above with force is efficient in terms of dealing damage.

It's a mixed feeling...

Soon, the annihilation of the monster horde was completed, and we reported on the results of the pursuit of the demons.

"The escaped demons were defeated by Sage Merlin and Mentor Merida near the Arsheid border! As a result, all the demons planning to attack various countries have been annihilated!!"

At that announcement from Og, the entire alliance army erupted in thunderous cheers.

With the addition of the Arsheid army, it was a massive force of over a hundred thousand.

The cheers from such a force were overwhelming.

"However, there are still demons remaining, but it's believed that they have no intention of invading. After this, we will conduct a sweep of the demons within the demon territory while aiming to conclude the situation through negotiations between the countries. Everyone, one last push!"

Another round of cheers erupted.

With this, our group, the Ultimate Magicians, and the Arsheid students were relieved of duty.

The demons were gone, and there were probably still Catastrophe-class creatures left, but we had learned the Jump Thrust from Arsheid. Also, the United Sweed Coalition had offered to lend us magic tools created by Yuri.

It was fervently argued that with those, monster extermination would become more efficient. When we demonstrated it for representatives from different countries, there was a series of offers to borrow the tools.

In addition to the Jump Thrust, they decided that we would be fine even without us.

It was also mentioned that they couldn't keep relying on students like us. They seemed to want to protect their own peace by themselves.

It seems that the students have had enough of their battlefield experiences.

By the way, I thought about creating and providing attack-type magical tools, but everyone stopped me. The reason was that if I used my attack-type magical tools, the land where humans could live would disappear. But I haven't even made them yet, and I haven't mentioned what kind of magical tools they are. Can I cry now?

As a lesson learned from the confusion caused by not providing the wireless communication devices, they decided to provide each country with wireless communication devices that had open channels only. As soon as they are created, they will be handed over to the intelligence agencies of each country for real-time information exchange and efficient monster extermination in the demon territory.

The commander of Elz seemed to be pushing for negotiations as if it were an imminent matter, but other soldiers from Elz held him back.

I need to work on improving the wireless communication devices when I get back to Arsheid.

The final goal of the United Forces is to exterminate a certain number of monsters in all regions except the former imperial capital.

The demon territory is about the size of Germany in the previous world. It's impossible to wipe out all the monsters in that entire country.

After that, each country will hold further discussions on how to treat and deal with Strohme. There is no room for us students to be involved in that.

And so, our mission has come to an end, and the subsequent monster extermination operation is entrusted to the soldiers of the United Forces. We returned to Arsheid.

"It's over, isn't it?"

Strohme received the report that all the renegade demons had been eliminated and muttered in disappointment.

The tone of her voice didn't seem to express regret over the fact that her peers had been wiped out, despite the fact that they were her former comrades. It was more like she was disappointed that her entertainment had come to an end.

"Even though I tried to help a little..."

The attendant who overheard this thought to himself, "Was it an experiment?" but didn't voice his thoughts.

"Strohme-sama, what would you like to do from now on?"

Zest, who was standing by her side, asked Strohme about her future plans.

For some reason, Milia, who was usually present in this place, was absent.

"Well... What should I do next?"

Strohme mumbled with an uninterested look. with concepts
