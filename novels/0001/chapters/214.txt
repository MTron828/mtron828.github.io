"Thus, diplomatic relations were established between Quanlong, Earlsheid, and Els.

As for the rest of the Western world countries, there will be another meeting at a later date.

With this, our first job as the Ultimate Magicians' organization is completed.

...Or so I thought.

'After that, we just need to create the official documents and sign them, right?'

'The document creation will take a few days since we have to write them in each other's country's languages to avoid any discrepancies.'

'Agreed. So, do we just wait during that time?'

'Yes, that's how it will be. So, may we ask you to stay for a while longer?'

'No problem. Then, please contact the Min family again.'

'Understood.'

I see... Our job includes Suiran's treatment and the protection of Naval and others, after all. This means I'll be staying with Quanlong for a while longer.

Even though I thought it was over...

"Well, let's go back to the Min family and start negotiations on this side."

"True. We've been holding back from negotiating before any trade agreements were made, as it might cause friction, but for us, this is more important."

Ah, right. We had promised an exclusive contract for trading with Suiran and the magic stones.

It's amazing how negotiations can change so much depending on whether you have information or not.

Neither of us mentioned any information about the magic stones during the trade agreement negotiations.

As a result, the trade for the magic stones, which seems to be of the utmost importance to the Western world, won't have any tariffs or the like.

Well, we don't know what will happen in the future, but for now, it seems that the Western world has the upper hand regarding magic stones.

So, we found ourselves staying in Quanlong for a few more days, but this time, we really have nothing to do.

Probably, Shaolin will be called to Yuhuang Palace for document creation, and then Liefan will be the interpreter for the negotiations with Suiran about the magic stones.

It might be the other way around, though.

Either way, if we don't have both interpreters by our side, we can't casually explore the city.

And we don't have any money.

"What should we do starting tomorrow..."

As I was pondering how to pass the time, an unexpected suggestion came from an unlikely source.

"May I have a moment, Your Highness?"

"What is it, Freid?"

"While Your Highness and Mr. Naval are negotiating with Suiran, could we go and explore the ruins?"

Oh?

"Ruins?"

"Yes. I mentioned it on the airship when we were coming here, but I'm quite fond of mysterious stories about ancient civilizations and such."

"Come to think of it, you did mention that."

"And so, I've been itching to investigate, especially now that it seems that the so-called ancient civilization, which was previously considered mere gossip, actually exists."

"Is that so..."

That's the thing I was thinking of asking Shaolin about. But I wasn't sure how to bring it up because if I expressed a desire to investigate the ruins, I might be met with strange looks. Tony's suggestion would probably not raise any suspicion from Shaolin.

Nice one, Tony!

"Lord Shaolin, do we need any permission to enter the ruins?"

"No, permission is not required to enter. However, as I mentioned regarding Hao, if any weapons are found, there is an obligation to report it to the country. So, the presence of an investigator is always necessary."

"What about during Hao's time?"

"He was, despite appearances, the top bureaucrat in this country... Ignoring or covering up such matters was a common occurrence."

Hao's despicable nature even beyond his death. It's actually quite impressive.

"Where do we request the investigator?"

"There is an office for the Ruin Exploration Team at the entrance to the ruins, and you can request it there."

"I see. Thank you."

"You're welcome."

"That's the situation. Ideally, I'd like to go as well, but these negotiations are crucial. Make sure not to cause any trouble, all right?"

When Oug said that, Alice and Lin responded with delight.

"We understand!"

"No problem."

"You're the ones we're most worried about..."

Such exchanges were made, and everyone was laughing, and then Shaolin joined the conversation.

"I'm sorry, may I also accompany you?"

"You too, Lord Shaolin? But what about the document creation at Yuhuang Palace?"

"There will be coordination and confirmation with various departments, and I don't think it will be completed right away. Until the documents written in the country's language are finished, I won't have any work. So, can I accompany you until then?"

When Shaolin said that, I glanced at Tony instinctively.

"It's not a problem at all. If Shaolin comes with us, we can also ask her to be our interpreter."

"I'm fine with it too!"

"No problem."

Following Tony, Alice and Lin also agreed.

Since Tony, who had made the suggestion, had consented, there was no reason to refuse Shaolin's accompaniment. I looked at the faces of the others, but no one seemed to object in particular.

We've been together for quite a long time. It seems like everyone trusts Shaolin. I wanted to oppose her accompanying us because I wanted to quietly remove any dangerous weapons I might find, but if I were the only one against it while everyone else agreed, it would be too conspicuous. So, reluctantly, I also agreed to Shaolin's accompaniment.

"Shaolin, please take care of us again starting tomorrow."

When I said that, Shaolin replied with a cheerful expression, "Yes, I'll do my best."

But still...

What if we come across something really dangerous?
