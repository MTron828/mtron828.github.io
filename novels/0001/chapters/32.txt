after asking me three questions

A demon tiger appeared.

After we defeated it, everyone was amazed.

...Well, at least it didn't leave us traumatized like Professor Alfred or Chris, right?

"You guys, remember, this is abnormal for Shin, so don't use it as a reference. Catastrophic monsters like tigers and lions can only be defeated by our military with a determination to risk their lives. Don't misunderstand this scene and think 'demon tigers are weak.'"

"Yes!"

What, even the instructor from another group is responding.

"Shin's way of defeating it is too incredible to be a reference."

I even got scolded by Sissily.

"I see... not a good reference, huh."

"But, Shin being in the training is reassuring. If something happens, Shin is there. So, I think everyone can do intense training."

"Isn't that Zeke and Chris's job, though?"

"Oh, right."

Sissily is supporting me. She's kind-hearted after all. I wish that kindness could be directed only at me, but... Sissily is naturally kind, so it's probably impossible.

"Alright, there was a small mishap, but we still have some time left until the scheduled time. Let's continue the training a bit more."

After separating from the other group, Zeke declared that. A catastrophic monster appeared, but everyone only observed, so it should be possible to continue.

They were saying it's depressing that we haven't actually fought.

"S-Sissily? Can we stay with you..."

"Y-Yes, of course. We'll protect you."

"No, I'm fine. Besides... if we talk about safety, there's no place safer than Shin's side."

Sissily said that and smiled at me.

That was quite a straightforward statement. Klaus and the others seem quite down.

"We appreciate your intention to protect us, but honestly, it doesn't benefit either of us. We came here for training. We don't want to be protected all the time."

It's about what happened last time. I think they were very concerned about causing me trouble during that incident. They probably want to be able to protect themselves.

"Alright! Sissily, you want to become stronger, right?"

"Yes! I want to be able to protect myself!"

"Oh, did everyone notice? So, what kind of monster do you think it is, Your Highness?"

"I think... a bear?"

"Oh! Correct, Your Highness. My, my, the little Your Highness who was so small has grown so splendid..."

"...Quiet, there's no way I'd still be a child who plays with you forever."

Og was being teased by Zeke.

This is a rare sight.

"Zeke-niichan."

"Hm? What is it?"

"Tell me about Og's childhood later."

"Sure, I can do that."

"Hey! Stop that!"

Og is in a big rush. I'm looking forward to what happens after the training, hehe...

"Even though there's a bear monster, why are you talking about that? You guys!"

"Hmm? Well, it's just a bear, right? Shin defeated one when he was ten."

"Even if Shin is on support duty, it's still a bear! Have a bit more tension!"

Zeke is getting scolded again.

"You too, Shin!"

"Me!?"

"You were quite involved, you know..."

Huh? Where's Sissily's support?

Everyone is giving me and Zeke a disapproving look.

"Cough! Well, you see, we're just trying to ease everyone's tension."

"Yeah, that's right! I'm also offering support! Let's take it easy, okay?"

"Well... while it's certainly a valuable experience to have a large monster hunt with Shin on support duty, maybe you should be a bit more serious."

"Okay."

"Ugh! Who are you to lecture us?"

"What? Did you say something?"

"Hey? Chris too!"

Chris snaps out of it with that one comment.

"Now then, we will begin the hunt for the bear monster. First, as usual, we'll use magic, and the students from the Knight Academy will deliver the final blow. Be flexible and adapt to the situation. Especially you students from the Knight Academy, since you can't cast magic while sticking to the monster, keep a close eye on the situation and fight accordingly."

"Yes!"

Chris forcefully changed the topic and conveyed the precautions for this hunt.

The bear is a little further ahead, so everyone advances together.

And then, they spotted a bear eating a regular deer between the trees.

"Are you ready? Then, start with magic... Fire!"

At Chris's command, the three of them simultaneously cast their magic.

I fired "Fire Arrows," "Wind Blades," and "Stone Bullets" to ensure the effects didn't overlap.

The magic hit the bear, causing it to writhe in pain.

Is this the result of the research society? Everyone's magic power has increased.

"...Alright! Knight Academy students, go!"

"Yes, ma'am!"

For a moment, Chris was surprised by everyone's magic, but she quickly gave a new command, and Klaus and the others charged at the bear.

"Did you guys... use such magic?"

"Well, we thought that if we used our magic to its full extent, we might defeat it in one blow..."

"Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the Knight Academy students' training?"

"Shin instructed us. He said not to go all out against medium-sized creatures."

"Well, it was the first time I used magic against a monster, but it was a good thing to follow Shin's instructions."

"Yes, we didn't expect the power to increase so much..."

Seeing everyone's progress in the research society, I thought that we might be able to take down medium-sized creatures with a single blow, so I advised them not to go all out.

Otherwise, there would be no role for the Knight Academy students. I'll say it again; this is training.

While we were talking, Klaus and the others were closing in on the bear monster.

They couldn't defeat it in one blow yet, but the damage was steadily accumulating.

Klaus and the others must have been confident of victory because they prepared to deliver the final blow.

However, wild animals are most dangerous when they are wounded. If they are on the brink of being killed by a monster, they will try to make a desperate last attack.

The bear monster caught Klaus's sword that was about to strike it with its left arm.

The sword got stuck in the arm and couldn't be pulled out. Then, the free right arm attacked Klaus.

"Danger!"

Chris shouted, but I had anticipated this situation and had prepared two Wind Bullets. I fired one to deflect the right arm that was coming down, and the other hit the left arm where Klaus's sword was stuck.

Klaus couldn't move his left arm anymore, so he pulled out his sword and swung it more cautiously this time.

Finally, Klaus and the others defeated the bear and returned to us.

"...Walforde... Thank you..."

"Yeah, you're welcome."

Ugh... They thanked me so begrudgingly.

"Klaus! Noin and Kent, calm down already! If it weren't for Walford, you'd be dead! Can't you see... I'm embarrassed for you all!!"

Whoa, Miranda finally lost her temper.

Well, that's understandable. Despite having a girl like herself around, Klaus and the others only paid attention to Sissily, got upset when she rejected their protection, and on top of that, they couldn't even thank me properly for my support.

I bet they've never seen them act like this before. It seems like she's quite disillusioned with them.

"Calm down, Miranda."

"But, Lady Christina!"

"They usually go to an all-boys academy. Besides, the girls from the Knight Academy... including me, we don't really act all girly, do we?"

"Well... I suppose..."

"My former classmates were like that too. They'd always talk about girls... even though there were girls right there! Am I... not a woman?!"

"C-Christina?"

...Christina's dark side is showing...

I see, Christina also wasn't popular during her academy days. She must have worked hard after graduation...

"Teenage boys are like that. They want to look good in front of cute, protectable girls. Most likely, they're jealous that Shin takes all the attention."

Wow... Christina is really venting... She must have received quite the treatment from male students during her time at the Knight Academy.

Klaus and the others turned beet red and hung their heads. Stop it already!

...Come to think of it, Zeke has been strangely quiet. I wonder what's going on with him?

Thinking that, I looked at Zeke...

"Is this for real...? Magic power higher than mine? Shin? Is he teaching you? Can I learn too? But... I've treated that guy like a little brother until now. If I were to learn from him, it would hurt my pride... Wait, he's Merlin-sama's grandson. If I think of it as indirectly learning from Merlin-sama... But still..."

He's wrestling with his pride over here.
