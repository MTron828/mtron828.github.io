In front of us, there stretches a clear blue sea and endless white sandy beach.

The sea, illuminated by the summer sun, opens up our hearts.

"Wow, the sea!"

"Why are you stating the obvious?"

After completing a two-day journey, we arrived at the Rittenheim territory.

Rittenheim territory is characterized by white buildings and has a distinct resort feel.

There are no samurai residences.

Upon arrival, we first went to the Lord's Mansion to pay our respects.

Greeting us at the Lord's Mansion was Marco von Rittenheim, the Count of Rittenheim, a massive man surpassing Julius, with a muscular body.

"Oh! It's been a while, Your Highness Augustus. How do you do?"

"Yes, it's been a while, Count Rittenheim. I'll be quite busy from now on, so I'd like to take it easy before that."

"I understand your situation. Please relax as you wish."

"Yes, I appreciate it."

"Sages and clergy members, welcome to our home as well. It's an honor for the people of the Kingdom of Alside to receive you."

"Well, thank you. We appreciate your hospitality."

"We'll be relying on you. Also, Your Excellency, there's no need for nobles like you to bow to commoners."

"Well, I understand that, but... I've heard that if you two hadn't refused, you would have become nobles a long time ago..."

"Huh? Is that so?"

I heard that for the first time.

"Nobility is just a hassle."

"We've been told that story many times by Uncle Diasuum, but we're not interested in being nobles."

Certainly, from the stories of Uncle Dias and Cecil, it seems like being one of the top nobles in the Kingdom of Alside involves a lot of hard work. It's not suitable for an old man and woman who want to retire in the forest.

"Shin, please make yourself at home."

"Oh, yes. Thank you."

I had come to greet them before the training camp, so we were already acquainted. The count, with a warm smile, said this.

"You are a dear friend to Julius, so I want to treat you with care."

"Father, you're embarrassing me..."

Julius inherited his way of speaking from his father. Is this the way the Rittenheim family has spoken for generations?

Despite his appearance resembling an American professional wrestler...

After finishing our greetings with Count Rittenheim, we were guided to the hotel where we would be staying this time.

The culprits are definitely them!

"Is it okay, August?"

"Well, it's not like I'm showing off my naked body. It shouldn't be a problem. Besides..."

"Besides?"

"I'm just relieved that I didn't have to go shopping with Ellie. You shouldn't have any complaints."

I muttered quietly.

"What's wrong?"

"Oh, it's nothing."

Even so... it feels like we've figured out the murder weapon.

"Oh, you look great, Ellie!"

"There's no mistaking the choice. Perfect."

Alice and Lynn appeared together.

Alice wore a blue and white two-tone separate swimsuit.

Lynn wore a black one-piece.

"You guys... you went for the safe options..."

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"Disappointed. This suits us the best."

"Yeah, it's a children's swimsuit!"

Saying that, the two of them began to look dejected.

I've never seen such a sad self-destruct...

"Oh, everyone!"

Yuri appeared and said that.

She ran towards us wearing a black bikini.

She was originally a girl with a good figure, so when she ran in a bikini...

"You rascals! Flaunting it like that!"

"Yuri, you too!"

"Yaa!"

The two little kids became her prey.

But it was quite a sight.

Vavavoom...

"Shin, your mustache is twitching."

I was startled by Maria's sudden comment and turned around.

"Oh? Oh, that's the swimsuit you bought with Grandma, right?"

"Yes. Isn't it cute?"

She was wearing a green separate swimsuit with a pareo wrapped around her waist.

Depending on how you look at it, it suits her well.

"It's great. It looks good on you."

"I wish my boyfriend would say that..."

She's cute, though.

"Oh, uh..."

"Hmm? Oh, there's Sicily. She's here..."

The moment I saw Sicily, who had finally arrived, another bolt of lightning struck my head.

Wearing a white bikini, Sicily looked at us shyly, and I was left speechless.

"Hey! Stop staring and say something!"

I was finally brought back to my senses when Grandma tapped me on the back.

"Um... well... uh, it looks really good... and cute..."

"Eh... Oh, thank you... Shin, your... outfit looks cool too."

"Oh, thanks..."

"No, it's..."

What is this? It's so embarrassing!

"Shin, how about mine?"

"Hmm? Looks good, right?"

Seeing Grandma in a swimsuit, something in me cooled down. Grandma does have a surprisingly good figure for someone in her seventies, but seeing a family member in a swimsuit...

"It's really amazing, Merida-sama. If I imagined my grandmother dressing like this..."

"If it were us, the whole family would stop her! Only Merida-sama can pull it off!"

"Wow... Merida-sama is amazing!"

Everyone praised Grandma's swimsuit appearance.

In her blue one-piece swimsuit, if you only looked at her body, she didn't look like an elderly person at all. She's like a beauty in her prime... but Maria and Alice said it too, didn't they? If it's a family member, they would stop her with all their might! I feel exactly the same way! It's too scary to say it, though!

"Oh, everyone's here."

"Sorry for being late."

Finally, Mark and Olivia arrived together.

"What...?"

"A hidden ambush in a place like this..."

So Alice and Lynn muttered, and there was Olivia, surprising everyone by wearing a pale blue bikini swimsuit.

"Darn it! She's the type who looks slimmer in a bikini!"

"Completely caught off guard. The damage is severe."

Alice and Lynn have been acting strangely since a while ago.

Did they get shown reality so clearly that they broke?

By the way, all the guys are here too, but they're all in swim trunks, and I don't plan to describe their swimwear in detail.

By the way, Julius isn't wearing a loincloth.

Samurai...

"By the way, is everyone okay with their families?"

"Yes, we were told to go and play on our own."

"Same for my family!"

It seemed the same for the others, and everyone seems to be resting in their cottages.

Unlike our two, the others aren't as close to their family members.

"Now that we're all here, what should we do?"

"When you come to the beach, you swim, right?"

"Shin, you grew up in the mountains, right? Can you swim?"

"Even in the mountains, there are rivers and lakes, you know."

So I can swim somewhat.

Of course, I used to swim not for fun but for hunting.

"Alright then... Charge!"

"Yay!"

Alice and Mei-chan were the first to jump into the sea.

"Well, then, should we also go into the sea? What about you, Shin?"

"Yeah... Sicily, want to come with me?"

"Yes, I'll go!"

We were about to head to the sea, but Lynn wasn't moving.

"What's wrong, Lynn?"

"I just remembered a big problem."

"A big problem?"

"I can't swim."

"..."

Huh? You forgot until just now?

"I was focused on picking Ellie's swimsuit."

"Jeez... you two..."

When Alice and Lynn get together, they become quite cocky. But leaving Lynn alone would be unfair.

"Okay, you can use this."

"What's this?"

"It's a float."

I took out a float from my extra-dimensional storage, but... huh? Everyone is looking puzzled. Could it be that there are no floats here, even though there's a culture of swimming in the sea?

"How do you use this?"

"Well, Lynn, put your body through this ring like this."

"Like this?"

"And then try going into the sea."

"Oh, I'm floating!"

"It's a tool for people who can't swim..."

As I said that and looked at everyone, they had astonished expressions.

"This is... this is revolutionary..."

"Until now, people who couldn't swim couldn't enter the sea..."

"With this, anyone, even small children, can go into the sea."

"Um... could I also borrow one? I'm not very good at swimming..."

At Ellie's request, I brought out another float.

This one was made from the leather of a monster rabbit, which repelled water and was lightweight. It didn't have much strength, so it wasn't suitable for armor, but it was perfect for a float.

"Um... Shin, I also..."

"Sorry, Sicily, there are only two floats."

"Oh... I see..."

I wonder if Sicily is also not good at swimming? She was going to go with us, so she must be able to swim to some extent.

"In exchange, I have something like this."

"Huh? Wow! A boat?"

Yes, it's a boat made from the same material as the float.

"Sicily, come here. Want to try riding on this?"

"Yes, whoa... whoa! It feels so nice!"

It sways gently with the waves, and it's close to the surface of the sea, so it must feel nice.

"Then, I'll join too."

"Ah, ahh!"

"Oops! Are you okay?"

"Y-Yes... I'm fine."

The boat rocked when I got on it, causing Sicily to fall. Now that we were both in swimsuits, our bare skin came into close contact...

"Shin, it's warm..."

"Sicily, too..."

We felt closer to each other...

"Hey! Get a move on! The lovebirds are here!"

"Whoa!"

"Squeal!"

Maria scolded us, and we were hit by a wind magic. It was a gust of wind, so we weren't hurt, but the boat was swept away.

"Don't be reckless!"

"We've been swept quite far."

"Well, we can move using magic, and it's not a problem to be out at sea."

"Magic? Is it wind magic?"

"Even without magic, we can move, but this way, it's faster."

Saying that, I put my hand in the sea and created a water jet.

"Wow! It's fast! Amazing!"

"Right?"

"But why can you use this magic?"

"It's convenient for fishing in the lake."

"You were fishing for fish too?"

"Eating only meat gets boring. Want to try?"

Saying that, I took out a fishing rod and reel made from a bamboo-like tree that grew in the forest. Tom uncle had bought the reel for me in this world.

"But we don't have bait..."

"There's something like this."

I took out a homemade lure and set it on the line.

"Shall we give it a try?"

"Yes! This is my first time fishing."

Saying that, we started fishing, but...

"Wow! I got another one!"

"Whoa! Me too!"

Instead of enjoying fishing with laughter, the two of us were more like fishing than fishing, and it felt more like catching fish by the handful.

You might think we should stop, but once we came this far, I thought I'd catch enough fish for everyone's dinner... and that's how it ended up.

We caught enough fish for everyone who came with us to have their fill, and stored them in the extra-dimensional storage.

"It's gotten a bit fishy here."

"Yeah."

"Should we go into the sea to wash off the smell?"

"Ah... um, well, the thing is, I'm not very good at swimming, so... could you help me?"

"Sure, then... here, come."

"Yes!"

I took on this task rather lightly, but my thinking was naive.

Now that we were both in swimsuits...

"S-Shin, make sure to hold me properly, okay?"

"Y-Yeah, it's okay..."

Ideally, I should have carried Sicily from behind, but she was a bit flustered in the water where her feet didn't touch the bottom, so she clung to me from the front.

Ohhh... she's so soft!

While battling such temptations, if we gave in to them, both of us would end up drowning. So, I held onto Sicily for dear life.

After a while, we returned to the boat, but the soft sensation of Sicily lingered on my body, and I had no idea whether my fishy smell had disappeared.

"Phew, haah... did the smell come off?"

"Huh? Oh... it might have come off... maybe?"

Sniff, sniff "It seems to be okay. Shall we go back to where everyone is?"

"Y-Yeah."

Sicily had been so desperate that she didn't remember what happened earlier... or perhaps, she didn't understand what had happened.

Feeling somewhat tormented on my own, I operated the boat and returned to where everyone was.

"Oh! They've finally returned! What were you doing out there in the sea?"

"You guys... doing something like this outdoors..."

"Are you idiots? We were fishing out at sea!"

"Fishing?"

"Look!"

I said this and brought out the fish we had just caught into the boat.

"Wait a minute! This is more like fishing than anything else!"

"Really? I was thinking we might have overfished a bit."

"Where did you get bait out there?"

"We used this."

Saying that, I showed them the homemade lure.

"What's this?"

"It's a lure."

"A lure?"

"It's artificial bait. You attach this and throw it into the sea, then reel it in like this..."

While explaining, I demonstrated.

"See! This is how fish bite!"

Indeed, when I immediately caught a fish that bit the bait, everyone looked surprised.

"Why... can fish be caught with such a method?"

"Fish eat smaller fish as their prey, so this lure is made to resemble those smaller fish."

"This is amazing! It's bound to be a big hit if it's put on the market!"

"There are many girls who don't want to touch live bait, so it might sell surprisingly well in unexpected places."

"With the float earlier and now the boat, you keep coming up with new things..."

"Also, for playing on the beach, there are items like these."

Saying that, I took out a beach ball.

"Lin! Go over there!"

"Leave it to me."

"Hyaah! Take this!"

We took out the beach ball and started playing beach volleyball.

Since there was no volleyball in this world, I explained the rules very simply. Originally, it's played with two pairs on each side, but since everyone was inexperienced, we played with four on each side.

We started beach volleyball across the makeshift net, and to be honest, we were all quite clumsy. However, that added an element of fun to the game. After a few matches, everyone started getting really into it.

By the way, magic was allowed, and there were scenes that resembled something out of an anime here and there.

I got carried away as well, and before I knew it, the sun was starting to set.

"Phew... I'm tired. Should we head back soon?"

"Yes, we should... it's almost... dinner time."

Thor was panting, and everyone else was exhausted too.

"Phew... you guys are still quite energetic."

"Ah, it's good to have energy."

Saying this, I looked at the grandpa and grandma who approached us.

In just one day, they had turned a nice tan color.

They got tanned so quickly, didn't they?

But what really caught my eye was grandma. She was wearing a straw hat, sunglasses, and had left her shirt unbuttoned, displaying a deep sun tan.

There was a pretty funky grandpa among us.

"Gramps, did you become a delinquent?"

"I didn't become a delinquent! I've always tanned easily. I'm also sensitive to sunlight, so I can't do without sunglasses in the summer at the beach."

I see, that's how it is. I thought grandpa had turned into a delinquent or something.

"Okay, it's time to head back! Let's return to the cottages and take a shower. But remember, it has to be with water."

"Oh, right."

I had completely forgotten about grandma's warning.

If you stay on the sandy beach under the scorching sun like this...

"Ouch, ouch, ouch!"

This is what happens. It hurts!

"Ahh!"

After taking a shower behind me, Sicily seemed to have streaks on her tanned skin from the water, and her screams could be heard.

This kind of thing eventually turns into mild sunburn, so I'll heal it later.

Oh, but I wonder if using magic to heal it would remove the sunburn? I'm not sure.

Well, it's okay. If you can't stand it any longer, I'll heal you. Would it be better not to use any magic until then?

During this vacation, dinner was planned to be a barbecue held in the central square of the cottage area.

"K-Kenja-sama... Is something the matter?"

"Do you have any worries? We're here for you!"

"I don't have anything!"

The transformed grandpa had become the center of attention for everyone.

However, it seemed like he was transformed for a reason, maybe due to some dissatisfaction.

"Being called a sage suits you. To attract everyone's attention in such a way..."

Lois, please don't imitate him.

"Seems like everyone is having fun."

And when I went to the royal castle for today's regular update, I brought with me Uncle Dis, who was waiting at the security guards' station.

"Ah! Mother!"

"Oh, Mei, have you been a good girl?"

"Yes!"

That's right, it wasn't just Uncle Dis who was waiting.

Uncle Dis's wife.

The queen, who is the mother of Aug and Mei-chan, was with him.

"Your Majesty, you arrived late."

"You don't need to say that! Even though there's such a convenient magic as Shin-kun's Gate, there's no need to take a dangerous carriage ride, is there?"

"What's your real reason?"

"Carriage rides are tiring!"

The queen seemed quite relaxed. When she met me earlier...

"I believe you call my husband 'Uncle Dis'? In that case, you can call me Auntie Julia!"

"A-Auntie Julia...?"

"Yes, that's right. So please be nice to me!"

She said with a wink.

The queen... Auntie Julia is a platinum blonde woman who gives off a truly regal impression.

But she's not just someone who stays inside the royal castle holding tea parties. She's very dedicated to welfare, not only providing plans and funding but also personally visiting welfare facilities and orphanages, valuing interaction with the people of Arsheid. She's a friendly queen who's beloved by the citizens.

The royal family here, including Uncle Dis, consists of easygoing people.

Well, that's why they're so popular with the people.

"It's been a while, Your Majesty, Queen. I am extremely honored to be able to welcome Your Majesty again."

"Yeah, drop the formality. Isn't it time to take a break on our day off?"

"Yes, I understand."

"Phew, finally feeling relaxed."

Saying that, Uncle Dis started to unwind.

"Oh, right. Chef, we caught some fish in the sea, could you help us clean them?"

"I understand. Please bring them here."

He pointed to a bucket, and I placed the fish we had caught during the day into it.

"Wow! So many?"

The bucket was overflowing. Did we catch too much after all?

"Mother, mother!"

"What is it, Mei?"

"This! I caught it!"

Saying that, Mei took out fish from her 'own' dimensional storage.

"Dimensional storage!?"

"Mother?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. This is amazing!"

"Hehehe."

"Mei, your dimensional storage..."

"I learned it from Shin Onii-chan! It's convenient!"

"Shin-kun..."

"Dimensional storage is quite useful, you know?"

"Right, it's good. Do you understand the abnormality of a ten-year-old using dimensional storage?"

"?" "I could use it when I was five."

"Shin-kun is an exception. If this continues, Mei will be called a genius magician."

"That's a cold thing to say! Well, maybe she is a genius, though?"

"It's fine for a normal family, but Mei may have trouble finding a husband at this rate."

Oh, so a princess stronger than myself might have difficulty getting married...

"I don't need to get married. I'll hunt monsters with Shin Onii-chan!"

"Is that so?"

In response to Mei-chan's words about not needing to get married, he seemed a bit relieved.

Come to think of it, I don't hear much about political marriages in this country.

"Like August Onii-sama, I'll hunt tigers!"

"Is that so..."

Even though it's the same line, now he looks awkward.

"Long time no see, Julia, are you doing well?"

"Oh, Merida-sama, it's been a while!"

Saying that, it seemed that Grandma and Merida-sama knew each other well.

Then, Ellie was called over, followed by Sicily, and the ladies of each household gathered around. They began to give various advice to Sicily and Ellie, who would become wives in the future.

"My my, women are full of energy."

"You got that right."

Og and I realized that we couldn't compete with that and moved away from the group of women.

"I'd like to enjoy my vacation until it gets busy when it's over."

"Three-country conference, huh?"

"It's going to be quite a significant conference. I hope to maintain our leadership and get both countries to cooperate."

"Hmm..."

"What's the matter, Shin?"

"Well, there's something that's been bothering me."

"Something bothering you?"

After the second attack by the demons, after returning to Arlsheid, there was something on my mind.

"We've won against the demons twice, haven't we? The second battle ended without any casualties."

"Yeah, except for the wheat field you blew up."

"Ugh! Well, that's beside the point! But there's something that's been circulating around the city that's been bothering me."

"What's being said?"

Right now, there's a common whisper circulating in the royal capital of Arlsheid. It is...

"Demons are no big deal."

Since we repelled the demons without causing too much damage, such rumors have spread throughout the royal capital.

"Is that true? What's happening?"

"Yeah, I heard quite a few of those voices when I went shopping during this trip."

Among the people of Arlsheid, this trend is emerging.

"This is a serious problem..."

"Could this affect the Three-Country Conference? If it's such an easy victory, people might say we're not needed."

"I hope not... I don't think that's the case, but..."

"Keep it in mind, just in case. It's more than a little concerning to me."

"Okay, I understand."

The thing that scares me the most is if this trend spreads among the soldiers. In the Swid Kingdom, ordinary soldiers couldn't even hold a candle to the demons. If they underestimate the demons to be no big deal, it could result in significant casualties. I can only hope that doesn't happen...

While watching everyone having a good time, only the two of us had solemn expressions.
