Shaolin's request, you say.

"Is it for your sister's treatment?"

"Yes."

Shaolin affirmed my words and looked at Sicily with pleading eyes.

Sicily, in response, smiled warmly.

"Understood. I will come right away."

"Thank you! Now, about the luggage... Oh, but Sir Sicily doesn't have any luggage."

"Yes, let's head there immediately. Please wait in the room, everyone. I'm sorry, but would it be acceptable for Shin to accompany me?"

"I will explain to my sister that Sir Sicily's husband is here, so it should be fine."

"Then, please lead the way."

"Understood."

And so, Sicily and I separated from the group and headed to Shaolin's sister's room.

Shaolin's house, like the other houses in Elon, was a two-story building with wooden flooring.

The room had regular doors, not sliding paper doors.

We passed through several rooms and stopped in front of a particular one.

"This is the room."

Shaolin said, her expression tense, and she knocked on the door.

A male voice from inside responded, as if in answer to her knock.

"I'm Shaolin."

When Shaolin said this, there was a sound from inside the room, and the door was quickly opened.

A man in his mid-twenties appeared from inside the room.

He had slightly long black hair and had a somewhat refined appearance.

"ーーーー？"

"ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー"

The man who came out and Shaolin seemed to be having a conversation, but I at least understood the name "Shaolin" at the beginning.

After a short while of talking with the excited man, he turned towards us, gestured, and said something.

"My apologies. This is Shaolin's sister's husband, Sir Yunha."

"－－－－－！　－－－－－！"

"He's saying 'I'm Yunha, nice to meet you.'"

The man bowed while saying something, probably a self-introduction.

So, it's our turn.

"I'm Shin. This is my wife, Sicily. We will be in charge of your wife's treatment this time."

"Nice to meet you."

"This time, Sicily will be the one conducting the treatment, but I am Sicily's mentor in the healing magic. So, please allow me to be present during the treatment."

"Oh, I see. Thank you in advance for that."

With Shaolin acting as an interpreter and intermediary, we exchanged introductions and conveyed my request to be present during the treatment, which was also approved.

"Now, please enter the room," Yunha said, prompting Sicily and me to enter.

Inside the room, there was a woman who looked like an older and more seductive version of Shaolin lying on the bed. However, she wasn't completely immobile as her upper body was propped up.

As soon as the woman saw Shaolin, her eyes welled up with tears, and she reached out to embrace Shaolin tightly. After exchanging a few words, the two of them turned to us.

"Lord Shin, Lady Sicily, this is my sister, Suiran."

"Suiran, it's a pleasure to meet you."

"Huh... Suiran, your language..."

"My sister, like me, has been studying the Western language. She can speak a little."

"I see. I'm Shin, and this is my wife, Sicily. Sicily will be in charge of your treatment this time."

"I'm Sicily. Nice to meet you."

"Pleased to meet you."

Though a bit halting, we were able to communicate without an interpreter.

We can only speak the common language of the West, so this was quite impressive.

Shaolin and Suiran seemed to be having a conversation, but they turned back to us after a while.

"We have received approval for Sicily's treatment and for Shin to accompany her. We would like to begin the treatment right away..."

"Oh, yes! Understood."

Sicily said this and approached Suiran's bed, about to lift the covers.

As she reached for the covers, she looked in our direction, so I and Lifan tried to avoid looking in their direction.

Yunha, being Suiran's husband, continued to watch. After a while, we heard Sicily saying things like "amazing" and "with this, such and such..."

"How is it, Sicily? Is everything going well?"

"Oh, yes. I think it's mostly thanks to these talismans; she's maintaining a state very similar to the person who came to the clinic."

That's what Sicily said.

Talismans must be pretty remarkable.

Thinking so, I spoke to Lifan, who was with me.

"Why do those talismans activate with so little? Also, do they last?"

"Ah, those are made by grinding magic stones finely and mixing them with ink. They require magical power to activate, but once activated, they will last until the magic power in the magic stones runs out."

"Oh, using magic stones for that..."

"We can get quite a few magic stones in this region. I remember seeing magic stones on sale in Els, and the prices shocked me. You can buy them more affordably here."

"I see. So, does this country have many volcanoes or faults?"

Magic stones are often found in places with high temperature and pressure.

While it was just a thought, Lifan heard my musing and expressed her curiosity.

"We do have some, but not that many. There's something called the Magic Stone Mine where you can get a considerable amount of magic stones."

"Huh?"

A magic stone mine?

There are mines dedicated to mining magic stones?

"What does that mean..."

"－－－－－－－－!!"

As I was about to inquire further about the Magic Stone Mine, a loud voice came from behind.

I briefly turned to look, but Sicily's loud voice, saying, "You can't look yet!" stopped me from doing so.

After waiting for a while, we received permission to turn around. When we did, we saw Suiran and Yunha hugging, both with tears in their eyes, and Shaolin crying while watching them.

"Sicily?"

Beside the three of them, Sicily was sitting in a chair with a relieved expression. I asked her, and she looked at me and smiled.

"She's healed. She's fine now."

"I see. You did great, Sicily."

"No, it's thanks to you, Shin. Because of what you taught me, I was able to cure Suiran's illness."

"But it was your hard work, Sicily. So, you can be proud."

I said that and placed my hand on Sicily's shoulder.

In response, Sicily placed her hand on top of mine.

"Yes, thank you, Shin."

Sicily's face, as she said this, looked a little shy but also filled with happiness.

Suiran's illness was successfully cured, and it boosted Sicily's confidence.

Things were going well on this end.

Thinking this, I intended to continue the conversation with Lifan.

"By the way, Lifan, about what we were talking..."

As I started to ask, Suiran and Yunha began speaking excitedly, and Yunha rushed outside in a hurry.

What's going on?

"Apologies, Lord Shin. My sister and brother-in-law were adamant about thanking everyone and wanted to celebrate by hosting a dinner, so my brother-in-law hurried out to prepare the feast."

Ah, I see. It took me by surprise, wondering what was happening.

Thinking that, I looked at the door through which Yunha had left, and Suiran approached me.

"Sicily-sama, Shin-sama, thank you very much."

She said this, bowing deeply.

Seeing Suiran like that, Sicily got up from her chair and placed her hand on Suiran's shoulder.

"Please raise your head, Suiran. I only did what I could."

Sicily said with a smile.

After seeing Sicily like that, Suiran muttered something quietly.

Hearing this murmur, Shaolin burst into a peculiar giggle.

What's going on?

"Oh, sorry. My sister just referred to Sicily-sama as a 'celestial maiden.' It's because no matter where we go, people tend to see Sicily-sama that way."

"Celestial maiden?"

"In Kuanglong, they use the term 'celestial maiden' to refer to what you would call a saint. It means a woman loved by the gods or a woman resembling a god. By the way, Lord Shin is not only known as the King of Mages but also as the Messenger of God. In that context, Lord Shin and Lady Sicily make a perfect match, don't they?"

Shaolin said this and murmured something to Suiran.

Upon hearing Shaolin's words, Suiran looked at me and Sicily, nodding approvingly.

Ah, Suiran must have heard that story from Shaolin. Well, I'd rather not spread that kind of information.

After chatting with Suiran for a while, even though the illness was cured, she was still in the process of recovering.

Suiran seemed to have exhausted a lot of her energy, so we decided to let her rest for a while, and we left her room.

Shaolin and Lifan continued to stay in the room.

As we left the room, the servant who had guided us earlier was waiting in front of it and began guiding us again.

I realized that without Shaolin or Lifan, it was difficult to communicate.

Well, as long as the servant can lead us to the room, it should be fine.

Thinking that, I followed the servant.

Before long, we were led to a room that appeared to be more like a reception area than a place for lodging. Inside, everyone had already changed into casual attire and was relaxing.

"Ah, Shin, Sicily, is it over?"

Maria asked as she sipped on the juice that had been offered.

"Yeah, Suiran... Shaolin's sister has been successfully treated."

"Yes, we were able to treat her successfully."

As Sicily and I said this, we heard an "Oh" from everyone. The members of the Els delegation, in particular, seemed visibly relieved.

"That's really great to hear. So, are we able to have a detailed conversation with her sister and all now?"

"Yes, I believe so. She's still a bit weak, but I think she'll recover quickly if she eats well and rests."

In response to Naval's question, Sicily replied, and the expression of relief on her face turned into one of happiness.

"That's wonderful. In that case, we can discuss the dragon leather trade. Thanks to Lady Saint's hard work this time, it seems like we can negotiate in our favor."

"If we were of help, we're glad. But Suiran has just recovered from her illness and looks really happy, so please try not to make any unreasonable demands, okay?"

"Ah, hahaha. Of course, I understand!"

Naval said that, but I couldn't overlook the fact that he was grinning.

...Or at least, that was my intention.

After speaking with Sicily, Naval began hurriedly discussing matters with the members of the delegation, likely considering changing the nature of their demands.

It's really something how they'll try to squeeze out as much as possible once they think they can profit...

"Oh."

I suddenly remembered something I had intended to ask Lifan but had completely forgotten about.

"What's the matter, Shin?"

"No, actually, I heard an incredible story from Lifan earlier."

As I said that, not only Aug but also the members of the delegation, including Naval, showed interest in our conversation.

They seem overly eager about this "incredible story."

"So, what's this incredible story?"

Naval seemed to catch wind of a business opportunity and had a big smile on his face.

"Well, it's about the talismans they use in this country."

"...Is it about magic then?"

I thought it might be related to profits, but since it was a discussion about magic, Naval's expression changed as if he had lost interest.

Too obvious.

"The thing is, these talismans, once activated, seem to have a lasting effect."

"Indeed, when I removed one, I still felt the magical activity."

"Oh, really?"

Alice replied to Sicily's statement. It seemed like she didn't fully understand it.

But some people did realize the significance.

"Wait a minute! You mean to tell me that the effects continue even after you remove it from someone's body!?"

Yuri, unusually excited, jumped into the conversation.

Yuri would be the one to notice, for sure.

"That's weird! Those are magical tools, right? Magical tools should deactivate once they're out of someone's hands!"

Mark, who also crafts magical tools back at home, noticed the anomaly.

"Indeed, magical tools are supposed to deactivate once they're no longer in contact with a person..."

Oug seemed to realize as he was saying this.

"No way... is it about those talismans?"

"Yeah, it seems they're made by mixing crushed magic stones into ink."

Naval was the first to react to that statement.

"They mix magic stones with ink? What a waste!"

His expression was seriously angry.

That expression reminded me of when he discovered a toilet with a built-in cleaning function in the Walford Trading Company in the Royal Capital. He wore the same expression when he demanded to know why we hadn't told him about it.

Yuri and Mark, who are involved in crafting magical tools, were in agreement with Naval.

"That's really something. If they do that, a single talisman could fetch an unimaginable price!"

"Can their house be wealthy enough to afford that?"

Indeed, I thought the same thing at first.

However...

"It seems that might not be the case."

"Huh?"

Naval, Yuri, and Mark's voices overlapped.

"Earlier, Lifan mentioned that when she saw magic stones in Els, she was shocked by their price."

"The price... you mean?"

As expected, Aug caught on quickly.

"Yes. It seems she was surprised by how expensive they were."

As I said this, I could hear everyone, especially Naval, gasp in disbelief.

"It appears there's a place called the Magic Stone Mine where a significant amount of magic stones are extracted."

When I said this much, Naval grabbed my shoulder.

"N-Naval-san?"

"Your Majesty! This is an unbelievable story!"

He screamed with an expression I had never seen before.

"Settle down! Not so loud! The information about being able to purchase magic stones cheaply, along with dragon leather... if anyone hears about it..."

As Naval said this, he looked at Aug, who had a sly expression.

Aug's face... had a sly, sly grin.

"Sorry, Naval Diplomat. I heard you loud and clear. Naturally, we'll also participate in the magic stone purchase, don't you think?"

Upon hearing those words, Naval sank to his knees.

"If we could monopolize the sale of magic stones, we would have made a fortune..."

He uttered in despair, but...

"No, even without a monopoly, establishing a trade route for magic stones would be a significant achievement, wouldn't it? It might even put you in the running for the next presidency."

That's right.

If they could trade with a mine that produced magic stones at such low prices, it would undoubtedly bring in huge profits, even without a monopoly.

It's a remarkable achievement to be part of the first such endeavor among the western countries.

Realizing this, Naval quickly rallied and gathered the members of the delegation.

"Don't dilly-dally around! Let's start the negotiations for magic stone trade right away!"

With that, Naval immediately began discussions with the members of the delegation.

"Oh dear, I never expected something like this. When it comes to dragon leather trading, I didn't insist on Els having priority since I first heard about it. But now that we've heard about the magic stones, that changes things. We'll have a piece of the action too."

"Well, it's not my decision. In the end, it's a negotiation with... I don't know, magic stone merchants or something?"

"No, ideally, we'd like to trade directly with the Magic Stone Mine. But where is it located?"

"I haven't asked that yet. And there's also something that's been bothering me."

"And what is that?"

When I said that, Aug fell silent.

"What's wrong?"

"Well... your 'bothering' tends to lead to nothing good, so I'm afraid to ask."

Even though he said that...

And besides, it's not me, but Aug, who seems to be concerned about the matter.

"Well, you see, I was thinking that if they can mine so many magic stones, this country must have many volcanoes and fault lines. But..."

"Wait, are you saying that's not the case? Or perhaps your theory was wrong?"

"No, it's not that. I've conducted experiments and verified it. Magic stones indeed require high temperature and pressure."

"So..."

"Yes, it's just that this country doesn't have many volcanoes or fault lines."

After sharing this information, everyone fell silent.

"Huh? What do you mean?"

It seemed that Alice was just silent because she didn't understand.

Seeing her like that, Lin sighed.

"You see, Alice. What Wolforde-kun is saying is that magic stones aren't refined under the conditions he discovered."

"Why? What's going on?"

"That's what's strange, isn't it?"

Even though Lin explained, it seemed Alice still didn't understand, so Tony added further clarification.

"It's certain that the conditions Wolforde-sama discovered are necessary for refining magic stones."

"However, if it's not the case, and they are still being mined, what does that mean?"

In response to the questions from Thor and Julius, Alice thought for a moment and said:

"Maybe someone buried them or something?"

After saying that, she laughed, as if she thought it was a ridiculous idea.

But...

"That might not be entirely wrong."

"Huh?"

Alice, the one who said it, seemed taken aback by the possibility that she might be agreed with.

Then, Olivia made a crucial point.

"So you mean there might be ancient ruins in the magic stone mine that produce magic stones?"
