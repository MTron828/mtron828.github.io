The elevation has been significantly lowered, and it's dropped to about the same height as the exterior walls.

In other words, it's naturally exposed to people's eyes, and it's a distance where you can even see their surprised expressions with their mouths wide open.

As we waited for a while, armed soldiers and unarmed individuals came out in large numbers from the gate.

It seems like they were waiting for this.

Once we confirmed their presence, the flying boat descended slowly.

We remained cautious, but the soldiers stood in formation without raising their weapons.

It appears they have no hostile intentions.

If they had shown any hostile intentions here, it would have been a diplomatic issue with no room for excuses, and establishing diplomatic relations would have become impossible.

Trade would also be impossible, so Shaolin's wishes would all be in vain.

She seems to understand this well, as she visibly relaxed when observing her country's soldiers' response.

Eventually, the flying boat landed on the ground, and the Els delegation, led by Naval, opened the door.

Then, the Ultimate Magicians, led by Org, followed. Now they're a delegation from Arsheid.

Finally, Shaolin and Liefan disembarked with the official and soldiers they had captured at the border village between the desert and the nation.

Among the officials and soldiers lined up, a person wearing particularly extravagant clothing stepped forward.

This person is probably in charge of the negotiations this time.

They immediately began to speak.

"Welcome to Kuanglong. I am the chief negotiator, Hao."

Listening to Shaolin's interpreter, Naval responded with a smile, "Thank you for the warm welcome; we are deeply moved."

Wow.

Naval really emphasized "deeply moved." Well, Shaolin's interpreter is there, and I don't think the nuances will be lost.

Hao, upon hearing Naval's words, smiled and looked at the officials and soldiers tied up behind us.

Then, he said something again, "These are messengers. I'm asking why they are tied up."

"Messengers? In this country, do you call those who suddenly attack diplomatic delegations and attempt to seize our flying boat 'messengers'?"

Naval, isn't that too aggressive all of a sudden?

Shaolin, who is acting as an interpreter, also looks a bit pale.

Upon hearing the interpreter, Hao frowned, became very angry, and started shouting.

"Um... Who decided to choose such people as messengers... huh?"

After shouting something, Hao said something to Shaolin once again.

"Well, we will handle those unruly individuals here, so please hand them over to us."

"Is that so? Then, I'll hand them over."

Naval said this and brought the tied-up officials in front of Hao and his group.

"Now, for their severe punishment..."

Just as Hao was about to say this,

"-----!"

Hao suddenly drew the sword hanging at his waist and beheaded one of the officials.

The remaining soldiers also began to cut down the officials who had been standing near Hao one after another.

In response to this excessively brutal punishment, we were left speechless, and the envoys, who had little tolerance for human deaths, looked pale, although the monsters didn't seem to bother them as much.

Ah, is this the purpose?

Perhaps they want to instill fear by showing such extreme violence from the beginning.

Indeed, the envoys seem a bit pale.

However,

"That's quite ruthless. In this country, do they execute people without a trial?"

Nawal said this very calmly.

We fought against demons during the Demon King War, after all.

Despite being demons on the inside, they're still human.

We've killed our fair share of them, so even when we see a person being killed right before our eyes, we don't feel fear.

We just furrow our brows slightly.

Well... I'm not sure if that's a good thing either...

But Nawal is not a combatant.

So, why is he so calm? In Els, do business negotiations often involve people getting killed?

...Oh, never mind.

Upon closer inspection, his legs are trembling slightly.

Fortunately, Hao doesn't seem to notice, and he looks a bit surprised while listening to Shaolin's interpretation.

"He apologizes for the inconvenience and offers to provide hospitality as an apology."

"Is that so? Then, let's rest for today and have a discussion tomorrow."

When Shaolin interpreted for Hao, he smiled and said something before getting on a carriage.

"They have prepared carriages for you, so please get on them. They will guide you to the government headquarters."

Upon closer inspection, it became evident that the carriage Hao boarded was not the only one prepared. Several carriages were ready, so they must be aware of our group's size.

The capital seems quite spacious, which is fortunate.

As we were about to head towards the carriages following Hao's instructions, Shaolin approached with a question.

"Um... What should we do with the flying boat?"

"Oh, Shin."

"Hmm?"

"Can it fit into your extradimensional storage?"

"It can."

"Alright, then please store it."

"Understood."

Upon Oug's request, I opened an extradimensional storage beneath the flying boat. The flying boat was absorbed into the extradimensional storage as if it were being sucked into the ground.

"Shall we go then?"

"Wha... wha..."

Huh?

Shaolin seems to be a bit flustered.

"What's wrong, Shaolin?"

"What's wrong, she says! What's up with the entrance of that huge extradimensional storage!"

"Huh?"

What's she talking about?

"We're storing the flying boat, so it has to be big enough to fit, right?"

"Well, yes! Of course!"

Shaolin appears to be scratching her head, puzzled.

Seriously, what's going on?

As I observed Shaolin's inexplicable behavior, Oug put a hand on her shoulder.

"This is just the beginning. Shin's lack of common sense is truly ruthless."

What is he talking about? Anyone could do this.

Why do I have to hear something like this?

I was irritated by Oug's unreasonable statement, but Shaolin displayed a tired expression.

"I see..."

Why is she believing this so easily?

I wondered about that, but it became apparent why Shaolin believed so quickly.

"It may really be a reincarnation of the ancient civilization people."

Ah, she really believed that.

"I never expected such a response."

Hao, who got into the carriage ahead of Shin and the others, murmured to his aide sitting with him.

"I agree. Especially, I didn't expect those young people to remain unfazed."

"It's usually the older ones who turn pale."

"Who are they, though? They don't seem to have the age or experience for it."

"I don't know. But they seem different from the people in the small surrounding nations who would obey anything you say if you put it forcefully."

"That could be troublesome."

"Do you think so?"

Hao said that and grinned.

"It might be more interesting that way."

Afterward, as Shin and the others also boarded the carriage, the one carrying Hao slowly began to move.

Their destination: the government headquarters.

Where the Emperor of Kuanglong resides.
