Accompanied by Shaolin, we passed through the gate and emerged onto the top of the village's defensive wall.

"It's amazing... It really is the village's defensive facility," Shaolin muttered softly as she looked around. She must have been here before, being someone associated with the dragon leather trade.

She probably visited this village as it serves as a hunting ground. All in all, it seemed like allowing Shaolin to accompany me was the right decision.

"Shaolin, we're heading to assist the others, so please don't move from here."

"Yes, understood."

Upon hearing Shaolin's response, I deployed reconnaissance magic from the top of the wall, scanning for the location where people and dragons were gathering.

And then...

From a certain direction, a loud explosion sound reached us.

"This is...!"

I checked the location using reconnaissance, and...

"Wolford-kun! It's turned into monsters!"

"It certainly seems that way."

Feeling the magical power of the dragon monsters, we could deduce that the Ogres were involved in the earlier explosion.

"What should we do?"

"I'd like to go there at least."

"We came all this way; it would be a shame not to do anything."

After confirming with Mark and Olivia, it seemed they wanted to head to the scene as well.

Well, we came here to assist, and it wouldn't make sense if it was already over.

"That being said, it might already be over, though."

"Even so, we should go."

"Alright, then let's join the Ogres for now."

"Got it!"

"Yes!"

We activated our jet boots and flew out from the top of the wall toward the scene.

Upon arriving at the scene, we saw that Lin had just severed the neck of a dragon turned into a monster using a water jet.

"What's the matter? In the end, Lin is also beheading them."

"Huh? Wolford-kun?"

"You were saying you liked beheading people, and now you're doing it yourself."

"There's no helping it. It's His Majesty's request."

"Ogres' request?"

"Yes. It was ordered not to damage the materials."

"I see, that makes sense."

I used to behead animals when hunting for food in the past. Beheading is the cleanest way to preserve the materials.

Since there were no more signs of dragons in the village, we had the gates, normally used to enter the fort, opened for us.

Inside, the villagers who had taken shelter welcomed us.

"Lord Shin!"

From among the villagers, Shaolin, whom we had escorted earlier, came towards us.

"Everyone, are you all safe?"

Shaolin looked at the Ogres and breathed a sigh of relief.

Dragons that hadn't transformed into monsters are a piece of cake!

No problem at all.

Alice and Lin gave Shaolin a triumphant look.

Shaolin's face twitched slightly.

"Actually, it was much worse when Lord Shin dropped a wyvern from the sky."

"I'm sorry!"

Maria, you're going to hear that for a while.

"A wyvern?"

Huh? Shaolin's face wore an expression mixed with astonishment and anticipation.

"Yes, Lord Shin took them all down in one shot. It was directly above us..."

"Wyverns fell from the sky."

"So sorry!"

Even Toru and Julius!?

Surprised by the unexpected bombardment, Shaolin approached me with an excited look.

"Um, Lord Shin!"

"Yes?"

"Regarding the damage to the defeated wyverns..."

"Oh, I see. I shot them all in the forehead, but since they fell from the sky..."

Ultimately, what about the condition of their bodies?

I didn't examine it closely.

Thinking about it, Tony and Yuri stepped forward.

"We've collected them. Do you want to take a look?"

"At first glance, it doesn't seem to be damaged."

Saying so, they took out the wyverns from their dimensional storage.

"This... many!?"

Once again, Shaolin exclaimed in astonishment.

Is it really that rare?

Ignoring our confusion, Shaolin excitedly examined the wyverns.

"No damage to the wings... this is a top-notch specimen!"

Shaolin's expression was filled with joy.

"Lord Shin!"

"Whoa! Yes?"

With that expression, she suddenly turned her gaze towards me.

I was... surprised.

"Can we sell all these hunted dragons, including this wyvern?"

"Oh? Well, that's fine."

"Really? Thank you so much!!"

Wow, Shaolin looks incredibly happy.

"Um, is this wyvern really that rare?"

"Wyverns themselves aren't that rare, but hunting them is quite... Moreover, hunting them without damaging their wings is difficult."

Ah, well, they do fly after all.

So, the strategy is to target their wings when hunting.

"Wyvern leather is more valuable than their body due to the thin yet durable nature of their wings. However, as I mentioned earlier, the number that can be hunted is limited, and most of them have some kind of damage."

"Oh, I see. So, this..."

"Yes! Unharmed, and in this quantity!! I've never seen anything like this!"

I see. Well, in that case, it's understandable why Shaolin is so excited.

"Well then, let's discuss the price immediately..."

"Shaolin-dono, I apologize, but could we do that once we return?"

"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry! It's just that my merchant instincts got the better of me... I've never seen so many wyverns before."

I guess she got carried away with excitement after seeing such an unprecedented quantity of wyverns.

Shaolin didn't come here for the purpose of buying dragon leather. She came to guide us to a village near the dragon habitat. Remembering that, she apologized to Ogre.

"Well, given the circumstances, I don't think it's unreasonable. But right now, we have other priorities."

"Yes... I came along for that very reason, but... I'm sorry."

"No problem. But more importantly, I'd like to head to the next location as soon as possible."

"Understood. Can I see the map?"

At Shaolin's request, I spread out the map we borrowed on a nearby table.

While looking at the map, Shaolin marked a few spots on it.

"The dragon habitat areas nearby are here, here, and here."

"I see. Near those habitats, is there..."

"Yes. There's a village that serves as a base for hunting those dragons."

Listening to Shaolin's explanation and looking at the marks on the map, Sicily expressed her honest thoughts.

"It's quite far away..."

Indeed, I thought the same.

"Dragons are large creatures, and their food chain is self-contained within the dragon habitat. So, one habitat is quite extensive."

Ah, I see. That's why the village serving as a base is far away.

However, such vast habitats...

"In that case, there might be more dragons than we expected..."

"Perhaps. But first and foremost, it's important to protect the areas where people live. We can gradually hunt the dragons that have multiplied within their habitats."

"For now, minimizing human casualties should be the top priority."

"We'd appreciate it if you could do that."

It seems that Ogre and Shaolin have come to an agreement.

"All right. Let's start visiting the nearby areas from here. Shaolin-dono, we're counting on your guidance."

"Yes! Leave it to me!"

"Are we going already?"

"Yeah. Shin, I'm counting on you again."

"Okay."

Upon Ogre's request, I cast levitation magic on everyone.

"Wow! Whoa! Again!"

Shaolin seems surprised, but she doesn't appear to be frightened.

As for Leifan...

I'm sorry, but please bear with it.

"Sicily, I hate to ask, but could you take Shaolin and guide her?"

"Yes, understood."

Since Shaolin is a woman, it's better for a woman to lead her, I thought, and asked Sicily to do it.

So...

"Leifan, I'll guide you again."

"..."

Oh my... The stern-looking Leifan seems to have an indescribable bitter expression on his face.

"Let's go then!"

"Yes!"

Under Ogre's command, everyone activates wind magic and begins moving.

"Waah!"

Shaolin, holding hands with Sicily, lets out a delighted voice.

As for Leifan...

"Nuuuaah!"

...I wonder if he can hold it in until we get there?

Oh... I forgot to ask Mark about his story.
