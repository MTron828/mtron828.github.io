"Huh! Is that voice Strom!?"

A voice I had heard a few times before resonated in the surroundings.

The voice and speaking style, filled with delight, were undoubtedly Strom.

"Hehe, that's right. Finally, the time has come. I've been looking forward to it."

Huh? I hadn't used amplification magic right now. Despite that, Strom responded to my voice with her own.

"You, can you hear my voice...?"

"Yes, I can hear it."

As I suspected.

"Until recently, I could only send my voice, and I completely forgot about listening to your responses... I regret not knowing what kind of interesting reactions you had."

"This guy... what a joke..."

Before, if she had been listening to our voices, I wouldn't have made a fool of myself muttering to myself! Look! Even Oug is trying to stifle his laughter and is making a weird face!

"Is this really the Demon Lord for this time? A talking one with its own will?"

"Speaking with its own intentions... it's hard to believe..."

"Grandma, Grandpa..."

My words, which I thought were hostile towards Strom, prompted Grandma and Grandpa to talk to me.

"Is this Merlin the Sage and Melida the Priest?"

"Wha!? How did you know...?"

"Well, the people with me used to be part of the Empire's intelligence division. Now that I have the power of a Demon Lord, it's quite easy for me to investigate your situation over there."

"What!?"

The first one to react to Strom's voice was Dominic. Knowing our situation on this side means she might also be investigating our family. In that case...

"Ah, rest assured. I have all your family details, but I haven't taken any hostage measures or the like."

"Why have you gone to the trouble of investigating that far?"

This is a truly dirty tactic, but if you want to secure victory in battle, taking the opponent's family hostage is a simple way to do so. Moreover, the opponent is a Demon Lord. As Strom herself mentioned earlier, Demon Lords sometimes view humans as insignificant beings.

A Demon Lord who investigated the opponent's family structure and yet did nothing?

It's just hard to believe.

"My subordinates are quite competent, you know. They investigate things even without being asked."

In my mind, the memories of the Demon Lord we fought a few days ago resurface. Unlike the previous commoners turned into demons, these ones had been cornering Oug and the others. There was a moment when they almost harmed Sicily. Remembering this, my anger flared up again.

"However..."

While my anger welled up, Strom, in stark contrast, seemed to be enjoying herself as she said:

"But you know, it wouldn't be fun to do something like that."

In an instant, the fervor from earlier vanished, and the surroundings fell silent.

"Oh... not fun?"

Dominic said, as if squeezing the words out.

"Indeed. It wouldn't be fun at all if we did something like that."

"Not fun!? You!! Isn't this battle about the survival of humanity and the demons?"

Dominic raised his voice as if he couldn't stand it any longer. It wasn't just Dominic; everyone present felt the same way.

But...

"Hehehe... hahaha, hahahahahahahaha!"

Suddenly, Strom burst into laughter as if she had gone mad.

"W-What's so funny!?"

"What's funny? Oh, it's very funny. Did you forget what I said?"

What Strom had said...

"...A game..."

"As expected of you, Mr. Wolford. You remembered it well."

"Shut up."

"Dear me, you're quite cold. But for me, this is just a game. I find it difficult not to laugh when you come with such a solemn determination."

She's insane.

Strom may call it a game, but this is undoubtedly a great war, one that stakes the survival of humanity and the demons. Yet Strom talks about it as if it's a game and wants to enjoy it. From our perspective as ordinary humans, Strom seems completely deranged.

"A game isn't fun when you cheat to win. That's why I won't take the player's family hostage, so don't worry."

That guy finally started calling us "players."

"Well, let's stop chatting here. We'll be waiting, Mr. Wolford."

After saying that, Strom either deactivated her magic or remained silent.

"She's completely insane."

"Yes, indeed. Kyle was the embodiment of seriousness, but when he turned into a demon, he went on a rampage without discrimination. This time, it seems the person's personality has been significantly affected."

"That's right. Kyle had a strong destructive impulse, but this one..."

"It's... a sense of enjoyment, isn't it? She seems to take pleasure in watching others suffer."

While listening to the conversation between Grandma and Grandpa, Dominic, who was shaking with anger, once again took the megaphone.

"Did you hear me, all of you!? Is it acceptable to leave such a deranged person as she is?! We must win this battle, no matter what!!"

In response to Dominic's angry encouragement, everyone there...

"Yaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!"

...responded with a resounding shout.

They were indignant at being belittled by Strom, and they displayed their determination to face this life-or-death battle.

"Mr. Wolford! Can you open the earth walls for us, please?"

"Yes. Is there any sign of monsters in front of the walls?"

Dominic finally asked me to remove the earth walls that surrounded the old imperial capital. However, if there were monsters in front of the walls, we would immediately be thrown into combat, making it impossible for the troops to enter. So, I inquired with the sentries on the wall.

"It's safe! Based on what I've seen, there are no monsters!"

"Alright, in that case, I'll open the earth walls! Everyone, prepare to advance!"

After conveying this to those around me, I used magic on the earth walls. As a result, the earth walls crumbled from above, creating an opening several meters wide.
