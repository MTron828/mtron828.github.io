After finishing school, the usual time had come when Sicily, who had come over to my house as usual, had gone home, and it was time to go to bed.

I went back to my room, took out a new pair of shoes, and applied a certain enchantment.

The magic I applied was 'Levitation Magic,' and I attached a magic stone to it for constant activation.

At first, I thought about attaching it to my belt, but doing so would make the belt float, causing the body to fall, and I thought that the belt would dig into the body, making it uncomfortable. So, I decided to apply it to my shoes.

Now, all that was left was to wait for Grandpa and Grandma to go to sleep.

While waiting for time to pass, the wireless communication device rang.

"Hello?"

Who could it be at this hour?

I thought that as I answered the call, but...

"Oh, Shin-kun. Are you still awake?"

It was Sicily who had called me.

"No, I was still awake."

"Good. I thought so."

You thought so?

What do you...

"Shin-kun... are you trying to do something dangerous?"

"Huh?"

My heart skipped a beat.

Admittedly, the experiment I was about to carry out could be fatal if I made a mistake. Not to mention, it might leave a significant scar on the world.

That's just how it was. However, I hadn't told Sicily about this experiment to avoid worrying her. I had been careful not to show any signs that she could detect.

And, indeed, Grandpa and Grandma hadn't noticed.

Despite all that...

"Why?"

I was suddenly caught off guard, and my response was somewhat stammered.

"Wait a moment."

Sicily said and then hung up. She immediately opened a gate to my room. Her face seemed slightly angry.

Then, Sicily looked at something.

"Shin-kun, what is this?"

"Huh? Ah!"

Oh no, I had forgotten to hide the shoes right after enchanting them with levitation magic.

"There are magic stones on them."

"Oh, no, this is..."

Even though I wasn't doing anything wrong, I still felt a bit guilty for keeping it a secret from Sicily.

I noticed that Sicily's demeanor became tense when she saw my actions.

"Shin-kun... What were you trying to do?"

From the way she asked the question, I could tell that she hadn't jumped to any strange misconceptions, like me cheating. However, she sensed that I had been keeping something from her and wanted to know what I had planned.

At this point, trying to deceive her could make the situation worse, so I decided to be honest.

"Well... Actually,"

I confessed to Sicily about what I was about to do. In response, Sicily's eyes widened, and she began to shed tears.

"Eh!? Sicily!?"

"You idiot, Shin-kun!"

Before I could ask what was wrong, Sicily shouted at me and then jumped into my chest.

"Why would you try to do something so dangerous on your own? What if something happened, even the slightest thing? What would you do?"

It seemed like she was quite shocked. Sicily, more enraged than she had ever been with me before, was pounding on my chest while crying.

"If something were to happen to you... what should I do...?"

In the end, she pressed her face against my chest and began to sob.

Listening to Sicily's words, I began to imagine what would happen if things went wrong. I hadn't told anyone about this experiment. If something were to go wrong, I would suddenly disappear one day, leaving behind my fianc√©e Sicily, who was so close to me.

I had considered that we might somehow manage with the looming battle against the demons. Og and the others had also become significantly more powerful, and they seemed to have been taking various countermeasures since we were so thoroughly defeated by the demon on Strom's side recently. With everyone's combined efforts, there was a possibility of winning.

But what about Sicily?

I had been thinking of this as my sole responsibility, but I hadn't considered Sicily's feelings at all.

While watching Sicily sob in my arms, I was overwhelmed with immense regret.

"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry, Sicily."

"Sniff... Shin-kun..."

"But... this is something I have to do."

As I said this, Sicily gently distanced herself from me.

"I understand that, but I'm angry because you were trying to secretly do something so important all on your own!"

Sicily pouted, her face turning bright red, and she stared at me with teary eyes.

I see. Sicily understands that it's dangerous but necessary. She's upset because I didn't consult anyone.

"I'm sorry."

"Am I... Are we that unreliable?"

"No, it's not like that."

I just didn't want to worry anyone.

"I'll go with you."

"Huh?"

I wanted to say that Sicily and the others were reliable, but she decided to go with me to the experiment.

"Go...?"

"Actually, I'd like everyone to come if possible... but I'll go with you alone."

"Why..."

"If something were to happen, I'll do everything I can to protect you."

"Well, it's the middle of the night, but maybe we should call the others too..."

It might be selfish and inconvenient to involve them in the middle of the night, but in case of an emergency, it's better to have those who can fight against the demons present.

In Sicily's eyes, I saw unwavering determination.

I'm truly pathetic. I didn't have the same thoughts as Sicily. With my memories from my past life and the lack of any major failures in magical experiments so far, I was overconfident. But Sicily, with her different perspective, was willing to protect me with her life.

I hadn't made such a life-or-death commitment.

If I had conducted the experiment successfully and without consequences, I might have become arrogant. With this magic, I might have believed I couldn't lose. But such thinking might have led me to failure. Sicily made me realize that.

"I'm sorry, Sicily. It seems I've been too complacent."

"Shin-kun..."

"Let's go together. We'll take all precautions to ensure nothing bad happens."

"Yes!"

With this decision made, I needed to grant the same enchantment to Sicily's shoes.

I granted "Levitation Magic" to the shoes I was currently wearing and attached a magic stone.

I've flown in the sky many times using the same magic, and I regularly use jet boots, so the shoes with "Levitation Magic" didn't feel awkward at all.

"By the way, why did you prepare such equipment, and where were you planning to conduct the experiment?"

"Well, that's..."

I opened the balcony door and took Sicily with me, flying into the night sky. As a precaution, I left a note explaining that we were going to perform a magical experiment.

"Is this place okay?"

"Why did you bring us this far? What kind of magic are you planning to try?"

Sicily and I were flying quickly through the night sky, reaching the sea and going further offshore. Although the sky had some clouds, it wasn't a clear starry night.

"Well, you'll see. Now..."

While Sicily was asking questions, I prepared for the magical experiment. I began by gathering mana, pushing it to the absolute limit.

"Th-this is...?"

I had never gathered mana to this extent before. Sicily was astonished by the amount of mana I had, but I couldn't afford to lose focus now.

Then, with determination, I chanted the spell I had in mind.

And...

"Go!!"

I released the magic straight into the sky, and there was no damage on our side.

I was relieved; the experiment was a success. However...

"N-n-nice... nice..."

"Hehe, maybe the power was a bit too much?"

Sicily, who was floating in the air, seemed like she was about to faint.

Well, that's understandable.

Because just a while ago, the clouds that had covered the sky completely disappeared without a trace.

After finishing the magical experiment, we returned home using a gate.

"Looks like this wasn't in vain."

As a precaution, I had burned the note I left behind using magic.

Then, when I looked at Sicily, she was slumped on my bed.

"Sicily, are you okay?"

"Shin-kun..."

Huh? Sicily doesn't seem angry?

"What's wrong..."

"That was such incredible power!"

Ah, she must be surprised by the power of that magic.

Well, I didn't expect it to be so powerful either.

I never thought it would blow away all the clouds in the sky.

"I was scared... I was so scared..."

Sicily had said that it could repel that magic.

Of course, I had no intention of making her do that, so I concentrated intensely.

Still, maybe it wasn't good not to say it beforehand.

Sicily was still trembling slightly.

"I should have told you properly. I'm sorry."

"I won't forgive you."

"Huh?"

Seriously?

She won't forgive me?

It's the first time she's said something like that, so I'm not sure how to react.

"...I'll forgive you if you give me a hug."

Sicily puffed out her cheeks and said that.

Her appearance was so cute that I immediately hugged her.

"I'm sorry."

"...Hug me tighter."

I responded to Sicily's request by hugging her more tightly.

"Don't do dangerous things on your own anymore."

"Yeah, I won't. I got it."

"Trust everyone more."

"Yeah."

Is she more relaxed now?

I thought that and asked her after moving our closely held bodies apart a little.

"Are you going to forgive me now?"

Then, Sicily made an unexpected request.

"...I'll forgive you if you kiss me."

Wasn't hugging supposed to be enough for forgiveness!?

Of course, I will!

"Sicily..."

"Shin-kun..."

That day, Sicily...

Sneaked back quietly just before dawn.
