 ideas
for what to do with my kids' art

Up until then, humans had never turned into monsters.

Monsters were typically wild creatures, beings who couldn't control their magic, and humans believed themselves to be a special race exempt from such transformations.

So when humans began to turn into demons and became known as "Majin" several decades ago, people were shocked.

Humans were not exempt from this phenomenon. The fact that humans could also transform into monsters sent shockwaves through the population, and they despaired at the tremendous threat posed by these Majin.

The sinister magic that emanated from them not only terrified magic users with the ability to sense magic but also instilled fear in ordinary people.

They unleashed magic without incantations, wreaking havoc.

The army of the Kingdom of Arlsheid put all their efforts into subduing the Majin, but the damage only continued to mount.

The only ones who managed to subdue them were the pair of the sage Merlin, known as a hero, and his partner, Merida.

As a result, these two are still revered as heroes.

Before my eyes, there stood a transformed Majin, Kurt.

He was enveloped in the eerie magic unique to monsters, had bright red eyes even in the whites, and was gazing into the void.

Those who witnessed this sight up close were left dumbfounded, likely because it was such a rare case to see a Majin for the first time.

But now is not the time to be lost in thought!

"Everyone, run! He's become a Majin! If you stay here, you'll get caught in the crossfire!"

His words snapped the students back to reality.

"Uwaaah! A Majin! A Majin!?"

"We have to run! We have to run! We have to run! We have to run!"

"H-Help us!"

"Screaaam!"

They screamed while running away.

That's fine. If they run away while shouting, the information will spread to everyone.

The problem is what to do with this guy...

"Og, you should run too."

"Shin, you... Surely not!?"

"Yeah, I'll try to hold him off somehow."

"Fool! You run too!"

Og said, but I couldn't listen.

"If we don't stop him here, a Majin will be unleashed in the capital. We can't let that happen."

"Then we will too!"

"Someone who's never hunted monsters shouldn't be saying that!"

Certainly, wolves, bears, and even the mightiest monsters like tigers and lions are no match for it. However...

BOOOOM!!!

When I showered Kurt with explosive magic, his already injured right arm was blown into pieces.

"Just as I thought... This guy isn't that big of a deal, huh?"

I felt a sense of discomfort while battling the transformed Majin, Kurt.

He's too weak.

I heard about a Majin in the past that nearly destroyed the country. However, this guy is undoubtedly strong but not to the point of inducing despair.

Is it even so easy for someone to transform into a Majin?

Discomfort.

There is too much discomfort in this whole incident. What's going on?

"Aaaahhhhhhh!"

This is bad! He's increased his magic power even further!

Magic power started swirling within Kurt. Is he planning to self-destruct?

If he unleashes this much magic power, the entire area will be obliterated!

I have to stop him here... This is bad!

"Kaaart!!"

I charge into Kurt and slash the Vibrationsword toward his neck.

Zan!

After swinging the Vibrationsword, I step back, preparing for a possible explosion.

As I watch Kurt, who has come to a halt...

His head drops to the ground with a thud, and his body collapses.

Thud.

I confirm that the surging magic power has dissipated, and Kurt's body won't move anymore.

"Haahhh..."

I breathe out heavily. I'm looking at Kurt's lifeless body.

Come to think of it, this is the first time I've killed a person... Well, he was a Majin, but... I don't feel any guilt...

Is it because I've hunted animals in the forest so many times? Have I become accustomed to the act of taking life?

As I contemplate these complex emotions while gazing at Kurt's lifeless body...

"Shin!"

Cecily rushes towards me.

"Shin! Are you okay? Do you have any injuries?"

Cecily asks while patting my body.

Og and the others also arrive, so I ask Og, "Did you guys not evacuate?"

"Well, we did leave the grounds, but when we heard a loud noise immediately... we turned around and saw..."

Og trails off and looks at Kurt.

"...You started overwhelming the Majin, and as I watched in astonishment, you just defeated it..."

Looking around, I could see that everyone had mixed expressions.

"But still... I can't believe it even now. When Kurt transformed into a Majin, I thought it was all over."

"I was also prepared for death."

"Walford, that was amazing."

"Yeah, right? What was that? Your magic was incredible, but you also cleanly severed the Majin's arm with your sword!"

"That was a beautifully executed swordplay. Are you aiming for the top spot at the Knight Academy?"

"That's right. I've never seen such a perfect swordplay, not even from my father or my brother."

"Walford, you're an incredible person after all?"

I guess the tension had finally dissipated, and they all started talking. Among them, Og was the only one who remained silent.

"Og, what's wrong?"

"Hm? Oh, I was just thinking that things are going to get tough from here."

"What do you mean?"

"Don't you realize? A Majin appeared."

"Oh... right."

"This marks the second appearance of a Majin in history. Just that alone could bring great calamity to the country. And to handle it so easily, and..."

While Og was speaking, it seemed that he was called by the students â€“ knights, soldiers, and mages had gathered.

"Your Highness Augustus! Are you safe?"

"We received reports of a Majin appearing! Where is the Majin?"

"We are willing to put our lives on the line to repel the Majin. Where is it?"

"Yes, it's over there, lying down."

"Lying down?"

They turned to look in the direction Og pointed.

There, they saw the lifeless body of Kurt, his head severed.

"You don't mean... you defeated the Majin?"

"Yes, but not me."

Saying that, they turned their gaze toward me.

"A student from this magic academy did this?"

"What do you mean by 'a student'? His name is Shin Walford. He's the grandson of the Majin-slaying hero, Merlin Walford."

"The grandson of Sage Merlin?"

With those words exchanged, more students who had come to check on the situation gathered around.

"Don't gather in a dangerous place! The military personnel came to check the situation, but your lack of crisis awareness is astonishing!"

"Hey! Isn't that the Majin lying over there?"

"Huh? You've got to be kidding!"

"Did he already defeat the Majin?"

"What? What happened?"

Ignoring my inner frustration, everyone started talking, paying no heed to it. Both the military personnel and the students looked at Og.

"Everyone, rest assured! The Majin was defeated by Shin Walford, the grandson of the hero and sage, Merlin Walford!"

I shouted loudly to inform everyone. For a moment, silence descended in the surroundings, and then...

"Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!"

Cheers erupted.

"No way!? Seriously!?"

"Amazing! Just as expected from the Sage's grandson!"

"A hero! A new hero!"

"The Sage's grandson, Shin Walford!"

"Shin!" "Shin!" "Shin!"

Shin chants started. Stop it! It's embarrassing. Don't shout my name loudly like that!

I wanted to escape, but I couldn't get away since the knights and mages around me crowded in.

"Well done! You did great!"

"Indeed, the hero's grandson is a hero too!"

"Fantastic! Fantastic, Shin!"

Please, just stop it! Making a commotion is one thing, but it's even more unbearable when they make such a fuss over defeating a Majin of that caliber.

"I knew it would turn out like this."

So, this is what Og was going to say earlier! I never imagined it would turn into such a spectacle.

While everyone around me celebrated the incident, I couldn't quite share their excitement. I watched them as if it were happening to someone else, trying to figure out the source of my unease.

In the end, due to this commotion, the research society's explanatory session was canceled, and we were told to return to the classroom for now.

"Shin, what's wrong?"

Cecily asked me.

"Indeed, Shin, your behavior has been strange since earlier."

"No... from the beginning to the end of this incident, it's just been unsettling."

"Unsettling?"

"Yeah, let's continue this in the classroom."

When we returned to the classroom, Professor Alfred greeted us.

"Oh! You all! I was worried! Especially you, Walford. Are you injured?"

"Yes, I'm fine."

"I see... that's a relief."

He asked with genuine concern. He's a good teacher, and it's clear that he's genuinely worried about us.

"But Shin, what was that about earlier? I felt uneasy about Kurt's actions as well, but what do you mean by 'to the end'?"

Right, I should explain that.

"First, I'm sure everyone has noticed the inconsistency in Kurt's behavior. Flaunting one's social status isn't exclusive to this place; it's a prohibited act in all three major high-level academies, and every citizen of this country should know that. Despite that, Kurt acted as if he could wield his authority. It was an attempted act of defiance. If I hadn't resisted and been there, there's no doubt he would have taken action against Cecily."

Everyone nodded.

"And, despite being cautioned by Og, he attempted a similar act a second time. Normally, when someone flaunts their nobility to such an extent, it means they have a strong sense of pride in their status or believe their status is absolute. So, why couldn't he heed the words of Og, a person nearly at the pinnacle of society?"

All eyes turned to Og, who shrugged.

"I think this is the unease that everyone has been feeling. And now, here's the unease I felt today."

I could see everyone holding their breath, waiting for my words.

"First, why did Kurt appear at that location? Wasn't he supposed to be on house arrest? Furthermore, it was at the request of the Ritzberg family. Why was he allowed to leave so easily?"

"I also wondered about that."

"I thought he wasn't here, so I didn't move."

"And... after that, he transformed into a Majin."

I looked around at everyone.

"Is it so easy to become a Majin?"

Puzzlement was evident on everyone's faces. Professor Alfred had wide-open eyes.

"Indeed... it's definitely strange."

Professor Alfred seemed to have realized something.

"Eh... What do you mean?"

"In the past, it's said that the wizards who transformed into Majin were high-ranking wizards who had trained for years and reached the pinnacle of magic. Those wizards failed to perform an extremely high-level spell and ended up becoming Majin."

After explaining up to this point, it seemed like everyone understood.

"Ritzberg has just entered the Advanced Magic Academy. Even if he had failed to control his magic, it should have resulted in nothing more than a magic explosion. I've never heard of anyone transforming into a Majin."

"That's true. If you can become a Majin just from a magic control failure, we'd be overrun by Majin by now."

"That doesn't make sense."

"Certainly. Magic explosions of that degree are quite common. I've experienced it myself."

"Lynn, be careful! Magic explosions can blow everything around!"

"Yeah, I'll be more careful from now on."

Sigh... honestly.

"So, here's the thing. We only know of one reported incident of a Majin. Humans had never transformed into Majin before then, to the extent that it was thought impossible. So why did he become a Majin so easily?"

"Why is that?"

"I have no idea."

"What!?"

It seemed that Og had thought of something.

"What is it, Your Highness?"

Og had apparently come up with a hypothesis.

"No... it can't be..."

"Og, I think your imagination matches mine."

"That can't be true!"

"Artificial... that's a possibility."

"Nonsense! Are you saying they can artificially create Majin?"

Professor Alfred shouted. Indeed, it sounded unbelievable, but...

"Well, it's just a theory, and I have no idea how it could be done in practice. But the possibility isn't zero. I became more convinced of it after the battle."

"After the battle?"

"My grandfather used to tell me stories about when he defeated a Majin."

"To hear the story of a Majin's defeat from the Sage himself..."

"I'm so jealous!"

Their reactions were unusual.

"No... not there. I heard stories about Majin from the person who had actually defeated one. Majin completely lose their reason, only howl, and they can't speak a word. But when Kurt transformed into a Majin... he spoke."

"Does that mean... he didn't transform into a Majin?"

"No, there's no doubt he transformed into a Majin... a magical beast. It had all the characteristics: ominous magical power, blood-red eyes, and becoming more aggressive. These are common features among magical beasts."

As the students listened in silence, I continued.

"When I fought him, I found him to be remarkably weak. It was quite different from what my grandfather had told me. Is this the same as the Majin my grandfather fought? Or is it something else?"

"Being weak as a Majin..."

"No, I think he was quite strong..."

"To be honest, in terms of strength, it's a bit stronger than tiger and lion magical beasts."

"Tigers and lions..."

"More than enough to be utterly hopeless..."

Students might think so, but I doubt the Knights or the Magic Society members would. Thinking that, I looked at Professor Alfred.

"Lions... I encountered one once in the past, and at that time, I thought I was going to die, that it was all over... I kept thinking that over and over. I still have nightmares about it."

Huh? Is this at the trauma level?

"Well, anyway, it doesn't mean that defeating it is impossible, right?"

"... Yes."

"In the past, Majin almost destroyed the country. Several towns and villages were actually wiped out. Can tiger and lion magical beasts achieve that?"

"No... it's not possible to that extent."

"Easily becoming a Majin, being so weak, and retaining some level of consciousness... considering these factors..."

Everyone was waiting for my words.

"I... I think that Kurt might have been used for human experimentation."

"Human experimentation!?"

"So... it might be artificial?"

"It's just a theory. But I think the possibility is high."

"I see... That's why Shin looks so conflicted; it's hard to be happy about this."

It's just a theory, but if it were true... someone's malicious intent would be behind it. Who that someone is and for what purpose, we have no idea.

I think everyone felt that. They all had somewhat anxious expressions.

From a building slightly away from the Advanced Magic Academy, there was someone observing the academy from above. It was Oliver Strom, Kurt's former teacher.

"Hmm, Kurt transformed into a magical beast. But perhaps it's because his original abilities were low. It's quite limited. Well, let's consider the experiment a success."

He said that and chuckled softly.

"But anyway, Waldford. I hope he doesn't become a troublesome presence."

As he mumbled that, he disappeared from the spot.

No one noticed his presence.
