The day after somehow avoiding Shaolin's intense questioning that made me break into a cold sweat, we once again became inhabitants of the sky.

The atmosphere at breakfast that morning was quite awkward. Shaolin and the others avoided eye contact with us, and Aug scrutinized the two with his gaze.

But last night was undoubtedly the biggest crisis in my life... I thought my heart had stopped when Tony suggested that I might have memories from a past life.

Well, he seemed to have misunderstood things somehow and it ended up getting smoothed over, so I'll let that slide. Besides, it's better to keep the fact that I have memories from a past life a secret. The hypothesis I came across before is that there's a low probability that memories from a past life will return if you miraculously survive during your infancy. We absolutely can't let that be known, as there will inevitably be inhumane actions taken by some individuals if it is revealed.

As I reaffirmed that, Navar approached.

"Lord Demon King, what were you trying to do yesterday? There seems to be some tension between you and those two."

I see, so Navar and the others saw that something was going on yesterday. However, they didn't overhear our conversation.

"Well, it's a bit complicated... details."

"I see. Too bad, but I won't dig deeper, so as not to stir up any snakes in the grass."

"I'm sorry."

"No, no."

It seems that Navar is still strongly influenced by Grandma's authority. But even so, she hasn't managed to distance herself from Grandma at all.

While having this conversation, we continued our journey in the sky, but today, Shaolin and Lifan didn't engage in any conversation and stayed away from our group. It seems that they are still quite uncomfortable due to the events of yesterday.

From time to time, they discreetly glanced at me and Cecily, clearly checking our reactions. Cecily seemed to notice this as well and would occasionally give me a wry smile.

There's no need to worry so much; human lives should be the top priority. I don't intend to go back on that promise now. Furthermore, Shaolin's older sister is suffering from a uterine disease this time.

Becoming a parent to Silver has truly made me feel the happiness of having a child.

Having a child implies that her sister has a husband. It's undoubtedly hard to come to terms with that fact. So, I genuinely want to do everything I can.

Oh, by the way.

"Shaolin."

"Huh! Uh, yes?"

I suddenly spoke to her, and her response was somewhat strange.

"...You don't need to be so cautious. We will ensure your sister receives proper treatment. However, I have something I'd like to ask."

"Yes, what is it?"

"What is Shaolin's sister's husband like?"

"You mean my brother-in-law?"

"Yes. Well, I don't think it's particularly relevant to the current situation, but I'm curious."

"I see..."

With that, Shaolin thought for a moment and began to speak.

"Truthfully, my brother-in-law is a somewhat unreliable person."

"That's quite... blunt."

"But it's the truth. When my sister fell ill, he was at a loss and couldn't even arrange for a healer."

"That's surprising. I thought that with a capable merchant sister, her husband would be sharp and competent as well."

"She handles everything herself, it seems. She was looking for comfort from my brother-in-law, and he's actually a younger, cute type of person."

"Is that so? Well, I'm sorry for prying into personal matters."

"No, I... I was quite rude to you yesterday, so..."

"I don't hold that against you; don't worry about it. More importantly, aren't we there yet?"

"Huh? Well..."

Shaolin said this and looked out the window. It seems she had been too preoccupied with trying to gauge our reactions and hadn't had the chance to look outside.

She's still quite concerned about what happened yesterday.

While she was looking outside, Shaolin suddenly exclaimed, "Ah!"

"What is it? An ancient ruin!"

"Huh? An ancient ruin?"

Reacting more to the word "ancient ruin" than to Shaolin's statement that we were arriving soon, we all looked out the window at once.

And there, we found it.

"Is that an ancient ruin? It's a rather peculiar structure."

"From here, it looks like blocks. However, considering how high we're flying, it must be much larger in reality."

Maria and Thor, seeing an ancient ruin from a past civilization for the first time, shared their thoughts.

In response, Shaolin provided some explanation.

"It's large indeed. But the strange thing is, that building has no seams. It's as if it was carved out of a massive stone."

"I see."

Lin also responded with interest, but I couldn't focus on that. Because...

(No seams? That's like concrete...)

The kanji characters, guns, concrete.

What they symbolized.

(Civilization from Earth!?)

The ancient ruins below, no matter how you looked at them, resembled concrete buildings.

As I gazed at the building, one thought wouldn't leave my mind.

It was...

(Could it be... that someone from a previous civilization regained their memories from a past life? And that person... was either Japanese or Chinese and, unlike me and Masita, had no restraint in spreading civilization?)

That was the only plausible explanation.

Since I hadn't actually seen the characters on the magical tool, I couldn't be sure if the person was Japanese or Chinese.

Perhaps it could even be Taiwan or Hong Kong.

The countries within the cultural sphere using the kanji characters I could think of at the moment.

However, there was no doubt that someone like that existed.

And when I contemplated that possibility, it sent shivers down my spine.

Within this ruin, magical tools lay dormant.

Moreover, based on the buildings below and the magical tool Shaolin possessed, they were of a civilization level similar to the one I lived in during my time.

And these magical tools could still be functional.

If, within them, weapons of mass destruction were discovered...

"This might become a really serious situation..."

Despite our top priority being the treatment of Shaolin's sister, I couldn't help but feel uneasy about everything else.

"Really. This one will surely break some hearts in the future."

"So, what's the talk about?"

"Well, you see..."

As the people from Els praised Silver one after another, Og began to explain the situation.

I thought they would probably refuse, but the response we received was unexpected.

"It's a request from the Archmage!? We'll definitely accept that!!"

"Huh?"

They accepted without hesitation?

Huh? Why?

"Of course, the Archmage is one of the Heroes. Furthermore, he's the mentor of our president. How could we ignore a request from someone like that!"

I see.

But Grandma's influence is really something.

Well, I guess it's only natural from the perspective of the people from Els.

After all, he introduced magical tools for daily life to the public and is revered as a hero in business.

I thought so, but...

"...I've been hearing stories from the president... It's not something you can go against when it's the Archmage..."

They don't revere him; they fear him...Dom√≠ngueza database schema

The maximum number of requests you can make in an hour can vary depending on the specific service or API you are using. Many online services and APIs impose rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. These rate limits can vary widely from one service to another and may depend on factors such as your account type, subscription level, or the specific API endpoints you are using.

To find out the rate limits for a particular service or API, you should consult their documentation or terms of service. These documents typically outline the rate limits, usage policies, and any associated costs for exceeding those limits. Additionally, you may need to authenticate or use API keys to track your usage and adhere to rate limits.

It's important to respect the rate limits set by the service or API you are using to avoid being blocked or having your access restricted due to excessive requests. Violating rate limits can lead to service disruptions and, in some cases, may result in additional charges or the suspension of your account.

The rate limits for accessing ChatGPT are typically determined by the platform or service through which you access it, rather than ChatGPT itself. For example, if you are using an API provided by a service like OpenAI to access ChatGPT, they may have specific rate limits and usage policies.

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, OpenAI had rate limits in place for their API, which could vary depending on your subscription or access level. These rate limits could include limits on requests per minute, requests per day, or requests per month.

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding rate limits for ChatGPT, you should check OpenAI's official documentation or contact their support team or check their website for the latest information, as these policies may have evolved since my last update. It's important to adhere to the rate limits to ensure smooth and uninterrupted access to the service.

I apologize for any confusion, but I don't have access to real-time usage data or the ability to monitor the number of requests you make in an hour. The message you receive when making too many requests to a service or API will depend on the specific platform or service you are using to access ChatGPT.

If you're encountering rate limits or usage restrictions, you should refer to the documentation or support resources provided by the platform or service you're using for information on how to handle such issues or increase your rate limits if needed.orm content ideas
