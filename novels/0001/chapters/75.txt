After encountering monsters for the first time, we were able to advance as planned to the vicinity of the former imperial border, with no monsters appearing.

Today, we are camping here.

With a group of this size gathered, it seems like monsters might come close, but they won't approach the camp because magical devices have been set up on the outskirts of the camp. By the way, these devices are called "monster repellent magical tools," but in reality, they are magical barriers that block magical power. They are in the form of cords encircling the camp, and they make the magical power within the enclosed area undetectable to monsters. Just by not leaking magical power outside, it seems that monsters rarely appear. They are not in constant operation, so they need to activate the magical devices in shifts during the night. It's not a complete guarantee, hence the need for lookouts.

Come to think of it, this kind of camping is a first for me.

As I was feeling a bit excited, someone approached and spoke.

"Excuse me. The preparations for the camp for the envoys, the saint, and the valkyrie are complete."

Since the previous battle, Maria had been referred to as the "valkyrie." She was not used to being called that, and each time it happened, she would squirm in embarrassment.

Well, she'd probably get used to it eventually. Ignoring the squirming Maria, I followed the soldier who had come to get us and arrived at the tents set up for our camp.

There were two-person tents and one-person tents, and we were told to sleep in them.

"Well then, this is the tent for the envoys and the saint, and this one is for the valkyrie."

"Huh?"

"Huh?"

Wait a minute! Are you telling me that men and women are supposed to share the same tent in a war zone?

Certainly, Sicily is my fianc√©e, but there's no way we can share the same tent in a situation like this!

"And, um... since there are many single people here... if possible, could you use a soundproof magical tool or a barrier..."

"Are you suggesting we do that in this situation? I mean, can we even share the same tent?"

"Huh? Is that so?"

"Yes, it is!"

What are you even thinking!?

"You mentioned it earlier, didn't you? That there are many single people here. In such a situation, even if you're engaged, sharing the same tent would cause a lot of resentment, wouldn't it?"

"That's true."

They easily agreed!

People entering the bath are supposed to channel mana for a few minutes and gradually add hot water, as part of the etiquette.

It seems like they collect moisture from the air and convert it into water, which circulates endlessly within the tent.

Using soap that naturally decomposes, they wash their bodies and hair, then add mana to the hot water from the magical device before getting into the bathtub.

"Sigh..."

I noticed this after traveling in a carriage to Sicily's family home, but you tend to accumulate fatigue after long-distance travel. Maintaining the marching pace and helping the soldiers recover their strength, I think baths are important for various reasons.

"Thank you for your hard work, Your Excellency. Is the water temperature to your liking?"

"No... I'd prefer not to be called 'Your Excellency'... but the water temperature is fine."

"Hehe. By the way, it was your grandmother who developed this magical device, wasn't it, Your Excellency? My apologies for the foolish question."

The soldier who had been guiding us since earlier joined us in the bath. It seemed he had no intention of correcting the way he addressed me.

It's become a bit troublesome.

"By the way, that valkyrie's magic from earlier was amazing. Could it be that all the Ultimate Magicians can use magic like that?"

"Well, Maria was originally... uh, Augustus... His Highness Augustus's second in command, so she was quite skilled. I wonder if the others can do something similar now?"

"Uh, something similar... you say..."

"Some are more skilled in healing magic like Sicily, while others are adept in close combat or body enhancement magic."

Through practicing precision magic, Sicily's offensive magic had improved significantly. It wouldn't be an overstatement to say that everyone could use similar levels of offensive magic.

Then, people who had been eavesdropping around us began to voice their thoughts.

"Is everyone at that level?"

"Huh? The saint can use offensive magic to that extent too?"

"Even with that much magic, there are people doing close combat..."

"...Are we needed for this mission?"

Oops, now everyone is starting to question their significance.

I should provide some reassurance.

"Of course, your abilities are indispensable. If we were to carry out this mission on our own, it could take several months... or even years. We can't afford to keep the people in anxiety for such a long period. For a swift resolution, your contributions are absolutely necessary."

"However, as public bathing using the hot water magical devices became widespread, it seems that, conversely, the value of hot springs has increased. Hot springs, heated by geothermal energy, gush up from underground water sources, and they contain various minerals and offer various therapeutic effects."

With the increase in the popularity of bathing, people started to notice the appeal of hot springs, which in turn raised their value.

"When you think about it, it was your grandmother who increased our value."

"Grandmother? ...Oh, right, the saint is the grandchild of the archbishop and engaged to the envoy, correct?"

"Yes."

Perhaps because it had been a while since their engagement, Sicily answered without much embarrassment.

"By the way, I read 'The New Heroic Tale.' Is what's written there about the saint being rescued by the envoy how you two first met?"

"Uh... y-yes, that's right..."

It seems she's still not quite used to it. She started to blush when asked about how they first met.

And with that, conversations about love began, drawing in the female soldiers nearby.

"Saint, which part of the envoy do you like?"

"W-which part... I just realized I liked him..."

The female soldiers erupted in response to Sicily's answer.

"Then, then! What's the envoy like?"

"Well... he's strong, cool, considerate of his family and friends, and... kind..."

Once again, the female soldiers were all excited.

"What about the valkyrie? Do you have a similar impression of the valkyrie?"

"The valkyrie... well, it's not entirely inaccurate."

"So, what about the valkyrie's feelings for the envoy?"

"No way."

Maria replied immediately, leaving everyone looking surprised.

"True, if that's all there is to it, there might be girls within the same team who could fall for Shin, but..."

Is there something more? The female soldiers eagerly awaited Maria's words.

"After all, he's so clueless, so lacking in self-restraint... Shin's ideas of normality often deviate from our common sense. He's a walking troublemaker, and I can't handle being around him."

"Mm... no need to put it that way..."

"You're head over heels for Shin, so maybe you can tolerate those quirks, but we..."

The female soldiers seemed puzzled by the unexpected description of Shin, which differed from the general public's perception.

During training sessions, I intentionally gathered magical energy to summon monsters.

I've been practicing magic control daily since I was a child, so my baseline magical energy capacity has grown significantly.

So, that means...

"Until now, all those monster appearances were...?"

"First and foremost, it's undoubtedly your fault."

"...Seriously?"

"Unfortunately, it's true."

"Without you, it's pretty peaceful here, despite it being a march for hunting monsters!"

"Right. This is what normality feels like... but..."

"It was quite tough over here... monsters kept appearing in large numbers, and Maria started being called a 'valkyrie.'"

"Hey! You don't have to report that!"

"Oh? It seems like something fun is happening over there."

"It's not fun!"

"Still, over where Shin is, all three of you have gotten nicknames. I'm envious."

"It's not as great as you think... it's embarrassing."

In the end, that day was mostly about reporting the monster situation, followed by casual conversation.

After bidding goodnight to the two of them, I returned to my own tent.

The commander's tent, where strategic meetings sometimes took place, was quite large in size. Within that tent, Ralph and other members opposed to having an envoy and saint had gathered, wearing grim expressions.

"Lord Ralph... can we really defeat that? Moreover, it seems that the one who cast that magic wasn't Shin Wolford, right?"

"The team members unleashed that level of power. How much magic can the representative guy cast..."

The opposition, who had witnessed Maria's magic, were starting to think that it might be impossible to win against her.

In this situation, albeit reluctantly, they might have no choice but to accept that title they had been opposing.

Gradually, they were beginning to accept it.

Most of the opposition had started giving up on convincing Shin to retract his envoy declaration, but Ralph was the exception. He was just too earnest.

He was too earnest to adapt to things as flexibly as the others.

The power might be subtle, but when a large group simultaneously casts magic, it looks incredibly impressive.

After the magic corps unleashed their magic, it was the turn of the knights and soldiers to charge into the horde of monsters.

Indeed, they were the regular army of the nation. When it came to medium-sized monsters, some individuals could handle them solo.

Even large monsters were dealt with easily when tackled by a group.

"It's amazing. Maybe we won't have a chance to participate?"

"If you keep saying things like that..."

"Oh, here it is."

"..."

"It's not my fault, is it!?"

As soon as I said that, it happened.

With monstrous levels of magic power, it was clear that a disaster-class monster had appeared.

"Disaster-class monster sighting! All personnel, quickly retreat! Do not allow the minor players to get close to the envoys!"

"Ooooh!"

What emerged was a super-sized wolf.

It looked like something you might find in a 'Whatever' Forest.

Normally, wolves were classified as medium-sized, but when they turned into monsters and absorbed magic power over time, they gradually grew in size, potentially reaching disaster-class status.

While lions and tigers became disaster-class monsters as soon as they transformed into monsters, the ones who reached disaster-class status over time, like wolves, were often cunning individuals.

This was getting troublesome...

"Sicily, Maria. This is your first encounter with a disaster-class wolf, right?"

"Yes..."

"I've never seen one..."

"They're extremely fast. So, it would be great if you could hold it back."

"Understood!"

"...As usual, you've dealt with something like this before, haven't you?"

Well, that was the case.

I could defeat it, but it was a hassle.

So, I had the two of them provide support.

I explained to them how to support me and then took out my vibration sword before charging straight ahead.

"What!? Envoy, that's reckless!"

A soldier who was observing the battle was surprised, but it wasn't reckless!

The wolf, which had sidestepped to avoid my direct charge...

"Gyahh! Gaaaah!"

The wolf's movements had perfectly matched the magic cast by Sicily and Maria, who had instructed to cast spells "on both sides" of the wolf as it sidestepped. It was hit by Sicily's ice spear and writhed in pain.

I couldn't let this opportunity slip by, so I activated my jet boots and closed in on the wolf.

Clang!

The wolf managed to bite the part of my vibration sword's blade expertly.

It had to be a coincidence, right?!

The part of the blade that is vibrating is, of course, not sharp, so the sword came to a stop.

"Oh! Shin!"

Sicily shouted in panic, but with the wolf still biting the vibration sword, it couldn't move without getting injured.

For a moment, there was a deadlock...

I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf.

I can use not only the sword but also magic.

I fired high-temperature flame magic from the slight opening in the wolf's jaws where the vibration sword was being bitten.

"Gyaaaaa!"

The ultra-high-temperature flames entering its mouth burned through the wolf's body, quickly leading to its demise.

...Huh?

I thought that a disaster-class wolf, upon sensing magic, would release the sword and create some distance...

It took the hit head-on...

"Shin, you're quite ruthless..."

"Hm? Oh, I was just trying to distract it because we were in a deadlock."

"It went straight into its mouth, though..."

Well, in any case, the disaster-class monster was defeated.

"This is amazing! He annihilated a disaster-class wolf in an instant!"

"Don't fall behind the envoy! Let us show our strength!"

"Ooooh!"

Having defeated the disaster-class monster, the soldiers' morale skyrocketed.

With this, the monster subjugation would proceed smoothly.

I feel a bit uneasy, though...

I hope everyone else is okay.
