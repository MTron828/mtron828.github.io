The text you provided appears to be in Japanese. Here is the English translation:

"Eka is the head of state of the Holy Easian Kingdom and the Pope of the Church of Creation. Thanks to her speech, Shin became the officially recognized 'Messenger of God' in the Church of Creation.

After hearing that speech, two individuals are feeling anger and disappointment.

One of them is Ralph, who opposed placing Shin at the center of the military strategy during a cabinet meeting.

And then, there is another person...

"That little girl... She really did it, huh?"

This person is Merida, who was in Earlsheid and heard the speech of Pope Eka. Merlin and Merida do not approve of using Shin's extraordinary powers for political purposes. However, they are facing an emergency situation with the mass emergence of demons.

In such times, they have no intention of not relying on Shin's power. Moreover, Shin has a clear will to save the world. So Merida can understand the desire to strategically rely on Shin.

Therefore, Merida did not object to Shin being gradually elevated as a hero, and she did not oppose publishing stories based on Shin.

However, this time is different.

Pope Eka is essentially the world's top figure as the Pope of the Church of Creation.

The fact that the Pope declared to the entire alliance that Shin is the Messenger of God is a significant declaration.

As a result of this declaration, some may come to recognize Shin as an important figure in the Church of Creation.

If that happens, there may be those who seek to politically exploit Shin.

For Merlin and Merida, this is the most intolerable outcome.

"Hehe... I guess I need to apply a little moxibustion to this..."

Anger seemed to have reached its peak, and Merida began to laugh. Julia, May, and Elizabeth, who were watching the declaration at the mobilization ceremony venue in Earlsheid, had tense expressions.

"Merida-sama, this is scary..."

"Hush! May, what will you do if she hears you?"

May was terrified by Merida's behavior, which she had never seen before, and Elizabeth was worried that Merida might have overheard.

"I'm sorry, but I have a little business to attend to. I'll take my leave."

"Um... Could you please do it in moderation?"

Anticipating the events that are about to unfold, Julia makes a request to Merida..."

I see, I've heard of it before. Pope Ekaterina, during her childhood, left the Holy Easian Kingdom and traveled to various countries with a certain party.

And then, her journey came to an end, and the young Ekaterina, who had returned to Eas, had acquired extraordinary powers that set her apart from others and was called a saint.

I believe that party was...

"Why, why, why are you here, Master?"

"Of course, it's because I heard your ridiculous speech, right!?"

Yes, it was supposed to be the party of the sage Merlin and the guide Merida.

Ekaterina, who revered Merlin as her master, and the guide Merida, who was called a hero around the world.

The legends were right in front of them.

And she seemed quite angry.

With that intensity, the guards couldn't even move, and they gulped audibly.

Gochin!

"Ouch!"

With everyone unable to move and only able to watch Merida's actions, Merida approached Ekaterina and struck her with a fist.

"What are you doing!?"

"What are you doing? You used my grandson for something like this! Are you prepared for the consequences!?"

"Well, I..."

Ekaterina knew that Shin had been raised as the grandson of Merlin and Merida. She knew it, but this was an emergency. She beseeched Diethem to explain, turning her face towards him, hoping that Merida would understand.

...

Diethem turned his face away with a "hmph."

"Hey, brother, that's harsh!"

The fact that Diethem had traveled with Merlin and Merida meant he had traveled with Diethem too. Ekaterina still called him "brother." It had continued from the past, and she still used it in private. By the way, she called Julia "sister."

Feeling betrayed by her "brother," Ekaterina wore a face of despair.

"Uh, it's been a while, Master. Well, isn't it about time to forgive and forget?"

"Huh!?"

"Ugh!"

"Well, well, what's this, young lad?"

"Well, it's not like that, Master. You can't call a man in his forties a young lad, can you?"

"You'll always be a young lad. Or is there something else you're saying? That you should respect yourself as the President of Els?"

"Ka, it's impossible... You haven't changed at all, Master."

The President of the Els Free Trade Union, Aaron Zenith, whom Merida has been calling "young lad" since earlier, was also a former companion of Merlin's during his youth. He used to travel as a merchant to various countries but was once attacked by monsters during his journey, narrowly escaping thanks to Merlin's help. In return, Zenith, who had been traveling as a merchant, offered guidance and negotiated the sale of materials from the monsters they hunted on their journey at a high price, earning money for the party's expenses.

He also called Merida "master" because she had taught him the art of negotiation, and when he left the party to pursue an independent career, he was given the rights to some of the magical tools developed by Merida. With these magical tools as capital, he started his own business and quickly rose to become a major businessman, eventually becoming the President.

As a result, he had a great deal of respect for Merida. Despite being in his forties, he maintained a well-toned physique and a rugged face, making it difficult to believe his age. In front of Merida, he was extremely humble.

For the people from Els, who should have found the President to be strict but reliable, they couldn't hide their confusion at his pitiful appearance.

"Diethem."

"Yes!"

"Why didn't you stop her?"

"Well, uh... that is..."

Diethem stumbled over his words, unable to respond, under Merida's intense gaze.

As the oldest of the three disciples who had known Merida the longest, he could sense how angry she was, and his body had tensed up. Seeing Diethem in this state, Merida...

"Kneel."

"Huh?"

"Kneel!"

"Yes, yes, yes!"

Even Zenith, who had no business being involved in this matter, found himself kneeling under Merida's stern command.

"Now... young lady."

"Yes!"

"Have you read Shin's book?"

"Yes."

"Did it not say there that using Shin for military or political purposes is unacceptable? How do you justify your actions? It's clearly political exploitation, isn't it?"

"Well..."

"Shin's extraordinary power can be used for the benefit of humanity, and I don't oppose that. But this is different, isn't it?"

"Yes..."

Merida reprimanded Ekaterina for using Shin as a political tool, emphasizing that while it's okay to use Shin's power for world peace, carrying him as if he were a sacred object amounts to political exploitation.

Ekaterina, reprimanded by Merida, hung her head in dejection.

"Diethem."

"Yes!"

"Why didn't you stop her?"

"Well, uh... I thought that if Shin was recognized as the Messenger, people would consider him a friend of humanity..."

"It's nice that you think of Shin that way, but didn't you consider the consequences when the young lady made that declaration?"

"...I'm sorry. With this, Shin won't be considered an enemy to humanity, and that's the only..."

"I see. Diethem, that's fine. You will prove that Shin has no connection with Eas or the Church of Creation, all right?"

"Yes... I'm sorry."

Diethem, who hadn't realized that his actions, meant for Shin's benefit, could lead to misunderstandings, also hung his head in dejection.

"Aaron."

"Yes!"

"...Why are you kneeling?"

"Well... uh, it's just an old habit, I ended up kneeling."

He must have been scolded severely in the past. Zenith found himself kneeling reflexively.

"You guys are truly... you never stop being a handful."

"All right..."

Observing this scene, Merlin, who usually maintained a calm demeanor and tried not to provoke Merida's anger, watched in astonishment.

"...Without a doubt, Merida is the Godmother of this world..."

"Did you say something?"

"No, no! It's nothing."

Even the leaders of the three major nations couldn't stand up to Merida. Considering this, Merlin, who remained unfazed even when scolded by her, appeared to be quite the important figure.

And then, there was Ralph, who couldn't hide his disappointment with Pope Ekaterina's statement. He was traveling in a carriage on his way to the battlefield.

He held the position of the Chief of the Military in the Darm Kingdom. In the Darm Kingdom, where the Church of Creation had deep roots and most of the population were devout followers of the Church, Ralph was known for his piety and upright character, earning the trust of the people and the king.

However, his behavior at the recent cabinet meeting had caused a stir in the Darm Kingdom. Ralph had refused Shin Wolford's participation in the operation. This meeting was so crucial that all the proceedings had been made public, given that it was not an exaggeration to say that the fate of the world hinged on it.

In the minutes of the meeting, it was revealed that Ralph had opposed placing Shin at the center of the subjugation operation.

Among the public, it was already known that Shin had defeated the Demon Beasts twice and eliminated nearly half of them. To advise excluding Shin Wolford, who could be considered humanity's hope, from the operation...

What had happened to General Ralph?

Did he have some kind of conflict with Shin Wolford?

Rumors spread like wildfire among the people of the Darm Kingdom. Ralph, who had become the subject of gossip among the people, was riding in a carriage with like-minded individuals.

"What is this... The Holy Pope herself acknowledges Shin Wolford as the 'Messenger of God'..."

"General Portman, I can't stand it! Even though he's not even a follower of the Church of Creation, he's being praised as the 'Messenger of God,' and to make matters worse, isn't it true that the Holy Pope herself is going to officiate his wedding ceremony? Who does he think he is? This Shin Wolford!"

A minority within the Church of Creation, the military men who could not accept Shin as the 'Messenger of God' and Cecily as the 'Holy Maiden,' were raising their voices in anger.

The individuals riding in the carriage were all criticizing Shin, who had received official recognition as the 'Messenger of God,' but Shin had not requested any of this, and the wedding ceremony was conducted by the Archbishop Macena and the recognition as the 'Messenger of God' was the sole decision of Pope Ekaterina. As a result, they had to face Merida's wrath...

Without mentioning any of these facts, all their blame was directed towards Shin, who accepted these without reservations.

All of them were devout followers of the Church of Creation.

In a religion that worshiped the Creator God who had created this world, performed good deeds, and aimed to be guided to God's presence after death, those who were considered to be sent from the presence of God should be honored.

However, the person who was considered the 'Messenger of God' from God's presence was not a follower of the Church of Creation.

The 'Messenger of God' who was supposed to be sent from God's presence being irreligious... what kind of joke was this?

Originally, this was the reason they opposed calling Shin the 'Messenger of God,' but it was also revealed that he had a frivolous personality that drew lots like in a game during battles.

There was no way they could accept someone like that. This was their claim.

By the way, the reason they cannot accept Cecily as the Holy Maiden is that she is a follower of the Church of Creation but not a clergy member.

The current Pope is opposed to non-clergy members assuming titles given after their clerical training.

"...We should present our achievements and show Pope Ekaterina that Shin Wolford and the others are unnecessary, that they are mere illusions."

"Indeed, Lord Ralph. Fortunately, Shin Wolford and Cecily von Claude have been dispatched to our country. This is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate that they have not achieved greater merits than us."

"Hmm. At first, I was disappointed to learn that they would be the ones dispatched as Ultimate Magicians... but this might be God's guidance."

"Yes, which means God is showing us His mercy!"

"Hehe, that's right. Shin Wolford, I won't let you have it your way."

Opponents who believe that if they achieve greater merits than Shin, it will prove that Shin is not the Messenger of God.

Pope Ekaterina declared Shin as the Messenger of God, and the campaign to subjugate the Demon Beast Territory started immediately. They couldn't establish a concrete policy and were getting anxious. Although it wasn't supported by any sound reasoning, they convinced themselves that if they could achieve greater merits than Shin, they could revoke his title as the Messenger of God.

And Maria... wasn't on their radar.

Due to Pope Ekaterina's shocking declaration at the departure ceremony, I was recognized as the "Messenger of God" by the united nations of the world.

Even if I wanted to complain, there were a lot of people at the departure ceremony, and what would happen if I complained to the Pope in front of them...?

It's possible that it was all calculated, including this aspect, isn't it?

In that situation, no one would complain to me.

Following the book published by Earlshide, it was a declaration of the recognition of the Messenger of God by the Pope of the Church of Creation.

Thanks to that, I don't think I'm considered a threat to the world...

"...The titles I don't know about are increasing..."

"It's not a big deal. Titles are only given to those whose abilities are recognized. I want one too."

Maria casually says she wants a title as well.

"...Well, then, I'll think of one for you."

What's good? A nickname suitable for Maria...

...How about "Seeker of Love"?

"Wha-what? Stop looking at me with such pitiful eyes..."

Maria is also a beautiful girl... She's strong enough to defeat Demon Beasts on her own. But for some reason, she remains in the shadows... doesn't stand out...

I hope a good person comes into Maria's life too.

Oh, how about this?

"'Seeker of Love,' what do you think?"

"Alright, come out, Shin!"

"I'm in the middle of a carriage ride, Maria."

"I don't care! I'm going to give you a smack for saying silly things!"

Hmph, it seems she didn't like it.

Currently, we are attending the departure ceremony and traveling in carriages along with the military of each country we are assigned to. My group with Cecily and Maria is headed to the Darm Kingdom.

The Auges squad is going to Kurt, the Riaju squad to Kanan, and the Discrepancy squad to Swied.

It was great that we all visited different countries during the summer vacation. Everyone used the gates to immediately join the respective military forces.

Now, in the carriage, we're heading towards the border with the Demon Beast Territory and the old imperial border. I can fly, but others can't use levitation magic yet, and even with jet boots, the distance is too great. That's why we are traveling in carriages.

Inside the carriage, Maria's magic power is running wild. She's about to take damage even before we reach the battlefield.

"Th-this is a joke, you know. Maria will find a good person soon."

"The one who has the time? You're pretty high and mighty."

Maria seems fed up. Someone really should appear in front of this girl...

"Report! A large group of monsters has appeared up ahead!"

Not monsters, though!

"Hehe... Can I, um, say something?"

"W-what is it?"

Because it's scary! I involuntarily used polite language!

"Is it okay if I kill those monsters?"

"Huh? But for large ones, the military should handle it..."

"I just want to land one hit..."

Her smile is wicked!

I decided that it's better to let her release some stress with a single strike without arguing.

"Uh, sorry."

"Huh! What is it? Your Holiness!"

I called out to one of the knights of the Darm Kingdom riding alongside our carriage, and they casually addressed me as "Your Holiness."

"Uh... I'd rather you not call me that..."

"Huh?"

"Well, never mind. Can we take care of those monsters as the first move in the battle?"

"You, Your Holiness?"

"It's not me, but I thought it'd be good for everyone to know our capabilities."

"I see! Understood! I'll relay this to the commander!"

With that, the knight rode off.

I wonder if that's a good excuse for Maria to use her magic. In reality, I think it's important for them to know just how strong she is.

After a while, the knight I had spoken to returned.

"Report! We'll allow it only as the first move! Handling the monsters, including the larger ones, is normally our job!"

"Yes, I understand. It's just to showcase our abilities and such."

"Understood! Then, please proceed with the first move!"

They seem very enthusiastic. It must mean they're putting a lot of effort into this operation.

We need to work hard to contribute as well.

"Maria, they've given the green light for the first move."

"Understood."

Eventually, the marching column stopped, and the combined forces of Darm, Els, and Eys formed their battle formation to confront the monsters.

As for Maria, who was entrusted with the first move, she exited the carriage, used her jet boots, and stood on top of the carriage's roof like a guardian deity.

When the horde of monsters came into range, a dense concentration of magic power began to gather around Maria.

She had been practicing magic control for nearly half a year and could now handle a considerable amount of magic power.

And she used the imagery of the magic process that she learned from me.

Maria had chosen wind magic. With her proficiency in controlling vast amounts of magic power, she converted that magic power into wind magic.

Then...

"Take this, you bastards!"

Countless wind blades attacked the horde of monsters.

The wind blades released by Maria trampled over the monsters. As they were sent flying by the wind, they soon turned into a tornado.

The swirling monsters inside the tornado were shredded to pieces by the raging wind blades, one after another.

...She seemed pretty angry. She unleashed a grand spell without any precision whatsoever.

"Maria, you don't have to get that angry..."

"Shishiry, you shouldn't say that to Maria, you know?"

The reason she got mad was all because of me.

We were surprised by Maria's furious display, and I asked, "Maria, were you really that upset?" The combined forces of the mixed army watching around us were left speechless by the power of her magic.

"Al... right, all troops! Most of the monsters are taken care of! We're going to mop up the rest!"

"Ye... yes!"

The commander, who had carelessly forgotten to give orders, raised his voice, and the stunned soldiers headed towards the remaining monsters for the cleanup.

"By the way, choosing wind magic, huh?"

"Fire magic would leave heat behind, water magic would mess up the ground, and explosions and earth magic would change the terrain... I didn't have many options, so wind magic was the best choice."

"You... you remained calm, huh?"

"I mean, I wasn't practicing precise magic, so it felt more relaxed."

Currently, only the first move was entrusted to us, which meant the soldiers would handle the follow-up. In that case, magic that would complicate the terrain couldn't be used. I think wind magic was the best choice.

I thought she was quite angry, but she still had room for that consideration.

"Ah, it looks like we're done."

"Well, yeah, when you finish them all at once..."

A few soldiers returned without killing a single monster. Then, a group of soldiers who had come back from the battle turned to look at Maria still on top of the carriage.

"Valkyrie."

"Huh..."

"Standing resolutely on the battlefield and slaughtering monsters with overwhelming power... She's a true Valkyrie!"

What was that? She was just irritated, stood on the carriage, and released a massive spell to let off steam, you know?

I looked at Maria on top of the roof, and oh, her face had turned bright red.

But, because she was so conspicuous on the roof, she seemed to be frozen without being able to react strangely.

"Maria."

"Wha-wha-what?"

You're so flustered...

"Just raise your hand casually and give a response to the soldiers before coming down."

"R-right!"

Saying that, she raised her hand to respond to the soldiers.

"Uwaahhhhh!!!"

And there was a loud cheer from the soldiers.

Did it become a signal for the end of the battle?

In response to the suddenly raised loud cheer, Maria froze again.

"Maria! It's okay now! Come down!"

"Huh? Uh, okay."

Maria, after descending from the roof, jumped into the carriage as if escaping.

"That was an amazing cheer, Maria."

"I can still hear it, you know? 'Valkyrie.'"

"St-stop it... don't call me that..."

Maria was struggling with the nickname that was given to her.

"Hehe, it's embarrassing when others call you that, right?"

"Shishiry, Shin... I understand how you feel. This is... embarrassing."

"Isn't it? But if Maria is called this, I wonder if the others are going through the same thing?"

"...I feel for them."

Well, for now, they should understand our abilities, so maybe it'll be easier to coordinate with everyone?

The first horde of monsters encountered by this allied army.

It was reported that the number of hordes had increased significantly, perhaps due to the approaching Demon Territory.

Ralph had prepared himself for some casualties, but then an offer came from the Ultimate Magicians: could they release the first move to demonstrate their power?

Ralph felt annoyed inwardly about their forwardness, but upon further thought, he realized that the only ones who didn't know their capabilities were the Dam's side, as he learned in the meeting.

It was an excellent

"No... I'm pretty sure... Ah, it's Maria. Maria von Messina, right?"

"W-what...? You mean to say that someone other than them... released such a powerful magic?"

Shin and Sicily, who are perceived as adversaries by them.

However, it wasn't Shin and Sicily who cast the recent powerful magic.

Ralph believed that they had to achieve even greater feats than Shin and Sicily.

Seeing the power demonstrated by the Ultimate Magicians, who were not Shin and Sicily, only added to Ralph's anxiety.

On a different note, in the Dam Grand Cathedral at that time...

"Ouch... I've got a big bump."

"You've still got it, Master. When Caché bumped her head, I clenched my butt."

"Aaron, you were the one who got hit by Merlin the most... brings back memories."

"Do you have to bring up that stuff, big brother?"

Three people who once traveled together with Merlin and Merida were gathered and reminiscing about the past.

At that time, their fellow travelers have become the heads of state for the three major nations.

While Dizem was already a crown prince at the time, the other two were just a royal retainer and a mere merchant.

Reflecting on it, it's quite moving that they are now meeting as the heads of state of their respective countries.

"By the way, Master, it seems like Shin cares about you a lot."

"Yes, he's like a real grandson to me. And Shin regards Merida as his real grandmother too. Well... she scolds him all the time, though."

"...I see."

"Considering what happened back then, it's probably only natural..."

When Aaron mentioned that, the room fell into silence.

"Oh... I'm sorry... I brought up a difficult topic for Caché..."

"No, it's okay... it's a long time ago. I've come to terms with it."

"I see..."

Despite claiming to have come to terms with it, Ekaterina had a slightly pained expression.

Sensing that, neither Dizem nor Aaron said anything more.

"However... like a real grandson, huh..."

As Ekaterina spoke, she looked out the window.

To Dizem and Aaron, her profile seemed somewhat lonely. ideas
