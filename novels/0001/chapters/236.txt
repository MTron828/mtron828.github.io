 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

While Shin was opening up to Merida and others at his home, a man was visiting a certain house in the Royal Capital of Earlsheid.

When he rang the doorbell, a female voice came from inside.

"Hello. Who is it?"

"Oh, it's Royce."

The visitor to the house was Royce von Claude, the eldest son of the Claude family.

He was Sicily's older brother.

"Royce, what brings you here?"

And the one who came out of the house was Alice.

"Hey, Alice, is your dad at home?"

"Dad went shopping with Mom a little while ago."

"Oh, I see."

"Do you need something from Dad?"

"Yeah, I have some documents that need to be reviewed by the president as soon as possible."

"I see. Dad is off today, but Royce, you're not on a break?"

"Wolfford Trading Company operates year-round. I try to avoid taking breaks at the same time as my boss."

"I see. Well, I think he'll be back soon. Will you wait inside?"

"Is that okay?"

"Of course."

Royce, Sicily's brother, was the Executive Director of Wolfford Trading Company, where Shin served as the president.

Alice's father, Glen Corner, was the CEO.

In other words, they had a boss-subordinate relationship.

Today, Royce was on duty, but urgent documents that required the president's review had come up, so he visited their home.

"Here, have some tea."

"Thank you. Oh, this tea tastes different."

"Right? It's Quanlong tea."

"I see. By the way, weren't the Ultimate Magicians dispatched to a country on the other side of Els?"

"Yes! There's a commotion over there as well!"

As mentioned earlier, Alice had a sense of distrust towards men close to her, just like she told Shin. However, she had no such reservations towards Royce, her father's subordinate and Sicily's brother.

Alice chatted about the commotion in Quanlong, making it amusing without revealing any confidential information. Royce watched her with amusement.

She was not only her boss's daughter but also a friend of her younger sister.
