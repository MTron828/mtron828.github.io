The first day of the research conference has ended, so everyone is heading back to their respective homes. Some are walking, some are taking a shared carriage ride, and some are returning to the dormitories provided by the academy since the royal capital is vast and not directly accessible from home.

There are no dormitory residents among the classmates of the S class, so everyone leaves the academy together.

"Hey, Mark, can I come to your house now?"
"Huh? My place?"
"Yeah. I want to confirm what can be done and what can't with the new weapons you mentioned earlier."
"Oh, sure. Should we go now?"
"Yeah, how about you, Sicily, Maria, is it okay if we stop by Mark's house?"
"That's fine."
"I'm okay with it. I also want to see Mark's shop."
"Can I come too?"

Surprisingly, Tony expressed his desire to go with them.

"You're still interested in the Bean Workshop?"
"Yeah, even though I don't swing a sword anymore, I still get excited when I see one."
"You didn't want to become a knight?"
"I didn't like the Knight Training Officer Academy, not knights or swordsmen, specifically."

"So... it's the male-to-female ratio..."
"That place is hell for me."

Since entering the academy, Tony often hangs out with girls, so the lack of girls seems to be bothering him. He mentioned today as being unusual because he didn't walk home with any girls, so the Bean Workshop must be quite appealing.

"In that case, I'll go too."
"Your Highness!"
"Shin is also one of my guards, and there's no danger in this. Besides, my father often visits Shin's house."
"Your Majesty..."

Og continued to follow them, saying something that sounded like a setup.

"We've got quite a few people now."
"It's fine. It's fun to stroll around the city together like this."
"Yes, it is enjoyable."

Mark, Olivia, me, Sicily, Maria, Tony, Og, Thor, and Julius, a total of nine people, head to Mark's house.

As we walk, the men and women, as well as Og's group, naturally separate. The women are walking and chatting happily.

"So, Waldford, what kind of sword are you thinking of?"
"Yeah, well, a thin blade is the basic requirement, but it's also fragile. I want to be able to replace it quickly, but having too many means spending a lot of money..."

"Let's hurry to the workshop! I have so many ideas I want to try out, and I can't stop thinking about it!"
"Yeah, that sounds like a plan."
"Hey, Shin, while you guys are at the workshop, can we stay at Olivia's place?"
"I'd like to talk more with Olivia."
"Ugh... please go easy on me..."

It seems that Sicily and Maria bombarded Olivia with various questions, as she looked exhausted.

"Sure, it's fine. I thought it might be boring at the workshop anyway."

The men and Og head to the workshop, while the women head to Olivia's shop. They hurry to their respective destinations. Along the way, they pass by a large building.

"What's this building here?"
"Oh, this is the guard station. The building over there is the training ground, and the guard station is further inside."

"I see, I didn't know that..."

BOOM!

The wall of the training ground explodes.

"Ahhhh!"

The sound makes the women scream.

"What's going on?"
"Your Highness!"

The two guards step forward to shield Og.

"What's happening? Was there an accident in the training ground?"
"No, there should be a magic barrier in place on the training ground's walls, just like at the academy's practice grounds..."

"Someone must have cast a powerful spell to break through it..."

This doesn't look good. As they discuss, a massive surge of magic emerges from the training ground.

"This is bad! Everyone, get away from this building!"

As they try to move everyone away, the wall behind them explodes.

"What the... What's happening?"

I had set up a magic barrier since I sensed something dangerous inside. I shouted involuntarily, but there was no damage.

They wonder what's going on when they peer inside the broken wall and see a person surrounded by knights, soldiers, mages, and members of the guard.

"Whoa! What's all the commotion?"

It's quite an intimidating atmosphere, especially given the excessive force surrounding the single person. With the enormous magic surge and the situation, they wonder who that person is, and when they get a good look...

"An eyepatch over both eyes..."

That person has the same characteristic that Og had mentioned about a shady teacher from the intermediate academy.

"Og, is that...?"
"Yeah, there's no doubt. It's Oliver Strom, the suspicious teacher from the intermediate academy we talked about."

"Oh? Well, well, if it isn't Prince Augustus and Shin Wolford."

He knows who I am? My name aside, my face shouldn't be known to anyone beyond the local residents. Besides, isn't he supposed to be blind?

"Please run away, Prince Augustus! He's the true culprit of the Demonkin incident!"

The true culprit of the Demonkin incident? Does that mean...

"Are you the one who controlled Kurt?"
"That's right. He danced to my tune quite amusingly."

Disgusting.

"Why, aren't you going to forgive me too?"
"No, I can't forgive you. Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused everyone?"

As I say this, I enhance my magic.

"I'm done with my experiments here, so I'd like to take my leave."
"If I leave you unattended, you'll likely cause more trouble. Stay put!"

With that, I draw my Vibration Sword and release a fiery arrow.

"Oh, this is bad."

He says this and erects a magic barrier.

BOOM!

The fiery arrow strikes the magic barrier and explodes. However, it seems the barrier held up.

"This is dangerous... If the barrier were a bit weaker, it would have gone through."

Saying this, he looks in my direction.

"What...?"

You can't expect me to stay in the same place forever!

Anticipating that my magic would be blocked by the sheer magnitude of his magic, I had moved behind Strom after releasing the spell.

I swing my Vibration Sword sideways.

"Ugh!"

Strom, whether he sensed the magic or had a hunch, instinctively moves out of the way, avoiding the path of the Vibration Sword's strike.

"That was close. Is that sword some kind of magical tool?"
"Well, who knows?"

Without answering Strom's question, I charge towards him.

"It seems you are indeed dangerous."

Saying that, he releases magic without incantation. I dodge the magic with a sideways jump. Explosions are happening behind me, but I don't pay them any mind. I swing the Vibration Sword again.

"Whoa! This sword is quite troublesome."

This time, Strom jumps back to evade the Vibration Sword.

"You're a magician, right? Physical attacks are harder to defend against than magic, aren't they?"

Saying this, he stamps his foot on the ground, and stone spears shoot out from the earth, aiming for Strom.

"Whoa, this is incredible!"

While saying this, he leaps into the sky.

"You're defenseless up there!"

I release a wide flame magic spell towards Strom, who is still airborne. He can't avoid this even if he tries to contort his body.

"Ah!"

As expected, Strom is taken by surprise. He hastily deploys a magic barrier, but it activates too slowly. I'm sure some damage got through.

I anticipated that the flames would envelop Strom and then descend, but that didn't happen.

"Floating in mid-air, that's cheating."

Strom is floating in mid-air. Levitation magic? You're not supposed to be able to use that. But Strom is actually floating in mid-air. This is unbelievable.

"Phew, I panicked for a moment. My robe got singed."

"No physical damage, then?"

"Well, a bit of damage was done, of course. You are indeed the grandson of a hero, capable of vanquishing demons."

"I wouldn't be so sure... Oof!"

Learning from my past mistakes, I activate the jet boots I had prepared and leap towards Strom.

"What!?!"

"Take this!"

I swing the Vibration Sword again. This time, the blade grazes Strom's face. Damn, just a graze!

"Ugh!"

Strom dramatically flinches, as if he thought he couldn't be hurt.

"Take this, too!"

In this opening, I create a barrage of wind blades.

Countless wind blades assail Strom, cutting wounds into his body one after another and leaving marks on his robe and eyepatch.

"Don't get too... cocky!"

"Ugh!"

Suddenly, he releases his magic power, causing me, who was in mid-air, to lose balance due to the pressure. I quickly activate the jet boots to regain my composure and land.

Strom, still floating in the air, maintains his magic release and gazes in my direction.

The eyepatch must have been damaged by the Vibration Sword strike and the wind blades. The damaged eyepatch is torn apart and falls from his face. His eye beneath it is unscathed. There, I see...

"Red... eyes?"

He stares at me with wide, red eyes. The released magic is eerie, clearly exhibiting the characteristics of a demon.

"You did it, Wolfort-kun. I wanted to leave without revealing my true identity, but..."

"Are you kidding...? A demon who has retained full control of its faculties?"

Everyone around us is also in shock. It's understandable, as demons are not known to possess reason. That's the common knowledge. Nevertheless, in the past, this demon caused unimaginable havoc. So, what happens when it retains its faculties?

"Retaining my faculties doesn't mean I'm going to rampage recklessly."

"Hehe, I'd be swiftly vanquished if all I did was use my powers recklessly, right? I'm not foolish enough to do that. However, once they figure out I'm a demon, they'll come after me for extermination. So I wanted to keep my true identity hidden."

"So, you won't harm humans?"

"Hahaha, ahahahaha!"

Strom starts laughing loudly in response to my question.

"What are you expecting? You! Humans are utterly insignificant!"

"What did you say...?!"

"Since taking on this form, humans have become utterly insignificant to me! Whether I use them, deceive them, or kill them, I don't care anymore!"

He's gone mad. This guy is truly a demon. A true enemy of humanity. This won't do. I have to take him down right here!

"Roar!"

I let out a battle cry and lunge at him.

"Is it that again?"

Strom tries to counter with magic, but I activate my jet boots, come to a sudden stop, and then leap backward to put distance between us.

"What...?"

Strom, who feels like he's been tricked, gives me a bewildered look, but my magic is already complete.

"Eat this!"

"What is this!?"

From high above, I focus sunlight, concentrating it into a beam, and shoot it down at Strom. As he was about to cast a spell at me, Strom is directly struck by the light from above.

"Gwaaah!"

Strom screams as he takes the full brunt of the magic. Did it work this time?

Then, a charred and blistered Strom emerges.

"You... You've gone quite far..."

"Tch! Is that still not enough?"

"No, no... It worked, you know? Once I've achieved my goal, I'll want to kill you next!"

Saying that, he releases an explosion magic around himself. Strom's body is hidden within the flames, and for a moment, everyone loses sight of him.

"Well, then, Wolfort-kun, Mr. Orto, and everyone else. I'm truly taking my leave now."

Strom's voice can be heard from above. When I look up, there is a guy hovering in the air while repairing his body.

"You! Come down!"

An older knight shouts, but Strom pays him no mind.

"Are there fools here who actually want me to surrender? Well then, everyone, until we meet again."

Saying that, Strom ascends even higher.

"Dammit!"

I activate my jet boots and jump into the air, but I'm too late. Strom has already increased his speed and left the area.

Descending to the ground using my jet boots while adjusting my descent from above, I land.

"Damn it! He got away!"

"Everyone, immediately pursue him! Also, deploy security personnel throughout the capital! The guard, the military, work together and be on high alert! However, don't act alone under any circumstances! Don't forget that the opponent is a demon!"

"Yes, sir!"

The older knight gives instructions to the knights around him. After giving the instructions, he comes over to me, kneeling. Huh? Why?

"It's been a while, Your Highness August."

"Nice to see you again, August."

Before I knew it, Aug had come to my side. And before I realized it, the others were there too. In fact...

"Did he not escape again?"

"Shin, are you injured?"

"I'm fine, don't worry."

While Sicily continues to pat my body, I turn my gaze toward Aug.

"Well... I recognized him as someone I knew, but I never thought he would be a demon. When I found out he was a demon... surprise overtook any thoughts of escape."

"But it's still dangerous. Why were you in a place like this in the first place?"

"What? I was just taking a walk in the city with my friends after returning from the academy."

"Please consider your position."

"Julius, Thor, and Shin are here. It's fine, right?"

"In that respect..."

"Don't be so stern, Dominic. Your Highness is right. He has two guards with him. Did you see them? The two from earlier. They repelled the demon."

The older knight, who has relaxed his posture, says to the knight.

"Well, more like we allowed the demon to escape..."
