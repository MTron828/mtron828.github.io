In the quiet living room where three babies had fallen asleep, we finally took a breath.

Normally, Silver is still a restless child since he's not even three years old, but he's quietly eating snacks just like the adults, perhaps due to his sense of responsibility as an older brother.

Sisily spoke to Irene, who was affectionately stroking Silver's head.

"By the way, Mother, how is Alice doing?"

Alice's engagement to Lois, Sisily and Alice's brother, was announced just before Charle was born. As a result, Alice, who would become a viscountess in the future, started going to Irene on holidays to learn aristocratic manners.

In response to Sisily's question, Irene stopped stroking Silver's head and smiled.

"All Alice needs to learn is table manners and how to behave. She's naturally well-behaved and not ill-mannered, so there's no problem. In fact, there's too little to teach, and it lacks excitement."

"But I read in a book that nobles should also be careful about their conversations to avoid giving others a chance to criticize them. Aren't you going to teach her that?"

When I asked this, Irene and Cecil momentarily looked puzzled, then burst into laughter.

"I can't imagine anyone being so audacious as to try to criticize Alice, who is an Ultimate Magician."

Is that so?

We understand that we have greater power than other magicians.

However, that power is purely martial and violent, not political.

Using violence to suppress opinions might create unnecessary conflict...

Perhaps this thought was evident on my face, as Irene smiled knowingly at me.

"I understand your concerns, Shin-kun. But for now, there's no need to worry."

"Why? Why not?"

"Your track record speaks for itself."

"Track record?"

"Yes. You can easily subdue the fear-inducing demons that terrorized the citizens of Aarsheid. You've proven that. There's no one in this country who would dare to oppose you."

That makes sense.

And then, the moment Alice closed the gate...

"Ha! I'm exhausted!" Alice exclaimed with a mysterious shout as she plopped down on the sofa.

"Ah, thank you, Marika-san," she added.

Marika handed her a cold drink as she lounged on the sofa in a disheveled manner.

Alice started drinking the beverage without a trace of elegance.

"Phew! I've come back to life."

Sipping the last of her drink, Alice placed the empty glass on the table.

"You seem quite tired," Ellie remarked with a chuckle as she observed Alice's demeanor.

"Just had a dance lesson until just now. Dancing is so tough because I've never done it before," Alice explained.

"Well, shall I teach you?" Ellie offered.

"Ugh, no, please don't. I came here for a break; why make me tired on purpose?" Alice protested.

Hearing Alice's words, Ellie and Sisily couldn't help but laugh.

"Well, I suppose it's quite challenging to learn at this stage," Ellie remarked.

"Yes, we've been taking lessons since we were children, so I can imagine that learning as an adult would be tough," Sisily added.

Listening to Ellie and Sisily's words, Alice leaned back against the sofa's backrest and pouted.

"Ugh. Manners at the table are tricky, and I have to work on my speech. It's such a hassle."

Alice's attitude seemed a bit annoyed as she spoke.

Although Alice found it bothersome, these were essential things for a noblewoman.

If she were to neglect them, it might jeopardize her marriage to Lois.

Thinking of this, Sisily tried to comfort her.

"Table manners and speech are necessary to avoid being looked down upon by everyone, my lady."

"That's right. Just as Lady Claude says, you may be respected, including by nobles in this country, but it's easy for that respect to turn into contempt if people think you lack refinement."

"Huh? Is that so?"

Surprised by Sisily's words, Alice's posture changed from slouched to leaning forward.

"Yes. Even a hero, if seen as coarse and uncultured, would be looked down upon by the people. It's easy for them to think of that person as a barbarian, even if they don't show open defiance."

"Oh? Really?"

"..."

"And you will likely hear something like this: 'Lady Alice of the Viscount Claude family used her power to threaten Lord Lois and secure her position as a lady.' "

"What!?"

In response to Ellie's words, Alice stood up in anger.

Ellie quietly observed Alice's reaction.

"You will hear it. Right now, everyone's eyes on you are filled with envy, with a hint of jealousy. In such an atmosphere, a commoner turned noble lady with that kind of attitude... it won't take long."

"..."

Ellie's tone was not mocking; she spoke with a serious expression.

Hearing this, Alice sat back down on the sofa in silence.

"So, don't be bothered by it and do your best. Your actions will directly affect Lord Lois's reputation."

"...You're right. I can't stand it if Lois is ridiculed, so I'll do my best."

"You have Sisily and me by your side. If you have any worries, feel free to consult us."

"Yeah. Thanks, Ellie."

With those words, Alice's expression changed from her previous annoyance to a determined one.

"Ah, by the way, should I change the way I talk here?"

"Is there any need to change it here? Isn't it tough if you can't switch between public and private manners?"

"I see. I'll just be myself here then."

"That's the way."

Saying this, Ellie elegantly took a sip of tea.

I couldn't help but watch Ellie, surprised by her words and actions. She noticed my gaze and shot me an annoyed look.

"...Are you thinking something impolite again?"

"Why do you know?"

"I can tell!"

Come to think of it, we had a similar exchange when Ellie was pregnant.

Ellie is the Crown Princess, the second most noble woman in this country after Queen Julia.

However, I've only ever seen Ellie's private side. When it comes to her public persona, I can't help but feel uncomfortable.

"Honestly, Oug, please say something."

Ellie probably tried to scold me through Oug, but Oug himself had been covering his face and clutching his stomach since a while ago.

He must be desperately holding back his laughter.

"Oug!"

"Yeah, sorry about that. But, Ellie, isn't it nice that we can have such relaxed exchanges here? It would be a shame to change it."

"That's true, but..."

Oug and Ellie often visit our house.

Ellie, in particular, visits frequently, sometimes even asking Sisily to pick her up if Oug isn't available. She must feel quite comfortable here.

"But anyway, soon it'll be Lady Claude's turn. There are various things to consider."

"What do you mean?"

When Oug mentioned that he had something to think about concerning himself, Alice also became curious.

"When Lady Claude becomes the host, it will be difficult for the Ultimate Magicians to be stationed here regularly."

"Oh, I see."

Alice is going to marry Lois, the next Lord of the Claude Viscount family. That means she will have to make appearances as the future lady of the viscount's estate. It won't be suitable for her to continue the activities of the Ultimate Magicians.

"Lady Walford and Lady Bean are currently on maternity leave. They are likely to take maternity leave frequently in the future."

Does that mean they're having a second or third child? Well, I won't deny that possibility.

"Also, we don't know what will happen with Carlton and Messina in the future. In that case, the Ultimate Magicians will face a shortage of talent."

"That's true..."

"Furthermore, I will eventually succeed to the throne, and Thor and Julius will be the next lords. You, too, will grow older over time. It's such a shame to let this globally renowned organization that we created end with our generation."

"...I see. So, you want us to have successors, right?"

That's right.

Certainly, this organization, the Ultimate Magicians, relies on us. Without us, the organization can't continue.

However, after a year of operation, we've received excellent reviews from various countries. It would be a shame to let this organization disappear like this.

"So, does that mean we need to recruit new members?"

"That's true, but... this is also a troublesome matter."

"What do you mean?"

"We acquired unique abilities based on your past life's knowledge."

"Oh."

"However, if we misuse this power, it could become a new source of trouble. We can't just go around teaching it to anyone."

"Well, that makes sense."

I taught magic based on my past life's knowledge to Oug and the others because I was unaware of the magical abilities in this world.

As a result, they all became exceptionally skilled magic users in this world.

We were close friends who were always together in the same class, so I believe they won't misuse their powers. However, we can't be sure about new members. Some may approach with hidden ambitions. If we were to teach them magic based on my past life's knowledge, the peace we obtained after defeating the demons could be disrupted by human hands.

Oug has been telling us this repeatedly, so even our direct disciple Mei-chan hasn't been taught these magics.

"If I don't teach my knowledge, it might mean we lack the necessary power."

That's right. The Ultimate Magicians must be the world's top magicians. It's not just my decision; it's the will of the people.

So, everyone wants us to be like that?

That's right. That's why we can say that they have full confidence in us. If people with insufficient abilities enter, fail to complete missions, and lose trust, it would be a problem.

I see.

It's certainly a difficult situation. We want to secure talent, but we have to make the entry requirements for the Ultimate Magicians strict. However, this might result in a lack of suitable candidates.

"Ugh, in that case, should we create some kind of sub-organization for the Ultimate Magicians?"

I thought of this because of my past experience with professional sports organizations. They often have a minor league or a lower-tier organization where new players join and develop their skills before eventually moving up to the main team.

"A sub-organization..."

As I mentioned this idea, it surprisingly piqued Oug's interest, and he started pondering with his arms crossed.

"For now, we can recruit promising individuals and nurture them in the sub-organization... This might be a good idea."

"Is that so? Then we'll need to establish entry criteria."

It seems that we are likely to create a sub-organization, so I asked a question that had been bothering me.

"By the way, I haven't had the chance to see Mei-chan's progress in magic practice lately. How skilled has she become?"

Mei-chan is now a third-year student at the secondary school, having started this spring. There are practical magic classes in the secondary school, and I haven't been able to observe her practice since she joined.

I wondered how far her abilities had developed without my past life knowledge. Oug's expression became quite serious when he heard my question.

"...She's almost at a level where she could single-handedly defeat disaster-level magical creatures..."

"Huh!?"

The first to react to Oug's words was Granny.

"Wait! Is that true, Your Highness? Even Merlin, back when he was a first-year student at the High School, struggled to defeat a large magical creature. And Mei-chan has just become a third-year student, but she's already disaster-level!?"

"Well, indeed... that's quite impressive."

Not only Granny but also Grandpa were surprised. It's understandable; it's as if she's saying she's stronger than I was in my youth.

Oug's statement surprised Shishiri and Ellie too, but Alice was the only one who wasn't fazed.

"Did Alice know about this?"

"Well, yeah, we were the ones who took Princess Mei on monster-slaying missions."

When Alice said that, Oug shot her a sharp look.

Being glared at by Oug, Alice just turned her head and nonchalantly whistled.

"Sigh... ordinarily, it's abnormal for someone who hasn't even reached adulthood to go on monster-slaying missions. As you can see, Corna and Hughes often accompanied her on those missions, so there was no hesitation about going on monster-slaying missions."

So, Oug didn't know about this...

"And Mei's classmates joined her, it seems. They treated it like a regular outing. The Hunter Association also didn't raise any concerns, especially since Corna and Hughes were always there."

I see, perhaps she became too famous and gained odd trust from people.

Certainly, if Alice and Lin, who can easily defeat even demons, are with her, the association probably doesn't have much to say.

"Wait a minute, are Mei-chan's friends the same two from back then? Agnes-san and Colin, right?"

"That's right."

Agnes-san, like Thor and Julius, has been a companion of Mei-chan since childhood. She was chosen due to her noble family background and her character, but they are truly close friends.

Colin, on the other hand, is actually Tom's (who took care of me when I was a child) son. He's a commoner, but due to certain circumstances, he became Mei-chan's companion, which is quite unusual for a boy. His father, Tom, who is the head of the prestigious Harg Company, has Granny's complete trust, and Colin has been with us since elementary school.

Interestingly, these two, in fact, received direct magical instruction from us during their elementary school years. This was the result of Mei-chan's suggestion, which Alice and Lin eagerly followed. Starting magic practice earlier than others their age seems to have given them superior magical abilities.

"All three of them can defeat large magical creatures on their own, but for disaster-level creatures, they still need to cooperate as a trio."

"Even so, it's extraordinary."

To think that Grandpa, who was considered the best in the world, barely managed to defeat a large magical creature as a first-year student at the Advanced Magic Academy. It's clear that the current abilities of Mei-chan and her friends surpass those of Grandpa during his youth.

"Really... these kids have come so far..."

Oh, Grandpa seems slightly disheartened.

"In your case, didn't you learn on your own? Those kids have Shin as their teacher; it's not the same circumstances."

Oh? Granny defended Grandpa!?

I'm amazed by this sight I've never seen before, and Grandpa regains his composure.

"Well, you have a point."

Grandpa seems neither amazed nor impressed. I suppose this is the typical dynamic of a former couple. I mean, it's been years since they started living together again; maybe they should just restore their marriage certificate.

As I'm pondering such irrelevant matters, Granny turns towards Oug.

"So, do the other kids have abilities on the same level as Mei-chan and her friends?"

"No, it seems like the three of them stand out due to Shin's direct guidance."

"Does that mean the overall level hasn't changed much?"

"Not quite. The information Shin provided to us and the Magic Guild has already spread. Magic's foundation is not in incantations but in mana control. Students' levels are improving every year."

Is that so? That's the first time I've heard of it.

It turns out my world, the one I know, is surprisingly narrow. In the end, I only had interactions with S-class individuals from the Advanced Magic Academy. In other places, my interactions were limited to people like Dis-san and Mei-chan, who are members of the royal family, or Silvie's family. Thinking about it, it's a quite peculiar network of relationships.

Despite my commoner status, I've had limited interactions. Lately, I have some interaction with the parents of the kids through Silvie, but none of them work in magic-related fields. So, to be honest, I don't have much knowledge of the current magical world. There's no interaction with the Magic Guild either.

However, if the children's levels are improving each year, maybe Oug's concerns can be alleviated?

"In that case, how about we start by having Mei-chan and her friends join the Ultimate Magicians?"

When I said that, Oug had a stern expression.

"Certainly, among the current children, Mei and her friends' abilities are outstanding. However, the world at large is unaware of this. If we were to include Mei in the Ultimate Magicians now, people might assume that the Ultimate Magicians recruit based on connections."

Ah, I see.

We interact with them casually, but Mei-chan is a royal princess. The general public can't access that kind of personal information. If we make Mei-chan the first addition to the Ultimate Magicians, it might be seen as a result of connections. It's a difficult situation.

"And besides, Mei is a princess. She's already in a precarious situation; it's hard to even express it with the term 'tomboy.' If this continues, she might end up without any suitors."

I see. Now that you mention it, I feel like Dis-san told me the same thing a long time ago. But Mei-chan is already fourteen, soon to be fifteen. At that age, she might have one or two people she likes.

"Have you discussed such matters with Mei-chan?"

"I wonder? I don't know everything about Mei, especially her experiences at the secondary academy."

"Aren't you a bit disinterested in Mei-chan?"

She's a princess, after all. If she's dating someone, as royalty, you should at least know about it.

I don't know about that. If Mei starts dating someone, we might conduct an investigation, but it would mainly be about the background of the person. Whether they have any harmful intentions toward Mei or any connections to the underworld.

Is that acceptable?

I don't mind. Arlsheid is a country that supports free love. As long as she isn't getting involved with shady people, even a member of the royal family can date whomever they want.

I see.

That's why I'm concerned about her causing any more trouble. If she keeps this up, she might eventually be called a "wayward princess."

After saying that, Oug sighed as if he were truly exhausted.

He may always act brusque, but in moments like these, he's a caring older brother.

So, what should we do?

For now... regarding Mei, we should respect her wishes, but it's best not to make her the first member. Before that, we should conduct entrance exams and establish some achievements.

I see. In that case, let's create a subsidiary organization and conduct entrance exams.

Right, then about the exam content...

Hold on, both of you!

When Oug and I were about to discuss the exam content, Ellie's voice interrupted us.

We came here on our day off, yet all you're talking about is work. Please, cherish some family time!

That's right. It's wonderful to be dedicated to your work, but today is meant for the family to spend time together. Please forget about work for now.

If both Ellie and Silvie said that, there was no way to proceed. With that said, we looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders.

Right, it's a holiday today, so let's put aside work talk.

Yeah, sorry about that, Ellie.

As they suggested, we decided to stop this conversation for now and focus on spending time with our family.

Huh? I'm starting to feel like I'm the odd one out here.

Alice said that, so I exchanged glances with Silvie and then addressed Alice.

What are you talking about, Sister-in-Law?

That's right, Sister-in-Law. You're part of the family too.

...Sister-in-Law just sounds off-putting. I feel like there's an insurmountable barrier.

With teary eyes, Alice said that, and we couldn't help but burst into laughter.

In this way, our holiday passed in a warm and jovial atmosphere.

However, the matter of new recruits for the Ultimate Magicians needs to be resolved soon.

Once the holiday is over, we should promptly gather everyone's opinions and work on the details of the plan. a code snippet
