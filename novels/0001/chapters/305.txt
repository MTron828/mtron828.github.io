Charlotte entered elementary school, and some time passed since Sylvester also started learning magic.

The Wolford family had once again become a nursery today.

"Sean, Nova, Skoll, Mina, Annette, Anna, it's snack time."

"Yes!"

In response to Cecily's call, the children gathered at the Wolford family's house all replied enthusiastically and rushed over.

"Mom! What's today's snack?"

"Hehe, today's snack is pudding."

"Wow!"

"Yay!"

"I love pudding!"

When Cecily announced today's snack, the children all cheered in unison.

Cecily gazed at the children with a smile on her face.

Cecily, originally known as the Holy Maiden, had such a loving smile that the followers of the Creator's Faith believed she might be called the Holy Mother if they saw her like this while being a mother.

"Now, let's go wash your hands."

"Yes!"

Saying that, she led the children to the washroom.

By the way, Sean is Sylvester and Cecily's second son.

Nova, whose full name is Novak, is the eldest son of August and Ellie.

Skoll is the eldest son of Alice and Royce.

Mina is the eldest daughter of Mark and Olivia.

Annette is the eldest daughter of Yuri and Morgan.

Anna is the eldest daughter of Tony and Lilia.

They are all the same age, three years old.

There are other children the same age as them in Thor and Julius's households, but they are not here as they are being raised in their respective territories.

The Wolford family serves as a sanctuary for mothers raising their children in the capital city to take a break.

"Ah, I always feel at ease when I come here."

Alice, Skoll's mother and the Viscountess of the Claude family, sat on the sofa, completely relaxed, with her legs stretched out.

Her demeanor was quite improper, and it was hard to believe that she was a noblewoman with children.

"Come on, Alice, that's quite improper."

"It's fine, Ellie. I can't be this lazy unless I come here. The Wolford family is my sanctuary."

"It feels like we've come quite a long way..."

"This place is only about a fifteen-minute walk from Lilia's house, you know?"

"It's a matter of perspective."

Alice pouted her lips at Lilia, who didn't seem to understand.

As they were engaged in this conversation, the children returned from the washroom to the living room.

"Mama!"

Sköll exclaimed as he hugged Alice.

"Oh, you're so full of energy. Did you wash your hands properly?"

"Yes!"

"Hehe, good."

Alice said this while smiling and patting Sköll's head.

...All the other mothers, except Alice, were left speechless. Wait, isn't this a completely different person? The transformation was so drastic that they couldn't believe it. The four of them, who witnessed this change, shivered and trembled, looking down.

"What's wrong, everyone? Now, the children are eagerly waiting, so shall we begin?"

Responding warmly to the four women, who were clearly struggling but trying to maintain their noblewoman façade, Alice did not let her guard down. She couldn't afford to disappoint Sköll.

Upon hearing Alice's words, the children cheered, "Yay!" and swarmed around the pudding.

Confirming this, Alice muttered quietly, "Remember this for later."

Hearing this, the four women couldn't help but burst into laughter, perplexing the children who looked at them strangely.

It goes without saying that the number of veins on Alice's forehead increased.

"Oh my, hehe, my dear sister-in-law."

"Well, Cecily, what's gotten into you?"

Even Cecily joined in on the teasing.

Alice couldn't help but think to herself, "She's not my sister-in-law! Everyone's making fun of me!" However, despite her inexplicable feelings of humiliation, she continued to be a loving mother in front of her beloved son, Sköll.

"Let's dig in!"

"Yes, please enjoy."

The children paid no attention to the exchanges between the mothers and eagerly started eating their pudding.

"It's so delicious!"

"Yeah!"

As they savored the sweet, creamy pudding, the children's faces melted, and the mothers realized their own faces were softening in response.

"Hehe, they're so cute."

"That's true. Children of this age are the most adorable. Lately, Viara has become quite adept at being well-behaved, so she rarely shows this kind of expression."

"Well, Viara is a princess, so there's no helping it, right?"

In response to Elizabeth's complaint about Octavia, Cecily couldn't help but smile.

Octavia, as a princess, had already started studying royal etiquette. As a result, she was losing some of her childlike qualities compared to other children her age. While she understood the expectations for her as a royal and a former duke's daughter, she couldn't help but wish Octavia could remain a bit more like a child, especially when she saw her best friend Charlotte's carefree behavior.

The Crown Princess Consort's feelings were complex.

Currently, all the children here are three years old. Even Novak, the prince, had not yet started his etiquette lessons. Elizabeth, as a mother, was determined not to miss the brief time during which royal children could be childlike.

While monitoring the children's snack time during this conversation, Sean spoke to Cecily.

"Mom, when will big brother and big sister come back?"

Sean, who was cherished by his older siblings Sylvester and Charlotte, loved them dearly. That's why he didn't like this time when the two of them were at school and he wanted them to come back right away.

However, it was already a little past lunchtime.

"Well, Sean, if you take a good nap, they'll be back soon."

Cecily stroked Sean's head and encouraged him to take a nap.

Sean and the others, upon hearing this, promptly started preparing for their nap.

"Mom..."

"Yes?"

"I want to go to school too..."

They spread out mats on the living room carpet, lay down together, and covered themselves with small blankets.

In this position, as their mothers gently stroked their heads, their eyelids grew heavy, and their words became even more unclear.

In this state, when Sean, too, expressed the desire to go to school, Cecily smiled gently.

"That's right. Sean, you'll be going to school soon too. To do that, you need to take a good nap and grow a little bigger."

"Yeah... I want to... be big..."

With those words, Sean fell asleep.

Looking around, all the other children were also sound asleep.

Seeing the children asleep, the mothers finally caught their breath.

"Ah, we can finally relax."

Alice exhaled and all of them burst into laughter.

"What's so funny?"

Given the recent events, Alice, with veins bulging on her forehead, approached the others.

However, the more she did, the more the contrast between her current self and her previous one became evident, making it even funnier.

"Hey, Alice, spare us!"

"Hehe, ahaha! Alice, when did you develop a split personality?"

"What you did earlier was incredible!"

"Sp-split..."

"Hehehe."

"You guys..."

Just as Alice was about to complain to Elizabeth and the others, they beat her to it.

"Oh, Alice, if we make too much noise, the children will wake up."

"Ugh!"

Dealing with energetic three-year-olds, as cute as they were, was challenging. Although they had been peacefully napping, it wasn't a good idea to wake them up.

Reluctantly, Alice redirected her frustration.

"Geez, you're all so heartless. I'm just desperately trying not to disappoint Sköll."

"That's why, if you acted like you did earlier, there wouldn't be a problem."

"Even so..."

Alice said that and closed her eyes, taking a deep breath.

"Besides, if I suddenly act this way in front of everyone, won't you all have a good laugh?"

Laughter

"See!"

For someone who always insisted on proper behavior, it seemed that she couldn't escape laughter when she deviated from it.

"What should I do?" Alice pondered while holding her head.

As the mothers continued their conversation, Cecily suddenly remembered Sean's words from earlier.

"Speaking of which, Sean mentioned earlier that he wants to go to the academy too."

"The academy?"

"Yes. He finds it boring with Silver and Charlotte going to the academy. Also, since the two of them seem to be having fun at the academy, Sean wants to join them."

"Oh, I see. By the way, what are Silver and Charlotte like at the academy?"

At Alice's question, Cecily touched her face and tilted her head.

"Well, you know... I've only heard about it from those kids, so they seem to have fun every day, but when you ask me what exactly it's like, I don't know."

"Is that so?"

"Silver has had a few meetings with the teachers and parents, so I have a general idea, but we haven't had a parent-teacher meeting for Charlotte yet."

"Hmm. I wonder how it is."

"Yeah, she's such a tomboy..."

As Cecily spoke, she looked a bit anxious.

"...I'm getting a little worried."

Cecily was gripped by a different kind of anxiety than she had felt with Silver.a database schema
