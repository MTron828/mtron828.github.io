It was decided that Grandpa and Grandma would participate in the final battle against the magical creatures led by Strom.

When this news was conveyed to the soldiers, their enthusiasm was said to be quite overwhelming. Furthermore, when they heard that Grandpa and Grandma wouldn't be on the front lines but would join the soldiers in subduing magical creatures, the excitement escalated even further, as they'd get to fight alongside heroes they had only seen in books or on stage.

The news of this spread worldwide in an instant via communication devices.

But still...

"Is it really that exciting?"

"It would be, right? It's Sir Merlin and Lady Merida, after all?"

"After all, that's about their past glory, isn't it? They're both quite old now. To have such high expectations for elderly people like them..."

I've heard that Uncle Dis, Pope Ekaterina, and President Aaron accompanied them when they were younger. That was over 15 years ago, back when I was about one year old. They defeated magical creatures even before that. Both of them, to put it bluntly, are already elderly.

Yet, just the fact that they're participating in the battle has led to worldwide excitement. I don't get it.

"Past glory... Are you seriously saying that, Shin?"

"Your Highness, Shin-sama has never seen books or stage performances involving the two of them..."

"Oh, right, that's true."

"What's wrong with you two? Why are you both so understanding?"

Og and Thor seemed to accept it because I hadn't seen books or stage performances featuring Grandpa and Grandma, but what's there to understand about that?

"Indeed, Sir Merlin and Lady Merida might be approaching old age, but they are still wizards. Age doesn't matter."

"Well, I understand that, but..."

I understand that age and gender don't matter when it comes to a wizard's strength. But when it comes to the battlefield, physical stamina is probably necessary.

"True, their magical abilities have improved, but the battlefield this time is quite extensive, isn't it? I covered a significant area with walls, you know?"

"Considering what I've seen of them, I'd say such concerns are unnecessary..."

Well, watching them playfully interact with each other, they seem fine...

"Despite all that, they're family, right, Shin? Even if they seem fine, you're still worried about your grandparents going to the battlefield?"

"Of course!"

Yeah, that's right.

They may say it's about past glory or old age, but the truth is, they're worried.

Looking at me like that, Og spoke to me not to tease but to explain.

"Sure, for Shin, Sir Merlin and Lady Merida are just grandparents. But for others, it's different."

"...Heroes..."

"That's right. There are countless books and plays inspired by the two of them. How do you think someone who grew up with those stories would feel when they get to fight alongside those heroes in reality?"

"It's... probably a happy feeling?"

"They are legendary heroes in stories. Nowadays, there are fewer who have actually seen their battles firsthand. Can you imagine the enthusiasm of the soldiers when they heard they might see it?"

"Well... I guess you have a point."

Grandpa and Grandma's feats were from quite a while ago. Those who have seen their battles in person are now few. So maybe it's about wanting to see the battles of the two they only know from stories.

"But the probability of them actually seeing it is quite low, right?"

"Even so. With such exceptional heroes fighting alongside us, it's a good enough reason for morale to soar."

Maria, who had been listening to the conversation with Og, chimed in.

"When Shin learned that your grandparents were joining the battle, the reactions from Marika-san and the others. That's the public's reaction. It's natural to want to see something you've never seen before."

"Even for ShiCecil?"

"Yes... well, I've become quite close with the two of them, but I've only seen them in combat once. So, there is a desire to see it."

"I see."

"But..."

"Hm?"

"I think of the two of them as family now, so my worry is stronger."

She wants to see it, but she's more worried about them being on the battlefield because they're already family.

So ShiCecil feels the same way.

"You should tell them that."

"I did, and they cried."

It had already been done.

But now, I can vividly imagine that situation.

"Did Grandpa cry while Grandma held you tight?"

"You were watching?"

"No?"

ShiCecil seems surprised, but it's just easy to imagine.

Grandpa and grandma don't see me with any special consideration as the hero's grandson but instead hold affection for me as an individual named Shin Wolford. So, rather than being asked by ShiCecil to show my power as a hero, they would express concern for my well-being.

They are likely to take such actions. And as I continued this conversation, I realized that the people around us were giving us warm looks.

"ShiCecil, you've already become a part of the Wolford family!"

"You know, she should just change her name to ShiCecil Wolford."

"A-Alice! L-Lynn! W-What are you doing!?"

ShiCecil, teased by Alice and Lynn, turned bright red.

She's really biting.

"But you know, it doesn't feel strange anymore, right?"

"That's right. I was looking forward to seeing Sage-sama and High Priest-sama in action, but ShiCecil-san is more concerned about their well-being... Certainly, it's like they're already family."

Yuri and Olivia seem to have no objections either.

"Umm, but! This kind of thing should be done after the ceremony..."

"Of course. You're taking this way too seriously."

While turning red, ShiCecil, who doesn't seem entirely opposed to the idea, received a retort from Maria.

"Ah, um..."

ShiCecil's face was now red enough to produce steam.

Changing one's last name after marriage in Earlshyde is a simple process; you just need to apply to the local government for changes in the resident registry. It's up to the couple whether they want to hold a wedding ceremony or not. In our case, the fact that Ecaterina the Pope would be officiating our wedding was revealed to the world. As a result, it feels like we have no choice but to have a wedding ceremony before applying at the local government office. In other words, for ShiCecil to become "ShiCecil Wolford," we have to win this battle and have Ecaterina the Pope officiate the wedding ceremony.

"I absolutely must win..."

While being teased by the women, I muttered without thinking, looking at ShiCecil who seemed somewhat happy. Hearing my mutter, Og, who had been looking serious until now, suddenly had a smirk on his face.

"What? What is it?"

"Well, isn't it okay? To secure victory for the sake of a woman, it's quite fitting for a story, don't you think?"

A story?

No way!?

"O- Og... you... you're not planning to turn this into a story, are you?"

With the thought that it couldn't be true, I asked. And then...

"Well, providing material for a story... I'd appreciate it."

"Ahh! Just as I thought!"

So that's what he was getting at with that smirk! If it's that author's style, it'll definitely turn into a scene that makes us blush just by watching it!

Oh no... What have I done by providing this topic?

"Well, anyway..."

"Your recovery time has been getting shorter recently. Boring."

"Hey! Well, whether it becomes a topic or not depends on the outcome of this battle. We have to win..."

"It's like a dream come true."

"That's right."

Now, it's about time I tried that trump card. I know I have to do it, but there's a part of me that hesitates.

Will it really work? If I make a mistake, I could end up causing a massive accident or even my own accidental death before the battle against Strom. But I have to do it.

(...Time to brace myself.)

I can't ask Og about this, so I keep it to myself. Once I make up my mind, I decide that I need to figure out where to perform this experiment. Since I can't have anyone see it, it has to be somewhere far away.

The location for the experiment... the sea.

I need to remain floating in the air for a long time, and having multiple floating spells active at once might disrupt my concentration. Maybe I should create a magical device for it. I don't need to rely on the Bean Workshop for this since it's just about applying a floating spell.

So, I've decided. I'll carry out the experiment tonight. I'll test the trump card magic. This is something necessary for world peace. That's what I kept telling myself.
