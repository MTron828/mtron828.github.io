"Damn brats... getting carried away..."

"Getting carried away? Don't say strange things. You guys are the ones who called it a game, right?"

"Grr, g-grrr..."

"This is the Imperial... no, the Magical Capital's city gate. Defeat those guarding it and proceed forward. It's a simple game!"

Oug said this and fired an enormous flame spell toward the city gate.

"Kuh!"

The power of that attack made the demons on the city walls instinctively jump back.

As a result, the magic exploded at the city gate with a loud noise.

The city gate was blown away completely.

"The... the city gate!"

"Hmm. Now we have the advantage."

"What!?"

The demons who had descended to the ground were surprised when they saw the blown-away city gate, but they turned back to Oug upon hearing his words.

"We don't need to bother fighting you guys diligently. Once we pass through the city gate, we're good. In exchange, you guys must not let a single one of us pass. Quite a handicap, isn't it?"

Well, that's true.

If even one of us manages to pass through the city gate, we're halfway to winning the game. In exchange, the demons must absolutely not let us pass. This is very inconvenient for the demons.

And there's another effect to this, I see.

(With this, the demons will gather in front of the city walls. No need to get surrounded.)

(That's what you were aiming for?)

(Well, yeah.)

Oug spoke in a low voice so that the demons couldn't hear. It's true, if we get surrounded, it will be troublesome.

"Darn it! We must not let them through! Respond to Strohm-sama's trust and Captain Zest!"

"Oorah!"

As expected, the demons gathered in front of the city gate and prepared to absolutely not let us through.

This is exactly what Oug was aiming for.

"Now then..."

Oug, who had been taking the lead at this location, began gathering magical power in both his hands.

"Commence the battle!"

Saying that, Oug rushed toward the demons first.

"We're going too!"

"Y-yeah!"

Seeing Oug charging, Maria and Miranda also rushed forward together.

"We're going as well!"

"Roger!"

Following that, it was Thor and Julius working as a team.

"Since our bodies warmed up a bit from before, I'm going too!"

"I'm going too!"

"I'm going too!"

"I'm in as well!"

And then, Tony, Yuri, Mark, who were originally planning to go solo, and Olivia, who was supposed to support everyone, followed suit.

As I watched everyone charging ahead, I remained still.

"Aren't you going, Shin-kun?"

"Hm?"

Seemingly concerned, Sisley asked.

"Oh, if it gets too dangerous, I'll join. But for now, it's also Oug's team's chance for revenge, and I thought I'd let everyone handle it at first."

That's right, last time, when we fought different demons, Oug's team lacked decisiveness, and the outcome remained uncertain. To counter that, we devised various strategies, and I initially wanted to entrust the battle to everyone.

I also believed that everyone's strategies would be more than sufficient.

"Hehe."

"What's so funny?"

As I explained all of this, Sisley laughed.

Why?

"No, it's just that I think Shin-kun trusts everyone."

Come to think of it, I vaguely remember having such a conversation last summer. Sisley told me that I don't have to carry everything on my own.

"Oh, I trust everyone. Also..."

"Yes?"

"Your healing magic, Sisley."

"Shin-kun..."

"Enhancement magic for combat is powerful, but it's not invincible. It's weak against unexpected attacks and counters. Against a group of demons like this, I might unexpectedly get injured. At that time, Sisley, I'll rely on you, okay?"

When I said that, Sisley's face lit up for a moment, then she tightened her expression.

"I'll do my best!"

"Great."

Now, I stayed behind on the spot for everyone's support, and Sisley remained to provide support and healing. As I looked toward where her gaze was focused...

"Cutey Red!"

"Cutey Blue!"

"Cutey Twins!"

"You... you're kidding me!!"

"..."

I couldn't believe I just witnessed such a ridiculous scene.

What are they doing during the battle?!
