"Is your sister the head of the trading company? She doesn't seem very old for that."

"Well, our father, who was originally the head, passed away in an accident, and my sister took over after that."

"Oh... I see."

So, Shaolin's father had passed away.

"I'm sorry for bringing up unpleasant memories."

"No, it's been three years already, so I don't mind. My sister, who took over after our father, reached out to various subordinates in the trading company dealing with dragon leather, just like our family, and she became the president of the Dragon Leather Association."

Wow, she managed to create and lead a union in just three years.

Shaolin's sister must be quite capable.

"However..."

Until a moment ago, Shaolin had been proudly talking about her sister's achievements, but her expression darkened.

"There has been a dispute over the position of the next union president after my sister fell ill."

"Well, that's a common occurrence."

"If it were only that... The union was already in turmoil, and then that bill was passed..."

"A bill?"

"Yes, that's... "

She had only mentioned it up to that point, but Shaolin's previously cloudy face became even more bitter.

"It forbids hunting dragons because of the fear of their extinction... not only that, but it also prohibits the trade of dragon leather."

"Huh?"

A ban on dragon hunting?

That's...

"Huh? Shaolin, doesn't that sound strange to you?"

Everyone was listening to Shaolin's story, and Alice raised a skeptical voice.

"Didn't you say earlier that dragons need to be hunted occasionally, or they'll multiply too much?"

Yes, when we saw the dragon leather earlier, she did mention that.

So, the fear of extinction?

"Yeah, it's strange. But the country issued such an edict."

Saying that with frustration, Shaolin lowered her head.

In the heavy atmosphere, Mark, who runs a workshop at his family's home, spoke to Shaolin.

"Um, didn't you protest or provide data on the number of dragons before it came to this?"

Bean Workshop deals with various materials.

Maybe they've had such experiences before.

In response to Mark's question, Shaolin looked embarrassed.

"Well, you see... as I mentioned earlier, the union was in a state of turmoil, and no one knew that such a bill was being discussed."

So the decision was made without even having time for discussion...

But really...

"What is the government thinking? How do they plan to take responsibility if dragons become overpopulated?"

This was the first time I had heard about this, and Aug seemed unusually angry.

But it's true.

Having faced dragon monsters myself, I understood. Even if they don't turn into monsters, regular people without combat abilities would be defenseless if attacked.

To leave that unaddressed...

It seemed like everyone else shared similar concerns, as they had solemn expressions.

However...

"Um, Shaolin, do you know the details of how this decision was made?"

"Yes... it was a complete surprise to us, and after the bill was passed, we went to the government to protest, but they didn't listen to us at all, and we ended up with a massive surplus of inventory."

"So there's no way to reverse it..."

"But!"

"Huh!"

Shaolin, who had been looking down, suddenly raised her head and held Sicily's hand.

"With Lady Sicily's power, if my sister can be revived, we can challenge the government! My sister has influence with the government, so she can advise them to reconsider the bill! So please, please!"

"Uh, okay, I'll do my best..."

"Please! Please..."

Watching Shaolin's increasingly emotional state, I placed my hand on Sicily's shoulder.

"It's a heavy responsibility."

"Yes. I'm sure we'll heal Shaolin's sister for her."

Sicily's expression was filled with determination.
