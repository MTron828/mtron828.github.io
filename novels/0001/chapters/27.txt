"Preparing for War.

Upon hearing those words, I looked around again. Everyone seemed anxious, discussing what would happen next and why they were suddenly starting a war.

'Preparing for war... Where are we going to war? In fact, hasn't war been a taboo since the massive invasion of monsters during the war with the Empire?'

'The Empire is our opponent.'

'The Empire? Why?'

'You'll have to ask the Empire about that. It seems they are making preparations for a large-scale expedition right now. It's said that they need extensive preparations to start a war with other smaller nations. So the target is...'

'The Grand Kingdom of Arlsheid, I suppose...'

The Empire is starting a war. Why? For what reason?

Well, the reason is understandable. If they can conquer the Grand Kingdom of Arlsheid, the Blusphere Empire will gain a significant boost in power, enough to potentially dominate the world. But why now? I don't understand the timing.

'Well, it hasn't started yet. If the war becomes a quagmire, students might be conscripted, but for now, there's no point in worrying. Especially for Shin, he probably won't be conscripted.'

'Why... Ah, he won't be used for military purposes, right?'

'Unless it's a demonic invasion. Using Shin in a war between nations is clearly military exploitation. I would never do such a thing.'

I looked around at Shishiri and everyone. They all had worried expressions.

'Certainly, there might be no conscription, but if a crisis approaches everyone, I'll go to the battlefield. Everyone I've met here is an irreplaceable friend.'

'Shin-kun...'

'Shin...'

It got a bit somber, but there's no use being depressed about something that hasn't happened yet.

'Alright! Let's all go to Mark's place. I remember today there's a prototype of weapons ready, and he asked us to come.'

'...That's right, I think it was today. Alright, let's go together.'

'While we're at it, let's buy accessories for everyone and enhance our defense. We need to be able to protect ourselves in case a war breaks out.'

Then, we entered a less crowded alley and opened a gate. After passing through the gate, we arrived at the Bean Workshop.

'It's really convenient. I want to learn it quickly.'

'...Lin, you have to make sure not to let your magic run wild.'

'...I'll do my best.'

And when we entered the workshop, Shin's father was waiting for us.

'Oh! You finally came, Shin! The prototypes are ready!'"

"...That's impressive, indeed. All right! From today, this sword is called the 'Exchange Sword'! Harold, make the order right away, okay?"

"Of course, Your Highness."

"Then, I'll send someone from the army's supply team later. Discuss the details, such as quantity, with the responsible person. This upcoming war will be its debut, so I'm counting on you."

"Yes, Your Highness!"

Then, they added magic to the new vibration sword and received a few replacement blades.

"I'm sorry, Father. I ended up taking all of them."

"No, no. His Highness asked you to properly invoice the kingdom for these, so don't worry about it, Shin."

"Og, I'm sorry."

"What's important is that we've obtained powerful weapons for the upcoming war. It's good that the development costs were this low."

I'm a bit anxious about the debut being in a war, but based on what I see, it should be fine.

The accessories were indeed given as gifts. Everyone felt a bit embarrassed, but it seems the reward this time was quite substantial, and Father just laughed it off.

For now, all the research club members decided to wear the accessories that enhance their defense. With this, our worries about defense have significantly decreased.

The soldiers of the Arlsheid Kingdom's army received new weapons. These weapons had an unfamiliar design.

Soldiers who took them in their hands shared their thoughts.

"Hey, have you tried the new swords?"

"Yeah, they have a sharp edge, but these are... definitely practical weapons."

"No decorations, they seem to prioritize practicality."

"Being able to exchange sword blades on the battlefield is certainly effective, but when we're issued with these..."

"I can't help but feel that the war is really about to begin."

There were no extravagant decorations. They were practical weapons meant for efficiently killing enemies by wearing out and swapping the sword blades. The soldiers had complex emotions, a mixture of exhilaration at obtaining powerful weapons and fear that the war was about to start.

And so, the supply of new weapons, the collection of necessary supplies, the summoning of soldiers scattered in various regions, keeping only the minimum personnel for dealing with monsters, and the recruitment of volunteers were completed, preparing for deployment at any time.

Then, a report came from the scouts hidden in the Empire.

"Report! The Blusphere Empire's army has started marching towards our country!"

Upon receiving that report, tension ran through the upper echelons gathered in the royal palace. However, there was no confusion since it had been anticipated, and the king issued a royal decree.

"Have you all heard? It seems the Empire lacks the ability to seize the moment. In response to such a foolish act, our kingdom will thoroughly resist! Let the Blusphere Kingdom show its strength to the Empire! All forces, march!"

Finally, the Empire had taken action. In response to their move, the kingdom reacted as well. There had been no declaration of war received yet. The kingdom presented it as a unilateral act of aggression by the Empire, justifying their military actions.

And this mobilization was also announced to the citizens of Arlsheid.

"So, the kingdom's army has finally been deployed."

When I arrived at the academy, Alice, who had already arrived, greeted me.

"That's right. The city was buzzing with that news."

The kingdom had made an official announcement, and there were even special editions of newspapers. So, the entire population was aware of it.

Since the war atmosphere had been building up, the commotion around me had calmed down, and I could now walk to school. I had observed the state of the city.

"So, how large of a mobilization did it turn out to be?"

"The Empire and the kingdom, both have deployed around eighty thousand troops."

"Hmm, it seems like they have almost equal military strength."

"But there's something strange about that."

"Strange?"

"Yeah, as of now, the total number of Imperial troops that we've managed to confirm is only eighty thousand."

"Total war, huh? The Empire seems desperate too."

"That's not it. To gather that total number, we had to resort to hiring mercenaries from volunteer forces and the Monster Hunter Association."

"Oh, I see. So, the Empire is really investing heavily in the military."

"No, the kingdom's army has almost the same number of troops."

"Huh? Then why are they hiring volunteers and mercenaries?"

"We didn't conscript the entire kingdom's army. We left behind the required number of personnel for dealing with monsters in various regions. We only gathered additional personnel because that wasn't enough."

"Huh? But isn't the Empire's army supposed to be their entire force? What about dealing with monsters?"

"That's why it's strange. The Empire is advancing toward the kingdom while neglecting the monsters. Why?"

"Maybe the Empire hired mercenaries too?"

"We confirmed that the Empire is not recruiting mercenaries. They also didn't conscript their entire army from various regions."

"Are they seriously ignoring the monsters?"

"What is the Empire thinking?"

Og fell into deep thought, and everyone else went silent.

"Could it be... that Strom is involved in this somehow?"

"What do you mean?"

"No, didn't Strom mention that he conducted various experiments? These experiments might have included the control of monsters."

"...I see. Strom was originally from the Empire. It's possible he might have been a spy sent by the Empire, not just a former member."

"In that case, the Empire can mobilize all their forces without worrying about the monsters."

"That's highly likely..."

"But, if that's the case, there might be some things we can't predict, right?"

"I thought it all made sense, though."

"What about the artificial magic-beings?"

"Oh... right, we haven't received any reports about that..."

"If there were magic-beings within the Empire's army, it would have caused a big commotion."

"Back to square one, huh?"

"Well, no matter how much we speculate here, it won't change anything. Let's focus on what we can do. We'll eventually understand the Empire's true intentions."

"...You're right. Let's focus on what we can do..."

"So, I'm thinking of starting practical magic practice soon. What do you think?"

"Will you finally teach us how to use the Gate?"

"Yeah, that's part of it."

"Lately, the power of my magic has been increasing! Is it because of the practice of magic control?"

Finally, everyone had improved their magic control enough to start practicing magic. When Grandpa used the Gate the other day, it boosted everyone's motivation to take magic control practice more seriously, and they seemed ready to learn magic.

"So, let's do our best in the research club today!"

"But we have classes first, Cornea."

"Oh! Right, I forgot."

"What are you guys doing here at the academy..."

Alfred-sensei sighed. We are attending classes, too, you know?

The kingdom's army had advanced near the border with the Empire. It was a place that had become a battlefield during past wars with the Empire. It was expected to become a battlefield again based on the Empire's army's movement.

On that day, in the main headquarters established in the camp of the army, General Dominic was organizing information brought by scouts.

The expected contact with the Empire's army would be in two days, and since the prospective battlefield was an open plain with good visibility, surprise attacks and encirclement tactics would be challenging. There was a high likelihood of a direct confrontation. Reports from scouts had also confirmed the absence of any separate detachments. Consequently, Dominic was finding it difficult to predict the Empire's intentions.

"...I don't understand. Even if there's a battle over there, what does the Empire gain from it? If they were planning to invade the kingdom, a surprise attack would be more efficient. Yet, information is leaking out, and they're not rushing their march for a surprise attack. They're advancing leisurely with a large army. Is the Empire really this foolish? Could there be some hidden agenda?"

"Thinking too deeply about it when we don't know anything won't get us anywhere. They might not be thinking much at all, just the foolish actions of a foolish emperor. It's a possibility."

"From the reports of the scouts, it seems like that possibility is the most likely... But it's just unbelievable."

"Well... I guess it's an unconventional military action even for the regular soldiers of the kingdom."

"It would be more reassuring if there were something hidden."

"But the entire Imperial army is advancing with 80,000 troops. No separate detachments have been confirmed. This is just the foolish act itself."

"Sigh... What on earth are they thinking..."

While Dominic was grappling with the uncertainty of the Empire's intentions, the Imperial army was also camped out, and they had received reports from their own scouts.

"I have a report. The kingdom's army is indeed struggling with monster-related issues and is having a hard time preparing their forces."

"I see, Your Majesty. It appears that the kingdom is indeed grappling with monster-related problems. If we advance with our large army as it is, we are sure to secure a great victory."

"Hmph, that's right. When I received the report that the number of monsters in the Empire was decreasing, and that of the kingdom was increasing, I became convinced. The kingdom is busy dealing with monsters, and they won't be able to withstand our fierce attack."

"As expected of you, Your Majesty."

Herald von Blusphia, the Emperor of the Blue Sphere Empire, had recently ascended to the throne. The Emperor's throne in the Empire was not hereditary. The Emperor was selected through an election by the aristocrats of the nobility, who were eligible to inherit the imperial throne.

As a result, bribery, favors, coercion, and various other tactics were rampant among the nobles in the Imperial Assembly, and there had never been a fair election. Herald used not only the Imperial Assembly but also engaged in harassment and covert operations against rival ducal houses to become the Emperor.

This earned him the enmity of many, but becoming the Emperor made it impossible for anyone to speak out against him.

Herald excelled at pushing others aside, but he was completely inept in matters of politics. He only trusted reports that suited him and suppressed those that did not. Moreover, he had a strong sense of self-importance, and invading the kingdom had been his long-cherished desire.

Of course, it was for the purpose of glorifying himself.

Thus, this man was pushing the kingdom's army into dealing with monsters and focusing on their military, and reports came in that the number of monsters in the Empire was decreasing.

Upon hearing the report, images of the Kingdom collapsing under the Empire's offensive while being unable to deal with it flashed through Herald's mind.

To take control of the Kingdom.

Once he had glimpsed the possibility, he couldn't stop himself. Even after the march began, the reports coming in were all in favor of the Empire.

Herald was completely convinced of his victory.

The man who reported to the Imperial headquarters, Zest, left the tent, glaring at it.

The following day, both armies began their advance, and two days later, they finally confronted each other.

This took the Imperial army by surprise. According to the information they had received, the Kingdom's army was supposed to be busy dealing with a massive increase in domestic monsters and shouldn't be here.

"What's going on? The Kingdom's army is completely ready for us!"

"Fetch Zest! Fetch Zest now!"

"That... that's..."

"What is it!?"

"We haven't seen Zest since last night. Furthermore, we've lost contact with the reconnaissance units he was leading..."

"What?!?"

"Your Majesty! We have no choice but to retreat at this point! We have a massive army invading the Kingdom's territory. This is reason enough for the Kingdom's army to attack us. We have no other option but to press forward!"

"You... Those reconnaissance units are just a bunch of civilians! How dare they plot against me, a noble! Inform the entire army! We were planning to eliminate the Kingdom's army anyway! It's just a matter of sooner or later! Let's show our power to the Kingdom's army! All forces, charge!"

The Imperial army launched their assault. In response, within the Kingdom's army...

"They've actually started their assault. What are they thinking, those guys?"

The Commander of the Mage Corps, Ruper, voiced his disbelief.

"All right, the Mage Corps should unleash the initial attack as planned!"

A massive wave of magic was unleashed from the Kingdom's Mage Corps. It rained down on the Imperial army, which had charged en masse, causing casualties. Normally, at the start of a battle, there would be a magical exchange between the Mage Corps before knights and soldiers would charge. But for the Imperial army, this battle was unexpected. The command structure was in disarray, turning them into a disorganized mob, and they became easy targets for the Kingdom's Mage Corps.

Despite that, some of them survived and advanced closer to the Kingdom's army.

"No need to be straightforward and clash head-on. Right and left wings, move around to the Empire's flanks! The center, hold off the Imperial army!"

"Wow!"

While the Empire's army was thrown into chaos due to the unexpected turn of events, the Kingdom's army, which was thoroughly prepared, deployed its formation to partially encircle the Imperial army. Finally, the two armies clashed.

The Imperial army, already damaged by magic, was completely halted by the Kingdom's forces and couldn't break through. They were further attacked from both sides, leaving the Imperial army with no choice but to reduce their numbers. Until shortly before nightfall, the Imperial army continued to suffer losses.

The delay in the retreat was due to Emperor Herald's refusal to retreat out of his pride.

The 80,000-strong Imperial army had lost nearly half its number in just one battle, resulting in a major defeat for the Empire, while the Kingdom's losses were slightly over a hundred.

At the end of the first day of battle, Herald was furious in his headquarters.

"What is this disaster? This will only increase our losses!"

Within the tent, Herald was in a rage. However, no one by his side could stop him. Intervening at this point would likely lead to being killed.

In the end, Herald continued to be agitated, but he didn't decide on any concrete solution.

This situation had arisen because all the reports from the reconnaissance units had been lies. Someone had sensed an intent to harm the Empire but couldn't do anything.

The Emperor was the one to decide on the strategy, and making suggestions or proposing plans would only incur the wrath of the proud Emperor.

His advisors spent a sleepless night, filled with despair-like feelings.

Meanwhile, in the Kingdom's army, discussions were taking place about the day's battle.

"Ruper was right. The foolish Emperor made a foolish advance and fought a foolish battle. Frankly, I can't think of anything else."

"Yeah, it's unbelievable."

"Will it be the same tomorrow?"

"I think that's highly likely."

The Kingdom's commanders sighed in a way that had a different meaning than that of the Imperial army.

Now, let's go back in time a bit to the moment when the Imperial and Kingdom armies began their battle. The scouts witnessed something unbelievable and quickly left the scene to report.

"That's... ridiculous!"

Uttering these words, they urged their horses at full speed to deliver this information as soon as possible.

In the end, starting from the second day, the Imperial army continued to launch assaults, and by the end of the third day, their force of 80,000 had dwindled to less than 20,000. A sense of resignation had taken hold of the Imperial army.

Then, on the morning of the fourth day, both armies received some crucial information.

"Report!"

"What's wrong?"

Seeing the unusual expression of the scout, Dominic sensed that something had happened. The content of the report was astonishing.

"Monsters... a large number of monsters have appeared!"

"What?"

"Medium-sized or larger monsters have appeared in large numbers and have started invading! And their destination is... the 'Imperial Capital of Bluesphere'!"

"What!?"

"And..."

"Is there more?"

"We've also sighted numerous 'magical beings'!"

"What?!"

This report was also conveyed to the Imperial army.

"What nonsense?! Weren't there supposed to be fewer monsters?"

"Your Majesty, this is no longer about advancing towards the Kingdom! We must return to the capital immediately!"

"You fool! Do you mean to say that mere monsters are attacking my capital? Ridiculous! I declare to all forces! We have no time to deal with the Kingdom's army! Hurry back to the capital and eliminate those monsters!"

Herald announced to the entire army with a face red with anger. The Imperial army immediately reversed its course and began heading back to the capital.

Meanwhile, the Kingdom's army was uncertain about its next course of action. The choice was between continuing the advance toward the Imperial capital or returning to the Kingdom.

"Wouldn't it be better to turn back at this point?"

"No, if even magical beings are involved, leaving them alone could be dangerous. Maybe we should temporarily join forces with the Empire to defeat the magical beings?"

"But will the Empire accept us?"

"They'll probably have to accept that much, right?"

"I'm not so sure. After we defeat the monsters, they might turn their blades on us."

"That possibility does exist."

The hastily convened meeting did not make much progress, so the decision was left to Dominic.

"Leaving the magical beings alone is dangerous. We need to defeat them now. However, there's also the possibility that the Empire won't accept us. So, we will position ourselves behind the Imperial army and first assess the situation. If the Imperial army can defeat the magical beings as is, that's good. If it's difficult, we'll advance as reinforcements. Given the current circumstances, I think this is the best we can do. What do you think?"

"That sounds fine, doesn't it? I can't come up with a better plan."

"Alright, then, let's head toward the capital..."

"It's... it's a disaster! Monsters are heading towards us in large numbers!"

"What? What about the magical beings? Are they there?"

"N-no! There have been no sightings of magical beings! But... their numbers are staggering!"

"What's the breakdown?"

"Mostly small to medium-sized monsters. There are hardly any large ones!"

"Then we might be able to handle this... Inform the entire army! Eradicate the monsters immediately! After dealing with the monsters, we will resume our march towards the capital! Move out!"

"Yes, sir!"

And thus, the Kingdom's army found itself in battle against the massed monsters. While most of these monsters were small to medium-sized, their sheer numbers made their elimination a time-consuming process.

In terms of casualties, there were hardly any. Some soldiers suffered minor injuries, while a few sustained more serious injuries like fractures and lacerations. However, this came after three days of battling the Imperial army, which had left everyone considerably fatigued.

By the time they finished exterminating the monsters, it was already nightfall.

"Darn it! We won't be able to march until dawn with this situation!"

"That's right. Night marches with such a large army would be too demanding. Plus, we just faced that massive horde of monsters. We must be pretty exhausted by now."

"What kind of situation is this? It's like being held hostage!"

"...It might actually be just that."

And so, the Kingdom's army was immobilized by the monsters, forced to wait until morning before continuing their journey.

Meanwhile, the Imperial capital, besieged by the swarm of monsters, was rapidly overrun. The forces that should have protected the city were absent, and the gathered monsters consisted mainly of medium to large-sized creatures, including disaster-level beasts like tigers and lions. With the presence of magical beings mixed in, the city's inhabitants had no means to resist.

What followed was a nightmarish scene of wailing and chaos.

The citizens of the capital were killed, devoured, and incinerated by the magical powers of the magical beings.

There were even some monster hunters who had remained in the capital, but with their numbers so great and magical beings in the mix, they were helpless and quickly met their end.

Amid this hellish scene, there was one individual strolling calmly.

"How are you feeling, Ms. Miria? Any impressions of becoming a magical being?"

"Yes, Lord Strohm. I've never felt such overflowing power before. Moreover, I feel like I can use any magic right now."

"Heh, that's good to hear. Nevertheless, you seem remarkably composed considering that your own country's citizens are being killed."

"These Imperial capital citizens used to look down on the surrounding Imperial citizens, thinking they were the chosen ones. In fact, I, too, have been subjected to countless insults from such commoners. I don't feel the slightest remorse for them, no matter how many of them are killed."

"Hahaha, is that so? That's wonderful, Miria. After all, these people are nothing but scum."

"Thank you for your praise."

"Now then, it'll be two or three days until the troops sent out return. By then, the capital will be completely ours. Zest should return as well, so should we prepare to confront the Imperial army?"

"Yes, Lord Strohm."

"Now, let's see how much the Kingdom's army managed to reduce their numbers."

And so, the two of them continued walking toward the Imperial capital.

As they did, they heard the agonized cries of the citizens of the capital.

Three days after Strohm's attack on the capital, the Imperial army finally reached the city. What they saw was a destroyed capital overrun by a multitude of monsters.

"You vile creatures! Dispatch every last one of them!"

With Herold's command, the Imperial army charged once more. Initially, they managed to eliminate the monsters, but when the magical beings appeared, the situation took a drastic turn.

The Imperial army was overwhelmed by the magical beings' magic. Among these magical beings were the reconnaissance units led by Zest, who had fed the Imperial army false information.

"Zest! It's your fault! All your fault!"

Herold yelled at Zest as if he had gone mad. However, Zest paid him no heed and continued slaughtering the Imperial soldiers.

And... even the Emperor, who couldn't even discern who had killed him, was trampled to death. The Imperial army was literally annihilated.

When the Kingdom's army, which had been delayed by the monsters, arrived and witnessed the scene, they saw the remnants of the completely destroyed Imperial army.

Someone approached the stunned Kingdom's army and spoke to them.

"Oh, is that you, the one who has helped us in the Kingdom?"

It was Strohm's voice, the one they had heard at the training ground in the security bureau. They looked around but couldn't spot Strohm anywhere. He was likely using some sort of magical communication.

"Oh, dear me, with such meager strength, you won't be able to destroy us, you know? How about seeking cooperation with other nations?"

It sounded as if he was mocking them.

"Oh, yes, indeed, thank you for reducing the number of Imperial troops. Thanks to you, we were able to easily annihilate the Imperial army."

Dominic realized they had also been manipulated by Strohm, and he felt an overwhelming anger rising within him, but he managed to control it. Following Strohm's suggestion, they returned to the Kingdom and decided that they needed to seek cooperation from other nations. They then returned to the Kingdom.

Upon their return, the upper echelons of the Kingdom were shocked by the report from Dominic. They decided that they could no longer keep Strohm's information secret, including the events of this incident, and chose to make it public to the citizens.

The content of the announcement was as follows:

"The incident with the emergence of magical beings in the capital city was caused by a rational magical being named Oliver Strohm. This individual, along with a multitude of magical beings he created, including a large number of monsters, attacked and destroyed the Imperial capital of the Bluesphere Empire. The entire series of conflicts, including this incident, were all caused by this individual."a database schema
