The first thing we headed towards after parting ways with Aug and the others was something that had piqued my curiosity for a while.

"What is this, I wonder?"

Sicily seemed to have no idea what this was at all.

And that's no surprise because this is something that doesn't exist in the current world.

It's an automobile.

"Probably some kind of vehicle," I said, adding "probably" because this is something that doesn't exist in this world.

"Huh? But aren't these wheels too small?"

The car, which had been left alone for years, had deteriorated rubber on the tires. The deteriorated and damaged tires were probably removed during excavation, leaving only the wheels.

The interior was also in poor condition, but the metal parts, despite showing signs of corrosion and deterioration, still retained their shape.

"Besides, it doesn't have any horses to pull it, right?"

Sicily equated vehicles with horse-drawn carriages in her mind. Perhaps the people of Quanlong thought the same way, which is why it had been abandoned.

"I think it might be self-propelled."

"Self-propelled... Come to think of it, Shin mentioned before that he wanted to create a self-propelled vehicle..."

Sicily said that and then looked at me before letting out a sigh.

"So, you're planning to imitate it, aren't you?"

"..." I averted my gaze.

"As I thought..."

"Well, it's almost the same as what I had in mind. I wouldn't say 'imitate,' but more like using it as a reference..."

"In any case, you're going to make it, right? Even if you get scolded by Grandma again?"

Sicily was exasperated but didn't oppose the idea.

She really does understand me well.

"Even if you say not to do it, I'm going to make it anyway, so I might as well not ask for Grandma's permission, right?"

"...Really?"

"How many times have you been scolded for it?"

I had thought of making it secretly since I was sure I'd be scolded if I mentioned it.

...Either way, it seems I'll be scolded.

"Well, let's think about that later. For now, let's analyze this."

"Honestly..."

As expected, there was a caliper installed to cover the brake disc. There should be a hose coming out of it, but it seems to have deteriorated and disappeared. However, that doesn't matter. The caliper I wanted so badly was right in front of me.

"Can I take this with me?"

"I think you'll get scolded if you take it without saying anything."

"Yeah, you're right... Maybe I should ask Shaolin."

I called out to Shaolin, who I had just parted ways with, and to one of the surveyors.

"Is this...?"

"Yes."

"We don't know what to do with this. Did you figure out what it is!?"

Uh-oh. I might have spilled the beans.

"Shin-dono... I see you're still..."

Since I had Shaolin translating for me, the conversation was not private. That's why I was being looked at strangely.

Wait, didn't we resolve this earlier!?

"Indeed, your memories of the pre-civilization era..."

"N-No! It's just that this resembled something I wanted to make! That's why I thought that way!"

"I see... This is the first time I've heard of it."

Og! Why are you here!?

"I had a bad feeling about bringing Shaolin-dono after what happened earlier. When I came to check..."

"Shin-dono! What were you planning? What exactly were you trying to make!?"

While Og had an exasperated expression, Thor had a desperate look on his face.

He's the future lord of the industrial city, after all.

Every time I make something, it's like this.

But this time, I can't just ignore Thor.

"Well, um... I wanted to make a self-propelled vehicle..."

I said that, and Og let out a heavy sigh.

"You... Just a little. Just a little, right? Why does something like this happen in the brief moment I look away from you!?"

"A self-propelled vehicle... Shin-dono! Are you planning to bankrupt the horse ranch!?"

"I don't intend to do that! I was planning to discuss it!"

"Are you planning to keep me busy one after another?"

"No, no. I don't intend to do that, but..."

"Then what do you intend to do?"

"I... Just wanted to take it for a little ride."

When I said that, Og's temple started pulsating with a vein.

"When are you going to learn self-restraint and common sense, damn it!!"

"I-I haven't been reckless in making it!"

"You're trying to obtain permission to take relics for the purpose of making it right now, aren't you?"

"I won't publicize it! I promise it's for my personal use!"

I desperately pleaded.

As a result, permission was granted on the condition that Og would monitor to ensure it wouldn't be exposed to the public eye.

"Thank you!"

"Just to make it clear, it's the archaeologist who will grant permission for the removal. If it gets rejected, don't push it."

"I understand!"

With Og's permission, I beamed with a big smile and looked at the archaeologist. The archaeologist, who had been listening to our conversation through Shaolin's translation, had a contorted expression.

"Yes, well... It's not a weapon, and it has been left untouched for many years, so it doesn't really matter."

Yes!! Permission granted!!

"Thank you so much!!"

Overjoyed, I shouted my gratitude and ran back to where the car was.

"Hey! Wait for me, Shin-kun!"

Sicily followed after me.

"You granted permission quite easily."

After Shin ran off, Thor spoke to August.

August, who had been approached, furrowed his brows but eventually sighed in resignation.

"What he creates may be extravagant, but it often turns out to be highly useful. This wireless communication device is no exception, right? We can't afford to part with it anymore. We'll consider whether to release it later. First, let him create it, and then we'll decide."

August may lecture Shin on various matters, but in reality, he has benefited significantly from Shin's magical tools. Despite the recurring challenges in maintenance, it would be a lie to say that he isn't interested in the magical devices Shin creates.

"If he's allowed to create it, and there are issues with its public release, we can simply refrain from doing so."

"I have no objections to allowing him."

"...I can't help but feel that he would secretly create it if we forbid it. So, I think it's safer to have him develop it under my supervision."

August's words easily led to a future where Shin would secretly create something and present the finished product suddenly.

"It's possible."

"In fact, it's almost certain."

The three of them exchanged glances and collectively let out a deep sigh.

Returning to the car he had seen earlier, Shin immediately stored the entire car in his extradimensional storage.

He planned to take it back and dismantle it at Bean Workshop. With the finished product, the workshop members would likely be able to replicate the propulsion system, and they could finally analyze the problematic brakes!

Wasn't this the biggest achievement since coming to Quanlong?

"Already... Are you planning to lock yourself up in Bean Workshop when you get back?"

"Huh?"

Why did Sicily know? Startled, Shin looked at Sicily, who puffed out her cheeks.

"Are you planning to neglect me and Silver?"

"I won't do that!"

"Really? It's a promise, you know?"

"I understand!"

That was close...

He had gotten too excited, and if not for Sicily and Silver reminding him, he might have neglected them.

He decided to temper his enthusiasm for disassembling and analyzing the car.

But still, it was an incredible harvest. To obtain a sample of the long-awaited brakes!

The reincarnator from the pre-civilization era did a great job... Well, maybe not entirely, since he created weapons of mass destruction that could destroy the world.

It all started as a whim from Tony for an archaeological tour, but it turned out to be unexpectedly meaningful.

They had learned about the existence of a reincarnator from the pre-civilization era and had a rough idea of why the pre-civilization era had come to an end.

And most importantly, the brakes...

"Uh..."

Then, Shin suddenly realized.

Cars, reinforced concrete skyscrapers, asphalt-covered roads.

Weapons like railguns, airplanes.

The pinnacle of weapons of mass destruction.

Come to think of it, Shaolin had something like a laser gun.

Did the reincarnator create all of these?

Shin had never been involved in construction, so he didn't possess the knowledge or technology to build skyscrapers vertically.

I know that asphalt is naturally extracted, but it should be artificially created when used for roads. I can't even imagine the process of making it. Did one person have all this knowledge?

"No..."

I glanced over the ruins once more, a scene eerily similar to my past life. Did one reincarnator create all of this?

The moment I had doubts about it, I came up with a hypothesis. Perhaps there were multiple reincarnators? If I considered it this way, this grand spectacle made more sense. People who had worked in various professions, from construction to vehicle maintenance to road paving, had recalled their memories from their past lives...

But, wasn't it too convenient for multiple reincarnators to be found? Since I came to this world, I hadn't encountered anyone with memories from their past lives in this era. While there were a few individuals in history who seemed likely, only one had definitive evidence: the diary I saw with my grandmother.

Several reincarnators, such a rare occurrence... It didn't seem realistic.

Suddenly, a horrifying thought crossed my mind. Could it be that the pre-civilization era executed what I hypothesized before? "Rarely, when a child survives on the brink of death during their early years, they may occasionally recall memories from their past lives." Perhaps the people of the pre-civilization era had realized this and put it into practice. As a result, many people remembered their past lives, and if those reincarnators tried to stand out from the rest...

It must have spiraled out of control.

No, it probably did spiral out of control. Looking at the collapsed city, I felt like I caught a glimpse of the darkness of the pre-civilization era.
