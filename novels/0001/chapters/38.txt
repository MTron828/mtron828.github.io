As Merlin expressed gratitude to the men in the research group and shed tears in front of Shin, what was happening in the women's bath?

"Wow... Merida-sama, you're amazing..."

"Indeed... I hope it's not impolite to ask, but you must be over sixty, right?"

"I'm about to reach seventy soon."

"And yet your body... it's unfair!"

The women in the dressing room, having removed their clothing, were astonished as they gazed at Merida's body.

Already past sixty and approaching seventy, there was no sign of aging in her body.

The women were very curious about how she maintained her body, and they lamented the injustice as they looked at their own bodies.

Meanwhile, Merida was enjoying the hot spring without any concern.

"Ah... it really soaks into your bones..."

"That's true... I guess I was more tired than I thought."

"Hehe, I'm glad you like it."

"This is great. The best."

The women, too, were not making much noise due to the fatigue from their long journey and the presence of Merida as their guardian.

As they enjoyed the bath and began to relax, their curiosity turned toward Merida once again.

Maria, who couldn't resist her curiosity any longer, had a question.

"Do you do something special in your daily life, Merida-sama?"

"Hmm? Not really... Oh, now that you mention it, Shin said it's better to stay active, so I use some exercise equipment we have at home."

"Exercise equipment?"

"Yeah, that kid comes up with all sorts of stuff, but sometimes he creates really useful things. It's like equipment that starts moving when you touch it with magic power. There are things like a device you stand on that moves automatically as you walk or run, and another one that gradually increases the resistance. Each of them has an enhancement for natural recovery, so the effects show up quickly."

"The effects show up quickly!?"

"Is that for real!?"

"Yeah, I don't know why it works that way. Thanks to it, my stamina and muscle strength have improved significantly. At this rate, I might live up to around 150 years or so."

Merida said this with a smile, but the other women had serious expressions, especially Alice and Rin.

"Merida-sama! Um, could we use that equipment, please?"

"I want to use it too."

As they made their request, Merida looked at the bodies of the two and uttered words of despair.

"I don't mind, but exercising won't make your breasts bigger, you know?"

"Huh?"

"Is that so?"

"Actually, if you exercise too much, your breasts might get smaller."

"What!?"

"Th-that's...!?"

Despair overcame the two upon hearing Merida's words.

And those words piqued the interest of others who started asking questions.

"What do you mean by 'exercise too much makes your breasts smaller'?"

"Oh, Shin mentioned it. When you exercise, your body loses fat, right?"

"I see."

"That makes sense."

"This meat here..."

They switched to a different topic.

"So, since breasts are made of fat, exercising too much, especially all-over body exercise, can reduce the fat in the breasts."

"Wow, is that so?"

"So that means... with some exercise, one can have an amazing body like Merida-sama!"

It seemed that fat reduction was a perpetual concern for women.

"But seriously... how does Shin know all this?"

"Yeah, he knows so many things, even when teaching us how to imagine using magic."

Maria and Sicily were curious and asked Merida.

"That's true... Merlin said the same thing, but he's a kid who questions and is curious about everything. Why does fire burn? Why does the wind blow? What is water made of? Why does water turn into ice? What is the body made of? How does it move? He must have investigated all these things."

Merida reminisced while speaking.

"He used to run around hunting in the forest from the age of five."

"F-five!?"

"I can't believe it."

"Unbelievable. Truly, young Shin is amazing."

The people could easily imagine the scene and chuckled.

"He was an exceptionally fast learner from a young age, but I was worried, especially since he was running around freely in the forest. I even thought about going to look for him. One day, when Shin went missing, I questioned Merlin, and he said Shin had gone hunting in the forest. I almost scolded Merlin for it."

"Ha-ha..."

They chuckled at the image they could easily imagine.

"From a young age, he had a phenomenal memory, but I was somewhat worried. I didn't realize it was so extraordinary, though."

"Did Merlin-sama not notice?"

"That original, no self-control guy? Not only did he not notice, but since Shin quickly learned magic, he kept teaching him one spell after another. Merlin is undoubtedly the main culprit in all of this."

They couldn't help but smile at the unexpected side of the person known as a wise sage in the world.

"But, thanks to that, we can deal with this situation. I never dreamed that such a thing would happen."

"So, Merida-sama, please don't worry too much. Shin-kun will surely become a hero who saves the world."

Merida looked intently at Sicily after hearing those words.

"You're a good girl, after all. I'll count on you to take care of Shin from now on. Make sure he doesn't go down the wrong path."

"Yes! Leave it to me!"

Sicily responded to Merida.

"By the way, Shin-kun's healing magic is also incredible. Did he learn that on his own too?"

"Yeah, he dissected the animals he hunted in the forest. That's how he must have learned the anatomy of living creatures."

They couldn't have imagined he already knew about human anatomy, so they came up with a plausible explanation and were satisfied.

"But still, it feels like we've figured out the reason for Shin's extraordinary magic."

"It's a bit lonely that he was playing alone because he didn't have friends."

"So, he's concerned about the well-being of his companions. He didn't have any friends..."

Everyone agreed that Shin's unique magic and his attentiveness to his friends were due to the fact that he didn't have any friends.

"That's why, you know, I'm grateful to all of you."

"Merida-sama?"

"He didn't have friends his age. It was always just adults around him. He used to say he wasn't lonely because we were there, but when I see how he acts when he's with all of you... I can't help but think that he really needed friends."

They listened silently to Merida's confession about regretting letting Shin be alone in the forest until he became an adult.

"So, I'm really happy that all of you are Shin's friends now... Thank you so much."

She said this and bowed her head to everyone.

"Merida-sama, please raise your head. I'm the one who thinks I'm really fortunate to have met Shin-kun."

"That's right, rather, it's us who are lucky to have become friends with Shin."

"Yeah, super lucky."

"Lyn, calling it lucky..."

"But it's true, isn't it? We're the ones who gained the most by getting to know Wolford-kun."

"That's absolutely true!"

"You all..."

Merida's gratitude grew as she heard the words from the women, and to express her gratitude, she made a proposal.

"Alright! I was planning not to interfere as a guardian during this training camp, but we've decided that we'll also help train all of you!"

"Eh!? Merida-sama and Merlin-sama!?"

"Is that really true!?"

"Yeah, but be prepared because we'll push you hard."

"Yes!"

"As you wish."

"Hehe, it sounds like it's going to be fun."

With that, they laughed, and the women had a mix of slight anxiety and great anticipation for what was to come.
