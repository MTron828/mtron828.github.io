"Ah, have things finally settled down?"

I muttered to myself while sitting at my desk in the Ultimate Magicians' office.

As for Darum, the leaders of various countries, including Ekaterina, have taken over, so there's nothing left for me to do. While I have various responsibilities within the Arxheid nation, most of them are running smoothly, and things have started to move even without my direct involvement.

My current job mainly involves handling approvals. I'm being dispatched as part of the Ultimate Magicians' active unit less frequently, and I'm starting to feel a sense of calm.

After signing the approval documents for today, I glanced around the office.

Despite the increase in staff, the population density in the office had decreased due to a reduced individual workload, creating a more relaxed atmosphere.

While nodding in approval of the excellent work done by the staff, my radio communication device rang.

"Yes, this is Shin."

Receiving a call on the radio at this hour could mean that there was trouble at work. Thinking that, I answered, but it was an unexpected caller.

"Ah, Shin-kun. I'm sorry to bother you while you're at work. It's Cecily."

It was Cecily, who was currently on maternity leave and at home.

"Oh, I just finished up some work, so it's fine. What's going on?"

"Is that so? Well...," Cecily hesitated as she began to speak.

"Is it about Silver?"

"Yes. I received a call from the academy saying he wasn't feeling well and came home early. But even after applying healing magic, he's not getting better. I'm not sure what to do."

Cecily is known as a skilled mage specializing in healing magic. It was concerning that her healing magic didn't work. Moreover, it was her own child, which made her worry and reach out to me.

"So Cecily's healing magic didn't work..."

"Yes... that's why I thought maybe you could help."

Cecily's voice over the communication device sounded weak and full of worry. Naturally, I was also concerned about Silver's condition.

"Understood. I don't have any urgent tasks right now, so I'll leave work early too."

"I'm sorry... for causing trouble."

"It's not a bother at all when it's about family. I'll be home soon."

"Okay. Thank you."

After ending the call, I immediately approached Katarina.

"Katarina."

"Yes. What's the matter?"

Katarina, who had become something of a representative for the Ultimate Magicians' office staff, quickly came to me.

"I just got a call from Cecily. It seems Silver isn't feeling well and came home early."

"Silver, really?"

"Yeah, and it seems Cecily's healing magic isn't working, so I'm going to leave work early to see how he's doing."

As I said that, not only Katarina but the entire office seemed to be in turmoil.

"C-Cecily's healing magic isn't working!?"

"That's... could it be an incurable disease!?"

"No way... such a disease exists?"

Hmm...

It's clear how much trust there is in Cecily's abilities as a saint. The perception seems to be that if her healing magic doesn't work, there's no hope. In reality, it's not always the case.

"Well, that's how it is. I'm counting on you from here."

"Okay... please, take care and don't lose heart."

Katarina looked at me with a worried expression, making me a bit anxious. So, I promptly opened a gate and returned home.

When I got home, Marika noticed my presence and hurried over.

"Master!"

"I'm back, Marika. How's Silver?"

"He's resting in his room."

"I see. And Cecily?"

"Yes, she's with him."

"Got it."

I said that and headed to Silver's room.

I knocked on Silver's room door, and I heard a response from Cecily inside.

Gently opening the door, I saw Silver lying in bed, Cecily sitting on a chair next to the bed, and Shal sitting on Cecily's lap.

"Daddy!"

Shal, upon seeing me, jumped from Cecily's lap and ran to me.

"Daddy! Big brother is going to die! Please help big brother!"

Shal pleaded with me, her face distorted in sorrow, tears streaming down.

Your beloved big brother must be really worrying you.

I picked up Shal and patted her back to reassure her.

"Don't worry. Daddy will help him."

"Really?"

"Yeah. So, relax."

I said that, and Shal wiped away her tears and nodded, saying, "Okay!"

I approached Silver, who was lying in bed, and asked Cecily about the situation.

"Is there anything physically wrong?"

"That's the thing... even after examining every part of his body with my healing magic, I couldn't find anything wrong. But his complexion is clearly pale, and his condition isn't improving."

Cecily can use a scanning magic I taught her before applying healing magic, which has become quite accurate by now. If Cecily couldn't find any abnormalities, there likely weren't any physical issues.

In that case...

"Silver, are you awake?"

When I called out, Silver, who had been lying in bed, stirred and turned to face me.

His complexion was clearly pale, and it was easy to see that he was unwell.

We need to investigate what's happened as soon as possible.

So, I asked Silver:

"Did something happen at the academy? Something unpleasant?"

If there were no physical abnormalities, it seemed that the cause might be psychological. I asked with that in mind, and it seemed I hit the mark, as Silver's body tensed visibly.

I tried to soothe Silver and sat on the bed, stroking his head.

At that moment, Silver's body stiffened.

"Silver?"

"..."

It was as if he was rejecting me, and although I called out to him, he didn't respond.

It would be unwise to press him for answers, so I decided to simply stroke Silver's head in silence.

Cecily and Shal also understood the situation and remained quiet. Some time passed in silence.

After a while, Silver's body finally relaxed, and he turned to face me.

"Dad..."

"Hmm? What is it?"

He wants to convey something.

But he can't seem to say it, with an expression that suggests as much.

I want to ask right away, but I shouldn't rush things here.

I patiently waited while stroking Silver's head until he felt like talking.

Finally, it seemed he had made up his mind, and Silver began to speak.

"Dad... am I... not really your child?"

...So that's it.

The miraculous child who survived the War of the Demon King and was taken in by me and Cecily.

The fact that Silver isn't our biological child is well-known in society. However, since the stories involving me and Cecily are too embarrassing to be shared with Silver and the others, he didn't know about this fact.

For Silver, who sees me and Cecily as his father and mother, this is a heavy revelation, so we had been cautious about when to tell him.

"...Who told you this?"

"My classmate at the academy... they told me not to get cocky just because I'm an adopted child."

...

Which little brat said that?

What should I do...

"Daddy?"

"...Papa, you're scary."

"Oh, sorry."

As I contemplated what to do with that little brat, the kids got scared. Phew, this isn't good. They're just kids.

Right now, it's about Silver, not delivering a stern protest to such a child.

"Silver."

...

When I called out to him, Silver stared at me in silence.

I took a deep breath and told Silver, "Certainly, Silver is not our child."

"!"

Upon hearing that, Silver's face contorted, and tears welled up in his eyes. It must be a shock.

So, I and Cecily had been carefully considering the timing of when to tell him.

However, once it's out, there's no going back.

I decided to tell Silver the fact that is widely known in the world.

"Listen, Silver. The thing is, you're not our child... and actually, most people out there already know about it."

"...Huh?"

This must be a shocking revelation for Silver, but it's a widely known fact in the general public. He opened his eyes wide in surprise.

"Do you know that there are books about your parents circulating in the world?"

"Yeah. The book that Dad and Mom didn't let me read because it's embarrassing."

"Oh, well, that's true. Actually, in that book, there's even a baby Silver."

"...Huh?"

Now Silver had a surprised expression.

That's understandable. To suddenly find out that he appeared in a book he had no knowledge of is quite shocking.

I told Silver a slightly different version of the story known to the public, as it was written in that book.

I honestly explained how I had received Silver from his dying mother, Milia.

I told him about naming the baby Silver Sylvester.

I mentioned how she had asked for him to be happy and how Cecily had readily agreed to raise him as her own, and I had also supported the decision.

I informed him that from then on, Cecily and I had wholeheartedly raised Silver.

While I spoke, Silver listened attentively to my words.

"Silver might not remember because you were a baby, but your real mother loved you. We received that love like a baton."

...

Silver seemed to have been hurt when he was called an "adopted child" at the academy.

If that's the case, it's important to convey that Silver wasn't an adopted child. He was entrusted by his real mother, who loved him and wanted him to be happy just before her death.

Upon hearing my words, Silver's expression changed from the one he had when he seemed to reject us earlier. He now appeared to be deep in thought, likely trying to process my words in his own way.

"Hey, Silver."

"...What?"

"Were we not your Dad and Mom?"

"N-No way!"

In response to my question, Silver quickly denied it.

Thank goodness.

We had raised Silver as our own child, and I was confident that our love had undoubtedly reached him.

That's why I asked the question. If he had said something like "a bit different," I'm pretty sure I would have been downcast for a few days.

Perhaps Silver felt embarrassed for spontaneously shouting, as his face turned red, and he looked down.

He had probably been feeling down and confused after finding out that someone he had believed to be his father and mother for so long weren't actually his biological parents.

I think that was showing on the surface as his health issues.

As evidence, Silver's complexion has considerably improved.

Hmm, but there still seems to be some hesitation.

Maybe I should give him that final push.

"Hey, Silver, did you know?"

"What?"

"Dad and Grandpa and Grandma, we're not biologically related."

"!! No way!!"

Upon hearing my confession, Silver exclaimed in absolute astonishment.

Is he more surprised by the fact that we're not blood-related than reassured?

I had hoped to comfort him, but it seems to have had the opposite effect.

Seeing this, Cecily chuckled and gently stroked Silver's head.

"It's strange, isn't it? But it's the truth."

"Huh? Really? Is it really, really true?"

"Yes. When Dad was a baby, he was the only survivor in a carriage attacked by monsters, and Grandpa Merlin found him and raised him."

"Is that... really true... even though he looks so much like you..."

Huh? Do I really look that much like him?

"So, what about Grandma Ekaterina?"

"Well, that's different too. She's not Grandpa and Grandma's daughter, and I don't even know who my real parents are."

"Is that so..."

Upon hearing this, Silver became disheartened again.

Is it because Ekaterina isn't his real grandma, or is it the shock of not knowing who my parents are?

...Maybe both.

"Both I and Cecily, Grandpa, and Grandma Ekaterina, we've all raised you thinking of you as our own child, our grandchild, our great-grandchild. You understand that, right?"

"...Yeah."

Then there's no problem. Silver is Sylvester Wolfort, my and Cecily's son, Ekaterina's grandson, Merlin's and Merida's great-grandson. He should carry that with pride.

As I firmly stated this, Silver hesitated for a moment, then looked up at us with puppy-dog eyes.

"...Is it okay?"

With his hesitant words, Silver made my heart skip a beat.

"Yeah!"

"Of course!"

Squeak!

Cecily seemed to feel the same way and gave Silver a big hug.

I also embraced both of them together.

After giving birth to two children, my breasts had become even more bountiful, and Silver looked uncomfortable being buried in them. But he could endure it for a little longer.

Even though we're not biologically related, it was a reassurance to know that our hearts and bonds were connected.

As we held each other like this, a voice of discontent arose.

"Sharlmo!"

"Huh?"

Sharl, who had somehow managed to stand on her chair, dived toward us.

"Whoa!"

Being a toddler, she literally jumped without considering the consequences.

I quickly caught Sharl as she flew in, and her cheeks were puffed up.

"Hey, Sharl! That was dangerous!"

"Big brother is so unfair! Sharl wants a hug too!"

Ignoring my warning, Sharl pouted and turned her face away. She must have been jealous since we were all hugging without her.

Sharl's cute and pouty expression as she turned away in apparent anger made me burst into laughter.

"Hey, Sharl."

"..."

Even though she didn't answer, it's fine.

"Sharl, do you like your big brother?"

When I said that, the unhappy expression she had a moment ago vanished, and she gave me a bewildered look before looking at Silver.

Then, she twisted herself out of my grasp and clung to Silver.

"Wow!"

With Silver lying on the bed, he was pushed over when Sharl hugged him. The culprit who pushed Silver down, after nuzzling Silver's chest, grinned and said:

"I love you!"

Silver was momentarily taken aback by Sharl's pure declaration, but he quickly broke into a smile.

"Sharl."

"Yeah?"

"I love you too."

"Hehe."

Being told she was loved by her beloved big brother, Sharl had a happy look on her face.

After confirming Sharl's reaction, Silver turned toward us.

"...Dad."

"Yeah?"

"Mom..."

"What is it?"

After calling us, Silver bowed his head slightly.
