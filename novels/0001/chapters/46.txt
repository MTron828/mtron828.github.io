The time goes back a little, to the time when Shin and Cecily were affectionate in Claude's mansion. The former imperial capital had fallen to Strom, becoming a city of demons and monsters running rampant. It was there that the demons had gathered.

What actions did Strom and the others take after capturing the imperial capital?

First, Strom increased the number of monsters, causing them to flood the former imperial territory, making it impossible for other nations to intervene. After sealing off the movements of various countries, they began to annihilate each town that remained within the former imperial territory.

Strom attacked every caravan leaving the towns, as well as the monster hunters who set out for investigation, sealing off the flow of information and goods between towns. As a result, towns stopped receiving supplies, but nobody knew why.

Even when they attempted to investigate, all the soldiers had been conscripted for Herald's reckless expedition, and the trusted monster hunters sent out for investigation hadn't returned. With no information coming in, the fact that the imperial army had already been wiped out and the imperial capital had fallen to the demons remained unknown.

Gradually, the lack of essential supplies in their daily lives led to increasing dissatisfaction among the residents.

"Hey! Give me all the bread you have here!"

"What are you talking about? Wheat flour isn't coming in right now, and there's a set limit per household!"

"Who cares about that! I have a big family!"

"We're all in the same boat! Everyone's being patient, don't be selfish!"

"What did you say, old lady!"

"What did you say!"

In various parts of the town, such commotions became more frequent, and people were not only physically exhausted due to food shortages but also mentally drained.

Even with such commotions, supplies didn't come in, and when they were almost drained of the will to make noise due to hunger...

"Well, it's demons! A group of demons is heading this way!"

A lookout on the city walls shouted about the demon attack as they rushed over.

"What did you say!?"

"Damn it! What is the imperial army doing!"

"What are we going to do? There are hardly any monster hunters left!"

The panicked residents faced the demon attack.

And at that moment...

"Hello, everyone. How are you today?"

The voice that seemed to mock the exhausted residents due to hunger and lack of information echoed through the city.

"I am Oliver Strom, and I have a proposition for the residents of this city."

The panicked residents of the city, in the midst of a demon attack, heard this sudden voice echoing through the city, causing further confusion.

"Now, is there anyone in this city who bears a strong grudge and anger against the nobles? Those who want to kill the nobles with their own hands, raise your hand. If so... well, how about gathering at the south gate of this city? Let's give you the power to overthrow the nobles. You have one hour from now."

The voice that had been echoing throughout the city suddenly ceased after these words.

The residents who heard this proclamation didn't know what to make of it. None of them had any love for the haughty and oppressive nobles. However, when asked if they truly wanted to kill them, the residents were bewildered and attempted to flee.

"No! We can't open the gates now!"

"Why not? After that strange voice, the demons haven't attacked! We need to escape now!"

"But the demons are out there, flooding the area around the city! There's nowhere to run!"

Such conversations were happening at all the gates except for the south gate.

The demons had arrived in great numbers, but they weren't attacking. Just when the residents thought it was safe, an inexplicable voice resonated, posing incomprehensible questions.

In the meantime, they tried to escape, but the city was already surrounded by demons. Unable to escape, the residents awaited their fate, feeling like prisoners on death row.

At the south gate, a few residents who had responded to Strom's call had gathered.

"Hmm, there are fewer than I expected."

"Strom, is it possible that this method is making the residents suspicious?"

"It doesn't matter. Our goal isn't to gather people. With this, the city's residents will feel even more confusion and despair, won't they?"

"I spoke out of turn. I apologize."

"It's fine."

The red-eyed man who spoke in the same voice as the previous proclamation began gathering dark magic in his hand.

He then pushed the black magic into the chests of those who harbored hatred for the nobles.

"Ugh, aghh!"

"Ah, aah!"

The residents who had black magic pushed into their chests instantly began to suffer.

He continued pushing black magic into everyone present. The residents writhed in agony for a while, but eventually regained their composure and felt that their bodies, their magic, were overflowing.

"This is... amazing."

"Yes, it's incredible. Now, we can do anything..."

Saying so, they turned around, their eyes stained red, transformed into demons.

"Now, one hour has passed. You may proceed to the Lord's Mansion. Make sure to finish them off."

"Yes!"

"Understood."

"Then..."

Strom cast a spell towards the sky, and an explosion of magic occurred overhead. The residents watched in astonishment as the magic exploded like fireworks.

And then...

With a loud explosion, the gates in the east, west, north, and south were shattered by the magic, and demons and monsters poured in.

"Aaaah!"

"Screaaam!"

"Nooo!"

The residents were trampled by the invading demons and monsters.

"Well, what a beautiful sight," Strom observed with a satisfied expression as the city was overrun.

As he continued to watch, the Lord's Mansion in the distance crumbled and fell.

"Hmm, it seems they've done well over there. It was worth sealing off the Lord's Mansion by the magic of the demons to prevent the city's nobles from escaping."

Since Strom had issued proclamations throughout the city, he had demon forces seal off the Lord's Mansion to ensure the nobles couldn't escape. As a result, the nobles who had considered leaving the residents behind were detained in the mansion, and the transformed beings in the city by the demons were allowed to fulfill their purpose.

And then... every remaining resident, regardless of age or social status, was mercilessly exterminated by the demons and monsters.

In this manner, they went on to attack each town one by one, and ultimately, they brought about the annihilation of every town and village.

To be honest, with the kind of forces they had, they could have easily attacked the towns and made them fall without the hassle of blocking information or logistics. However, Strom chose not to do so.

The reason was that he wanted to push not just the nobles but also the commoners into physical and mental despair before capturing the cities.

Strom hated the Empire to such an extent.

In this way, it took a significant amount of time to attack and capture each town one by one, but they finally succeeded in wiping out all the towns and villages.

The demons who had gathered in the former imperial capital had been waiting for this moment with anticipation.

The purge within the Empire was completed. Next, they intended to unify the neighboring countries and, ultimately, conquer the world.

With our power, it's possible. No one can stand in our way.

Those who had gained the power of demons through Strom were using that power to the fullest and were reveling in it.

The demons who had gathered in the audience chamber of the former imperial castle, in a glamorous place they had never been connected to before, were filled with excitement about the future, awaiting Strom's appearance.

"Well, it's finally here!"

"Yes, it took time, but we've completely purged the Empire. There's no one who can challenge us. It's time for the proclamation of world unification."

"That's right! I'm looking forward to it! Hey!"

"Yeah... I'm looking forward to it."

We will unify the world. With our power, we can surely do it.

The oppressed commoners of the Empire, having gained power, had grown more self-confident and started dreaming of things they couldn't have before.

Their newly acquired ambitions would soon be proclaimed.

And so, they waited in anticipation, and finally, Strom, along with Milia and Zest, appeared in the audience chamber.

Strom walked through the ranks of the demons.

In the eyes of the demons who saw him off, there was respect and anticipation.

Then, he took a seat on the throne where the Emperor had once sat.

Finally, the proclamation was about to be made.

The hopes of the demons who had been waiting with anticipation were shattered by Strom's words.

"Well, thanks to all of your efforts, we were able to bring about the fall of the Empire safely. We did it, but..."

"What will be done next, Strom-sama?"

"Well... destroying the Empire was my goal, so now, what should we do?"

The demons couldn't believe their ears.

There was nothing to do after bringing about the fall of the Empire? What was he saying? These were not the words they wanted to hear.

"Why... why did you turn us into demons, then?"

"Huh? It should be obvious, right? You're pawns."

"Pawns... are we just pawns to you!?"

The man who had been speaking earlier shouted at Strom's words.

"I became a demon because I thought I could unify the world with you!"

"Huh? Didn't I say it? If anyone had a grudge against the nobles, if anyone wanted to take revenge on the nobles. Why is the conversation turning this way?"

It was true that Strom had turned those who held strong grudges against the nobles into demons. He had done it under the assumption that they wanted to take revenge on the nobles.

So why was this happening? Strom was genuinely puzzled, tilting his head.

"You...!"

The man who had shouted earlier finally lost his temper and began gathering his magical power.

However, Strom merely waved his hand in annoyance, and the gathered magical power dissipated, leaving the man's face in astonishment.

The witnessing demons had mixed feelings.

Some were impressed, thinking that Strom was indeed amazing.

Others felt frustration towards Strom, wondering why he wouldn't unify the world with such power.

A sense of unease began to spread among the demons.

Upon seeing this, Strom uttered in a genuinely exasperated tone, "You are free to have your own ambitions, but please don't impose them on me."

Without reprimanding the man who was attempting to rebel, Strom made it clear that he didn't want his ideas forced upon him.

In response, the man, wearing an expression filled with disappointment and anger, glared at Strom.

"So... you don't have any intention of unifying the world, no matter what?"

"That's exactly what I'm saying."

In response to Strom's answer, the man who had been in rebellion finally spoke words of parting.

"I see, is that so? Understood! I'll stop expecting anything from you then! In that case, I'll do things my way!"

"Go ahead. In fact, you should have done that from the beginning."

"Ugh... Excuse me!"

With these words, the man turned on his heel and left the audience chamber.

The excitement that had been present just moments ago had now cooled, and an uneasy atmosphere filled the audience chamber.

Why had things turned out this way?

Weren't they just dreaming of a bright future moments ago?

Now, all they felt was disappointment and confusion.

This feeling was especially strong among the demons who had been dreaming of world unification.

"If anyone else agrees with his ideas, feel free to follow him. You don't need to hold back. Go wherever you want."

If they wanted to go, they could go anywhere. With these words, Strom made it seem as if they had no value and were merely pawns. Those who had initially expected Strom to embark on world unification with them expressed their anger and followed the man who had left the room.

Their numbers amounted to about a hundred, which was roughly two-thirds of the entire group.

In the end, only about fifty people remained in the audience chamber, those who had been present during the initial fall of the capital.

"Ah... what could they be thinking..."

"Probably... they suddenly gained incredible power, so they're intoxicated by it."

"I see..."

"Those who remain here were originally members of the military or had combat experience as demon hunters. Those who left earlier were mostly individuals who had never experienced combat."

"Well, you're observant."

"They're the ones who will become Strom-sama's pawns, so it's only natural to assess their combat capabilities."

However, Strom didn't appear to be so enthusiastic about the situation.

"Strom-sama, rather than rushing to a conclusion, wouldn't it be a good idea to take a break for a while? During that time, I can continue investigating this Shin-Walford," Zest, a former member of the intelligence division, suggested that Strom take some time off while they continued to gather information about Shin.

"You don't need to prepare so thoroughly, but..."

"However, you made such thorough preparations to bring about the downfall of the empire, didn't you?"

"I wanted to bring down the empire at all costs."

Milia, curious about something she had been wondering about for a while, decided to ask Strom a question.

"Um... Strom-sama, why do you hate the empire so much? I heard that you used to be a noble of the empire..."

Milia inquired about something that had been on her mind. She wanted to understand why Strom harbored such hatred for the empire.

It was clear that many people resented the nobility, but Strom's hatred extended even to the commoners. Milia also wanted to know why Strom became a demon in the first place, a question she had never asked before.

"Come to think of it, we've never discussed this," Milia mentioned.

With that prompt, Strom began to explain what had happened in his past.

"You see... I was originally a duke with a claim to the imperial throne." a fun fact
