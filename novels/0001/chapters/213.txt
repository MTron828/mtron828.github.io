A few days have passed since Hao transformed into a demon and attacked the Youkou Palace.

We decided to spend our time leisurely at the Min family's place until we receive contact from the Quanrong government.

We were initially cautious, thinking that there might still be remnants of followers of Hao, but not only did no one attack the Min family, there wasn't even anyone monitoring us.

At the Min family, Suiren, who had recovered, was summoned to the Youkou Palace several times, and her opinions were sought regarding dragon hunting and the repeal of the Dragonhide Trading Prohibition Act.

I was informed about the situation at that time, and everyone seemed to be actively working towards the repeal of the legislation. Moreover, there was even a proposal to use Hao's confiscated wealth to compensate former dragonhide traders who were forced out of business by the legislation.

It was expected to pass without any issues.

Hao must have been really disliked by everyone.

It almost felt like they were trying to erase all traces of Hao.

Well, considering he was plotting the emperor's assassination in the end, it's not surprising.

In the future, Hao's name will likely be remembered as a great criminal throughout the realm.

Truly an example of reaping what you sow.

With Suiren's story and our improved situation, we finally felt at ease, and we were able to explore Eilon for the first time.

"This way, please."

On this day, Suiren was guiding me, Sissily, Silver, and our interpreter Shaolin as we explored the imperial capital.

"They even sell children's clothing over here."

"Kwanlong clothes are rare in the Western world, so I'm looking forward to it."

"Hehe, that's right."

"Huh?"

So, we were heading towards a clothing store.

It all started when Suiren, who had a soft spot for Silver, suggested that she would like to see Silver wearing Kwanlong clothing.

Kwanlong clothing has a slightly different style but is somewhat Chinese in fashion.

Silver wearing children's clothing like that... It would be absolutely adorable!

Both Sissily and I readily agreed to Suiren's suggestion.

"Hehe, I'm sure it will suit Silver-kun."

"Yay!"

While leading us, Suiren occasionally showered Silver with attention.

"He really loves children, doesn't he?"

Silver seems to sense that too, as he's much more attached to Suiren than Shaolin.

"But still, it feels like a different person is taking care of Silver."

Shaolin watches Suiren dote on Silver with a complex expression.

"Is that so? We only know Suiren like that, you know."

"She's a completely different person during work, isn't she? She's always on edge and very strict. Being around her while she's working makes many people feel nervous."

"Is she really that scary?"

"Not scary, per se... but she's strict. However, she never says anything wrong, and she's excellent at her job, so no one can complain."

"Oh, I see. She did mention being the head of the company as a woman. Is it rare for a woman to hold such a position?"

"Yes, it is. There are a few, but it's a very small number. She lives in a world where she can't show any weaknesses, I think."

I see. I've been around many strong women, but maybe in Kwanlong, women's advancement in society is still viewed critically.

"That's why... I feel like she strongly desires to become a mother in her personal life."

I see. It might be to maintain a balance in her life.

"However... I thought she would be strict if she had children, but seeing this, she might become overly affectionate and indulgent..."

Haha...

I can't say anything about that.

"We've arrived; here it is."

While we were walking and having this conversation, we had somehow reached our destination.

This shop, being frequented by high-ranking company executives, naturally had a luxurious ambiance.

"Um... Is this place expensive?"

We mentioned that we were exploring Eilon, and since the exchange rate wasn't confirmed yet, we didn't have Kwanlong currency with us.

This shopping trip was Suiren's request, so everything would be on her account.

As someone receiving this generosity, I felt hesitant about spending too much on high-end items...

"Don't worry; it's not a problem at all. Lord Shin and Lady Tennen-sama have created an opportunity to repeal that wicked law. The benefits we'll gain from that are immeasurable. So compared to that, this expenditure is nothing. Lord Shin and Lady Tennen-sama, if you find clothes you like, please purchase them."

"I see. In that case, I'll take you up on your offer."

"Sorry, Suiren-san. Thank you."

"Aww."

Nevertheless, with a sense of gratitude, Sissily and I both bowed to Suiren. Seeing this, Silver also joined in bowing.

It was an incredibly cute sight that not only touched our hearts but seemed to have an impact on Suiren as well.

"Kawaii!!"

"Nyafu?"

Silver, who was initially surprised when Suiren suddenly stroked his head, soon realized she was praising him and started giggling happily.

"Now, Silver-kun, I'll help you pick out clothes that suit you! Lady Tennen-sama, please come with me!"

"Uh, um! Please stop using that title in public!"

Sissily quickly followed Suiren, who was walking ahead in a hurry.

"Wait, did Suiren just call Sissily 'Lady Tennen-sama' now?"

"Yes, she did. So Sissily-dono asked her to stop using that title."

"Shaolin-san, you're not translating that, are you?"

I said, and Shaolin smiled wryly.

"Even if Sissily-dono asks her to stop, my sister won't stop calling her Lady Tennen-sama. She probably just learned that word."

"I see."

"Then, I'll go to where the two of them are. What will you do, Lord Shin?"

"I'll take a look around the store randomly. It's a clothing store, so it shouldn't be a problem even if I can't communicate with words."

"I see. In that case, I'll excuse myself."

Saying so, Shaolin went towards Sissily and Suiren.

"Now then, I guess I'll wander around here."

I immediately began to browse the clothing store in Kwanlong I had come to for the first time.

This store seemed to sell not only clothes but also accessories.

As I looked around the store, my impression was that it evoked a sense of ancient China. The clothing, as well as the accessories, had a different style than Aelrside's.

Such designs have never been seen before, so they could sell well in the Western world, including Aelrside.

Conversely, Western world accessories might also be unfamiliar in this world, so they could sell here.

In fact, even now, the shop assistants are sneakily looking at me and Sissily.

It seems like they're not just looking at unfamiliar customers but also at our clothes.

Their gazes don't carry any suspicion.

Could this be a profitable trade opportunity for Kwanlong? In the Western world, multiple countries compete to trade with Kwanlong, but in the Eastern world, Kwanlong stands alone.

Unlike the Western world, where profits would be divided among multiple nations, in the Eastern world, all the profits would accumulate in Kwanlong.

Particularly, dragonhide is sure to sell well.

The dragonhide jacket in front of me looks incredibly cool.

While the Western world has clothes made from cow or sheep leather, those made from dragonhide are different even in terms of touch.

It's quite tough.

Almost like leather armor.

But it seems they've processed the joints well to ensure they don't hinder movement, so it didn't feel uncomfortable to wear.

"This is cool... I wonder how much it costs?"

Thinking that, I check the price tag.

The numbers seem to use characters familiar in the Eastern world, and I could read them, but because they're written in Kwanlong's currency value, I don't know how much it would cost in the Western world.

Well, it's definitely a luxury item.

I can't possibly ask for something so expensive.

I give up and move away from the dragonhide products shelf.

As I continue to browse the store, I arrive at a section selling clothes.

This is... I begin to carefully examine the clothes on display in that section.

And then, it happened when I found the clothing I thought was perfect.

"Shin-kun!"

Silver is not in her arms.

"What's wrong... oh..."

I approach, thinking they've likely finished selecting clothes. At Sissily's feet is Silver, dressed in what looks like martial arts attire.

"So cute, right?"

"Yeah... incredibly cute..."

The loose-fitting clothes suit Silver's wobbly walk perfectly.

I knelt in front of Silver, who had a slightly perplexed expression, probably because of the unfamiliar clothes. I extended both of my palms toward Silver.

"Here, Silver. Give me a high-five."

"Huh? Hi-yah! High-five!"

Initially, Silver tilted his head in confusion, but he quickly grasped my intention and delivered a punch to my upturned palm.

"So cute!!"

Silver, dressed in a children's martial arts outfit and throwing punches, had the ladies captivated.

Of course, no one can compete with Silver's cuteness.

"This one's perfect! Next!"

"Huh? You mean you're buying more?"

"Of course! To see such an adorable Silver-kun... this is a reward for myself!"

Suiren said this and promptly went to find the next set of clothes.

"Ha... She was bedridden with illness not long ago, but she's so energetic now."

She took Sissily away again, leaving Shaolin and me alone.

"Haha... It's true. I was recovering from an illness, but thanks to that, I feel completely refreshed at work. Since the illness is fully cured now, I have a surplus of energy."

"I see."

"By the way, Lord Shin, is there anything that caught your interest?"

"Yeah... actually..."

In response to Shaolin's question, I mentioned the clothes I had my eye on earlier. I didn't mention the dragonhide jacket, which would undoubtedly be a luxury item. I knew I couldn't ask her to buy something that expensive. I decided I'd buy it myself once the exchange rate with Kwanlong was confirmed.

That's what I had in mind.

By the way, the clothes I mentioned were indeed purchased for me. She said she could even buy more expensive ones, but I thought the one I pointed out was already quite luxurious. When I touched it, I believed it was made of silk. Seeing her buy it so casually made me realize that Shaolin must be a young lady from a noble family.

After Suiren continued selecting clothes for Silver, and Silver got tired, the shopping spree came to an end when the cart provided by the store was filled to the brim with our purchases.

"Sorry, Suiren-san. We have so many items..."

Sissily looked at the cart overflowing with packages, and she apologized with a sheepish expression.

"Don't worry about it. Like I mentioned before, this is like a reward for me too."

"I see. Thank you."

"Hehe, by the way, Silver-kun sleeping in your arms is adorable too."

"Nyuu..."

As Suiren smiled and stroked Silver's head, Silver, who was already asleep in my arms, mumbled something in his sleep.

By the way, Silver is wearing the martial arts outfit we bought earlier. The store asked if he could wear it home, as it would serve as advertising for the shop. Of course, I immediately agreed because it's so cute.

"Sigh... I also want a child soon."

"Well, now that your health has improved, you can have one anytime."

"Yes, you're right... Thank you very much. Lady of the Skies and Lord Shin, you are our benefactors. Please don't hesitate to rely on us for anything in the future."

"Yes, thank you."

As we chatted, we began our journey back. By the way, the reason we didn't use the pocket dimension for our shopping bags is also because the store requested it. The bags containing the clothes are labeled with the store's name. Showing off those bags in large quantities, along with Silver wearing the shop's clothes, would be excellent advertising, they said. We agreed to this request because they offered a discount if we did. If it would lighten Suiren and the others' load even a little, it was worth it. And so, we strolled through the city once more and returned to the Min residence.

"Phew, I'm a bit tired."

I had been carrying Silver, who had been asleep the whole time. While it wasn't physically taxing, I had to be careful not to wake him, which made it mentally tiring.

"Thank you, Shin-kun. I'll take care of Silver."

Sissily said that and took Silver from me, laying him on the living room sofa.

We could have taken him to a room and laid him on a futon, but he tends to cry if he wakes up and no one's around.

After laying Silver down, the two of us sighed in relief as we sat on the sofa. The timing was exactly the same, and we couldn't help but exchange glances and burst into laughter.

"It was a tough day, but it was fun."

"Yeah, you're right. By the way, did you get to see Silver in all the outfits we bought?"

"Yes, they all looked adorable. Shin, I'm sure you'll like them too."

"I see, looking forward to it then."

The two of us spent some peaceful time like that. After enjoying the moment, Sissily suddenly asked a question.

"By the way, Shin, did you buy anything for yourself?"

Oh, that's right.

"Well, actually, I didn't buy anything for myself. I bought something for Sissily instead."

"Me? Really?"

"Yeah, let me get it... Ah, here it is."

I took out a bag from my inventory that contained Sissily's clothes.

"Can I take a look?"

"Of course."

I said, and Sissily took the clothes out of the bag.

"Oh, it's a beautiful shade of blue..."

"I thought blue would suit you."

"The fabric feels really nice."

"It's probably a high-quality item. To buy it without hesitation, the Min family must be wealthy."

"Yes, they are. Um, can I try it on?"

"Of course!"

"Alright, I'll change into it."

Sissily said and happily headed to the room she had been assigned.

We waited for her for a while, but she didn't return. I glanced at the entrance of the living room, wondering what was taking her so long, and there I found Sissily. She had a bright red face and was peeking out with only her face showing.

"What are you doing?"

I asked, and Sissily, looking embarrassed, fidgeted as she spoke.

"Um, well... Is this okay?"

She said that and showed not just her face but her entire body.

"Wow..."

There stood Sissily in a Chinese-style dress with a shade of blue.

"How do I look?"

"It's amazing... You really look good in it. You're beautiful."

"Uh... Th-thank you. But, um..."

"Hmm?"

When I complimented her, Sissily responded with a bashful but pleased expression. However, she still seemed embarrassed.

"But, I have to say, this dress... why is the slit so high...?"

Sissily had been concerned about the area around her thighs, so I looked to see what she was talking about. There, I noticed that the dress had a deep slit running up to the upper part of her leg.

"Oh..."

I had assumed that the slit on a Chinese-style dress would only go up to around the knees! I couldn't believe it went so high.

"Uh, I'm embarrassed..."

Sissily said, fidgeting.

"..."

I looked at Sissily's outfit again. The dress accentuated her body's lines beautifully, and the unexpectedly deep slit added a touch of sensuality.

Observing her closely, I took Sissily's hand.

"Huh? Uh, Shin?"

Later, when Silver woke up and found that we weren't around, his cries echoed throughout the mansion.trip
