With the students who had followed this operation, we left the battlefield.

Prior to the students returning on foot, we decided to return to the Arlesheid Royal Castle through the gate.

The students informed us that some of the Arlesheid Army would accompany us, and we were told to return first and report to Uncle Dis.

Soldiers welcomed us at the usual guard station at the gate.

From those soldiers, we were praised for defeating the demon, but at the same time, we were informed that the public was excited about the story of the old man and old lady.

The fact that the demon had approached Arlesheid and that the old man and old lady had defeated it was known to the world.

"...Isn't this bad?"

"Yeah... It seems like the public has found out that we let the demon escape. What do we do? Are we going to be blamed?"

Alice's concerns were valid.

We had gone to the trouble of defeating the demon, but to be blamed...

We were the ones who had failed.

For now, let's go report to Uncle Dis in the castle.

I have a feeling he's going to scold us there...

With everyone feeling gloomy, we followed the soldier who was leading the way.

We had already contacted them before returning to Arlesheid, so we were led straight to the audience chamber.

We hadn't even changed, we were still in our combat uniforms... Is that okay?

Such doubts crossed my mind, but we had already arrived at the audience chamber.

And when the large doors opened...

We were greeted by loud applause.

"Welcome back. Heroes who saved the world!"

Uncle Dis was already on the throne, and he stood up to welcome us and gestured for us to come closer.

Following his voice, we approached the throne.

During this time, the applause never ceased.

(What's going on?)

(I don't know. Could it be that our failure to capture the demon is not being seen as a problem?)

We had gone to the audience chamber expecting to be scolded, but we were unexpectedly welcomed.

While speaking softly with Aug, slightly bewildered, it seemed like this time's situation was not being particularly scrutinized.

Damn, Grandma. She's saying such threatening things.

I can't say it out loud, so I scream it in my mind.

And as we approached the throne and knelt, we received words from Uncle Dis.

"August, Shin-Wolford, and the others did well. It's an unparalleled achievement to have annihilated the demons who attempted the assault. I praise you."

"Yes. Thank you very much. However, we made a mistake in the final stages. As a result, we put everyone in danger. We don't really deserve the praise."

Uncle Dis praised us, but Aug and I still thought we didn't deserve it due to the repeated mistakes in the final judgment. I felt the same way.

On my battlefield debut, all I could see were points for reflection. I was quite disheartened.

"Don't worry about it. The demons you failed to capture were eliminated by Lord Sages and Lady Priestess. It's a result that pleases the people, who think the heroes of the past are still heroes. No one will blame you."

Huh? Is no one angry?

Thinking that, when I looked around, everyone had smiles, and there was no one giving us accusatory looks.

Maybe because it was Grandpa who had dealt the final blow to the demon, everyone's attention was focused on that, and our failure didn't stand out as much?

I was relieved that we weren't blamed, but I didn't think we were forgiven.

The fact that we had failed was still a reality, and this was just a result that we could accept.

Even if we weren't blamed for this, I couldn't forget it.

There's still a lot I need to learn...

"So, as a reward, there are no more medals. I'd like you to wait a little longer..."

"Your Majesty, we participated in the military action this time. If you're going to give rewards, please make them equal for everyone. We don't want to be treated specially."

Aug rejected Uncle Dis's offer.

Honestly, we only went on this business trip for the final demon battle.

So, if they mentioned medals or rewards, we would be in trouble.

The real heroes are the members of the army who are still battling demons in the demon territory.

With those words, the report to Uncle Dis was concluded.

Leaving the audience chamber, we gathered in Aug's room and discussed whether Uncle Dis's words, that no one was blaming us, were true.

"Father would have no reason to lie in that situation. We were praised by the civil officials, military officials, and nobles who were present. I think it's safe to assume that the common people are the same, right?"

"But Uncle Dis might have just said that to reassure us."

"That's not the case."

Aug said it firmly.

"Moreover, those who know the details are the people who were present in the audience chamber just now. Even so, they praised us, so it should be fine."

I see. The people at the top of the country probably know the detailed story.

Even so, if the common people knew, perhaps there were rumors circulating that were slightly different from the truth.

Even so, I couldn't fully trust it without seeing it with my own eyes, so I decided to go to the town alone and check the situation.

I'm the only one who can use optical camouflage without a cloak, and if we all go, we'll definitely get separated.

We won't be able to see each other either.

When I went to the town, the townspeople were buzzing with stories about Grandpa and Grandma's battle with the demon and our annihilation of the demon group.

Banners with "Ultimate Magicians' Demon Annihilation Commemorative Sale" were hanging here and there in the shops, and the Walford Trading Company was flourishing as the shop I owned.

Especially the Exchange Swords and Jet Boots were selling like hotcakes.

Thanks to the communication device, the progress of the daily operations was being reported in Arlesheid.

It's a good thing that the Jet Boots are becoming popular, unlike the Exchange Swords.

After this incident is completely over, maybe I can provide entertainment for everyone.

And I went to my house to check on it...

I couldn't get close to my house.

The streets in front of the house were completely packed with people, and it was completely blocked off.

What a neighborhood nuisance.

The security team had arrived, and traffic control was in progress.

To prevent any further people from entering, I stopped in front of the gate, and access was restricted.

From a distance, I could see the security personnel, including Alex, desperately managing the situation at the gate.

I'm sorry, but hang in there!

After that, I wandered through the town and visited Mark and Olivia's family shop, but I didn't hear a single word of blame directed at us.

On the contrary, all I could hear were words of praise for our demon extermination.

To briefly explain the story circulating among the people:

It was said that we didn't let the demon escape, but that Grandpa and the others detected and defeated the demons who had sensed the attack and fled. Everyone accepted this because it was the Wise Lord who detected the approaching demons.

I don't know the exact reason, but it wouldn't be surprising if the Wise Lord had the power to detect approaching demons.

That's how it seemed. The hero worship has gone overboard, and they believe that Grandpa and the others are capable of anything.

In reality, there were those who acted ahead of us. We failed to notice it and let the demon escape. Our subsequent mistakes in tracking them were not communicated at all.

It seems like they intentionally explained it in such a way to remove the people's anxieties rather than instill them.

This way, the people are gradually being told stories that are not lies but not entirely true either.

The final outcome is the same, but the impressions are completely different because of the different circumstances along the way.

Is this information manipulation...?

After finishing my information gathering in the town, I opened the gate in a deserted alley and returned to Aug's room.

"Oh! Welcome back, Shin Onii-chan!"

There, Mei-chan was waiting and gave me a full-hearted, enthusiastic welcome.

"Gef! Long time... Mei-chan."

"Yes!"

Mei-chan greeted me with a beaming smile.

As her older brother, I couldn't kneel down here, even if Mei-chan had improved her magic skills and body enhancement tackles!

"It's been a while, Shin-san."

"Oh, yeah. It's been a while, Ellie."

Aug's fiancée, Ellie, was also there, holding Mei-chan and returning the greeting with her knees shaking.

"How was it? Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm okay, but it's not okay..."

"What do you mean?"

In response to Aug's question, I recounted what I had seen in the city.

As I did, everyone's faces gradually grew disheartened.

"Is it... causing that much of a commotion?"

"I mean, you can't even walk around the city anymore!"

Maria and Alice's words summed it up.

It had already become difficult to go out, but this incident made it even worse.

It's not the concern we had, but it might no longer be easy to go out.

"Information manipulation is scary... I was prepared to be berated, but instead, we're being celebrated as heroes."

"How about... our shop? How was our shop?"

"The Brick Oven? There was a long line. And everyone was disappointed that Olivia wasn't there, so they left the shop. I mean, I just got back, so I can't be in the shop right away. The customers who left the shop are probably regretting it. The ones waiting in line don't know that, so more and more disappointed customers are showing up..."

"Does that mean... I have to be at the shop?"

"Yeah... because everyone knows that Olivia is the daughter of that shop and works as a waitress..."

Publicly, Olivia is the only one whose whereabouts are known.

That's why everyone gathered there.

The nearby Bean Workshop was busier than usual, but it wasn't anything significant.

"Olivia... do your best!"

"Ufufu, do your best, Olivia."

"Alice-san, Yuri-san, don't think of it as someone else's problem!"

This is because, even if it's just for a short time, Olivia might need to work in the shop to prevent the customers from causing a commotion.

But if the confusion gets worse, we may need to announce that she won't be coming to the shop anymore.

"I'm glad I remembered the gate. I never thought it would cause such a commotion."

"In that case... I'll be the only one who stands out..."

"What do you mean, Ellie?"

Ellie let out a sigh with a worried expression.

Only Ellie stands out?

"It's the wedding. The demon commotion has ended, so we'll proceed with it, right?"

That's true, and we've even personally greeted Pope Ekaterina, so I don't see any problems...

"But you see, among the bride and groom, I'm the only one who's not an Ultimate Magician."

"Oh, is that it?"

"That's not it! Everyone is the country's... no, the world's heroes. Yet here I am..."

Huh? She was worried about that?

Well, I don't think people expect those heroic qualities from someone who's going to be the crown princess...

"Ellie-san, you're worrying too much. You're going to be the prince's bride, something everyone envies. That's special enough, isn't it?"

"I-Is that so?"

With Sicily's persuasion, Ellie's concerns are starting to fade away.

Just like with me, when Sicily advises me, I tend to agree.

"Yes, that's right. So let's confidently have the ceremony together."

"Sicily-san... Yes, I understand. Thank you."

Ah, she was convinced.

But when you think about it, she's going to be the crown princess.

In the future, she'll be the queen.

Even now, as the daughter of a duke, it's unthinkable for someone like her not to be special.

Depending on the era, there might even be a royal wedding fever.

What was she so worried about?

The two of them continued to talk about their expectations for the dress, the ceremony performed by His Holiness the Pope, and other preparations for the wedding.

"Good grief, I never expected her to have such concerns."

"I was surprised too. In a normal position, you wouldn't think about such things."

"We're too unique..."

"I kind of get it."

When I first came to this country, I never dreamed that something like this would happen.

I grew up in the mountains, and I came to the capital to learn common sense and make friends.

I made a lot of friends and even got a girlfriend...

"I never dreamed that we'd be celebrated as heroes."

"Really? Being the grandson of heroes, I thought that if I achieved something, I would be seen as a hero right away."

"I didn't know that my grandpa and the others were seen as heroes to that extent."

"Is that so?"

"Well, anyway, I've achieved almost everything I wanted when I came to the capital. I made friends, got a girlfriend, and learned quite a bit of common sense."

"Huh?"

"Huh?"

Huh? Wait... what?

"Lord Shin, you don't seriously think that wearing that outfit gave you common sense, do you?"

"Huh? Huh?"

Toll said it with exasperation.

Huh?

"Have you, Lord Shin, learned some common sense now, after creating such an unusual magical device, significantly enhancing the abilities of the previously stagnant mages and knights, solving the mystery of magic stones, and contributing to the overall improvement of the world's power? Please, don't joke."

"I agree. I was surprised more than ever. Don't surprise us too much, Shin."

"Unbelievable!"

What the heck! I'm still seen as lacking common sense. I've been trying to behave lately...

"Shin, more importantly, you're not planning to create something else, are you?"

"Hm? Well..."

"Is there something...?"

It's a shame that the recent commotion has prevented me from working on it properly.

"It might take quite a while until the wedding can happen, right? Until then, I'm thinking of using the time to develop magical devices."

"Please, just refrain from going overboard. Don't destroy the country's economy."

"Rude! I'm considering that, so I haven't created anything immediately."

"So, if you can solve that problem, you'll start the development, right?"

"Yeah."

"Yeah, it's not like that! You really haven't gained any common sense!"

Is that really the case?

But, I'd like to create magical devices that could make everyone's lives more convenient. When I see Grandma, who is respected and admired by everyone, it motivates me even more.

More importantly, the reason the wedding will take place later is because the head of state is performing the ceremony, which is the current Pope Ekaterina. The operation is still ongoing, not yet completed. We're currently conducting a demon extermination operation, and once we establish a position near the Imperial Capital, we'll announce the end of the operation. The wedding can't take place during ongoing military operations with the head of state as the officiator. I wonder when it will happen. Will the operation be over by the time we advance to the next grade?

While thinking about the future, I was reminded of something, as if I remembered it, and I was addressed by Aug.

"By the way, it's almost the end of the year."

"True."

"Isn't it about time?"

"For what?"

"Your birthday, Shin."

"Huh? Oh."

Come to think of it, I completely forgot about it because I've been preoccupied with the demon realm conquest operation since the end of the summer vacation. The autumn is almost over now, and it's the right time, I guess.

"Speaking of which, what are everyone else's birthdays?"

I had completely forgotten, but apart from Aug's birthday, which is also the Crown Prince's, I don't know the birthdays of the others.

"I have mine at the end of the year."

"Mine too. Maria and I have birthdays close to each other."

Maria and Sissi's birthdays are coming up soon.

"I'm done! It's in early spring."

"Me too. I'm a spring baby."

Alice and Lynn, surprisingly, are older.

"Huh? Really?"

"Haha! I'm the older sister here!"

"We should listen to our older sister."

Even though it's just a few months' difference...

"I'm done as well. During the summer vacation."

"I'm also done. I finished before the summer vacation."

Thor and Julius are also finished.

"Mine is in the New Year."

"Mine too."

"Oh, mine too!"

"I'm almost there."

Tony, Yuri, and Olivia have their birthdays in the New Year, and Mark's is coming up soon.

"I had mine in the spring."

"Mine was right after the summer vacation."

Mei's birthday is in the spring, and Ellie's is shortly after the summer vacation.

"Come to think of it, we haven't really celebrated birthdays at all."

I hadn't been informed.

"This year was special. With the appearance of demons, wars breaking out, demon groups attacking, most people refrained from celebrating loudly or hosting events. Even the nobles did that."

I see. It's because of the times.

Huh? But we had a big engagement party for me, right?

"By the way, Shin, when is your birthday?"

"Huh? Oh, it's on the 20th of the end of the year... I guess."

"What?! The 20th?"

"Really? Shin?"

Sissi and Maria are extremely surprised.

"Well... it's the same as Sissi's birthday."

"Huh? Seriously?"

"Yes, it's true."

Really? I'm surprised! Ah... but...

"I don't know my actual birthday. I was just found by my grandfather on the 20th of the end of the year..."

"Oh... I see..."

"But, still! To be saved by your grandfather on such a day, it's amazing after all! It's destiny!"

Sissi seems determined to feel a sense of destiny.

But it's true, isn't it? The fact that I was saved by Grandpa on Sissi's birthday makes it feel like something destined. I was about one year old at the time, so they probably decided to make it my birthday.

"That's settled then."

"What do you mean?"

"How about celebrating Shin's birthday this year with a big joint party for Shin, Claude, and Messina?"

"Your Highness, that's a great idea!"

"Let's definitely do that! I'm looking forward to it!"

Maria and Sissi seem to be in favor. But why did they suddenly suggest celebrating birthdays?

"As I mentioned earlier, we've refrained from hosting extravagant parties so far. We're in a time of war."

"I get that, but we had a pretty grand engagement party, didn't we?"

"But you became a hero who defeated demons. By celebrating your joyous events in grand style, you aimed to dispel the people's anxieties. While engagements and weddings are being held, other debuts and parties, except yours, haven't been celebrated."

"Oh, really?"

I learned that for the first time.

"So, it's been a while since Shin's engagement party. We'll celebrate Shin and the others' birthdays in style."

"Wow!"

"Wait a minute. What about Mark? He mentioned that his birthday is coming up."

"Please, stop it, Mr. Waldford. I'm content just being with the Ultimate Magicians. We'll celebrate with family in a cozy way, so please forgive me."

Mark firmly refused with tears in his eyes.

Is he really against it?

"You can't have some private time with Olivia, can you?"

"What's with you, Mark? Is that it?"

"Huh? Oh, no..."

Is that it?

"Surprisingly, you're quite lecherous, Mark."

"No, that's not it! I mean, if it's hosted by the Ultimate Magicians, some unexpected people might show up..."

Unexpected people? Ah, you mean Dis-Old Man and the like.

I guess we should refrain from that.

"What about the venue? Is Shin's house okay?"

"Why not? Most likely, Dis-Old Man and others will come, right? Our servants are used to it, so I think that's the best option."

"Great. Then let's head to Shin's house. We need to make the preparations."

Og is enthusiastically taking the lead in organizing our birthday celebration. His spirited demeanor, not usually on display, seemed like an attempt to shake something off. He's quite concerned about losing his composure at the end of the operation and making repeated misjudgments. Knowing Og, he won't forget or fail to reflect on it.

Having swallowed that, he's probably forcing himself not to get depressed and is trying to act cheerfully. I couldn't help but look at Og with warm eyes, understanding his feelings.

"Oh, my! Shin is gazing at Lord Augustus so lovingly!? Just in the moment when you take your eyes off!"

"Elli, please stop your fantasies!"

How long are you going to keep this up?

"Just kidding. I already know about that much."

"Then please stop... My mental state gets worn down every time you bring that up."

"Oh, how disappointing. I was thinking of teasing you a bit more."

"No need to imitate Og! What's with that attitude like 'I respect my husband's actions'?"

"As a wife-to-be, it's only natural."

"Huh? That's impossible for me... It would be way too abnormal."

"What are you so worried about, Sissi!"

Sissi is joining in as well!

"Ha, heh, hehehe. Ahahaha!"

While dealing with Elli and Sissi, Og, who had been listening, burst into laughter.

No, instead of laughing, reprimand Elli!

"That's a relief... He's finally laughing like normal."

"Huh?"

Elli muttered quietly, so only Sissi and I could hear.

"Augustus-sama, who returned from the operation, was pretending to be calm until just now. I knew he was forcing himself, and it was painful to watch..."

I see. Sissi would surely notice, being my childhood friend and fiancée.

"But he's finally laughing like normal. I'm relieved."

Elli's face as she said that was genuinely pleased, probably because she had been genuinely worried about Og, and she seemed to have recovered upon seeing him smile normally.

"I feel like I've laughed for the first time in a while. Elli, I permit you. Keep teasing Shin."

"I haven't heard of such permission before!"

What's with this permission to tease me?

"Yes, I understand!"

"You haven't agreed to it either, Elli!"

I've had enough of this couple! fun activities
for a family of 4 to do indoors on a rainy day
