"Memories of living in a different world...?"

Og muttered in disbelief.

"Wait, wait, wait! What does that even mean? Is it different from the previous civilization?"

It's more like I don't understand the meaning, rather than not believing it.

Everyone seemed to have the same puzzled expression.

Among them, there was someone who understood it faster than anyone else.

"Shin! Is that... I mean, is it about another world?"

Tony, who loved urban legends, asked.

In those kinds of magazines, there are often suspicious features like "Visitors from Another World" or "Gate to Another World."

Among urban legend enthusiasts, another world is a quite popular topic.

Actually, I have memories of living in another world, so I can't help but read those kinds of articles.

Maybe there are other reincarnated people besides me.

But well... most of those articles are made up.

They don't contain detailed information about another world, and they always conclude with phrases like "might be" or "seems to be."

"So, what about it? What was the other world where Shin was?"

"Tony, don't you doubt it?"

To be honest, if it's said that Shin came from another world, I strangely understand!

When Tony said that, everyone seemed to understand as well.

"Huh? Is that it?"

"What do you mean by 'that's it'?"

It seemed like my words weren't clear, and Maria asked.

"Well, I've always thought that everyone would look down on me if I told them that I have memories from my past life..."

I explained the reason why I hadn't revealed that I had memories from my previous life until now, and Maria looked exasperated.

Honestly, Shin is already in a different category.

"A different category? What kind?"

"Human."

"..."

Huh?! They didn't think I was a human!?

"That's why, when you say you have memories from another world, I thought, 'Oh, I see,' and it made sense."

"Right. Honestly, I've always wondered what's going on in Lord Shin's head, but if you have memories from another world, I can understand various things."

"That's right."

"Do you all just accept it!?"

Thor and Julius had, for some reason, refreshed expressions on their faces.

It's like the feeling when a fishbone stuck in your throat finally comes out.

"So, were you all that suspicious...?"

"Hey, hey! Does that mean the design of the clothes we're wearing is from memories of another world?"

The clothes that Alice and the others were wearing are the outfits of the Cutey Three.

"Well, that's right."

"I understand that too. It's too innovative."

Like Alice, Lynn, who was wearing the same clothes, had a satisfied look.

"So, does that mean the magical tools developed by Wolfort-kun are actually magical tools from your past life!?"

"Tell us more!"

Mark and Yuri were focusing on a different aspect.

...When did you two become so interested in magical tools?

I need to make a correction here.

"There were no magical tools."

"Huh?"

My words made Mark and Yuri tilt their heads.

"In the world I remember, there was no magic."

"What!?"

Everyone had expressions of not understanding that explanation.

"Wait a minute. Your world you remember... let's just call it your past life. If there was no magic there, why would you come up with such magical tools?"

"Oh, in my previous world, there was no magic. Instead, science was highly developed."

"Science?"

"Yeah, in this world too, things have natural phenomena, right? Like, if you light a fire, it burns, or if you cool water, it freezes, or if you heat it, it evaporates."

"What you're imagining when you use magic."

"Exactly. It was well developed. By applying that knowledge, various convenient things were created."

I explained this to Og, but he seemed to have a hard time understanding.

Well, magical tools are things that work with magic.

It's impossible to understand any other principles.

"In my previous life, various phenomena were used, but the most commonly used one was electricity."

"Electricity?"

"Lightning, actually."

When I said that, Og, who was skilled in lightning magic, widened his eyes in amazement.

"Idiot!? Lightning is indeed a powerful force, but it's a kind of natural phenomenon! How can you use something like that!?"

"Simply put, I just said lightning, but you can't use natural lightning."

"Natural lightning... so, does that mean you can artificially create lightning!?"

"You can."

Og was astonished once again by that statement.

"Artificial lightning... there are several methods to generate electricity, but I don't know them all. I don't have that specialized knowledge."

"So, you mean you know some of them?"

"Yeah. It's done like this."

I drew a picture of a motor on a piece of paper.

Wind coils around the shaft and place magnets around it, a very simple one.

"If you pass electricity through here, the shaft rotates."

"...No, I'm not asking about how to use electricity, but how you generate it..."

"But if you rotate this shaft, electricity is generated."

Well, this is just a principle, and actual generators have a more complex structure, I suppose, but I don't know about that.

"I see... do you have this kind of knowledge inside you, then?"

"Well, only general knowledge, though."

"So, what kind of things were created using such principles?"

I answered Og's question as best as I could.

First, I mentioned that the cars I wanted to make were running all over the world.

In addition to cars, there were things like trains that could carry a lot of people at once, airplanes that could fly in the sky, and I even talked about venturing into space, leaving everyone in a state of amazement.

"Phew... I finally understand why you're so unconventional. What was common sense for you, surrounded by those things, must have seemed unconventional to us. And what you tried to recreate as a matter of course must have seemed unconventional to us."

"That's probably the result of growing up deep in the mountains. I didn't know what kind of things were circulating in the world."

"I see. By the way, when did you have those memories from your past life? Since birth?"

"No, I remembered my memories from my past life when I was taken in by my grandfather."

When I said that, Og looked apologetic.

"Sorry."

"It's fine. Well, because of that time, I don't know what my parents looked like."

"I see."

From there, we continued to talk sporadically.

Since I was reincarnated from a world without magic, I was so fascinated by practicing magic control that everyone found boring, and I pushed myself too hard.

I conducted magical experiments for fun, applying my knowledge of science from my past life. I talked about how my grandfather was the only one who knew the standard, and in my memories from my previous life, there were even more incredible weapons and such, so I thought what I was doing was still far from enough. Everyone seemed surprised, but they reluctantly understood.

This puzzled me.

"Um... aren't you all angry?"

"About what?"

Alice tilted her head in confusion in response to my question.

"Because, it's kind of... cheating..."

When I said that, everyone exchanged glances.

"Nobody thinks you're cheating, right?"

"Huh?"

Sicily's words were so unbelievable that I had to ask her again.

"Because, in the world where Shin lived, there was no magic, right? So you must have practiced a lot since being reborn here, right?"

"Well, yeah."

"So, Shin's magical power is the result of your hard work, isn't it? Nobody thinks it's cheating."

Sicily said this and gave me a warm smile.

Honestly, I was most afraid of Sicily's reaction when telling this story. She and I are already married. I had been living with such a significant secret. I had been afraid that she might abandon me if I confessed. But Sicily accepted it.

"Um... are you not angry, Sicily?"

"About what?"

"That I... kept this secret..."

"Well, to be honest, I feel a bit sad that you didn't tell me. But I understand that it must have been hard to talk about. So, I'm not angry."

"I see..."

"But..."

"Hmm?"

"...I wish you had told me alone. Then it could have been our secret."

Seeing Sicily looking embarrassed and saying this, I felt incredibly lucky. Despite hiding such a significant matter, Sicily still loved me the same. I couldn't help but find her adorable.

I couldn't help but hug Sicily, who was sitting next to me.

"Sicily..."

"Shin..."

"Sorry, but can we save that for later?"

"!!"

Thanks to Og's interjection, we snapped back to our senses and quickly distanced ourselves from each other, realizing that everyone was watching us.

Looking around, everyone was grinning.

"So, it looks like Mrs. Wolfort will be the first one to have a go at what we were talking about earlier, huh?"

Please don't bring up the topic of the mom friends again!

Oh, Sicily is blushing and hiding her face.

But maybe because of that, the atmosphere around us became more relaxed.

Honestly, I didn't expect that confessing about my past life would lead to this kind of atmosphere. I thought I was essentially cheating, so I expected to be blamed for it, but instead of criticism, I found everyone strangely accepting, and they continued to treat me as if nothing had happened.

I couldn't be more grateful for this.

"Thank you, everyone..."

"I don't know what you're thanking us for, but can we hear more details about it?"

"Sure, feel free to ask anything. I'll answer what I can."

"Alright, then... "

Og said this and started asking questions one after another.

The questions covered a wide range of topics, and there were many things I didn't know about.

I felt sorry for not being able to answer some of them.

However, when I talked about the main political systems in the world, Og seemed to be lost in thought.

"What's wrong?"

"Well... Hey, do you think there are other people besides you who have memories of another world?"

Ah, that's what he's getting at.

"There are... or rather, there were."

When I said that, Og's eyes widened.

"Do you assert that... which means you know who it is?"

"Yeah, do you know Masita?"

"The legendary magical tool artisan, right? Could it be that Masita had memories of a past life?"

"There are other suspicious individuals, but I'm sure about this one."

"Why can you say that?"

"Because my grandma let me read Masita's diary."

The one who reacted most to my words was Yuri.

"Masita's diary!? No way! Wolfort-kun, you have that?"

"I didn't own it, my grandma showed it to me. Maybe if you ask, she'll show it to you too?"

"Wow! That's unbelievable!"

"Whoa!"

Excited, Yuri hugged me.

I was sitting on the sofa, and Yuri was standing, so my face ended up buried in Yuri's chest.

My breath...

"Shin-kun..."

Yes, that sent shivers down my spine.

My left arm felt like it was freezing.

"Yuri-san... even though you have a girlfriend, this is quite indecent."

"Oh, I'm sorry, Sicily."

"Phew!"

When Yuri stepped back, I could finally breathe.

Thank goodness...

Dying from suffocation due to someone else's breasts, especially when you have a girlfriend, is absolutely unacceptable.

"Thank you, Sicily. You saved me."

I thanked Sicily for saving me from that predicament, and she pouted a bit.

"Burying your face in someone else's chest besides me..."

"No, it's not like I did it on purpose, right!?"

"...I'll overwrite that later, okay?"

Could I possibly resist Sicily's slightly sulking gaze with a coy look?

No, I couldn't!

"Yeah, please."

"Seriously, you two, cut it out."

Og, sitting in front of us, had veins popping out on his forehead.

"Sorry, so, what about Masita?"

"... Are we able to continue the conversation normally here? No, but I'm curious about this thing called democratic politics that Shin mentioned."

"Yeah, during my time, most countries had that."

"Does that mean anyone can become a politician?"

"In theory."

"In theory?"

"Of course, isn't that the case? Do you think someone with no political knowledge whatsoever can suddenly run in an election and win?"

"Well, I guess not."

"Most newcomers who won were lawyers, doctors, and highly educated individuals."

"Whether that's due to their higher education is debatable, but it's true that people with knowledge have an advantage."

"And celebrities."

"Celebrities?"

"Entertainment and sports figures were common. They already had high visibility, so they could gather votes easily."

"... Is that okay?"

"If they study politics properly, why not? Some of them held important government positions. So, what does this have to do with Masita?"

"No, it's not about Masita, but... I was thinking that there might be someone who has memories of a world like Shin's."

"Why?"

"Well... it's not the right time to discuss it now."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

After starting the conversation himself, he's saying it's not the right time now?

Did he just resolve that himself?

"By the way, why doesn't Lord Merida, who has Masita's diary, know about this?"

"Oh, that's about the diary. It was written in the characters of the previous world regarding the memories of the previous world. It happened to be the same as the characters used in the country I lived in, so I could read it. But my grandmother didn't know, so she only saw it as symbols."

"No way..."

"I'm using those characters for my magic."

As I said that, Shaolin-san twitched.

"That's not the original character but the character from the previous world?"

"Since the same characters were inscribed in Masita's magical tools. That's how I investigated."

"Wait a moment. Does that mean there were other reincarnated individuals in the previous civilization era like Lord Shin!?"

Shaolin-san exclaimed with a look of shock.

"I think so. Or rather, it's almost certain."

"What do you mean!? According to Lord Shin's story, the civilization only developed about a hundred years ago! The previous civilization must have been hundreds, maybe even thousands of years ago!"

"Even if you tell me that... perhaps the concept of time disappears when the soul crosses between worlds."

"Masita's story is about two hundred years ago. Maybe Shin's theory is correct."

"That's something only God knows."

There's no way to verify this.

"But... that means there were people with the same knowledge as Lord Shin, and they created that civilization..."

"Well, I don't think it was just one person."

"Huh?"

"You can't create something like that with just one person's knowledge. You need many people with various expertise to build such a city. Probably, there were several of them."

"Several people like Shin... I don't even want to imagine."

"Hey."

Maybe they already accepted that as a difference in common sense!

Indignant at Og's rude comment, Thor asked a valid question.

"But, is it really likely that there are people who conveniently have memories of another world? Let alone many of them."

"Certainly, that's true. It does seem too convenient."

Apart from Maria, others who agreed with Thor seemed to be questioning this.

"What about that? When you say it like that, don't you have any idea why it happened?"

In response to Og's question, I hesitated for a moment on whether to say it or not.

But in the end, I decided to speak up because I thought it would be better to let them know now and take precautions rather than have it come to light later as a secret.

"...I've mentioned before that I remembered my past life's memories when I was taken in by my grandpa, right? According to my grandpa, I was in a state of shock and temporary death due to the attack by monsters and the cold rain when I was rescued."

When I mentioned the term "temporary death," sitting next to me, Cecily tightly held my hand.

I grasped her hand in return and smiled at her.

"Grandpa said that I had started breathing again before he found me, right around the time he did. He found me after hearing my crying."

I said it in a gentle tone to reassure her, but Cecily still seemed like she might cry. She's probably thinking that experiencing such a thing when she was still around one year old is unimaginable.

Even though it's about the past, I was grateful for Cecily's feelings that made her think that way.

"So then, my grandpa used healing magic on me. It's a bit vague, but I remember some of these details."

"Does that mean you remembered your past life's memories when you recovered from your state of temporary death?"

"That's right. And in Masita's diary, there was something similar. Masita had a major accident in his childhood when he was hit by a carriage, and he teetered between life and death. When he recovered from that state, he wrote that he had both his previous memories and the memories of the life he was living in the past, and it confused him."

"Is that so?"

Og realized it quickly, as expected.

"Probably, when a child teeters between life and death during their early years, they might rarely remember their previous life's memories."

As I said this, Alice looked curious.

"Why is it rare?"

"Well, there are quite a few kids who teeter between life and death in their early years, isn't there? Whether due to injuries or illnesses."

I answered Alice's question, and Cecily added to the story.

"Yes, indeed. Sometimes, children in critical condition are brought to the clinic. But there's never any sign of them remembering their past lives."

"Exactly. So, it's quite rare."

"I see."

Alice was satisfied with this explanation.

"Um, what do you mean by 'early years'?"

Olivia, who hadn't participated much in the conversation until now, brought up a new question.

"Adults tend to hover between life and death more often than children, but such cases haven't been reported. And it's simply that there aren't many cases where it's believed that past life memories have been recalled. Also, this is purely speculation, but it might have to do with the fact that the brain isn't fully developed yet."

"So, are there others?"

"There's no solid evidence like with Masita. Captain Soro believes there might be some cases."

"Captain Soro? Is that Captain Soro from the Eagle ship?"

When I said that, Thor showed interest.

Thor is different from his appearance; he loves adventures and anything that's stereotypically boyish.

"Yeah, in Captain Soro's biography, there's something about his childhood. It talks about how, as a child, Soro fell off a cliff and suffered a severe injury. When he returned from the brink of death, he had become a genius."

"I see... That closely matches Shin's theory."

"We haven't found any concrete evidence, though."

Maybe there's a diary or something similar left behind like with Masita. The problem is that Captain Soro seems to be American, so the diary might be written in English.

But I think it might be interesting to look for Captain Soro's diary.

As I was thinking about this, Og suddenly had a shocked expression.

Ah, he noticed it.

"Hey, don't tell me... people from the previous civilization realized it and..."

Og's face turned pale as he talked about it.

Then, when thinking about the situation that implied, everyone else in the Min family also turned pale.

"Probably. People from the previous civilization might have deliberately pushed young children to the brink of death and then forcibly revived them with healing magic."

As I said this, silence filled the Min family's living room, as if everyone felt a painful weight in their hearts. with concepts
