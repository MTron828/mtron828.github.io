a charter
to start a film club

In addition to Els and East, the formal signing with the neighboring countries of the former empire will be decided through a conference of ministers from the participating countries of the alliance after the coordination of the finer details is complete.

Details such as the number of troops to be dispatched, supply responsibilities, and on-site allocation will be formally signed once an agreement is reached.

After parting ways with the Holy Kingdom of East's delegation in the Swied Kingdom, the delegation from the Els Free Trade Union and the Kingdom of Arlsheid are heading towards the capital.

Due to the remark about sending the handsome man and beautiful woman earlier, Maria and the others conveyed their requests to Mr. Naval's carriage, enhanced their bodies, and then jumped back to their own carriage. The members of the Els delegation were amazed at this, and the journey continued in a relaxed atmosphere.

The road they are traveling on, which they have passed before, is now filled with carriages and escorts from both countries' delegations.

However, with such a large group, it's only natural that something would come up.

"Multiple monster reactions from the left! Ranging from medium to large... What's this!?"

"What's going on? What happened!?"

"Seems like there's a disaster-level reaction!"

"What is it? What's happening!?"

The usual group of monsters has appeared again.

They encountered them on the way there, but now, disaster-level monsters have appeared on their way back.

"Is that... a bear?"

"Looks like it! It's an enormous bear!"

"Hahaha, a bear!? An enormous bear!?"

"This is bad... our lives are over..."

"If I knew this would happen, I should've just gone straight home without stopping at Arlsheid..."

The people from Els are mostly merchants, aside from the escorts. A bear, especially a disaster-level one, would certainly be a sufficient cause for despair.

"Why are you all so downcast?"

Oug, looking puzzled, speaks to the despondent Els delegation.

"Why, you ask!? It's a disaster-level monster! When such a powerful monster appears, you need a full army to deal with it. Why are you so calm... Oh..."

"Didn't I mention it earlier? We are all capable of defeating disaster-level monsters on our own."

"I see... Well, in that case..."

"Well, keep watching. Even the escorts should stay alert."

Oug says this and steps forward.

"So, what's the plan this time?"

"My father and the others aren't here this time, so I don't need to do anything special."

"In that case, I'll handle it."

While they were having this conversation, the horde of monsters was getting closer and closer.

"Oh, by the way... when you went to Littenheim Resort, you weren't there, right?"

"We can leave it to His Highness and the others. Honestly, I think their confidence is well-founded."

"Actually, it's quite rare for the one designated as the disaster-level target to be off the mark... it's just that those people call it a 'hit.'"

One guard answered another guard's question. Come to think of it, this guard was also present when I visited Julius's family.

"Now, since we're aiming to collect materials from other monsters this time, let's avoid explosive magic."

"No problem."

"Actually, isn't Shin the one who uses explosive magic the most!"

"...Alright, then, let's get ready for battle!"

"They're ignoring me..."

No, it's not like that. The horde of monsters really has come quite close by now.

"Alright, then... here we go!"

At my signal, everyone used their magic simultaneously. The main magic being used was water and wind blades.

They released the blades, aiming for the necks of the monsters one by one.

"Ah! I cut it in half!"

"Haha, I'm doing well... Ah."

"Lynn, it's not minced."

"I messed up."

"It's kind of like... playing a game."

"Hmm, you might not be entirely wrong. Oops, I messed up too, I cut it vertically."

Without moving from their initial positions, they proceeded to defeat each monster one by one carefully.

This is nice. It's perfect practice for precise magic. Recently, everyone has seen a significant increase in the amount of magic power they can control, and, due to the fact that I taught them the image of magic, they often rely on brute force. I'm not very skilled in using precise magic... or rather, I don't have much experience with it.

Maybe I should incorporate regular magic practice? The former empire, or what they're calling the "Demon Territory" after the recent talks, is overflowing with a large number of monsters, becoming quite a problem. It would serve as thinning them out, and it might be a good idea to consult with Oug once.

"But still, Shin, you're amazing."

"Yes, why can you shoot so precisely like that?"

Well, it's only natural that I can shoot magic precisely. "Because my opponents when I used magic were hunting targets, so I couldn't afford to explode them, right? I always aimed for the forehead with a single shot like this or went for the neck."

"I see, if you make a mess, there won't be any edible parts left."

"That's a valid point."

"But it's surprising. Mr. Walford, I always imagined you using high-powered magic."

"Come on, Olivia, isn't that a bit ruthless?"

"But, you know, in a way, Mr. Walford is actually amazing when it comes to precision. Magic tools require precise control of magic power."

These were the conversations taking place among the group while they were defeating monsters with magic.

Olivia, who could defeat monsters while chatting, was no longer just the daughter of a town's restaurant.

"It's reduced quite a bit. Well, it's time to go after the main one."

Tony said this as he retrieved a Vibration Sword from his dimensional storage.

"Alright, good luck!"

"Hehe, well... I'm off!"

With his jet boots activated, Tony jumped and landed in front of a bear that was about five meters long, soaring over the heads of the remaining monsters. He prepared to battle the beast while keeping an eye on the possibility of assisting if needed.

"Why... are you sending him alone!?"

"Hey! Your Highness August! What are you thinking!?"

"Huh? If it's Freid, he should be fine on his own. Well, just watch."

Although there were criticisms from the members of the delegation behind, Tony had already begun the battle. The bear raised its massive right arm and swung it down at Tony, but he evaded it by activating his jet boots. He had become quite skilled at handling them.

After avoiding the swing of the right arm, Tony also avoided the swing of the left arm and simultaneously leaped towards the bear's head. Despite the two previous strikes causing the ground to form craters, Tony dodged them quite effortlessly.

Then, instead of aiming at the bear's face directly, Tony flew slightly off-center and made a swift strike with his Vibration Sword. After that, he kicked the bear's shoulder and distanced himself from it.

The members of the delegation watched in awe, but we were already confident that the monster had been defeated. The bear, after being kicked in the shoulder, slowly toppled forward, keeping its head in the same position. As the body of the five-meter-long bear fell, there was a deep rumble on the ground.

Tony, who had defeated the bear without causing any harm to its body, returned to their group with a satisfied expression.

"Well done, you managed to defeat it cleanly."

"Yeah, it went pretty well, right? If I pushed it any further, I'd have to resort to precision shots to the forehead like Shin."

Well, with such a clean victory, there's really nothing to complain about.

"Whoa! That's incredible!"

"To handle a disaster-level monster so easily..."

"This is... their Highnesses are truly in a league of their own."

"Hey... isn't this too amazing?"

Members of the delegation and the guards were surprised, but, well, this was expected from Tony.

Now that they had defeated the main disaster-level monster, should they call it a day?

"Everyone, can we go ahead and wipe out the remaining ones?"

"Huh? Wasn't our goal to collect materials?"

"If we can blow them away all at once, I want to do it."

"We won't do that. Our goal is still to collect materials."

I plan to use a technique I often used when hunting cautious prey in the forest in the past to eliminate multiple targets.

First, I activate a magic called "Marker," with the intention of guiding it. I secretly lock onto the foreheads of the monsters.

After attaching markers to all the monsters, I create a large number of small water bullets that are guided toward the markers. Then...

"Charge! Go!"

I simultaneously fired the water bullets.

The numerous water bullets were guided towards the markers and hit the foreheads of the monsters without deviating from their slightly unnatural trajectories.

The remaining monsters... Alright, they were gone. The extermination was complete. When I turned to look at everyone, including the members of the team, all of them were dumbfounded.

"What... just happened?"

"Some of them landed with unusual trajectories, right?"

"Using magic that makes no sense again..."

"Sigh... Shin, you're amazing."

Shisiry's reaction was a bit different, but everyone else had astonished expressions.

"When dealing with cautious prey in the forest with a strong number, I often used this magic to ensure a clean kill. I didn't use it much for monster hunting, though."

"Still, it's too amazing. Both the delegation and we are surprised."

The members of the Els delegation were completely bewildered.

Well, I suppose this confirmed our respective strengths. It's necessary to assess each other's capabilities as we prepare to enter the Demon Territory.

In terms of military strength, Els doesn't seem to differ much from the Earlshide Army.

According to Oug's explanation, it appears that our power is distinctly superior to others.

We demonstrated our military strength, but unlike when we defeated the disaster-level monster, Navarre seems quite wary.

"Do you really... not intend to use the Dark Lord, or the Ultimate Magicians, as a unique military force for Earlshide?"

"What's wrong? Can't believe it?"

"I can't believe it... if you have this much combat power, it seems like conquering the world would be easy. With this level of combat power..."

So, that's what Navarre is concerned about. I didn't think about the balance of military strength because we prioritized training everyone to defeat the Demonoids.

"Well, then, shall we ask? Shin! Have you ever thought about wanting to conquer the world?"

"Hey! Your Highness August! That's a bit too straightforward..."

Oug asks, but the answer is obvious.

"No way, it's too much of a hassle."

"H-Hassle...?"

"Besides, what's the point of conquering the world?"

"What's the point...? You could have absolute power, create your own country as you like... do whatever you want."

"That's exactly why it's a hassle. To create your own country, you'd have to start from scratch, right? As a merchant, you should know how much of a hassle that is."

"I understand, but..."

"Also, until just a year ago, I was living in the deep forest with my grandparents, occasionally visited by my grandma and grandpa. I'm not interested in that kind of thing."

The world was self-contained in the forest. Besides, I'm originally from a commoner background, so I can't imagine having authority over others.

"Until now, I only had my grandparents' family, but now I have many friends, acquaintances, and... even a lover. You see, I care about these people."

Saying this, I look at Sishiry, as well as the rest of the team.

Sishiry looks happy, and the others seem a bit embarrassed.

"People who are dear to me..."

"Yes, to protect those dear people, I intend to wield my power. And also... for the sake of the children who will be born in the future, I want to create a peaceful world."

"Shin..."

Sishiry seems moved by the idea of our children, and she squeezes my arm.

"So, that's why I find conquering the world to be a hassle, and I have no intention of causing disturbances in the world."

"I see, it's a youthful and idealistic statement... but I understand if you're not interested in world conquest for those reasons."

Idealistic... it might sound that way when it comes to fighting for world peace, but this is my genuine feeling.

"In all honesty... I never thought my own power would be regarded with such caution..."

"Is that so?"

"I mean, when it comes to mages, I always thought everyone could use magic like my grandpa..."

"Ah, I see. I can now understand one reason why you're considered extraordinary."

"This is news to me. I never imagined Marlin was comparing his magical prowess to the rest of the world's mages..."

"Since my grandpa is an old man, I thought there were stronger people out there."

"That's quite a misunderstanding..."

"Even if I could surpass Sage-sama, I didn't stop training."

Various people came to visit my grandpa in the forest house, so I knew he was a great mage. But I only found out how truly great he was after coming to the capital.

I never thought he was such a legendary hero.

"I now have an understanding of the level of other mages. I understand that our power... the power of all of us is distinctly superior. Overwhelming power might cause unease, but... I believe it can be used effectively to maintain peace in the world. I think it would be great if we could work together to achieve that."

I wonder if they'll be satisfied with this explanation?

"I see, then we should make the Ultimate Magicians a peacekeeping organization together."

"Understood?"

"Yes, I apologize for doubting you. However, both Your Highness August and the Dark Lord, despite being so young, are truly impressive."

"Is that so?"

In my case, I have memories of growing up until my early twenties in my past life. Well, I restarted from infancy, so I can't simply add the two, but my thought process isn't that of a fifteen-year-old.

Oug, being of royal blood, sometimes looks much more mature than our peers. In general, he's a mischievous and cunning prince.

"In that case, we must discuss these matters, including this, in our future council meetings. Of course, our top priority is dealing with the Demonoids."

"Well, considering our long history with your country, we've already established a rough framework for the operation of the Ultimate Magicians. I think the proposed content is acceptable, but given that countries from all over the world will be involved, there will be a lot of coordination work."

"I see. We have a lot of matters to discuss, but it's a rewarding job."

"Hmm, didn't we initially try to appease Els's requests?"

"Hey! I thought we were sealing that as a dark history! Why are you mentioning it?"

"Oops, my apologies."

"Did you really say that, Mr. Naval?"

"Have you lost your business sense, blinded by immediate gains? Has becoming a diplomat dulled your merchant's instincts?"

"Enough of that!"

On the way back to Arlsheid, we continued to convey our abilities and my ideology to ensure that we were not a dangerous group. Even after that, we occasionally encountered monsters up to medium size, which our escorts took care of, and we finally returned to Arlsheid.

"Ah, it's been a while, Arlsheid."

"Mr. Naval, have you been here before?"

Of course, now he's a diplomat, but originally, he traveled around the world as a merchant. He visited Arlsheid, Ees, and Suid among other countries.

"Oh, I see."

"More importantly, Dark Lord! Let's go to the Trading Post soon! They might be open by now!"

Well... I highly doubt they'd open before I returned.

"Um... I don't think they'll open immediately when I return, so how about you all find lodgings for now? We need to obtain permission to purchase communication devices, and once we have a date for the store's opening, I'll contact you."

"That makes sense. Well, I'll find lodgings first."

Actually, I don't know which inn is the best, but now that I think about it, I have an innkeeper's daughter.

"Yuri, would it be possible to accommodate Els' people at your family's inn?"

"We'd be delighted to have the important guests from Els stay with us. Besides, we're planning to purchase that thing you're selling through Wolford's company and switch all our facilities to it. It'll be a lifesaver if you could let us know when it's opening."

Speaking of which, she mentioned before that if a certain product with a cleaning feature was released, she wanted to replace all the toilets in the inn with it.

"A certain product? Besides the communication device, are you selling something else?"

"Hehe, it's a surprise. You'll see once it's available."

Yuri really suits this kind of role. Mischievous or perhaps... a bit naughty.

The old men from Els seem to be blushing in front of a fifteen-year-old girl.

Afterward, we bid farewell to the Els delegation, who were going to the royal castle to obtain permission for the communication devices, and we were guided to our lodgings by Yuri. Then, we disbanded locally.

"Shin-sama! Young lady! Welcome back!"

"Alec-san, it's been a while. We're back."

"Welcome back."

"Your Highnesses, welcome as well. You must be tired from the Three Nations Meeting."

"Yeah, you're in the way."

"Alec-san, it's been a while. And by the way... we're back."

"Huh? What? Did I say something strange?"

"It's just that it sounded so natural."

"You've practically become a member of this household, Claude-san. Well, saying 'Mrs. Wolford' would suit you better."

"W-Wolford... Mrs.?"

Well, it will be like that in the future, but it took her by surprise. It was the first time she had heard it, which probably explains why Shisley's face turned as red as a tomato.

"Did anything change while we were away?"

"No, not really. Oh, but Lady Merida said there's something she needs to tell you once you return."

"Something she needs to tell us? I wonder what it is."

"Well... that's as much as I know..."

"Alright, I'll ask Granny about it. Thank you for your hard work."

"I-I appreciate it."

We offered our thanks to Alec-san and entered the house. This time, the maids and butlers welcomed us.

"Steve-san, is Granny here?"

"Yes. Lady Merida is... she's currently at the Claude residence, taking a bath in the hot springs."

The butler, Steve, took out his schedule book from his breast pocket to confirm Granny's schedule.

It seems that the butlers are responsible for managing our schedules, including mine, Grandpa's, and Granny's.

"She's at the hot springs, huh?"

"She seems quite pleased."

Ever since Shisley said she could freely use the hot springs at the Claude residence, she's been going almost every day.

"Isn't it a bit much to go every day?"

"Not at all. On the contrary, when Dad isn't there, there's hardly anything to do other than manage the estate, and the only ones present are Grandpa and Granny. So, some of the servants from the Wolford estate in the capital have requested to be transferred to the Claude domain."

"Is that so? But when you think about it, it makes sense. Although they come every day, they are the grandparents of the Claude family's young lady and are respected heroes from all over the world."

"I see, but it makes sense. They visit every day, but still, it wouldn't hurt to thank them. Thank you."

"You're welcome."

As Shisley and I had this conversation, the gate in the entrance hall opened, and Grandpa and Granny came out.

"Oh, you're back? Welcome."

"Hoho, welcome. Looks like everything ended safely."

"Yeah, we're back. So, Alex-san mentioned that Granny has something to tell me, right?"

"Ah, that's about the magical tool in the necklace you all are wearing."

"This?"

Granny initiated a conversation about the necklace, and we all sat down on the living room's sofa.

"First, let's confirm, this has 'Foreign Object Rejection,' right?"

"Yes."

"What's the definition of 'foreign object'?"

"Things that are unnecessary or harmful to the body."

"What about food?"

"Since nutrients are necessary for the body, it absorbs them."

"Hmm, I see that's how it is."

"What? 'I see that's how it is'?"

Granny had a look of understanding mixed with some concern. What's going on?

"Well, since I started wearing this necklace, I noticed an increase in the amount of waste I'm producing, and when I asked everyone, they had the same impression. So, I assumed that I must not be consuming an excessive amount of nutrients."

"What!? Does that mean no matter how much you eat, you won't gain weight?"

Maria was quite intrigued. Not gaining weight no matter how much you eat, it sounds like a magical dream tool.

"That's exactly how it is. But when that happens, there's a bit of an issue."

"An issue?"

"What about a fetus?"

"Huh...?"

A fetus... a baby?

"If this necklace rejects foreign objects from the body... and you get pregnant and wear this necklace afterward... wouldn't the fetus be recognized as a foreign object and cause a miscarriage?"

"Th-that is..."

There's indeed a possibility... no, I've heard that the cause of morning sickness is an allergic reaction where the body recognizes the fetus as a 'foreign object' due to the underdeveloped placenta.

A foreign object... it's recognizing it as a foreign object!

"We're in a crisis now, so it's not allowed to get pregnant anyway, so it doesn't matter. But once this commotion with the Demonkind is over, you'd want children, right?"

"Of course."

"Sh-Shin-kun..."

Oh, I just made a declaration about wanting children in front of Shisley. She looks fidgety.

"For now, it's okay to leave the enchantment as it is. But remember that you'll need to change it later."

"Yeah... I understand. Thank you, Granny."

If I hadn't been pointed out about this, it might have turned into the worst-case scenario. If that happened, I'm sure Shisley would have been truly depressed.

I'm glad we managed to avoid that. After this commotion is over, I should switch to an enchantment focused on maintaining health.

Oh, and should I switch Grandpa and Granny's enchantments too? It's not just infectious diseases; they could have internal issues as well.

"We want to see our great-grandchild's face, and we don't want to see our new grandchild suffer."

"Granny..."

Normally, Granny is strict and scary, but her true feelings show how much she cares about us.

Touched by Granny's kindness, Shisley is teary-eyed with gratitude.

"Thank you, Granny! I'll do my best to give birth to a healthy baby!"

... Oops, my face is getting warm.

I never expected to make a declaration that I'll do my best to give birth to a baby.

"That's a great determination... but are you sure it's okay?"

"What do you mean?"

"Everyone is listening, you know?"

"Huh? Oh!"

Shisley panicked and looked around to find Oug and Maria grinning.

"Y-yikes!"

Embarrassed, she buried her face in my chest.

"Well, this is a heavy responsibility."

"Yeah, it is. To give birth to a healthy baby, Shisley has to defeat the demons."

Oug and Maria join in teasing.

But it's true, isn't it?

It's not just for Shisley's sake but for all the future children we'll have. Our mission is to create a peaceful world for them.

"Geez! Stoopp!"

As Shisley clings to me even more, increasingly embarrassed, I reaffirm my commitment to see an end to this Demonkind commotion.

By the way, Shisley is quite soft... ideas
for what to do with my kids' art
