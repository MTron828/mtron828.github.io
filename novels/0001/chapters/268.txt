"Ugh... so busy..."

One day as the entrance exam for the Ultimate Magicians' new recruits approached, I found myself sprawled out on my office desk.

After a year of such activities, emergency assignments had become scarce, and we no longer had everyone going out every day like we did in the beginning.

In other words, the activities of the Ultimate Magicians weren't that busy.

"What's wrong? You seem really tired," Maria, who was on office standby today just like me, asked.

"Oh... I'm being pressured by Aug to hurry up with the typewriter production... and besides that, the infrastructure work for the fixed communication devices is starting, and we also need to prepare for that league we talked about..."

Aug had latched onto the typewriter topic I inadvertently mentioned here not too long ago and had requested that I develop it as a top priority. His enthusiasm was extraordinary, and he managed to persuade the higher-ups of the country to secure development subsidies. The higher-ups apparently unanimously approved Aug's presentation. How much frustration with paperwork must they have had?

Thanks to that, not only me but also the old man from Bean Workshop had no choice but to work on the development diligently. I know what the final product is supposed to be like, but I didn't know about the specific functions, so I'm experimenting and making adjustmentsâ€”like, "What should we do with this? How about that?"

On top of that, we were finally opening up the fixed communication devices to the general public. While the business itself had been transferred to the country, they sought our input on various matters along the way. Since I knew what the final form should be, but not the path to get there, trial and error continued. Especially with the exchange centers.

And as for that league, the magical volleyball game we started playing for fun had somehow spread to become a nationwide sport. That prompted the idea of creating a pro league and turning it into entertainment. Originally, it was planned to redistribute the steadily accumulating funds of the Walford Company to the public, but many people got interested in it. They established one pro team in each city within Earlside, and they would play home and away games throughout the year.

"More importantly, how are the entrance exams going? If you're that busy, any mistakes would be unacceptable, you know?"

"That should be fine. Aug is taking charge of the entrance exams."

Even though it's a subordinate organization, the Ultimate Magicians, a super-national organization, conducts exams to select members. Thorough background investigations involving multiple countries are carried out on the final exam candidates. It seems that some individuals have already been rejected.

...I had a feeling that such people would show up, but this level of thorough investigation can't be done by private individuals. That's why Aug is leading the investigation. In the end, those who pass the background investigation are planned to be further selected in the final exam.

Upon hearing this, Maria crossed her arms and wore a concerned expression.

"So, the fact that people got rejected means that some unsavory organizations were trying to infiltrate the Ultimate Magicians, right?"

"That's part of it, but it's not just that," I replied.

As expected, or rather, unsurprisingly, most of the rejected candidates seemed to be individuals chosen by Darm, but there were also several from other countries. And there were even some from Earlsheid.

"It seems there were also people with personal problems, or who had a bad track record. They rejected those people too."

"People who could potentially tarnish the organization's reputation, I assume."

"That's right."

As a result, a large number of applicants were significantly reduced. The remaining step would be to determine the new recruits through practical skills and interviews in the final exam. The reason for performing practical skills once again in the final exam was that only we could assess whether they had enough power to use the gates. Interviews were necessary because we couldn't judge a person without seeing them directly. There was even a suggestion to use Alma's pendant, which we had used before, to determine whether the applicants were lying, but that was considered excessive and was rejected.

The bottom line was, we needed to assess with our own eyes. Well, I think there shouldn't be any issues since we've conducted a thorough background investigation.

So, the final exam candidates for the new recruits will be determined soon, including the results of the preliminary exam. And once the final exam is over and successful candidates are chosen, training as members of the subordinate organization will begin. I'm in charge of that.

...

"You... aren't you in real trouble?"

"Can't someone help me...?"

Between the typewriter development, fixed communication device installation, launching a new form of entertainment, and even new employee training added on top of that... It's all piling up too quickly!

When I was hunched over my desk with my head in my hands, a gate opened in the office.

"The final exam candidates have been decided. Huh? What's wrong, Shin? You're hunched over at your desk."

Aug, holding some documents, emerged from the gate and tilted his head when he saw me.

"Oh, so if successful candidates come out of that final exam, Shin, you'll be responsible for new employee training, right? It seems like you're overwhelmed with work."

"Yeah..."

Aug muttered in a voice that seemed to show understanding and sympathy.

"Well, I thought it would be best to leave it to you, Shin, but maybe I'm overloading you... In that case, you can just focus on teaching them how to use the gates. We'll have someone else who has free time handle the improvement of other basic skills."

"That's a good idea. I'm fine with that," Maria added her agreement to Aug's proposal.

"Y-you guys..."

I was so moved by the kind words of my friends that tears were about to well up in my eyes.

I can't believe what wonderful friends I have!

"Being on office standby is boring."

Maria said this while stretching and stifling a yawn.

...Darn it! Give me back my sense of wonderment!!
