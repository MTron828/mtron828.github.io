 ideas
about how to plan my New Years resolutions

The ones who appeared from the gate were the heads of state of the three major nations in this world, the Pope of Yeast and the President of Els.

Without a doubt, they were at the top of the world.

These two casually showed up through the gate that the old man had opened.

Why?

"So it was the two of them after all."

"Oh, you figured it out?"

"Well, it was just a hunch."

Wait a moment.

I had heard there was a clue, but how could I have predicted this lineup?

Was there such a hint?

I had been thinking about that, but after a moment of confusion, everyone gathered here suddenly knelt down, clasped their hands, and lowered their heads.

Most of the people in this place were followers of the Creator God's religion. It was only natural for them to react this way when the Pope appeared.

The ones not kneeling were me, the old man and old lady who brought them, and Uncle Dis and President Aaron.

"Oh, no. Today is a birthday party, and the three of them are the guests of honor, right? So everyone, please stand up."

Ekaterina said to the kneeling crowd.

Ah, right.

This was our birthday party.

I had almost forgotten due to the shock.

"It would be a shame to ruin our birthday party because of us. We're just participants. Please treat us as such."

"Hmm. Then let's refocus and start the party. Everyone, stand up and hold your glasses."

Uncle Dis encouraged the still-kneeling crowd and said it was time to start the party.

"Now, to celebrate the birthdays of Shin, the hero of our country... I mean, the hero of the world, and his fianc√©e Sicily, and their best friend Maria... Cheers!"

"Cheers!"

Everyone hesitated, but they raised their glasses and the party began.

"Happy birthday, Shin, Sicily, Maria."

"Thank you."

"Thank you!"

"Thank you! Ah, the Pope said my name..."

(Note: The text appears to be a part of a story or a novel and might contain references to specific characters and events that are not explained in the provided passage.)

Sicily and Maria were deeply grateful that the leaders of their respective faiths had come to celebrate their birthdays. However, I couldn't quite understand why these two were here, so I gave them vague responses.

Why were they really here?

"Congratulations. This is the first time we're having a conversation like this, isn't it?"

"Well, yeah. Um, but why are you here, really?"

"There are some circumstances, but let's put that aside for now. First, let's enjoy the birthday party."

With that, Pope Ekaterina, along with President Aaron and Uncle Dis, went over to the old man and old lady.

With the three top figures of this world now moving away from us, everyone gathered around us.

"Congratulations to all three of you. But Shin, what on earth is going on?"

"Thanks. But, honestly, I have no idea. I'm in complete confusion too."

"Lord Merlin and Lady Merida's influence extends even to heads of state of other countries..."

Well, it was clear that the old man and old lady had brought them here. Could it be that their frequent absences from home were not due to visits to hot springs, but rather to meet with these two?

"Congratulations, Shin, Sicily, Maria. But to think the Pope would appear on my daughter's birthday..."

"Indeed, Cecilia and Sylvia would be disappointed if they heard about this."

"Wouldn't it be a problem if I'm the only one participating?"

Cecil mentioned her concern, and Irene stated that Cecilia's older sister Sylvia would be jealous as she was unable to return due to being on a mission.

Maria's brother and the representative of the Walford Company, Royce, appeared quite apprehensive.

Just how scary is his sister...

After that, we continued to receive words of congratulations one after another, and we finally reached the stage where we could receive presents.

Maria received many stylish accessories, and my presents were similar. However, since I had a habit of making things that ordinary people wouldn't think of, they all complained about how difficult it was to choose a gift.

Even though I appreciated anything given to me, it seemed that it wasn't as easy for the gift givers.

As for Sicily, for some reason, everyone chose baby items as presents and gave them to her.

Sicily's face had turned bright red due to the baby clothes and toys being presented one after another.

"Aah...!"

"Hey! Isn't everyone getting ahead of themselves?"

"Is that so? It seems that the situation will soon be resolved, and once it is, the two of you will become a couple, right? It won't be long."

Elie, who had brought a baby dress as a gift, said while looking puzzled.

But really...

"If you say that, Elie, you're no different."

"...That's true. I had completely forgotten, driven by the desire to see Sicily's embarrassed face."

This duke's daughter has been influenced too much by our group of girls. They were all wearing warm smiles, though it was hard to tell if they were genuinely happy or just grinning.

"Oh, um, Shin, what should we do with all these presents?"

Sicily, her face as red as her neck, asked what to do with everyone's presents.

What should we do...

"Just graciously accept them. You'll probably need them eventually, right...?"

"Shin, yes!"

Sicily blushed even more, and with moist eyes, she picked up the presents and started to sort through them.

"Is it going to be a boy at first? No, a girl might be good too..."

It seemed that Sicily's thoughts had already jumped into the future.

"It's amazing, Walford-kun. To accept even something as significant as children at your age..."

Lilia said.

Even though Tony had already earned quite a bit, she probably couldn't believe that he had accepted the idea of marriage, let alone the possibility of having children in the near future.

After all, they were all about the same age.

"By the way, have you been able to talk to the old man and old lady?"

"No! I, um, it's impossible! His Majesty and Pope Ekaterina and President came to be with Merida-sama! What's up with that otherworldly place!?"

For a high school girl, it's a harsh story to send her out to greet them.

Really, why are they here?

"Um, rather than that, I'm curious about the presents that Walford-kun prepared for you."

"Ah, that's right! Shin-dono! What on earth did you make!?"

I don't know if she was changing the subject or if she was genuinely curious, but Lilia-san seemed interested in the present I had prepared.

And when she remembered it, she approached Thor.

"T-Thor, calm down. The present I gave to Mark wasn't something strange, right?"

"Well, that's true, but..."

"The present for the two of them is the same. It's probably something that's not available elsewhere, but it won't undermine the work of existing craftsmen."

"Is that so?"

"So, the present I prepared for the two of them is..."

"Wait a moment!"

Just as I was about to show the present when Thor was pressing me, Maria stopped me.

"What's wrong, Maria?"

"Well, can we give ours first?"

"Sure, but why?"

"It's hard to follow up after Shin!"

The invited guests looked puzzled, but our team members nodded with an understanding expression.

"In that case, let me go first. Here, this."

Saying that, Maria handed me a small box.

Apparently, it was a leather bracelet.

"Shin seems to like this kind of thing. It's not a magical tool, but I made sure it's made from decent materials."

"Oh, really? Thank you!"

"You're welcome."

"Oh, um... from me too..."

Saying that, Sicily gave me a slightly smaller box than Maria's.

"Thank you, Sicily. Is this...?"

"Well... it's a ring. You've received several from Shin-kun, but I thought I'd never given you one."

"I see. Can I open it?"

"Y-Yes!"

With Sicily's permission, I opened the box.

What came out of it was a slightly wide silver ring.

"Wow! It's cool! Thank you, Sicily!"

"I'm glad you like it. So, um..."

"Hmm?"

After thanking Sicily for the cool design, she breathed a sigh of relief and hesitated a bit.

"Um... they match."

Saying that, she showed me the ring that she was wearing on her left middle finger.

It was the same design as mine, although hers was thinner. What's this? I'm really happy!

"They match... now that you mention it, we didn't have anything like that. Thank you, Sicily. I'm really happy."

"Hehe... I'm glad."

Sicily blushed as she smiled, looking cute and endearing.

"Oh..."

I pulled Sicily closer to me.

"Thank you, Sicily... I'm so happy."

"S-Shin-kun..."

I was overwhelmed with joy that she had prepared matching presents for us.

As Sicily and I gazed at each other, our faces drew closer...

"Don't just suddenly get carried away like this! You fool!"

"Ouch!?"

The impact to the back of my head brought me back to reality, and I realized that Grandma had appeared out of nowhere, standing behind me with her fists clenched.

"Don't do lovey-dovey things in front of such a large crowd! Honestly!"

Uh-oh. There are more people here today than ever before, including Sicily's parents and even her older brother.

I messed up in this situation!

"Eek!"

Sicily, too embarrassed to look around, buried her face in my chest.

I need to do something about this habit.

I might accidentally do something embarrassing in public someday...

"Um, well then, let's have you accept my present too."

Saying that to cover up my blunder, I took out a slightly larger box from my storage space than the ones Sicily and Maria received.

Both boxes contained the same item.

"It's a bit larger, isn't it? What's this?"

"I'll explain. Go ahead and open it."

"O-Okay!"

Maria and Sicily, who had somehow recovered, unwrapped the boxes and opened them.

Inside were two items.

"A brush? And... a stick? What is this?"

"I'll explain how to use them. Both of you, please have a seat."

I encouraged the two of them to sit down.

"When I said not to set your hair, it's because we'll do it here."

"Here?"

What I had sent them were a "hairdryer with a brush" and a "hair straightener."

In a world where bathrooms were commonplace, there were hairdryers available, but they were stationary and could only blow warm air. Brush dryers and hair straighteners like these did not exist.

So, although there's at least one in every household, it's not something that's frequently replaced. And since there were no artisans specializing in these items, I decided to create them as presents for the two stylish young ladies who would undoubtedly take good care of them.

"Hair? I understand the brush, but did you turn it into a magical tool?"

It seems they still don't understand how to use them.

It was a good thing I had given Marika-san a sample to try beforehand.

"Madam, Miss Maria, I have received instructions from Lord Shin regarding how to use these items. May I proceed to style your hair?"

"Huh? Is that so?"

"Very thorough... Okay, please go ahead."

"Of course."

Marika-san explained how to use the magical tools while activating them.

"When this is turned on, warm air will be emitted. When you remove this latch, you can use it to hold your hair like this."

She demonstrated how to use the magical tools while explaining.

"This brush dryer allows you to style your hair freely. Like this..."

Marika-san first started styling Maria's hair using the brush dryer.

As expected of a woman, Maria's hair was quickly given a soft and fluffy style.

"Wow! Amazing! Hey, can I give it a try too?"

"Yes, please go ahead."

Maria received the brush dryer from Marika-san and began styling her hair on her own.

"Wow! Amazing! You can easily style it!"

Maria was amazed as she used it herself.

Now, let's use the other hair straightener to style Sicily.

"This part of the iron heats up, and you can clamp your hair like this."

"Oh, my hair... it's unbelievably straight..."

Sicily opened her eyes wide as her hair was straightened by the hair straightener.

After straightening her hair, she put it up and made a final touch with the hair straightener.

She took the hair on the sides and rolled it up with the straightener, creating beautiful curls.

"This... this is so easy! Amazing, Shin! Thank you!"

"Thank you, Shin! This is the most incredible present I've ever received!"

I'm glad they both seem to like it.

"This is a completely new product, so it won't compete with existing companies, right?"

"That's true, but... What's really going on in Lord Shin's head? How do you come up with one amazing thing after another?"

My head is filled with memories from my past life.

I can't say something like that, so I tried to laugh it off, but I immediately felt a chill down my spine.

What's going on!?

Thinking that, I looked around...

"Shin-san! What's that? What's that you have!?"

"Wolford-kun! I want it too!"

I found myself surrounded by women with fierce expressions.

Wait! This is scary!

"Shin-kun! Can I have one too? Can I?"

And even the Pope joined in the fray!

"Haah... Sorry, I got carried away."

"N-No... It's fine."

"This magical tool is fascinating! Do you have any plans to sell it?"

"Our workshop is already in full production. Well, if I give them to all of you here, it would defeat the purpose of a birthday gift, so please purchase them."

"When! When will they be released?"

Perhaps because of her fluffy hairstyle, Ellie has been enthusiastic about it from the beginning.

"They haven't been released yet, but I'll offer them in advance to everyone here. Any interested parties... which seems to be all the ladies..."

At that, all the ladies raised their hands, including Royce.

Why?

"I need to secure them for my little sisters. You never know what might happen or be said if I don't..."

No, no. You're the representative of the Wolford Company. You should sell them through your own company.

I thought that, but I couldn't say something like that to Royce, who had a distant look in his eyes, so I kept it to myself.

He really seems to be afraid of his two sisters-in-law.

But still, while I did have my father's approval that it would sell to women, this is beyond my expectations.

I might have to expand the workshop again...

"Ahem! Well, then, here's a present from us."

Saying that, Pope Ekaterina took out a small wrapped box.

"Eh? From Pope Ekaterina too?"

"Wow... Thank you!"
