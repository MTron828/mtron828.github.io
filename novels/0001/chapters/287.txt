After arresting the legislator I was in charge of with an arrest warrant and apprehending the ruffians who had gathered at the lord's mansion for obstructing official duties, I returned to the conference room of Darm.

"Good job, Shin. Did it go well?" Ekaterina greeted me as I returned, inquiring about the progress as if a mother were asking her son if he had completed an errand.

"I did it properly. But why do you ask in such a motherly way?"

I replied in amazement, and Ekaterina smiled deeply.

"Because it's natural for a mother to worry about her son..."

"Aw, cut it out! That's why I told you to stop!"

I panicked and looked around.

The people around, seemingly aware of the rumors, gave me knowing looks and cast warm glances.

Ugh... It seems this has spread beyond just our family...

As I was overwhelmed by this reality, the gate opened.

"I'm back."

"Welcome back, Your Highness. Was it successful?"

"We captured them properly. No one was killed."

"I see. That's good."

Ekaterina said that and smiled, looking satisfied.

But really, both me and Aug are twenty-two years old. Aug already has one child... soon to be two, and I'm a father of three. I wish they'd stop treating us like children.

"Hmm, it seems others have returned as well."

While having such a conversation with Ekaterina, the gate opened one after another.

"Thank you all for your hard work."

"Oh, Your Holiness! We've just returned!"

"Yes, thank you for your hard work."

"We've completed the arrests."

"Well done."

"They surrendered immediately, so it was resolved without any chaos."

"Oh, that's wonderful."

"I had to give them a bit of a beating. But I didn't kill anyone."

"Oh dear, they put up a fight, didn't they? Is anyone injured?"

Maria, Tony, Mark, and Lynn reported their successful missions one by one, and Ekaterina offered words of praise to each of them.

Their interactions were indeed like that of a caring mother.

Ah, I see. Ekaterina isn't treating us like children, but rather, she sees everyone as her own children.

So, regardless of the other person's age, she responds to them like a mother. I can understand her attitude now.

"Oh, Shin-kun, I'll be going home after this. Tell me about what happened earlier."

I know the reason, but I wish she would stop.

I couldn't help but feel exasperated by Ekaterina's unconventional and often misleading behavior.

Aug even told me, "Such actions make you seem like a son troubled by your mother's behavior." What am I supposed to do?

With all this going on, we managed to eliminate all the troublemakers within Darm and restore the monarchy.

Although Heero had abolished the monarchy, he had left the royal family intact as a symbol because he had memories from his previous life.

The former nobility had their titles revoked one day, but they were originally involved in the administration. It seems the lawmakers, who were only interested in their own privileges, didn't know about this, but many of the former nobility had been working as government officials.

As for those who couldn't even do that, it's unclear what they are doing now.

Well, according to those who have returned to their noble status, such individuals were problematic as nobles and lacked any ability, so they were left alone. In fact, they were pleased that they could eliminate useless nobles without incurring their wrath. Nobles are quite terrifying.

I discussed with Ekaterina the conversation I had promised to have with Heero when I returned to the Wolford family.

I shared about how Heero and I both had memories from a different world and were probably from the same hometown in our previous lives. Heero realized this.

Even though we were both reincarnated from the same world, I was the only one who ended up in an environment with privileges. Heero became jealous and resentful, and out of hatred towards me, he consumed forbidden magic stones that haven't been publicly disclosed here, leading to his transformation into a demon.

After I finished my explanation, Ekaterina's expression turned solemn.

"In our previous lives... Yes, it all makes sense now."

Ekaterina murmured meaningfully.

"Well, what do you mean?"

"Remember when we first met, Shin-kun? I asked if you were an angel sent by God. At that time, Shin-kun, you were a bit shaken, weren't you?"

"Ah, now that you mention it, yes, that did happen."

"You were shaken then because you had inherited memories from your previous life. You thought it might be reflecting some divine intention, right?"

"Yes, that's right. Well, I haven't actually met God, but I did consider that possibility."

"Listening to your story now, I finally understand that mystery. It's such a relief."

"I see. But still..."

"What is it?"

"Well, not just you, Ekaterina-san, but I feel like no one is surprised by this, no matter who I talk to."

"That's right. In fact, now that we know the cause of your extraordinary power, it only makes sense."

As Ekaterina said this, even Aug and Cecily, who were present, nodded in agreement.

Well, it's all fine now.

A few days after this exchange, the interrogation using truth-enhancing magical tools was conducted on the captured former legislator and those around him. As a result, it was discovered that the initial perpetrator who targeted Ellie was indeed a member of the Ulst family, a city official involved in the unprecedented act of issuing fake citizen certificates and hiding their true identities. Given the heinous nature of the crime, and the fact that they had attempted to harm the Crown Princess of Arlsheid twice, it is said that the legislator will undoubtedly face the death penalty.

Other lawmakers were found to be involved in corruption, covering up crimes, and even illegally trafficking drugs to other countries. While they may not receive the death penalty, they are likely to face substantial sentences. It is predicted that they will not be released during their lifetimes.

Darm is now preparing to discard the system established by Heero and return to a monarchy. However, as the city and the nation's top officials change, the transition is not expected to create significant turmoil. Nonetheless, political changes can often lead to deteriorating security, so various countries have cooperated by dispatching troops to patrol the entire nation. Those who try to exploit the situation during this period will face more severe consequences than before.

The new king of Darm is expected to be a nephew of the previous wayward king, and he is only eight years old. Until he comes of age and can govern the country on his own, the Holy Eiess Kingdom will serve as the temporary ruler of Darm.

From the Holy Eiess Kingdom, a person holding the title of "Governor of Darm" will be dispatched to rule over Darm.

It feels like some sort of limited-term colonial rule.

However, there doesn't seem to be any aversion from the people of Darm to being governed by the Eiess. If this were any other country, it might have led to a more chaotic civil war.

Considering that Darm was the one facing turmoil and that there was the Eiess Holy Kingdom to keep it in check, it was fortunate.

The remaining task is the verification of Heero's transformation into a demon.

Regarding this matter, the magical world has been shifting towards increasing the control of magical power, raising the overall level. However, an increase in magical power also comes with an increased risk of going out of control.

Furthermore, it's known that the risk of demon transformation is higher when harboring anger and hatred. The actual threshold of magical power required for demon transformation is still unknown.

However, if the trend is to increase magical power, this will be an issue to contend with in the future. Thus, a proposal was made to mandate that individuals who can handle a certain level of magical power must wear magical devices to prevent it from going out of control and stabilize it.

The proposal came from Aug.

The proposal was immediately accepted, and the request for this work came to me again. So, I continue to spend my days in Bean's Workshop and my own workroom. As a result, I have no time to play with Sean, Sharl, or Silver.

However, creating these magical tools is necessary to ensure that mages are not seen as a danger in the future. While I feel envious hearing the cheerful voices from downstairs, I work diligently and have finally created magical tools that can constantly stabilize and prevent magical power from going out of control.

Thanks to this magical tool, even with some reckless training, I no longer experience magical power going out of control. This invention led to the suggestion that it could be used not only by adults with a certain level of magical power but also by children with unstable magical power. After several tests, a bill allowing children to use magic as long as they wear this magical tool was passed.

As a result, the age at which children can start learning magic has been lowered. This age corresponds to when Mei-chan began learning magic at the age of ten.

So, through this series of events, the world has changed again, and even the family structure has shifted, but I am living peaceful days. I hope these days continue...
