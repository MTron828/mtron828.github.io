for a retro-style arcade game

With the general's guidance, we made our way to the courtyard of Yuhou Palace.

There, something like a covered cannon was placed, and soldiers guarded its surroundings.

I thought it was quite heavily guarded, but perhaps it was necessary. After all, weapons excavated from ruins must be declared to the state. However, Hao, the top bureaucrat involved in politics, had been in possession of it, ignoring the obligation to report it. Perhaps it possessed enough power to scheme the overthrow of the nation, so it was only natural to have strict security.

As the general approached, the soldiers on guard saluted and welcomed him.

After conveying something, the soldiers nodded and removed the cloth covering the weapon. What appeared before us was a long and large chunk of iron.

"This is it. At first glance, it doesn't look like a weapon..."

"Indeed."

The weapon that Hao owned and had been concealed was made up of two parallel, straight iron bars fixed in place by the surrounding armor.

I thought it was a cannon at first, but with this shape, it wouldn't shoot projectiles straight. I couldn't figure out what kind of weapon it was.

"That's exactly what I thought when I first saw it as a weapon, but this shape doesn't seem like it would shoot projectiles straight. I have no idea what kind of weapon this is."

"I agree..."

I had a certain level of confidence in identifying the true nature of this weapon just by looking at it. To confirm, I decided to ask more questions.

"Do you know what kind of weapon this is and what it does?"

The response to my question came from Hao's former adjutant.

"Yes. When it was excavated, Hao activated it thoughtlessly..."

"Thoughtlessly... without even checking for safety?"

"Yes. Just as the general mentioned earlier, it didn't look like a weapon at first glance, so we wanted to confirm its magical effects immediately."

The former adjutant looked grim as he spoke.

"When Hao activated this, there was an enormous deafening sound. It was as if we had heard a cannon firing at close range."

As he said this, he looked at the tip of the weapon.

"Most likely, something was fired from between these bars. The upper bodies of those in the line of fire disappeared..."

It seemed like he was recalling that moment, and his expression turned grave.

"I saw it at that moment. The flash was heading towards the horizon. And... it was shattering a large rock in its path."

The former adjutant said, and silence enveloped the surroundings.

The one to break the silence was the general.

"Given that someone who actually saw it said that, there should be no mistake... But what on earth is it? Is it a projectile, or was it something magical, or even something else entirely? We don't even know that."

The general said this and let out a long sigh.

"So, have there been no further experiments?"

"If what this person says is true, this is an incredibly powerful weapon. We can't just experiment with it here, especially in the Emperor's residence and the political center."

Certainly, experimenting with a high-powered weapon here would be out of the question.

I glanced at the former adjutant who had been at the excavation site. He shook his head as well.

"Not only is this powerful, but the noise it makes is quite loud too. Hao prohibited further testing to avoid drawing attention."

As the former adjutant said this, the general snorted.

"If someone finds out, we'll have to report it to the nation. Then we won't be able to keep it for ourselves. Just this alone could raise suspicions of treason against the nation!"

It seemed that the general had a strong dislike for Hao's actions.

"So, we haven't conducted further experiments."

The former adjutant concluded.

"So, we have absolutely no idea what this is. I showed it to you in the hope that you might get some hints."

"I see."

Even though we were part of the diplomatic delegation, I had thought they would easily show it to us.

Kwanglun and the Western world had different approaches to the development of magic. So, they were probably hoping that our knowledge might provide some insights.

Honestly, the general's intentions were correct. I had figured out the true nature of this, but it wasn't something to be casually mentioned.

I thought about this and looked at everyone.

Among the curious faces, I noticed two people deep in thought.

Mark and Yuri.

"What is it? Physics? Magic?"

"Then why is it shaped like that?"

"But even if you say that, I specialize in enchantments. When it comes to such shapes, it's Mark's specialty, right?"

"Sorry, but we've never made cannons or anything like that."

"I haven't either."

"What is it, I wonder?"

"I have no idea."

They seemed quite friendly. Were they that close?

Well, leaving that aside, the issue was that we didn't know the successor of the Bean Workshop's heir, even though the Western world people wouldn't naturally know.

"Sorry. Just this isn't enough to figure it out."

When I said this, the general looked disappointed.

"I see... I thought there might be a chance..."

Although he said "might," he must have had quite high expectations.

Seeing the general's disappointment, I couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt.

However, this was not something to be spoken about lightly. If my guess was correct, it would mean a powerful weapon that anyone could use. So, I didn't reveal the whole truth.

But perhaps it would be a good idea to confirm it at least.

"Excuse me."

"What is it?"

"Could you please show me the inscriptions on this weapon?"

When I said this, the interpreter, Shaolin, looked sharp.

"Inscriptions? I don't mind, but this is an ancient relic. The inscriptions on it are different from modern ones, and no one can read them..."

"Yes, I've heard that. I'm just curious."

"Curious, huh?"

The general said this and looked at me with a probing look.

He did so for a while, but then he relaxed his expression.

"Well, it's okay. Even if you know the shape of the inscriptions, without knowing the effect, you can't enchant it."

"I'm sorry for being so self-indulgent."

"Well, it's no big deal."

Anyway, with the general's permission, I used the magic tool to make the inscriptions on this object appear while being careful not to activate it.

And the moment I saw those inscriptions, my initial guess was confirmed. If I hadn't prepared myself in advance, I might have inadvertently spoken out loud.

The revealed inscription was written as follows:

​1​

In other words, this is...

(A railgun...?)

In my past life's memories, a railgun was a massive weapon, like a building. It was because, in my era, the devices needed to generate the power required for a railgun couldn't yet be miniaturized. So, it was planned to be adopted as shipboard weaponry.

However, this world had magic. Upon closer inspection, not only was the enchantment "Electromagnetic Induction" present, but "Magic Power Collection" was also inscribed. In other words, if activated, this weapon would autonomously gather magic power from its surroundings. And once enough magic power had accumulated, it would induce electromagnetic propulsion to launch a projectile. It didn't require large capacitors to generate significant electric power. The enchantments covered everything.

Nevertheless, it made me wonder. People from the previous civilization in my past life didn't seem to exercise much restraint. Creating a powerful magical tool that anyone could use... it was a surprising discovery.

After confirming the enchantments, I peered between the two bars one last time.

"What's the matter, Shin? Did you figure something out?"

While I was conducting my final inspection, Oug's voice reached me.

"No... I still don't understand."

I replied to Oug on the spot. If I were to say I understood it here, Shaolin would probably look at me with suspicion again.

"I see."

Oug's response seemed somewhat dissatisfied. His eyes seemed to be saying, "You really didn't understand, did you?"

I looked toward Shaolin... and yes, she was still casting a suspicious glance my way.

With the final check completed, I addressed the general.

"I'm sorry, and thank you."

"Indeed. Did you figure something out?"

"No, not really. I just thought that there are some unusual weapons in the world."

"Yes, indeed. Among all the excavations we've done, this one is particularly peculiar."

"Thank you for accommodating us, even though it might have been inconvenient. In that case, we'll take our leave."

"Yes, and thank you. Thanks to you, we may be able to punish Hao as a rebel aiming for the overthrow of the nation."

"I see. As for the negotiations..."

"I'm sorry, but could you wait here until we settle down? We need to select a new negotiator as well."

I looked at Oug, and he nodded, so I handled the response.

"Understood. When the date for negotiations is decided, please contact the Min household."

"Roger."

And so, we left Yuhou Palace.
