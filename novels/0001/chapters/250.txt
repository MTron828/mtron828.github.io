for a fashion-focused exploration of Paris

I'm an advocate for respecting one's wishes, so I'd like to let Sicily do as she says.

But...

"Maybe you don't have to rush so much? Like Olivia, you can return after giving birth..."

"I'm not going to the location like Olivia; I'll be waiting at the treatment center, so I can return before giving birth. Plus, I'll take some time off before and after birth, so I want to return as soon as possible."

I personally think it would be fine for Sicily to return after giving birth like Olivia, but it seems Sicily's determination is strong. Although she can't use magic right now, she wants to return as soon as possible when she can use magic.

"Well, we've discussed this thoroughly already, so I won't say more, but be careful."

"Yes, I understand."

Chris-nee-chan watches Sicily smile and say so.

"It's envy-worthy how Shin understands like that."

"By the way, is Zeke-nee-chan and Chris-nee-chan's hometown the capital?"

"Yes, that's right. So, we suggested leaving the child with one of the parents, but that man..."

It seems her anger has resurfaced.

Sigh... Since it's another family's matter, I can't interfere, and they'll have to work it out together.

Thinking that, I sit down next to Sicily while holding Silver.

At that moment, I notice a book on Ellie's lap, which is across from us.

"Oh, Ellie, are you reading a book too?"

"Yes. Wait, 'too'?"

"Yeah, we were talking about books at the office earlier."

I tell her about our conversation at the office. Ellie looks a bit surprised.

"That's quite a coincidence. The book I was reading is also a new release from Amelie."

"Oh, is that the one where the prince falls in love with a commoner girl?"

"Yes."

"Doesn't that bother you, Ellie? Catalina was worried that it might upset Augus."

"Not at all. It's a fictional story from a fictional country. I don't mix it up with reality. In fact, because it's so detached from reality, I can enjoy reading it."

"I see, so it's like that."

"It is indeed."

She's saying the same thing as Augus.

Even though the roles of a prince and fiancée are the same, it seems that with different circumstances, it looks like pure fiction.

Oh, by the way...

"I've read a few novels like that, where the fiancée is bullied by other noble girls. Did you experience anything like that, Ellie?"

I asked out of curiosity, and Ellie let out a deep sigh with a somewhat troubled expression.

"Even though I'm a duke's daughter, I wasn't bullied, but..."

She hesitated, and instead of the reluctant Ellie, Sicily answered.

"Come to think of it, there was someone who confronted Ellie when His Highness and Ellie-san got engaged."

Now that I think about it, Augus and Ellie got engaged before entering the high school.

So, Sicily must know about the situation from back then.

"By the way, when did you two get engaged?"

"It was in our first year of middle school."

"As expected of royalty. That's early..."

"They first met when they were five years old, so you could say they're childhood friends who got engaged!"

Olivia, who was listening nearby, seemed to feel a sense of closeness because she also married her childhood friend.

"When we announced our engagement, there was a silly girl who said things like 'I'm more suitable than you!' and 'Just withdraw from the engagement!'"

Ellie talked about the noble girl with an exhausted expression, just recalling her.

"Augus and Ellie had a love marriage, right? I heard Augus was the one who confessed and proposed."

"But that person didn't see it that way. She believed she would marry His Highness and even boasted to others that he would propose to her soon."

"Why did she have such a misunderstanding?"

The fact that Augus might propose to her soon must have had some signs, right?

Would Augus act in a way that could lead to such a misunderstanding?

In a situation that seemed quite improbable, both I, Sicily, Olivia, and Chris-nee-chan tilted our heads in confusion.

"It seems that person was utterly convinced that she would marry Augus. She had been bragging to everyone around her that she would be proposed to by His Highness very soon."

"Why did she have such a mistaken belief?"

I heard that she always loitered around Augus at the academy, but one day, Augus picked up a handkerchief she dropped and handed it back to her. After that, she seemed to believe she was dating him."

"Oh... That's not just strong wishful thinking, it sounds more like delusional behavior..."

When I looked at Sicily's face to confirm if such a person really existed, she had a wry smile on her face.

"Yeah, there was such a person."

"There really was one..."

To think that such a person existed at a noble academy...

Ah, I see, that's probably why. Most likely, from a young age, she could have anything she wanted, and her actions and existence were constantly affirmed. So, she might have deluded herself into thinking that she could always get what she wanted.

I've heard that in Arlsheid, nobles are taught from a young age that they exist for the people, but I guess there are exceptions to that.

Was she spoiled too much as an only daughter?

"She used to come to my place every single day, screaming things like 'His Highness and I are in love' or 'Don't interfere with my relationship with His Highness.'"

"If she made that much noise, didn't it reach Augus's ears?"

"Of course, it did. Augus came to the scene where she was screaming at me, and he said to her, 'Who are you?'"

"Wow, that's tough..."

To be asked, "Who are you?" by someone you believed you were dating...

If she found out that not even recognition was given to her...

"While the bewildered girl was left behind, Augus addressed the crowd and said, 'Everything that person just said is false. I won't trust anyone who believes or utters it.' So, no strange rumors spread."

Wow, that's impressive, Augus, for handling it like that.

It seems Ellie also remembered that incident and looked a bit proud.

However, Sicily, who was watching Ellie in that moment, was chuckling.

"What's wrong?"

"Hehe, nothing. Ellie-san skipped a certain detail, and I found it amusing."

"Skipped a detail?"

"Hey, Sicily!"

Ellie rushed to stop Sicily, but Olivia, who was sitting next to Ellie, acted as a guard.

"Indeed, His Highness did say that," she said, "but at that time, he said it while pulling Ellie-san closer to him."

"Oh, I see."

While wondering if the situation really happened as described, I looked at Ellie...

She had a bright red face and was covering her face with both hands.

"Wow! His Highness really is like a passage from a romantic story!"

Olivia was teasing Ellie, who was blushing.

Watching the two of them, Chris-nee-chan let out a small sigh.

"I'm jealous. I don't have any romantic memories like that."

"By the way, Chris-nee-chan, what about you? Honestly, I can't imagine the history that led to your current situation from that of those two."

"Huh?"

In response to my question, Chris-nee-chan looked a bit startled, as if she didn't expect the conversation to turn to her.

"Oh, that's interesting. Please tell us how Lady Chris and Sir Zeke got married."

"I'm curious too!"

"That's right! It's not fair for me to be the only one to feel embarrassed!"

"Wait, this is... Your Highness, your words are strange!"

"There's nothing strange about it! Now, spill the beans!"

"Ugh..."

Oh, as a knight serving the crown, can I really go against the orders of the Crown Princess?

I might finally get to hear Chris-nee-chan and Zeke-nee-chan's story.

Just as I thought that, something happened.

"Oh! Incoming call! It's an incoming call!"

The wireless communicator on Chris-nee-chan's belt rang.

Ignoring the annoyed Crown Princess, Chris-nee-chan answered the communicator.

"Yes!... Oh, now?... At Shin's place... What? Come home? Who do you think you are... Huh?... Alright, I'll head home now."

Based on the conversation, it seemed to be Zeke-nee-chan. He had called to tell his wife, who had run away from home, to come back.

"Sorry, Your Highness. I'm going home, so let's forget about this conversation."

"Hey, that's not fair!"

"Shin, open the Gate, please."

"Oh, but..."

Sicily also seemed interested in hearing the story, so I hesitated to comply with Chris-nee-chan's request.

"Shin."

"Yes, understood."

Chris-nee-chan's voice was so stern that I immediately connected the Gate to Chris-nee-chan's house.

"Well then, excuse me, Your Highness. We'll see you later, Shin."

After Chris-nee-chan made a polite farewell to Ellie, she waved to us and passed through the Gate, heading back home.

"Oh, I thought we could hear more about Christina-sama and Siegfried-sama's story."

Olivia expressed her disappointment, and just then, her communicator rang.

"Huh? Me?"

While saying this, Olivia answered the communicator.

"Oh! Sorry! If Wolford-kun is back, then Mark should be back too, right? Yeah, that's right, at Wolford-kun's house. Okay, I'll be waiting."

It seemed that the call was from Mark, and he was coming to pick up Olivia, who was in the early stages of her pregnancy and couldn't use magic.

Shortly after, Mark came to pick up Olivia, and at the same time, Augus also arrived to pick up Ellie.

"Sorry for the trouble, Mrs. Wolford. See you, Shin, until tomorrow."

"Sure, see you tomorrow."

I bid them farewell, making sure not to smirk about our previous conversation.

Afterwards, Miranda and Natasha, who had been quiet, left on foot from the front door.

In the now quiet living room with everyone gone, I asked Sicily something that had been on my mind.

"By the way, what happened to the noble girl who confronted Ellie? I was curious about what happened to her after causing such a commotion."

After all the fuss she had created, I couldn't help but wonder about her fate.

"Huh? Well, after that, she left the royal capital's academy and transferred to her family's academy. I don't know what happened to her after that."

"I see. Maybe she was too embarrassed to stay at the academy?"

"That's what I think, but I don't know the details."

It didn't seem likely that Sicily had any interactions with that noble girl, so it was understandable that she didn't have more information. Regardless, I had thought that Augus and Ellie's relationship had always been smooth, but it turned out there was a past incident like that. I'll have to ask Mark and Olivia about it next time. We know everything from the confession onwards, so I have a right to know!

At least, that's what I think.
