Translation:

Strom had, in a way, coerced us into agreeing to participate in a game that would determine the fate of the world. We left a few soldiers behind as guards, while the rest were sent back to their respective countries via the gate.

The decision was based on the fact that Strom had surrounded the entire area, including the former imperial capital, with a massive wall, and it appeared that he was enjoying this situation. Thus, it was judged that there was no need to break through the wall and launch an attack.

We returned to the royal capital of Earlsheid along with Garan and the commanders of various nations before the upcoming conference. This was to consult with the commanders who were at the scene.

Although it was called a consultation, the real discussion was likely to focus on how to strengthen our forces within the short deadline of one month.

Can we really accomplish anything in such a short time? The expressions on everyone's faces as they walked through the corridors of the royal palace toward the conference room were uniformly somber.

...In this desperate situation, I'm willing to give it my all, no matter how others might perceive me.

"I'm sorry, Shin."

In this seemingly hopeless situation, I was suddenly apologized to by Oug.

"What are you apologizing for?"

"We took the inaugural ride of the carriage you made."

Ah, that. I heard it was quite an emergency situation, so I have no intention of making a big deal out of it.

"Don't apologize for something like that. It was an emergency, so it couldn't be helped. Oh, but..."

"What is it? Is there something that's bothering you after all?"

Oug apologized to me, but I'm not so narrow-minded as to bring that up during an emergency.

However, there was one thing that left me with some regret.

"Well... it's just that I didn't get to see everyone's surprised faces when they first rode on that carriage."

When I said that, Oug gave me a puzzled look.

"Ah, I was certainly surprised... What's with that carriage? I heard it doesn't shake, and it's fast..."

"The temperature inside was comfortable, and it had something like a refrigerator."

"The interior was bright too!"

I had told Oug about the suspension and power-assist, but I made up the rest as I went along.

Translation:

Thor seemed to have noticed the air conditioning, while Alice appeared to have just noticed the lighting.

"How many magic stones did you use for that carriage?" asked Thor.

"Well, um... How many was it?" I replied.

"Ugh... If you were to sell it, I can't even imagine the price it would fetch."

As I counted the number of magic stones installed, Oug sighed and made that comment.

"Don't worry; I won't sell it."

"Of course! After all, you've already acknowledged the suspension and bearings since you're not taking jobs away from existing carriage companies. If you were to sell something like that, who knows how many companies would go bankrupt?"

"No, that's why I installed it for my personal use."

"Really... You didn't install anything else besides the lighting and refrigerator, as well as temperature control, right?"

Despite it being for personal use to prevent people from losing their jobs, Oug was angry with me. Why? He also asked if I had installed anything else.

"Well, now that you mention it..."

"What? What did you install?"

As I recalled various things, I remembered that I had added something that was the highlight of this occasion. Oug was exceptionally interested in it.

"Levitation magic..."

"Hey, come on!"

"We've arrived, you two."

I was about to explain the levitation magic, which I had added for emergency escape when the carriage got stuck in ruts. But just as I started, Oug enthusiastically interjected.

However, we had just arrived at the conference room, so Thor signaled me to stop.

"Well, I suppose it can't be helped. Shin, I'll listen to your explanation about that later, alright?"

"Huh? It's for emergency use!"

"Really? I'll definitely confirm it later, so be ready."

For now, they prioritized reporting and discussions over further inquiries. So, it was just for emergency escape.

The soldier standing in front of the conference room spoke to those inside and received their consent, so he opened the door. Inside, there were Uncle Dis, Dominic from the military bureau, and Looper, the head of the Magician's Corps.

"You're back, August. We've received preliminary reports from the communication troops, but it seems to be quite a situation."

Translation:

"Yes. A month from now, we were forced to participate in a game where the fate of both sides is at stake. We couldn't avoid this situation, and we apologize," I explained.

Before we even reported it, it seemed that Uncle Dis had already received reports. Since it's been a while since they started using it, Arlside has become quite accustomed to operating the communication device.

Upon being informed by Uncle Dis that he had already received reports, Oug expressed his apology for not preventing this situation.

"No need for apologies. I heard it was all one-sided from Strom. More importantly, it's about what we should do in this situation."

Uncle Dis, after accepting Oug's apology, seemed to be troubled about how to proceed with this situation.

Given that there might be thousands of disaster-class monsters and even stronger demons, facing disaster-class monsters with our group is not an option, but leaving them alone is also not viable.

"This time, our Arlside forces almost got wiped out facing several dozen disaster-class monsters. If we have to deal with a force dozens of times larger..."

"...I can only feel despair."

When Oug pointed out that the forces of Arlside almost got wiped out even in this scenario, Uncle Dis voiced his despair and covered his face with his hands. The commanders from various countries who were present at the scene also remained silent in the face of the word "despair" coming from the mouth of King August of the mighty Arlside, their expressions heavy.

In such a hopeless situation, just as I was about to suggest that maybe I should do my best to help, someone spoke up.

"Excuse me, Your Majesty. May I speak?"

"What is it? Dominic?"

The person who spoke was Dominic, the head of the military bureau.

"Yes. At this point, he no longer speaks of the pride of a knight. So, there's something I'd like to ask of you, Mr. Wolford."

"Me?"

The head of the military bureau was asking me? I wondered what it could be.

"Mr. Wolford has already received the provision of magical equipment, which significantly increases mobility, called jet boots. He declined any further reliance on magical equipment, saying it would go against the pride of a knight."

"Magical equipment? Ah, you mean the vibration sword."

Dominic, who struggled to speak, was taken over by Uncle Dis.

Translation:

Jet boots and the vibration sword, I had been using them since the days when I lived deep in the mountains, so Uncle Dis was aware of them.

Or rather, I had also given a knife-type one to Uncle Dis.

"What's this, Your Majesty? A vibration sword?"

Observing Uncle Dis and Director Dominic, who were apparently in agreement, Chief Magician Looper asked what they were talking about.

Oh? I hadn't shown it to Looper, had I?

"Looper, have you not seen it? Shin has a sword that can easily cut through even disaster-class monsters and demons."

"Oh, yes. That sword that can cut with such ease. If it has that level of sharpness, it must be a remarkable weapon."

"It's not all that special. I have one too."

Looper, who didn't know that the sword was magical, seemed to think it was an extraordinary weapon.

Uncle Dis took a vibration knife from his pocket and showed it to Looper, saying, "Oh, Your Majesty has one too."

"Shall I take a look?"

While saying this, Looper received the vibration knife from Uncle Dis with great respect. Having received it, Looper quickly tried to praise the knife, but it was originally just a cheap knife with magic added, so there was nothing to praise.

He probably thought it was a magnificent item because it was owned by the king, so Looper desperately tried to compliment it, but...

"Is...um, how should I put it...that...yes! The luster!"

Seeing him like that, Uncle Dis chuckled and told him the truth. "It was originally a cheap knife, so there's no need to force praise."

"Oh, uh, I see. But, but, what do you mean by this knife being the same as what Mr. Wolford has?"

The cheap knife that could be bought anywhere and the sword I mentioned earlier didn't seem to connect in Looper's mind.

"Earlier, Dominic said that he wouldn't approve of relying on magical equipment. That's magical equipment."

"A blade magical tool... However, Mr. Wolford's sword doesn't seem to shine or get hot..."

Increasingly confused by the term "magical equipment," Looper asked, "In the meantime, try flowing your magic through it," as instructed by Uncle Dis.

"Yes." Looper flowed magic into the knife as directed by Uncle Dis.

Translation:

"What... is this?"

Upon that, Looper seemed surprised as the knife began to vibrate.

"Shin, is there something to cut?"

"Is this okay?"

"Why are you cutting logs with it?"

Responding to Uncle Dis's request, I took out a log that I always inexplicably had stored in a different dimension and handed it to Looper, who voiced his doubts.

"Try cutting this log with that knife."

"Huh? A log with a knife?"

"Just give it a try."

"Yes..."

Looper was perplexed by Uncle Dis's request to cut a log. Typically, logs are cut with saws or axes, so it's understandable that Looper was confused.

Despite thinking that it was impossible to cut, Looper reluctantly placed the knife against the log due to the king's command.

Then...

"What?! What is this?"

"Surprised, aren't you?"

"I was surprised the first time I saw it too."

From his tone, it seemed like Director Dominic also knew about the vibration sword.

Maybe he saw it when Chris was showing it off.

"The knife itself is an ordinary, run-of-the-mill knife. However, the magic it's been imbued with is anything but ordinary. Well, I have no idea about the specifics, though."

With the knife that cut through the log as easily as tofu in hand, Looper stared in amazement, and the commanders from various countries were equally astonished by this sight.

Ignoring them, Director Dominic continued the request he had mentioned earlier, looking at me.

"We'd like to have this enchantment applied to our knights' swords as well."

After saying this, Director Dominic looked somewhat sad.

Honestly, I had never wanted to rely solely on this sword... But now, there's no time to be fixated on such a small sense of pride. If I continued to be fixated on such things, the world would be destroyed. Please... I'm begging you."

After saying this, Director Dominic placed his hands on the table and bowed deeply.

"Hey, stop it, Director Dominic!"

"Shin, I'm asking you too."

"Even you, Uncle Dis?"

In a highly unusual situation where the king of the great nation of Arsheid and the Director of Military Affairs were all bowing, the commanders of various countries were taken aback. However, for some reason, they also bowed to me.

"Mr. Wolford, please, bestow this enchantment on our swords!"

Translation:

"Please! That's what we're asking!"

"Shin, if you can enchant them, can you also do it for our halberds? Please, bestow it on our halberds too!"

This scene where grown adults, and high-ranking ones at that, were bowing to me left me completely bewildered.

"Alright! Alright, so please raise your heads!"

"I see! Then..."

"Oh, but..."

"What's the matter, Shin? Is there something bothering you?"

I held back Uncle Dis, who was eager to request the enchantment right away, and shared something I felt needed to be said.

"After this battle is over, I'll either collect all of them or remove the enchantments. So, I'm asking for strict management. Otherwise..."

"Otherwise?"

"...I'll be killed by my granny..."

"Everyone heard that!! Thoroughly manage the swords that Shin has enchanted!! Got it? Absolutely!!"

"Yes, sir!"

Having heard my words, Uncle Dis, with an intense expression, demanded strict management from Director Dominic and the commanders of various countries.

In response to his intense expression, everyone looked perplexed.

"When you mention Shin's grandma, you mean Archbishop Merida, right? Saying she'd kill you is quite exaggerated..."

One of the commanders mentioned such a fantasy.

Don't they know anything about my granny?

"You guys probably only know Merida from books and plays... The reality is much harsher."

Among those who know the real granny, Uncle Dis, in particular, must have been deeply affected by her fearsomeness.

With a distant look, he spoke philosophically about the cruelty of reality.

Nevertheless, I don't know much about the fictional versions from books and plays, but are they really that idealized?

"Anyway, the real Archbishop Merida is a very strict person, especially when it comes to her grandson Shin's disadvantages."

"Is that so?"

At Uncle Dis's words, Garan gasped.

Perhaps it's hard for them to accept it because they only know the idealized versions from books and plays.

Moreover, it's understandable that they couldn't grasp the essence of my granny, who had spent a long time in seclusion with Grandpa.

In any case...

"Please, really ensure strict management. Exaggerating about being killed might sound dramatic, but just think about the kind of punishment..."

Just the thought of it sent shivers down my spine.

Translation:

"That even Mr. Walforde, considered a divine messenger, fears so much..."

"Is it really that terrifying?"

For those who still didn't seem to quite grasp it, let me give them a more straightforward example.

"It's like Grandpa is afraid of it."

"W-Wise One!?"

"I see! We promise to strictly manage it!"

While Granny was famous for her magical tools, Grandpa had always been synonymous with being the strongest. The notion of Grandpa being afraid seemed to resonate in the hearts of the commanders who had previously not quite understood. They all promised strict management.

"I see, that's a relief. Now it seems like there's some light at the end."

"Yes, Your Majesty. There's still the task of getting used to the actual Vibrationsword. However, with Mr. Walforde here, who uses the Vibrationsword, as well as Tony, they can practice under his guidance. It's only a matter of time before they master it."

"Ah, Tony is using it too."

"Oh, really! That's reassuring!"

"There's one more person."

Finally, Uncle Dis and Director Dominic saw a glimmer of resolution. When I mentioned that Tony could use it too, Maria chimed in that there was one more person.

Oh, come to think of it, I also gave one to Miranda.

"That's right, I gave one to Miranda. We've been together for a while, and she's become quite proficient with it."

I see, then maybe I'll ask Miranda for help.

She became the top-ranked student in her second year at the Knight Trainee Officer Academy this year. In my mind, the moment Miranda's mandatory participation in training was decided flashed.

Not as a trainee, but as an instructor.

Meanwhile, at the Aarlsheid Knight Trainee Officer Academy.

"Hackshon!"

"What's wrong, Miranda? Got a cold?"

"...Yeah, maybe. I'm feeling a bit chilly."

Miranda, who had received the Vibrationsword from Shin and spent her days engaged in demon hunting, was suddenly plagued by an unexplained chill.
