Watching the bird hidden among the tall grass in the forest a little distance away,

As the bird, which had been pecking at its food, stopped its actions and prepared to take flight, a magic power generated in the hand, creating a vacuum wave and directing it towards the bird.

The bird, in the midst of taking off, was defenseless against the vacuum wave and lost its head.

"Alright!"

Approaching the successfully caught bird, I dug a hole using magic. Then, holding the bird's legs, I dropped blood into the hole to bleed it.

It's crucial to bleed the caught prey immediately; otherwise, the meat becomes too bloody, and spilling blood might attract other beasts.

Although I can handle other creatures even if they gather, unnecessary killing is better avoided.

Once the bleeding was done, I stored the bird in a space created by magic, and since I had caught a sufficient amount, I headed back home.

By the way, I just turned five.

I was named "Shin" by the old man who rescued me, and for some reason, I was raised as his grandson, so I also inherited the old man's family name, "Wolford," becoming "Shin Wolford."

The old man's name is "Merlin Wolford."

The old man is quite knowledgeable about magic and taught me about it with great care. In his younger days, he seems to have been quite famous, and despite living deep in the forest, people often visit him.

These visitors range from well-dressed gentlemen to knights with impressive equipment and even clearly witch-like old ladies.

...I wonder who the old man really is.

Well, regardless of his past, he's a good-natured old man who is always around now.

He seems to enjoy teaching me magic, and when I can use the magic he taught me, he praises me greatly. Even when I bring back game from the forest to use as food, he's full of compliments.

That makes me happy, so I'm doing my best at both magic and hunting. Well, the truth is, it's a lot of fun.

Even though I'm being taught magic... in this world, there are no incantations or spell names for magic.

Magic is all about "imagination."

The phenomenon you imagine becomes magic just as you picture it.

However, it seems that it's difficult to form that "imagination." Typically, when learning magic, people often use incantations to help materialize their imagination, even when they use magic in front of them.

So, it seems that most people end up using similar types of magic.

That's the reason I mentioned "basically." You can use magic without it, but it makes it easier.

As for me, I originally come from a world where subcultures were abundant, and I have a creativity that goes in a completely different direction from this world. Imagining magic from anime and manga is easy for me, so I've never used incantations before.

So, what am I being taught? I'm learning to control magical power.

No matter how vivid your imagination is, if magic were to activate just like that, the world would descend into chaos.

To use magic, you need magical power. Magical power exists everywhere in this world, but not many people can control it.

Well, in a world where magical power is ever-present, everyone unconsciously uses magical power when they move their bodies. In fact, not being able to use magical power would hinder your vital functions. So, creating a small spark or producing drinking water is something anyone can do.

However, as I mentioned earlier, it's impossible to release vacuum waves like I did without advanced magical power control.

In other words, if you don't have enough magical power, which serves as fuel for your imagination, the magic won't activate.

So, I train with the old man every day to control magical power and learn what I can and cannot do with magic. I'm also being taught existing spells to check my abilities.

And, with that, I arrived at home. Our house is entirely made of wood and, in terms of layout, it's like a three-bedroom apartment, I guess?

In the kitchen, there's a sink without a faucet, a stove that ignites with magical power, a dining area, and a six-seater table.

The living room has an L-shaped arrangement of sofas, with a four-seater and a two-seater, a table, and a fireplace. Since it's not practical to use magical power to light the fireplace all the time, it's the type that burns wood.

There are also my room, the old man's room, and the old man's study.

By the way, there is no second floor; it's a single-story house.

"Grandpa, I'm home."

I say this as I enter the house.

"Oh, welcome back."

"You're not a bother at all."

I reply to the old man, who has a guest over today. By the way, the guest is the knight-like gentleman with the impressive equipment I mentioned earlier.

"Welcome, Mr. Michel."

This gentleman is called Michel Colling. He has short, blond hair, green eyes, and a well-kept face that must have made him quite popular when he was younger. He's not a bodybuilder, but he has a sturdy, muscular physique, not too lean.

I don't know what he does for a living.

He occasionally visits the old man and teaches me martial arts other than magic, such as swordsmanship, spear techniques, and archery.

Although the old man has some proficiency in martial arts, his main focus is on magic, and he can't match Michel in martial skills.

"Ah, what did you manage to hunt today?" the old man asks about today's hunting results.

"Today, I got some hollow birds and forest rabbits."

...Sorry for the difficult-to-read language. There's no language cheat like in those reincarnation or summoning stories, and I'm only five years old, so my pronunciation is not perfect.

"I see, the forest rabbits are one thing, but you managed to hunt hollow birds?"

Uh-oh, I better explain before it becomes a big problem.

"I used a knife for the forest rabbits, but I used magic for the hollow birds."

Phew, that was close. Hollow birds are very cautious and not easy to hunt, even for skilled hunters. Furthermore, their meat is incredibly delicious, making them a highly valuable game.

If it seemed like I took them down with a knife or bow and arrow, it would have raised the level of my martial arts training.

I love practicing magic because it's fun, but I'm not very fond of martial arts training as it's tough and tiring.

"Hmm, don't be so modest. Killing a hollow bird with magic means you have the ability to conceal your presence from highly vigilant opponents and strike swiftly in an instant. It seems we can make your training a bit more rigorous."

No way, I can't avoid it, can I?

I looked at the old man with desperation. Please, help me, old man. Your grandson is in trouble!

"Haha, don't worry, I'll take it easy on you."

There was no ally in this house.
