"After that, I sent Sicily back to her family's home."

"Is that so!"

"It seems that doing such things before getting married is not unusual for nobility, but Sicily and doing it right away felt somewhat different. I think it's better to continue dating as a couple a little longer, let your feelings for each other grow."

With that in mind, I went to pick up Sicily and Maria, whom I had sent back to their families, and waited for everyone at my house.

"By the way, Grandfather, Grandmother."

"Hmm? What is it?"

"Is there something wrong?"

"While we were traveling around various countries and attending meetings for setting up gates and joining the alliance... or was it the other way around? During that time, you are welcome to use Claude's mansion in the city as you please."

"Huh? Is that okay?"

"Yes. Since Shin and I... have become engaged, and you, Grandfather and Grandmother, are becoming family, it's only natural."

"Is that fine? Claude's city has a nice hot spring, so if that's the case, I won't hesitate to use it."

"Yes. I've informed the staff as well. They were all delighted to be of service to Hero-sama."

"In that case, I'll at least make use of the hot spring. I can't stay there all the time since we have our own staff, but..."

"Yes! Please do!"

"So, Merlin, I'm counting on you."

"I'm not a shared carriage, you know..."

Is this a common concern for people who can use gates?

Grandpa had some doubts about being used as transportation for Grandma's feet, but he couldn't oppose her.

Grandpa, stay strong!

"Oh, and is it alright if some of our staff members accompany us? We need to show them some appreciation once in a while."

"Of course, that's fine."

"Is that acceptable, Lady Merida?"

Marieka, the head maid who was standing nearby, asked. I wonder if benefits for staff members are not very common?

"Sicily said it's fine, so there's no need to hold back. Besides, we're grateful to all of you, so once in a while, you should take a break and enjoy the hot spring."

"Very well, then. We appreciate your kind words. Thank you, Lady Merida."

"Oh, Lady Merida..."

Everyone nodded in agreement with Alice's words. They hadn't been to a regular magic tool shop since their initial visit to the royal capital, so they were unaware of the magic tool situation in other households.

"This house also has plenty of magic tools we've never seen."

"The bathroom was a revelation. After that, our home's bathroom just didn't cut it."

"I understand!"

"That was truly remarkable. Are there any plans to sell it? If so, we should replace all the toilets in our inn with that."

What they were talking about were toilets with a warm water cleaning function.

It was amusing to see everyone's reaction when it was demonstrated to them.

"Oh, Shin. About that toilet, Tom said he wants to sell it when he starts that trading company. What do you think?"

"So, what happened to that trading company in the end?"

"Shin will represent it, but the actual management will be entrusted to Sicily's older brother, Royce, and Alice's father."

"Wow, it's all relatives."

"It's better to start something like this with family. You can trust them. If the business expands, you can always hire new employees."

"Ah! I heard about that! My dad was so happy because his salary would increase a lot!"

"Huh... I had no idea."

"Shin, you have things to do other than making money, right? You don't have to do everything on your own."

Since he was an employee in his past life, Shin didn't understand much about running a business.

"Utilizing people's strengths."

"That's right. You need to work hard for the sake of humanity."

"Got it, Grandma."

"That aside, what about the toilet?"

"Ah, I told Uncle Tom that it's fine."

"I see. Hey, Merlin, do you have anything to add?"

"Oh... I've already been told everything..."

"Gramps, I understand your feelings!"

"That's right. Shin will become humanity's hope. Do your best."

"Thank you, Gramps. Well then, Oug, shall we go for the negotiations on utilizing your strengths?"

"Yeah, May, I'm counting on you."

"Shin, it's not a problem with you around!"

"All right, then, Ultimate Magicians, let's depart."

"Yes!"

"It's a business trip, too."

"Don't say things that spoil the atmosphere."

With that, they took off from the Arsheid royal capital.

"Wow! It feels great!"

"May, you seem a bit wobbly. Do you want me to stabilize it a bit?"

"Like this?"

"You're quite good, Princess May."

"Hehe!"

"They seem to be having fun over there."

"What's the matter, Ellie? Aren't you having fun?"

"It's not that, but... I feel bad being the only one carried by Lord August, and it's kind of embarrassing."

Since the audio bypass was connected, Shin could hear the conversation between Oug and Ellie.

Although Shin was the one nullifying gravity for everyone with anti-gravity, the team members each used their own wind magic to move through the air.

Ellie couldn't use the wind magic, so Oug was carrying her in what some might call a princess carry.

Since gravity was nullified, it would be fine to just hold hands. However, it seemed that Oug preferred carrying her that way.

Shin didn't say anything, as it would be tactless.

This time, they were visiting three countries.

The Swed Kingdom was on the south side of the Empire, sharing its eastern border with Arsheid. To the east of the Swed Kingdom, it bordered the southeastern part of the Empire, which was the Dam Kingdom. To the north of that, it bordered the eastern side of the Empire, which was the Carnan Kingdom, and to the north of that, it bordered the northeastern part of the Empire, which was the Kurt Kingdom.

The northern side of the Empire was adjacent to the sea.

This time, they would pass through the Swed Kingdom first and head to the Dam Kingdom, then proceed to the other countries one by one.

They had visited the Swed Kingdom recently, and there was still reconstruction work due to the damage caused by the demons. Therefore, they couldn't afford to make a stop for sightseeing.

Last time, they had passed through the border because they received a request for assistance, but this time, they had decided to follow the proper procedures to cross the border.

They presented their citizen IDs to cross the border with the Swed Kingdom and entered the Dam Kingdom.

"Your Highness, may I ask a question, albeit a bit late?"

"What is it, Corna?"

During their walk toward the capital of the Dam Kingdom after crossing the border, Alice asked Oug a question.

"Aren't the demons not that strong, to be honest? It seems like we could take them down even without us..."

Alice's question was quite valid.

To be honest, they were more than capable of defeating the demons by themselves.

But Oug didn't choose to do that.

"That's right. First and foremost, we don't know where the demons will appear, so we want to establish a situation where we can counter them by cooperating with other major nations, including Arsheid."

"But you provided the communication device for that purpose, and you're currently on your way to be able to rush to their aid if called, right?"

In response to Alice's question, Maria also had a question. It seems like many of them have doubts about this mission.

"That's right. Honestly, we might be the only ones capable of countering the demons."

"Then why?"

"If we continue as we are, Arsheid will win too much."

"Win too much."

Suppose that the organization formed by just the advanced magic academy students of Arsheid defeated the demons. The scale of the achievement in saving the world might be so immense that other major nations could become envious or feel threatened. In that case, conflicts among humans might arise.

Therefore, they needed to make sure that other major nations had the fact that they also fought against the demons, so they wouldn't think that they alone had saved the world. If they could defeat some demons, that would be enough. Even if they couldn't defeat them, preventing demon attacks would still be considered an achievement.

"...So, is the union being formed to reward Arsheid because other countries don't want Arsheid to monopolize the glory?"

"First and foremost, it's to protect each nation and the world. Don't get it mixed up. But if Arsheid were to do it all alone, there's a chance it could become a source of conflict after everything is settled."

"Even though it's a crisis for all of humanity! Why would they be envious?"

"That's what nations and humans are like."

No matter what, there would always be those who envied, even when it was a crisis for all of humanity. It's quite a hassle.

After hearing Oug's explanation, everyone was indignant.

"What's wrong, Shin? I thought you would be like, 'What the heck is that!?'"

"Well... I had some expectations to a certain extent."

"Oh? What do you mean?"

"Most likely, we could defeat the demons by ourselves. We could, but... I was thinking about how the neighboring countries that are living in fear of demon attacks would be thankful, but how would the other countries without a direct threat feel about it?"

"Hmm, you're quite insightful. I didn't expect you to think that far."

"That's true... even though Lord August explained it to me, I'm still having a hard time fully accepting it."

"I also understand it logically, but..."

"I, too, have reservations."

Thor and Julius, who had likely heard this kind of discussion while serving Oug, also had ambiguous expressions on their faces.

Honestly, I can't stand being accused of seeking recognition for saving humanity, but as long as that possibility exists, we can't ignore it.

"Well, I'll handle negotiations with Els and East, including that. We won't do anything harmful."

With Oug's words, they arrived in the capital of the Darm Kingdom.

"Welcome to the Darm Kingdom. May I see your citizen IDs?"

"Yes."

"I'll take a look...!?"

"Is everything in order? If possible, we'd like an audience after this."

"P-Please wait a moment!"

The soldier responsible for checking their citizen IDs, after seeing Oug's ID, withdrew to the back and returned with someone who appeared to be a superior officer.

"Welcome again. Please, this way."

With those words, they were led into a back area, including all of them.

"Once again, welcome. Your Highness August."

"Ah, I apologize for the trouble."

"No, it's just that if your identity as His Highness August were exposed there, it would cause various complications."

A very considerate person.

Because they were traveling incognito, if it became known that they were the Crown Prince of the Arsheid Kingdom, it would cause various complications.

"In that case, I'll send a messenger to the royal palace. Would you like to come and meet?"

"No, this time I'll meet alone. However, I'll take these two guards with me."

With those words, he pointed to Thor and Julius.

It seemed both of them had that in mind, as they nodded silently.

Honestly, Oug's combat abilities now surpassed those of these two. If someone were to harm Oug, they wouldn't know what level of skilled individuals they'd need to bring. However, aside from that, not having any guards or companions as the Crown Prince of a nation might lead to being underestimated.

For that reason, he was taking guards with him.

...With the three of them, it seems like they could conquer the entire castle.

After waiting for a while in the guard post at the capital's gate, a messenger soldier returned with a welcoming carriage.

"Well then, I'll go. Do we need to decide on a meeting place?"

"There's no need to decide. You can locate our position with magic detection, can't you?"

"That's true. See you later."

"Yeah, I'll secure accommodations."

"I'll leave it to you."

With those words, Oug, along with Thor and Julius, got into the carriage and departed.

"Now, before Oug returns, let's choose our lodgings and explore the city."

"Hi! By the way, what kind of country is the Darm Kingdom?"

"I'm not sure."

"Shin, you really don't know much about the world, do you..."

"Ugh... I'm sorry..."

"Huh? Oh no! It's alright, Mei. She's still young and it's about foreign countries."

"Is that so?"

"Really?"

"That's right. They don't teach us much about foreign countries at the elementary academy. We learn about it at the middle academy."

"I... didn't go to either the elementary or middle academy..."

"Oh... I'm sorry..."

"No, it's okay. So, what kind of country is the Darm Kingdom?"

Let's move the conversation forward since my past feels a bit lonely. Yeah.

"The Darm Kingdom is a small but historically significant country. It used to be the headquarters of the Creation Religion, back before the Holy Land of East was established."

"I see, is that so?"

"After the Holy Land of East was established, and the Creation Religion started governing the country, the headquarters moved there. But even now, the old cathedral and other historical sites from that time are preserved and serve as tourist attractions."

"Wow, I didn't know that!"

"Yes, and Saint East, a martyr of the Creation Religion, was born in this country. His birthplace should be open to the public."

"I'd love to visit there!"

"Great, after we secure our lodgings, we can visit Saint East's birthplace, the church, and other places of interest."

"Okay!"

For now, their plans for activities in Darm are set.

The cathedral in Darm...

Let's stop there! It feels dangerous to go any further.

First, they need to find accommodations.

They prioritized safety over price and secured a lodging near the center of the capital. Two rooms, one for males and one for females.

Afterward, since they had an extra-dimensional storage, they didn't have any luggage to leave behind, so they ventured into the city of Darm.

As expected, with the former headquarters of the Creation Religion located here, there were churches all over the city, and the atmosphere was characterized by gentle people.

"But seriously, the former headquarters, and you didn't know?"

"I never really heard about religion back at home."

"Huh? Is that so?"

"Yeah, my grandmother was a pragmatist, and she believed in taking care of things on your own rather than relying on God. As for my grandfather..."

"What about Merlin-sama?"

"I heard that my grandmother once said something like 'God is for the weak!'..."

"...You probably shouldn't say that in this country."

"Yeah, you're right. Let's not."

So, that's why I first learned about the Holy Land of East during my magical academy classes.

"Because of my family. I didn't even know there was such a thing as religion."

"Huh, so... what about weddings?"

Sicily asked with a worried look.

"Don't they hold them in a church?"

"R-right, of course! We'll have it in a church! No problem!"

"Do they hold them anywhere else? I heard that the Creation Religion's priestesses handle all ceremonies, but..."

"No, it's fine! We'll have it in a church, no issue!"

"Is that so?"

By the way, in the Creation Religion, all clergy are generally referred to as "miko," as they are considered the children of the Creator God, either as sons or daughters.

Well, I've heard that within the Creation Religion, there are also titles like bishop or cardinal.

Amid the conversation, they arrived at Saint East's birthplace.

"So this is... Saint East's birthplace..."

All the pure Creation Religion believers looked at the house in awe. However...

"It's surprisingly underwhelming!"

"Hey! Mei-chan, even if you think that, you shouldn't say it out loud."

"Oh, I'm sorry..."

"Come on... Could you not ruin the moment?"

"Yeah, you're spoiling the atmosphere."

"Sorry..."

But it really is quite underwhelming. Well, that's what you'd expect from a birthplace. In my previous life, I'd seen a famous person's birthplace on TV, and it wasn't much different.

Saint East's birthplace had been turned into a museum, with various items related to Saint East on display.

Well, they were mostly everyday items, though. It was his family home, after all.

After quickly touring the modest birthplace, they decided to visit a church next.

There are several famous churches in the area, but for tourism's sake, they opted for the old headquarters, Darm Cathedral.

As they approached the cathedral, more and more people appeared.

It's bustling with people, as expected of a tourist spot.

"That's strange. Last time I came, there weren't so many people."

"Huh, really? Then why is it so crowded now?"

"I have no idea."

"Oh, there it is!"

Olivia pointed in the direction of a massive cathedral. The area around it was teeming with even more people.

"Wow, it's really amazing!"

"Wait, there are way too many people here. What's going on?"

When Maria sighed like that...

Dong... Dong... Dong...

The bells of the cathedral rang out. The doors of the cathedral opened, and the just-married bride and groom emerged.

"Wow! Is this it? The cause of the congestion!"

"Having a wedding ceremony in the cathedral... It must be some noble's. It's not something that happens often."

"So they just happened to visit on the day of the ceremony."

"How lovely... I wish I could have a wedding like this..."

"Mark, do your best."

"Don't say such unreasonable things, Lynn! It's financially and socially impossible!"

The women were entranced by the scene, while Olivia expressed her desire to have her wedding here. Mark, on the other hand, grew anxious.

"By the way, where are Ellie and Aug going to have their wedding?"

"That's already decided; it will be at the Aarhus Cathedral in Arl'sheid."

It seems that their wedding is set to take place in a cathedral located in Arl'sheid.

"Having a royal wedding at that location is a tradition. It's a wonderful and fitting church for it."

"The cathedral in the capital is said to be just as incredible. I've never been there, though."

"It's magnificent! It's on par with Darm Cathedral. However, due to differences in historical backgrounds, it hasn't become a tourist attraction like this."

When we get back to the capital, maybe we should go see it.

Sicily, on the other hand, looked at me while we were arm in arm, and she gazed at the wedding ceremony with a dreamy expression. I wonder if she admires grand ceremonies like this?

"Sicily, do you want to have a wedding in a place like this?"

"Huh? No, that's... well, I guess I still admire it, or rather, I'm envious..."

"I see... So how about we have a wedding like this when we save the world?"

"S-Shin..."

Oops, that line had quite an effect. She hugged me tightly and seemed deeply moved.

While stroking Sicily's head, I watched the wedding ceremony and once again pledged to save the world.

"Tch... Why do the lovey-dovey couples have to say stuff like that?"

"I wish someone would say that to me too!"

"We'll have to find the right person before thinking about the location."

Sigh

I could hear sighs from the single ladies... It's okay, probably...
