trip
to explore the nightlife scene in Bangkok

"Amazing... They disappeared in the blink of an eye," Xiao Lin muttered after Shin and the others took off.

"Well, I've been flying through the sky for about three years now. I can maintain a decent speed," Xiao Lin continued.

"If we fly too fast, it gets hard to breathe, but I've also become skilled at wind magic to prevent that," she added.

Mark and Olivia spoke to Xiao Lin, who was still staring at the direction where Shin and the others had flown off.

"If we could fly the airship at a similar speed..."

Xiao Lin started to say that they might have arrived sooner, but her words were negated by Mark.

"If we flew at the same speed as us, the airship would fall apart," he said.

"Is that so?"

"Yes. If we flew at the same speed as us, the airship would need a metal body."

"Metal... So that means..."

"It would become incredibly heavy, and the required magical power to keep it afloat would be enormous. In that case, no matter how many pilots we have, it wouldn't be enough."

"Things don't always go as smoothly as we'd like, do they?"

Xiao Lin quickly revised her thoughts after Mark's explanation.

"Well, that's where a craftsman's skills come into play. But... I don't really know how to improve what Walford makes. His magical tools deviate too much from common sense, and I don't know how to make them better," Mark said.

"That's... really something," Xiao Lin responded.

"You mentioned this at the desert camp, didn't you? Honestly, I believe Walford has memories of the previous civilization," Mark said.

"Memories of the previous civilization..."

Upon hearing that, Xiao Lin fell silent.

Mark interpreted Xiao Lin's reaction as a sign that she still couldn't quite believe it, and he didn't dwell on it.

So he left the silent Xiao Lin and spoke to Navarre.

"Shall we go soon?"

"Yes, indeed. It's about time. Well then, Xiao Lin, shall we go?"

"Huh? Oh, yes!"

Xiao Lin, who was addressed by Navarre, quickly raised her head.

She then boarded the carriage prepared by the Min family along with the diplomatic mission.

Mark and Olivia were acting as guards, so they traveled on foot.

The delegation continued walking towards the Yu Emperor's Palace, but the atmosphere in the capital along the way appeared to be on the brink of panic.

The information people were discussing had evolved from the news that the village Mark and others had heard about being attacked to something that had already spread throughout Kwang Long. The discussions seemed confused, and it was clear that things were in disarray.

"It feels like complete chaos," Mark remarked.

"Yeah. Are they really going to hold a meeting in such a situation?" Olivia wondered.

"Who knows? Complicated matters like that are within the domain of His Highness and Navarre-san. We should focus on our own duties," Mark replied.

"Right."

Mark and Olivia deployed their reconnaissance magic once again to survey the surroundings. As a result, there was no sign of suspicious magic, just like in the past few days.

"Really, it's been remarkably quiet since the first day," Mark noted.

"Well, this is normal for a diplomatic mission," Olivia commented.

While discussing this, they continued walking towards the Yu Emperor's Palace and eventually arrived.

"At least there was nothing on the way."

"During our journey, that is. But..."

While saying this, Olivia looked inside the buildings.

Inside, the scene was also one of great confusion, with many people running around.

Shao Lin, who had gotten off the carriage, grabbed one of the bureaucrats running around and tried to speak with them. However, the bureaucrat shouted something and rushed away without responding.

"I wonder what they said?" Mark wondered, and Shao Lin soon provided the answer.

"I asked where today's meeting would be held, but they told me there's no time for a meeting in this crisis, and Hao is being held responsible for this chaos, so there won't be any meeting," Shao Lin explained.

Mark, Navarre, and everyone else nodded in agreement with Shao Lin's words.

"That makes sense. With the country in such turmoil, there's no time for negotiations with other nations," Navarre concurred.

"But it means our trip was in vain," Mark added.

Navarre chuckled and shook his head, "Not necessarily. At the very least, we've learned that this country isn't entirely corrupt."

"What do you mean?" Olivia asked, puzzled.

Honestly, I thought Hao held immense power in this country, but it seems not. This situation was triggered by legislation Hao promoted, and it's clear that there are forces capable of investigating it. That alone is a valuable insight," Navarre explained.

Mark and Olivia agreed with Navarre's words. Indeed, Shao Lin had mentioned earlier that Hao was being held responsible for the chaos.

This meant that there were power figures in the country other than Hao. Up until now, Mark had thought that the entire country might be corrupt based on Kwang Long's actions. But it seemed that there were still some decent individuals left.

"There's no point in staying here any longer. Once we've recorded our visit, shall we head back?" Navarre suggested.

"Understood. I'll inform them of that," Shao Lin replied.

Shao Lin recorded the time of their visit with the person responsible for managing the entrance to the Yu Emperor's Palace, leaving evidence, and the group left the palace.

Navarre, sitting in the carriage, muttered to himself as he watched the Yu Emperor's Palace receding in the distance, "It would be a windfall if Hao were to lose his position."

Shao Lin, who was sitting across from him, heard his mutter and responded, "It may be inappropriate during these trying times, but I would be happy if that happened."

Navarre grinned and nodded, "People like him have a knack for surviving."

Shao Lin agreed with Navarre's statement but wore a somewhat gloomy expression.

That was because she had a particular concern related to the rumors surrounding Hao.

If those rumors were true, there was a possibility that Hao's position might be secured. The rumor in question was that Hao had unearthed powerful ancient weaponry through unique archaeological excavations. If Hao had indeed acquired such powerful weapons, it could potentially resolve the current situation.

These ancient weapons were truly formidable.

In hindsight, Shao Lin regretted not discussing this with Shin and the others. In the short time they had spent with Shin and his group, they hadn't been able to grasp their true nature, so she had avoided bringing up dangerous topics. But once it was clear that Shin was a trustworthy person, she should have mentioned it.

During the journey back in the carriage, Shao Lin was tormented by worry that this situation might take a turn for the worse.
