"Hahaha! Did you get misunderstood with that magical tool?"

"It's not a laughing matter, Dad... Thanks to that, everyone's giving me cold looks."

After that, the misunderstanding couldn't be cleared up, and the women continued to give him cold looks.

It was a misunderstanding, but the effect was certainly there, so nothing he said could change that. Still, as a magical tool, everyone kept it on.

"Hahaha! Well, unintended effects and uses are quite common in creations. Don't worry too much."

"In my case, it's misunderstood the other way around..."

"Don't get too down. See, the communication device is ready."

"Thank you, Dad!"

Why did he visit the Bean Workshop again today, just a few days after his last visit? It was because today was the day the prototype wireless communication device would be completed.

"Now, let's start by applying this..."

The received communication device had a large transceiver-like shape with a dial that could be set from zero to twelve, similar to a safe. Set the number on the dial, start communication with the communication button, and end the call with the communication termination button. Inside, it had a kind of circuit board, which allowed for multiple components to be used, each with its own application.

When he proposed this to his father, he was deeply impressed. But in any case, they set the magic stones and decided to test it immediately.

"Let me try the first one, and you take the second, Dad."

"Got it!"

"Alright, I'll send a call to the second one."

They initiated the call, but there was no response.

"Huh? Did it fail?"

"Hmm? Oh! Incoming call tone!"

"Incoming call tone?"

"It's the sound that indicates the connection has been established."

"I see, it's not very clear this way, is it?"

"The incoming call tone... for now, let's say 'Hello?'"

"Oh! I heard a voice! 'Hey, can you hear me?'"

"Oh, I can hear you. I'll step away for a moment."

Since he could hear his father's voice from the wireless communication device, he went outside the workshop.

"Dad, can you hear me?"

"Yeah, I can hear you perfectly!"

"Is the other communication device working? Can you hear the conversation?"

"No, only this communication device. It can specify the numbers correctly."

"That's good. Let's move on then."

With that, he pressed the communication termination button on the communication device, selected the zero number for an open line, and pressed the communication button.

"Hello, can you hear me? Is the voice coming from the entire communication device?"

"Oh!? I heard voices simultaneously from the communication device!"

"That's good; this one is a success too."

"Heh... I created it myself, but it turned out to be quite impressive."

"Haha... Now, the question is how far it can transmit."

"Well, that's fine, but please change the numbers; it's too noisy."

Oh, it was still on an open line. His father was probably hearing his voice from the communication device.

"I'm sorry. I'll hang up for a moment and call you on the second line."

"Alright."

He pressed the communication termination button again, dialed to the second line, and pressed the communication button.

"Dad, can you hear me?"

"Yeah, I can hear you. But you know, we need a sound to indicate when the connection is established."

"True... that's an area for improvement."

"Well, I'll think about it on my end too. So, how about testing the distance?"

"Yes, please."

With that, he temporarily ended the communication and went to his home through a gate.

"Oh, welcome back, Shin. Are you done with your business at the workshop?"

"No, I'm actually in the middle of an experiment."

"An experiment?"

"Yes, Dad, can you hear me?"

"Oh, I can hear you. Where are you now?"

"I'm at my house."

"Shin's house? Ah, that gate Mark told me about the other day."

"Yes."

"Just wait for a moment! Wh-what is that?"

For now, when he confirmed that the distance was fine, he heard a voice from his grandmother.

"Is this... a wireless communication device?"

"Uh, Grandma...!"

His grandmother fell silent at the mention of a wireless communication device. She had heard about enchanted communication devices even with wired connections, so wireless must have been quite shocking.

"A-Are you... making such incredible things again?"

"Well, I made it, but I'm not planning to release it to the public yet. I've been told that the priority is to spread wired communication devices in Augsburg."

"Are you planning to release it eventually?"

"It's convenient, you know?"

"Too convenient!"

"It's just a prototype for now, so we'll need to make improvements in the future."

"Really... this child is truly..."

His grandmother muttered as if giving up on something.

But let's get back to the testing.

"I'm sorry, Dad. I'm back."

"O-Oh, is it really okay? Master, are you angry?"

"Hahaha, Grandma is always like this."

"Whose fault is that? Whose!?"

"Is it really okay?"

"It's fine. So, I'll go a little farther this time."

"Alright."

He ended the communication for a moment and informed Cecily.

"So, I'm going to test the communication device now. When I get back, I'll have Cecily test it too."

"Yes."

"Alright, see you later."

"Yes. Oh, wait a moment."

"Hmm?"

"Your collar..."

It seemed that his collar was askew. Cecily adjusted it, nodded, and said, "Okay, it's fine now."

"Yes, it's okay. Have a safe trip."

"Yeah... it feels nice, like a married couple."

"Huh... Hehe, well then... have a safe trip, my dear."

Oops... I'm filled with happiness.

"...Have a safe trip kiss..."

"Ah..."

"Go quickly! You fool!"

Due to his grandmother's intense scolding, there was no "safe trip kiss."

Damn...

Next, he visited the house in the forest. His grandmother's barrier magic tool was still functioning as usual.

This place was a few hours away by carriage. Perhaps he extended the testing distance too much at once.

Anyway, he started the communication device.

"Dad, can you hear me?"

"Yeah, I can hear you. Where are you now?"

"I can reach here, too... I'm a few hours away by carriage."

"A few hours by carriage!? Can it still reach!?"

"It seems so... I wonder how far it can reach."

"You're testing that, right?"

"That's right. I'll go to the next place."

"Alright."

Now, where should he go next? Somewhere farther away...

And so, the next place he visited was the Kingdom of Suede, the country where the Trilateral Summit was held. He had been thinking about visiting through a gate, so he decided to do it while he was at it.

"Dad, can you hear me?"

"Yeah, I can hear you."

"...It reaches here too."

"Huh? How far have you gone?"

"The Kingdom of Suede."

"S..."

As expected, he was at a loss for words. He only added voice transmission, yet it reached this far... How far can it go, really?

"In this case, I'd like to investigate thoroughly."

"That's right. So, where should we go next?"

"Let's go in order. Next, I'll go to the Kingdom of Darm."

"Got it. I'll be waiting."

He then went to the Kingdom of Darm through a gate and activated the communication device.

"It's amazing... it's still connected..."

He tested it in the Kingdom of Karnan and the Kingdom of Kurt in order...

"...I'm starting to get scared about how far this can reach."

"It's just a thought, but..."

"What is it?"

"As long as there's mana, it may stay connected..."

"...You mean it's transmitting mana?"

"Maybe... I haven't researched it, and I can't research it..."

In reality, he had only added voice transmission and reception that could specify numbers. With just that, he could achieve wireless communication. He didn't have any specialized knowledge about radio waves or the like, not even in his past life. So, the only thing that seemed possible was...

The wired communication devices transmitted mana through the threads of the giant spider, which was magically altered. So, could it be that voice transmission also transmitted mana? Not by emitting radio waves, but... It was just a hypothesis, and he couldn't say for sure. Perhaps he would understand if he went to the other side of this world. As far as he knew, radio waves couldn't reach the far side of a planet without relay satellites... If it reached without using relay satellites, it would likely indicate that mana was being transmitted. Anyway, that was something to investigate another day. It was incredibly intriguing, though...

"Well, Dad, I'll be back for now."

"Alright."

He returned to the Bean Workshop through a gate.

"Whoa! You're back from Kurt already!?"

"It's a kind of magic."

"I really can't keep up with all of this..."

"Haha, well, I'll take the communication device. I'll transfer the payment."

"It's a prototype, so it's fine..."

"Don't say it that casually. Well, we'll test it in various ways with everyone. If we come up with improvements, we'll ask for your help again."

"Yeah. I'll think about the incoming call tone on my end."

"Please do. Well then."

Saying that, he left the Bean Workshop and returned home.

"Welcome back, Shin."

"Welcome back."

"I'm back. I'll get right to it; this is Cecily's communication device."

"Oh, the one from earlier..."

"I want everyone to use it from now on and identify areas for improvement. Please cooperate."

"Yes. It's a bit nerve-wracking..."

"Haha, there's no need to be so nervous. To put it simply, it's just a tool for talking."

It's not like it can access the internet or send emails.

"But it's still amazing..."

"I wonder what this child's perspective is... whether something incredible according to Shin will come out eventually..."

"Incredible things according to Shin... like flying ships?"

"...He's already flying around using levitation magic, so he might create something like that eventually."

"Oh, hehe..."

Incredible things, huh... I think he could create airplanes if he wanted to. After all, anti-gravity-based levitation magic was a success. I believe he could create a safer mode of transportation than the airplanes in my previous life. Ideally, you would need wings with the right curvature and angles to generate lift, but I have no knowledge of that at all. By bestowing anti-gravity magic, you could create vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Should I give it a try?

"Shin!"

"What is it, Grandma?"

"You... you were trying to create something incredible, weren't you?"

"Huh? Did I say that out loud?"

"It was written all over your face! But still! Were you trying to create something?"

"What a leading question!"

"Um... Shin, it's pretty obvious..."

I've been told this before. Do I really wear my emotions so plainly on my face?

"You know, when you think of something, you get a mischievous grin!"

"No way!?"

"It's true..."

Seriously... and everyone sees through it right away.

"Alright. I'll be more careful."

"I don't mean that! I mean, restrain yourself from thinking up such outrageous things!"

"Huh?"

For everyone to notice until I'm questioned...

"That's impossible!"

"It's not impossible! Why do you and Merlin, for that matter, always try to put your ideas into action immediately!?"

"They said we're not blood-related, but... we really do seem like a true grandpa and grandson, don't we?"

"Well..."

"Hoho, you're blushing."

"I'm not being praised!"

Being called a true grandfather and grandson, he felt a bit happy, but Grandma scolded him.

"If you get so angry, your blood vessels might burst?"

Oh, Grandma started trembling.

"Whose fault is it? Whose?"

It was the loudest outburst they'd had so far.

Strange...

More importantly, it seems like making an airplane will have to wait. First, a car... or maybe a motorcycle? But if he creates a self-propelled vehicle, it might cause trouble for the shared horse carriage industry and horse breeders...

Hmm...

Ah, more importantly, he should create suspensions for the horse carriages first. He'll need dampers first, or both four-wheeled and two-wheeled carriages won't work. Can he make do with springs alone? Or should he create oil dampers? What was the structure of oil dampers again? He's pretty sure he made one when building a remote-controlled car...

"You're plotting something again, aren't you!?"

"I got caught again!?"

"Cut it out already!"

Amid these somewhat everyday exchanges, he escorted Cecily to her home. As they were about to sleep, a thought suddenly crossed his mind.

"Cecily, can you hear me?"

"Hya! Huh? Shin?"

"Yeah, it's the communication device."

"Oh, this, right. I got surprised."

"Looks like we do need an incoming call tone."

"Incoming call tone?"

"A sound that lets you know the call is connected."

"Oh, right. It's useful to have one."

"Well, that's already been raised as an issue. By the way, are you in your room now?"

"Yes. I was thinking of going to sleep soon."

"I see. I'm about to do the same."

"By the way, what's up?"

"Well... I wanted to hear your voice before going to sleep..."

"R-really...? That makes me happy. Hearing your voice at the end of the day..."

"I see..."

"Yes..."

Wow, it's so embarrassing to be the one to initiate this! But those words make me incredibly happy.

"Okay, well, just one more thing."

"What is it?"

"Goodnight, Cecily."

"Yes! Goodnight, Shin."

After saying that, he ended the communication.

This is nice; it might become a habit.

Wrapped in the happiness of exchanging words with Cecily before going to bed, I fell asleep that day.

"Good morning, everyone."

"Good morning, everyone."

"Yeah, good morning."

"Good morning!"

"Today, it's the school uniform."

"I won't go through such an embarrassing experience again!"

Alice decided not to come in her pajamas anymore after the embarrassment she faced the other day.

She might change her mind again in the future, though.

"More importantly, I have something to give to everyone today."

"Something to give?"

"Is it another one of those incomprehensible magical devices?"

Yuri's assessment is quite harsh. From the perspective of an Enchantment Magician, do my magical devices really appear to be incomprehensible?

Oh, maybe that's why Grandma reacts so excessively?

"Look, I mentioned it before."

"...Don't tell me you've already created it?"

"Yeah, that's right."

I handed out the wireless communication devices I took from the dimensional storage to everyone.

"As I suspected..."

"Since we learned about the mana stones, it happened so quickly..."

"Oh! So, how do we use it?"

Og and Thor looked bewildered, Alice was filled with curiosity, and their reactions were divided into two.

I explained how to use it and provided information about the assigned numbers.

"The numbers are arranged in order of the entrance exam numbers, making it easy to remember."

"I see. I'm number two."

"I'm number three."

"Well, since this is still a prototype, I'd like all of you to use it and let me know what aspects need improvement."

"I feel like it's already good enough..."

"But there's room for improvement, believe me."

I conveyed the known issues so far.

"I see. Understood. I'll think about it."

The next day, after handing out the wireless communication devices and asking them to try them out, when I entered the classroom, I noticed that several people seemed drowsy.

"Ugh... so sleepy..."

"Alice talks too much. I fell asleep in the middle."

"Lynn, you're so mean! I was talking, and you went to sleep! Thanks to you, I was talking to myself for a while!"

"Talking for two hours before bed is a bit too much."

"But..."

This is another issue that needs addressing.

It's like having a long phone call.

"Mark and Olivia look sleepy too. Did you two have a long... uh, long communication?"

"Huh? Oh, y-yes!"

"Y-yeah, that's right!"

Why are they so flustered...? Oh, I see...

"Mark... you..."

"Y-yes?"

"Alright, everyone's here. Let's start the morning homeroom."

Teacher Alfred arrived.

I couldn't investigate Mark after all.

Well, even if I were to be honest about it here, I wouldn't know how to handle the situation.

More importantly, I didn't get to hear everyone's feedback on using the device.

The break time is short, and during lunch, we head straight to the cafeteria, so maybe after school.

After finishing the classes for the day, mainly focusing on theoretical subjects like history, geography, and mathematics, I think this is Academy number... what? After school, it was time.

"I think we need a notification sound when the communication connects. Alice's voice suddenly echoing in the room was scary."

"Hey, that's a bit too much! Scary?"

"You'll understand if you experience it. It was scary."

"Okay, fine. Then, today, let's have Lynn contact us."

Apart from Lynn, there were many voices agreeing that having a notification sound for incoming communication was necessary.

I did mention it in advance, so perhaps I made them conscious of it.

"Also, there's one issue with the number of devices. Isn't it a bit limited?"

"For now, we're only using it within our team."

"But... if we use it the way you suggested, creating a room where communications from various countries are received... Let's call it a communication room. What do we do when there's an emergency message from there? Do we need another device?"

"Oh, right... there needs to be another communication device that connects to this one."

I got so caught up in the transmission and reception between the devices that I forgot to simulate the practical usage.

"Using a dial for number assignment might have its limitations."

"Needs improvement... indeed."

"Got it. Thanks, I can see the issues now."

At some point, when we distribute these, having too few assignable numbers won't be very useful.

"For now, in the communication room, we can place a transmit-only device without an assigned number. It's one-way communication, but it can still receive emergency messages."

"That's right. It'll have to do for now."

"Anything else?"

"Uh... it's just... it's hard to tell who the communication is coming from..."

Olivia timidly brought this up.

"Well, I'd like to make it possible to know who the communication is coming from eventually, but there are too many things I need to develop for that."

"I see. Well, then, I'll be patient."

I understand what she's saying, but to achieve that, I'll have to at least develop a display, and that's currently not very realistic.

"Another issue... is the long communication sessions? I'm sleep-deprived because of that."

"I can only say that you should practice self-control."

The improvements made this time were:

Adding a notification sound.
Allowing more number assignments.
Considering adding a display in the future.

About the display, I need to discuss it with Dad.

"Okay, everyone, thank you. It might take some time to complete the improved version, so just hold on to these for now."

"Understood."

"But... being here, it feels like time is passing faster..."

"It's not an illusion; it's really advancing. Walford-kun's creations are like the dreams of an Enchantment Mage."

In this world, you don't hear about many new inventions. Perhaps magic makes people less aware of the need for innovations. When Grandma created magical farming tools in the Kurt Kingdom, it was the same: necessity is the mother of invention.

"By the way, there can't be anything else, can there?"

"Hmm? Well..."

"Is there something else?"

"Well, no. For now, it's not a magical tool."

"For now... eventually, it'll be a magical tool, right?"

"Well, yeah. But considering the impact it would have on this world, I can't make it right now."

When I said that, everyone became restless.

"Whaaat?! Walford-kun is holding back?!"

"Is it a sign of a natural disaster?"

"Oh no, we have to escape somewhere! We need to run!"

Everyone's panic was extreme.

Creating self-propelled two-wheelers and four-wheelers would certainly have a big impact on this world!

"At last, it seems my advice has sunk in, doesn't it? So, what were you planning to create?"

"Oh, I was thinking of making a self-propelled vehicle..."

Huh? Everyone's faces...

"As I thought..."

"Even if you restrain from creating it..."

"I haven't restrained my thoughts!"

Their expressions turned incredulous.

"You... You are still..."

"Og?"

"Aren't you the same as before!"

They were furious again.

I did say I'd hold back on creating it!
