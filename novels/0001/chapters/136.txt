Maria and Miranda, Tooru and Julius were fighting in pairs, while Mark was confronting demons alone.

"Uoooryaa!!"

With a spirited shout, Mark swung the magically-imbued sword he had devised himself.

However, Mark was just a blacksmith's son. Compared to his father, who had taught him swordsmanship since childhood, he inevitably lagged in swordsmanship. To compensate for this, he used his magical sword, but his current opponent was a demon from the former Imperial Intelligence Division, who had undoubtedly received combat training. Despite their primary focus on intelligence work, they hadn't skipped combat training, and Mark's sword attacks ended up missing their mark.

"Geez!"

"Whoa, be careful! You're swinging that dangerous thing around!"

The demon, who had dodged Mark's sword, expressed a bit of irritation, then quickly shifted into a counterattack stance.

"You amateur! Don't underestimate a pro!"

"Argh!"

The demon immediately cast a spell, but Mark managed to fend it off with the defensive magic imbued in his accessories and combat attire.

"Argh! Not again! You're seriously annoying with your magic gear!"

As the demon muttered this with evident annoyance, Mark also mumbled, clearly frustrated.

"Darn it! At this rate, I'll end up like before!"

The demon overheard Mark's muttering and grinned smugly.

"Huh? Like before? What are you talking about? It's completely different this time, isn't it? The numbers are in our favor!"

"Huh?"

During their previous encounter with demons, there were fewer of them, resulting in nearly one-on-one battles. However, this time, the demons significantly outnumbered them.

"Oh no..."

"You're too slow! Die, you brat!"

Suddenly, another demon approached Mark from behind, ready to cast a spell.

Mark, caught off guard, hadn't activated his defensive magical equipment yet.

"I've got you—"

"!?"

Just when it seemed hopeless, the demon attacking Mark was unexpectedly blown away by a surprise attack.

Despite being sent flying, the demon's magic seemed weak, and it hadn't suffered a fatal blow; it was still alive.

Noticing this opportunity, Mark once again charged his magic sword with power and swung a flaming sword at the demon.

"Ugh... darn it... scum..."

The demon who had been killed by Mark's magic sword, which he had thought would finally allow him to defeat one of the Ultimate Magicians, was split in two, muttering in frustration before dying.

"What?! Who's there?"

The demon Mark had initially faced also looked surprised, turning to see where the magic attack had come from.

And there she was...

"Olivia!"

"Mark! Are you alright?"

"Yeah! That was perfect support!"

It was Olivia, who had been darting around the battlefield by herself, providing support to everyone. Olivia had realized that her offensive magic alone wouldn't be enough to take down the demons, so she used her experience from running around the busy shop floor to run to the battlefield and assist wherever the situation looked dire.

After being ambushed from behind and rushing to Mark's side, she had turned the tables on the demons with her surprise attack.

However, despite her intuition about Mark's plight, why had she arrived so quickly?

"Hey! Where the hell were you just a moment ago?"

The demon shouted this and cast a spell at Olivia.

"!"

When the spell was cast at her, instead of deploying her defensive magical equipment, Olivia attempted to create a wall of earth in front of her as a form of defense.

"Hah! You think that's gonna stop it?"

As the demon predicted, Olivia's wall of earth was effortlessly destroyed.

Mark, Olivia's boyfriend, watched this unfold with an oddly calm expression.

"Now I've finally—Ack!?"

The demon had thought they had finally taken down one opponent after breaking through the earth wall Olivia had created and continued to attack, but suddenly, they were struck from behind, taking a direct hit.

"W-what the..."

Turning around, the demon found Olivia, whom they thought they had defeated earlier, standing there.

"What the hell did you just do?"

"You don't need to know."

Next to the fallen demon, Mark, who had predicted Olivia's actions, stood ready with his magic sword activated.

"...Hah... In the end, are we just pawns..."

Although not fatally injured, the damage to the demon was substantial enough that they couldn't get up. They looked resigned as they spoke.

"..."

Mark briefly felt pity for the demon, but the opponent was a demon, and there was no room for mercy. Mark raised his magic sword and struck down.

Having finished off the demon, Mark turned to Olivia.

"You're quite skilled with the Gate magic, aren't you?"

Indeed, Olivia's rapid arrival and her sudden appearance behind the demons had all been made possible through her use of Gate magic. She had also tried to shield Mark from using the Gate during his earlier encounter with the demons.

For Mark, who had primarily considered long-distance teleportation, Olivia's mastery of Gate magic was eye-opening.

"Once I decided what I needed to do, I focused on practicing this. I believe I can activate the Gate faster than even Wolforde-kun."

"I see. You're amazing."

As Mark said this, Olivia smiled with delight and turned on her heel.

"Alright, I'll go to the others. I'll come running if things get dangerous again."

"Okay, I'll do my best to make sure that doesn't happen."

Mark nodded in response, and Olivia activated her Gate and disappeared from the spot.

Mark couldn't tell where she had gone, but he soon heard the sounds of magic landing.

"Olivia, nice job!"

Yuri's drawn-out voice reached his ears, indicating that Olivia had likely provided support to Yuri.

Mark admired how Olivia had been assessing the situation while talking to him.

"Yeah, you're right. I never even learned how to use a sword like Tony..."

Mark mumbled to himself, gazing at the magic sword in his hand.

"Just because I came up with a powerful weapon, that doesn't mean I instantly become stronger. What was I thinking?"

Mark mumbled and remembered his recent collaboration with Olivia.

"If I use that as a reference..."

Facing the newly appeared demon, this time Mark decided not to swing the sword immediately but instead began a rapid fire of attack spells. When the demon switched to a defensive stance, Mark dashed forward and activated his magic sword to strike.

Of course, the demon deployed defensive magic, but it was physical defense magic since Mark was attacking with a sword. However, Mark's sword was enhanced with fire magic.

The magic imbued in the sword couldn't be blocked by physical defense magic. As a result, the defensive magic was shattered, and the demon was cut down by the magic sword.

Finally understanding his own fighting style, Mark felt grateful for the indirect guidance he had received from Olivia. With a sense of vague anxiety, he couldn't help but feel like he might be under Olivia's thumb in the future.
