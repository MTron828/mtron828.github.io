 airplane turbulence
to someone who has never flown before

A fire has broken out in the vicinity of Hao's house.

Upon realizing this fact, we hastily ended our banquet and headed towards the scene of the fire.

Shao Lin and Li Fan accompanied us to guide us.

As usual, Li Fan seems to be uncomfortable with flying.

Shao Lin, on the other hand, seems to be doing fine.

"Ugh..."

"Hey, Shao Lin! Are you okay?"

"I'm, I'm sorry, Lady Cecily. I still have a bit of alcohol in my system..."

Oh, I had given Su Lan a pendant for foreign object removal, but I hadn't given Shao Lin and Li Fan theirs during the banquet.

They had worn them at the dinner at the Yu Huang Palace held on our first day in this country, but they were collected afterward.

I had completely forgotten.

"What should we do? Should we land and take a break for a while?"

"No, it's okay. This might turn into a major event in this country. Let's keep going. I'll endure it!"

"I see... Alright, let me know if you can't endure it anymore, okay? It could get really tough."

Are those things falling from the sky...

That would be a disaster.

I hoped they would report it before it happened as we hurried to the scene.

When we arrived at the site of the fire, there were many onlookers and soldiers gathered there.

"Why are there soldiers here instead of firefighters?"

When I voiced my question, Ogg looked around and said, "That's probably the case. Shao Lin, is this indeed the place?"

When Ogg asked, Shao Lin nodded solemnly.

"Yes, this is Hao's house."

"I see."

Shao Lin's guess had been correct.

But why was Hao's home, where he was presumably under house arrest, on fire?

Had Hao, who was likely to be apprehended and lose his power, set his home on fire in desperation?

No, come to think of it, there was a loud noise that could be heard as far as the Min family before the fire broke out.

Was that the cause?

"For now, there's no use standing around here lost in thought. Let's ask the soldiers for information."

Og spoke, and he walked with Shao Lin towards the soldiers.

We followed suit.

The soldier who was approached initially looked skeptical of Og, but when Shao Lin explained, his eyes widened, and he saluted.

"I'm sorry. Can you tell us why this has happened?"

"Yes! We were guarding Hao, who was under house arrest at his residence to prevent his escape. However, his home suddenly exploded a while ago and was quickly engulfed in flames."

"A while ago? You're right; the fire spread incredibly fast."

Although we had heard a noise... it was an explosion, but not much time had passed since then. Despite that, the fire was spreading rapidly.

If it had been a natural ignition, the fire wouldn't have spread so quickly.

So, could it be... magic?

When I suggested this, the soldier nodded.

"So, someone used magic from outside to help Hao escape?"

"No, the magic was cast from inside the house."

"Huh?"

From inside the house?

"Um, were there any other people in the house besides Hao?"

"No, only Hao was inside."

What? So...

"Does that mean Hao caused this situation?"

"Yes... After using magic, Hao emerged from the house and dispersed us as we tried to apprehend him."

"What!?!"

Og and I exclaimed without thinking.

But seriously, if Hao had escaped, why were they taking it so lightly?

"Do we not need to chase after Hao?"

"He's already being pursued. I need to give instructions to the arriving firefighters, so I have to stay here."

"Oh, I see. Sorry for shouting."

"No, it's alright. Ah, the firefighters have arrived."

I followed the soldier's gaze, and people in thick clothing appeared. They were holding cylindrical objects in their hands.

Those must be the firefighters. Could the cylindrical objects be firefighting magical tools?

Thinking that, the soldier approached the firefighters, gave them some instructions, and the firefighters channeled magic into the cylindrical objects they held.

As a result, a large amount of water was discharged from the tip of the magical tools.

It really was firefighting magical tools.

But that wasn't the main concern.

"Excuse me! Do you know which way Hao went?"

Addressing the soldier who was still busy, I shouted loudly, and he responded in kind.

"If it's Hao you're looking for, he fled in that direction!"

Saying this, the soldier pointed in a certain direction.

When I shifted my gaze in that direction, Shao Lin spoke with a trembling voice.

"That way... In that direction, there's the Yu Huang Palace!"

Upon hearing Shao Lin's words, I became certain.

Hao had headed for the Yu Huang Palace.

Whether it was to obtain the weapons he had excavated, to assassinate the emperor, or both, I couldn't say, but it couldn't be anything good.

"Let's hurry and chase after him!"

The firefighters had arrived, and Hao's house had a spacious garden, making the chance of it spreading to neighboring houses low. We should be fine without our help. We needed to pursue Hao.

With that in mind, I activated levitation magic once again and headed for the Yu Huang Palace.

During the journey, I asked Shao Lin about something that had been bothering me.

"By the way, Hao can use magic, it seems."

When I mentioned this, Shao Lin furrowed her brow.

"Shao Lin?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. But Hao... he shouldn't be able to use magic."

"He can't use magic? But the soldier just said that Hao used magic to escape from the house."

"That's why it's strange. I thought he might have used a magical tool, but the soldier specifically said that Hao used magic from inside the house. Not a magical tool."

"So, Hao definitely used magic... However, Hao should not be able to use magic."

"That's what I thought."

"Wait, that's odd."

As Og and I questioned Shao Lin, Lin chimed in.

"People who can't use magic remain unable to do so for life. They don't suddenly gain the ability."

"I share that understanding. Could it be that Hao was hiding the fact that he could use magic?"

"No, it's strange for Hao, who was obsessed with showcasing his power, not to flaunt his special ability."

Shao Lin's evaluation of Hao is harsh.

But if that's the case...

"...Maybe."

Shao Lin, too, might have considered that possibility.

The wrinkles on her forehead deepened.

"What's wrong, Shao Lin? Do you have any insights?" Og, impatient, prodded her.

Shao Lin hesitated for a moment, then finally spoke.

"...Perhaps, Hao might have dabbled in forbidden magic."
