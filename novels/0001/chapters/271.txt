 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

"Hi, I'm Van Stein! Nice to meet you!!"

"I'm Minea Ford!! Nice to meet you!!"

The Ultimate Magicians' new recruit test has concluded, and two new members are joining the group.

One of them is Van Stein, who recently graduated from Kurt's Magic Academy and was working in Kurt's Ministry of Magic. He is a young man with short brown hair and green eyes, a year younger than us, and he appears very serious. Even though he is quite nervous, he bows neatly while greeting.

He has only been in Kurt's Ministry of Magic for a few months, so he doesn't have any work experience, but during his time at the academy, he served as the student council president. His grades, which were initially in the middle, improved through hard work, and he ultimately graduated at the top of his class. He is a very dedicated and hardworking individual.

The other new member is Minea Ford, a girl who graduated from Carnan's Magic Academy last year and is currently working as a hunter. Since she graduated last year, she is the same age as us. She has orange hair and light blue eyes and is a very energetic girl.

You might wonder why she became a hunter after graduating with excellent grades from the magic academy. Well, it turns out that in Carnan, sheep herders are more popular and influential than magicians. But the world of sheep herding is dominated by men, and it's a bit challenging for women to enter. You might think it's gender discrimination, but apparently, it's not. That's because Carnan's sheep herders are all burly men, and while they welcome women, many girls avoid the masculine and rough world of sheep herding.

Minea also found the idea of joining a group of tough guys in the sheep herding world unappealing, even though she was attracted to the fact that they had talented people. On the other hand, the Ministry of Magic has a somewhat inferiority complex when it comes to sheep herding, so there isn't much room for personal growth there. That's why she decided that becoming a hunter, where she could develop her skills through her own efforts, was a better choice.

By the way, I heard these stories during their background checks and final interviews. So, these two were selected as outstanding, hardworking individuals with a strong desire for self-improvement.

"It's both of you, huh? Van, you should relax a little more," I said with a wry smile as I observed the contrasting attitudes of the two.

"No, no! I can't relax when I'm going to learn the Ultimate Magicians' secret techniques!" Van said, maintaining a rigid posture.

"Huh? Aren't you excited, Van? I'm super excited just to have the chance to learn the Ultimate Magicians' extraordinary secret techniques!" Minea replied enthusiastically.

"Why are you so carefree about it? Gate magic is so convenient that it's often used for crimes, which is why the Ultimate Magicians prohibit the teaching of this magic!" Van pointed out.

Oh, Van does have a good understanding of Gate magic.

"But they're willing to teach it to us, so why not?" Minea asked.

"Well, that's true, but... Shin-sama, why have you decided to teach Gate magic?" Van inquired.

"Ah, that's because we can now trace who used Gate magic," I explained.

"What?!"

Oh, right, the magic signature measuring device was still only operational in R'side. We've already pitched it to various countries, and we've received massive orders. However, only the upper echelons of each nation are aware of this. The recruits we've gathered have just graduated from the academy, so they wouldn't know about this high-level information.

So, I explained that investigations are already being carried out using the magic signature measuring device, which detects unique magic signatures, in R'side's security bureau. Van looked dumbfounded, and Minea's eyes sparkled.

"This is amazing! It's so incredible that I don't even know how to put it into words!"

Right, in this case, Van's reaction would be considered normal. Minea's response is more like that of someone who loves magic, similar to Lyn and the researchers at the Magic Academy. She's a magic enthusiast as well.

"This is... amazing. I can't believe I'll get to experience the pinnacle of magic right after joining!" Minea exclaimed with a euphoric expression.

With that, I handed them the necessary communication devices for our team.

"Eek!"

"...".

Minea received the wireless communication device, and after hearing the explanation, she let out a strange cry and began to jump up and down.

As for Van...

He had rolled his eyes and fainted.
