"Is that so? In the end, it was the Demon Lord who plucked Hao's comeback plan, right?"

For now, let's set aside the matter of the weapons from the previous civilization and deal with the current situation in front of us.

So when I conveyed the exchange at the Yuukou Palace to Naval, I got this response:

"Well, it ended up that way, but I didn't know about Hao's scheme."

"I see. But still, is it a weapon powerful enough for a dramatic comeback... Demon Lord, can you reproduce that weapon?"

"No, I can't. It's said to be a weapon excavated from ancient ruins, beyond our knowledge."

"I see..."

Why does he look disappointed?

"What's your plan, Naval diplomat? Do you really want to acquire such a powerful weapon?"

Og countered Naval as if he was suggesting a desire for a powerful weapon.

"N-No! I was just curious, that's all! I wasn't planning to acquire a weapon or anything like that..."

"But you did ask if it could be reproduced, didn't you?"

That's right. Asking that question implies that he also wants it.

Pointed out in this way, Naval scratched his head, looking embarrassed.

"Well, you know... If you see or hear about something rare, you can't help but think, 'Could this be sellable?' It's a bad habit of mine."

That's certainly a bad habit, especially when it comes to weapons.

"Haah... Show some restraint. The demons are gone, the empire that started wars everywhere is no more. We've finally achieved peace, so why bring in a new source of conflict?"

"Haha, I'll reflect on it."

A new source of conflict.

That weapon is indeed that powerful.

The outcome could be determined by whether or not they possess it.

Bringing such a weapon into the western world is unthinkable.

It's best if it remains stored in the courtyard of the Yuukou Palace or in the arsenal.

I can't go into more detail about that.

"Anyway, what about the diplomatic meeting? Have you heard when it will take place?"

"The Quanrong side is in the process of selecting a replacement for Hao and repealing that particular bill, among other things. I've been told they'll let us know once the timing is decided."

"Are we going to have some free time now?"

"That's the idea."

With that, our schedules suddenly opened up.

Or at least, they were supposed to...

"Um..."

While we were discussing with Naval and Og, Suiran chimed in.

"What's the matter, Lord Suiran?" Og asked, and Suiran bowed deeply to us.

"I heard that the bill in question will be repealed, and I don't know how to express my gratitude. Thank you very much," Suiran said, and Shaolin, Liefan, and others also bowed their heads.

Originally, it seems Suiran intended to work on repealing the bill himself once he had recovered, so if it's going to be repealed without his effort, he felt thankful.

But...

"Please raise your heads, Lord Suiran. The bill itself was ridiculous from the start. This outcome is only natural. There's no need to thank us," Og said, and he was right, but Suiran shook his head slightly.

"No. I heard that Hao had a way to overcome it. I think it's because Your Highnesses were here that it didn't work as planned. It was an unexpected turn of events for Hao. So, in that sense, I want to express my gratitude to Your Highnesses," Suiran said, and the members of the Ming family nodded in agreement.

It was purely a coincidence, though.

We didn't act to thwart Hao's plan.

Feeling a bit perplexed by Suiran and the others' expressions of gratitude, Naval saw Suiran smile faintly.

"Well, then, please accept our gratitude for minimizing the dragon's damage. Many of our company members were stationed in the village that you saved. Thank you very much."

That makes sense.

It's a village near the dragon's habitat, after all.

It wouldn't be surprising for company members to be there, whether they're the ones hunting the dragons or just sourcing their hides.

Well, I don't know if they're the ones hunting the dragons or just procuring the hides.

Anyway, if that's the case, we were the ones who saved the village from danger.

"In that case, let's accept their gratitude," Og said. "If that's how it is, it's only fair to be appreciated."

"Very well, if that's the case, let's accept their thanks."

"As decided, we should express our gratitude right away. Let's have a celebration to thank you for saving the village and for Hao's downfall and the repeal of the bill!"

Suiran said, and immediately started giving instructions to the servants before leaving the living room.

Come to think of it, we had a celebration on the first day we arrived here.

I wonder if he's fond of celebrations?

"Well, he seems quite happy," Og remarked.

"He's having all his problems solved in one go, so it's understandable that he'd want to celebrate," Naval added.

While Naval and Og commented on Suiran's departure, the door opened again, and Suiran poked his head in.

"Oh, let's discuss the magic stone trade tomorrow!"

With that, he disappeared again.

Suiran's actions made us all chuckle involuntarily.

Shaolin looked a bit embarrassed.

"Well, well, he may be excited, but he hasn't forgotten he's the shrewd head of a trading company," Naval remarked, and everyone nodded in agreement.
