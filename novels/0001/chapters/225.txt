"Haa... I'm finally free."

Mark and Yuri bombarded me with questions about the car, and I plopped down on the sofa.

"Thank you for your hard work. Here, have some tea."

"Oh, thanks, Sicily."

Sicily handed me a cup of tea as I slumped in exhaustion. In Earlsheid, tea meant black tea, but the tea served in Kuanglong looked more like Chinese tea. The vessels had no handles, similar to a teacup.

I received it and sipped the steaming tea.

"Haa."

"By the way, Lord Shin seems to be enjoying it. Did you like it that much?"

As the tea seeped into my tired body, I involuntarily sighed, and Shaolin-san asked with a hint of joy.

Her expression had brightened considerably compared to earlier. It was likely because she had shared her feelings and found a solution.

"If you'd like, can you take some tea leaves back as a souvenir?"

"Huh? Is that okay?"

I couldn't help but jump at Shaolin-san's suggestion.

"It's no problem. Oh, and you'll need a teapot, so I'll include that too."

"Th-thank you so much!"

She's not only giving me tea leaves but also a teapot and a cup without handles.

I genuinely appreciated it, but Sicily seemed quite apologetic.

Shaolin-san shook her head in response to Sicily.

"It's fine. This is also an apology for suspecting Lord Shin for so long."

"I see."

"Yes, so please accept it as a gift this time."

"This time?"

In response to Sicily's question, Shaolin-san smiled softly.

"Yes. The exchange rate hasn't been set yet. So, please consider making a purchase next time."

This time it's an apology, so it's free, but next time, buy it? Shaolin-san seemed to be saying that, and Sicily returned a smile.

"Hehe. Well then, I'll gratefully accept your kind offer. Thank you."

"Of course. Please continue to favor us in the future."

Sicily and Shaolin-san exchanged smiles with each other.

It's so harmonious now that I can't believe what happened earlier.

"Nevertheless, there was still something valuable in that ruin."

Shaolin, who had been smiling with Sicily a moment ago, now turned to me and said, "From my perspective, that ruin is a treasure trove. Why is it left untouched?"

Even with such advanced remnants of a civilization, I couldn't help but wonder why it was left untouched.

"That's because the only artifacts that can be used as they are excavated from the ruins are weapons."

"As they are... Oh, I see."

"Yes. Most other items have corroded and lost their original form, but weapons can be excavated as they are."

"I see. So, does that mean they applied some kind of preservation enchantment to the weapons, but not to everyday items?"

"That's probably the case."

"What do you mean? Why not apply the same enchantment to everyday items?"

As I and Shaolin were discussing this, Alice asked with curiosity, "Weapons are meant to defeat enemies, but they're also meant to protect oneself, right? It would be a problem if they break, but it's acceptable for everyday items to break to some extent."

"Why?"

"Don't you need them to break so people will buy new ones?"

Even in my previous life, I had the impression that older appliances were less likely to break, while newer ones were more fragile. Companies wouldn't make a profit unless people replaced their items or purchased consumables.

"Wow, you're sharp!"

"Well, it can't be helped, Alice. Everyday items need to break to some extent; otherwise, businesses won't make a profit."

Alice accused companies of being cunning, but Mark understood, being the son of a workshop owner.

"Could it be that Mark's family's magical tools are designed to be fragile?"

"We're not doing something like that! We simply don't apply an enchantment that prevents weapons from breaking! And even if we did, it wouldn't make sense."

"Why not? It's better if they don't break."

"Even if you apply the enchantment, you have to continuously channel magic into it for it to work."

"Oh, I see. So, the weapons found in the ruins use magic stones?"

When Alice asked, Shaolin nodded.

"It's for maintenance, so the magic stones used are very small."

"Wow, that's quite extravagant."

Magic stones are still relatively rare in the western world. With such abundant use of magic stones, it seemed increasingly likely that they were artificially created.

"In that case, putting so much emphasis on using magic stones to maintain weapons... Was the previous civilization such a violent world?"

Og frowned at the enchantments placed on weapons.

"Who knows? Building such an advanced civilization suggests that frequent conflicts may not have been common."

"But judging by the damage to the buildings, it seems like wars were the only explanation."

"Was it for defense against monsters? Shaolin, what kind of ruins do weapons get excavated from?"

Og, who had been discussing with Thor and others, turned to Shaolin for answers.

"Items like the ones we found today are almost never found in ruins like that. But when they are found, they are discovered in large quantities all at once."

"Hmm, like a military weapon storage?"

"I believe that's probably the case."

Today's ruins had looked like an office district. It was unlikely they kept weapons there. However, the term "almost" suggested that they occasionally found something. Some people had these items, whether for self-defense or criminal purposes.

In that case, Og's suggestion of a weapons storage facility made sense. It seemed that even in the past and the present, they had to deal with monster threats.

"In that case, did Hao excavate those weapons from a military arsenal?"

When Og said this, Shaolin nodded with a serious expression.

"That's correct. According to General, they have not received any reports of Hao finding a weapon storage facility containing powerful weapons that would lead to rebellion. Currently, they are questioning the information from Hao's private soldiers, and we expect to locate the facility soon."

"Is the management of these places strict?"

"Very much so."

"If weapons like this were excavated again and fell into the hands of those with ill intentions, the worst-case scenario can be considered."

"The military will be very concerned, then."

"Yes."

Hao had pulled out a railgun without any ammunition loaded, so there was no damage this time. However, if there had been ammunition loaded and it had been fired on the spot...

We didn't know where the Emperor of Kuanglong was, but if it had been fired towards his location, the consequences would have been dire.

It could have triggered a political upheaval through the assassination of the Emperor.

"Lately, no new ruins have been discovered, but I think this incident will encourage more exploration of ruins."

"Ruins exploration, huh..."

After hearing Shaolin's report, Og thought with his arms crossed.

"What's on your mind?"

"Well, in Kuanglong, ruins are easily found, but in our region, they haven't been found at all."

"That's true. It's led to the previous civilization being treated as a legend in Earlsheid."

Tony, who loved urban legends, was drawn to Og's question.

"Could it be that the previous civilization only flourished in this area?"

"Could they really build such an incredible city? That would be odd."

Alice and Maria also joined the conversation.

Even Maria, who wasn't fond of the occult, might not find the idea of a lost civilization as scary.

"But, but, there are so many ruins in Kuanglong. Why aren't there any in the Earlsheid area?"

"...Maybe they were completely obliterated and turned to dust."

I unintentionally muttered Alice's words.

At that moment, everyone's gaze focused on me.

"Perhaps the country that was in the Earlsheid area and the one in the Kuanglong area... the Eastern world collided. And the country from the Western world was utterly crushed. The towns, villages, everything was wiped out."

"N-no... is that even possible..."

Og said in a trembling voice in response to my conjecture.

Well, in this world's common sense, it might be hard to believe.

"Maybe it was possible? They seemed to be able to fly in the sky," I said, and Thor seemed to understand.

"So, that means they fired a colossal spell from the sky..."

"It might not have been magic. They might have scattered magical tools."

"They must have imagined a scenario where magical items with the power of ultra-high-level magic fell from the sky."

Everyone's faces turned pale.

"We don't know the circumstances that led to it, but... maybe one side used them first? And as retaliation, the other side used similar magical items. As a result, they couldn't back down, and they kept fighting until one side was wiped out."

Crossing a line and losing sight of when to stop.

These two factors might have led to the collapse of the previous civilization.

"What was the world like after the war? One side disappeared completely, and the other suffered so much damage that they couldn't maintain their civilization. Most likely, humanity came close to extinction."

The records of the previous civilization were completely wiped out, and I couldn't even imagine the extent of the destruction.

Nevertheless, the remaining humans slowly increased in number, and the current world was eventually formed.

"Well, it's all just imagination since there are no records."

When I said that, everyone who had been silently listening collectively sighed.

"Man, what a terrifying imagination you have."

Og, with a disgusted expression, said, "Really? It felt like you were quite certain..."

Others nodded in agreement with Maria's words.

"I'm not certain at all. It's just that when I heard Shaolin's story and considered the collapse of such an advanced civilization, as well as the fact that no ruins have been found in the Earlsheid area, or rather the Western world, it seemed like a natural conclusion, didn't it?"

I explained that I had speculated in these steps to avoid being seen as someone who already knew what would happen if a war occurred in a world similar to our previous life. Some faces showed signs of understanding.

"If it was an indiscriminate attack from the sky, it's not hard to believe that civilians were caught up in it."

"I don't want to believe that civilians were involved in a war, but... if that's the case, I can accept it. I can't understand it, though."

"That's right. But what can we do? War is something that shouldn't happen in the first place, but differences in national interests, territorial disputes, and conflicts can occur."

In conflicts between nations, ordinary civilians are not involved.

However, in the wars that occurred during the previous civilization, entire countries disappeared.

This implies that many civilians were sacrificed.

...Perhaps, in the previous civilization, there were deliberate actions to invoke memories of their past lives in children.

Their ethical values might have been severely distorted.

I wasn't the only one who thought this way.

"Destroying an entire nation... it's like Strohme," Alice, with an unusually solemn expression, muttered, representing everyone's feelings, and they all had gloomy faces.

"Did there exist Archmages in the previous civilization?" Maria asked.

In response to Maria's question, Og appeared pensive.

"They might have existed, but what's even scarier is if regular humans did this. In fact, that possibility is more likely."

Strohme and the Archmages who followed him had a terrifying amount of resentment against the Empire.

As a result, they committed massacres not only among the Emperor and the nobility but also among the common citizens.

However, what happened in the previous civilization was a war.

It wasn't revenge driven by hatred.

Despite that, fighting until the complete annihilation of enemy nations... it's not sane.

"But did the one who created those magical items not consider such a possibility? The world literally ended."

"Perhaps they never actually thought they would be used?" I answered Og's question, and they stared at me as if urging me to continue.

"The creators might have intended them as a deterrent, showing 'we have such weapons here,' to discourage enemy nations from recklessly attacking. However, the opposing nation may have developed similar weapons as a response. Then, one of the nations actually used them. It turned into a retaliation cycle, perhaps."

My statement left everyone speechless, lost in thought.

Is it such a surprising notion?

It seems like a hypothesis that you'd naturally arrive at when deducing the situation.

"The developers probably emphasized not using them, but the leaders of the previous civilization may not have perceived the developer's intentions," I continued.

Since it was a powerful magical tool, they used it.

That might have been the extent of it.

I don't know the exact political structure of the previous civilization.

Was it an autocracy or a democracy?

If there were individuals with memories of their past lives among the ruling elite, they could have advised against using that magical device.

However, in order to invoke memories of their past lives, they would need to bring young children to the brink of death.

It's hard to believe that the rulers would do such a thing to their own children.

As a result, those who didn't understand the prohibition were in positions of power.

And thus, the collapse occurred.

While considering such predictions for the collapse of the previous civilization, Alice said something unexpected.

"Hmm, this is it. That theory has suddenly become quite plausible."

"That theory?"

What's she talking about?

I wondered, but my heart raced as she continued.

"Shin, you have memories of the previous civilization, don't you!"
