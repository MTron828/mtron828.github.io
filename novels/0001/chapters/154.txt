At first, even the soldiers who didn't notice Aug's presence kneeled when they saw the soldier kneeling ahead and then realized Aug's presence as well.

This movement spread like a wave, and soldiers knelt one after another.

Oh... What an incredible sight.

"Oh! Your Highness! Are you safe?!!"

Director Gastorol, who noticed this scene, approached us.

Beside him, there were Magic Division Commander Orglun, and even the old men and women, as well as Michelle.

Director Gastorol knelt in front of Aug and inquired about the situation here.

"So, Your Highness has returned safely..."

"Yes. We have defeated the leader of the demons, Strom, and the other demons."

Aug's voice seemed to reach the soldiers who had kneeled down quietly.

"Uwaaaah! Complete victory!!!"

The soldiers who had knelt down stood up, and another round of cheers erupted.

Silver, who had calmed down a bit, also cried out loudly again.

Naturally, Director Gastorol noticed Silver.

"So, Your Highness? What about this child...?"

The surrounding soldiers must have been curious too. People near us stopped cheering and eavesdropped on our conversation.

Oh no, what should I do?

I hadn't thought of an excuse.

Just when I was in trouble, Aug started talking.

"Oh, there seemed to be someone who survived in the Imperial Capital. The child's parents were already dead, but this child miraculously survived. I protected her."

Ugh, this guy is good at lying so smoothly.

And the attack on the Imperial Capital happened over a year ago. Honestly, I thought this excuse would be hard to believe.

"What?! Surviving in such a situation! It's a miracle! A miraculous child!!"

"Uwaaah! Hooray for the miraculous child!!"

"Hooray!!"

Did they believe the lie?

As I watched the soldiers praising Silver one after another in disbelief, Aug whispered in my ear.

"Everyone is in high spirits because we've overcome this crisis. In such situations, people want to believe even the most unbelievable things as miracles."

... Is that so?

In other words, if we were calm, we would have many questions, but since we're in an excited state, we can't think deeply about things.

So, if there were someone who could think calmly, this excuse wouldn't work...

"So? What's the real story?"

See! There he is, a calm person!

In fact, it's Granny!

I thought this excuse wouldn't work...

"We should discuss the details somewhere else."

"Then let's go to the main headquarters."

And so, we headed through the gate to the main headquarters located on the other side of the wall that covered the Demon Capital.

Waiting for us on the other side of the gate were the leaders of various nations.

Uncle Dis, Lady Ekaterina, Sir Aaron, and the other kings.

"Oh!! Welcome back, August! Well done! Well done!"

They must have heard the battle situation through the communication device, and they welcomed us with cheers as we emerged from the gate.

Uncle Dis seemed worried about Aug.

As soon as he saw him, he ran over and embraced him.

"...Father, this is embarrassing."

"What are you talking about? Don't you understand the feelings of a father who sent his son to the battlefield?"

"Sigh... I understand. I'll accept it willingly for now."

"...I feel some distance between us, though."

"It's just your imagination."

While Uncle Dis and Aug were having that kind of exchange, Lady Ekaterina came over to me.

"Truly... You did very well, Shin. Thank you for your hard work."

Saying that, Lady Ekaterina hugged me.

"Hey! Lady Ekaterina!"

"I'm really glad... It felt like sending my son to the battlefield..."

"That way of putting it might lead to misunderstandings! Um, it's not like that! I'm not Lady Ekaterina's secret child or anything like that! It's more like an older sister worried about her younger brother or something, you know!?"

I desperately explained to those around me, as it seemed like something that could be misunderstood by people who didn't know the situation.

At that moment...

"What are you doing?!"

"Ouch!"

A fist struck Lady Ekaterina's head.

The only one in the world who could do such a thing to the Pope of the Church of the Creator was Lady Ekaterina.

"What are you doing, causing unnecessary misunderstandings!"

"Eep! I-I'm sorry, Master!"

When Granny said that, Lady Ekaterina welled up with tears and apologized.

...Seeing her like this, the significance of having a Pope seems to diminish...

The main headquarters was in chaos, but with a single word, everyone snapped back to attention.

"Oh..."

"Huh? A baby?"

When Silver spoke, everyone fell silent, and Lady Ekaterina's eyes widened when she saw Silver in Cecily's arms.

"I see, it seems there was a survivor in the Imperial Capital. This survivor apparently had a child... the parents are deceased, it seems. We've been protecting these children."

The grandmother, with the most speaking authority at the scene, explained, and none of the world leaders objected.

...Granny is truly amazing.

"I see... May this child's parents be guided to the divine presence..."

Lady Ekaterina said this and prayed.

...My feelings were quite complicated, but I couldn't interject.

Eventually, after Lady Ekaterina's prayer, Aug approached Uncle Dis.

"Father, I have something to discuss in private."

"Hmm? I see. Then shall we move to our country's tent outside?"

"Yes."

"Sorry for leaving the meeting for a while."

Uncle Dis called out to the remaining leaders and left the main headquarters.

We followed, and for some reason, Lady Ekaterina and Sir Aaron also tagged along.

"Well... it's just a private discussion..."

Aug spoke to Lady Ekaterina with a puzzled expression, but Lady Ekaterina seemed unfazed.

"Oh, well, I'm your father's junior disciple, right? That makes it 'inside,' doesn't it?"

"I'm a junior disciple too, so it's an inside matter."

"Well..."

Even Aug, it seems, couldn't assert himself against Lady Ekaterina, who was the Pope of the Church of the Creator.

I whispered to Aug.

"It's fine. Let's just involve them since we're at it."

"...Alright, I understand. Please join us, both of you."

When Aug said that, the two of them happily walked forward.

You're the one who got yourself into this, right?

I won't accept complaints later.

Inside the tent prepared for the Kingdom of Arlstheid, we revealed Silver's true identity.

The reactions of everyone at that moment were truly speechless.

"The child of the demons... Strom's child..."

"For real... Can such a thing really happen?"

The military duo of Director Gastorol and Commander Orglun had expressions of disbelief.

Michel, a former soldier, remained silent while looking at Silver.

"Well, I thought there was something fishy going on, but I didn't expect it to be such a big deal."

"Hmm... It's hard to believe all of a sudden."

Granny muttered in amazement, and Grandpa expressed disbelief.

And then...

"We shouldn't have asked..."

Ekaterina and Aaron, who regretted hearing this story.

Well, you were the ones who stuck your noses into this, right?

Unlike the two who seemed to regret tagging along, Uncle Dis, who was the party involved, wore a difficult expression for a while and then spoke up.

"So, what are you planning to do with this child?"

"Well..."

Aug said this, then looked at me, so I took over.

"Shirley and I will raise her."

While holding Silver, Cecily came to my side and nodded.

"My goodness..."

Uncle Dis was left speechless by our determination.

At that point, I reiterated what I had explained to Aug earlier.

"Hmm... that's certainly true, but..."

As Uncle Dis pondered, someone else chimed in.

"Are you really okay with this?"

Granny, with a serious expression and not anger, looked at Cecily and me.

"Can you properly raise a child with such a complex background? If you're just sympathizing with that woman demon, you should reconsider. It'll be tough."

"That's true..."

Listening to Granny and Grandpa's words, I couldn't help but smile.

"What's so funny?"

"Well... Grandpa, Grandma, I never expected to hear that from you."

"What do you mean?"

"You know, Grandpa, I don't even know whose child I am or where I'm from."

"That's... true..."

"Complex background? I don't even know my own background. I don't even know who my real parents are."

"..."

"..."

"Gramps found me like that, you know. He and Granny raised me together. I've heard it might have been an atonement because they couldn't protect their own children, but... I never felt any sense of obligation from Gramps and Granny."

This is the truth.

"I can say it with pride. I'm the Sage's grandson. The Priest's grandson. I'm the beloved grandson of both of them."

"Shin..."

"You..."

"So, you know, I want to continue that love and pass it on to this child."

Saying this, I stroked Silver's head.

Silver happily giggled.

"And... It was entrusted to that person... Miss Milia entrusted her to me. That's why I will raise her with responsibility. So please, acknowledge it."

Cecily, who was holding Silver, said this and lowered her head.

"Please."

I also bowed my head beside her.

After a while, we heard Granny's long sigh.

"Sigh... I understand, I understand, so lift your heads."

"Granny!"

"Madam!"

"Geez, if you say something like that, we won't be able to say anything, you know."

"That's right. If we refuse here, the love we poured into Shin would become a lie."

"Gramps..."

"Shin, you are undoubtedly my grandson. It doesn't matter whose child you are from where. That's why you should pour your love onto that child without holding back."

"Yes, of course!"

"Thank you, Grandfather!"

With Granny's understanding, which was thought to be the most difficult hurdle, this issue was resolved.

Once Granny approved, not even Uncle Dis, Lady Ekaterina, or Sir Aaron could object.

"Still, I never expected to see my great-grandchild so soon."

"Hehe. It was worth the effort."

Granny accepted Silver from Cecily and cradled her in her arms.

"Oh, there, there. By the way, does this child have a name?"

"Yes. The person who gave birth to this child named her Silvesta, so I thought we should keep it as Silvesta."

"Silvesta, so it's Silver, right? There, there, Silver, I'm your great-grandma."

"You're cheating, Merida. Let me hold her too."

"You held Slaine and made him cry. It's not allowed."

"What..."

"Master! Let me hold her too!"

For some reason, Ekaterina desperately appealed to hold Silver.

"Aww... So cute... If Shin's adopting her, that makes her my grandchild..."

"Hey, stop saying weird stuff!"

"Why not? Shin is like my son, isn't he?"

"No way!"

What is she even saying? If she starts claiming she's the grandchild of the High Priest of the Creation Faith, Granny will get angry again!

"Sigh... Seriously... Well, leaving that aside, I will announce that this child is a miraculously surviving citizen of the Empire, as I explained to everyone earlier. Well... it's not entirely wrong in a broad sense. Oh, I'll make it clear, it's not for political gain, okay? By my announcement, we can get away with some things."

Oops, quite the calculation there. She believes that if she declares it, people will believe even a somewhat implausible excuse.

This way, by calculating that she would make the announcement herself.

"Well... I suppose it can't be helped this time."

"That's right."

Granny had to reluctantly agree with this.

Finally, all the problems were resolved.

Now...

"I'll declare the end of the situation, and then... it's your wedding, right?"

Ekaterina said this and winked at Shin and Cecily.

"Oh, right..."

"Hehe, we had a child before the wedding."

Saying this, the two of them smiled at each other.

Behind us, though...

"Hey, Aaron."

"What's up, big brother?"

"It's just... everyone else got decided on except for me..."

"That's true... How about you complain to our master?"

"Aaron, are you telling me to die?"

"Just kidding."

Uncle Dis and Aaron were having a conversation like that.

...I get the feeling that when Granny gets involved, the men become passive...

In the end, Uncle Dis didn't go against Granny's approval, and he agreed to welcome Silver as our adopted child and to publicly acknowledge her as a miraculously surviving citizen of the Empire. pick
