A few days after having a conversation with Allen and the others, I made an appointment with Oug and went to the royal castle.

By the way, Alisha, who had come to play that day, was surprised to see Oug and her attendant Ellie, who had brought Via to my place through the gate. She was so surprised that she froze.

It's a common occurrence in my house, so she'll get used to it eventually. Just like Allen and Cresta did, they got used to Oug and Ellie and can now greet and chat with them like it's normal.

Humans are creatures that adapt.

Now, the reason for today's visit is not to report on the children's current situation. During a casual conversation with Allen and the others at that time, I had a thought and came to consult with Oug.

"Sorry, Shin, for making you wait."

I was waiting in the private reception room in the familiar royal family's private space, and Oug, who had finished his work, arrived.

"No problem, I just finished as well."

While Earlside is a monarchy by the royal family, it doesn't mean the king handles all governmental matters. There are specialized departments in various areas, each with its own director. The royal family's main role is to make the final decisions on important national matters. They do participate in meetings that decide the country's policies, but otherwise, they have relatively free time.

Today, when I contacted him, Oug happened to be working, and I received a response that he would meet me after finishing his work.

"So, what did you want to discuss?"

"Well, actually, the other day, Allen and Cresta came to our house to hang out."

"Silver's friends, I see. And?"

"Those kids are the same age as Silver, so they're going to have their magical aptitude tested, right? Both of them seem to have magical aptitude."

"I see. I've heard that friendships can change based on the presence or absence of magical aptitude, so it's a good thing they have it in common."

"Yeah, that's true, but I'm a little concerned."

"Concerned?"

When I said that, Oug straightened up.

"Well, they said my face looks scary."

"You often notice things that lead to significant discoveries in the magical world. I need to ask seriously. So, what did you notice?"

Under the pressure from Oug's intensity, I began to explain what I had noticed the other day.

"I don't have solid proof. I haven't conducted any experiments. But, recently, don't you think there has been an increase in children with aptitude for magic? And the time when I introduced magical tools for toddlers, providing them with more opportunities to interact with magical tools since a young age, coincides with this. It's only natural to consider whether there's a connection, right?"

When I said that, Oug furrowed his brow and then let out a "Huh" in contemplation.

"We can't make any announcements without proper verification, but if this turns out to be true, it would be a significant discovery."

"What should we do? Should we report it to the Magic Academy immediately?"

"I'll take care of that on my end. Despite how I may appear, I graduated as the second highest-ranking student from the Advanced Magic Academy. As for you, I'd like to request an increase in the production of magical toys. If possible, could you also expand the variety of these toys?"

"Variety?"

"Your magical toys are well-received by toddlers, but they become less appealing as children grow older, right?"

"Yeah, well, they're pretty much useless magical tools."

"For the sake of verification, I'd like to have a variety of magical toy options that can be used even by slightly older children."

"I see, you mean raising the target age range."

Upon hearing Oug's words, I grinned.

"If it's a request from the Crown Prince, I'll put all my effort into developing these magical tools."

"Just keep it in moderation! Moderation!"

Oug desperately tried to restrain me, but these are essentially toys for elementary school kids. With no competition from other companies and a bit of fun in them, I don't think going a little overboard will be a problem.

"Now, I'll get to work on the development right away. Please take care of reporting to the Magic Academy and spreading the word to families with children!"

"Hey! Seriously! Just keep it in moderation!"

Despite Oug's words, it will be fine. They're just toys, and I think it's not a big deal as long as children's eyes sparkle with excitement. And so, I embarked on the development of these toys. marketing strategies
