Today, as always, I'm going to the forest.

I'm going to the forest in search of prey.

...Or rather, I live in the forest.

Hello again, I've grown a bit and now I'm eight years old. I'm Shin.

Since then, Michelle-san's training, or rather, her "discipline," has been upgraded. Well, thanks to that, I can now use magic for strengthening my body.

What has changed in these three years is not just the upgrade of martial arts training. I've gained another mentor.

Actually, besides the magic I talked about before, which involves controlling magical power and releasing it, there is something called "Enchantment Magic," which transfers magical power carrying a concept onto objects. It turns out that my grandpa isn't particularly good at this type of magic.

It seems he's more inclined to releasing magic than enchanting. So, the decision was made for him to learn this magic from one of his customers who excels at enchanting magic.

And this teacher is quite the witchy type, wearing a black robe, glasses, and a pointed hat. She's tall and has a fantastic figure, despite looking like a grandma. I bet she was quite popular in her youth.

Her name is "Merida Bowen."

I call her "Merida baachan." She doesn't respond if you call her "Merida-san," but when you call her "baachan," she looks incredibly happy.

...I wonder if something happened between grandpa and her in the past... I'm too scared to ask.

As for the essential enchantment magic, it's not particularly difficult to perform. You just need to imagine the phenomenon you want to enchant onto your fingertips or the tip of your staff, gather magical power, and then transfer it to the desired item using a certain method. After that, you just need to infuse it with magical power, and the enchanted magic will activate.

This is a very useful technique for people who can't use magic, and those who can perform enchantment magic are highly valued by ordinary folks.

However, enchanted items, or "magical tools," are rare and expensive, so they are not something you can easily come by. How many you possess becomes a status symbol, but the actual items themselves don't have to be expensive; the high cost is mostly for the technical skill involved.
!

So, the method for transferring that magical power is to "write down the phenomenon in words you understand."

Writing these characters is a bit tricky, and the number of characters you can write is actually limited depending on the material you're writing on. Cheaper materials allow for fewer characters, while more expensive ones allow for more.

Conversely, the more characters you can inscribe, the more expensive it becomes. In this world, just like with alphabets, characters only make sense when you have a few of them together. So, if the spelling has many characters, it's not uncommon for the word to exceed the character limit.

That's when I suddenly wondered, what would happen if I inscribed it with kanji characters? If a single character could convey a meaning, it might allow for more characters to be inscribed.

I gave it a try out of curiosity, and it worked easily. Though baachan gave me quite an interrogation afterward.

Thanks to that, enchantment magic has become as beloved to me as the magic I used before, the so-called release magic.

...Martial arts are still as tough as ever, though.

And as I'm out hunting now, I have weapons created using enchantment magic in my hands.

For long-range attacks, there's the "Rifle."

For close combat, there's the "Vibration Sword."

For support, there's the "Jet Boots."

And for defense, there's the "Protect Suit."

The "Rifle" is as it sounds, but it's an air gun that fires compressed air instead of bullets using gunpowder. Well, it's way more powerful than an air gun.

The "Vibration Sword" is a blade that vibrates with ultrasonic waves.

As a kid, I can carry it, and since there aren't many other things I can do while strengthening my body, I thought of applying this enchantment to a thin and light weapon.

It received a good reception, and many people, especially weaker magic users, asked me to make it as their main weapon. Even warrior-type people found it helpful for materials gathering and such.

The "Jet Boots" have jet propulsion at the heels, allowing for movement and jumping assistance. They also enable mid-air direction changes.

Making them wasn't too difficult, but controlling them was quite a challenge. I can't count how many times I crashed before I could handle them.

Watching this, those around me didn't express a desire for me to create these. They had somewhat ambiguous expressions.

And finally, the "Protect Suit" is just regular clothing with enchantments for "slash protection," "impact resistance," and "magic resistance." The effects are as they sound.

After all, armor and leather are heavy and restrict movement. I thought this would be well-received, but surprisingly, opinions were divided.

People like the magic users, similar to baachan, praised it, while those like Michelle and the warrior-type folks had mixed reactions.

Wrapped in such equipment, I hide in the grass as usual, aiming for prey.

Today, I'm targeting a huge boar.

It's devouring the scattered nuts on the ground.

I circle around to the front of the boar, which is engrossed in its meal, and point my rifle at its forehead.

The bullet is absorbed into its forehead with pinpoint accuracy, destroying its brain and exiting from the back of its head.

No matter how big they are, if their brain is destroyed, they can't survive. The nearly 300-kilogram body falls to the ground.

I quickly tie a rope to a nearby tree and hang the boar's legs, then proceed to bleed it out, taking care not to spill blood.

Once the bleeding is done, I proceed with the butchering.

At first, I felt queasy, but you get used to it. Now, the prey just looks like meat to me.

After finishing the hunt and returning home, both baachan and Michelle are there today.

"Oh, welcome back. Were you out hunting?"

"Good day, baachan. Yeah, I went hunting for boars today."

"Oh, you can already hunt boars?"

I have a bad feeling about this.

"No, I used a rifle, and I still can't handle a sword."

"Haha, don't be so modest. You were able to face such large prey with a projectile weapon. Perhaps we should intensify your training a bit more."

Yes, here comes the standard response.

I looked at grandpa with a hopeful look.

"Hoho, take it easy, my boy."

Another standard response!

But seriously, grandpa hasn't said anything else lately!
