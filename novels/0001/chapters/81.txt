"I couldn't completely annihilate the demon."

"And they escaped towards the Arlsheid direction."

"Since the Arlsheid army is expected to be advancing from that direction, there's a possibility of a confrontation."

"If they break through there, behind them is the Kingdom of Arlsheid."

"At this rate, Arlsheid will become a battlefield!"

"Og! I'm going to open a gate to Arlsheid!"

"No, wait! It's not guaranteed that they will appear in Arlsheid! With your levitation magic, you might be able to catch up. I'll follow them! I won't let them escape!"

To my suggestion of waiting in Arlsheid, Og expressed a desire to capture them before that, as it was not guaranteed that they would appear there.

Certainly, if we can catch up to them...

"What will you do if you can't capture them?"

"In that case, I'll declare a state of emergency to all the countries! Damn it! They've made it difficult until the very end!"

Og's tone has become rough.

He seems quite agitated because Arlsheid might become the target.

I also want to rush out right now, but I can't leave the Alliance forces behind.

"We will chase after the escaped demons! While we do that, I want all of you to continue subduing the surrounding monsters and head back to the Imperial Capital. I'm counting on you!"

After Og issued instructions to the Alliance forces again using amplification magic, he cast levitation magic on all the Ultimate Magicians.

Levitation magic can only be used by me.

If everyone could use it, we could divide the search tasks, but I didn't know how to teach levitation magic, unlike other spells, so I had to put it on hold.

To make sure we don't overlook anything, we decided to track them together.

"Which way should we go!?"

"Hey! Which way!?"

The reconnaissance team cast detection magic in the direction indicated, but it seemed that the demons had already moved out of its range, and they couldn't detect them.

To find out the exact direction the demons were heading, Og asked the members of the reconnaissance team.

A rough tone that doesn't seem like Og, who is usually respected by soldiers from other countries.

It's evident that he's quite anxious about the possibility of his own country being threatened.

"Yes, it's in that direction!"

"Understood! Let's go! Full speed!"

And so, we moved into what seemed like the final pursuit.

"Everyone, use detection magic to search the surroundings! Don't miss anything!"

"Roger!"

In such a situation, it would have been a good idea to provide the radio communication devices to Siegfried and the others, even if it was just the open channel. That way, we could have established immediate contact and raised the alarm.

However, I hesitated to provide radio communication devices to avoid potential accusations of collusion or favoritism since we had given special magical tools only to Arlsheid.

This decision ended up backfiring on us. If we hadn't been accompanying them, we should have overlooked such minor privileges and handed out the communication devices.

For now, all we can do is hope that the Arlsheid army won't encounter the demons.

As we tracked the demons, we had to maintain full speed while searching, which made it challenging. We wanted to find them quickly, but we couldn't push ourselves to go at full speed. Frustrated by this dilemma, we flew in the direction where we thought the demons had fled.

The demons weren't exceptionally strong, but there were around fifty of them. It would take some time to eliminate them all.

How far have they gone? Can we catch up?

And, more importantly, are they really ahead of us? Is our direction correct?

With these anxieties plaguing us one after the other, we concentrated on detection, making sure not to overlook any trace.

At that moment, if even one person had headed for Arlsheid using a gate, we might not have been in such a predicament.

The Arlsheid army knew they wouldn't make it in time for the demon extermination mission led by Shin, but they couldn't afford to stay out of the final stage. If they were absent from such a historic moment, Arlsheid could become isolated from the world.

So, they changed their route from heading to the old Imperial Capital, and they hurried towards the city where the demons were discovered.

"Why are the demons gathering in a place that's not the old Imperial Capital?"

"How many times are you going to complain about this?"

Siegfried muttered for what seemed like the umpteenth time.

Christina shared the same sentiment internally but was getting slightly irritated by Siegfried's repetitive complaints.

"Well, well, both of you, please calm down."

Miranda, who was accompanying them and preventing what seemed like an imminent argument, said.

Miranda had contributed significantly by devising a new battle tactic called "Jump Thrust" in the previous battle, which played a crucial role in subduing the disaster-class beings. She was now considered a valuable asset and spent more time with the two leaders as a chaperone.

Encouraged by Miranda's advice, Christina, who felt somewhat embarrassed, used Miranda's mature demeanor as an example to scold Siegfried.

"Look, Miranda is more mature, isn't she? As an instructor, you should..."

"Shh!"

As Christina began her lecture, Siegfried interrupted her with his hand.

"What's wrong? I'm not finished..."

"Shut up for a moment! Magic Corps! Can you feel it!?"

Christina thought her lecture had been cut short, but Siegfried's expression was serious, or rather, he looked downright terrifying.

The same was true for all the magic users in the Magic Corps.

"What... What is this?"

"Monsters? They're enormous even for disaster-class beings..."

It seemed like they were sensing some sort of magical power. A massive magical power that could still be detected from such a long distance.

It was apparently some kind of magical creature, but the magical power was greater than that of a disaster-class being.

Knights and soldiers who couldn't use detection magic were perplexed by the words of the magic users.

"Siegfried! Can you feel it!?"

"Captain... Isn't this bad?"

"Yeah, it's not just 'bad'..."

The Magic Corps captain, Luper, who had rushed to Siegfried, had a memory associated with this magical power.

"...It's the magical power of the demons?"

"Demons!?"

The people around them who had heard this word were shocked.

The astonishment spread rapidly throughout the entire Arlsheid army.

"But! There are only three reactions!?"

"I can't believe it, but..."

Luper voiced the worst-case scenario, one that was likely true.

"...Did they let them escape?"

"No way! Especially not Shin!"

Siegfried, who was well aware of Shin's exceptional abilities, couldn't imagine that Shin would let the demons escape after preparing the operation so meticulously.

"It's true that Walford is extraordinary, but we are indeed in this situation. Perhaps something irregular happened."

It was hard to believe, but the situation was real. Three demons were headed straight towards them.

No one wanted to believe it, but...

"Listen carefully, everyone! In the worst-case scenario, the demons have eluded Walford and are coming towards us!"

Using amplification magic to make his voice thunder throughout the entire army, Luper continued, "But we can't flee from here because..."

He paused and looked in the direction they had been marching.

In that direction...

"If we leave here, what's behind is the Kingdom of Arlsheid!"

Upon hearing those words, the Arlsheid army's bewildered and despairing expressions transformed into determined and resolute ones.

"We will defend this place at all costs! Risk your lives!!"

"Uooooo!!"

If they left this place, Arlsheid, their homeland where their families lived, would be attacked by demons. They wouldn't allow that to happen, and every member of the Arlsheid army let out a fierce battle cry.

Finally, the demons approached within visible range.

"Everyone, assume combat positions! They're coming!!"

And when the demons entered firing range...

"Fire!!"

A concentrated magical barrage from all the magicians belonging to the Arlsheid army was launched at the demons.

The demons, which had been approaching the Arlsheid army at high speed, couldn't afford to take such an attack head-on and altered their course to avoid it. The concentrated magical barrage from the entire magic corps of the Arlsheid army struck the location where the demons had been just moments ago, lifting a massive cloud of earth and debris.

As a result of the Magic Corps' magic converging at a single point, the power was so immense that it even altered the terrain.

The demons saw this spectacle, stopped in their tracks, and then...

"What!? They escaped!?"

It seemed they had finally judged the situation as too dangerous after witnessing the concentrated magical barrage from earlier. They stopped in their tracks, deviating from their course towards the Arlsheid army, and continued on, bypassing the Arlsheid army.

"This is bad! They're heading in the direction of the capital, aren't they? We need to chase them!"

"It's impossible, Captain! There's no way we can catch up to them! We should inform our homeland to be on high alert instead!"

Overwhelmed by surprise, Luper, who had just deactivated the amplification magic, suggested following them. However, the difference in speed between the demons and the Arlsheid army was too great. Chasing down the fast-moving demons with a force of tens of thousands was not a realistic option.

Siegfried advised that it was more important to use the communication device to contact Arlsheid's homeland and prepare for an attack.

"That's right. Dominic!"

"I understand! I'll go to the communication device at full speed with the fastest horse! Got it? Full speed!"

Dominic, who led the Knights, relayed the order for rapid communication using the fastest horse.

Luper, with a bitter expression, watched the direction where the demons had run off.

"Anyway, let's head back to Arlsheid. Even if we can't make it in time, we can't give up."

Luper had given orders after detecting the demons' magical power, but Dominic, the true commander, instructed them to return to Arlsheid.

"...No, we'll continue on this path."

"What did you say? Luper, what are you talking about..."

"We can't catch up to those demons even if we pursue them. But... Walford and the others have Gates. They will definitely protect Arlsheid."

Luper believed that it was more important to advance and continue their original mission of subduing the monsters and reuniting with the Alliance forces, rather than trying to chase the demons that couldn't be caught.

After some contemplation, Dominic made a decision.

"That's right... with our marching speed, it's not realistic to chase the demons. In that case, is our duty to believe in them and move forward?"

"Damn it! In the end, we're just relying on those kids! What are we doing!?"

Unable to stop the demons and unable to catch up with them, Luper clenched his teeth in frustration at his own powerlessness.

Using levitation magic, they were flying at high speed while chasing the demons, but they couldn't capture the demons at all.

Are they really ahead of us? Could they have changed their course along the way? Or was their initial direction incorrect?

Such doubts crossed their minds.

"Og! Are you sure this is the right way?"

"There's no way to know for sure!! Anyway, let's chase them at full speed for now!"

Og seemed quite anxious. This is not good. Honestly, I have confidence in my magical power, but I'm completely inexperienced in military operations like this. The Advanced Magic Academy doesn't teach tactics. Such knowledge is acquired after joining the military. Even in my previous life, I was quite ignorant of these matters.

In the Ultimate Magicians, Og has been deciding the direction of their actions, but with his current lack of composure, he might make a judgment error.

"Og! Just calm down for now! If needed, we can use the Gate to go to Arlsheid! It's not too late!"

"I understand! For now, we're chasing the demons!"

They thought they were heading straight in the direction where the demons were believed to have escaped.

Neither Og nor I were calm. Perhaps we failed to notice one particular discrepancy here. The fact that we haven't encountered the Arlsheid army. Regret over losing the demons. Impatience that they couldn't be found. Arlsheid is everyone's homeland, where they have family and friends, and precious people. The fear that Arlsheid might be attacked by demons. All of these emotions dominated our hearts, robbing us of our rational judgment.

If we had been calm, we would have noticed the fact that we hadn't encountered the Arlsheid army coming toward us. And to confirm whether or not they had encountered the demons, we would have looked for the Arlsheid army.

As I mentioned earlier, we have a Gate in the end, so it's not too late. However, in our state of panic, we completely failed to realize that.

"But still... Shin and the others haven't appeared."

"Maybe they've used the Gate to get ahead of us and go to Arlsheid."

After encountering the demons and letting them escape, the Arlsheid army continued to march, putting their faith in Shin and the others.

Some time had passed since the demons had appeared, but there was still no sign of Shin and the others. Siegfried was gradually becoming more worried.

"If by any chance, Shin and the others haven't realized that they let the demons escape..."

"Hey, Dominic! Send another messenger!"

"Got it!"

They decided to send another messenger to inform the Arlsheid army about the demons and their approach to Arlsheid, just in case Shin and the others hadn't realized they had lost the demons.

With this, even if they hadn't noticed the demons escaping, they should immediately head to Arlsheid via the Gate, at least that's what Siegfried and the others hoped for.

Already, the United Forces had moved on without Shin and the others, not knowing they were chasing the demons.

Continuing the fruitless pursuit of the demons.

They may have changed their direction along the way. However, no matter which route they take, they ultimately need to appear at the Arlsheid capital to make a comeback. Based on this judgment, they gave up the pursuit and used the Gate to move to the Arlsheid capital.

The arrived capital was in complete chaos.

"What... What's going on?"

Why is the capital in such an uproar?

"Oh, Your Majesty! Mr. Wolford!"

"Hey, what's happening? What's with all this commotion?"

Og questioned the soldier who had approached.

The soldier then gave a surprising answer.

"Earlier, we received a communication from the military units dispatched to the demon territory! They encountered the demons, engaged in battle, but the demons escaped and are heading towards Arlsheid!"

"What?! What are you saying?"

The Arlsheid army had encountered the demons?! Now that they thought about it, they hadn't come across the Arlsheid army! Does that mean they were pursuing in the wrong direction?

Damn it! They should have found them! Besides, the Arlsheid army, once they left Arlsheid, was initially advancing towards the old imperial capital before changing their direction to head to the town where the demons had gathered. In other words, the Arlsheid army was not in a direct line with both Arlsheid and the town.

There was no way they would cross paths with the Arlsheid army, which had aimed straight for Arlsheid.

"Dammit! Why does everything have to go wrong at the last moment like this?"

Og was regretting his own misjudgment, but there was no time for that now.

"Hey, what about the reserve corps?"

Not all of the troops in Arlsheid were participating in this operation. Some were stationed domestically, ready for contingencies. Og was checking on the deployment of the reserve corps.

"We determined the area where the demons are expected to appear based on the recent communication. We had the reserve corps stationed in that border region in advance, and we've contacted them via the communication device. It appears they are ready for interception!"

"Where is this border region?"

"It's a plain near the border, which served as a battlefield during the previous war with the Empire."

"The plain near the border..."

That's... bad...

"Has anyone been to that place?"

I know that location.

It has been a battlefield with the Empire several times in the past. We've learned about it in our classes. It doesn't have any specific features. That's why it's chosen as a battlefield, but being featureless...

"Damn, I haven't!"

"Uh, I haven't either..."

Og and Sicily responded apologetically.

The others also shook their heads.

Just as I thought!

Who would willingly go to a place with nothing special?

"The Gate is not an option! We're flying there again!"

"Okay!"

They decided to abandon using the Gate to the plain that nobody had visited and chose to fly there using levitation magic.

If they didn't hurry, the reserve corps and the demons might start clashing.

The demons were originally supposed to be our responsibility. Even with our increased strength, the burden was still heavy for our soldiers. We couldn't afford any more sacrifices.

Driven by this determination, we aimed for the plain near the border. When we finally saw the plain, we confirmed that the menacing magical energy of the demons was approaching the reserve corps.

"The demons' magical power!"

"Damn! We're about to make contact with the reserve corps!"

"We have to make it in time!"

I focused my attention on detecting the demons' magical energy. Because of that, I couldn't notice their presence.

But when I thought it was already too late...

I saw an immense column of fire rise, engulfing the demons' magical energy.

The reserve corps, who received a communication from the royal capital, felt a heavy atmosphere. The demons had slipped through the encirclement of Shin and Siegfried and were heading towards Arlsheid.

If Shin were to track the demons and catch up with them, that would be great. They could return to Arlsheid and receive a report, then request reinforcements to come here. However, even if they were to come from Arlsheid, it was too late for their arrival.

There was a concern that Shin and the others might not have realized that they had lost track of the demons. They might still be pursuing them and haven't shown up here yet. The anticipation and anxiety mixed together, making the atmosphere in the reserve corps heavy.

"Your Highness, you're late..."

"N-No, they're still pursuing them!"

"Your Highness, we hope they'll make it in time..."

"If only we had a wedding ceremony before the operation..."

"You... You didn't... You don't mean..."

"Yeah. I... I'll have a wedding after this operation is over."

"You idiot! What the hell have you done?"

His colleagues were amazed by how splendidly he had set up a death flag. It might have seemed like a joke, but they were deadly serious.

"Our deaths are pretty much a certainty now..."

"Sorry..."

I reiterate, they were absolutely serious. If Shin and the others could catch up, that would be great. However, if they didn't make it in time, their deaths were almost certain. It would be impossible not to think of death in any way. The atmosphere was heavy in the Arlsheid reserve corps.

Finally, a member of the mage division within the corps announced the arrival they had been waiting for.

"It's... It's here! I-it's... really... demons!"

Despite their fear of the overwhelmingly sinister magical power, the mage used amplification magic to shout so everyone could hear.

From their evident fear, they realized that Shin and the others hadn't sensed their magical power. And they hadn't come from the Arlsheid direction.

They didn't make it in time. Just when all the soldiers were on the verge of giving up, thinking it was the end of their lives...

"Well, well. They've arrived."

"What's going on? Is that really the demons? Their magical power seems a bit too weak, doesn't it?"

The tidings of salvation reached them. why popcorn pops
