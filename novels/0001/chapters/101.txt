A few days before the attack on Pope Ekaterina:

In the former imperial capital within the Demon Territory, Strom had summoned Zest, the head of his intelligence division, for a conversation.

"It seems that various things are in motion."

"I apologize for any inconvenience, my lord. I hoped to find something that could serve as a guideline for your actions, which led me to my recent activities."

"I see. I appreciate your efforts. However, it might be time to put an end to that."

"What do you mean?"

"The results of Milia's experiment have been promising."

"That...?"

Upon hearing this, Zest became tense. After hearing about Strom's past, Milia had proposed an experiment with potentially significant implications for the future of their kind. The first phase of the experiment had been successful, and they were waiting for the results.

"What are the results..."

Zest waited anxiously for the continuation of Strom's words.

From Deseum, a message had come in that Pope Ekaterina had been stabbed with a poisoned blade and, due to the nature of the poison, was beyond the reach of healing. They requested aid from Shin. Around the time Shin, accompanied by Merlin, had left for East, August and the others who had seen him off had grave expressions on their faces.

"Will Shin-dono make it in time?"

Thor's worried words reflected the inner thoughts of everyone.

"That guy, as long as he's alive, he'll probably find a way to fix it. The question is whether he'll make it in time..."

The trust in Shin among the people here was substantial. They believed in him without a doubt, knowing that he could use healing magic to save anyone except the deceased. So, they often told him not to die.

As long as you're not dead, they had faith that he'd somehow make it. Everyone present here, regardless of their personal level of devotion, were followers of the Creator's faith.

Therefore, they fervently wished for him to arrive in time while there was still life left.

At that moment, August's wireless communicator's bell rang once more.

"Hello! Shin, is that you? What happened?"

Although he had only recently left for East through the gate, August feared the worst when he received this call. He shouted anxiously into the communicator.

"Sorry, August. It's not Shin."

"Oh, Your Majesty, it's you. My apologies for yelling."

"No need to apologize. I can see that your concern is for Ekaterina's well-being. But there's a serious situation at hand."

The King of the great nation of Arsheid Kingdom referred to the situation as "serious."

August felt a chill run down his spine upon hearing these words.

"What do you mean by a 'serious situation'?"

"I'm sorry, but I need you to head to the front lines as soon as possible."

"The front lines?"

"Yes, the front lines. A calamity-class monster has appeared!"

"What!? A calamity-class monster!?"

Calamity-class monsters, which had appeared less frequently after the number of demons decreased, were now showing up. This contradicted what had been believed, and August couldn't help but wonder if there was a mistake.

However, a calamity-class monster had appeared in reality now. There was no time to regret any oversight.

"Understood! I will head there immediately!"

"Please, do it. Move as close as you can to the front lines via the gate with a carriage. Is Mark Bean there?"

"Mark? Father has requested you!"

"Father!?"

"It's an emergency! Hurry up!"

"Y-Yes! Got it! I've taken over! M-Mark Bean here!"

"Mark! Is Bean Workshop currently producing the carriage itself?"

Diessel knew that Bean Workshop only manufactured and sold carriage components to avoid market confusion. But he had a certain conviction.

"Y-Yes! At Wolforde's request, we've made a larger one!"

"I see, just as I suspected. By the command of King Arsheid, Diessel orders you: use that carriage to send the Ultimate Magicians to the front lines. I'll inform Shin. Understand?"

"Y-Yes!"

Diesel was convinced that Shin must have used this technology to build a carriage for himself. So, using Shin's carriage for these orders was decided in advance.

"Understood!"

"Alright! Go!"

With these words, the communication from Diesel was cut off.

"Your Highness!"

"I could hear Father's voice! Let's head to the workshop immediately!"

"Of course!"

Mark, who lived at the workshop, opened the gate, and everyone hurried to the workshop. Inside the workshop, a newly finished carriage was placed.

"Dad!"

"What the hell, you idiot! In the workshop, you're supposed to call me Master, right?"

Yelling loudly, Mark called the workshop's owner, who was standing near the carriage.

"We don't have time for that! Is Wolforde's carriage ready yet?"

"Huh? Oh, yeah, it's ready to be delivered anytime."

"It's a royal order! We're using that carriage!"

"A royal order!?"

Shin had commissioned it from Bean Workshop, where it was entirely self-made from start to finish. Since he was the one using it, he didn't hold back on adding various features. If someone asked why Shin, who could use floating magic and gates, needed such a carriage, the answer was simple: it was part of his enjoyment to have various functions during his travels. Plus, the weakness men had for the latest models.

To use such a reckless carriage by royal order was a shock to Harold Bean, the owner of Bean Workshop.

"Sorry, I don't have time to explain! I'll talk to Shin about the situation later. The horses?"

"Y-Yes, if our horses are suitable..."

To the bewildered Harold, August instructed him to prepare horses. The workshop had carriages for delivering the workshop's products, and while they weren't anything extraordinary, they also had horses. By the way, these horses were the same ones that pulled the carriage for testing Shin's carriage.

"At this point, it doesn't matter! Equip them with all the recovery gear you have! Hurry!"

"S-Sure! Hey, you guys! Quickly attach the gear to the horses!"

"Yes, sir!"

Upon August's urgent command, the workshop's craftsmen quickly attached the gear to the horses, and the preparations for departure were completed in no time.

"Don't push yourself too hard! Mark, please! Everyone get on the carriage! We're leaving right now!"

"Yes!"

August instructed Mark, who was likely familiar with driving this carriage, to sit on the driver's seat, and the rest to get into the passenger carriage. They opened a gate to a location they had been to before within the territory of the demons, which was also a known point on the front lines where the Aarsheid Kingdom's forces and the coalition forces from various countries were dealing with a disaster-level creature.

"Mark, go!"

"Understood!"

At August's command, Mark immediately drove the carriage toward the gate. The craftsmen from Bean Workshop who had suddenly appeared and disappeared left everyone in a state of shock.

"The Ultimate Magicians are all mobilizing? And in such a hurry... What on earth has happened..."

Harold's muttered words echoed the concerns shared by everyone present. They were all deeply troubled by the fact that the invincible group was in such a rush.

The carriage that emerged from the gate was heading straight for the front lines where a surveillance network was in place.

"Please don't stick your faces out of the windows! It's dangerous!"

Mark, driving the carriage from the driver's seat while imbuing the harness with magic, warned the passengers in the rear carriage. There was a good reason for his warning.

"Wow... Is this really a carriage?"

"The scenery outside the window... It's passing by at a speed I've never seen before..."

"Despite that, it's not shaking much, huh?"

"This is Shin's developed carriage... He's created something outrageous again..."

The reason for their astonishment was that this carriage was running at a speed unlike anything they'd experienced before.

Maria let out a surprised voice, Julius was in shock at the unusually high speed of the passing scenery, and Thor questioned why there was so little shaking despite the speed.

August, on the other hand, sighed, not knowing whether to be amazed or angry at Shin for creating something extraordinary once again.

"But, thanks to Shin's carriage, we'll get to the scene very quickly."

Cecily defended Shin's position as her fianc√©. And in fact, that was true.

"Indeed... this time we might have been saved by Shin..."

"Hey, there's a refrigerator!"

August and his group didn't have access to floating magic.

As a result, the time it would have taken them to reach the scene had been significantly reduced thanks to Shin's developed carriage.

August thought that they had been saved by this fact, but when Alice discovered the presence of a refrigerator, a twitching sensation began at his temple.

"Plus, this sofa is so comfy."

"Inside the carriage is bright, and if it weren't for the fact that we're heading to the front lines of a battlefield, it would feel like we're in a resort carriage."

"The temperature is so comfortable. You never seem to hold back when it comes to yourself."

As Lynn pointed out, they had a cushy sofa to sit on. It was probably using magic stones, as the lamp Tony had mentioned was constantly lit. The interior maintained a comfortable temperature, even in this season, which, while it was spring, still felt a bit chilly. It was undoubtedly adjusted by magic stones.

Just how much technology had been packed into this carriage? They weren't selling it, but the audacity to go to such lengths left August flabbergasted.

"Sigh... Well, at least we won't exhaust ourselves before we arrive at the scene."

Normally, he would be shouting at Shin to be more responsible, but this time he decided to be lenient. This was primarily due to the emergency situation. Thanks to this carriage, they were likely to arrive in perfect condition at the scene. And...

"But Shin-kun will be disappointed. He was looking forward to the completion of this carriage."

When Cecily said this with a worried expression, August chuckled. Yes, he had been quietly thinking that he should refrain from scolding Shin too harshly because, despite Shin's anticipation, they were the first ones to ride the special carriage he had created.

By the way, what about Mark, who was at the driver's seat, who was said to be not consuming energy? In fact, in addition to the luxurious and comfortable passenger compartment, consideration had been given to the high-speed driver's seat.

Unlike automobiles, the driver's seat of a horse-drawn carriage is open. When running at high speeds, it would be exposed to substantial wind. Surprisingly, the human body depletes a significant amount of energy when exposed to strong winds for an extended period.

Therefore, the area around the driver's seat activated wind magic to prevent the driver from expending energy. Naturally, this was also maintained with a continuous supply of magical power from the magic stones. All this for a carriage that was running continuously at speeds of about 60 kilometers per hour.

Normally, horses couldn't run at this speed while pulling a carriage, but this carriage had power assistance. Furthermore, it was running at a speed unimaginable in this world, not to mention Shin's past life.

Inside, there were curtains to separate the space, and everyone except Mark had changed into combat outfits.

After a few dozen minutes of travel, the front lines they were aiming for came into view.

"Your Highness! It's coming into view!"

"Good! Everyone, prepare for battle! Mark, once you stop the carriage, change into your gear and then put the carriage into the dimensional storage and join us!"

"Uh, what about the horses?"

"Sorry, but we can't afford to dote on them. If they survive, we'll bring them back. If they run away or get hurt in battle... well, the royal family will compensate you later. Sorry."

"...Understood."

"...Sorry. These are your family's horses. I understand you must be attached to them, but..."

"No, it's an emergency. If they become sacrifices for that, I accept it willingly."

"I'm sorry... and the rest of you, I apologize for putting you in this situation due to human convenience."

Shin's created carriage could be stored in a dimensional space, but living creatures couldn't. August apologized to Mark, the horses, and even the group, as they might end up causing these horses to die for their convenience.

"Your Highness... you're being too considerate."

"No, we should protect these horses from harm just like we protect ourselves. But more importantly, we're almost there!"

The front lines were rapidly approaching. Following August's words, everyone climbed to the roof of the carriage.

"Jet boots, activate! Let's go!"

"Alright!"

"I'll be there soon!"

Everyone except Mark, who was still dressing in his combat attire, used their jet boots and quite literally flew towards the front lines where the so-called 'disaster-class magical creatures' had engaged once again, an unprecedented opponent.

Then, they stopped the carriage. Mark, now dressed in his combat attire, disconnected the horses from the carriage and stored the carriage in a dimensional space.

And...

"You all, make sure you survive."

With those words, he smacked the horses' behinds, prompting them to run away from this place.

"I'll come to get you later."

Mark said this and then activated his jet boots, racing towards the battlefield.

The frontline just before August and the others arrived.

At one of the locations where the Aarlsheid army had set up their positions, there was an observation tower. From there, soldiers were looking through telescopes with farsight magic enhancements.

"Today too, no abnormalities in the Magic City..."

The former imperial capital occupied by the magical beings in the magical territory. Among the soldiers, the term 'Magic City' had become commonplace. The Magic City could not be seen with the naked eye from the front lines where this surveillance network was established. A surveillance network had been set up at a position where it was just possible to see through the use of tools equipped with farsight magic.

This conclusion had been reached as the best method to conduct surveillance without provoking Strom and his allies, and as a result, monitoring was conducted from these positions. They had marched to this position a few days ago and established their formation here, enabling the combined forces of various countries to communicate. With the surveillance network now complete, they only had to monitor the Magic City and communicate if any irregularities occurred. To ensure that the Ultimate Magicians could rush to the location upon receiving the call, they needed them to visit this place later. However, the soldiers had a baseless belief that such a situation wouldn't arise immediately.

This might be a reasonable assumption. After defeating the magical beings that attacked various countries, no disaster-class magical creatures had appeared, and they had been able to advance smoothly until this point. As the initial tension faded and the operation progressed smoothly, the soldiers began to believe that this operation could conclude without issues.

While looking through the farsight magical tool with these thoughts in mind, one of the soldiers noticed something.

"Huh? The gate of the Magic City's wall is open?"

"What?"

One of the soldiers responsible for monitoring spotted that the gate in the walls surrounding the Magic City was open and muttered his surprise, which caught the ear of another soldier. The soldier who heard about the anomaly also peered through the farsight magical tool to confirm the situation.

"Indeed... wasn't it closed just a moment ago?"

"Yeah... what's going on?"

The soldier who had spoken this far held his breath because the gate was now wide open. The reason being, from the inside of the gate, an enormous horde of magical creatures had emerged.

"A ma-ma-massive horde of magical creatures..."

The soldier couldn't believe his eyes because the magical creatures that had come out were...

"Huh? Is my eyesight playing tricks on me? They all look as big as disaster-class creatures..."

"No... It looks the same to me."

The fact that there were only disaster-class creatures had them convinced. The sentinel soldiers who were both certain they were seeing the same thing shouted to the soldier below the observation tower.

"A large number of disaster-class creatures have emerged from the Magic City! Relay this to all the forces immediately! It's an emergency!!"

The soldier who had made this announcement froze for a moment under the observation tower, but then snapped back to his senses and sprinted toward the canopy where the communication device was placed.

And so, it was reported to various countries and brought to August's attention via Deceum that a large number of disaster-class creatures had appeared from the Magic City.

"Darn it! Your Highness and the others haven't visited this place yet! The rescue won't make it in time!"

They had made contact, but how long would it take for the Ultimate Magicians in the Aarlsheid royal capital to reach here? While they had managed to handle a disaster-class creature on their own, the number of these creatures emerging from the Magic City was in the dozens.

To be blunt, this wasn't just an emergency; it was an abnormal situation. Could they really halt the advance of these creatures? More importantly, could they survive?

The soldiers began preparing for combat with a sense of impending despair.

Then, a few dozen minutes after the emergency was reported, the creatures, which hadn't arrived immediately due to the distance from the Magic City, finally entered their field of view.

"W-what's that..."

The soldiers stationed in front of the defensive wall of their encampment, constructed by earth magic, were left dumbfounded when they saw the approaching horde of creatures.

Among them were the classic disaster-class creatures like tigers, lions, and bears. There were also wolves, which rarely reached disaster-class status, a deer reported for the first time recently, unbelievably large boars, rhinos, and even originally large elephants, all transformed into disaster-class creatures.

"W-what is this...?"

"You idiots! This is not the time to be in shock! Magic Division, unleash your magic with all your might! Knight Division, charge with all your might!"

"Aaaargh!"

In response to the nearly surreal and despairing sight, the soldiers raised their voices in half desperation.

"Fire it!"

Upon the commander's command, the magic unleashed by the Magic Division soldiers in unison. During the over half a year of marching, the Magic Division had never neglected their magic control training. Their magic was faster and more powerful than ever before.

And then, the magic struck the horde of creatures, causing a spectacular explosion.

However, their opponents were disaster-class creatures.

No one among the soldiers believed they could be taken down that easily.

"Knight Division! Activate your Jet Boots!"

As the smoke cleared from the impact of the magic, the Knight Division advanced.

And then...

"Charge!"

The Knight Division activated their Jet Boots and leaped at the creatures that were revealed as the smoke dissipated.

Among them were the creatures that had taken damage from the advanced magic, even though they couldn't be defeated in a single blow. The knights went after these weakened creatures.

"Don't linger in one place! Once you've inflicted some damage, disengage!"

They strictly adhered to hit-and-run tactics, damaging the creatures and then retreating, repeating this process.

Perhaps due to the success of this tactic, they managed to take down a few creatures that had charged at them.

However...

"Dammit! There are too many of them!"

The numbers were extraordinary.

Furthermore, they had all turned into disaster-class creatures, their bodies enlarged.

The blood and flesh of the giant creatures they defeated were quickly replaced by even larger ones surging forward.

The scene was like a depiction of hell.

Despite the coordination between the Knight Division and the Magic Division, the soldiers were gradually being pushed back.

Soldiers who had seen little combat casualties before were now mass-produced in a matter of seconds.

"Dammit! So close!"

A soldier who was watching the collapsing frontline with a bitter expression involuntarily shouted.

The timing couldn't have been worse.

Despite having the surveillance network set up, it was all in vain without the Ultimate Magicians here.

Nobody had imagined that a crisis like this would arise before that arrangement could be made.

In this situation, they were determined to take as many creatures down with them as possible.

It was at that moment, with that determination, that...

Their field of vision suddenly went completely white.

And then...

A massive lightning bolt, accompanied by a thunderous roar, struck the creatures.

Startled by this sudden event, the soldiers, once their vision had returned, looked around...

They witnessed a scene where the creatures that had been attacking them just moments ago were lying scorched and defeated.

A massive lightning strike.

The power to slay disaster-class creatures in a single blow.

Only one person could wield such an extraordinary magic, and the soldiers looked back with hopeful expectations.

What they saw was...

"Soldiers, sorry for the delay! Leave the rest to us!"

Adorned in lightning, standing atop the defensive wall, it was Crown Prince Augustus and the Ultimate Magicians.
