After the exclusive head of state conference dominated by Grandma came to an end, we returned home after seeing off the heads of state from various countries using the magic gate. The heads of state seemed to be quite impressed with the magic used by the gate for their transportation, except for King Daam, who had been very suspicious throughout, muttering about how it made it too easy for us to attack. I wish he would understand that we have no intention of attacking. Moreover, since only we can use the gate, if someone were to attack using it, it would be clear immediately that it was us. Such a foolish act would never happen.

"Sigh... I'm tired..."

"Come to think of it, isn't this the first time you've been met with such direct hostility?"

"Actually, now that you mention it..."

I breathed a sigh of exhaustion as soon as we got back home. Grandma mentioned that she couldn't recall the last time I had been directly confronted like that. Although there were things said about me during the meetings I wasn't present for, it was indeed the first time I had been directly challenged. Everyone's overwhelming praise and support had possibly made me a bit overconfident.

"What's wrong? Is there something you're not telling us?"

I was addressed by Grandpa, who had been listening to Grandma and me. I hesitated about whether to speak since I didn't want to worry him, but Grandma explained everything to Grandpa.

"I see..."

"Oh, don't be so heartless! How can you say such things about Shin?!"

Comparatively more understanding than usual, Grandpa simply nodded. However, Sicily, who was home today, was in a state of indignation.

"Shin is doing his best to make his incredible power useful to humanity!"

Tears welled up in her eyes, and she was clearly angry on my behalf. While I appreciated Sicily's attitude, I didn't want to see her continue to be so angry. So, I sat down beside her on the couch and gently stroked her head to console her.

"Ugh..."

Perhaps being comforted by the head pat, she settled down somewhat, and her voice softened. Yet, she was still quite angry. Seeing Sicily in this state, Grandpa, as if advising her, spoke:

"Sicily, it's extremely heartwarming that you're getting angry for Shin's sake. But you must understand that this was something that could be expected to a certain extent."

"Expected, you say?"

"Yes. How does Shin's presence look to you from your perspective, Sicily?"

"Eh!? W-Well... he's strong, kind, handsome, dependable, and then..."

"No, no. I meant more in the sense of how you see Shin's magic and creations, his magical tools..."

"Oh, I see!"

Misunderstanding Grandpa's question, Sicily blushed.

"Y-yes, well... I often come up with things that no one else would even think of, so I think it's amazing..."

"Hmm. Probably, anyone close to Shin might think that way. Especially Sicily, your feelings for Shin seem exceptionally strong."

"Ugh..."

"Ho ho, that's a good thing. But, well..."

Grandpa, who appeared satisfied as he watched Sicily blush, interrupted.

"For someone who doesn't know Shin well, can they imagine how his extraordinary power might appear to them?"

"W-Well..."

Grandpa's slightly mischievous question left Sicily at a loss for words.

"It's okay when he's an ally, but there are those who will imagine it differently if he becomes an enemy... Unfortunately, it's bound to happen."

"N-No!"

"That's how it goes. History has proven it."

"...Everyone is so cruel. There's absolutely no way Shin would ever turn against you all..."

She was clearly frustrated, her tears on the verge of spilling.

"We understand that, we really do. That's why we gave him a firm response. But..."

In fact, Grandma had done just that with the national leaders present.

Even I found it hard to believe.

But still, Grandma's words remained somewhat vague.

"Once suspicions like that take root, they're not easily erased. That King of Daam, he better not be thinking anything strange..."

Her words silenced everyone.

The way he had left still didn't sit right.

I had a feeling that even if our duel with this magical being ended in our victory, there might still be some complications.

For example...

"What if they managed to replicate the Vibration Sword?"

Investigating the properties of the Vibration Sword, and the concern that it might be duplicated, had started to nag at me. I never expected someone would have such a reaction, and it was making me more and more worried.

When I voiced this concern, Grandma shot me a thoroughly exasperated look. "Firstly, it's futile to worry like this when we don't even understand the principles of how to produce those ultra-high-speed and fine vibrations. Isn't that so?"

"Is that true?"

"Yeah. Seriously, I wonder where you've picked up such knowledge from."

I see. There is no knowledge of ultrasound in this world. So, the worry about the Vibration Sword being replicated might be unfounded. After all, when it comes to magical tools, you can mimic them, but copying is a different story.

Huh? Wait a second. Copying is impossible?

In that case, there's one magical tool I just can't come to terms with.

"Hey, Grandma."

"What's up?"

"Who makes the Citizen's Cards?"

The Citizen's Card, the world's perfect identification, which cannot be activated by anyone other than the one recognized by its magic.

Who would be responsible for creating such a remarkable magical tool?

When I first acquired the Citizen's Card, I didn't yet know the typical level of a modern magical tool artisan. Grandma had been in retirement, and I had assumed that active magical tool artisans had even more advanced skills, and they would be responsible for such things.

However, the reality was that Grandma was still the top magical tool artisan. The other magical tool artisans couldn't surpass her, and their skills had reached a plateau.

In the current situation, how were such high-performance magical tools being created?

When I asked this question, Grandma looked a bit perplexed.

"The Citizen's Cards... well, they are made using lost technology. So, how are they made? I can only say 'I don't know' if asked that."

"Lost technology?"

"Yeah, the Citizen's Card is quite high-performance compared to other magical tools, isn't it?"

"You're right."

It served not only as an identification but also recorded monster subjugation records and managed bank accounts. I had a memory of how impressive the technology was.

"About two hundred years ago. In a small country, there was a genius magical tool artisan."

"Hmm? This story sounds somewhat familiar..."

"Could it be, Grandma, are you talking about the story of the genius magical tool artisan Massita?"

"Ah, yes! I read about it in a book Tom brought me when I was a child!"

There once existed a genius magical tool artisan named Korno Massita. His achievements became a part of folklore and served as a model for picture books and fairy tales. I, too, read about it when I was young to learn the letters of this world.

But why is she bringing up this story now?

"The Citizen's Card, you see, is a magical tool created by Massita."

"What!?"

That's ridiculous! Even if it was developed by a genius magical tool artisan, someone should be needed to imbue the magic into the Citizen's Cards nowadays.

Could it be...?

"Is Massita still alive, by any chance?"

"What nonsense are you talking about? There's no way that's possible."

"Then, what does it mean?"

I thought that perhaps Massita is still alive, continuing to imbue the Citizen's Cards. But if that were the case, he'd be over two hundred years old. That can't be right. So, who is doing the imbuing?

"Every magical tool created by Massita was truly exceptional. However, there was one problem."

"I know that."

"I know too. It was... "

Yes, this is another well-known story.

" 'The imbuing technique was too specialized, and no one could succeed it.' "

"That's correct."

This is why Massita's story has been passed down as folklore rather than a biography. Some even doubt if he ever truly existed.

"Among the magical tools made by Massita, there was something truly remarkable without danger. That's why Massita, who had been concerned that his creations might endanger the world, finally decided to accept numerous requests from countries and cities all over the world for the first time, as he'd made an invention that could benefit society."

"The Citizen's Card is primarily managed by the central government, so there's no worry of it disrupting the economic balance."

"But, it's a concern that as long as Massita lives, humans will continue to increase, even after he's gone. He worried about this and created something."

"Something?"

"An automatic magic imbuing device for the Citizen's Card."

"An automatic magic imbuing device!?"

What on earth is that!? Two hundred years ago!? This is practically over-the-top technology!

"He mass-produced those automatic imbuing devices and distributed them to various countries. That's how the Citizen's Cards are still being made. However, since Massita ultimately passed away, keeping the details of the automatic magic imbuing device a secret, it remains a somewhat unknown technology."

"But if one of those devices breaks..."

"In the past, there have been instances where they were damaged, stolen, or destroyed a few times. In such cases, people from cities without a working automatic magic imbuing device need to travel to neighboring towns to obtain new Citizen's Cards, so it can take some time for reissuance in cities with damaged devices."

I see.

I had no idea there was such a story about the Citizen's Cards.

"Did you know, Sisily?"

"No... It's the first time I've heard of this. Actually, I've heard that none of Massita's magical tools remain..."

"I read about it in a book. I never thought it was this close to home."

The inventor of the Citizen's Card, who Sisily didn't know.

It seems like this isn't common knowledge, not only to someone like me who grew up in the mountains.

"By the way, Grandma, how do you know about this story?"

"I was originally a magical tool artisan, you know? It's only natural for me to research past genius magical tool artisans."

"It was tough, let me tell you. If there was any hint of information about Massita, I would even venture into warring nations during those times..."

"Ha! During a war, could anything stop my thirst for knowledge?"

"Grandma, during a war?"

"Yes, Massita's birthplace was being invaded by the Empire at the time. They were right in the midst of a war."

Going to a war-torn country, even during a war! Unbelievable, as usual.

And, for some reason, when Sisily heard this story, she's chuckling.

"What's wrong, Sisily?"

"Nothing. I just remembered how you look so much like your grandpa, even though you're not related, as your grandma said before."

"Oh, that's right."

"Listening to this story now, I can see the resemblance between you and your grandma."

"Resemblance?"

Where, exactly?

"That thirst for knowledge, the drive to charge forward even in the midst of war... After all, Shin, you must have grown up looking at both of them."

She's looking at me and Grandma with a heartwarming gaze.

What's with that? It's embarrassing.

"What's wrong? You seem to resemble only the parts you wouldn't want to."

"Ha-ha, not very candid, are you?"

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Well..."

Even Grandma is blushing.

Her attempt at diversion is quite powerful.

She successfully dodges Grandpa's teasing.

"Now then, because of these circumstances, the Citizen's Card is made with the automatic magic imbuing devices, so I don't know the details."

Is that so?

Well, I wasn't particularly eager to solve the mystery of the Citizen's Card, so it's fine.

I was just curious, and now I understand what the Citizen's Card is.

"When you think about it, Shin's most commendable invention is probably the circuit that connects the imbued magic. You haven't been doing magic imbuing at Bean's Workshop recently, right?"

"Yeah, if I did it all by myself, it would take all day, no matter how much time I had."

If I did all that imbuing by myself, it would take an entire day. So, I wanted to avoid that, and I invented a circuit that could produce the same effect as me imbuing the magic, even in this world's language.

Thanks to it, magic imbuing at Bean's Workshop can be done without me.

"That's great. After you invented that circuit, others can do the magic imbuing that only you could do before. And everyone's started to get creative. This is something to be proud of."

Wow, praise from Grandma, who doesn't praise often.

I'm happy, but it's embarrassing.

For some reason, feeling self-conscious, I cast my gaze down at the Citizen's Card.

The object that I had always taken for granted suddenly looked different.

I never thought that something so incredibly close by was created by the genius magical tool artisan from a fairy tale.

In that case, even though I never checked it out before, maybe I should look into it now?

There might be a glimpse of the legendary technique.

As I contemplated this, Grandma seemed to find it suspicious.

"Shin. You..."

"Huh?"

"Shin, Lady Miranda from the Knight Academy has arrived."

Just as Grandma seemed to be getting suspicious, the head maid, Marika, came to announce a visitor.

"Please, let them in."

"Yes, ma'am."

"Miranda? That girl who became Michel's apprentice?"

It seems like I successfully diverted Grandma's attention. I don't know why Miranda is here, but her timing is excellent.

As I waited in the living room, Miranda, accompanied by one of the maids, entered the room.

"Ah, Master Merlin, Lady Merida. I apologize for this sudden visit today."

"Ho-ho, you're Shin and Sicily's friend, no need to worry."

"That's right. By the way, what brings you here today?"

"Oh! I almost forgot to get to the main point while greeting you!"

With these words, Miranda, who had been greeting Grandpa and Grandma, shifted her gaze to me.

Her expression changed completely from the cheerful one directed at Grandpa and Grandma. It became a fierce, almost wrathful face, like a demon, which was quite different.

"Just now, I was told by the Royal Castle that I should become an instructor for the Allied Forces!? Why on earth does a student like me who hasn't even become a knight yet have to be an instructor!?"

"Oh, they already informed you, huh? Uncle Dis works fast."

It's only been a short time since the meeting ended, and they've already contacted her.

"Fast at work... No, that's not it! The Allied Forces?! A proper military officer?! Why should I, who is still a student and not even a knight, be an instructor!?"

"Why, you ask... it's because you, Tony, and I are the only ones who use the Vibration Swords."

"Everyone is still a student!?"

We're not going to teach swordsmanship. If anything, we should be the ones receiving instruction. But this time, it's...

"The job this time is just teaching how to use the Vibration Sword."

"The problem is the person I have to teach it to!"

Hmm, Miranda seems to be quite emotionally unstable.

"Sicily! Say something too!"

"Even if you tell me to say something... it seems like it's already a done deal in Shin's mind, so... Is there anything I can do?"

"I was stupid to ask you, who's in love with your husband!"

"Husband...?"

"Not that! There's more to it!"

Oh? The exchange between Sicily and Miranda feels quite friendly.

"Sicily, when did you become friends with Miranda?"

"Miranda is quite close to Maria, isn't she? She often comes over to Maria's house. Since my house is right next door, we started meeting each other often."

"I see."

"The three of us have sleepovers too... Haha, Miranda might seem tough, but her pajamas are actually cute..."

"Hey, don't embarrass me like that!"

"Haha, sorry about that."

It's unusual to see Sicily talking like this with someone other than Maria.

When I first met Miranda, I wondered how to interact with her, but it's nice to see Sicily and Maria getting along with her.

"Well, you don't have to think too much about it. You're not teaching swordsmanship. You're just teaching the tips for using the magical tools."

"Ugh... the pressure is making my stomach..."

"Stomach ache? Should I use healing magic on you?"

"It's not that kind of stomachache!"

The unique banter between Sicily and Miranda is quite entertaining. The serious atmosphere that filled the living room earlier is quickly replaced by laughter.

Miranda's abrupt visit and her subsequent outburst seem to be a result of her feeling overwhelmed by the sudden responsibility she was given. She had said that it was a heavy burden for her. However, we managed to persuade her, mentioning that both Tony and I would be doing it together, and she left with a hint of melancholy in her departure.

Speaking of which, it seems that Miranda and Tony have known each other for a long time. I was surprised to learn that she's attending the Magic Academy rather than the Knight Academy.

Tony is surprisingly competent. After Miranda left, Sicily also returned home, leaving me alone in the room.

In fact, there was something I wanted to try in my empty room. That is... to check the characters engraved on the Citizen's Card.

Unauthorized modification of the Citizen's Card is a serious crime, but just checking the characters... that should be fine, right?

I made up that excuse and immediately made the characters engraved on the Citizen's Card appear.

Then... "Wha... is this for real?"

Upon seeing the characters that appeared, I couldn't believe my eyes.

I rubbed my eyes, checked over and over again, thinking it might be a mistake.

But there was no mistake. I couldn't hide my astonishment because the characters that appeared there were... "Japanese."

Yes, they were in Japanese.
