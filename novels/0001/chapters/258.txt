"Based on the testimony so far, I believe it's safe to say that the intermediary merchant is from Darm. However, we can't trace their whereabouts from there."

"I see."

We can't pinpoint the whereabouts of the Darm-born intermediary. So, we need as much information as possible.

"And, Og wants to talk to Alma."

"If she's truly involved, she won't talk willingly. But we have this."

Og said this while taking out a pendant.

"You... are you going to use that?"

The pendant Og has is for confessions. It doesn't allow anything but the truth to be spoken while wearing it. It's a very convenient magical tool, but every human has a thing or two they want to keep secret. So, Og promised to use this magical tool only during criminal investigations.

This time, Alma is suspicious, but there's no concrete evidence. To use this magical tool on someone like that...

"Of course, I'll explain it beforehand. Whether she wears it or not is up to her. We can also have a witness present, besides me. How does that sound?"

"...Well, in that case."

Is that okay?

Well, to clear Alma's suspicion, we have no choice but to have her speak the truth from her own mouth. And to give credibility to that testimony, this magical tool is the best option.

"Understood. Then, I'll be present as well, and since Alma is a woman, let's have Katarina and Maria there just in case. Is that fine?"

When I said that, Og untied his arms and stood up.

"Yeah, that's fine. Well then, let's call Bietti, Arenas, and Messina right away."

Og said that and left the room to call the three.

...So the Crown Prince himself does such things, huh.

Is it because we're here, or is it because he no longer cares about such matters when we're around? I wonder which it is.

As I pondered such trivial matters while waiting in the room, Og returned.

"Hey, why are you lounging in the room?"

He immediately said that upon returning.

"Huh? Well, you were in a hurry to leave, so I thought you'd bring them here."

"Well, never mind. All three of you, come in."

Perhaps recalling his own actions, Og grimaced as if he were about to click his tongue, then addressed the three people behind him.

"Excuse me!"

"We're sorry..."

"Your Highness, what's going on? Please state your business quickly!"

While Alma seemed extremely tense, Katarina appeared timid, and Maria seemed rather unhappy.

"Alright, please have a seat. Bietti, sit there, Arenas and Messina, sit there."

Og had Alma sit in front of him and placed Katarina and Maria to her sides.

I sat in front of Maria and Katarina.

"I apologize for bringing you here so suddenly. Before we start the conversation, I want you to make a promise."

Og said this, then looked at Alma and Katarina among the three he had brought along.

"The content of the upcoming discussion is classified, and you must not divulge it to anyone. If it leaks from any source, we'll have to impose penalties. Do you understand?"

As Og spoke, Alma and Katarina, though pale, nodded vigorously.

The other Maria, who had been brought in, seemed quite accustomed to this.

"Another classified matter, huh? Sometimes, Your Highness, there are so many classified matters that I can't keep track of what's what."

Yeah, she's a bit too used to this.

It seemed that Og shared the same sentiment as he placed his hand on his forehead.

"Maria, you need to be extremely careful. Even someone like you could face penalties if you accidentally reveal classified information, you know?"

Well, I think we're fine since we don't interact with civilians outside of missions.

But accidents can happen.

"Penalties...? By the way, Your Highness, what kind of punishment would be imposed if you had to do so?"

Og thought for a moment in response to Maria's question, then answered.

"Well, for example... you'd have to spend an extended period in a convent..."

"I absolutely won't leak anything!"

"I-I see."

It seems Maria was scared by the punishment Og mentioned and interrupted him to declare her commitment to keeping the classified information secret.

She must have really disliked the idea.

Anyway, now that Maria had also agreed, Og began speaking to Alma.

"First, let's talk about the recent attempted assassination on Ellie."

Og said that and looked at the three women.

"The culprit has already been apprehended."

Upon hearing these words, Alma and Katarina wore pleased expressions, while Maria seemed genuinely relieved.

Maria being Ellie's friend, it made sense for her to react this way. The other two, who didn't personally know Og's wife, might have had some concerns, but not to the extent of Maria's.

Observing their expressions, I began to think that maybe Alma had nothing to do with it, and Og continued speaking.

"We haven't made this public because we haven't arrested all the culprits yet."

Upon hearing this, the three of them widened their eyes in surprise.

"Huh? Weren't there multiple culprits?"

Alma and Katarina seemed too hesitant to ask questions, so Maria spoke on their behalf.

"Right. At the very least, there's the mastermind, the intermediary, and the executor. We've already arrested the executor and the mastermind, but..."

"The intermediary is still at large, is that it?"

Maria's face briefly showed understanding after Og's explanation, but then she seemed to realize something.

"So, what does this have to do with us being called here?"

Well, if they haven't been told anything, it's a natural question.

"Actually..."

Og began to explain the matter concerning the intermediary that we had thought about together.

At first, the three of them seemed intrigued, but gradually, one of them's expression changed.

It was Alma.

This change began around the time Og explained the high likelihood that the culprit was from Darm.

Honestly, I couldn't figure out how to interpret Alma's change in expression. Was it a feeling of remorse for her fellow countrymen being involved in such a major incident? Or perhaps a fear that a spy might have been exposed?

"So, Bietti is from Darm, and I want to ask various questions."

Og's eyes were extremely serious when he said that.

Originally, Alma was already somewhat subdued due to her position as the Crown Prince's wife, and this atmosphere made her even more so.

"Various questions?"

"Indeed."

Maria looked at Alma while saying that.

Come to think of it, I had warned everyone back in Quanlong to be cautious of individuals sent from Darm. She must have remembered that.

However, Maria's expression as she looked at Alma was complex.

After all, they had been working together for several months. There had been nothing suspicious about their work, and Maria probably didn't want to view her with suspicion.

The other Katarina had an utterly clueless expression, muttering, "Huh? Huh?"

"Your Highness, so, leaving Alma aside, why were Katarina and I called here?"

In response to Maria's question, Og took out the familiar thing.

"Oh, this...?"

"That's right. When you wear this, you can only speak the truth... It's basically a magical tool for extracting confessions."

Maria, who was aware of its existence, looked at Og in surprise, wondering if he was going to use it. Alma and Katarina, on the other hand, were amazed to see such a magical tool.

"Normally, it's used to prevent false testimonies during criminal investigations. Bietti hasn't committed any crimes this time. So, I'd like to confirm her willingness to wear this magical tool before she testifies. By the way, this magical tool was made by Shin and has a high level of credibility. Testimony given while wearing it is unquestionably considered the truth. What do you say?"

When Og asked her this, Alma looked at Maria, unsure of what to do.

Seeing that, Maria had a look of understanding.

"I see. So, you didn't force Bietti to wear this magical tool, and that's why you had me and Katarina here as witnesses?"

"That's right. Furthermore, when you wear this magical tool, you can't tell lies. It'll even force you to answer private questions truthfully. Bietti is a woman, and by having witnesses like you present, we can ensure that no inappropriate questions are asked and confirm that no such questions were asked."

Alma is quite earnest in this aspect, even though there's a lot of suspicion surrounding her.

With Og's level of power, he could easily force someone to wear the truth-extraction magical tool or expose their private life.

However, precisely because he can do these things, he does his best not to wield that power.

This aspect may also be one of the factors contributing to the support from the public.

Maria seemed to feel the same way, and after taking a deep breath, she turned to Alma.

"Don't worry, Alma. I've seen this magical tool being used a few times, and I've never seen any physical abnormalities. Besides, His Highness himself has instructed us not to ask inappropriate questions to women. I don't think you'll face any weird questions."

So, when Maria assured her it was fine to wear it, I chimed in as well.

"As Og mentioned earlier, testifying while wearing this magical tool is unquestionably considered the truth. Alma, have you ever come across a story in the books you've read where someone's testimony wasn't believed, and they ended up in a difficult situation? You can consider this as a way to prevent that."

Upon hearing this, Alma appeared startled.

Seems like there were books like that after all.

I thought this approach would work better with Alma.

In the end, Alma seemed to have made up her mind and turned her gaze toward Og.

"I'll... wear it."

"I see. Then, you just need to hang this around your neck."

As Og said this, he handed the pendant to Alma.

"Eh? Um, I don't need to activate it?"

"No. It's a constantly active magical tool that uses a magic stone. So, just wearing it is enough."

As Og explained, Alma slightly trembled as she put on the pendant.

Then, she took a deep breath and looked at Og.

"Um, I'm okay now."

With those words, Og's interrogation began.

"Let me get straight to the point. Bietti, were you involved in the attack on Ellie?"

"Eh? N-no."

Alma answered, albeit nervously, that she wasn't involved in the attack.

Well, with that, the questioning might already be over.

That's what I thought, but Og's questions continued.

"Next question. Do you recognize the name of this merchant?"

As Og said this, he showed Alma a piece of paper with the merchant's name on it.

She probably didn't want to say it out loud because Katarina was present.

Alma looked at the paper, tilted her head, and answered, "I don't know. I've never heard of this person," thereby proving her lack of connection with the intermediary.

... At the same time, it was also proven that there was no useful information about the intermediary.

"Next question. Bietti, did you receive any instructions from your superiors regarding this dispatch?"

Og's question was essentially a confirmation of whether Bietti had been instructed to investigate the situation among the Ultimate Magicians or within the Kingdom of Aresheid.

While this might be an uncomfortable question for some, given Og's earlier statements casting doubts, Alma did not show any displeasure. Instead, she displayed a gesture of recalling the events before coming here.

"Well, let me think... Yes."

After searching her memory for a while, Alma finally began to speak, saying, "Yes, I was told by my superiors not to worry, as my writing skills are reliable. They encouraged me to go confidently."

Upon hearing Alma's response, Og had a surprised expression.

"Huh? No... is that all?"

"Yes, that's it. Oh, and some of my colleagues envied me. They said they wished they could go, too."

It was just a regular message of encouragement from a typical boss, and the reactions from Alma's colleagues were equally standard.

Since Alma was undoubtedly wearing the truth-extraction magical tool, she was speaking the truth.

Perhaps Og hadn't expected such an unequivocal response.

Og was left somewhat dumbfounded for a while.

"Hey, Og."

"Huh!? Oh, right. Sorry, Bietti. I see, there's no issue..."

With a somewhat relieved yet disappointed expression, Og regained his composure and continued with his questions for Alma.

"Then... this will be the last question."

"Yes."

In response to Og's words, Alma adjusted her posture.

"Do you remember the day when Arenas brought a book recently?"

"Eh... Oh, yes."

"Ah, was that the day he brought Amalie's new release?"

"Yes."

When Og affirmed Katarina's statement, Alma seemed startled.

"On that day, you declined Messina's invitation and left early, right?"

"...Yes."

Huh?

What's going on here?

Honestly, I had thought that Alma's suspicions had been dispelled by the previous questions and answers, but suddenly she became very restless.

Huh? No way.

The man she had actually met...?

"That day, there is eyewitness testimony that a man was waiting for you in front of Bietti's house. After returning home, you also invited that man into your room."

As Og said this, Maria interjected, "W-Wait a minute, Your Highness! That's a private question, isn't it!?"

"Don't worry. I won't go that far. But I need to ask this."

Og said this and looked directly into Alma's eyes.

Alma... Oh, she's looking extremely terrified, more than before.

"That man... who is he?"

Even Maria, who had probably never heard this kind of low voice from Og before, flinched. Perhaps even Katarina, who was likely hearing these words for the first time, had a frightened expression. Alma, who was directly confronted with this question, seemed to be on the verge of fainting; her face was incredibly pale.

Ah... This is...

Something unusual...

As I thought that, Og urged Alma for an answer.

"What's wrong? Answer quickly."

Slightly tinged with intimidation, his words prompted Alma to finally open her mouth.

"Th-that person is..."

"That person is?"

"Um..."

"Um?"

"An... editor..."

"What?"

What does she mean by "an editor"?

Oh!

Could it be a... pervert!?

I had this thought just then.

"An... editor, editor..."

"What...?"

Alma's answer brought the meeting room to a standstill.

Not only me but also Katarina and Maria were frozen in shock.

Og... he...

"Hmm? Did I mishear it? I heard 'editor,' but..."

As he asked this, Alma's face turned bright red, not just her face but all the way to her neck, as she hung her head.

"Yes... I did say that..."

After saying this, Alma apparently didn't want to discuss it any further, as she covered her face with both hands, hiding it.

Huh? An editor?

Why would such a person come to visit Bietti?

"Wait a minute! Why would someone like that visit Bietti!?"

Ah, Og was thinking the same thing as me.

In fact, it seemed that Katarina and Maria were equally intrigued as they watched Alma's response.

Alma had kept her face hidden with her hands for a while, but since none of us said anything, she seemed to give up. She lowered her hands and started speaking while still looking down.

"Well... I write novels..."

Alma's face was as red as a tomato, or even more so.

Og, upon hearing Alma's response, seemed to be completely stunned.

He's in a daze.

"Well, so, on that day, was that person coming for a meeting then?"

Since Og seemed unhelpful, I asked the question in his place.

In response, Alma slowly shook her head.

Actually... that day was my deadline, but I hadn't finished my manuscript yet, so I was being supervised until it was completed...

"Oh, I see..."

So that's why she didn't come out for a few hours.

Alma's answer was consistent, and, above all, since she was wearing the truth-telling magical device, it was undoubtedly the truth.

I glanced at Og, and he was burying his head on the table.

Well, if you've been suspecting all sorts of things and then it turns out they were all unfounded, you'd react that way, I guess.

This is even more embarrassing for Alma than before.

Anyway, Alma, the office worker for the Ultimate Magicians, had completely dispelled her suspicions.

Thinking that, Katarina and Maria were talking to Alma.

"I see, so you're a novelist. That's why you're good at writing reports."

"Is it because you also have beautiful handwriting?"

"Huh? I wonder. I try to make it easy for the editors to read, but I've heard that some people have such messy handwriting that it's hard to decipher."

"So, Alma's the one with beautiful handwriting, then?"

"Well, I guess so."

"Thank you."

Complimented by Katarina, Alma seemed pleased and fidgety.

Perhaps she felt relieved since she had escaped Og's pressure. However, I felt bad about suspecting a teammate like Alma.

I thought that I should apologize to Alma in some way later.

While thinking that, Katarina and Maria noticed something.

"Come to think of it, I read quite a few books, but I've never heard of a writer named Alma Vi-etti."

"Yeah, I thought the same."

"Oh!"

Huh? She had just seemed to relax, but now she's acting strangely again. Maybe she's not very successful as a novelist and is embarrassed about it?

"Well... I haven't published books under my real name because it's embarrassing."

"Really? So, is Alma Vi-etti your pen name?"

"What, what? What's the pen name?"

The two of them were pressing for answers, but...

Hey, both of you, have you forgotten that Alma is still wearing the truth-telling magical device?

I was about to mention it, but I was a step too slow.

"Hey, you two..."

"Um... I go by the name 'Amalie'..."

"Eh? No way!"

Upon hearing Alma's revealed pen name, Maria, Katarina, and I stood up and shouted in astonishment.

Og, who had been burying his face in the table, also lifted his head.

What? What?

Amalie, as in that Amalie!?

The one Katarina loves and Ellie is an avid reader of, that Amalie!?

Amidst Alma's shockingly unexpected confession, all of us were left speechless.

Alma, whether because of the heavy atmosphere or her own discomfort, looked down.

In the midst of that, one person took action.

"Amalie-sensei!!"

"Eek! Eek!!"

Katarina approached Alma with a formidable look on her face.

"Could you please sign my copy of the books you've written, Sensei?"

"Wha?! Sure..."

"Thank you very much!!"

Katarina bowed her head vigorously.

Her head wasn't just at a ninety-degree angle; it was more like a standing forward bend.

Alma watched in disbelief for a moment, then suddenly came to her senses and looked flustered.

"Oh, um, Katarina-san!"

"Yes, Sensei?"

"Umm..."

Seeing Katarina's brilliant smile, Alma appeared incredibly uneasy.

Alma hesitated for a while but then finally gathered her courage to speak to Katarina.

"Um, please, Sensei, stop it... I'm embarrassed... and, if you could continue treating me the way you always have... I'd appreciate it. When people show too much respect, it creates distance, even though we're colleagues... I find it hard to connect," Alma explained.

Oh, so this was the reason Alma seemed reluctant to speak up.

From what Katarina mentioned, it seems that Amalie is a very popular author. She's likely seen people's attitudes change once they find out who she is. Alma was initially timid, but I've seen her gradually get more comfortable and chatty with everyone in the office. Maybe Alma was looking to establish these kinds of non-intimidating relationships, which is why she kept her identity secret.

When Alma requested that people continue to treat her as they always have, Katarina, who was initially perplexed, looked at Alma's pleading expression and took a deep breath.

"Understood, Alma-san. I'm sorry for going a bit overboard."

"Oh, no, it's okay! I'm the one who spoke too firmly..."

"Actually, you're quite remarkable, so there's no issue with that. But you're saying you don't want any distance between us."

"Yes! I'd be happy if you could treat me as you always have."

When Alma spoke this way, Katarina beamed with a smile.

"Hehe. Alright, then. I'll interact with you as a friend!"

Huh? Wait a minute. Not as colleagues? When did they become friends?

I tilted my head in confusion at Katarina's words, and Alma looked incredibly moved.

"Friends... Yes! We are friends!"

Alma declared this and held hands with Katarina, giggling together.

"Hey, can I have a word?"

While they were having fun, Maria was giving Alma a dirty look for some reason.

"Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to cause trouble..."

"Oh, no, it's not that."

Interrupting Alma's apology, Maria pointed at Alma.

"What's up with that? How long are you going to keep wearing that?"

"Oh, uh... Your Highness..."

"...Huh?! What?"

Og, that guy, is still in shock at a time like this.

"Um, should I still wear this?"

"Oh, I see. You can take it off now," Og said.

"Thank you."

With Og's permission, Alma removed the pendant and placed it in front of him.

"Og, does this mean Alma's suspicions have been cleared?"

"...Yeah, no issues at all. I'm sorry, Bietti. I made you uncomfortable."

Saying that, Og deeply bowed to Alma.

"Huh?! Please, Your Highness, there's no need to bow! I wasn't bothered at all!"

"I see."

"Yes!"

It seemed that Alma was more shocked by the fact that a royal was bowing to her than by the suspicions. She didn't seem concerned at all.

Seeing Alma's expression, even without the truth-telling magic tool, Og seemed relieved. After all, Alma would continue to work as an Ultimate Magicians' office staff, and it was good that there were no lingering hard feelings toward Og.

However, Og seemed to have something on his mind but hesitated to speak up.

"What's wrong, Og? Is there something else?"

When I asked, Og had a somewhat embarrassed look on his face and turned away.

"B-Bietti."

"Yes?"

"It's... quite cheeky of me to ask, but... I was wondering if you could get a autograph for Ellie later?"

"What?"

What could it be? It was unusual to see Og so hesitant.

Thinking that way, Og, his face slightly red, finally spoke up.

"E-Ellie is a huge fan of Amalie, so... if it's not too much trouble... could you get an autograph for her later?"

"Oh, sure! I'd be delighted!"

It was quite the unexpected request from Og. Alma seemed momentarily stunned but quickly agreed.

Huh, so he's asking for an autograph from a famous author for his wife. I knew it, but seeing Og's deep affection for Ellie, I couldn't help but grin.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing, really. Oh, Alma-san, I'd appreciate an autograph from you later too."

Og was giving me a bit of a glare, but I decided to let it slide. After all, we have a famous person right here, and I wouldn't want to miss out on autographs.

However, little did I know...

"Hie?! I mean, it's absurd for someone like me to give my autograph to a master like you!! If anything, I should be asking for your autograph!"

"Why would I do that?"

"Oh! I'm your friend, but can I get your autograph too?"

"Of course!"

"So, why not give me your autograph then!?"

Why do I have to give my autograph when I'm getting autographs from Og and Catalina?

Moreover, I've never even signed anything before!

The atmosphere seemed to have relaxed after Alma's suspicions were cleared. We were making a ruckus, and Maria, who wasn't a fan of Amalie and didn't want my autograph either, muttered coldly.

"What are you guys doing?"

Seeing her icy gaze, we fell silent, embarrassed by our antics.

In the end, Og and Catalina had their latest books signed and exchanged them. I gave Alma my signature on a shikishi.

Why did I have to do that?

Alma, Maria, and Catalina, who had been called in as witnesses, left the conference room, leaving only Og and me.

As soon as we were alone, Og let out a deep sigh.

"Haa... I never expected things to turn out like this."

"Well, yeah... you were really pressuring Alma like she was the culprit."

And the reasoning was way off the mark.

So it's embarrassing.

I told him that, and Og gritted his teeth.

"W-That's not what I meant to convey!"

Oh, he's just trying to hide his embarrassment.

I thought that and grinned. Then, Og clicked his tongue.

"Tch! Seriously!"

The crown prince has such bad manners?

"I had expected something from Bietti's testimony. I thought it might lead to a breakthrough. But it had nothing to do with it... In other words, the thread that could lead to the culprit has been cut."

"I see. So, is there no more information available?"

I asked, and Og ruffled his hair.

"They were quite thorough in their preparations. I can't trace any traces."

"Well, have you considered directly contacting Dam?"

At my suggestion, Og made a bitter expression again.

"There's no evidence. We only speculated that the intermediary might be from Dam, based on the unnatural way they didn't mention Dam's name. It's too uncertain to approach Dam with this. It could become an international issue."

"So troublesome..."

"Diplomacy is a hassle."

But then, it's a dead end...

"So, what do we do now?"

If it's impossible to continue pursuing the intermediary merchant without evidence, what's the plan from here? Just leave it?

"Even without evidence, it's undeniable that Dam is suspicious. From now on, we'll have to tighten border entry inspections."

"But if we only scrutinize Dam, won't it be seen as doubting our own country?"

Well, we are actually doubting it.

"We can't just focus on Dam alone. From now on, entry inspections for all countries should be stricter."

"All of them?"

Isn't that a bit too much?

I thought that, but Og shook his head.

"In this case, the lack of evidence was fortunate. An international merchant plotted to attack Ellie. Since we couldn't determine their origin, we decided to review the entry inspections for all countries. Surprisingly, no one opposed it."

"Oh, you're turning it to your advantage?"

This guy knows how to handle situations like this.

You can't stay down even if you fall.

"We failed by letting the real mastermind escape this time. If they had retreated without leaving any evidence, we would have used that to our advantage."

When Og said that, it wasn't his usual confident and inappropriate grin. He had a frowning, bitter expression.

And so, in this way, the case of the assassination attempt on Ellie was resolved. The perpetrators and mastermind were apprehended. The intermediary, who had connections with both, was revealed to be a foreign merchant but had escaped and gone missing. The instigators, the Count and his son, were sentenced to the death penalty after a trial. As for the magic brigade member who had carried out the attack, it was revealed that they had been blackmailed by holding their family hostage. They showed deep remorse and cooperated in capturing the mastermind, so they received a long sentence of forced labor instead of the death penalty. Furthermore, because the intermediary was a foreigner, entry inspections into Earlshide from all countries became much stricter due to the circumstances. Given the situation, all countries accepted this measure without complaint, with many expressing sympathy.

As a result, Dam had to comply with this, and although there was no clear evidence, Dam's interference by suspicious individuals was prevented from that point on.

...Or so it seemed.

Before the Earlshide Kingdom publicly announced the arrest of Princess Elizabeth's assassin and the tightening of border entry inspections in various countries, in one of the cities in Dam, a well-dressed man was angrily venting his frustration to his subordinate.

"That incompetent fool! He failed!"

"Ah, s-sir! P-please calm down!"

"Don't call me 'sir'!"

"Sorry, Congressman!"

"Darn it! I entrusted him with this, and he still managed to screw up!"

The congressman scolded his subordinate, then sank into a chair, burying his head in his hands.

"...Could he have left any traces?"

"W-well, he can't be that incompetent."

"I want to believe that. If even a trace remains, who knows what might happen to both of us?"

Hearing this, the subordinate shivered in fear.

After all, their opponent was the powerful Earlshide Kingdom. While publicly claiming that the Ultimate Magicians were not part of their national assets, their Crown Prince was the second in command. If that country... If the Crown Prince decided to take things seriously, the congressman and his subordinate would disappear in no time.

That's why they had devised such a roundabout scheme, and they had never imagined they would fail.

From that day on, the congressman spent many sleepless nights, unable to rest. However, when he saw the contents publicly announced by Earlshide, he felt deep relief.

It's okay; they haven't reached this far.

That was the guarantee of his safety.

From that day on, the congressman could sleep soundly again. But a few days later, as a result of the stricter border entry inspections, several of his subordinates were arrested, and he had no idea that he would soon face sleepless nights filled with regret.
