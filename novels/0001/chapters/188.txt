for a team-building day with remote employees

"Hao, what on earth is going on?"

Hao was surrounded by several officials in a chamber of the Yu Emperor's palace.

Hao was seated in a chair at the center of the room, while the surrounding officials sat on a slightly raised platform. Their demeanor made it seem as if they were regarding Hao as a criminal, and Hao himself felt the humiliation and trembled.

"Indeed, according to the documents you provided, Lord Hao, the dragons were said to be on the brink of extinction."

"However, it appears that the so-called endangered species, the dragons, have suddenly experienced a massive increase."

"Let me ask you again, Lord Hao. What exactly is going on here?"

The officials asked these questions one after another, and Hao glared at them with resentment.

Hao held a particularly high position among the officials of Kuanglong, and the officials surrounding him now were of lower status than him. However, they were all taking this opportunity to collectively look down on him. It was nothing but humiliation.

"Are you going to remain silent, Lord Hao?"

"If you stay silent, it means you admit that the report you submitted about the dragons was false, doesn't it?"

"N-No! I didn't know! I only submitted the bill in response to a request from the research organization!"

Hao immediately retorted to one of the officials' words, of course, a lie. One of the officials grinned upon hearing Hao's words.

"Oh, so you're saying, Lord Hao, that you submitted the bill without properly examining the report?"

"Well... I mean..."

"Is it different? You clearly just said that, didn't you?"

Feeling intense anger towards the officials who were smirking and looking down on him, Hao clenched his teeth to the point of almost breaking them.

Why did someone as high-ranking as himself have to be disrespected by such lower-ranked individuals? For the proud Hao, such treatment was nothing but humiliation.

He thought that the reason for this situation was all because of his assistant, who had been absent for the past few days. So Hao decided to shift all the blame onto his assistant.

"Well, the assistant claimed to have conducted the investigation, so I merely followed their word! I was deceived!"

"But you were the one who appointed that assistant, weren't you? So, doesn't the responsibility for the appointment lie with you?"

"That...!"

Facing these officials who seemed to say one thing and then another, Hao was truly frustrated.

He was completely innocent.

In fact, when he submitted the bill, Hao foresaw that the number of dragons would increase. That's why he had strengthened the surveillance of dragons to prevent any potential large-scale outbreak.

He had also arranged for his assistant to be immediately informed if any signs of a dragon population surge were detected. He even had means to hunt the increased number of dragons.

But then, his assistant disappeared.

Honestly, Hao felt like tearing apart the traitorous assistant with his own hands, but it wouldn't be advantageous if there was no one to hold accountable.

Desperately thinking, Hao came up with a story to shift responsibility to his assistant and make it work in his favor.

"Well, you see, when I heard about this from the organization and my assistant, I had suggested that something like this might happen. Protecting dragons means increasing their population."

"Oh?"

The officials clearly didn't believe him but urged him to continue.

"The organization and my assistant said that it wouldn't increase immediately because they were on the brink of extinction. However, I couldn't dispel my doubts. So, I independently prepared means to counter the dragons."

The first part was a lie, but the latter part was true.

Hao, who had gradually become more confident, spoke as if he were delivering a speech.

"According to my assistants, they said it would be okay for the next ten years. But they apparently miscalculated the breeding capacity of the dragons. The evidence is that my assistant hasn't been seen for the past few days! They ran away, fearing the responsibility!"

As Hao passionately spoke, the other officials listened without interrupting. Seeing their response, Hao was sure that they believed his words, so he steered the conversation in a direction that would benefit him.

"Certainly, I also bear responsibility for what my subordinates have caused. That's why I can't waste any more time here! I need to head to the scene as soon as possible to clean up the mess my subordinates created!"

With that statement, Hao glared at the officials surrounding him.

The officials, under his scrutiny, exchanged a few quiet words before turning back to Hao.

"Lord Hao, what is the means to counter the dragons?"

"Actually, we have excavated weapons from ancient ruins that are quite effective against dragons."

"I see..."

The officials had another hushed discussion and then informed Hao.

"Very well. Our top priority is to quickly stabilize the situation. If you have the means, Lord Hao, please use it. Can you head to the site immediately?"

Upon hearing these words, Hao breathed a sigh of relief, feeling that he had successfully navigated this crisis.

"Yes, leave it to me!"

With determination, he said that and left the room.

After Hao had left, one of the officials muttered quietly.

"Hao says that, but what's the real story?"

The answer to that mutter didn't come from the officials sitting side by side but from behind.

"It's all nonsense."

Saying that, Hao's missing assistant appeared.

The assistant, who had disappeared because they could no longer tolerate Hao's bullying, had sought protection from another official. The official providing protection saw the assistant as a means to bring down Hao.

And now, the assistant was revealing the truth.

"That report was forced by Hao from the research organization with the employees' families held hostage."

"What a despicable act."

"We can't exactly claim to be saints ourselves, but compared to that, we might as well be."

"Will we get testimony from those employees?"

"Don't worry. As soon as the report came in, I arranged for the protection of the research organization's staff and their families. Though, I doubt Hao will have time to deal with that."

"I see. By the way, is the story about having a weapon capable of countering dragons also a lie?"

"No, that part is true. When it was excavated, I was there, and I've confirmed its power."

"Is it really that powerful?"

"Yes. We didn't know its purpose, so when we conducted a test run, the shock emitted from the weapon blew away several researchers."

At those words from the assistant, the officials audibly swallowed hard.

And then, the assistant grinned again.

"Well, a dragon rampage is a major concern for our country, after all. Let's have Lord Hao do his best to subdue them."

"But, well, not reporting the discovery of such a weapon to the country is a problem, isn't it?"

Upon hearing these words, all the officials were smirking.

Seeing this sight, the assistant, witnessing the scheming behavior of these conniving officials, sighed inwardly.a database schema
