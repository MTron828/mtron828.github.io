 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

At the time when Shin and the others were leading busy yet peaceful days in Earl's Hyde,

There was a man in a tavern in a certain country, winding up a pipe.

"Damn... why do I have to go through this... I'm a capable person..."

The man, thoroughly drunk and overflowing with complaints, was the same man who had thrown a tantrum when he failed the Ultimate Magicians' exam before.

Most of the people around him had also failed, and there were only two successful applicants this time.

I've heard that there were around a thousand applicants from seven countries: Earl's Hyde, Swede, Darm, Kannan, Kurt, Ees, and Els.

Out of those applicants, only two were successful.

The pass rate is a mere 0.2%.

When the examinees heard the results, most of them thought it was only natural to fail, but there were some, like this man, who had confidence in themselves and couldn't accept their failure.

Moreover, while I failed the first exam, there were colleagues who made it to the final selection.

They didn't pass the final selection, but they were praised at the workplace for making it past the first exam.

Some even claimed to be the next ace candidates.

I couldn't forgive it.

I was supposed to be the next ace all this time.

And now, I had my position stolen by a colleague who had never stood out before.

I got so frustrated that I took it out on that person, but not only did they dodge my attacks, but the boss also witnessed the scene.

Furthermore, it was revealed that the reason for my jealousy was my resentment over passing the first exam of the Ultimate Magicians, which I had failed.

As a result, the man received a severe punishment - dismissal from the organization he belonged to.

Fortunately, there were no injuries to the victim, so no criminal charges such as assault or attempted murder were filed because the victim did not report the incident.

However, the man who had been considered promising for the future had suddenly become unemployed.

Unable to accept this fact, he came to the tavern and got drunk like this.

The people around him knew roughly how he had ended up like this, so there was no one to comfort him.

In the midst of this, one man approached.

"Good evening."

"...Huh? Who are you?"

Hector saw the person who approached him with a blurred gaze from his drunken state.

"Would you mind sharing a table?"

"Sure, go ahead."

Hector responded, and the man poured a glass of alcohol from a bottle.

However, since he had already drunk most of it, only a little was poured into the glass.

"Damn! What a stroke of bad luck..."

Hector muttered as he quickly downed the small amount of alcohol in his glass.

"Hector Garias."

The man who sat with him said that to Hector, who was about to slam the glass on the table, and stopped his hand.

"How do you know my name?"

Hector's expression shifted from boredom to alertness in an instant.

However, the man who approached him continued to smile without changing his expression.

"Of course, I did some research."

The man said and took out a notebook from his breast pocket, starting to read its contents.

"Hector Garias, last year's top graduate of the Kurt Advanced School of Magic. You joined Kurt's Ministry of Magic and received promising evaluations, but you failed in the first stage of the Ultimate Magicians' new member entrance exam. After that, you caused trouble at the Ministry of Magic and were dismissed..."

In a voice too quiet for anyone else to hear, the man conveyed this to Hector.

Hector frowned. "Who are you?"

"Hehe, by the way, Hector, are you interested in seeking revenge?"

"Huh?"

Not only did he not answer the question, but Hector also regarded the man, who suddenly made a menacing proposal, with even more suspicion.

"Well, your situation is because you failed that exam, right?"

"..."

"And on top of that, a less skilled man than you made it to the final test."

"..."

"By the way, do you know?"

"...Huh? Know what?"

Hector had been refusing to answer for a while, but he finally reacted to the man's question.

And there, he was shocked.

"One of the successful candidates is... a young man who was the top graduate of this year's Kurt Advanced School of Magic and had just joined the Ministry of Magic."

"!!"

As soon as Hector heard those words, he knocked over his chair and stood up.

"What... Is that true?"

Hector's interest was directed toward his classmates from school whom he had competed with for the top spot during their academy days and the colleagues he should outperform after joining the Ministry of Magic.

He had no interest in younger newcomers, especially those who had just joined.

I failed, and yet, a kid younger than me, who just joined, passed?

Hector was trembling with anger.

"Don't you find it strange?"

"Huh!?"

It was an offhand question from the man, but Hector, who was seething with anger, stared at him fiercely.

"A person less skilled than you passes, and you fail. This is clearly odd, isn't it?"

"...Yeah. They must have used connections or money to rig it somehow."

Hector said and sat back in his chair with a snort.

"I think the same. So, how about this? Want to investigate?"

Hector tilted his head in response to the man's suggestion.

"Investigate? How would we do that?"

The man smiled slyly.

"We'll arrange it here. What do you think? Would you like to uncover the corruption and seek revenge against the Ultimate Magicians... and Earl's Hyde?"

Hector gazed at the man's face for a while and nodded in silence.
