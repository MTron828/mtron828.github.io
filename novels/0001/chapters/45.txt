Several days have passed since I added monster subjugation to my training.

I continued to defeat small, medium, large, and disaster-class monsters one after another, and the rewards for these subjugations kept increasing.

From those subjugation rewards, I received money from everyone as payment for battle attire.

I initially refused, but they insisted forcefully that it wouldn't be right to just accept charity, so in the end, my account balance was restored.

In fact, I also received a considerable amount from the monster subjugation rewards, so my wealth actually increased.

In my previous life, I was always living on a tight budget, so even when I get a large sum of money, I don't really know what to do with it.

When I mentioned this to Miss Irene, she gave me a sympathetic look and said, "It's a good thing for parents to marry their daughter to someone financially comfortable. I'm happy to see your assets growing, Shin. If you ever have trouble managing your wealth, feel free to come and talk to me. Despite appearances, the Marquis's family is also involved in managing estates."

"Thank you very much."

"Claude, there's also a business opportunity related to the worldwide distribution of communication devices that Shin will be getting involved in. I think it would be a good idea to start a trading company."

"That's a good point. Shin, do you know anyone from the Magician's Guild who is involved in trading companies?"

"Why do you say that, Grandma? It should be Grandpa, not you."

"Oh, Shin, you don't know? Most of the magical tools used in everyday life that are currently on the market were invented by members of the Magician's Guild."

"I've heard of that."

"And the rights to those inventions?"

"Oh... I haven't heard about that."

"Those inventions by members of the Magician's Guild are now widely distributed worldwide, you know? They can't be managed by individuals. It's likely that they are being handled through some trading company."

"Oh... so that's why it might be Uncle Tom."

"Uncle Tom?"

"Tom Harg, the representative of the Harg Trading Company. He used to visit our house frequently and said he was indebted to Grandpa in the past, but it was actually Grandma."

"You know the representative of the Harg Company!?"

Alice, who had been listening to the conversation, suddenly spoke up.

Come to think of it, Alice's father is in charge of the finances at the Harg Trading Company.

"Yeah, didn't I mention it before?"

"I haven't heard anything about it!"

"Harg Trading Company, huh? I see. Indeed, that company stands out from the rest in terms of the variety and quality of magical tools they provide. So, is that the trading company that the Magician's Guild deals with?"

Oops, did I accidentally reveal something I shouldn't have?

The members of the research club also attended today in their uniforms, and I heard that their families would be coming as well.

As we were about to change into our outfits...

There was a knock on the door to the room where everyone had gathered.

"Come in."

I replied, and the door was opened to reveal three men and women.

"Big brother! Big sister!"

"Oh, Sisily! Long time..."

"Aww, Sisily, it's been so long!"

"You've become even cuter!"

"Ugh... big sister... it's hard..."

"It's been a while since I met my cute little sister! Can't you endure it for a little while?"

"Yes! It's my cute little sister's engagement party, after all... When I heard about it from Father, I felt really sad, big sister!"

Oh, wow... Sisily's sisters are doting on her so much! Is this the kind of situation where they're saying something like, "You're not worthy of our cute little sister!"?

"Are you Shin-kun?"

"Yes!"

"Hmm..."

Oh no... They're looking at me... They're really looking at me!

"I was thinking of finding something to criticize about any man who touched my super cute sister..."

"Being the grandchild of the Sage and the Magician, handsome, wealthy, and a more powerful wizard than the Sage... Where can we find fault with you..."

"Uh, thank you..."

Oh? It seems like I avoided something!

"Ho ho, so how did our grandchild do? Did you win their approval?"

"Of course. He's my grandson."

"Eh?"

"Could it be, the Sage and the Magician?"

"It's Shin's grandfather, Merlin."

"His grandmother, Merida."

Once grandpa and grandma introduced themselves, the two sisters straightened up.

"G-Greetings, sorry for the delayed introduction! I'm Cecilia von Claude, the eldest daughter of the Claude Viscount Family and Sisily's sister!"

"Likewise, I'm Sylvia von Claude, the second daughter of the Claude Viscount Family and Sisily's sister! It's an honor to meet you!"

Their eyes, which had been appraising me just a moment ago, now held admiration and respect as they looked at grandpa and grandma.

"Ho ho, don't be too formal, you're the sisters of my grandson's fianc√©e, so no need to be so stiff."

"That's right, we're going to be family, so there's no need to be formal."

"Th-the family of the Sage and the Magician..."

"Ah, is this not a dream?"

"Sisily!"

"What is it, Cecilia, big sister?"

"Seriously, Shin's surroundings are always so noisy."

"Huh? Your Highness August!?"

"Why are you here?"

"Why not? I'm also a member of the same research club as Shin and his friend. It's not strange for me to be here, is it?"

"Is that so?"

"Oh, I apologize! We didn't mean to ignore Your Highness..."

"Oh, don't worry about it. Like I said before, I'm here today as a friend of these two."

"She's the one who introduced them to each other, after all."

Sisily's words surprised her sisters, and they expressed their gratitude to August.

"We were unaware of the significant efforts you've put in, and we were terribly rude."

"And we'd like to thank you for facilitating this. As an older sister, I appreciate it. Thank you."

Caught up in the moment, Lois also kneeled down.

"So, Your Highness! I apologize for the delayed greeting. And I appreciate what you've done. Thank you."

It seemed like grandpa and August had hit it off quite well.

The "Air Alliance"... What a peculiar alliance...

As we hadn't changed into our outfits yet, everyone left the room, saying they would help with the preparations at the venue.

"It was nerve-wracking..."

"Even though they're your real siblings?"

"My big sisters said they would assess my future partner when the time comes... I thought I'd be fine with Shin-kun, but when it actually happened..."

"Well, you never know what they might say."

"It's all thanks to Grandpa and Grandma. They accepted it quite easily."

Addressing them as "Grandpa" and "Grandma," the two of them had a satisfied look.

Sisily also left to change, and I finished changing into my outfit.

Finally, it was time, and Sisily, who had finished changing, returned to the room.

Her blue dress had a more mature appearance than when we had a family-only party, with fewer frills. She kept the same hairstyle, tied up, and her accessories were more luxurious than the previous time.

She had applied subtle makeup, making her look even more grown-up.

"Well then, shall we go?"

"Yes."

Sisily and I walked arm in arm towards the hall.

Grandpa and grandma followed behind us.

We could have waited in the hall, but it might cause a commotion, so we decided to enter together.

As we got closer to the hall, I could feel a large number of people. How many people are here?

It seems quite bustling.

Oh, I wonder if Uncle Dis is here. Maybe he's already in the hall?

"Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the long wait. It's time to introduce our two main guests. Please welcome them with warm applause."

Cecil's voice was heard through a magical amplification device, and the doors of the hall were opened.

It kind of feels like a senior's wedding ceremony I attended in my past life.

As the doors opened, we were greeted with a huge round of applause.

There seemed to be some sort of aisle, and at the end of it were Cecil, Irene, and Uncle Dis.

They were there, just as I expected. No wonder there was a commotion.

Grandpa, pay more attention to us than them!

It's challenging to resist the urge to make comments even though it's our celebration!

Grandpa and grandma joined the group of guardians, and the ceremony began with Uncle Dis's words.

"This engagement between Shin Wolford and Sisily von Claude is hereby approved with the presence of Disum von Alsheid as the witness. Is there any objection from either side?"

Grandpa and grandma nodded in silence in response to Uncle Dis's words.

"Then, we recognize both of them as engaged, and hereby approve it."

The words were met with applause from the audience.

"Let's keep the formalities to a minimum. Now, everyone, please raise your glasses. To celebrate the promising future of these two... Cheers!"

"Cheers!"

Finally, the engagement party had begun, and it was quite an ordeal.

Relatives who had known Sisily for a long time came to congratulate her, but since I hadn't met most of the people before, I felt mentally drained.

"Congratulations, you two. I guess you've been dating all along."

"Well, anyone who saw how you two were together wouldn't think otherwise. Congratulations, Shin, Sisily."

"Zeke, Chris..."

"What's wrong? You look kind of down."

"It's because they are all new people, so I'm nervous..."

"So even Shin gets nervous sometimes."

"I wonder what Chris thinks of me!?"

"I'm sorry, Shin, I had my doubts too."

"You guys are ruthless!"

It wasn't until Zeke and Chris, who couldn't make it last time, came to the party that I finally caught my breath. I was really on edge the whole time.

There were a few people who gave me a death stare...

And the next day was August's birthday and the Crown Prince Ceremony.

The ceremony was held on a stage built in front of the royal palace and was open to the public.

During the ceremony, Cecil used a magical communication device, which was essentially a microphone and a speaker. The microphone had the ability to transmit sound, while the speaker had the abilities to receive sound and amplify it.

Cecil had used it for a trial run earlier.

Then came the actual day of the ceremony.

"Oh... August looks quite princely."

"Well, not 'quite,' he is a prince."

Observing August dressed in ceremonial attire for the ceremony, I unintentionally made that comment.

"What is it, I wonder? I'm starting to feel embarrassed wearing this in front of everyone."

"Your Highness August, it seems like you've been influenced a bit too much by Shin and his friends... Is that how it is?"

"Hey! We just had the engagement party yesterday, didn't we?"

"Well... Never mind. Your Highness August, there will be more such occasions in the future, so please try to regain your original sensibilities."

"Right, I understand."

Today, we were not in our school uniforms but were wearing the combat outfits I gave them. We were going to go up on stage together and watch the ceremony.

The stage in front of the royal palace was packed with people, and the ceremony to appoint August as the Crown Prince was about to begin.

"My son, August von Alsheid. Do you pledge to dedicate your life to this country and its people as the Crown Prince?"

"I swear to dedicate my life to this country and its people."

"Very well, you have spoken well. August, I recognize you as the Crown Prince. We hope you will strive for the people."

"I am humbled."

The words of the two, conveyed through the microphone, resonated throughout the square.

Cheers erupted from the gathered citizens in front of the stage.

As the Crown Prince ceremony was coming to a close, a soldier rushed onto the stage.

Out of breath and clearly having run with all his might, the soldier broke through the attempts of others to stop him and shouted, "I have a report! We've received a communication from the Kingdom of Sweed!"

The Kingdom of Sweed was a neighboring small country that shared borders with the Empire and the Kingdom.

The soldier had sprinted in with a frantic appearance after receiving the communication from there.

That means...

"The Kingdom of Sweed is experiencing a large-scale appearance of demons! They have entered a state of conflict!"

As expected, it was a report that the demons had finally begun to take action.

"Fool! What madness is this, reporting such news in the middle of the ceremony!"

"Enough! Do not blame that individual."

The one who spoke was not Uncle Dis, but August.

"Your Highness..."

"You did well to inform me. The news of demon appearances takes precedence over anything else. Delaying such a report would have been the problem."

Oh, August sounded very princely.

August's words were being heard by everyone through the microphone.

The citizens gathered in the square began to murmur as they heard about the appearance of the demons.

"Everyone, please calm down and listen. Just now, we received a report that demons have appeared in the neighboring kingdom, Sweed."

August began to explain to the citizens gathered in the square.

"But don't be worried. We already have the means to counter the demons."

Saying that, August looked at my face.

In that instant, I understood. This was a performance.

It was a measure to give hope to the anxious citizens, now that the demons had finally started to take action.

"Shin!"

August called me out in a loud voice, and I responded by standing next to him.

"He is Shin Walford, my friend and the grandson of the hero Merlin Walford. He is the new hero who defeated the demons that appeared recently."

The citizens were watching August's explanation with bated breath.

"I... We have continued to train with Shin, and we have finally gained the power to counter the demons."

August motioned for the other members of the research club to join him.

"We can now defeat disaster-class demons single-handedly!"

"Defeat disaster-class demons by ourselves!?"

It seemed that the surprise among the soldiers was greater than that of the citizens upon hearing those words.

"That's right! According to reports, the artificial demons are almost as strong as disaster-class demons. Do you think we'll lag behind those creatures!?"

I had reported that they were slightly stronger than disaster-class demons, but close enough to be considered "almost." So, it wasn't a lie.

"We will immediately head to the Kingdom of Sweed and defeat the demons. Rest assured!"

Saying that, August removed his ceremonial attire. Underneath, he was already wearing the research club's combat outfit.
