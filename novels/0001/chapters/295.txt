A few days after Silver brought his friends, there were some people who came to visit the Wolford residence.

"Oh, really? So Silver's got friends, huh? Has he reached the age to be interested in love affairs already?" Alice said in a nostalgic tone.

"Yeah, I thought he was a baby not too long ago," Yuri said in a similar tone. Both Alice and Yuri had recently given birth and were currently on maternity leave.

Alice, who was smaller in stature than the average adult woman, had a risky delivery, but with Cecily's full support during the stable period, she safely gave birth. Alice gave birth to a cute little boy with blonde hair inherited from his parents and a face that resembled Alice. He was named Squall.

People who saw him for the first time usually mistook him for a girl because he was so cute.

Yuri, on the other hand, gave birth to a girl who had a face resembling her husband Morgan, a craftsman at the Bean Workshop. The baby girl was named Annette. She didn't resemble the gentle Yuri much and had a determined expression on her face, even though she was just a newborn.

Both of them were struggling with their first-time parenting, so they often sought refuge with Cecily, who had already raised two children and was now raising her third.

"Children grow up in the blink of an eye. Ours are getting more and more mischievous every day," Olivia, who was also on maternity leave and expecting soon, sighed while looking in a certain direction from the living room.

In that direction, Alice's child Squall, Yuri's child Annette, and Cecily's child Sean were all lying in the same crib. A few slightly older toddlers surrounded the crib, peering inside.

"Babies are so cute, aren't they?"

"Yeah," Max, Olivia's son, and Rain, Chris's son, said as they looked at the peacefully sleeping babies.

The person saying that was also a cute toddler, just three years old in the eyes of adults. The mothers had to stifle their laughter as they watched the toddlers call the babies cute.

"Sean, you're like a big sister, aren't you?"

"That's right, I'm a big sister!"

Next to the adorable boys, Octavia and Charlotte, two girls, were having a less charming conversation.

"There was a girl here who seemed more mature than Silver's friends."

Elizabeth, Octavia's mother, made an uncharacteristic comment for a three-year-old girl, which drew awkward chuckles from the others.

"While it's evident that Princess Octavia has a fondness for Silver, what about Silver himself, Cecily?"

Christina, a member of the Royal Guard and a close friend of Crown Princess Elizabeth, inquired. Cecily pondered for a moment.

"Well, at the moment, I think Silver sees her more as a little sister, like Charlotte. A three-year age gap at this age is quite significant, so I believe Silver doesn't view her as a romantic interest."

"Yes, that's true. So for now, we're not putting too much emphasis on that. Perhaps as they grow older, they might naturally become aware of such feelings?"

"But in the meantime, we shouldn't let Silver get distracted by others, so we plan to encourage Viya to make her appeal."

Christina was initially just curious about Sylvester's behavior, but she unexpectedly noticed that both Cecily and Elizabeth were quite serious about bringing Sylvester and Octavia together.

"You're quite serious about this, huh?"

"Well, in the end, it's the individual's choice that matters. As Viya's mother, I genuinely want to support her first love."

"Since Silver is three years older, he might develop feelings for someone other than Viya. But I would be happy if he ends up with Viya."

The two classmates, who had become mothers before Alice and Yuri, were surprised that they were already thinking about their children's romantic prospects.

"Wow, you're thinking about that already?"

"I'm so busy taking care of them that I don't have the luxury to think about such things. By the way, Olivia, are you thinking about it?"

"Me?"

Olivia, who was suddenly asked, looked at her son, who was in the crib, and then replied, "He's only three years old."

"Ellie is thinking about her three-year-old daughter's future partner, so she's asking!"

"Well, even so... Both Ellie and Cecily are noble daughters, so maybe they think about it early. We're commoners, so we've never thought about such things."

Olivia's words finally made Yuri and Alice, who were also commoners, agree.

Commoners didn't arrange marriage partners for their children when they were young.

"I get it now. That's why Cecily and Ellie are thinking about their children's future since a young age."

Cecily smiled at Alice's words.

"Well, arranging engagement partners from a young age is an old custom. However, it was always said that the people you date are the ones you marry."

In Earlsheid, even among nobles, free love was the norm, and arranged marriages were considered old-fashioned. However, the practice of forming alliances through marriage was undoubtedly an effective means of ensuring the prosperity of one's lineage, so political marriages had not disappeared.

"But Alice, as a concerned sister, you should be careful. Many people may want to incorporate your bloodline."

"Please, stop it. But you're right. With the Claude Viscount's family in the mix, we need to be cautious."

Looking at Alice, who had started to think seriously, someone chuckled.

"It's surprising to see Alice thinking about her child's future."

Maria, who was the only one in the room without children, remarked with a smirk.

The two of them used to seriously worry whether they could have boyfriends or even get married.

Now both of them were married, and one had already given birth to a child.

While Maria felt nostalgic about the transformation from their past concerns, Alice didn't share the sentiment.

"It's not a laughing matter! Maria, you'll worry about the same thing when you have children! Your husband, Els, is the President's son, after all! It's even more challenging!"

"...That's true."

Maria had married Cartas, the son of President Els and an Ultimate Magicians clerk.

Since Els is the president in a democracy, the Zenith family will no longer be the First Family once Aaron's term as president ends.

"I thought Cartas wasn't going to run for president, so I thought we'd become powerless commoners..."

"...That's not really the case."

Elizabeth, looking at Maria, who spoke resentfully, was surprised. Once you were part of a former First Family, you didn't exactly return to being ordinary citizens, and you maintained significant influence in political matters.

In other words, their social status remained high. Therefore, even the children born to Maria, who married into the Zenith family, needed to choose their partners carefully.

"By the way, Olivia, you may seem unconcerned, but isn't Bean Workshop now one of the largest workshops in the capital, Earlsheid? Max is going to inherit it, so you should be concerned."

Maria's words made Olivia's face suddenly change.

"...I just realized that now."

"I had a feeling you might."

Just a few years ago, Olivia was the daughter of a small-town diner, and her husband Mark's family workshop, while well-regarded, was just a small-scale workshop. Olivia's family remained unchanged, but the Bean Workshop she married into had grown into a massive workshop that was considered one of the largest in the Earlsheid capital, with not only its main workshop but also a large factory on the outskirts of the capital.

Olivia was not directly involved in the management of the workshop, so she had been somewhat oblivious to these developments.

"To be honest, among us here, it seems like only Yuri's family and Lady Chris' family don't have to worry about this kind of thing, right?"

"That's right. It's quite relaxing."

"As for us..."

"Chris, my dear niece..."

Yuri felt relieved that she seemed to have fewer worries about her child's future than her friends. Just as Chris was about to respond, Max called out to her.

"What's wrong?"

"Rain fell asleep."

"..."

As everyone had been watching the sleeping baby, Christina, who seemed to have fallen asleep while holding her son, picked up Rain and took him to the nap area. After returning, she said, "Honestly, I wonder if our child's personality is suitable for a partner..."

Faced with Christina's uncertainty about her child's future partner, which seemed to stem more from the child's personality than their background, no one knew what to say.

"It's, it's alright! Rain, you have a cute face just like Lady Chris!"

"I hope so..."

Christina's son, Rain, looked remarkably like Christina. However, his personality was neither as serious as his mother's nor as carefree as his father, Siegfried. It was more like an unpredictable and carefree personality.

"Children can be so different, though."

While watching the children, Maria suddenly said, "Viya is like a smaller Ellie, right?"

"Is that so?"

"Yes, that's right. Max is straightforward and looks just like Mark, but he's also good at showing consideration, just like Olivia."

"Hehe, thank you."

"And Charlotte..."

Maria said this and then watched Charlotte, who seemed to have grown tired of looking at the babies and was now running towards the toy area. "She completely takes after Shin when it comes to not holding back, even with royalty," Maria added.

"That's true."

When her daughter was said to resemble her husband, Cecily smiled happily.

"I don't think that's something to be happy about... But I wonder who she got that innocence from? Cecily has always been so mature."

After saying that, Maria turned her gaze to Christina, the only one who knew Shin's childhood.

"What do you think? Shin's childhood isn't very informative because of certain circumstances. He was a calm child, except for overdoing it with magic."

Christina had previously discussed Shin's past life memories with Cecily and Siegfried, as she was considered part of the family.

"Oh, I see. So, does that mean that nobody knows about Shin's true childhood?"

"That's right. But, well, that's fine, isn't it? Children don't necessarily inherit their parents' personalities. Look at Merlin-sama and Shin. They have no blood relation, but they're so alike. It's all about the environment they grow up in, right?"

"Speaking of which..."

After hearing Christina's words, Cecily seemed to recall something.

"Lately, Silver's words and actions have been becoming more like Shin's."

Upon Cecily's statement, everyone fell silent.

"He's already become so proficient in activating magical tools, and he seems rather dissatisfied with not being taught magic. Getting swordsmanship training from Lady Chris and Ms. Miranda, it feels like he's practicing with older cousins. He even regards members of the royal family as friends."

Everyone was left speechless by Cecily's report.

Certainly, even though he couldn't use magic from a young age, he could wield magical tools, and he was receiving training from Christina, the former idol of the Royal Guard, and Miranda, who was considered a candidate for the next Sword Saint. What's more, he treated members of the royal family as friends.

"...Even though they're not blood-related, it's as if we're hearing about Shin's background..."

"It seems that the environment... people who raise you, influence you. So, why is Rain..."

"Well, let's put that aside. Silver seems like a second Shin, doesn't he? Eventually, he might say something like, 'Oops, did I do something?'" Alice interjected, cutting off Christina's contemplative words, which elicited laughter from everyone.

However, mother Cecily was the only one who rested her hand on her cheek with a troubled expression.

"I have a feeling he might say something like that at the academy..."

With those words, everyone fell into a subdued silence.

Observing their reactions, Alice murmured softly, "It seems like Silver's generation is going to have a hard time."

Those words slipped effortlessly into the hearts of everyone. with concepts
