"Ugh... this is bad for my heart. Why did they suddenly start killing people? Are they idiots?"

"Well, well, Navar-san, calm down."

As soon as they got on the carriage, Navar-san spat out those words.

"Just how hard do you think it was to maintain composure? I did my best to put on a show because that was the plan!"

While his tone was quite stern, Navar's words were a bit pitiful.

"However, Navar, you're really doing quite well as a diplomat. It's a far cry from the Three Nations Conference."

"I really don't want to remember that, Your Highness."

Come to think of it, during the Three Nations Conference, I remembered that Navar was quite angry about the demands he had presented.

I don't know the details of what he demanded, but it seemed that even in such a situation, his merchant spirit was strong enough to pursue profits.

"So, what's the plan from here? Will Navar lead the negotiations, or should I join in?"

"For now, I'll handle the talks on my own. In negotiations like this, it's better if we coordinate a bit more..."

"Well, we've only had a rough discussion. Understood. However, we must secure the trade of dragonhide leather at all costs."

"It's a banned commodity now. Well, I can smooth things over somehow."

"In that case, Lord Shaolin, I'll leave the translation to you."

"Understood."

After discussing the negotiations inside the carriage, they arrived at a large building.

It wasn't tall, but it was quite wide horizontally.

The architectural style was not commonly seen near Arusheid, as the buildings they had seen along the way were different.

It was somewhat similar to ancient Japan, with structures made of wood and plaster, most of them not exceeding two stories in height.

"This is the Yuukouden. It serves as Emperor His Majesty Kwanglong's residence and the heart of Kwanglong's administration."

Shaolin explained about the large building in front of them.

"This place is both the Emperor's residence and the center of Kwanglong's government. I've never been here before."

Shaolin's eyes seemed to be filled with a sense of awe as she spoke.

"I've never been here before, and that's natural."

As we looked around at the unusual architectural style of the building, Hao-san approached us.

"They have prepared rooms for you here. After a short rest, there will be an audience with the Emperor and dinner."

That's what he said.

So, we were gathered in a room inside the building.

We were told to wait until we were called.

When everyone entered the room, Aug spoke up.

"Shin, make sure to give those things to Navar and the diplomats."

Aug said this and tapped his chest.

Ah, those things.

"Navar-san, everyone, please wear these."

What I took out was a pendant with a magic stone that grants the 'foreign object exclusion' effect.

Since we might be attacked by people who act like their subordinates have gone berserk, it's better to be cautious.

"Why is that?"

Navar asked, so I explained the effect to him.

Both Navar-san and Shaolin-san were wide-eyed and surprised. They've been showing a lack of trust in Kwanglong since earlier, but Shaolin-san and Leafan-san didn't utter a word of complaint. Well, Shaolin-san probably hasn't met her older sister yet, and she probably doesn't want to ruin her mood. There's also what happened yesterday.

After everyone put on the pendants, we asked how we should conduct ourselves when meeting the Emperor later. Since Shaolin-san is a native of this country, she said that we need to show respect to the Emperor, but we are foreigners. There's no need for special respect, but we should maintain basic courtesy. For now, just bow with respect.

After receiving this lecture and checking on Silver, who was left at home today, the door was knocked, and we were told that the preparations were complete.

We followed the soldiers who had come to get us and were led to a huge door.

Is this the audience room?

When we arrived, the massive door opened immediately.

Inside, there were many people dressed in lavish clothing.

Are they the nobles of this country? I'm not even sure if they have a nobility system.

We walked through the audience room, exposed to many curious eyes. We were somewhat accustomed to this, and since we were foreigners, we weren't too nervous, but Shaolin-san and Leafan-san seemed extremely tense. Their faces were pale, and their steps were trembling. They looked like they might collapse any moment.

When we reached in front of the throne, we stopped. No one was sitting on the throne yet.

At that moment, one of the officials raised his voice, and everyone around kneeled in unison. Shaolin-san also knelt.

I realized that what had been said earlier was an introduction for the Emperor. We hastily lowered our heads.

After a short wait, someone appeared and sat on the throne.

"-----"

We heard some words, and the people around and Shaolin-san stood up. If they stood up, it probably meant something like "You may relax," and I lifted my head as well.

Then, a young man, or rather a boy, sat on the throne. He looked quite young. Perhaps even younger than us.

The boy, rather than a man, was seated on the throne.

"-----"

The boy said something, and Shaolin-san nervously replied.

"I have been entrusted with the role of interpreter, so I will be interpreting for you and His Majesty from now on."

I see, the earlier statement was probably something like "Convey your words," and Shaolin-san must have given her consent. And so, the conversation with Emperor Kwanglong began.

"You've traveled a long way. I never dreamed that envoys would come from beyond the desert."

"Today, I am truly delighted to have the honor of an audience with Your Majesty."

"I see. I am delighted as well to establish connections with a nation we have not previously interacted with."

"Thank you."

"I would like to have a detailed discussion. Consult thoroughly with your foreign affairs representative."

"Yes, thank you."

This concludes the conversation between the Emperor and Navar.

Well, Navar-san is quite different from Els' dialect, and it feels rather awkward.

After a brief greeting, the Emperor quickly withdrew. I thought he would participate in the upcoming discussions, but it seems it was just a courtesy visit. I can't help but feel a bit let down.

However, he did join us for the dinner afterward. Of course, there was no conversation with us. It felt like he was simply present at the dinner table.

By the way, the dishes served at the dinner were similar to Chinese cuisine. Naturally, we used chopsticks. I had been practicing throughout our stay since I knew there were chopsticks in the border village with the desert. I'm already proficient in using chopsticks, so I don't think I embarrassed myself in front of the Emperor.

I haven't seen rice in a while, but we did have fried rice. It was incredibly delicious, and I don't think there was any strange poison in it, but who knows? Poison or medicine wouldn't affect us now, so it's hard to say.

If it were an odorless and tasteless poison, we wouldn't notice.

After the audience with the Emperor, we were led to our assigned rooms for the night. We were divided into pairs, with Aug and me, Thor and Julius, Tony and Mark, Sissi and Maria, Alice and Lynn, Yuri and Olivia. The diplomatic delegation was also divided into pairs.

They provided us with magic items with 'invasion prevention' and 'soundproofing' effects when entering our rooms, so it's safe even if only the women are staying. Well, I don't expect the envoys who just had an audience with the Emperor to do anything, but it's better to be cautious.

Now, tomorrow is the negotiation with Hao-san. I'm not the one conducting it, but I'm starting to feel nervous. Will I be able to sleep?

While Shin and the others were resting in their assigned rooms, Hao summoned his assistant in his office.

"Hey, do you think they put that drug in their food?"

"Yes, undoubtedly. I saw it with my own eyes."

"Then why haven't we seen any changes in their behavior?"

"Well, even if you say that..."

"Are you absolutely certain?"

"Yes, I am."

"Yes, we mixed in the most potent aphrodisiac in the country. It's tasteless and odorless, so there's no chance of them noticing, and they certainly consumed it."

"Hmm... could they have some countermeasure?"

"Against that aphrodisiac...? But the aphrodisiac isn't a poison, and they didn't show any sign of activating any magic tools."

"Then why..."

"I... I will investigate."

While Hao was speaking, there was a knock on the door, and his subordinate's voice could be heard from the other side.

"What's going on?"

"Uh, well... I can't enter their rooms!"

"What!? Nonsense! You have the keys, don't you?"

"Well, the thing is... the keys won't open!"

"Could you be mistaken about the keys?"

"N-no! It's definitely their room keys! And it's the same for all the rooms, we can't open any of them!"

Hearing the report from his subordinate, Hao muttered in disbelief.

"Absurd... What on earth is happening..."

Every part of his plan had gone awry, and Hao slumped into his chair.

Hao had planned to set up a honeypot trap. He intended to mix aphrodisiacs in Shin and the others' food to induce sexual excitement. With both men and women present, he expected some of them to engage in sexual activities in an aroused state. If Hao's group had caught them in the act, they could have interrogated them about what they were doing in the sacred palace. He believed this would give them an advantage in the negotiations.

However, a report from his subordinates indicated that Shin and the others had entered separate rooms, and it seemed they were not in a state of sexual excitement. This made Hao suspect that something was amiss.

In an attempt to regain control, Hao had also prepared a selection of male and female prostitutes from the country, with a focus on the most attractive ones. He planned to send them into each room. Unfortunately, this plan had also failed as they couldn't enter the rooms.

All the preparations he had made for this day since receiving the report two weeks ago that envoys were coming from beyond the desert to establish diplomatic relations had been in vain. All of his plans had collapsed, and Hao felt utterly defeated.

Hao had gone to such lengths because he had received reports that the envoys had arrived in flying vehicles from beyond the desert, and he desperately wanted those vehicles.

With those flying vehicles, they would have been able to invade the country beyond the desert and the island nation even further east of Kwanglong. They had believed Kwanglong could assert its dominance worldwide.

All those plans had crumbled.

Hao was in a daze for a while, but then he pulled himself together.

"Very well. In that case, we'll greedily seize various opportunities through legitimate means."

In his dimly lit office late at night, Hao made a resolute decision.
