August, who revealed such emotions, called out to the school staff and all the students and their families.

"Everyone, relax. Today is a wonderful, sunny day as our children are entering elementary school. On this auspicious day, there's no need for formal speeches. Let's celebrate our children's new beginnings to the fullest."

Upon hearing these words, the students and parents felt as if their entrance into the school was being blessed by the crown prince, and they were once again moved.

Observing the students and parents moved by such emotions, Octavia felt a sense of pride.

It was because she realized once again that her father was a remarkable person, highly respected by everyone.

Octavia was watching the proud crowd when, in the next moment, everything changed.

Several carriages arrived behind the royal family's carriage.

The gathering crowd stared at the carriages that had arrived after the royal family's, with accusatory glances.

Entering after the royal family? How disrespectful!

Such sentiments were evident in their gazes.

Exposed to such gazes, a girl jumped off the carriage as it came to a stop, coming out through the open door.

"Wow! Everyone's already gathered!"

"Hey, Sharl! I told you it's dangerous to jump off like that!"

"Sharl, please, be more ladylike!"

The assembly regarded the girl who had jumped off without parental escort with disdain. However, their eyes widened when they saw the man who followed and the woman who appeared to be the mother.

The ones who descended were none other than the modern world's greatest hero, Shin Wolford, known by various titles like 'Hero,' 'Demon King,' and 'God's Messenger,' and the renowned 'Saint,' Sicily Wolford.

It was known that the hero and the saint were married and had a child.

That meant the girl who had come down earlier was the daughter of the hero and the saint!

The crowd, who had thought it was strange for them to arrive after the royal family, quickly abandoned that notion.

"Huh? It's okay. Oh, Via-chan!"

The girl called Sharl, seeing Octavia, rushed over to her.

"Good morning! Your uniform looks great on you after all!"

Octavia, taken aback for a moment by Sharl's energetic greeting, soon smiled.

"Good morning, Sharl. You look great in your uniform too."

"Hehe, really? You think so?"

"You're saying it yourself."

"Well, that's because Papa, Mama, Grandpa, and Grandma all praise me for looking good in it."

The individuals Sharlotte mentioned were undoubtedly the hero, the saint, the sage, and the high priest.

At the mention of these prestigious names, the assembled crowd felt dizzy.

The daughter of the hero and the saint, the granddaughter of the sage and the high priest.

According to the rumors circulating in the commoners' world, the hero, Shin Wolford, is the illegitimate child of High Priest Ekaterina.

In other words, he's the high priest's grandchild.

Just how illustrious are her relatives! Those from noble families looked at Sharlotte, who was behaving in a manner that might be considered rude, as if they were beholding a celestial being.

To Sharlotte's side, two small figures rushed over.

"Sharl-chan, wait up!"

"...I'm sleepy."

Chasing after Sharlotte was Max, and Rain approached while yawning.

"Oh, Uncle August, Aunt Elizabeth, hello!"

"...Hi."

When Max referred to August and Elizabeth, who were with Sharlotte and Octavia, the assembled crowd immediately felt a heightened sense of tension.

Calling His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Her Royal Highness the Crown Princess "uncle" and "aunt" was a blatant display of disrespect!

Despite the fact that the individuals in question were children, especially among the faithful subjects of the royal family from noble houses, this behavior towards beloved royals elicited a feeling akin to anger.

However...

"Hehe, hello, Max, you seem energetic today as well."

"...Rain, can't you behave a little more formally?"

The so-called "Uncle" and "Aunt," the royal couple themselves, interacted with the children called Max and Rain as if they were their own relatives.

Could it be that these two are also the children of influential figures close to the royal family?

Thinking this, the crowd finally understood.

"Oh, Your Highness, Ellie, I'm sorry. Max, you shouldn't run ahead like that!"

"...Rain, can't you behave with a bit more energy?"

The mother was undoubtedly the most famous face among the Ultimate Magicians, the former poster girl of the "Stone Kiln Pavilion," and the current lady of the "Bean Workshop," Olivia. She was also Christina, who was once called the idol of the knight order and had served as His Majesty the King's guard at a young age.

It made sense that the child of the parents belonging to the Ultimate Magicians, led by Crown Prince August, and someone who had known August since childhood as a member of the Royal Guards, would exhibit such familiarity.

"Hey, Aug. The weather's turned out nicely."

With all the questions cleared up, the one who spoke was Shin, the current world's greatest hero. He was the person both nobles and commoners in Arlsheid admired, known for continuing the legacy of his grandmother, High Priest Merida, by creating magical devices that improved the citizens' lives.

Shin casually addressed August.

"Oh, it's a fitting day for our children's new beginning."

"I agree with that, but what's with this gathering?"

"It's like they're really staring at us..."

Following August, Siegfried, Rain's father, and Mark, Max's father, joined the conversation.

"It seems like they've come to welcome us."

To August's statement, Shin looked over the whole group as if he were impressed.

The assembly stiffened even more in Shin's sight compared to when they had greeted August earlier.

"Wow, they really respect you, don't they? The royal family, I mean."

"I don't know. It's hard to be genuinely happy when you say it."

"Why is that?"

Shin and August continued to chat happily, as if this were a scene from "A New Heroic Tale," the book that chronicled Shin's journey, in which they conversed as close friends, touching the hearts of those who watched.

Without any knowledge of the feelings of the assembly, Shin and the others shifted their focus to the children.

"Let's not linger here forever. We should head to the auditorium soon. Time's running out, isn't it?"

"That's right. Let's move to the auditorium, everyone. If we don't, the teachers will be in trouble. Via, Sharl, Max, Rain, let's go."

"Yes, yes!"

August said so and, accompanied by Shin and the children, headed toward the auditorium.

As for the group left behind at the scene...

"Oh, right, the entrance ceremony hasn't happened yet."

Having had their fill of the gathering with the royal family, the hero, and their children, they had completely forgotten about the entrance ceremony. with concepts
