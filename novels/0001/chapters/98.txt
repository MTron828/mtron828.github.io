The demon realm conquest operation was nearing its end.

The various countries within the alliance aimed to bring this crisis to a close as soon as possible. Cabinet ministers from each country gathered for the final negotiations. As communication devices had been distributed to each country, the representatives stayed at the meeting place in Darm for the duration of the discussions.

Several months had passed since the operation had been initiated, and the military forces sent by each country had already been reduced by half. All that remained was to encircle the old imperial capital at a distance that wouldn't provoke Strom and establish a surveillance network. This would bring the operation to a conclusion.

In case the demons made any suspicious moves in the future, Shin and the Ultimate Magicians would be ready to respond. Soldiers from various countries who had witnessed the previous battle against the demons trusted Shin and his group wholeheartedly, believing that if they could overpower the demons to that extent, they would handle anything that happened next. However, if something occurred without their knowledge, Shin and his team might not be able to manage it. That's why surveillance was necessary.

The completion of the surveillance network was believed by all to contribute to the safety and peace of humanity. However, Shin and his group were not immortal. Some voiced concerns about what would happen if the Ultimate Magicians were no longer around. Nevertheless, it was estimated that the number of demons wouldn't increase beyond the ones already present, as there were no reports of new demons being born. Thus, although the mission was entrusted to Shin and his team, the completion of the surveillance network marked the end of the demon realm conquest operation.

As the end came into view, discussions shifted to the next topic: the allocation of territory after the conclusion of the crisis. It was surprising that this topic, which had been previously settled, was brought up again. The reason for this became clear when the chairman representing Earlsheid addressed the assembly.

"Well then, we will now begin discussions on the redistribution of Darm's territory, as previously agreed upon. Is that acceptable?"

The cabinet ministers from various countries silently nodded in agreement, while only the Darm representative wore a bitter expression.

"..."

"Darm representative, is that acceptable?"

"Yes, it's okay."

During the demon realm conquest operation, a situation occurred where Ralph, the representative of Darm's army, went rogue and nearly let a demon escape. Of course, this wasn't the intention of Darm as a nation but rather the result of Ralph's personal actions.

However, individual actions and failures were not something that could be easily forgiven. With the power of Shin and the Ultimate Magicians, even if they had missed the demon at that time, they would eventually have been able to track it down. Nevertheless, it wasn't hard to imagine that the crisis for soldiers and civilians would have increased during that time. In other words, Ralph had been in a position to squash the early resolution of this emergency situation and bring unnecessary harm to humanity.

Given the potential danger that Ralph posed, Darm couldn't let him off the hook without consequences. The incident involving Ralph's rampage was already well-understood due to the interrogations that took place.

It was discovered that Ralph was critical of calling Shin "God's messenger" and Sistina "the saint." He had gone so far as to try to prevent Shin and the others from achieving feats and instead aimed to steal their glory. This infuriated Eise.

Eise, in spite of her respect for the Pope, Ekaterina, who had recognized Shin as God's messenger, was profoundly displeased by Ralph's attempts to undermine Shin's accomplishments. However, the representatives from Darm who were currently participating in this conference, including the king and other top officials, were favorable towards calling Shin "God's messenger." This put Darm in an unbelievable predicament due to the actions of the minority who denied Shin's role as God's messenger.

Although the fact that Ralph had gone rogue was not communicated to the general public, it was well known to the upper echelons. Darm was in danger of losing territory that should have rightfully been obtained, thanks to a small minority. Moreover, the loss of trust in Darm was paramount. This situation had even led to anger from individuals who had previously trusted Ralph.

This included the Darm representative present at the conference.

"(That misfortune maker! If only he had participated in the operation quietly, we could have expanded our territory without saying a word!)"

The representative of Darm watched the meeting proceed without his active involvement, all the while silently cursing Ralph in his mind, his expression filled with bitterness.

In the end, the land allocated to Darm was reduced by half from the original plan and redistributed to three countries: Swied, Canaan, and Kurt. Considering that their spiritual homeland, East, expressed discomfort, the Darm representative had no room for objection and had to simply nod in agreement. Despite rising to the level of a minister and becoming a representative of a nation like Darm, no rebuttal was allowed, and there was no room for negotiation.

What's more, the location of this conference happened to be in the Darm Kingdom again, which was solely due to its geographical convenience. It was a humiliating experience for the Darm Kingdom to host a world conference on its own soil. Furthermore, the Darm representative had also faced strong criticism from the East's representative. All of this had significantly wounded the pride of the Darm representative.

"Damn it, Ralph! What have you done?"

Since the conference took place in his own country, the Darm representative had returned to his residence. Upon his return, he began to kick and throw furniture in his room, unleashing the anger he had kept inside. Even his household staff, who were not accustomed to their usually composed master raising his voice so vehemently, and even his wife, did not dare approach his room, where loud noises could occasionally be heard.

"Haa... Haa... Damn it! How should I report this to His Majesty?"

Despite experiencing a miserable ordeal during the conference, he still had to report the conference's outcome to the king. The Darm representative felt a deep sense of dread at this daunting task. However, reporting it was an obligation he couldn't avoid.

Overwhelmed by anger and depression, the Darm representative's state of mind was far from normal at this moment. While he sat at his desk, head in hands, in his cluttered room, something inexplicable occurred.

"Aren't you angry?"

"!?"

Suddenly, he heard a voice that startled him, and he looked around. However, since his staff was avoiding him out of fear, there was no one in the room.

Was it just his imagination?

He considered that when he heard the voice again.

"Aren't you angry?"

"Who is it!? Come out!"

The Darm representative shouted involuntarily, but the owner of the voice remained hidden.

"Damn it! Who are you? Where are you hiding?"

"You haven't done anything wrong, yet you're blamed and belittled."

The voice had spoken what the Darm representative had been thinking deep within his mind.

"Yeah... I'm not at fault... All the blame lies with that madman Ralph."

Ralph, who had been highly trusted by everyone, was now referred to as a "madman" by the upper echelons of Darm due to his recent outburst.

"Yeah... It's his fault... It's all his..."

Had the Darm representative been in a stable state of mind at this moment, he might have noticed the dark magic that was pervading the room. However, his mental instability due to anger and depression, coupled with the suddenness of the voice addressing him, left him too frightened and bewildered to recognize the unnatural atmosphere in the room.

Consequently, the Darm representative gradually slipped into a hypnotic state and listened obediently to the voice of the unseen presence.

"Blame should have been on that man, not you."

"Yeah! Why do I have to endure this humiliation when I'm not at fault..."

"You're not at fault... You're not at fault..."

In this manner, enveloped in dark magic, the Darm representative listened to the voice of the unseen entity.

After a while, the Darm representative left his home on a carriage to report to the king. On the roof of his home, an observer had been watching his every move.

"Well, I hope it dances nicely as per the experiment."

The figure muttered and then disappeared. However, nobody saw who that figure was.

"I see... it has turned out as expected."

"Ah! I'm afraid so..."

Upon arriving at the royal castle, the Darm representative reported the results of the conference to the Darm king. Upon hearing this report, the Darm king wore a grave expression.

"Due to this recent incident, Darm's trust has plummeted drastically."

The king's self-deprecating words left the Darm representative at a loss for words.

"If anything, it is my fault... I failed to recognize the darkness in Ralph's heart and appointed him as the head of the military. All the blame lies with me."

The aging king, who had already reached the twilight of his years, appeared to have aged even more, perhaps due to the anguish he was experiencing.

"You've done well. The conference is likely to continue for a while. I understand it's a tough position, but I'm counting on you."

"Please... those words aren't necessary..."

To think that he was causing such distress to the kind-hearted king, who was a devout follower of the Creation God.

As a result, the Darm representative's anger and hatred towards Ralph intensified.

And from that night onwards, he would have a recurring dream.

Whenever he slept, the voice from that time would appear in his dreams.

And that voice would defend him, telling him that he wasn't at fault; there were others who were to blame.

In his extremely difficult situation, he sought salvation in the voice from his dreams.

Thus, he lowered his mental defenses.

If someone had peeked into his bedroom, they would have been paralyzed with fear.

This was because dark magic was entwined around him, manipulating the darkness in his heart.

However, no one observed this.

His wife, fearing his unusual behavior, even slept in a separate room.

Unnoticed by anyone, he was gradually consumed by the dark magic, withering away day by day.

His family members grew increasingly frightened by his condition, and some even stopped having meals with him.

The ministers of various nations noticed the extraordinary change in the Darm representative. However, they attributed it to the stress caused by the unfavorable nature of the conference for Darm.

Although they had noticed, as they were the ones pressing charges, they hesitated to reach out.

Everyone was aware of the man's odd behavior, but no one acted upon it.

As a result, nobody noticed the determination growing within the Darm representative.

"It's not my fault... it's... the one who made that decision..."

Within him, the culprit who had led him into this dire situation had already been identified.

And as the world prepared for spring and the start of a new fiscal year, it was nearly time for the surveillance network to be completed.
