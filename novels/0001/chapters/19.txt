The fact that a demon appeared, and that it was defeated, was quickly reported to the royal palace. Well, there were soldiers there, so they probably reported it immediately. When I returned home, a messenger from the royal palace had arrived.

"Welcome back, Lord Shin, His Highness Augustus, Lord Julius, Lord Thor, Lady Sicily, Lady Maria."

"I'm back, Alex."

"Lord Shin, we have a messenger from the royal palace."

"A messenger from the royal palace?"

"Of course, when a demon appears again, it causes quite a commotion at the royal palace. And if it's been defeated, they can't help but commend the one who did it."

"Sigh... It's going to be troublesome..."

"What are you saying, Lord Shin! It's only natural!"

"Alex?"

"When I heard that Lord Shin had defeated the demon, I was naturally worried, but we all felt extremely proud! Being commended is only natural!"

The other gatekeeper nodded vigorously as well.

"I see..."

Passing by the excited Alex and the others, Shin entered his home. Inside, there was a man who appeared to be a messenger from the royal palace and an elderly man named Dis.

"Hey, Dis, what are you doing here? The messenger is frozen stiff."

"Hmm, given the circumstances, I thought I should personally speak with you, Lord Shin, Merlin, and Master Merida."

"Why?"

"But before that... Hey, the usual notice."

"Yes! Lord Shin Wolford! In the face of the national crisis caused by the appearance of a demon, you risked your own life to defeat it! As a result, the Kingdom of Alsheid wishes to express its gratitude and has decided to award you the 'First-Class Merit' medal. We would like Lord Shin Wolford to attend the award ceremony!"

He said it all at once. But a medal... The atmosphere between Grandpa and Grandma changed at those words.

"Disem... You said you wouldn't use Shin for political purposes. So what's this treatment about?"

"I heard that too... What's going on?"

Grandpa and Grandma looked scary. Everyone held their breath in an atmosphere they had never felt before.

"That's exactly why I came."

Dis explained the reason he was here.

"This time, after several decades, a demon has appeared again. The last time a demon appeared, the Kingdom of Alsheid was on the brink of destruction. The people of this country never forget that threat. And that threat has appeared once again. This information has already reached the ears of many citizens, and the fact that it was defeated immediately is also known. For this country, the appearance and defeat of a demon are matters that cannot be kept hidden."

"I understand that, but what about the awarding of the medal?"

"Well, Lord Merlin and Lady Merida were awarded medals when they defeated a demon, and it wouldn't be right not to award one for the same achievement."

"Hmm..."

"Certainly, that makes sense, but..."

I see, so it's the same for Grandpa and Grandma based on their actions. That's why it would be strange not to award them the same medal. I understand why the medals are being awarded, but still...

"Of course, there may be those who want to take advantage of this, but I will do everything in my power to prevent it. I can even make that declaration at the award ceremony. So, can you please allow this? Not for my sake, but for the sake of the nation!"

With that, he bowed deeply.

"Your Majesty!"

"Father..."

The messenger and Augustus were also surprised. It's understandable because the king, whom they hold in the highest regard, bowed to an ordinary old man. It's no wonder they're surprised.

"Lord Merlin, Lady Merida, I also implore you. Please grant your permission."

"Even His Highness!"

Augustus also bowed. Seeing that, the messenger...

"P-Please, grant your permission!"

...bowed as well.

The king, the crown prince, and the messenger all bowed, and Grandpa and Grandma had troubled expressions. But eventually...

"...Alright. Disem, I will trust your words. If you go back on them, we will leave this country. We will have no further dealings with it. Is that acceptable?"

"Understood. That's fine."

"Also, a king doesn't bow so easily."

"I judged that it was necessary in this case."

"But really... one trouble after another... it's unbelievable."

"It's not my fault, is it?"

"That's right, it's never boring when you're with Shin."

"Um... I'm sorry... I'm partly responsible for the trouble..."

"Cecily, you don't have to worry about it. It's all because of her that we get into these kinds of troubles."

"It's not my fault!"

As I shouted that, everyone looked at me with pitying eyes. What's going on?

"Well, it's true that I often get involved in trouble. This time is a prime example. Would you like to hear the details?"

I was asked about the recent incident, so I mainly explained the course of events, with everyone occasionally adding details. And then...

"Artificially turned into a demon!?"

Dis was astonished. But it didn't seem like he found it hard to believe. What's going on?

"Is that certain?"

"No, it's just a guess. There's no concrete evidence."

"Hmm... This is..."

Dis had a troubled expression. Well, it's understandable when you hear something like this.

"Shin, Augustus, Thor, Julius, Cecily, Maria, I command you to keep this a secret. Do not disclose it to anyone, understood?"

He emphasized the need for secrecy.

"Alright, but we already told our S-Class classmates and the homeroom teacher."

"We'll handle that on our end. We'll send messengers to each of them to ensure they don't speak about it."

"I understand. I really wanted to tell them myself..."

"I'm sorry, but we need to handle this swiftly."

With that, Dis left. He said he would contact us later about the award ceremony schedule.

And it seems the investigation into this matter will begin. The Ritzberg family will also be investigated. The fate of Kurt's father has not been decided yet.

Based on the evidence, Kurt's rampage was undoubtedly the cause. However, they will hold the Ritzberg family accountable for allowing Kurt to leave the house, despite his house arrest, and for not noticing his transformation. There's also the possibility of leniency due to the potential involvement of the family in human experiments. All of this will be addressed in the future.

One thing is certain, though: the Undersecretary, who currently serves in the Treasury, will resign. After that, it's likely that he'll return to his territory, which is the general expectation.

The nobles in this country all have their own territories. So why do they all live in the capital city and work in government offices?

This dates back to the founding of the kingdom. At that time, those who had made significant contributions to the kingdom's establishment were granted land in various regions and became nobles. To demonstrate their loyalty and prevent uprisings, they were required to have their families reside in the capital city. They would entrust their estates to stewards, hold key positions in the government, and spend more than half of their lives in the capital.

This was not a compulsory measure, but rather a voluntary one practiced by the nobles. While there was no punishment for not having their families reside in the capital, it would lead to a strained relationship with other nobles.

By the way, Cecily, Maria, Thor, and Julius's families also own territories.

Cecily's family has a town at the foot of a mountain, known for its hot springs and the vacation homes of other nobles. It's a popular tourist destination, and while the town isn't very large, it generates a considerable amount of tax revenue. They invest heavily in public projects, ensuring a steady flow of tourists, and the town has been growing larger every year.

Maria's family resides in a coastal town where fishing and maritime trade thrive. It's known for delicious seafood and is a popular destination for travelers who enjoy both fishing and gourmet experiences. With its bustling maritime industry, the town has a foreign, exotic atmosphere.

Thor's family lives in a town that doesn't have any particular specialty, but they focus on nurturing craftsmen, making the town's products a kind of brand.

Julius's family resides in a resort-like area surrounded by the sea and mountains. In the summer, it offers camping, barbecues, hiking, and in the winter, skiing on the mountains. There are beaches that stretch out endlessly, and various resort facilities, including resorts, luxury condominiums, and more. Spending vacations in this area is considered prestigious among nobles.

A samurai's resort...

During extended breaks, many of them visit their respective territories. So, they talked about going to each other's territories at some point.

The samurai's resort...

The next day, they discussed the matter of how to handle transportation, and in the end, they decided to continue the carriage service.

The reason for this was for my sake.

"Look, look! It's Lord Shin!"

"That's the new hero..."

"Sigh... he looks so cool."

"Who's that person with him?"

"As expected, for someone like Lord Shin, there's already a chosen one."

"I'm so jealous..."

As Dis mentioned yesterday, the people of Alsheid already knew that there was someone who had defeated a demon. It's part of their nature to highly respect Grandpa and Grandma, so it was easy to imagine that people would come closer to me when they found out that the grandson of the hero who defeated the demon was present. That's why, with Cecily and Maria accompanying me, there wouldn't be any unnecessary interference from others.

This was also at Grandma's suggestion, and Cecily and Maria's parents agreed with it.

"I'm sorry, Cecily, Maria... for kind of making you act like bodyguards."

"It's okay. Don't worry about it."

"That's right. We owe a lot to Shin, so this is no big deal."

"Exactly."

"But still..."

"Actually, I'm with Shin because it's my own choice. Please don't ignore my wishes."

These were the words I received when I mentioned the idea of Cecily serving as my escort.

"You would say that, wouldn't you?"

"Haha, of course, I would."

"Sigh... this outsider feeling... Should I exclude myself?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Right. There's no such thing as excluding these guys."

"These guys..."

Maria sighed while holding her head. It's unthinkable that Maria would be an outsider.

Amidst these conversations, we arrived at the academy. I had felt people's eyes on us even while on the way to school. I was definitely being watched.

I could tell that people were whispering, even though I couldn't hear what they were saying.

"Ugh... it's annoying."

"That can't be helped. After all, you're the newly emerged hero."

"If I were in a different class, I might have come to see."

"Stop it..."

When we entered the classroom, I finally felt more at ease. It was the same people who had heard my story yesterday. They treated me as usual.

"Good morning, Shin."

"Good morning, Lord Shin."

"Lord Shin, good morning."

Everyone was normal, which was a relief.

"Hey... a messenger from the country came to my house yesterday..."

"They came to my house too."

"Mine as well."

"Me too."

Alice had already arrived at school today.

"I was watching the town's atmosphere on the way to school, and everyone was in high spirits. They were celebrating the birth of a new hero."

"I saw that too, but after hearing yesterday's story..."

"Yeah. It's hard to feel happy about it."

"My family asked me about it, and when I told them as much as I could, they got really excited... I couldn't be happy about it, so they gave me weird looks."

It seems everyone has their own thoughts about the situation. But they all share the same feeling. Just having that sense of camaraderie and not being treated as someone special was already comforting.

"Alright, everyone, take your seats. We're starting soon!"

Teacher Alfred came, and homeroom began as usual. Since he was there yesterday as well, everything proceeded as usual.

"Yesterday's commotion has the entire academy buzzing. Wolfort, especially you, should be careful, you know? If possible, stay with other students and try not to be alone. You might get surrounded."

"Shin, seriously, don't be alone. You might panic if you're surrounded."

"Huh? Seriously?"

"I'm serious."

Everyone nodded.

I see... so it's gotten to that point. I thought people were just whispering about it from a distance.

"Try to stick with one of the girls if you can. If you're with only guys, you'll get surrounded by girls."

"Really?"

"Yeah, try being surrounded by girls you don't even know. It's a hassle..."

It feels like they're all quite convinced... well, Oug is a prince, so he probably gets surrounded at parties and such.

"Ugh... this is troublesome."

"Just give up. The ceremony for the decoration will make things even more chaotic."

"Is that so..."

It's getting more and more significant.

Today, there was a briefing for the research clubs that we couldn't attend yesterday. Afterward, things got hectic.

"Wolfort-kun! Please, please join our 'Attack Magic Research Club'!"

"What are you talking about! I'm personally being taught enchantment magic by Merida-sama! He is the most suitable for our 'Quality of Life Improvement Research Club'!"

"No, no, I heard that you personally delivered the final blow to the Demon yesterday with a sword. Someone who can use such amazing body-enhancement magic should join the 'Physical Enhancement Research Club.'"

"Wolfort-kun! You're the grandson of a hero, and there's no one more suitable for our 'Hero Research Club'! Please, come to our club!"

The recruitment for the research clubs was intense.

In the end, I had to explain that I couldn't join because I had already started my own research club. The senior students were disappointed but eventually left. However, now there were many applications from my classmates who wanted to join.

"Um, um! I heard that Wolfort-kun started a research club!"

"I want to join too!"

"Me too!"

"I do too!"

"Wait a moment! I can't understand if you all say it all at once!"

Since so many of them wanted to join, I couldn't handle it, so I left the decision of membership to Teacher Alfred.

It seems he set a minimum requirement for joining because he couldn't accept everyone. The condition he set was the ability to use dimensional storage.

It was the most reasonable condition, as all S-class students could use it, and it had a moderate level of difficulty.

In the end, two students from Class A joined the research club, while there were none from Classes B and C.

The two of them were childhood friends, a boy and a girl named Mark Bean and Olivia Stone. They were the son of a blacksmith and the daughter of a diner owner.

They learned dimensional storage during their middle school years when they discovered their magical talents, mainly to assist with deliveries and shopping.

Feeling exhausted from all the commotion, I returned to the classroom.

"You felt it, right?"

"Yeah... it was quite an experience."

"It must have been tough."

"Sorry... we couldn't help with the recruitment."

"No, it's not your fault."

"Well, now we've overcome one of the difficulties. Hopefully, there won't be any more commotions until the decoration ceremony."

That's what Oug said. After all, normal classes would resume afterward, and there wouldn't be such events. I just need to be careful. That's what I thought.

I never expected things to get this hectic next.

In the conference room at the royal palace, King Diseum, Dominic, the head of the Military Affairs Bureau, and Dennis Willer, the head of the Security Bureau, were present.

The Military Affairs Bureau was responsible for external threats, such as foreign invaders and monsters, while the Security Bureau handled internal security and pacification, similar to a police force.

They were discussing the information relayed by Shin.

"What! There's a possibility that the Demon was artificially created!?"

"Well, it's Shin's direct impression from the battle. Considering the circumstances leading up to it, it doesn't seem far-fetched."

"And... the possibility of artificially increased monsters?"

"Yes, it was after hearing Dominic's report, so I had a hunch there could be a connection."

"Someone is plotting something..."

"We don't know who or where, but hopefully, the investigation will reveal more."

"This could turn into a serious situation."

"We won't let that happen! Dominic, Dennis, the Military Affairs Bureau and the Security Bureau need to cooperate and thoroughly investigate this matter. Don't overlook anything!"

"Understood!"

After King Diseum left the conference room, Dominic and Dennis were left behind.

"However, when I first heard your report, I couldn't believe it..."

"We never dreamed that it would come to creating demons."

"If we thoroughly investigate the surroundings of the Ritzberg family's heir who became a demon, we'll surely uncover some wrongdoing. We'll definitely expose their crimes!"

"That's right. We won't hesitate to cooperate as well."

Both of them felt intense anger toward the unseen malevolence.
