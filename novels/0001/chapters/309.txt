orm names
for my fantasy football team with a frog theme

The seasons have changed, and the academy has entered its summer break.

Even the energetic and somewhat anxious Shal seems to have made many friends other than Via-chan at the elementary school, and she joyfully tells me what happened today every day.

She is an honest child, whether it's a good or bad aspect, so I'm relieved because she doesn't seem to be forcing herself.

Silver seems to be enjoying learning magic, and his relationship with Allen-kun and others is also good, so it seems like he's having a fun time at the academy every day.

Both of them are my children, so I was worried that there might be some jealousy or animosity, but so far, it seems that no one has openly expressed such feelings.

Alicia-chan scolded Shal because her attitude towards Via-chan exceeded Alicia-chan's tolerance, not as a taunt to the Walford family but purely because of Shal's behavior.

She's a bit harsh, but children like her are appreciated by Shal, so I'm grateful that their friendship continues unchanged.

My second son, Sean, said he wants to practice using magical tools, but it seems to be difficult for a three-year-old, and he repeats the challenge, failure, and tears every day.

Well, Shal already had magical toys and didn't start using them until she was about five, so it's not a problem if he can't use them now.

Anyway, he seems to want to play with a Magiccon car and is working hard to practice with magical tools without getting bored.

Nova-sama, the prince of Oug, is also practicing with magical tools for the same reason as Sean.

With that in mind, the summer break came in no time.

During my time at the Advanced Magic Academy, it became a tradition to spend some time at Julius's family resort in Littenheim during the summer, and we are planning to head there in a few days.

And today, on the second day of the summer break, we are visiting the former imperial capital, which is now part of the current Earlshide territory.

The purpose is...to visit a grave.

The former imperial capital was turned into a ghost town, with all the residents being brutally murdered by demons and monsters when we entered, and not a single person was left.

"Ha, ha."

I never expected that there would be two moms...I thought that in most cases, when siblings without blood ties find out about this fact, they become distant. However, Shal didn't change her attitude even after learning this fact. Maybe it was because she was young, but for Shal, whether there was a blood connection didn't seem to matter. Silver was her brother, neither more nor less. More importantly, Shal considered Silvia as her mom, someone who was kind and nurturing, always smiling, and above all, a source of comfort. At first, Shal didn't seem to understand it, but as she grew, she began to envy Silver, who had two people like that. I feel incredibly relieved by Shal's positive and open-minded perspective. To be honest, I was worried that as they grew up and realized they were not blood-related siblings, things might get complicated. In Earlshide Kingdom, siblings without a blood connection can legally marry. In fact, Via, who Silver adores, openly states that Shal is like a close friend and a sister, but she's very wary of Silver. They are together as a family 24/7, so she's concerned that their familial affection might turn into romantic feelings. However, well, based on Shal's behavior, I don't think that's going to happen. While we were discussing this, Silver finished paying his respects and returned to us. "Sorry for the wait, Mom, Dad." "Ah, did you greet them properly?" "Yeah." "Good, then what shall we do? Shall we explore the city a bit?" "Exploring! I want to explore the new city!" "Me too!" After finishing our visit to the graves, Silvia suggested that we should go and see the new city. Shal and Sean immediately showed their enthusiasm to explore. "That sounds like a plan. Let's explore the new city together and see what it has to offer." "Yes!" "Yay!" With the enthusiastic responses from Silver, Shal, and Sean, our decision to explore the new city was made.

"All right, everyone, hold hands so you don't get lost."

When Silvia said that, Shal held Silver's right hand, and Sean held his left.

"Huh? Wait a minute, I can't use my hands."

"No! Big brother, you can't let go of little sister's hand!"

"Me too!"

In response to Silver's protests, Shal and Sean adamantly refused to let go of his hands, even though both of his hands were occupied.

As expected, there was no need to worry about these three. Whether or not there was a blood connection, big brother was big brother, and little sister and little brother were little sister and little brother. This relationship was not going to change.

Silver, who had been easily dismissed, chuckled and spoke to the two.

"Okay, so we can't let go of each other's hands, right?"

"Yeah!"

Shal and Sean energetically replied and began walking while holding Silver's hand.

"Hey! Wait a second! Don't do something that might make you get lost starting from the one who said it!!"

"Oh dear, calm down."

Hastily chasing after the three, Silvia and I had smiles on our faces that contradicted our words.
