 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

Intense combat was taking place in the courtyard of the Yuukou Palace.

As we landed there, we couldn't help but doubt our eyes at the sight. In that place, many soldiers surrounded Hao, who had enveloped his entire body in magic power.

However, Hao seemed unaffected by the attacks of the numerous soldiers. He deflected attacks with barrier spells and unleashed magic with his overflowing magical power. The soldiers, in turn, defended themselves with protective spells. It was clear that the overwhelming number of soldiers was being pressured by Hao.

"Hahaha!! This is amazing! With this power and these weapons, this country will be mine!"

Tch! So Hao's goal is to seize the railgun, after all.

Furthermore, he seemed to be intoxicated by the newfound ability to use magic, even openly discussing his intention to usurp the country. When someone who has never had power suddenly gains it, they become intoxicated by that power.

Unintentionally, the situation mirrored the conversation we had in the carriage earlier. Until now, Hao had held political power but had no military power. His newfound magical abilities seemed to have intoxicated him with this newfound strength.

"Tch! Watching a guy like that reminds me of the commoner magic users who attacked Swied."

Those guys also became arrogant after gaining power abruptly and left Strom to attack Swied. This guy gives off the same vibe as those magic users.

It was at that moment we thought we should join the battle as well.

"What!? His Highness August!?"

A loud voice cried out, and it was the general we had met during the day. When the general spotted us, he hurriedly came over to us.

"Why is His Highness August here!?"

"Well, I heard that Hao's house was on fire. I went to the scene, but when I heard that Hao had fled and was headed for the Yuukou Palace, I came here."

"Even if you put it that way, it's not like you're going out for a quick shopping trip..."

Coming here with such a casual attitude to a battlefield must have been beyond their wildest dreams.

The general had a deeply perplexed expression on his face.

"Despite appearances, we have been through quite a chaotic situation. No need to worry."

"Is that so?"

"Yeah. By the way, it seems like they are having quite a struggle, but should we lend a hand?"

When August mentioned that, the general hesitated for a moment and then shook his head.

"No, there's no need for that. This is our country's issue. We can't accept assistance from an emissary from another country and a royal highness."

The general looked straight at August and said so.

"I see. I must have said something presumptuous. I apologize."

"We appreciate Your Highness's kind offer. Please don't take offense."

"I understand. But if things get dangerous, I will intervene."

"We will do our best to prevent that."

With that, the general headed back to the battlefield.

"You all! Are you planning to make a fool of yourselves in front of His Highness August, an emissary from another country!? How do you think His Highness will perceive this? If we let the soldiers of Kwan Long, whom the Western World already belittles as poorly trained cowards, mock us, what will become of our dignity as the country's defenders?"

When the general said this, the soldiers' morale visibly rose. Making a fool of themselves in front of an emissary from another country was nothing but shame for the country's soldiers.

However...

"Well, I don't think they should be boasting about it..."

August was puzzled by the fact that he was used as a tool to inspire the soldiers. Normally, speaking like that could worsen relations between nations.

"Never mind. Thanks to that, it seems like the soldiers' morale has improved."

In fact, the soldiers, who had been somewhat overwhelmed just a while ago, were now pressuring Hao in return.

"Argh! From behind!? How cowardly!"

"Shut up and be bound quietly!"

"Do you have no pride as soldiers defending the nation!? Come at me head-on!"

"What is this scum saying!"

The general's words seemed to have touched a nerve with Hao. The quality of Hao's magical power changed again. There was something rather dark mixed in.

This is...

"August, this might be bad."

"Yeah, this is not a good sign. Hey, there's a possibility that something unexpected might happen. Everyone, get ready."

"Yes!"

Upon August's words, we transitioned from a watching stance to a combat-ready posture. This way, we could respond immediately if something happened.

While we were preparing for battle, Hao's magical power continued to swell.

"I am the one who will become the emperor of this country! Those who oppose me are the real rebels!"

"Pitiful, you're even saying such things now!"

"Grrr... Aaaahhh!"

"Ugh!"

Hao, incited by the general, seemed to have finally reached his breaking point. He released a large amount of magical power, pushing away the surrounding soldiers. The general was also knocked down.

"Oh no!"

Naturally, Hao didn't miss this opportunity. He broke through the soldiers' encirclement and reached the railgun in the courtyard.

"Hahaha... With this... this... the country will be mine..."

...His tone was gradually becoming more ominous.

This might be a serious problem.

"Wait! Wolforde, why are you so calm!? He has even reached that weapon!"

"Your Highness, why are you so composed!?"

I noticed something was wrong with Hao, and as Mark and Yuri voiced their concern, I replied, "Well, I thought it's not a problem if Shin is composed."

"Wolforde?"

"What do you mean?"

When August explained why he wasn't panicking, Mark and Yuri looked towards me.

Come to think of it, I never actually told them anything about it. Is it weird that I'm so composed?

"Well, I don't know. I just have a feeling that the weapon probably won't activate."

"How can you know something like that!?"

"Huh? A hunch, maybe?"

"Huh?"

Yuri had a truly dumbfounded expression on her face.

Well, I did say it was a hunch, but I'm fairly certain it won't activate.

No, it might activate.

"Haha! Die... Die!"

While this conversation was going on, Hao aimed the railgun at the soldiers and activated it by channeling his magic power into it.

"Ugh! Everyone, shield yourselves!"

"Hahaha, too late!"

Upon the general's command, the soldiers immediately deployed defensive spells. Regardless, Hao activated the magical device without a care in the world.

The soldiers curled up their bodies in preparation for the incoming impact and hid behind their defensive spells.

But...

After a while, confusion spread across the faces of the soldiers. Since the expected impact didn't happen, it was only natural.

They exchanged glances with one another, and their collective gaze turned towards Hao with even greater confusion.

The railgun had made a "buuun" sound, indicating activation, but nothing more happened.

Hao, who had initiated the activation, was also puzzled.

Well, that's only natural.

Because, you see...

There were no bullets inside.

"Why... why isn't it working like before?"

Hao was perplexed by the fact that the weapon he had considered his trump card wasn't delivering the expected results, and he continued to channel his magic power frantically.

"I don't really get it, but now's the time! Seize Hao!"

And the general wasn't one to let this opportunity slip by. With the general's command, the soldiers who had been bewildered just moments ago rushed towards Hao.

In no time, they managed to restrain Hao.

"Let go! Let go!"

Despite Hao's loud protests, there was no way the soldiers would release their grip on him.

Several people restrained Hao, pressing him down and binding his hands behind his back.

"Phew, he gave us quite a hard time."

The general finally showed a relieved expression but immediately tightened his face and stood in front of Hao.

"Hao, I confirm that you conspired against His Majesty the Emperor, attempting to usurp the throne. Therefore, you are now a major criminal guilty of high treason, and you will be executed for your crimes."

In a calm voice, the general said this to Hao. Then, with a mocking smile, he added, "You must be feeling pretty good about yourself."

Perhaps that one word served as the trigger. The quality of magical power enveloping Hao's body underwent a dramatic change. Just a while ago, it had a somewhat murky feeling, but now it was completely pitch-black.

"You... bastards! You bastards! You bastards!"

Hao shouted and released the dark magical power recklessly into his surroundings.

Ah... this sight was all too familiar.

This is...

"Kind of reminds me of when Kurt turned into a demon," Maria said.

Most likely, everyone felt the same way. No one denied Maria's words. And then...

"What the hell!?"

"Whoa!"

"Ugh!"

The soldiers who had been restraining Hao were once again blown away. The general, facing this for the second time, managed to hold his ground this time, but he was still bewildered by what had happened to Hao.

The same confusion was visible in the faces of the surrounding soldiers as they exchanged glances.

However, we understood what had happened to Hao. It was something we had encountered before, something we had dealt with numerous times. In other words...

"Seems like he turned into a demon after all."

That's right. Hao had indeed turned into a demon. a story
