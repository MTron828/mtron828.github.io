Grandpa and Grandma are coming to the training camp with us.

I conveyed that information to everyone before the joint training.

"Wow! We get the honor of having the Sage and the High Priest as our camp supervisors!"

"Come to think of it, I hadn't considered the idea of having supervisors."

"I actually thought you had someone in mind already by yesterday..."

Thor is expressing his displeasure to Aug. Well, I hadn't thought of it either.

Coming out of the remote mountains just a few months ago, I still haven't fully adapted to the concepts of royalty and nobility in this world. People like King Aug, Uncle Dis, nobles like Shishiri and Maria, and even Julius, are far from the arrogant nobles in the stories of my previous life. I end up treating them as regular people and often forget their positions. Even Aug occasionally forgets that he is a king while at the academy.

In this world, local governance often relies on a system of nobility due to various circumstances. This is because the transportation and communication networks are not as advanced as they were in my previous life. It takes time to communicate with remote areas, so local governance is entrusted to the discretion of the noble lords. There are exceptions, of course.

So, I need to get used to the concept of royalty and nobility...

"It's quite challenging to figure out what we need to be cautious about regarding royalty and nobility."

"Are you saying you want to go to a country with neither, Shin?"

"Huh? Oh, Els Free Commercial Union, perhaps..."

That's right, this country is the only exception in this world. Els Free Commercial Union is a republic. Instead of noble lords, people from among the townsfolk run for governor and are elected through elections. Furthermore, a president is selected from among the governors. So, there are no nobles or royalty in this country, only commoners. It's a republic, but in terms of delegating authority to regional governors, it's not much different from a monarchy, considering the transportation and communication situations are the same. However, because many of the governors and presidents were originally merchants, negotiations with this country can be very challenging, as I learned in class.

"Shin, do you want to go to Els?"

"Huh? No, it's not like that at all!"

Shishiri asked with tears in her eyes.

"Is that so? I thought you might be leaving us behind to go to Els."

By the way, the number of monsters doesn't seem to be decreasing at all. At this rate, I wonder what's happening in the former Imperial territory. I can't help but think of the hardships of the scouting unit that brought back the information we heard yesterday.

Returning to the gathering place in front of the capital gates, I notice that there are knight academy students who seem down, just like on the first day.

"Hey, what's going on with this?"

"Oh, Shin-kun. Well, because the Sage and the High Priest are coming for the training camp, our spirits were high, and then... Lady Alice and the knight academy students defeated all the monsters before we, the shield-wielders, had a chance."

"We didn't even get a turn."

"Oh, I'm sorry..."

It seems they are even more dejected than on the first day.

"Seems like Tony's group was fine."

"Well, it's training, and they understand the role of knights well."

"That's right."

"So, this time it's just Alice."

"Uh, I'm really sorry!"

Despite occasional failures, the joint training proceeds smoothly. The academy has now entered its summer break.

Summer break lasts for two months, during which there is no joint training. During this time, there are no assignments, but there is an order to work on self-improvement and show growth beyond what we were before the break. So, although there are no assignments, it seems like there won't be much time for leisure, as not working on self-improvement could affect our evaluations after the break.

The "Ultimate Magic Research Society" plans to use this long vacation to hold a training camp and further level up. However, since unmarried young men and women will be sharing accommodations, my grandparents will accompany us as guardians. So, the three of us, my grandparents and I, went to greet the participants at their homes.

Everyone was in a great uproar because the two heroes had come to their houses. The only ones who weren't making a fuss were Uncle Dis, Shishiri, and Maria's parents, as they were already acquainted. Thor and Julius's parents were even shedding tears.

We also went to Shishiri's parents' place, where we will be staying in the estate as a gesture of thanks.

"Sorry about this, it's our granddaughter's whims that led us to use the estate."

"Truly sorry."

"Oh, no! Please, raise your heads, Wise One! High Priest! We're more than delighted to be able to assist your two grandchildren. This is for the greater good of the world. Even though we take pride in it, there's not the slightest inconvenience in it!"

"Yes, we are very happy. What Shin-kun is striving for is to save the world, and being able to contribute to that is a joy that will be talked about for generations."

Cecil and Irene are quite cooperative for this training camp. When they say that, it makes me nervous...

"What do you think? This child has a tendency to get carried away when given this kind of freedom..."

"Well, I mean..."

Grandpa, please don't agree!

"Well, I'll keep a close eye on this child to make sure they don't do anything foolish. But if they do something, please forgive them."

"Grandma, can't you have a little more trust in your grandchild?"

"What are you talking about? Trusting them based on their previous actions is an impossible request! Please, do your best to behave yourself."

"Uh... yeah, I'll try... maybe?"

"It's really worrisome..."

Grandma let out a deep sigh.

"High Priest, Shin-kun is a kind and good child. He wouldn't do anything reckless for sure."

"Yes, that's right. He's worked so hard for Shishiri, there's no way he'd do something strange."

"You're too lenient. This child has a bad habit of immediately executing ideas that even we can't fully understand. Moreover, the things he comes up with often go beyond our comprehension."

Cecil and Irene defended me, but Grandma brushed it off.

"Is that so?"

"Yeah, that's right. The defensive magical tools you both are wearing were created by this child, right?"

"Yes, that's correct. These tools have saved our lives multiple times."

"What?! Is that true, Father!?"

"Yeah, I didn't tell you because I didn't want to worry Shishiri, but on our way back to the territory, we were attacked by monsters several times, and there were moments when we would have been in danger if it weren't for these magical tools."

"When I heard that story from the master, I felt grateful to Shin-kun many times. Thank you, Shin-kun, I want to thank you again."

"Oh, no, I'm just happy I could be of help."

That's a good supporting shot. Is this heading in the right direction?

"I see, that's good to hear. There's nothing I'd be happier about than this child's creations being helpful."

"That's right!"

"What do you think of the magical tools you've used?"

"Thoughts? Well, I was certainly impressed that they were created by the High Priest's grandchild..."

"I don't mean that kind of impression. I mean, how do they compare to the defensive magical tools available on the market?"

"Well... honestly, I felt an immense difference compared to the ones available in the market. I've never seen magical tools like these before."

"How long did it take this child to create them?"

"As I recall, it's done in an instant..."

At that point, Cecil freezes.

"That's right. This child can easily create even such magical tools. And it's often done on a whim. It's dangerous if we don't keep an eye on it."

...

Oh no! Cecil fell silent! But hang in there!

"Well, that's the way it is. We'll watch to make sure this child doesn't do anything reckless, but please be prepared."

"I understand, I'll be ready..."

"Well... since magical practice is done in the wilderness, it should be fine."

Grrr! I couldn't say anything as Grandma glared at me.

"Grandpa..."

"Yes?"

"Grandma, she's scary..."

"Ho ho... I know it all too well..."

The two of us followed Grandma back home with our heads hanging low.

It was scary...

And the next day, because I had opened the gates after visiting everyone's houses, I went to pick everyone up one by one, and we all gathered at my house.

I guess it's a taxi after all...

I couldn't help but worry, but I met up with Grandpa and Grandma and headed to the carriage stand.

This time, we were going to return through the gate, so we chartered carriages to our destinations. It was because if we used our own carriages, they would become unnecessary once we arrived.

We chartered carriages instead of riding together because there were individuals like Aug, a royal, and my grandparents, who would cause a commotion if they encountered regular citizens.

By the way, Aug covered the cost of this charter because I was the one who caused the need for it.

There were three six-passenger carriages and one fourteen-passenger carriage, so we split into groups of four, four, and six.

I rode in the six-passenger carriage with Grandpa, Grandma, Aug, Shishiri, and Maria.

Thor and Julius were told they'd be fine since Aug and my grandparents were with us, so they got on a different carriage with Rine and Alice.

Mark and Olivia were together in one carriage, and Tony and Yuri rode together.

The journey in the carriages was expected to last about two days, during which the carriages would run continuously.

"All day long, and the horses are okay?"

After the carriage started moving, I became worried about the horses pulling it, so I asked.

"Don't worry, haven't you seen all the gear on the horses?"

"Oh, right, there was quite a bit."

"That gear provides various enhancements, like fatigue recovery and physical ability boosts."

"And thanks to that gear, the horses can run for long hours without any issues, significantly reducing travel time for long distances."

"The development of these magical tools with such enhancements was done by none other than Lord Merida."

"Grandma did that?"

"What's the matter? You didn't know?"

"I've never heard of it."

"Lord Merida shifted the focus from combat-oriented magical tools to developing tools that improve our daily lives, greatly enhancing our quality of life."

"We respectfully address Lord Merida as a 'Teacher' because they have contributed to making people's lives more convenient and comfortable and have led them to a better life."

"We were born into this lifestyle, but our grandparents and parents always talk about how the world has become more convenient."

"Oh, I see."

I was curious about why everyone called my grandma a 'Teacher.'

To me, she was just a kind but scary grandma.

"What's up, Shin? You're staring."

"Well, I was just thinking about how amazing you were back then."

"What are you talking about? That's all in the past."

Grandma blushed and turned away.

"You don't have to be shy."

"Ho ho, I've never been one to accept praise easily, even back in the day."

"Huh, but I can imagine it."

"You guys! Cut it out!"

The carriage journey continued happily and smoothly.

But as expected, when you're traveling long distances, you start to encounter something: while the carriages continued moving, the detection magic that had been deployed detected a reaction from some monsters.

"Monsters. I think they're medium-sized, and there are about five of them."

"Yes, I see five."

We communicated with the other carriages and decided to stop the carriages for a moment.

Everyone got out of the carriages.

"Monsters have appeared."

Alice said as she got off the carriage.

"What should we do? I think even one person should be fine for this, but who's going to take care of it?"

Thor asked, and everyone exchanged glances.

"I want to do it!"

"No, I'll handle it."

"I want to do it, too."

Everyone raised their hands, expressing their desire to take care of the monsters.

"Well then..."

With everyone looking at me, I made a proposal.

"Let's draw lots."

Saying that, I took out some lots from the extradimensional storage.

"Why do you always have lottery tickets ready..."

I couldn't answer Thor's question.

Why was it again?

"Well, let's draw the lots quickly."

Everyone drew lots, and during that time, the monsters had come closer to a visible range. Were those mountain dog-like monsters?

"I got it. I won."

"Aww, I lost."

Lyn won the lottery.

"Well, Lyn, please go."

"Got it, leave it to me."

She said that and headed toward the monsters.

Gathering magical power, she activated wind magic.

The wind blade, generated instantly through non-chanting and powerful magic, swiftly cut through the mountain dog-like monsters.

"Oh, you're starting magic a lot faster now."

"Heh, it was a piece of cake."

"But, isn't that a bit overkill? You could use less magic, and it would still work. If you did that, you'd be even faster."

"I see. I'll be more careful next time."

"Next is me!"

"No, let's draw lots again. Except for Lyn."

"That's harsh; I want to do it too."

"You already had a turn."

The carriage attendants, who had been observing our conversation, approached us.

"Um... that medium-sized monster just now? And there were five of them..."

"Instant defeat..."

"Lottery tickets..."

"Sigh... it's turning out just as bad as I expected."

"Ha ha, everyone's improving their skills; that's a good thing."

Hearing the comments from the carriage attendants, everyone sighed a bit resignedly.

"Do they always react this way?"

"It can't be helped. We've gotten used to it. We've received this kind of reaction even during joint training, so we're used to it by now."

"We'll probably continue to get reactions like this."

"That's what we want."

Is this a positive trend? Everyone seems to be starting to accept this situation.

"Sorry for making you wait, but we'd like to continue."

"Yes, of course!"

Following Oug's instructions, everyone boarded the carriages and moved forward.

Inside the carriage, Grandma asked me a question.

"Shin, how strong are the members of the research club? Is that girl exceptionally strong?"

"No, I think everyone else can do the same things."

"Yes, we can."

"I can do it too."

"I can manage something like that."

"Something like that... You've been doing quite remarkable things, and you're saying 'something like that...'"

"Ho ho, our senses have become quite numb."

"Not in a good way! Hah... they really are a special forces unit, aren't they?"

Grandma let out a tired sigh.

"I've modified someone else's children so much... What should I say?"

Everyone chuckled while listening to Grandma's muttering.

Modification... do they use it on people too?orm edge cases
