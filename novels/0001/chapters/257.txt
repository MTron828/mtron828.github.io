A few days after the Ellie assault incident, Ogre finally showed up at the Ultimate Magicians' office.

"Hey, long time no see. Is the case resolved?" I asked.

Ogre, looking a bit tired, nodded as he led me to a corner of the room. "Yeah, we've arrested the perpetrator and the mastermind."

"Oh, that's great! Even though it's only been a few days since then," I said. It's surprising they already caught the culprits.

However, it was the attempted assassination of the Crown Princess, after all. They must have deployed a significant number of personnel for the investigation, so an early resolution makes sense.

"Still, you look quite tired. If they've caught the criminals, shouldn't you be relieved?" I asked.

Ogre shook his head slowly. "It's not that simple."

"What do you mean?" I inquired. Perhaps they're struggling with how to handle the culprits?

Considering they attempted to assassinate the Crown Princess, a death penalty seems like the only option, right?

That's what I thought, but it seemed there was more to the story. Ogre grabbed my shoulder and guided me towards a corner of the office.

"I mentioned that we caught the perpetrator and mastermind, right?"

"Yeah. Huh? Isn't that all of them?"

Not all of them? "Well, there's an intermediary between the mastermind and the perpetrator, and we can't track down their whereabouts."

"What?" An intermediary? So, someone who selected the perpetrator on behalf of the mastermind.

"But why can't you catch the middleman when you've already apprehended both ends?" I asked.

I thought they would typically work their way from the perpetrator to the mastermind, but it seems it didn't go as smoothly.

"We managed to secure the intermediary's base, but they weren't there. While we could identify the mastermind and make an arrest from the evidence found at the location, the intermediary remains elusive," Ogre explained.

I see. Nevertheless, if the intermediary escaped, and they had evidence against the mastermind... "Did they intentionally leave it behind?"

"What do you mean?" Ogre asked in response to my muttered comment.

"Intentionally? What does that mean?"

Is this the kind of thing that should be investigated in advance?

Thinking that, Ogre shook his head.

"It's for a pregnant woman, not to mention the Crown Princess. They certainly conduct pre-employment screenings. But she frequently catches a cold, and not just one person."

"Multiple people? Wait, was there an outbreak of a cold or something?"

Isn't that dangerous in a place where a pregnant woman is present?

I thought that, but Ogre shook his head again.

"No maids or guards got sick. It always seemed to affect the food taster alone."

"...Does that mean..."

Could it be...

"There might have been poison in Ellie's food, a low-grade poison that causes symptoms similar to a cold."

"!!"

Even though it's a mild poison, it's a terrible thing for a pregnant woman. They say pregnant women shouldn't even consume nicotine from tobacco, let alone catechins from tea. Poison, even if it's not lethal...

"Oh, maybe... the things the Count had prepared..."

"That was poison that caused symptoms similar to a cold."

So, evidence of purchasing that poison has also emerged.

"I was investigating that as well, but it's about the food, right? It's already consumed, and there's no physical evidence left. I thought it would be difficult, but unexpected evidence surfaced from somewhere. He confessed to that matter too."

So, that Count Doville was planning Ellie's poisoning.

What a guy.

"He was frustrated. He said he had poisoned her many times, but Ellie's condition didn't change. He even asked if she had an immunity to poison."

"Immunity to poison... What's that..."

I've never heard of such a unique condition.

"This is also thanks to the magical tool that Shin received. I never dreamed that both the pendant's poison immunity and barrier would activate in a situation like this."

"Well, yeah..."

I didn't think that would happen either, as it was applied for a worst-case scenario.

"Anyway, with that, we were able to prove the long-standing concern... By the way, do you know who the culprit is who poisoned the food?"

"No... but there is one person who is highly suspicious. There's a person who resigned just before the Ellie assault incident. They quit their job suddenly without any prior notice. It seems they only mentioned personal reasons when asked for a reason."

"Hey, that's really suspicious."

That's why we're currently conducting a thorough search," Ogre replied.

"...Do you think they'll be found?"

While considering a possibility, I asked Ogre, who also sighed.

"I wonder... considering they failed the assassination several times, there's a chance they've already been eliminated."

"Yeah..."

A person who had access to the Crown Princess's food would undoubtedly have been employed for a considerable period.

I can't imagine hiring someone recently for such a role.

It would require years of dedicated service to earn such trust.

"...Why would they do something like this?"

I couldn't help but mutter that, and Ogre furrowed his brows.

"Probably for money. The magician who was the perpetrator was being coerced with their family held hostage, but the resigned servant had already lost their parents and was living alone. They didn't even have a lover."

"They ruined their life for a small amount of money..."

"They might have ruined their life, indeed."

If that's the case, it's such a sad situation.

The money gained from such actions wouldn't be enough to live a carefree life, and if they used it, they would likely be overwhelmed by guilt each time.

They must have been in a desperate situation.

"Even so, did they manage to find evidence to that extent? It looks like the intermediary person is undoubtedly the mastermind."

"Yeah, it seems that way. Leaving behind that much evidence, it's hard to believe they weren't trying to frame Count Doville for everything."

"So, do you know anything about this intermediary person?"

"We know that they were a foreign merchant, but..."

Ogre's words, unusually, were hesitant.

"Is there some issue?"

"I asked Count Doville about the merchant's nationality. He said it was a Sweed merchant."

"Really?"

"But..."

Ogre said, furrowing his brow.

"The thing is, that intermediary person was apparently a merchant. When I interviewed people who had contact with them, they all mentioned different birthplaces for the merchant, like Kurt or Caran."

"Wow, that's really suspicious."

"That's right. So, we can't locate the whereabouts of that merchant..."

"I see..."

Is the person deliberately giving different places of origin to throw people off?

This is definitely premeditated.

"Is the only birthplace that the merchant mentioned Sweed, Kurt, and Caran? What about Els?"

Els is a merchant's country, after all.

Although it's not like hiding a tree in a forest, blending in with one of the many merchants would make it more difficult to track them down, right?

"No, Els is out of the question. Their accent is distinct. It's not something you can easily mimic, and trying to imitate it would make it sound strange."

Ah, I see. It's like someone from a region other than Kansai trying to speak Kansai dialect.

"What about East?"

"Probably not. It's a religious country that values simplicity and poverty. It would be suspicious for them to seek wealth and actively search for markets abroad."

Then, how about Dam?

"Dam is..."

When I asked, Ogre pondered for a moment.

"Wait, could it be Dam?"

After a moment of thought, Ogre muttered with a surprised expression.

"...It might be worth investigating."

"Yeah, you're right. Sorry for the trouble, Shin."

With that, Ogre briefly scanned the inside of the office, opened the gate, and left.

He still doesn't seem very settled.

Looking around the area where the gate had disappeared, I went to see everyone, and Catherine and Alma were looking at me with warm eyes again.

"W-What is it?"

I couldn't help but ask because those looks were making me uneasy. Catherine smiled.

"Oh, it's nothing, really."

"...Is that so?"

"Yes. More importantly, you had such a serious expression. Is something going on?"

I feel like they might get the wrong idea, and the previous conversation isn't something I should share with Catherine and the others.

"Well... it's a bit of a confidential matter, so I can't share it, and it's best not to know."

I said that, and Catherine nodded casually.

"I see. Then, we won't ask any further."

Come to think of it, Catherine is a Sweed elite, right?

She must have had the opportunity to deal with the country's classified information before, and she was pretty easygoing about dropping the subject.

Alma said she used to be a government clerk, so she probably didn't have many opportunities to deal with such matters.

In fact, she still seems a bit curious about the conversation.

But since Catherine backed down, maybe it's best not to ask further.

Ian, Henri, and Cartas are gathered, having a discussion among themselves.

Shaolin appears to be reviewing documents related to the preparation of the language school, nodding in understanding.

It's the usual scene in the office after work.

Although it's busy right now, will we be able to return to our usual daily routine once Ogre returns... I wonder?

While looking around the office, I pondered these thoughts. ideas
