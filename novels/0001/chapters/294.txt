"Welcome, Allen and Cresta."

On a certain holiday, Allen and Cresta, who were Silver's friends, came to visit again.

Apparently, they had brought them along because they couldn't thank Via-chan for playing with them. Despite being a princess, Via-chan had grown up to be a child who could express gratitude properly, which impressed me.

So, the first thing we did when they came to our place was a thank-you from the four toddlers.

"Thank you for playing with us!!"

The sight of four toddlers lined up, saying their thanks, was very cute, and the mothers watching the scene were wriggling with excitement.

... What am I doing?

"No, it's an honor for Her Highness the Princess to have enjoyed herself."

"We are honored as well."

In contrast, Allen and Cresta were composed. Well, since Allen and Cresta are close in age to Sharl and the others, they probably don't get flustered by the actions of toddlers. Still, the way they gracefully accepted thanks with a smile was very impressive.

Come to think of it, the Walford family is commoners, so they haven't received such education from Silver, but is that necessary?

As I pondered Silver's educational policy, the toddlers raised their voices again in unison.

"Please play with us today too!"

The moment they said that, the faces of the two who had been smiling just a moment ago twisted in shock.

Dealing with four toddlers can be tough.

I understand the expression they had.

Honestly, I thought it was a bit unfair, but I was grateful that they would be able to handle these energetic toddlers. As I was about to ask for their help, Silver spoke to the toddlers first.

"I'm sorry. Today, Cresta-san wants to talk with the mothers."

"Eh!?"

Allen and Cresta exclaimed in unison, but their expressions were completely opposite.

Allen looked despairing, while Cresta had a delighted expression.

Still, does Cresta want to hear Sicily's story?

"Oh, that's fine. What kind of story would you like to hear?"

"Is it okay!?"

There, Olivia extended a helping hand.

Olivia approached the pale Cresta and gently stroked his head.

"It's okay, Cresta-chan. Ellie's just a little upset that she might not be able to join the love conversation."

Olivia said with a smile.

As a result, Cresta's face turned even paler.

"Huh?"

Olivia tried to reassure Cresta, but he kept getting paler. I tilted my head along with Olivia. Why?

"Um, well..."

Cresta, with a still pale face, spoke to Olivia.

"Yes?"

"Olivia-sama! Is it really okay to say such things to Her Highness? It might be considered disrespectful or...?"

"Eh?"

Disrespect? Both Olivia and I were left dumbfounded.

However, Ellie nodded in understanding.

"It's not a problem. How many years do you think I've been with these people? It's not a disrespectful relationship anymore, saying things like that."

"Ellie-san, we don't have any other friends besides them."

"Olivia, you..."

Queen Crown Princess Ellie and the commoner Olivia exchanged playful banter.

Cresta watched this scene in disbelief for a while, but gradually, his complexion returned to normal.

"See, Cresta-chan. So, could you include us too? Since Ellie and I have been watching you both closely for so long, we might be able to answer your questions?"

As Olivia said this, she whispered something to Cresta.

"You want to get closer to Allen-kun, don't you?"

When Olivia said this, Cresta blushed intensely, a stark contrast to his earlier paleness.

"W-Why would you say that!"

Olivia's words seemed to have hit the mark. Cresta was clearly flustered.

They were stumbling over each other.

"Hehe, our husbands have been childhood friends, you know? We're experts in childhood friend romances, in a way."

Saying this, Olivia proudly puffed her chest.

"W-Wait, Olivia. Does that mean we have to talk about our relationship too?"

It seems that Ellie, who initially appeared to only meddle in our conversation with Sicily, was now flustered, but Olivia just smiled.

"Why not, Ellie? Let's support their young love."

Olivia said that, and Ellie glanced briefly in the direction where Silver and Allen were. They were already swarmed by children.

Upon seeing that, Ellie sighed and said, "I see. Perhaps I can hear some useful stories for myself."

As Ellie spoke, Cresta nodded in agreement.

"Princess Octavia, you really love Silver, don't you?"

"That's right. She's quite the discerning daughter of mine."

Ellie said this, placing her hand on her large pregnant belly, and Olivia, who was also in the mid-stage of pregnancy, took a seat. Cresta followed suit.

"Now, shall we start with the story of Shin-san and Sicily-san?"

Ellie grinned and began speaking, but there was one person who didn't take a seat.

"I don't know much about their romantic situation, so I'll take care of the children."

The only one who didn't sit down, Chris-nee-chan, said this and quickly left the scene.

"Oh, she ran away again."

Ellie said this, looking disappointed. Judging from the flow of the conversation earlier, it seemed that after our story, it would naturally transition to Ellie and Olivia's story. If that happened, then it would also lead to Chris-nee-chan and Sieg-nii-chan, the other couple, having to share their story. She must have sensed that in advance.

"Well, it's fine. So, Cresta-san, what would you like to hear?"

Prompted by Ellie, who had now taken on the role of a host, Cresta opened the book he had with him and started flipping through the pages until he stopped at a certain page.

"Um, well, first, I'd like to hear about the scene where you two first met."

"Huh? From there!?"

"Oh."

While I was taken aback and asked for clarification, Sicily seemed somewhat interested. I knew that girls liked talking about love, but could it be that this conversation would go on endlessly from our first meeting until now?

My intuition proved correct, and Cresta started asking questions like, "In this scene," "At that time," and Sicily would provide behind-the-scenes information like, "At that time...," "That part is fictional. In reality...".

Ellie and Olivia added some supplementary information, and Cresta's eyes were sparkling with excitement.

Occasionally, I was also asked questions, so I couldn't just brush it off. I found myself being dragged into these girls' love talk.

Glancing at Silver and the others, I noticed that the children were no longer in the living room but had gone out to the garden. Chris-nee-chan, a current active knight who had returned to her duties as a Royal Guard, was keeping the children entertained. The children playfully challenged her and burst into laughter each time they were rolled over. Silver and Allen were also participating, with Silver sometimes taking it seriously and Allen looking a bit frustrated as he repeatedly challenged Chris-nee-chan.

They seemed to be having a great time over there.

As I continued to escape into this alternate reality, Cresta-san asked me, "Shin-sama, what were you thinking at that time?" referring to the explanations about my romantic experiences as written in the book. It felt like a torturous hell, pulling me back into the conversation.

"Uh, well... this might be a bit exaggerated..."

"Oh, really?"

"Yes, it is. At that time, Walford-kun was..."

"Eh? Is that so?"

Cresta-san looked disappointed with my response, Olivia added some details, and Ellie, who was hearing about it for the first time, asked for more information.

Sicily and I couldn't help but wear wry smiles since this conversation had started.

Sigh... I wish I could join Silver and the others and have some fun. a story
