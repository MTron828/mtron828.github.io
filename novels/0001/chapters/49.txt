Thanks to the declaration issued throughout the Swede Kingdom of Aug, the capital of the Swede Kingdom resounded with great cheers.

Along with the team name's chorus...

I despaired not only for Arlsheid but also for the fact that the team name had become known in the Swede Kingdom.

"It's not the time to be down, Shin."

"Whose fault is it? Whose!"

"Don't say things like Lord Merida. More importantly, have you noticed?"

"Notice what... that Strom wasn't there?"

"And that we couldn't see the appearance of the monsters. In other words..."

"We let almost half of them escape, and there's still more to come..."

"That's right."

Certainly, the voice that ordered the retreat earlier was not Strom's voice. In other words, this attack was the result of the independent actions of those who had become demons under Strom.

Was Strom given full authority to attack the Swede Kingdom, or...

"!! Aug! Let's return to Arlsheid for now!"

"I see! A diversion, is it!?"

"It's too straightforward! The possibility is high!"

"Understood! Let's go back!"

Attack the Swede Kingdom with only the demons and infiltrate Arlsheid in the meantime!

Damn! I didn't consider that possibility!

Because I was in such a hurry, I returned to the Arlsheid Kingdom capital through the gate with Aug alone.

Please be safe!

"Hey? Your Highness, what happened to Mr. Wolford?"

"Oh, that? Where are the demons?"

"Huh!? Did the demons attack here!?"

"Well, no... Did the demons not come this way?"

"Yeah, there hasn't been anything since Your Highness and the others left..."

...Huh? I thought for sure that the attack was a diversion, and the real target was here...

"More importantly, how did things go in the Swede Kingdom?"

"...Don't worry. There was some damage, but we repelled the demons."

"Wow!"

I connected the gate to the usual guard post, but the guard there said there was no demon attack.

And they were cheering for the report that the demons that appeared in the Swede Kingdom had been repelled.

"As expected! The Ultimate Magicians led by Mr. Wolford! I'll report to His Majesty right away!"

"So...?"

The soldiers who had spoken up at that point quickly prostrated themselves on the spot.

Well, that was fast!

"We... we deeply apologize!! We have shown great disrespect towards the heroes who saved our nation from its dire straits!"

"Please! Please, just spare our lives!"

Finally, the misunderstanding was cleared up, but... the soldiers' lives? Also, they said something that caught my attention.

"Don't worry, you didn't know our faces, and it's natural to be cautious. Rather, even if you thought we might be demons, you didn't run away and tried to protect this place. That's a commendable act. Stand tall."

"Haha, thank you for your kind words!"

Oh, even though they are soldiers from another country, they've been won over. The soldiers are looking at Aug with teary eyes.

"So, can we pass?"

"Yes, please, go ahead!"

"Hey, someone, guide us to where Lady Sisley is!"

He said it again.

Lady Sisley?

I have a bad feeling about this...

Led by the guiding soldier, we arrived at a hall-like place where the injured were being taken care of.

And when we entered the hall...

"Please, Lady Sisley! Help this child's injuries!"

"Please, save my husband, Saint Lady!"

"Oh, my injuries too..."

"Weren't you just treated a little while ago?"

"Oh, well, we'll examine everyone in order!"

There was a commotion, with Sisley at the center.

Lady Sisley? Saint Lady?

What's all this fuss about?

"What's going on?"

"Yes, after Lady Sisley arrived at this facility, she has been healing severely injured patients one after another, saving many lives! She's truly a figure deserving to be called a Saint Lady!"

...Looks like something big is happening.

For now, I don't see any severely injured patients, so let's take Sisley with us.

"Sisley!"

"Huh? Oh, Shin!"

Sisley, who had been perplexed by the people crowding around her until then, smiled happily when I called out to her.

"Hey, you just called Lady Sisley by her first name?"

"What did you say!? Who is it? Who's the one calling our Lady Sisley by her first name?"

"Hey, isn't that the guy?"

Oh, come on! I'm getting weird glances!

As I was concerned about the commotion around us, Sisley jumped into my arms.

"Shin! Are you okay? Did you get hurt?"

It's the usual routine. She's touching my body, asking if I got hurt.

"I'm fine. I won't get hurt by those demons, even if they come in a group."

"I know, but... I still worry."

She said that and hugged me tightly.

"Oh, you! What an envious... no, an unacceptable thing to do!"

"Right! What right do you have to hug our Saint Lady?"

"Let go of this guy right now!"

"Are you gonna stop us?"

The increasingly irritated shouts from the jealous men were suddenly cut short by a loud voice from one of the soldiers.

"Hey, soldier... but!"

"But nothing! This person is Shin Wolford-sama, the hero who defeated the demons and saved us from the demons. What insolence are you speaking!"

Maybe because of what happened earlier, the soldier was desperately defending me.

"A hero who defeated demons!?"

"Is this... really the guy?"

"Could it be a mistake?"

Oh, well... Can I lose my temper soon...?

"Please don't speak of my husband in that way!"

Sisley got angry before I could lose my temper.

Wait, husband...?

"Is, husband...?"

"I, it's not exactly... my husband yet... but! He's my official fianc√©! Don't speak of him like that!"

With those words from Sisley, almost all the men in the hall looked despairing.

"Wow! How lovely! A couple of a hero and a saint!"

"Wolford, right?"

"Yes, I've heard of it! The great hero Merlin Wolford-sama has a grandson who appeared in the Arlsheid Kingdom and defeated the demons!"

"Oh... how romantic it is... a couple of a hero's grandson and a saint!"

"It's like a story!"

Instead, the women started making a commotion.

"Um... I'd like to report to the royal palace soon..."

"Shin, is it okay before that...?"

Sisley asked me with a slightly dark expression.

"What's wrong, Sisley?"

"Please come with me..."

Following Sisley's lead, we arrived at a place where...

"I... I couldn't do anything for him..."

A man with significant injuries, struggling to breathe, lay on a bed.

Beside him, a woman who appeared to be his wife or girlfriend was by his side.

When the woman saw Sisley, she clung to her.

"Lady Sisley, please! Please save my husband... I'll do anything, so please..."

Her voice grew faint and almost inaudible towards the end, as she implored Sisley.

"I'm sorry... There's nothing more I can do..."

"No... no..."

"Shin, could you take a look?"

"Yes."

I had been examining the man's condition even before Sisley asked for my help. It seemed that the bleeding had stopped thanks to a healing spell that Sisley had likely cast, but it looked like his internal organs were severely damaged. It's a wonder he's still alive.

"Sisley, you did a great job."

"I couldn't do anything..."

"Even so, because of your healing magic, this man is still alive. Without it... he would have died long ago."

The man's wife collapsed in tears upon hearing those words.

I think even with medical technology from my previous life, this situation would be hopeless.

"I'll use healing magic."

Yes, in this world, there is magic.

I used ultrasound-based scanning magic to examine the man's body.

"His injuries are quite severe... how is he still alive?"

"He was brought here and we've been continuously trying to heal him, but there hasn't been much improvement... He tried to take off his combat uniform to receive treatment, but the others stopped him."

"...I should have enchanted the cloak with healing magic as well..."

I see... he couldn't take off his upper garments like he could with the uniform. If a girl suddenly started undressing, of course they would stop her.

"Don't worry, ma'am. Thanks to Sisley's healing magic, your husband is still alive. With this..."

I temporarily severed the nerve transmissions from his neck down, creating an anesthesia-like effect. I didn't actually know the principles of anesthesia, but I figured if the pain didn't reach his brain, it would work the same way.

It's a superhuman feat that can only be accomplished with magic.

Once the anesthesia was applied to the man, I began the repair of his damaged internal organs. Using cells from the surrounding tissue, I cultivated and multiplied cells identical to those of the damaged organs, gradually regenerating the internal organs. I started by repairing the blood vessels closest to the life-critical heart, followed by the organ repair, and finally the healing of the skin with external injuries. I also restored the severed nerve transmissions.

After completing the healing, I observed the man who had received the treatment.

"Yeah, his breathing has stabilized. He's all right now!"

I was about to reassure him when I was tackled by the man's wife.

"Thank you very much..."

She hugged me tightly and expressed her gratitude.

Being thanked for saving a life was much more satisfying than being thanked for defeating the demons.

After the wife left and went to her husband, Sisley hugged me next.

"Thank you for saving him... Thank you so much..."

"Sisley."

"Yes."

"His recovery is all thanks to you, Sisley."

"That's not true... I couldn't do anything..."

Sisley began sobbing, burying her face in my chest.

Then...

"That's not true!"

"Madam?"

The healed man's wife contradicted Sisley's words.

"You said the same thing earlier! If it weren't for Lady Sisley's healing magic, my husband would have died long ago! He undoubtedly owes his life to Lady Sisley!"

"Madam..."

In the end, it was I who completed the healing, but Sisley undeniably kept him alive until then. The wife understood that.

"Thank you... Thank you, Lady Sisley. I will never forget this kindness."

Sisley, who had moved away from me, responded with tears in her eyes.

"No... I just did what was expected... I'm glad he's all right."

"Thank you, Lady Sisley, and also..."

The wife looked in my direction.

"This person is Shin, Shin Wolford. He's my mentor in healing magic, a hero in demon extermination, and..."

Sisley looked at me, wiped her tears, and smiled.

"My... future husband."

"My, my... So, my husband was saved by the hero and the saint. It'll be a lifelong boast."

The husband, relieved that he was saved, had lightened up enough to make some jokes.

"Wife, although your husband's life has been preserved, I had to collect a lot of cells from the surrounding tissue during the healing process. He must have lost a significant amount of strength, so make sure to feed him nutritious food, and once he's settled, encourage him to do some exercise to regain his strength."

"Yes! Thank you!"

"Well then, we must report to the royal castle soon."

"Yes! Thank you, Lady Sisley, Lord Shin."

Leaving the two behind, we exited the room.

There, a crowd of residents had gathered, though I wasn't sure when they had arrived.

"Amazing... Lady Sisley couldn't help him, but she saved the patient..."

"No way... What's going on here..."

"They're stronger than the demon slayers, and they can use more potent healing magic than Lady Sisley... And, on top of that, to marry Lady Sisley...?"

"Why!? Why is this world so unfair!"

The resentment of the men was palpable!

"Ha... Heroes are truly incredible..."

"To become the wife of a hero, one needs to be as outstanding as Lady Sisley."

"They're a perfect match... Someone, write a story about the two of them!"

"Please refrain from that!"

Uh-oh! It seemed like things were spiraling out of control. If I didn't intervene now, it would be a disaster!

"Hey, Shin, it's time to go. We can't keep King Sui waiting forever."

"Wait, just a moment! I can't let this story spread!"

"It's no use. We've already spent quite a bit of time. Let's go."

"Wait! Wait!"

I was pulled away from the scene by Tony and Julius, who held me on either side, and dragged away.

No, this story must not progress any further!

"Heh, don't worry, Shin."

"O-Ort..."

Was Ort going to stop it somehow?

"The story has already started in Earlshide. It seems like they're planning to publish it once they've gathered a few more episodes."

Is it too late now?

"That's impossible! A story can't just become a book that easily!"

"It might be best to give up, Shin. My family is also eagerly awaiting the publication of the book."

"Yeah, mine too."

"Same here."

"And my family too, they've been looking forward to it."

"Sorry, Waldford-kun, we're in it too!"

"If it's about Waldford-kun's story, our research club's families are all looking forward to it, I think."

What is this?! Not only did we embarrass ourselves with the team name, but now there's a story too!

"I can't show my face in public anymore..."

"I-It's okay! Everyone looks at Shin-kun in a favorable light!"

"Does this mean that our story also reveals your relationship with Sisley to the public?"

"Eep! W-Well, I..."

Sisley turned beet red.

"Just be like Lord Merlin and Lady Merida and accept it. People want to hear the hero's story. We can't stop it."

"For real..."

"Don't worry, I'll take responsibility and provide accurate information."

"I thought you'd say that!!"

This guy! He's been with me ever since I came to the capital, so I knew he would be the information provider for sure!

Is there no way to stop it somehow?

"The draft for the first volume is mostly done already, so if something else happens, we can publish it... Maybe this incident can be part of it?"

"There's nothing more to be done!"

"Even Shin can't do anything about it."

"This is all your fault!"

Seriously! This guy is...

"Oops, that's enough noise. We've arrived at the royal castle."

"Uh, ugh!"

"I'm August von Earlshide, Crown Prince of the Earlshide Kingdom. I have a report for King Sui. May I have an audience?"

"Of course! We've been waiting for you, Your Highness August! His Majesty is waiting for you; please come this way."

"Well, let's go, Shin."

"R-Remember this..."

"Sounds like something a villain would say."

Ogg, who was laughing happily, was so annoying!

It seems that listening to the voices of the citizens is a duty of the royal family... But we really don't need to prioritize it like this!
