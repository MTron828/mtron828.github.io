A few months after the attempted assassination incident of Ellie.

In the end, they couldn't arrest the intermediary, but they had succeeded in preventing the infiltration of troublemakers from overseas by tightening immigration inspections.

It was reported that many individuals, unaware of the stricter immigration inspections, were getting arrested at the border while trying to bring illegal items into the country.

The tightening of immigration inspections apparently contributed to the improvement of domestic security, leading to a decrease in the crime rate.

Og had mentioned that it was an unexpected byproduct.

Despite the occurrence of a significant event, the overall security in the country improved, and there was no particularly dangerous situation when walking in the city.

So, on one holiday in the now-stable season of autumn, Sicily and the increasingly mischievous Silver were taken for a walk.

"Let's go for a walk! Let's go for a walk!"

With Sicily and me holding hands, Silver walked happily.

Sicily, having passed the stable period, regained the ability to use magic and returned to active duty.

Natasha, who accompanied us as a guard, always seemed worried.

Even now, she followed us, looking anxious.

"Oh, Silver-sama! To be waved at by the saint like that..."

"Huh?"

"Well, it's okay, Natasha-san."

"But, still..."

Natasha, a bishop of the Church of the Creator and a pope, admired Ekaterina, who had recognized Sicily as a saint, in the same way.

But really, isn't this a bit too much admiration?

I wasn't the only one who thought so.

"Come on, Natasha, cut it out. Being too overprotective will stress Sicily out."

Even though Sicily could use magic now, Miranda, who inexplicably remained as a guard, criticized Natasha.

Well... Miranda is Miranda, and she tends to be too rough around the edges...

"Hah!? I just want to protect the saint with all my heart!"

"That's fine, but your approach is too overbearing!"

"What did you say!?"

These two have become quite close during their time as guards together.

Lately, whenever they open their mouths, it's always an argument...

Honestly, I can't help but feel that this exchange is causing stress for Sicily.

In reality, Sicily is also smiling wryly.

Just as I was thinking about stopping the two soon...

"Stop fighting, you two!"

Silver let go of Sicily and me, turned around, and scolded the two.

"Eh, ah, no, Silver-sama, it's not like that!"

"Yeah, that's right. We're not fighting, Silver."

Facing Natasha and Miranda, who were crouching down in a panic, trying to explain that they weren't fighting, Silver puffed out his cheeks.

"Muu!"

However, Silver, who had heard the previous exchange, didn't trust their words and continued to glare at them.

"Ugh..."

Being stared at with such innocent eyes by the pure-hearted child, the two became visibly flustered and awkwardly looked at each other.

"Um, sorry. I got too worked up."

"No... I also said too much. Sorry."

Apologizing to each other, they looked at Silver, who had been watching them, tilting his head.

"Friends?"

Asked by Silver, the two suddenly linked arms.

"Yes!"

"We're good friends!"

They showed smiles to Silver, so much so that you wouldn't think they had just been arguing.

Seeing that, Silver smiled brightly.

"Great!"

Oh, what is this? It's ridiculously cute!

"Wow... Silver is so cute!"

It seemed Sicily felt the same way as me. She turned from her earlier wry smile to a melting smile directed at Silver.

I patted Silver's head, praising him for mediating between the two.

You have to praise when someone does something good.

"Silver, you're amazing. You made the big sisters reconcile."

As I said that, Silver, who had been tickled by the head-patting, raised his face and smiled, saying, "Yeah!"

"Sigh... Silver is too cute; it hurts."

"I understand."

"Huh?"

To my murmur, Sicily immediately agreed.

Silver, on the other hand, seemed clueless about the meaning.

"Such doting parents..."

Watching us like that, Miranda made such a comment.

"There's no such thing as doting parents, right?"

"That's right, Miranda. It's a fact that Silver is cute. I'm just stating the truth, not being overly doting."

"Your statement already sounds like doting, though..."

Hmm, why is Miranda so exasperated?

Well, it's a fact that Silver is a good and cute kid.

"Certainly, it's a fact that Silver-sama is a good and cute child, but... is it because of that? When a mother is pregnant, the older child misunderstands and thinks that the parent's affection is being taken away by the unborn child, so Silver-sama is being attended to prevent that?"

"Eh?"

"Oh, it's just a thought. Never mind."

Come to think of it, I had a conversation with Sicily about being careful not to neglect Silver while focusing on the unborn child.

I completely forgot about that.

"Well... as long as Silver-sama feels your affection, there's no problem."

Having received approval from Natasha as well, it seems there's no issue.

"Now, instead of lingering here, let's go soon."

"Yes, that's right. Silver's friends must be waiting at the park."

"Yeah! Friends! Let's go!"

Looking forward to playing with friends at the park, Silver once again took our hands and began to pull us along energetically.

Oh, he's gotten quite strong!

"Silver, if you rush like that, you'll get tired by the time we reach the park, and then you won't be able to play... huh?"

"Huh?"

While Sicily was gently trying to calm Silver, who was eagerly pulling us along, something seemed to catch her attention, and she stopped in her tracks, cutting off her words.

"Mama?"

"Sicily, what's wrong?"

"Oh, um..."

Sicily, who had found something, pointed to a specific spot.

Her hand was trembling slightly.

I looked where she was pointing, my guard up to the max, wondering if something had happened to make Sicily tremble.

And then... what I saw there left me in shock.

"What... what is this?"

In the face of such a situation, my voice was hoarse.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

Words failed me.

What is this?

What am I... witnessing?

In the face of an unbelievable scene, both Sicily and I were left speechless.

Neither of us could move.

Breaking the silence and stiffness, a voice came from behind.

"Aaaah!! Mariaaa!!?"

Miranda suddenly screamed and rushed forward.

"Huh? Ge! Miranda!? Shin and Sicily too!"

Seeing Miranda running toward them with a loud voice, the person who was there... our friend and Sicily's childhood friend Maria made a displeased face.

"Hey! What the hell is going on!!"

Grabbing Maria's collar, who looked so displeased, Miranda pointed to a certain point.

Yes, where she was pointing...

"Huh? Isn't that Mr. Shin? What a coincidence."

Caltus, the secretary of the Ultimate Magicians, was there.

Finally, I began to accept reality.

The two were at the open terrace of a café.

What we saw was the sight of the two of them enjoying tea together.

Huh? Since when?

Were the two in such a relationship?

I completely didn't notice!

"Maria! You! When did you... and a boyfriend?"

At Miranda's words, Maria hurriedly stood up.

"I-I said! It's not like that! Besides, the reason I'm with Mr. Caltus is because of you guys!"

"Huh!? Don't say things that make no sense!"

What? It's our fault that she's with Mr. Caltus?

We don't remember playing cupid for them!

Then, Maria gave us a sharp look.

"Sicily is pregnant, and Miranda has been with her as her guard all this time. There's no one else to go out with!"

Oh, come to think of it, these three have been close since their student days.

But...?

"If that's the case, invite someone else. Why Mr. Caltus?"

When I said that, Maria made a displeased face.

"Olivia is pregnant like Sicily, and on holidays, she's usually with Mark. Yuri is always with her boyfriend, Lin goes to the Magic Academy whenever she has free time, and Alice seems to have some business."

And then, Maria seems to have no plans...

"Wh-what about Catalina-san or Alma-san...?"

"Those two seem close, and it's hard to intrude... Shaolin-san seems busy too."

Ah, I see.

I've heard that Catalina is happy to be friends with her admired teacher, and on holidays, they often go out together.

Alma, too, seemed happy to have a friend to confide in for the first time.

"So, the only one left was Mr. Caltus? Why exclude Ian and Henri?"

"Ian is hot and sweaty with muscles, and Henri is a pervert."

Come to think of it, Ian was quite forward from the first meeting... He doesn't say such things these days, so I forgot.

"So, using process of elimination, Mr. Caltus was the only one left to invite on holidays."

"Don't call it 'process of elimination'; it sounds lonely, Maria-san."

"Ah, sorry, Mr. Caltus. Well, if I invited you, I wouldn't feel uncomfortable, and I usually feel like dying when I'm alone on holidays. Since Mr. Caltus said he usually spends holidays alone too, I thought, why not go out together?"

"I see."

Oh well, I thought Maria had finally found her spring.

But well, for Maria, who had never shown any interest in men before, this is a significant step forward.

At the moment, they are still just colleagues from work, but if they continue to go out together on holidays like this, their relationship might progress.

At that moment, there was a sound like something being rubbed against.

Looking at the source of the sound, there was Miranda, gritting her teeth, with a face that looked like she was about to shed blood tears.

"Mi-Miranda? What's wro—"

"On holidays..."

"Huh?"

"Just being with a man on holidays makes me jealous! Dammit!"

Saying so, Miranda started to cry sniffily.

...Huh!?

Why is she crying!?

"W-wait, Miranda."

Maria also hurriedly approached and began to rub Miranda's back.

"Uu... Even Lady Chris is getting married, and Maria is getting along with her male friend... Why am I the only one..."

Oh no, Miranda is seriously crying.

Was it that frustrating for her?

"W-wait, that's not the case for me either. And besides, Miranda, I'm sure you'll find someone to spend holidays with someday."

"...Maria, you're being condescending."

"Hey! I told you it's not like that!"

Maria seems busy trying to calm down or scold Miranda.

Watching the two of them, Caltus-san somehow came over to my side.

"Shin-san, can I talk to you for a moment?"

"Yes? What is it?"

Caltus-san then began to speak in a hushed voice, making sure it couldn't be heard by the two.

"Maria-san is saying that, but what's the real situation?"

"What do you mean by the real situation?"

When I asked that, Caltus-san looked at Maria and further lowered his voice.

"Is Maria-san showing any interest?"

"!"

Th-this is...!

Could it be that Caltus-san is serious?

"Eh, could it be that you, Caltus-san, about Maria..."

I also whispered, and Caltus-san gave a wry smile.

"I think she's good, Maria-san. She's cute, serious about her work, and I wonder why she hasn't had a boyfriend until now."

"That's... well, it's like, bad luck with men, or rather, decent ones just don't come around..."

Maria herself doesn't dislike men.

She often boldly declares that she wants a boyfriend, and she often looks enviously at those of us who have partners.

However, the men who approach Maria often engage in quite ruthless pick-up lines.

When I explained that briefly to Caltus-san, he thought for a moment with a "hmm."

"In other words, it's counterproductive to rush things?"

"That's right. She wants a boyfriend, but she doesn't like it when someone is too forward."

After saying that, Caltus-san smiled.

"Well, I got to hear an interesting story."

"I-is that so?"

"Hey, what are you two guys whispering about?"

Just as we finished talking, Maria approached us.

"Oh, Shin, I asked about recommended spots in the capital of Arlsheid."

"Y-yeah!"

Since I couldn't tell Maria about the previous conversation, I went along with Caltus-san's story.

"Huh? Shin lives in the capital, but you're not that familiar with it, right?"

"Uh..."

Oops, I messed up right away.

"S-so, I apologized, saying that even if you asked, I wouldn't know."

"Well, that's unfortunate. I thought you might know interesting places from a guy's perspective. Anyway, sorry, Maria-san, could you continue guiding us?"

C-Caltus-san...!

I never expected that he would smoothly transition from that conversation to asking Maria for guidance!

Caltus-san is originally a very capable person at work, so he might be able to win Maria over naturally...

Well, it's fine. It might be a good thing for Maria.

...I feel sorry for Miranda, though.

"By the way, are you two taking a stroll with your child?"

"Ah, yes."

Caltus-san glanced at Silver, who was at our feet, and asked while patting his head.

Silver, who was looking at Caltus-san with a curious expression, seemed to have judged him as a good person by accepting the head-pat. He was happily accepting Caltus-san's hand with a smile.

"Oh, yes. We're taking a walk to the park to let Silver play."

"That's nice, a happy family gathering. I'm starting to want children myself."

As Caltus-san said that, Maria's face blushed a little.

...Has she already fallen for him considerably?

Anyway, it wouldn't be good to keep Silver waiting, so I invited the two of them and left the place.

Once the cafe was out of sight, Miranda let out a deep sigh.

"Ugh... Maria, you traitor."

"Haha..."

We could only give a wry smile at Miranda's uttered words.

They haven't officially become a couple yet, but Caltus-san seems serious, so it might be just a matter of time.

"Don't you have anyone like that in the Knight Order?"

I tried to lead Miranda's thoughts in that direction, but when she looked at my face, her expression was like she had just bitten into something bitter.

"...I'm still not seen as a woman by my peers."

"S-so, seniors or someone? I mean, Miranda is cute too, and seniors wouldn't see you that way, right?"

While I tried to join in with encouragement, the expression on Miranda's face was gloomy.

"Seniors... how should I put it? They treat me kindly, but I don't feel like they see me as the opposite sex."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean... I've seen them try to pick up other girls from our year, but it has never happened to me. Comparing the treatment I receive to the other girls in my class, it feels like I'm being treated like a younger sister or something..."

"Yeah..."

Seeing the clear difference in treatment between her and other girls in the same year must have been disheartening.

But why is Miranda the only one treated like a younger sister?

Curious about this, Natasha unexpectedly began to talk, and it seemed like she was going to provide an answer.

"Most likely, it's because of Miranda's background."

"Huh?"

Surprised by the unexpected statement, Miranda looked bewildered.

"Since I've been assigned to work together with Lady Cecily as her guard, I've taken the liberty to investigate various things. Since we're working together, it's essential to understand each other, don't you think?"

"That's true."

"In the process, I learned that Miranda has been active with Shin-sama and the others since her student days, and she has achieved outstanding abilities and merits as a student. She's even a disciple of Sword Saint Michel=Colling-sama."

"Wow, you researched that far?"

Impressive information-gathering skills.

"Lady Cecily told me."

...So, she just asked someone who knew.

"And, during the Demon Lord War, Miranda fought alongside Shin-sama and others against the Demon Lord Strom and emerged victorious."

"Oh, that was... I was just there; I didn't contribute much..."

In response to Natasha's revelation, Miranda spoke with embarrassment.

"That's not true. You really helped us out."

"Yeah, exactly. Don't be so modest, Miranda."

"Ah!"

Shin and Cecily, despite telling Miranda not to be modest, got an unexpected agreement from Silver.

Cute.

"Regardless of the degree of contribution, the fact remains that you were there. Moreover, you were the only knight present at that time. For the Order of the Knights, the fact that there was at least one knight present at that crucial moment is significant. As a result, the seniors see you as a person who helped maintain the honor of the Order of the Knights."

"I-is that so?"

"Yes. I asked the knights directly, so there's no mistake. As for your peers... perhaps envy?"

"Envy?"

Miranda tilted her head, expressing her confusion.

Seeing her reaction, Natasha widened her eyes in surprise.

"Do you really not understand? Before joining the Order of the Knights, you were already being looked at with such eyes by the seniors. And now, you're the Holy Maiden's guard? Even though you just joined the Order, getting such a significant assignment, it's only natural for them to be jealous!"

Hearing Natasha's words, Miranda widened her eyes this time.

"Huh? Wasn't I chosen because I was originally friends with Cecily?"

In response to Miranda's statement, Natasha now showed visible anger.

"What are you saying? You're the Holy Maiden's guard! You were chosen to protect the most important person in this world! It's impossible to be selected just because you're on good terms with her!"

"I-I see..."

In the face of Natasha's stern demeanor, Miranda involuntarily used honorific language.

...Actually, I had the same thought as Miranda, but let's keep that to myself.

Looking to the side, Cecily also had a surprised expression, so she must have had the same idea.

Miranda had been delighted that she was chosen to be Cecily's guard.

"Well, that's the situation. Miranda is seen by the senior members of the Order of the Knights as someone who helped maintain the Order's honor. It's inconceivable that they would make a move on such a person out of mere friendship, resulting in her being treated like a younger sister."

"Is that so..."

Miranda seemed uncertain about whether to be happy or lament the fact that she wasn't treated like a young woman.

But well, the seniors in the Order of the Knights don't see her with strange eyes. For now, she's treated like a sister, but who knows what will happen in the future? She shouldn't be too pessimistic.

"By the way, which senior did Natasha-san ask about? You seem to know quite a bit, but did you have the time for that?"

"I inquired with Lady Christina."

...Once again, the information source was incredibly close by.

"But Chris-nee-chan knows detailed information about the Order of the Knights, and she is well-informed about Miranda too."

She's an ideal partner for gathering information.

"In that case, you don't have to be so downhearted, okay?"

When Natasha concluded this, Miranda's expression changed from the earlier dejected look.

"Is that so... Thanks, Natasha."

"No problem at all."

But still, Natasha has a knack for uplifting people who are feeling down. Truly befitting her role as a professional clergy.

Normally, she's a bit of a klutz, so seeing her in such situations makes the gap even more noticeable.

Watching Natasha with such warm eyes, Miranda dropped a bomb.

"By the way, Natasha, what about yourself?"

Upon hearing those words, Natasha's face froze for a moment.

"Well, I am a shrine maiden..."

"Huh? Can shrine maidens get married?"

Miranda looked at Cecily as if seeking confirmation.

No! Look at Natasha, not Cecily!

Because she's getting all worked up!

Cecily also noticed Natasha's state and her face twisted. Notice it!

This feeling, deliver it to Miranda!

...But alas, those prayers did not reach Miranda.

"Hey, Natasha..."

"I have no plans for that!"

It was a cry from the soul.

"Yes, that's right! I've never had a lover before, and even now, for the sake of the country, I continue to slay demons day after day... They even gave me the nickname 'Beastly Shrine Maiden'! Do you think someone would want to be with me like that!?"

"Uh... I, I'm sorry... I didn't know..."

While Miranda desperately apologized, Natasha, once ignited, couldn't be stopped.

"Among my peers, there are even those who are already married and have children! Why don't I have anything!? Even I... even I, I say!!"

Natasha shouted while crouching down, covering her face with both hands.

I didn't know because she had never shown any signs of it before, but it seems Natasha also wanted a boyfriend...

Perhaps understanding Natasha's feelings all too well, Miranda wore a compassionate expression and gently patted Natasha's shoulder.

"Sorry, Natasha. I asked something insensitive without knowing."

"Miranda..."

"I'll do my best too, Natasha. Let's both give it our all, and someday we'll surely find wonderful partners."

"Miranda..."

The two then knelt down, embraced each other, and shared tears.

It was a very beautiful scene, but the exchange between them was quite unfortunate.

Observing the two, Silver approached with tiny steps, and then gently stroked their heads.

"Pitter-patter."

As Silver caressed their heads, the two suddenly looked at Silver.

"... If it's come to this."

"Even Silver-sama..."

Their eyes were in trouble.

On instinct, I quickly picked up Silver.

"What are you saying to a toddler!"

"That's right! Please consider the age difference!"

Well, Cecily-san, is that really an issue?

Trying to somehow calm down the two who seemed confused, we finally resumed our walk.

Sigh... we haven't even reached the park yet, and I'm already tired...
