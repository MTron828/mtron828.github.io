On the afternoon when Shin had gone out for a long-awaited request, a single carriage passed through the gates of the Wolford family.

The carriage was solidly constructed but lacked extravagant decorations, and it had no family crest or anything of the sort.

When the carriage arrived in front of the house's entrance, a young boy descended from it.

"Welcome back, Master Silvester," greeted Steve, the head butler of the Wolford family, bowing respectfully. The young boy was Silvester Wolford, the eldest son of the family's head, Shin Wolford.

The Wolford family had become one of the wealthiest families in Earlshide.

Using an overly ornate carriage could attract unnecessary attention and, more importantly, could reveal that it belonged to the Wolford family, which could lead to various problems. That's why they used a plain carriage.

However, its simplicity was only on the outside. The carriage itself was made by Shin, offering a comfortable interior and formidable defensive capabilities.

Shin himself was the chairman of an automobile company, but those cars were used only on roads connecting cities. Running them within the town was dangerous due to the lack of infrastructure.

So, a carriage was used for Silvester's transportation.

"I'm home, Steve. Where's my mom and Charlotte?"

"Yes, Milady, Miss Charlotte, and Master Max are all ready and waiting for Master Silvester's return."

"I see. Then I better change quickly."

"Very well."

Passing by Steve who bowed, Silvester entered his home.

That's when it happened.

"Onii-chan!"

Charlotte, who had just entered the house, spotted Silvester and rushed towards him.

"Whoa!"

Silvester managed to catch Charlotte, who had run at full speed and leaped at him, after a few awkward steps.

"Welcome home, Onii-chan!"

Silvester was on the verge of falling, nearly taking Charlotte down with him. He had intended to scold her for it, but when he saw his little sister hugging him with a beaming smile, his scolding thoughts withered away.

"I'm home, Charlotte. Were you a good girl?"

"Yes! Charlotte's a good girl!"

Charlotte spoke confidently, without a hint of hesitation, but was her recent behavior really that of a good girl? Silvester wondered, but in front of Charlotte's cheerful smile, he couldn't bring himself to point it out.

"I see."

Silvester simply said, then ruffled Charlotte's hair.

"Hehe."

Charlotte, enjoying the petting, closed her eyes with contentment and accepted Silvester's touch.

As he continued to pet Charlotte, a small figure emerged from the living room.

"Charlotte, wait for me," the voice said, and it was Max, the son of Mark and Olivia.

"Oh, Silba Oniichan, welcome back."

Upon seeing Silvester, Max headed straight for him and, just like Charlotte, hugged him.

"I'm home. Welcome, Max."

Unlike Charlotte, who clung tightly, Max was more considerate in his embrace. Silvester greeted Max and ruffled his head.

"Yeah! Hehe."

Max giggled as Silvester continued to pet him, clearly enjoying it and showing no intention of letting go.

Stuck between two toddlers and unable to move, Silvester pondered what to do when Cecily, their mother, appeared in the living room, chuckling.

"Oh my, Silvie, you're quite popular."

"Mom, I'm home."

"Welcome back. Come on, Charlotte, Max. If you keep hugging your big brother, he won't be able to get ready. You're going to Via's place to play together, right?"

Cecily's words prompted Charlotte and Max to hastily release Silvester and step back.

"Big brother, hurry and change!"

"That's right. We've been waiting for you, big brother."

"Well..."

Despite being the ones who wouldn't let go, they were the ones complaining. Silvester couldn't help but marvel at the irrationality typical of young children.

Not scolding his younger siblings in situations like this was one of the reasons Silvester was so beloved by Charlotte and Max, and it was also a contributing factor in their behavior.

"Come on, Silvie, we'll keep the little ones busy, so go change quickly."

"Yeah, got it."

Silvester said that and headed to his room to quickly change from his school uniform into casual clothing. He returned to the living room and said, "Sorry for the wait."

As Silvester appeared, Cecily took out a wireless communication device.

"Ah, Ellie-san? Silvie's back, so I'll be heading there now."

After a brief conversation, Cecily turned off the communication device and looked at the three of them.

"Well then, I'm going."

Saying that, Cecily deployed the gate magic.

Silvester watched in awe with admiration in his eyes. This gate magic was known to be beyond the reach of regular magic users. Only a handful of mages could use it.

Cecily, his mother, casually employed such advanced magic. What was even more remarkable was that his father was the one who developed and taught her this highly advanced magic.

For Silvester, who greatly admired his parents, it was a source of immense pride. The embodiment of that pride was the gate magic that had just unfolded before him.

Every time he saw the gate magic, Silvester couldn't help but be captivated by it.

While Silvester was lost in admiration, Charlotte and Max, who probably had no idea what was going on, had already passed through the gate.

Cecily noticed Silvester, who was staring at the gate with sparkling eyes, and, with a smile at his admiring expression, reached out to him.

"Come on, Silvie, let's go."

"Oh, right."

Silvester, realizing he had been standing still and gazing at the gate, felt a bit embarrassed and blushed slightly. He took Cecily's hand and walked through the gate.

On the other side of the gate, Charlotte, Max, and Princess Octavia were joyfully reuniting.

"Welcome, Charlotte, Max."

"Hi, Via-chan!"

"Hello."

Octavia, with a royal demeanor, calmly greeted them, while Charlotte hugged her and greeted her. Max, on the other hand, stood a little apart and greeted from there.

Octavia, welcoming her same-age childhood friend, immediately looked around and, upon spotting Silvester, broke into a bright smile and ran over.

Charlotte, who had been hugging Silvester, was pushed aside.

"Silba Oniisama! Welcome!"

"Yeah, thanks for having me, Via-chan. You seem to be doing well."

"Yes, Via is doing well!"

The calmness that Octavia displayed just moments ago, not typical of a three-year-old, vanished as she blushed and cheerfully greeted Silvester. It was clear from her behavior how Octavia felt about him.

"Welcome, Cecily-san. Silvie, Charlotte, Max, please make sure to play with Via."

While watching Octavia's behavior with a chuckle, Crown Prince Consort Elizabeth, who was in her mid-pregnancy, welcomed the visitors while greeting them.

Elizabeth was dressed in a loose yet elegant dress that suited her pregnancy. Her appearance was truly befitting of the title of a princess.

"Hello, Aunt Ellie. Nice to see you!"

"Auntie! Hello!"

"Ellie Auntie, hello."

But to the children, she was just their friends' mother. In other words, their aunt. Having received a threefold "aunt" attack, Elizabeth, while her cheeks twitched, couldn't bring herself to scold the children and returned the greeting, albeit with some damage.

"Well, hello. It seems everyone is energetic today."

"Yes!"

"Yeah."

"Hello."

Charlotte and Max replied cheerfully to Elizabeth's words, while Silvester responded calmly.

Octavia, who had been gazing dreamily at Silvester, suddenly snapped out of it and rushed to Cecily.

"Greetings, Aunt Cecily."

Octavia gently lifted the edge of her dress and curtsied, offering her greetings to Cecily.

Despite her young age, Octavia's actions were reminiscent of a young lady, which made Cecily unintentionally relax her expression. However, she was originally a noble girl, even if her status had been lowered to that of a commoner since marrying Shin. Wanting to return the proper greeting, Cecily also curtsied.

"Good day, Princess Octavia. I'm glad to see you in good spirits."

With a smile, Cecily greeted Octavia, but for some reason, Octavia pouted unhappily.

"No, Aunt Cecily! Since Via is going to be Silba Oniisama's bride in the future, please call Via by her name!"

It seemed that addressing her as "Princess Octavia" didn't sit well with her. Octavia asserted that she didn't want to be called that in the future when she became Silvester's wife. This made Cecily grin uncontrollably.

"I'm sorry, Via-chan. Are you really going to be Silba's bride?"

"Yes!"

Listening to the conversation between her mother and Octavia, Silvester couldn't help but sigh.

"Mom, don't decide things on your own."

"Oh? Does Silvie not like Via?"

When Cecily asked Silvester, Octavia, who had been listening, started to tear up rapidly.

"It's not that I don't like her, but..."

Silvester began to explain, but Octavia's tears quickly disappeared, and she gave Silvester a big smile, hugging him tightly.

"That's okay. Getting a princess as your bride isn't something that happens every day, you know?"

Well, not exactly every day, more like almost never. However, Cecily's perception of the world differed from the norm, given her close relationships with the royal family, including Elizabeth and August.

Octavia was thrilled that Silvester's mother, Cecily, had approved, and she clung to Silvester tightly. The scene resembled that of a young child clinging to an older brother rather than an affectionate embrace between a man and a woman.

Silvester, being called someone's husband at the age of six, felt rather troubled. Furthermore, his prospective spouse was just three years old. At the same time, he hesitated to push Octavia away, considering her affection.

His dilemma was not over as Charlotte and Max joined the fray, just like the situation at the Wolford residence.

"Ah! Via is mean! And so is Charlotte!"

"Me too!"

"What? Wait, you two!"

With Octavia clinging to Silvester, he had no way to avoid this. He managed to catch Charlotte and Max, who were hugging him with force, but three against one proved too much, and they all tumbled down.

"Waaah!"

Silvester lay on his back with the three children clinging to him as if they were trying to shield him. Even though he had fallen, it seemed they had no intention of letting go. Silvester had a resigned expression as he succumbed to their actions.

"Via, this is quite inappropriate!"

"Oh dear."

Elizabeth restrained Octavia's behavior, which was unlike her usual princess-like demeanor, while Cecily smiled warmly at the charming scene. Elizabeth was aware that Octavia only acted this way in front of Silvester, so she didn't scold her too harshly. Nevertheless, the current situation wasn't exactly fitting for a royal princess. Thus, Elizabeth gently decided to separate Octavia from the group.

"Via, if you behave this way with Silba, he might not like you, you know?"

The effect of those words was significant. Upon hearing her mother Elizabeth's words, Octavia quickly moved away from Silvester as if she had heard a loud 'snap.'

"Uhm, Silba Oniisama..."

Seeing Octavia, who looked tearful as if she might have been disliked by Silvester, Silvester couldn't help but wear a wry smile that was unusual for a six-year-old.

"It's okay. I was just a little surprised."

To reassure Octavia, Silvester smiled gently and spoke. Octavia couldn't help but be captivated by his smile.

"Come on, Charlotte and Max, let go too."

Silvester left Octavia behind and addressed Charlotte and Max, who were still clinging to him.

"Yeah."

"No way!"

Max readily let go, but Charlotte stubbornly refused to move away from Silvester. Seeing Charlotte's reluctance to let go, Octavia pouted once more.

"That's unfair, Charlotte! Even Via let go!"

Octavia said this and tried to pull Charlotte away from Silvester.

"No way! He's Sharu's big brother! He won't dislike me!"

As Charlotte clung to Silvester with all her might, she protested vehemently.

Silvester, observing Charlotte's tenacity while she clung to him, muttered a single word.

"Really?"

Upon hearing those words, Charlotte froze in place.

"Huh? Uh..."

"If you don't let go, I might end up disliking you, Sharu."

While the tone of these words might sound like a joke to an adult, to three-year-old Charlotte, it sounded like a death sentence.

"Ugh... sniff..."

"Huh?"

Driven by the fear of being disliked by her beloved older brother, Charlotte began to tear up rapidly. Before Silvester had time to react to her state, Charlotte began to cry loudly.

"No! I don't want my big brother to hate me!"

Crying out loudly as if a verdict had been pronounced, Charlotte clung even tighter to Silvester.

Silvester had intended it as a minor jest, but he hadn't expected Charlotte to cry so heavily. To apologize and reassure her, he gently embraced Charlotte.

"I'm sorry, Sharu. I won't dislike you, okay?"

He said this while gently patting Charlotte on the back. In response, Charlotte raised her tear-streaked face.

"Re-really?"

"Yeah. I'm sorry, Sharu."

As Silvester consoled Charlotte while she was still hiccupping, he patted her on the head.

Charlotte, appearing relieved, raised her head after her tears and runny nose had messed up her face and clung to Silvester once more.

Though her crying had stopped, Charlotte was still sniffling. Silvester continued to pat her back when Octavia approached.

"This is unfair!"

Understanding that she wouldn't be disliked even if she clung to him, Octavia, who was blocked by Charlotte in the front, now clung to Silvester's arm.

"Well..."

Just when he thought he had separated her, she came back. Silvester glanced at Max with an expression that asked if he would do the same.

"Um..."

Charlotte, now sniffling but still attached to Silvester, looked back at Octavia.

"Max, you're going to stay over there, right?"

He looked at Max with the hope that he wouldn't join them, and Max was already seated on the sofa, munching on snacks.

"Aren't you going to eat some snacks?"

Asked while eating snacks with a mouthful of chips, Silvester sighed again, quite unlike a six-year-old, and, once again accompanied by Charlotte and Octavia, he headed towards the sofa.

The two mothers who were watching this scene...

"They are as close as ever, aren't they?"

"Indeed, they are."

In the face of such a familiar scene that played out every time, they could only smile wryly. ideas
