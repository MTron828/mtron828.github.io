"Your opponent is me!"

August, nominated by Shin, stood in front of Lawrence, who had attacked following Zest.

Seeing August blocking his path, Lawrence grinned slyly.

"So, the prince himself is willing to face me? I must have become quite important!"

Lawrence shouted and fired a fire magic attack at August as if it were a preemptive strike.

"Your Highness!"

The guards, Thor and Julius, shouted, but August had completely blocked Lawrence's magic with a magic barrier.

"Don't come near, all of you! I will fight this guy!"

"But, still!"

Thor persisted, but August deliberately ignored his words and activated a new spell while maintaining the barrier.

"Haaa!"

"What!? While keeping up the barrier!?"

While August was blocking the magic, Lawrence, who had planned to attack by circling around, was forced to evade an unexpected counterattack.

"Darn... I knew it, he's strong... Is he really a prince?"

"Hmph, one's status doesn't matter. What matters now is... whether I win or lose!"

August said this and started casting a series of different elemental spells from both his hands.

"What's wrong, Lawrence? Is that all you've got for a top executive of the demons?"

"Damn it!"

August was unusually aggressive, especially compared to how he had been so far, as he desperately evaded Lawrence's attacks.

Why was that?

When Zest had attacked, Shin had probably reflexively shouted August's name.

In such spontaneous situations, shouting the name of the person without thinking.

It was nothing more than a sign of trust from Shin.

Recognized by Shin.

Feeling that, August couldn't hide the exhilaration welling up inside him.

"Darn it!"

As August evaded the various magic attacks he unleashed, Lawrence attempted a counterattack.

However, unlike August, Lawrence couldn't perform simultaneous multiple magic activations, so his attacks became quite monotonous.

And then...

"Hah!"

While casting magic with one hand, August easily blocked it with a barrier using his other hand.

"Hah! Hah!"

No matter how much Lawrence attacked, his magic was effortlessly blocked by the magic barrier, and August seized the opportunity to counterattack.

In a moment of tension, Lawrence quickly started breathing heavily. Seeing Lawrence like that, August twisted his lips into a smug expression, showing an uncharacteristically disdainful face.

"How pitiful. Is this all a demon like you can do?"

Clearly, he had an attitude of looking down on himself. Augmented by his status as the crown prince of a powerful nation, August's attitude easily triggered Lawrence's anger.

"Shut up! You pampered brat who knows nothing about hardship! Don't look down on us!"

Angry, Lawrence cast a spell that demonstrated enough power for August to erect a double barrier using his magic and the defensive magical accessory given to him by Shin.

"Growing up all cushy without a care! Do you have any right to look down on us?"

Lawrence, who had been running away just moments ago, suddenly transformed and began unleashing high-powered spells one after the other.

"Hmph!"

August continued to defend against it, using both his own magic barrier and a defensive magical accessory received from Shin.

However, Lawrence's assault didn't stop.

"You even attacked Sweed! Launched attacks on Kurt! Instigated that greedy archbishop! You idiots knew nothing about it!"

"What!?"

August reacted to Lawrence's furious words.

"Are you saying Strom ordered those actions?"

"Not Strom! It was Zest!"

Lawrence seemed quite excited.

August began talking about facts that he was previously unaware of.

"You've been scheming behind the scenes like that, so why are you suddenly engaging in a direct confrontation now? What are you thinking?"

"I don't know what Strom-sama's thinking. How could I possibly know that!"

As they exchanged spells and defenses while verbally sparring, August and Lawrence continued their battle of words.

While August felt a sense of exhilaration, he remained relatively calm, while Lawrence showed no signs of calming down.

In reality, August had purposely adopted a condescending attitude towards Lawrence.

The demons defeated previously were all commoners of the Empire.

When it comes to the Empire's commoners, they were the target of exploitation by the nobles.

That's why, once the commoners, who had become demons and gained power, killed the Emperor and all the nobles. Therefore, Lawrence and others who were still loyal to Strom were likely former commoners, August thought.

So August planned to provoke Lawrence by playing the role of an arrogant and condescending prince, which he knew they despised. As a result, Lawrence fell right into August's scheme and became furious. In his state of excitement, he even revealed things that August didn't know.

It was a gain to have learned facts that were unknown until now, but it seemed unlikely that he could gather information about the frontal confrontation that was ongoing. Thus, August decided to change his approach.

"Hah!"

"Don't underestimate me!"

What August released was a water magic spell. He didn't particularly concentrate it at high pressure; it seemed more like he was trying to wash away Lawrence with a large amount of water. Instead of dodging, Lawrence erected a magical barrier to defend himself.

"Do you think you can defeat me, a demon, with such magic?"

"I'm not planning to defeat you with this, really."

"What!?"

"Hah!"

Continuing, August unleashed his signature lightning magic. However, he directed this magic to miss Lawrence.

"What are you aiming at... gahh!?"

The moment August seemed to have missed his target, Lawrence was struck by lightning all over his body.

"You fool... the magic should've missed..."

Unable to defend properly and with his entire body scorched by the lightning, Lawrence collapsed to his knees and fell.

August walked closer to Lawrence and said, "Didn't you know? Lightning travels through water."

"What... what the heck... I've never heard of that..."

"I didn't know either, but Shin taught me."

"Damn... Shin... Wolford... They'll do anything to... interfere with us..."

In response to Lawrence's begrudging mutter, August countered his previous words.

"Weren't you just saying earlier that I was a pampered, trouble-free rich kid?"

"In reality... you're a prince..."

"I don't know about the Empire, but in our country, someone as ordinary as you wouldn't be able to ascend to the throne."

Arlsheid does not follow primogeniture for royal succession. Among the princes and princesses, only those recognized for their talents can ascend to the throne. That's why August couldn't claim the title of Crown Prince until the ceremony was held.

"That's right... I studied tirelessly, sacrificed sleep, and underwent grueling magical training."

As August murmured this, Thor and Julius, who were observing him up close, wore solemn expressions. They must have been reminded of the August from that time.

"That's how I've worked hard. The magic I used to defeat you just now was one of those efforts."

"Because of Wolford..."

"That's right. After meeting Shin, I've been able to grow even more. I don't intend to stop honing my skills. I want to get closer to him, even a little."

"..."

"Compared to that, what about you? Dissatisfied with your own position and accepting demonization on top of that... there's no reason for someone like you to defeat me."

"Don't act so high and mighty... You don't know anything..."

Despite being looked down upon by August, Lawrence, in his near-death state, summoned his last bit of strength to resist.

"Do you understand? Just because we're commoners, no matter how much effort we put in, no matter how much we achieve, we're not acknowledged. The frustration of being considered useless nobles, using us as they please because we're just commoners... The hatred of having everything taken away..."

Lawrence muttered, as if he were expelling the hatred within him.

"All that hatred... "

"..."

"In the Empire... we commoners aren't... considered human. We're treated like livestock..."

Lawrence's outpouring of hatred was enough to make August feel oppressed.

"It was Lord Strom who saved us... that esteemed figure helped us relieve the built-up hatred of many years... turned us from livestock into humans..."

"You're a fool... you're a demon..."

"Well... no matter what the process was, that doesn't matter. What matters is... we became human thanks to Lord Strom's help..."

With Lawrence's words, August understood.

The reason why the demons were willing to sacrifice their lives to obey Strom's orders.

It was because Strom was the first to acknowledge their worth.

To destroy the Empire, Strom needed them.

Even if it meant they were mere pawns...

It wasn't the unfair treatment they had received before, but as comrades with a shared goal.

For the first time, they were needed.

"So... I... we... will absolutely obey Lord Strom's orders... If we're told to die..."

While saying this, Lawrence raised his upper body.

"I'd gladly die!!"

He shouted and, summoning his last reserves of strength, made a suicide attack towards August.

"!!"

August, who had been overwhelmed by Lawrence's outpouring of hatred, hesitated for a moment, thinking that the last-ditch attack might succeed.

"Your Highness!"

Thor, who had been closely watching Lawrence the whole time, sent a blade of wind towards him.

"Gah!!"

Lawrence, who had been attempting a suicide attack, took Thor's wind blade head-on and collapsed once again.

"This... hah... it's not a bad way to go... pretty unexpected..."

"..."

"Lord Strom... please... wait for me in hell..."

Lawrence muttered this as his final words, and then he passed away.

"Your Highness..."

"...I'm sorry, Thor. Thank you for saving me."

"No, it's my duty."

"But still..."

Saying this, August looked down at Lawrence, who had shown an extraordinary level of loyalty to Strom even as he died.

"It was an incredibly intense loyalty."

"Yes. I, too, am willing to give my life to protect Your Highness, but..."

Thor, like August, looked at Lawrence.

"I can't bear to die for something so meaningless."

"The darkness in the Empire must have been so deep..."

"..."

Confronted with the reality of the demons, both August and Thor felt a sense of helplessness.

Moreover, there was something that bothered August.

"Wait in hell first...? That means... it's like..."

August thought about it.

It's as if Strom may follow in Lawrence's footsteps.
