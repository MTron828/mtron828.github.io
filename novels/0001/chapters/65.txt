August and Bishop Makina, after concluding their discussions at the accommodation for the Eus Holy Kingdom delegation, headed to the restaurant, which was also the meeting place.

Already present in a private room were Els' naval diplomat, who appeared to have dark circles under his eyes, possibly from thinking about the post-war benefits mentioned by August yesterday.

"Good morning, Your Highness August, and who is this?"

"Oh, good morning. I've taken over as the representative from Archbishop Fuller since yesterday. I'm Bishop Makina."

"Pleased to meet you, the representative from Els. I am Hamil-Nabal, and my position is that of a bishop. Nice to meet you."

"That's very courteous. I am Usama-Nabal. By the way, what happened to Archbishop Fuller? Changing representatives must be quite significant, right?"

"Well, you see... there was a little trouble, and he was forcibly repatriated to his homeland... So, I was appointed as his replacement."

"Trouble... Can't you tell me more about it?"

"I'm sorry, but..."

"I see... well, that can't be helped, I suppose. Shall we start today's meeting then?"

"I'd like to, but... I haven't had breakfast yet. Would it be okay to have a meal first?"

"Oh, again?!"

"Both Bishop Makina and I have been quite busy since the morning. What about the naval diplomat?"

"I can't bear to wait while everyone else eats, so I'll join you."

Ultimately, just like yesterday, the meeting began with breakfast.

The difference from yesterday was that the representative from Eus was not Archbishop Fuller, and Bishop Makina's food intake was significantly less compared to Fuller's.

"Bishop Makina... is that amount sufficient for you?"

"Yes. The teachings of the Creator's Child forbid excessive nutrient intake. It's the minimum bread and soup. Any excess food should be shared with the people."

"You're quite different from Archbishop Fuller yesterday. However... it's completely opposite to our country. We believe that wealth is the highest virtue."

"I had planned to tell Els' merchants this eventually. If they keep pursuing profit at all costs, they will make enemies in various directions and eventually destroy themselves. It would be advisable to change their actions before it comes to that, don't you think?"

"...However... It might be considered inappropriate to say this, but... that's precisely why we can benefit from it, isn't it?"

August looked at Naval, who seemed to have finally realized the situation.

"Hmm, it seems you've finally figured it out."

"Yes, why didn't I realize it earlier? Perhaps the scale of the situation was beyond comprehension."

"What do you mean by 'beyond comprehension'?"

"...It might not be a topic for discussion in front of the clergy of the Creator's Child, but... what's currently in the former Imperial territory?"

"No matter how you put it, it's a group of demons, right? And an abundance of monsters spreading to neighboring countries..."

It seemed Makina had also realized.

"Exactly, in the current former Imperial territory... let's call it the 'Demon Realm' for now. All that remains there are demons and monsters."

The original Imperial citizens are no longer there.

"If we were to defeat the demons, and to some extent, eliminate the monsters... what would be left afterward?"

"A vast land that is not controlled by anyone..."

"This land is supposed to be evenly distributed among neighboring countries. Els and Eus would also get a share, so please understand that."

"Well... we don't share a border with the Empire, so there's nothing we can do about it."

"In that case... what about our interests?"

Having heard Makina's words, August finally got to the main point.

"Even though we talk about distributing land, it's meaningless unless people live there and engage in production activities."

Naval nodded in understanding, and Makina seemed to agree.

"Engaging in production activities means that the people there will need facilities and infrastructure for their livelihood."

August continued to explain step by step.

Naval and Makina listened attentively without interrupting.

"We don't know the current state of the existing cities, but extensive reconstruction is likely necessary. For that reconstruction..."

August looked at Naval.

"We have secured the consent of various countries by entrusting it to Els."

Upon hearing those words, Naval could feel goosebumps all over his body.

"We are planning to handle everything from procuring materials to construction. The contracting parties will include various countries, including Arlshyde. The contracted companies will be limited to Els' commercial firms."

"That's... that's an absolutely massive undertaking..."

"What do you think? While we can't distribute territory, this should be a very lucrative opportunity for Els, right? Of course, the choice of the contracting firm will be determined through a bidding process."

"...With a business of this magnitude, we can't just sit idly by. I understand. For the sake of future profits, we'll invest our resources now."

"I see. Thank you. I'm counting on you."

"The feeling is mutual. We appreciate your cooperation."

"Now, about Eus..."

Up to this point, all the discussion had been about Els, and Eus had not been mentioned.

"What kind of faith was practiced by the Church of the Creator's Child in the former Empire?"

Upon hearing August's question, a displeased expression appeared on Makina's face.

To be clear, August said, "I don't consider them to be followers of the same Creator's Child faith as us."

"I've heard that as well."

The Creator's Child faith was the only religion in this world, but there were different interpretations of its doctrine.

The widely accepted doctrine of the Creator's Child faith stated that there were several precepts to be followed, and by adhering to them, one would accumulate good deeds, which would lead them to the grace of the Creator God. As a result, these precepts allowed for a clear distinction between good and evil in this world, and each country established its laws based on these standards of good and evil.

However, the nature of religion often led to the creation of various sects in different regions and environments. In the central church, the interpretation was that the Creator's Child could be both male and female, and marriage and childbirth were allowed. Of course, acts driven by personal desires, such as those of Fuller, were prohibited by the precepts.

On the other hand, in some regions, the interpretation was that the Creator's Child was a being dedicated to the gods, and therefore, marriage and such activities were forbidden. In this context, what kind of Creator's Child faith existed in the former Empire?

"The Imperial Church taught that we are the children of the gods, and the gods watch over us. Therefore, if you honestly report your actions to the church and make donations, all your deeds will be forgiven. They preached such outrageous things."

"So... you're saying that no matter how bad your actions were, you could be forgiven if you just reported them honestly?"

"It seems like it was actually the case. However, you needed to make donations for it to work, which is why it didn't penetrate among the poor commoners."

"As a result, the nobles mistakenly believed that their actions were acts forgiven by the gods, and they thought they could do anything to the common people. It's truly... an outrageous situation."

Instead of confession, they had 'reporting.'

As a result, the nobles had no guilt about their actions, and the followers of the Imperial Church, who could be seen as supporters of the Creator's Child faith in the Empire, became increasingly wealthy, as they were able to set the donation amounts arbitrarily.

"And so, this branch of the Imperial Church that followed this Creator's Child faith is no longer in existence."

"Yes, so that means..."

"We'll need churches in the newly rebuilt cities, right? The churches with your mentioned 'corrupt doctrine' have been inadvertently purged by the demons."

"Meaning, we can build the churches of the 'right doctrine' in the new cities..."

"That's the idea. Well, in the countries that will receive land distribution, the central doctrine of the Creator's Child faith is prevalent, so there should be no problem with the idea of new churches."

"Yes, having more churches is a good thing."

August presented two advantages for the two countries:

Entrusting Els with the construction work, including the reconstruction, in the new cities.
An increase in the number of main branch Creator's Child faith churches.

To achieve these goals, it was essential to eliminate the demons and monsters that had spread across the Demon Realm.

"Now, there may be fewer practical benefits for Eus compared to Els, but... Eus won't make any further demands regarding this situation, will they?"

"Well, it was our mistake to let that guy represent us. In this situation, we need to accept any deal that benefits us even a little bit..."

"Will you cooperate then?"

"Originally, turning a blind eye to the threat of the demons goes against our doctrine. Of course, we'll cooperate."

"I see. Details and actual operational planning will come later, but for now... I'm counting on you."

Saying that, August extended his right hand on the table.

"Yes, I'm counting on you too."

"Thank you."

Naval and Makina took August's hand and shook hands.

Thus, the World Alliance was formed, consisting of Arlshyde, Els, Eus, and the surrounding nations.

"Hey, you're back. How did it go?"

"Oh, Els and Eus agreed. The official signing will happen at a later date after working out the details."

Oh! Amazing! They really managed to establish the World Alliance!

"What's wrong?"

"Well... it turns out August is quite something..."

"How did you see me all this time?"

"Huh? A mischievous and crafty prince who enjoys teasing and playing pranks?"

"Wait, you..."

Wait, why is August trembling? He thought he gave a pretty accurate response...

"The only one who sees His Highness that way is you, Shin."

"Yeah, in the outside world, he was generally regarded as a rare genius – intelligent, handsome, and exceptionally skilled in magic."

"...Hey, Freid... What do you mean by 'was'?"

"Oh, my apologies. But when I see the way you and Shin interact, it feels so familiar."

"Seems like Shin might be the root of all evil after all."

"Why? That's just August's true nature. Besides, if you call me evil, Sicily will get mad, you know?"

"Hmm?"

He looked at Sicily.

"Oh... Ahaha..."

Huh?

"I didn't know His Highness was like this until I watched him interact with Shin... So I thought it might be thanks to Shin."

She's laughing vaguely. I guess this sight is unexpected for the people of Arlsheid...

"Seriously, as soon as he came back..."

"Seriously?"

August?

"Well... he was truly amazing, you know? Yesterday and today. Always in control, and in the end, he convinced the representatives of Els and Eus to agree to join the alliance."

"I haven't seen you for a while, and you're so gallant."

"Oops, I misspoke."

Laughter erupted within the team. They really became a great team.

"By the way, you mentioned introducing us, right?"

"There's going to be a celebratory dinner for the alliance afterward, so I'll introduce you then. We have some free time now, so let's meet up again in the evening."

Is that so? Will the trilateral talks be over after this?

Since it was still morning, they had lunch with August and the others before heading to the restaurant where the evening event would take place.

While the negotiations took place in a private room on the second floor, the evening event would be held on the first floor.

The delegations from Els and Eus would also be coming, so it would be quite a large gathering.

"Welcome, representatives of the Arlsheid Kingdom."

Upon arriving at the restaurant, the waiter announced their arrival to the people inside, and the door swung open. As they entered, they were greeted with a big round of applause.

Oh... It's amazing. I was wondering how the talks would turn out, but it seems to be a festive mood.

August is really an amazing guy...

"Nice to meet you, Your Highness August. And these are the renowned members of the Ultimate Magicians... the Demon Lord and the Saint, right?"

This seems to be Els's accent. You can instantly tell from their way of speaking.

"Yeah, this is the Demon Lord, Shin Wolford, and this is the Saint, Sicily von Claude."

"Pleasure to meet you. I am Usama Nabal from the Els Free Trade Union. Please feel free to call me Usama."

"I'm Shin Wolford. Nice to meet you."

"I'm Sicily von Claude. Please be kind to me."

"Oh... As the rumors say, you are quite the beautiful young lady. I envy the Demon Lord."

"Demon Lord...?"

"Oh... Sorry..."

Gradually, it seems like their nicknames have become their actual names. They just called him "Demon Lord."

"Oh? Aren't the people from Eus going to greet us?"

"Well, we met this morning, so we were planning to greet them later."

"I see. By the way, Demon Lord..."

"That's what I'm talking about, calling me 'Demon Lord'..."

"I have something I'd like to discuss privately, if you don't mind."

"Nabal, we haven't even started the dinner yet. Can it wait until later?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, I got ahead of myself."

He returned to the Els delegation with a chuckle.

"Now, while the detailed discussions and formal signing are yet to come, I'm delighted that we've reached a basic agreement on forming this crucial alliance for the sake of saving this world from crisis and for the development of our respective countries. So, to our future... 'Cheers!'"

"Cheers!"

The standing dinner party began with August's toast.

However...

"Demon Lord! About that conversation earlier!"

"Hey! Not fair, Nabal! We wanted to talk to the Demon Lord too!"

"That's right! You can't hog him all to yourself!"

"Ugh! Stop making so much noise! It's first come, first served!"

Els' merchants all gathered around me at once.

"Hehe, Shin, you're quite popular, huh?"

"I don't want to be popular with these old guys..."

"Oh? So you'd rather be popular with young girls?"

...Wait, Sicily's smile is kind of creepy. And she's subtly pinching my arm.

Ouch! That hurts, it's subtly painful!

"Heh... They really seem to be in love, huh..."

"Yeah, that's right... Ours used to be cute too..."

"That walrus?"

"Not a walrus!"

"What are you talking about?"

"Elephant seals!"

Is this really happening?! What's with this comedy routine?

"Haha! Hahaha!"

Sicily finds it hilarious.

"Oh, you got a good laugh there."

"I'm glad. It was worth telling the truth."

"Worth telling the truth, huh?"

"Hahaha! Hahahahaha!"

Sicily can't stop laughing; she's clearly amused.

"Haha, phew... Hahaha, sorry, I apologize."

"No, no, it's not every day that you get a laugh from the famous Saint, you know."

"If you were a waitress, you'd be smiling all the time."

"That would be just a polite smile. It's not like I find myself so funny."

"Is that so?"

"You guys! Did you come here to do stand-up comedy?"

Oops! I accidentally made a comment. The members of the Els delegation seem surprised.

"Wow, what a sharp comeback..."

"Even though they call him the Magic King, he's got a sharp tongue..."

"Right there!? That's what scares you!?"

Oh, I did it again. The members of the Els delegation are saying, "Oh."

"No, I'm impressed. I respect the Demon Lord."

"I don't need that kind of respect!"

"Oh!"

"Enough already!"

Finally, it seems like it's over. By the way, Sicily has been laughing all along.

"Okay... So, what's the point of all this?"

"Oh, right! Actually, Demon Lord, you're known for being an excellent magic item creator, right? So, there's that thing that's being used between countries... you know..."

"That thing? Oh, you mean the communication device?"

"That's right, that! Can we make a few arrangements for it? Of course, we'll pay for it. Please!"

"Oh, Nabal, that's sneaky! Demon Lord, I mean, Your Majesty, could you arrange that for us too?"

"We'd like that too!"

Wow... They all bowed down at once... How badly do they want those communication devices? I mean, a communication device that allows instant long-distance information exchange is something merchants would definitely want, but...

"Well... Even if you want one, the communication devices are going to be sold by the upcoming merchant guild. Moreover, for now, they are meant for communication between nations, so it also requires approval from the country. Even if I wanted to, there's not much I can do..."

"So, if I understand correctly, we can place an order with this merchant guild and get one with approval?"

"Well, that's one way to put it..."

The Els merchants express their delight upon hearing that they can buy it from the merchant guild.

"But the merchant guild itself hasn't been established yet."

With that statement, their expressions turned to despair.

The reactions from the Els merchants are quite interesting.

"When... when will it be established?"

"They said they'll be able to open the store after preparing it once this meeting is over, so they'll open it as soon as we return."

"Is that so? We should return through Arlsheid directly instead of going back to Els!"

"That's a good idea!"

"Right, let's tell everyone! We'll stop by Arlsheid on our way back!"

Decided on the spot. Els is supposed to be further east of the former empire's eastern border countries, but won't that be a seriously roundabout route?

"Well, this turned out to be quite a good diplomatic move."

"It certainly did. The dream of long-distance communication..."

"Dreams are expanding."

Hahaha, the Els merchants are still contemplating the yet-unseen communication device.

"Shin! Claude! Come over here!"

"Oh, sorry. Ogh is calling us..."

"Excuse us. We'll be right there."

"Is this, perhaps, your debut for everyone here?"

"I think that's probably the case."

Excusing themselves from the Els merchants, they head over to Ogh. All the members of the team are already gathered there.

"I'm sorry for interrupting your meal, but I'd like you to pay a little attention."

With Ogh's words, the Els and East delegations turned their attention to him.

"The preparations for our alliance with the demon territories are complete. But when it comes to the demons themselves... they are extremely formidable."

The words made the delegations from both nations start to stir.

"But, Your Majesty, according to rumors circulating in the city, the demons that have appeared this time are said to be considerably weaker than the demons that Sage-sama defeated previously..."

"Makina Bishop, it's not true. People are making such rumors because they're only looking at the results. In the Kingdom of Swid, there are people who have actually fought against demons. How about asking them? Is there anyone here who felt that demons are weak?"

Since this is the Kingdom of Swid, many Swidian soldiers are stationed here as security personnel. When asked whether demons are weak or not...

"As you can see, nobody agrees."

No one raised their hands, and they were all looking down. Some of them were even trembling.

To be honest... if Your Highness August and the Ultimate Magicians hadn't come... this country would have been doomed..."

One of the security personnel said these words.

"But they held out until they arrived, right? So..."

"We were able to hold out thanks to the defensive magical tools created by His Majesty, the Demon Lord. Thanks to those magical tools, we were able to hold out, but our attacks couldn't get through at all. Even with the Demon Lord's defensive magical tools, the demons easily broke through our defenses... and many of our citizens suffered greatly..."

The soldier replied with frustration, biting his lips.

"What saved us was everyone here, the Ultimate Magicians! I... no, the Swid Kingdom citizens have great gratitude and respect for the Ultimate Magicians! Thank you very much!"

All the security personnel simultaneously lowered their heads.

In the Kingdom of Kurt, they didn't have any casualties, but here...

Not preparing well is still a lingering regret.

Seeming to have a gloomy expression, Cecily gently held my hand.

When I looked at Cecily, she had a worried expression, but she also gave me a smile.

That alone... made me feel a little relieved.

"But, how will you defeat such powerful demons?"

"We will do it. The Ultimate Magicians will."

Oh, the audience began to stir.

"Let me introduce you again. Led by the Demon Lord Shin-Wolford, we are the Ultimate Magicians."

When Ogh introduced us, the audience applauded.

It's the security personnel who are applauding.

Right, let's provide security.

The Els and East delegations seemed confused.

"We will deal with the demons. We would like each nation to assist in subduing the demons and monsters spreading throughout the demon territories."

"But... entrusting everything to kids who have just reached adulthood at the age of fifteen or sixteen... even as adults, it's hard for us."

"As adults, we do have our reservations."

"Then let me ask you, are there individuals in your country who can single-handedly subdue a disaster-level magical beast?"

"Wha... single-handedly subdue a disaster-level magical beast!?"

"That's absurd... disaster-level magical beasts require the entire army to stand a chance at subduing. There's no way any human could do it!"

There's no human capable of that... That's what everyone's faces are saying as they hear these words.

"However, to subdue demons, that level of power is necessary. Because..."

Both delegations were left speechless. The security personnel, in particular, turned pale and were trembling. Trauma, perhaps?

"If that's... if that's true, then it's the end of the world!"

"Oh, dear God... save us..."

"What are you talking about? Didn't I just say that? We repelled the demons who attacked the Swid Kingdom earlier. Afterward, we also repelled the demon who appeared in the Kurt Kingdom."

The delegations from both countries were even more astonished by Ogh's words.

"Is that... Are you serious...?"

"They're all individuals capable of single-handedly subduing disaster-level magical beasts."

"What did you say!?"

"I-Is it true!?"

"Yes, otherwise, how could we repel the demons? Does that ease your concerns?"

"Well... yes, I suppose..."

"Is there something else you want to say?"

"No, no, it's nothing..."

"Is that so? If it's difficult for you to say, shall I say it instead? 'With a force like this, Arlsheid will become the next threat after the demons...' Does that sound about right?"

"No, it's just... something like that..."

"Such concerns are only natural," Cecily said.

Both delegations struggled to respond to Ogh's straightforward remarks.

This is too straightforward.

"I understand both countries' concerns and the concerns of other nations as well. However, I organized this team knowing that. Do you know why?"

"For the sake of world peace."

"That's correct, Bishop Makina. For the sake of world peace, I organized this team. So, let me make this declaration."

The venue was now completely under Ogh's control. This was the first time I'd seen this side of Ogh.

"The Ultimate Magicians are not exclusive to the Arlsheid Kingdom. After this incident is settled, we will send personnel from various nations to monitor them. As a supranational organization, we will act for the sake of world peace."

After that declaration, the venue fell silent. Everyone was digesting Ogh's words, and gradually, emotions began to surface, and eventually...

"Hooray!"

The venue erupted in cheers.

"That's great! In case something happens, the Ultimate Magicians will come to our aid, right?"

"This is truly an organization that embodies the teachings of the Creator Faith! It's wonderful!"

Welcoming voices came from the Els and East envoys. They were pleased not only with the guidelines but also because personnel would be sent from various countries.

With the presence of monitoring representatives from various nations, they wouldn't be able to do anything reckless.

"Is that so? When will this organization begin operating? If that's the case, we should start selecting personnel as soon as possible."

"That's what I wanted to discuss."

"I see."

"In two and a half years."

"Huh?"

"What's the matter? Did you forget? We're first-year students at the Arlsheid Advanced Magic Academy, right? In other words, the organization won't officially operate until we graduate."

I've been forgetting that recently, but we're still just first-year students at the academy.

"Come to think of it... that's right."

"It's such a significant force that I completely forgot about it."

Especially the Els representative seemed disappointed. I wonder why? Did they want to provide escorts or something? However, Ogh refused, saying it would take away jobs from the monster hunters who made a living as escorts.

"Just when I thought I had sent personnel to foster good relationships with all of you!"

"You shouldn't say that!"

What are you scheming?

Maria, Alice, and Yuri seem to have mixed feelings about it.
