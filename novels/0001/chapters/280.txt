The request I received after a long time was a plea for assistance from a remote village in the Kingdom of Kurt.

The village's only water source, which supplied water through an aqueduct from the river, had been cut off due to a landslide, leaving the village without water.

Even if we were to remove the debris manually, it would take a long time, and due to its remote location, it was not possible to bring in a large number of personnel. That's why the request was made to us.

Well, this kind of request is right up my alley. I can fly to the remote mountains, and I can use magic to clear the debris.

I headed to the Kingdom of Kurt through a gate and, from there, went directly to the scene using levitation magic, quickly removing the debris. However, being in the mountains, there was no guarantee that another landslide wouldn't occur.

To be prepared for such a situation, I made the aqueduct coming from the river underground, large enough for people to enter and inspect it if necessary. I built it quite robustly, so even if a landslide were to happen in the future, it should be fine.

After completing the job and receiving words of gratitude from the villagers, I returned to the office with a sense of accomplishment.

There, I received unexpected news.

"What?! Sicily went into labor at the royal castle!?"

The news was about Sicily, who had been visiting the royal castle for leisure, going into labor and planning to give birth there.

"Why didn't you inform me right away!?" I exclaimed, and Catalina apologized with a guilty look.

"I'm sorry. His Highness August said not to tell Lord Shin until he finishes his work because it might distract him... And besides, labor has just started, so there's still time to inform him after he finishes his work."

Certainly, as Catalina said, if I had received such news during work, I might have been too preoccupied to concentrate. It's also true that labor can take some time, so August's decision was probably correct.

Honestly, I understand in my head that August's decision was correct, but the fact that I was accomplishing requests without knowing what Sicily was going through makes me feel a strong sense of guilt.

In any case, I hurriedly contacted August to head to the royal castle.

"It's August."

Furthermore, even Silver, who had followed them, got lost. As I smiled wryly at the situation, I was informed of something incredible by August.

When Silver, who had gotten lost, wandered into the castle's courtyard, there were men planning to kill Ellie, Sicily, and the children.

The moment I heard that story, my hatred for the criminals swelled in my heart.

"Calm down. As you can see, the children, Ellie, and Lady Wolford are all safe," August reassured me and began to tell the rest of the story.

Upon hearing the criminals' assassination plan, Silver tried to escape, but at that moment, Shal and Via appeared, and the criminals noticed them. Silver and Shal were nearly killed, but I activated the magical tools I had given them to fend off the attackers.

Sicily, who arrived at the scene, managed to apprehend the culprits. It turned out that Sicily went into labor at the same time they captured the criminals.

I see... So the children were scolded for acting recklessly on their own.

Shal and Via managed to escape from their escort knights and maids.

Silver tried to handle things on his own after losing sight of them.

Poor Max.

After finishing the summary, August crossed his arms and said, "But I wonder why Lady Wolford arrived immediately when the children were in trouble?"

August seemed puzzled about why Sicily had rushed to help the children in their dire situation. I explained, "Oh, you know, Silver activated the magical tool back then, right?"

"I thought that was a reckless move, but it turned out to be the best course of action."

"In reality, I had equipped Sicily with a magically linked tool that would activate when Silver activated his."

Upon hearing this, August nodded in understanding. "I see. Lady Wolford probably detected Silver's use of the magical tool through magical reconnaissance."

"She used to come to the royal castle frequently for meetings and such before we got married, so she could rush here immediately through the gate. It's truly a result of various things falling into place."

"Ah, I see."

Finally, as we wrapped up the conversation about the situation, I noticed that the children were gazing at me intently.

Their faces seemed slightly frightened.

Come to think of it, I did show some hostility a while ago...

Thinking that might be why they were scared, I smiled at the children.

"Daddy!"

As I tried to reassure the children, Shal jumped into my arms.

"Whoops."

I quickly caught Shal, who clung to me while crying.

She must have been really frightened by Ellie...

That's what I thought, but it seems that wasn't the case.

"Daddy! Save mommy!"

Tears and runny nose covering her face, Shal pleaded with me.

I see, Sicily said she went into labor immediately after capturing the criminals.

So Shal and the others were there at that time.

Seeing Shal's reaction, she must have been worried after witnessing Sicily's unusual condition.

Suddenly, when I looked at the children, Silver, with an anxious expression, came to my side and tugged at my clothes.

To reassure the children, I patted Shal's back and ruffled Silver's hair.

"Don't worry. Daddy will definitely protect mommy."

As I said that, Shal showed a smile as if her tears from moments ago were a lie.

Well, her face was still covered in tears and runny nose...

"If Daddy's here, I feel safe!"

She said that while hugging me.

Oh, there's some runny nose on my clothes...

I thought, but for Shal, who seemed anxious, I let her do as she pleased.

And I crouched down to make eye contact with Silver, who was still tugging at my clothes.

Then Silver, perhaps thinking he would be scolded again, flinched for a moment.

However, Silver and the others had already received a thorough scolding from Ellie.

I thought it might not be necessary to scold them further, so I hugged Silver while holding Shal.

"Dad?"

"I heard it from August. Silver, you protected Shal and the others, right? You're amazing, just as I expected from Silver. You make your dad proud."

As I said this while hugging them, Silver squirmed in my arms.

"Dad, it's embarrassing."

"Why?"

"Because everyone's watching..."

It seemed he was embarrassed to be hugged and praised in front of everyone.

"Big brother, you were so cool!"

Shal said that and then got down from my arm to hug Silver.

"Whoa!"

Silver was surprised when Shal suddenly hugged him, but she quickly let go and turned toward me.

"Big brother, come in front of Shal and make a 'boom' and help us, big brother helped us!"

Shal was trying to convey Silver's heroics to me with her gestures and expressions. Her movements were so adorable that I couldn't help but smile.

"Silver, you were so cool, sir!"

Even Via came over and gently leaned against Silver. In her eyes as she looked at Silver, a clear affection could be seen.

Huh? Via is only three years old, right? She might not even be fully aware of things, and yet she's already looking at Silver like that? Uncle here is seriously surprised!

Look, even Via's dad has a bitter expression! Max didn't say anything, but he was looking at Silver with sparkling eyes, completely admiring him as a big brother.

"You're quite the ladies' man, Silver."

I said that, and Silver blushed and turned away. He seemed embarrassed.

As I was grinning at Silver's reaction, we heard noisy footsteps approaching. Could it be that Sicily has given birth already?

Thinking that, I was anxiously following the direction of the footsteps when, without any knocking, the door burst open.

Everyone was startled by this, but when we saw who had burst in, we all relaxed.

The reason being...

"Is it true that Sister Sicily is giving birth?"

The one who had burst in was Mei-chan, wearing the uniform of the Earlshide Advanced Magic Academy.

"She hasn't given birth yet," August said, and Mei-chan breathed a sigh of relief.

"Phew, that's a relief. It was worth rushing back."

Saying this, Mei-chan smiled cheerfully, and from behind her, we heard footsteps again.

"Princess Mei, please don't go ahead by yourself!"

"That's right! If we get separated, we won't know where to go!"

The two young men and women entered the room, complaining about Mei-chan.

Both of them were wearing the Earlshide Advanced Magic Academy uniforms.

As soon as the two of them entered the room, they froze when they noticed August, Ellie, and Via in the room.

"Oh, um... We... We apologize for this tremendous rudeness!"

"Please forgive us!"

The two—Agnes-san and Colin-kun—bowed with such intensity that it seemed like they might bend in half.

"Don't worry, you two. You were probably dragged along by Mei, right? It's all Mei's fault."

"What?! Why do you say that, big bro... sir?"

Agnes-san and Colin-kun weren't at fault, but Mei-chan wanted to complain to August, who declared that it was all Mei's fault.

Well, that's understandable...

August now looks really scary.

"Um... Big brother?"

"Running through the corridors of the royal castle and opening a door without knocking..."

"Eep!"

Mei-chan let out a short scream.

August's face contorted with anger, and he seemed to be discharging small sparks from his body.

His appearance... was quite reminiscent of an evil mastermind.

I can understand why Mei-chan let out a scream...

The children were also frightened and clung to Ellie.

"This... is your punishment."

"Eep! Please don't touch me in that state! If you touch me..."

"If I touch you?"

"I'll get electrified... Kyaaah!"

Mei-chan, who was grabbed by the head by August in his electrified state, let out a scream and collapsed.

Well, even if he's electrified, he's probably only using a low-frequency treatment similar to a TENS machine, so she shouldn't die.

However, even a powerful TENS machine can be painful.

Seeing Mei-chan collapse on the floor, Agnes-san clung to Colin-kun, trembling.

Perhaps he was worried that the punishment might be directed at him too, but August's punishment was only for Mei-chan.

"Ugh... I'm so sorry..."

"Really... You should be setting an example for Via. What good are you if you show her such a pathetic side?"

"Oh, Via-chan is back!"

Not even August's lecture seemed to faze her, as she quickly ran to the children.

Upon seeing their retreating figures, August let out a deep, truly deep sigh.

"...You guys are causing us a lot of trouble."

August spoke to Agnes-san and Colin-kun, showing genuine signs of exhaustion.

"No, um, we're always helped by Princess Mei, so..."

"And, well, we don't really... um..."

Agnes-san and Colin-kun seemed like they were trying to offer explanations or reassurance, but it was clear that they couldn't deny having caused some inconvenience.

"...I'm really sorry."

August said that and lowered his head to the two.

"P-Please, Your Highness, stop that!"

"Y-Yes! Really, we don't mind at all!"

Bowing to the Crown Prince was probably akin to torture for them, and they were hastily trying to defend August.

As for the main culprit causing all this...

"Welcome back, Miss Mei."

"I'm home!"

"Haha! Mei-oneechan, you screamed!"

"Mu! Forget about that, Sharl-chan!"

"Welcome back!"

"Wow, Max-kun, you're here too! It's been a while!"

While the three people who were struggling because of Mei-chan were trying to deal with the situation, she was happily playing with the children.

She seemed to be having a great time being surrounded by the toddlers.

"Welcome back, Mei-nee-chan."

"I'm back, Silver-kun. Won't you come over here?"

"I-I'm good..."

Despite the children clinging to Mei-chan, Silver kept his distance.

It's not like Silver dislikes Mei-chan or anything...

Mei-chan is now a senior at the Earlshide Advanced Magic Academy.

She's already eighteen.

With an ideal figure that shows off her best features and conceals her less desirable traits.

Alice has been grinding her teeth while watching Mei-chan's steady growth...

Furthermore, Mei-chan is a member of the Earlshide Royal Family and is August's younger sister.

She's a perfect beauty, both inside and out.

From Silver's perspective, she's an older and pretty sister who is now aware of her own self and the differences between the genders.

It's understandable that Silver has some reservations about hugging her now.

I understand Silver's feelings, but it seems that Mei-chan is feeling that Silver, who used to happily hug her until just a year or two ago, has suddenly distanced himself from her.

Whether she was feeling lonely or not, Mei-chan's actions during times like these were always the same.

"Don't say that, look! Hug!"

"Wow!"

She forcefully hugged him.

Silver was bewildered by Mei-chan hugging him.

He seemed more embarrassed than anything.

His face was bright red.

Seeing Silver's reaction, Via puffed out her cheeks and tried to squeeze herself between Silver and Mei-chan.

"Princess Mei! That's improper!"

However, Mei-chan didn't pay any attention.

"Huh? Via, too! Hug!"

"Wow!"

Via got caught up in it as well.

"Mei-oneechan, Sharl too!"

"I want to!"

"Haha! Let's all hug together!"

... Mei-chan is something else.

But is that really okay, being a princess of the Earlshide Kingdom?

In the face of her unrestrained behavior, even Ellie let out a sigh.

Her expression seemed to say that it was futile to say anything.

August was making the same face and sighing, while Agnes-san and Colin-kun wore wry smiles.

Amidst all the commotion caused by Mei-chan's entrance, the sound of footsteps running down the corridor could be heard again.

Appearing beyond the wide-open door was a breathless maid.

After catching her breath, she looked at me and broke into a broad smile.

"The baby has been born! It's a healthy baby boy, and both the mother and child are in good health!"

Immediately after those words resounded, the room was filled with loud cheers.orm names
