The other thief was a hunter from Karnan.

However, the place of issuance for the citizen's registration was the same as the other person, 'Darm Wurst.'

"This, even though our home countries are different, the place of registration issuance is the same..."

Mr. Orto seems to have noticed as well.

"Oh, finally caught the tail. Well done, Shin."

"Well, I just analyzed it, the real contributor is Masita, the one who made this citizen's card."

"Eh!? Masita, the legendary magical tool craftsman!?"

Mr. Orto is surprised by the information he hears for the first time, but now is not the time for that.

If you're interested, I'll explain it another day.

More importantly, now it's about what to do with this fact.

"What do we do? Should we go in right away?"

When I say that, Oug thinks for a moment and then shakes his head.

"No, it involves other countries, and various arrangements are necessary. We'll move after that."

Oug says so and smiles slyly.

"I've caught the tail. I've got the evidence. Now I'll take my time to cook it..."

To Oug, who laughs with a "Kukuku," both I and Mr. Orto are appalled.

"Uwa... Oug is becoming like a villain boss."

"Waldford-kun... that's a bit..."

Mr. Orto doesn't explicitly deny my words, probably because it would be disrespectful, but that means he thinks so.

"Shin, sorry, but I need your cooperation."

"Sure. I'm already involved. I can't just let it go."

"I see, that's right. Well then, first..."

On the spot, Oug and I discussed the future.

Mr. Orto was there too, but he seems to be a strong candidate for the next head of the security bureau, so he was present as there might be such occasions in the future.

Well, even though he occasionally looked distant during the conversation, he'll have to get used to such things in the future.

Having finished the discussion like this, we returned to the room where Sicily will stay today.

A few days after the baby was born, there were guests at the Walford house.

"Ahn, so cute! Hello, I'm Grandma."

It was Pope Ekaterina of the Church of the Creator.

"So... please stop that."

I already know it's futile.

Because...

"Grandma, isn't he cute?"

"Are you busy with work, Grandma?"

My children already recognize Ekaterina as their grandmother!

Every time she visits, she has been telling the kids that she is their grandma, and the result is thisâ€”calling the Supreme God Church Pope "Grandma."

As for how Natasha, the God's Oracle who came from East, feels about this... she fully approves. In fact, she's even trying to get herself called Natasha Aunt.

What's going on, Supreme God Church?

Is this okay? Supreme God Church?

By the way, the "Shon" Shal mentioned is the baby's name.

Shon Walford.

The second son of the Walford family.

His finally opened eyes are the same blue as Sicily's, making him even more resembling Sicily.

Seeing Shon, Ekaterina sighed, saying, "Nevertheless, I feel a sense of exclusion for not being able to attend Shon's birth."

If Ekaterina says something like that, Natasha also grimaces.

"I also... regret not going with you to the royal castle. If I had, the young master and the saint wouldn't have been exposed to danger, and I could have been present at the birth!"

Natasha seems genuinely frustrated.

As mentioned earlier, Natasha doesn't accompany Sicily and the others when they go to the royal castle.

It's easy to forget because she usually follows Sicily around, but she belongs to the East Holy Kingdom.

Moreover, she's a bishop.

Important figures from other countries can't just casually go to the royal castle.

Even if she doesn't feel that way, you never know what others might say.

In addition, although the situation was undermined this time, the security of the royal castle is normally flawless.

The knights and maids who got entangled with Shal and Via-chan originally are highly competent.

However, it seems that the knights and maids, feeling responsible for losing sight of Shal and Via-chan, have requested resignation.

Sicily and Ellie apologized, stating that the fault lay with their daughters and expressing regret for causing any trouble. Shal and Via also apologized, pleading for them not to resign, and somehow managed to persuade them to reconsider their resignations.

I also felt relieved since I wouldn't want people to lose their jobs because of my daughters' actions.

However, Oug didn't seem to share the same sentiment. It seemed he had the perspective that if you couldn't fulfill the given duties, it couldn't be helped. As a result, he lamented receiving a cold evaluation from Via, who described him as "cold."

Since that incident, it feels like Via's evaluation of Oug has become more critical. Well, Oug's stance may not be wrong as a ruler, but from a child's perspective, it might appear as a harsh judgment.

In order to appease Via, Oug has started bringing her to our house frequently. Originally, Via and Shal left Dis Uncle's office to protest against Oug and Dis Uncle frequently visiting our house. Given the origin of the issue and the fact that Via seems to dislike Oug, he can't refuse Via's requests.

So, today, Oug is also here, and naturally, Via is accompanying him.

"Shon, she's the big sister."

"Bia-chan, big sister is Sharu!"

"Someday, I'll be a big sister too."

"I don't get it!"

It's really hard to understand.

Does Via's "big sister" mean "sister-in-law"? She's definitely got her sights set on Silver. Is she really only three years old?

By the way, Max is not here today.

"Hehe, it's lovely to see the little ones gathered together."

Ekaterina watches Shal and the others, who are giggling around Shon, with an affectionate expression.

"However, it's unbelievable that there are those who would harm such cute children."

"Absolutely."

Ekaterina is aware of the incident that occurred at the royal castle.

This time, a gag order has been imposed on all countries regarding the incident that happened within the royal castle. The second attack within the royal castle is a significant scandal.

However, Ekaterina, who treats Silver and Shal as if they were her grandchildren, couldn't keep it a secret from her. Well, not only for that reason.

"So, Your Highness, what are your intentions from now on?"

Ekaterina says this and looks at Oug.

Her eyes eloquently convey, "Surely, you're not thinking of just catching the actual perpetrators and leaving it at that?"

Oug, who usually wields a strong hand within the Earlsheid royal castle, is visibly affected by the powerful gaze of Ekaterina, the Supreme God Church Pope and the National Head of State of the East Holy Kingdom.

"Well, actually, I have a request for Your Majesty regarding that."

"A request?"

"Yes. In the investigation of this incident, we have almost identified the mastermind. However, since it involves another country, we cannot casually intervene."

"I see."

"So, could the East Holy Kingdom intervene?"

"The East?"

"Yes. The mastermind this time is a representative from a regional city in the Darm Republic. However, as a high-ranking individual from another country, if we request an investigation or extradition, it could potentially spark a war."

When Oug says this, Ekaterina narrows her eyes.

"Does the East not mind if it leads to war?"

Well, that's the expected reaction. However, there is confidence that even if Earlsheid takes such action, it will be okay if it's the East.

"No, precisely because it's the East, it won't lead to war. Darm respects the East, the holy land of the Supreme God Church. Although, on a national level, they should be equal, Darm has always been obedient to the East. This time, we will exploit that Darm national characteristic."

After listening to Oug's explanation, Ekaterina seemed to be convinced.

"I see. Specifically?"

Ah, it seems she might cooperate.

"Darm is now no longer a functioning state. Due to the abrupt transition to a republic, there are distortions everywhere. It's no wonder if riots or revolutions happen anytime. Before it turns into such a bloody situation, we want you to take away Darm's sovereignty as a nation."

On that day, in that room, when I heard about it, I was surprised at how far they were willing to go.

However, Oug believes that Darm's current situation is ultimately the result of the way the country is being run. Since such issues didn't arise before, the idea is to restore things with the intervention of the East.

Even if they convict one regional legislator, as long as this system remains, Oug believes that the third and fourth incidents will occur. It's a complete act of invasion, but in order not to make it seem that way, they want to enlist the help of the East, specifically Ekaterina's power.

Ekaterina, who had been lost in thought for a while, eventually raised her head and looked at Oug.

"And then? Who will control Darm's sovereignty afterward?"

Ekaterina's smile is friendly, but it's also somewhat ominous.

Receiving that smile, Oug responds with a smile of his own.

"Of course, I would like to request the East's assistance."

Upon hearing these words, Ekaterina maintains her previous smile.

"I see. Understood. So, you're asking the East to help Darm with its national reconstruction."

"I apologize, but I hope for your understanding and cooperation."

Saying this, the two laugh together.

What is this feeling...

"...Watching you two, I can't really tell who the villain is."

Yeah, I feel the same way.

Nevertheless, the fate of the nation of Darm seems to have been decided not in the conference room of the castle but in the living room of this house.

Is this okay?

Well, looking at the reports, Darm seems on the verge of collapsing as a nation, so maybe it's a good opportunity.

Even in my past life, coming from a democratic country, I felt that this rush toward democratization this time was too hasty.

Even if there were to be democratization in the future, it would need to be accompanied by a significant change in public awareness. Moreover, democratization itself doesn't guarantee happiness for everyone.

In the current situation, there are countries like Earlsheid, where even under a monarchy, the populace can live prosperously.

Nevertheless, I wonder why Darm's Prime Minister, Hiiro-san, rushed democratization so much?

Being the hero of the War of the Demon King in Darm, he should have had popularity among the people.

If he was popular with the people, they should have listened to his words.

If they had taken their time, engaged in dialogue with the people, and deepened their understanding, perhaps things might have gone well.

Why did they rush? It's a mystery.

"What's wrong, Shin?"

"Shin, do you have any questions?"

They must have seen it on my face again; Oug and Ekaterina called out to me.

"Oh, no, I don't have any objections to the content of the conversation. It's just..."

"Just?"

"I'm just curious why Hiiro-san hurried things. I just thought I'd like to talk to him directly if possible."

"I see."

Well, this is just out of curiosity.

It's not like I really want to.

But...

"Oh, then, Shin, will you come with us when we go to Darm?"

Ekaterina proposed my participation as if we were going shopping together.

"Huh? Is it okay to be so casual about it?"

"It's fine. Because..."

Ekaterina smiled there.

"It's not strange for a son to accompany his mother, right?"

"I'm not your son, and you're not my mother. It's just weird!"

Why is this person so persistently trying to be my mother!?

And because of that, Shal started making a fuss, saying that I and Ekaterina were going somewhere together.

"It's unfair that only Dad and Grandma are going! Shal will go too!"

"Well..."

Shal, being proposed to go with Dad, is a scene that would undoubtedly create an extremely tense atmosphere, right?

It's not shopping, you know?

I desperately try to persuade her, but Shal isn't convinced.

In the end, I found myself going shopping with Shal, Ekaterina, and Silver.

During the journey, due to Shal's request for dessert and her calling Ekaterina "Granny," a misunderstanding spread throughout Earlsheid and, no, even the world.

It is said that I am Ekaterina's secret child.

And no matter how much I deny it, the misunderstanding doesn't disappear, finally settling among the people.

As a result, Grandma, who had feared this outcome, lost her temper, but the cause was Shal. Since I am in a socially influential position and am no longer being manipulated by those around me, Ekaterina's life was spared.

Well, in the first place, Shal started calling Ekaterina "Granny" due to the result of Ekaterina's influence, so I did receive some scolding from Grandma.

When I was forgiven, I cried tears of joy.

Pope...
