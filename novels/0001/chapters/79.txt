"Is it true that you've found demons?"

During a routine report from the Demon Territory on a day when we were successfully subduing monsters, Oug delivered a shocking report. We had been heading towards the old imperial capital, where the demons were likely to have their base, while defeating monsters along the way. However, according to the reconnaissance unit of the Kurt Allied Forces, they had discovered a city where the demons were gathering.

"Could it be a trap?"

"I went to confirm it myself. It's an abandoned city, and the demons were destroying buildings for fun. There's no way it's a trap."

Confirming it personally, huh? What a risky move.

"They haven't spotted you, have they?"

"Thanks to my magic control training. Not only can I increase my magical power, but I can also suppress it to a minimum. I also used magic to block magical detection, so they haven't noticed me at all."

"That's good then... So, did you find Strom?"

"It's impossible to search the entire city, of course... But I confirmed that there are around fifty sources of magical power throughout the city."

"If you keep moving, you won't be able to get an accurate count..."

"I'm sorry."

"It can't be helped. Just the fact that we know there's no ambush is a win..."

But still, why are they gathering in a city on the way instead of the imperial capital? And destroying buildings for fun... Are they frustrated by the failure of two previous attacks?

Are they really upset by such an amateurish attack?

It's strange that they're just frustrated and not launching the next attack.

"Something seems off..."

"Yeah, I feel the same way. For now, we've positioned the Kurt Allied Forces away from the city, where they can't be seen."

"Right. It's probably best to wait until we join them this time."

"They've already been ordered strictly. The demons are not to be engaged until you guys arrive."

Dealing with a couple of demons is one thing, but facing dozens of them is impossible without all of us being together.

"You'll receive a report from their camp soon. Hurry and gather here."

"Understood!"

It's the final stretch.

We've already missed them twice. Failure is not an option anymore. We have to surround them completely and ensure their annihilation!

And, as Oug mentioned, soldiers who had exchanged information with various allied forces returned and reported to the leadership, including Commander Ralph Portman of the Darm, Els, and Is commanders.

We three were also present.

"What did you say? You've found the demons' base?"

"Yes. It was confirmed by the Kurt Allied Forces' reconnaissance unit. They had multiple people confirm it, so there's no doubt."

"K-Kurt Allied Forces have Prince August, right? Wasn't there any attempt to subdue them?"

"Well, there are a large number of demons, so there's a possibility they might escape, and they are waiting for the Ultimate Magicians from various allied forces to gather before taking action."

"I see... so they haven't been subdued yet..."

Commander Portman let out a relieved sigh upon hearing that they hadn't been subdued yet.

Why is he relieved that they haven't been subdued?

"All right! In that case, our destination changes as well. Where is the location of this city?"

"It's right here."

A soldier pointed out the city's location on the map of the old empire. We've been marching into the Demon Territory for several days now. Since we are all heading to the same destination, our positions aren't too far apart. We should be able to join up in two to three days.

"The issue is the farthest Arlsheid Army. Since the Ultimate Magicians won't be accompanying them, there's a possibility they might engage in battle before our arrival."

Certainly, the Arlsheid Army is positioned the farthest away. However, originally, it was our responsibility to subdue the demons. Even though the Arlsheid Army has become capable of subduing Catastrophe-class demons, we don't want them to participate.

"We don't want the allied forces or the Arlsheid Army to get involved in the demon battle. We will handle it ourselves. So, there's probably going to be a battle before they arrive."

"...Are you saying that only you can subdue the demons?"

The way it's said may be prickly, but, well, that's the idea. Furthermore, each country's performance in demon subjugation over the past few days should be sufficient for this operation. Moreover, the capture operation won't be over with the demons gone. Once the demons are gone, the land will be divided among the various countries. With many people settling here, it's necessary to significantly thin out the monsters. After subduing the demons, we will move on to a monster sweep operation.

This time, nobody will complain if they don't participate in the demon subjugation.

"I'm not saying this out of arrogance, but judging from the situation in Swed, I don't think the armies of various countries can handle it. I... we have a track record of subduing demons in the past. In light of that, I heard that this operation was planned and approved. "

Upon saying that, Commander Portman made a resentful expression, muttered "Hmph! How arrogant," and left the tent.

"Um... Did I say something wrong?"

"No, you didn't do anything wrong. What was with that attitude? I don't like it."

"Is that really the attitude of a commander of a nation? Commander Portman used to be a person of integrity, right? It's embarrassing as fellow Creation Faith believers."

The commanders of Els and Is expressed their discomfort.

That's to be expected.

The allied forces' commander suddenly insulted me. It was so sudden, and I hadn't even thought that something like that would happen, so I couldn't react at all.

"I-I'm sorry! I apologize for the commander's rudeness!"

A Darm army officer who seemed to be the vice-commander hurriedly bowed.

"Why did you make a person like him a commander?"

"Well, he usually isn't like that!"

"I heard that too. So what was that earlier?"

In response to a question from the Is commander, the vice-commander of the Darm seemed at a loss for words. And then, when he finally opened his mouth...

"P-Probably... Subduing the demons, even just one of them, is a great achievement. It's probably frustrating that the Ultimate Magicians will monopolize it..."

...What the heck.

So, is that the reason why he was relieved that the demons hadn't been subdued?

But it's hard to think of any other reason for him to hurl insults at us.

Perhaps the subordinate was debating whether or not to say something?

"What are you thinking in the face of a world crisis?"

"Indeed... It's truly lamentable."

Els and Is are on my side, it seems.

Amidst the commander's hidden ambitions, the Darm Allied Forces had changed their route to the old imperial capital and arrived near the city where the demons were gathering, where the Kurt Allied Forces had set up their camp.

The location they had reached was a hilly area, close to the city but out of sight.

"Long time no see, Shin."

"I hear your voice every day, so it doesn't feel like a long time at all."

After several days, we reunited with Oug and the others. Tony and the rest had already arrived. The only ones left were Alice and the Swede group.

"Freid's group arrived yesterday, Shin's group today. Probably, Corne's group will join tomorrow. Taking a day of rest to recover from the travel fatigue, we'll proceed with the attack afterward."

"By the way, are we going to offer them a surrender request?"

"...In my mind, demons are treated like monsters, regardless of whether they have free will, so I hadn't considered it. Is it necessary?"

What do you think?

Should I ask people from other countries?

"Not necessary! They are the enemies of humanity! A threat! They can't be left to roam freely!"

Els says there's no need for a surrender request.

"I don't think we need it, either. After all, they're the ones who ambushed the Kingdom of Swed and committed indiscriminate murder. Whether they're demons or not, that's the primary issue."

Els also says no surrender request is needed.

People from neighboring countries had the same opinion. They considered them enemies of humanity and a group of criminals who had already committed indiscriminate murder. Well, I thought the same, but without a written record, some might question why we didn't make a surrender request. Even though they're demons, they were once human, so a surrender request should have been made.

Now, before the Swede Allied Forces arrive, the rough outline of the plan has been decided.

The twelve of us will surround the city, forming a blockade. Using radio communication, we'll simultaneously bombard the city with magic. After the bombardment, we'll gradually narrow the siege while driving the demons toward the center of the city, where we will eliminate them.

It's quite a rough plan, but there are only twelve of us, so it should do. As for the allied forces, they'll encircle the outskirts of the city. In case any demons manage to escape, they will ensure the demons are not allowed to flee.

It means putting their lives on the line, but the soldiers of the allied forces were burning with determination.

As for the Arlsheid Army...

"Ideally, it would have been preferable for all the countries to be present. But if our country's army waits, the demons might become suspicious."

Prioritizing practicality over the face of the nation. That's what I expected from Oug.

"Furthermore, thinning out the number of monsters in the Demon Territory is also an important part of the operation. They'll be redirected there."

Since the Arlsheid Army, who might not make it in time for the demon subjugation operation, would continue to focus on subduing the monsters in the Demon Territory. Once the operation plan was finalized, it was time for rest until the Swede forces arrived.

Orders were given for those who had been in continuous combat to take it easy. As various allied forces joined and built relationships, someone appeared before us.

"Hey. Long time no see, Shin."

"Oh, Garan-san. It's been a while."

"You're really something, aren't you? Not just famous but a world hero."

"Well, it's just people around making a fuss. It's not that big of a deal."

"Being too humble can sound like sarcasm, you know. Be careful."

"Uh... sorry."

"Seriously, both you and the Demon Swordsman are amazing young folks nowadays."

Demon Swordsman?

"Who is it? The Demon Swordsman?"

"Huh? It's Tony from your place. A swordsman who can use magic. Seems like he's quite integrated into the Carunan Allied Forces, right?"

"I see."

Tony, you've been keeping secrets, haven't you? I'll have to tease him about it later.

"Even so, you don't seem nervous at all. Quite relaxed."

"Yeah. Demons themselves are not that big of a deal. I'm only worried about not letting them escape this time."

"Demons not being a big deal..."

In reality, that's true. After letting them escape twice, the only concern is not letting them get away this time.

"You're reliable. So, I'll leave it to you, Hero."

"Yes. Leave it to me."

Saying that, Garan-san returned to the Carunan camp.

Since we joined up, we've been moving together. Our camping arrangements changed from tents to large tents. We took out the beds stored in an extradimensional space and set them up.

"Beds for a camping trip... It's quite out of place."

"I have them for everyone, but Oug said he doesn't need one."

"To get a good rest, a bed is still the best."

He's quick to adapt. Well, sufficient rest is absolutely necessary before the final showdown with the demons.

I won't be mean and not give a bed to Oug.

"By the way, bringing beds with you... You've been developing soundproof magic tools, and I wonder what you've been doing during the camping."

"I haven't been doing anything!"

"Is that so?"

"Really?"

"What about Mark and Olivia's place? You guys are a couple too, right?"

"We wouldn't do something so inappropriate."

"Me neither!"

It's been a while since I had this kind of exchange.

Being with Cecily is, of course, great, but having male friends you can be at ease with is also a good thing.

We also set up beds in the women's tent.

They seemed very pleased, probably because they couldn't rest well.

"Shin, this bedding..."

"Yeah, it's the one we use at home."

"Wow, I'm so happy!"

Cecily smiled happily. She said it reminded her of her grandmother's bed.

"Is that the one with that thing? The one without wool?"

"Yeah, that's it."

"I see."

Maria doesn't seem completely convinced.

Once you sleep on it, you'll be hooked.

After finishing dinner and taking a bath, everyone must have been really tired because they went to sleep immediately without much idle chitchat.

The next morning, when we woke up, Oug begged me to let him have this bedding.

"I don't remember anything after getting into the bed. It felt like I was being enveloped, and when I realized, it was morning. I feel fully rested. This is amazing."

Oh, he's giving it high praise. By the way, it wasn't just Oug; everyone made the same request.

What should I do? If it's so popular, should I consider adding it to the company's product lineup? Oh, but that might infringe on the rights of existing stores. Maybe I should sell the idea to a workshop that deals with such bedding? Well, all of this can wait until this matter is settled.

While I was thinking about these things, in the early afternoon, part of the Swede Allied Forces joined us.

"Ah... so tired..."

"We're beat."

"I want to take a bath."

They seem pretty exhausted.

I heard that, in order to arrive as soon as possible, Alice and her group had been on an exhausting forced march since morning, even separating from the personnel responsible for subjugating monsters.

Seeing how tired Alice and her group were, I let them have a meal, take a bath, and rest on those beds I had brought along. When they woke up in the evening, they asked me to let them have the bedding, too.

Anyway, the Ultimate Magicians were finally assembled.

According to the reconnaissance reports, it seemed the demons had not made any moves, so after taking a day of rest tomorrow for Alice and her group, it would be time for the final battle.

The fate of the world rests on us.

From here on, it's all business, no more fooling around.

"Sleeping during the day, I can't sleep at night. Let's all chat, everyone!"

No more fooling around!

Tomorrow, after a day of rest, we will finally face the final battle with the demons.

The Allied Forces may not directly confront the demons, but if, by any chance, Shin and his group miss one, they will have to stop the demons at all costs.

Whether they like it or not, the mood for the final battle was rising.

In the meantime, inside Darm's tent, a group of people had gathered.

"General Portman, time is running out. The day after tomorrow, those Ultimate Magicians will start their demon subjugation."

"We don't recognize their titles, but their abilities are genuine. If we continue this way, they will take all the credit for the demon subjugation, and they won't even consider our request to revoke their titles!"

"I understand! Don't rush me!"

The camp of Ralph Portman, the commander of the Darm Kingdom, was filled with a group opposing the messengers of God and the Holy Maiden.

Originally, it was designed to accommodate a considerable number of people for military discussions and such, but around fifty people, close to its capacity, had gathered.

They had almost given up on the idea of taking away their titles by seeing Shin's strength up close. However, a golden opportunity suddenly presented itself.

The demons were right in front of them, and they hadn't noticed us.

If they managed to subjugate the demons before Shin and his group did, it would be the perfect opportunity to prove that they didn't need to rely on them to save the world, making titles like messengers of God unnecessary.

Ralph reassured the anxious soldiers in the face of such a golden opportunity.

Listen up. Even if we try to get closer to that city right now, we'll undoubtedly be spotted by someone. However, tomorrow night... everyone will likely rest early to prepare for the next day's major operation. In other words, there will be fewer people around. We should wait until then.

We still have some time left because of the days we have. Even at night, there may be people around. So, Ralph convinced everyone to wait until tomorrow night.

Their eyes showed that something was amiss.

The situation was like a dream come true for them.

God had created this opportunity for us.

God was on our side, more so than the ones called messengers of God.

Maybe they shouldn't even be called messengers of God.

We will prove that.

God is telling us to defeat the demons.

They understood the situation this way.

And for the sake of that interpretation, they had come to believe that they were the ones recognized by God.

Fanaticism.

That's exactly what was in their minds.

However, their thoughts, overwhelmed by fanatic thinking, missed something.

The method to defeat the demons.

"General Portman, so... What is the specific way to subdue them?"

Not everyone present was in a fanatical state of mind.

There were several soldiers who made rational judgments.

"Well, based on their past actions, there's a high chance that they're just a disorganized group. If we subdue them under the cover of darkness, we can do it without any problems!"

"But... the rumors say they're stronger than disaster-class demons..."

"Hmph! Those might just be rumors they're spreading on their own to keep us from interfering with their achievements! Most likely, they're saying that to prevent us from getting involved."

Is that really the case? The soldier who made the suggestion tilted his head. Indeed, Darm and Carnan had not directly encountered the demons.

They had not actually seen how strong they were.

"As evidence, look at this. In the Kurt Kingdom, there have been no human casualties."

"But in the Swede Kingdom..."

"Most likely, they couldn't respond to the surprise attack. At that time, the demons were easily driven away, right? They're really not a big deal, these demons."

Before the three-country meeting, there was a growing sentiment that "demons are not a big deal," something Shin and the others had been concerned about, and it seemed to be having an impact even here.

"But..."

Please let me know if you need further assistance.

"Enough! You've been nothing but negative from earlier! Do you intend to defy the teachings of the Creation God's religion?"

The teachings of the Creation God's religion.

When did this discussion turn in that direction? Wasn't this gathering initially meant to be a congregation of people who were not pleased with Shin and the others being called messengers of God or holy women and were considering means to revoke their titles?

They wanted to achieve more significant accomplishments than Shin and the others. Starting from the point where they convinced themselves that God had prepared the way for them, their thoughts were heading in a dangerous direction.

This is bad.

The content of this operation, with Shin and the others subduing the demons and the rest of the armies dealing with monsters, was decided at the World Union Ministerial Conference.

If these fanatical thinkers take action here, it won't be about them stealing Shin and the others' credit. It would put Darm in an extremely disadvantageous position.

Trying to persuade them directly was difficult due to their clouded fanaticism. They had tried to convince Ralph by explaining that there was no way to subdue the demons, but it failed.

They had to stop them no matter what.

Some of the people present had determined that they should not let these fanatics go to the city where the demons were gathering.

The day after Alice and the others, the Swede Allied Forces, joined, was a complete day off.

To conserve their strength for the final battle scheduled for the following day, they avoided any activities that might leave them fatigued, and there was no training whatsoever.

The only ones working were the joint reconnaissance teams from various countries and non-combatants responsible for managing meals and tent accommodations.

The operation the next day would be a surprise attack under the cover of darkness just before dawn.

Because they needed to wake up in the middle of the night for that, except for the night watchmen, everyone was told to go to bed early, and they all went to sleep in the beds prepared the previous day.

They were awakened by shouts a little before their planned waking time in the middle of the night.

"The demons are moving! The demons have started to move!"
