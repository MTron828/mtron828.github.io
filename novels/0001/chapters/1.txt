Cold...

Pain...

Suffering...

Those were the feelings I had when I realized.

I try to trace back the memories before my consciousness awakened, but it's not clear. I finished work and was on my way home...

Wait a minute. I don't remember arriving home.

I don't remember drinking either. In fact, I didn't have plans to dine out. So, could it be that I was in an accident or something?

I attempt to consider various possibilities, but my thoughts don't come together in this excruciating state.

I try to move my body, but it doesn't respond well.

I try to open my eyes, but for some reason, it doesn't work either.

This is getting really bad. I try to speak, but...

"Ah!"

I'm startled by the sound I just made.

It's a high-pitched voice, almost like that of a baby.

I try to speak, but it comes out as "aah aah aah."

My tongue doesn't cooperate, and I can't speak. I try until I suddenly lose control of my emotions and start crying.

It's embarrassing for an adult, but I can't help it.

What's going on?

As I cry for a while, I hear footsteps.

I thought it was cold, and it seemed like it was raining since I heard the sound of footsteps splashing.

(Thank goodness.)

That thought doesn't last long. I hear a voice.

"☆※◇◎□○△▽"

I can't understand it at all.

I'm about to fall into even more confusion, but suddenly, I'm enveloped in warm light, and the pain I felt until just now disappears, replaced by the comfort of warm fabric.

Feeling reassured by this, I lose consciousness.
