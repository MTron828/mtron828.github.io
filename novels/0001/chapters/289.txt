"Arlside Elementary School's weekend break.

Allen, who arrived at the Walford family's house in his family's carriage, was secretly impressed.

The Walford family, located within the Arlside capital, is one of the most important establishments in the capital, housing Sage Merlin, Instructor Merida, Demon Lord Shin, and Saint Cecily.

The entrance to their estate is always under strict guard, and people can only see the house from a distance. Only a very limited few are allowed to pass through the gate.

And now, the carriage passed through that gate.

"Wow... We passed through the Walford family's gate!"

"Father..."

Allen cast a sidelong glance at his father, who was even more impressed than he was. He couldn't fully immerse himself in his own excitement because his father was making such a big fuss.

"I told you it's fine for just me. Why did you come along?"

"W-well, you see, even though it's a children's interaction, it's our first time visiting their home. So, as a parent, I thought we should start with greetings, right?"

When he put it that way, it made sense.

Allen was the son of a duke, belonging to one of the highest-ranking noble families. The Walford family, while technically not holding a title, was in the position of commoners due to various adult circumstances. If the Arlside royal family wanted, and if the Walfords were willing, it wouldn't be surprising for the status of a duke to be conferred, especially considering the closeness to the royal family. If a child from such a family were going to play, it was only natural for the head of the family to pay a visit.

However...

"Father, I can't help but wonder... You didn't come along just because you wanted to meet Lord Shin, Cecily, Merlin, or Merida, did you?"

"Wh-why would I do that? I... I'm here strictly as a representative of the Welstein Duke's family!"

It seems that his father's goal was indeed to meet the people of the Walford family. No wonder he had seemed unusually cheerful since yesterday. Allen let out a sigh as he watched his father, who was displaying none of his usual sternness.

And so, the Welstein family's carriage, followed by the Manuel Earl's carriage, arrived at the front entrance of the mansion."

With Silver's guidance, the children made their way to the living room, and the adults, who were their guardians, also entered.

And there, they saw someone who left them stunned.

"Hello, welcome."

"You've come well."

It was Merlin and Merida.

For Allen and Cresta's generation, the heroes were Shin, Cecily, and the Ultimate Magicians like August. But for their parents, the heroes were these two.

Living legends were right in front of them.

"It's a pleasure to meet you for the first time! I am Albert von Welstein, representing the Welstein Duke! It's an honor to meet you!"

"I am Chester von Manuel, representing the Manuel Earl! I'm deeply moved to have this opportunity!"

When they met Shin and Cecily, they were nervous about meeting modern heroes. However, Merlin and Merida had been their idols since childhood.

Meeting these two had the Welstein Duke and Manuel Earl just as moved as Allen and Cresta earlier. Their expressions mirrored that of children.

"Haha. Well, don't be too nervous."

"Listen to the old man. Those kids will be visiting us in the future, right? Relax and be more casual."

"Yes, yes!"

They were having a conversation with heroes they had known only from tales.

Just that fact made them feel elated.

The living room was for the children, so the adults began their exchange at the dining table between the Walford family, Welstein Duke's family, and Manuel Earl's family.

Meanwhile, in the living room, the children...

"Wow... We were addressed by the Demon Lord..."

"The Saint... she was so beautiful..."

Allen and Cresta sat side by side on the sofa, reminiscing about their encounter with Shin and Cecily. Seeing the dreamy expressions on their faces, Silver couldn't help but chuckle.

"Is it that impressive?"

Upon hearing these words, Allen and Cresta vehemently protested.

"You fool! They're the Demon Lord and the Saint! They're modern heroes, living legends!"

"Why are you so composed instead?"

As the two of them leaned forward and put their hands on the coffee table, Sylvester involuntarily took a step back.

"Why, you ask..."

For Sylvester, Shin and Cecily were neither more nor less than his parents. But Allen and Cresta, who couldn't comprehend that feeling, looked at Sylvester with disbelief in their eyes.

"Haven't you two ever heard their heroic tales?"

"Well, I've read them in picture books and children's stories."

Shin's story had been adapted into various forms for children, including the well-known "Sequel to the Heroic Tale," picture books, children's stories, and even plays that Shin had hoped to prevent.

However...

"I haven't read them."

When Sylvester said that, Allen and Cresta looked at him in disbelief.

Allen and Cresta, or rather children all over the world, grew up listening to the stories of Shin and the others through picture books. Boys were thrilled by the repeated battles with demons, and girls admired the romantic tale of Shin and Cecily.

The current generation of children loved their stories. Yet Sylvester, the child of their admired heroes Shin and Cecily, hadn't even read their stories. This fact was unbelievable.

"Why not?"

"Well, my dad is embarrassed about it and doesn't show me the books."

"Embarrassed..."

What was an exciting story for Allen and Cresta was nothing more than an embarrassing tale to the person involved. However, young Allen and Cresta couldn't grasp that concept.

"Well, I don't know about that story, but I do know that my parents are amazing. My dad often takes me on walks in the sky."

While Allen and Cresta were still confused by Sylvester's inability to understand Shin's perspective, his words dispelled their confusion.

"What's a sky walk!?"

"P-please tell us more!"

Intrigued by Sylvester's unfamiliar and enticing words, Allen and Cresta eagerly pressed him for more information.

"Well, you see..."

As Sylvester started to speak about it, the excitement of the two children made him lean back, and he began to explain the details.

As they chatted and enjoyed tea and snacks, Sylvester suddenly turned his gaze as if he had noticed something.

"Hmm? What's wrong, Silver?"

"Silver-kun?"

"Oh, well..."

Seeing Sylvester's somewhat troubled expression, the two became curious and looked in the direction of his gaze.

There, they saw...

"Jiiii..."

Four young faces were staring intently at them from the entrance of the living room.

"What's that over there?"

"Oh, uh... my little sister and her friends."

Allen's murmured response was met with Sylvester's explanation.

Indeed, those staring at them were Silver's younger sisters. They looked enviously at their brother talking to unknown children.

"They're... cute."

The sight of younger children looking at them cutely charmed Cresta, and she couldn't help but exclaim.

Wanting to interact with the young children, Cresta called out to the four.

"Would you like to come here?"

Charlotte was the first to respond. She dashed from the entrance of the living room and pounced onto Sylvester without saying a word.

"Whoa!"

"Charlotte! That's not fair!!"

Following Charlotte, Octavia also leaped onto Sylvester.

Max and Rain, somewhat timidly, entered the room after the two young girls attached themselves to Sylvester.

"Hi there."

"Uhm... hi."

Seeing Max and Rain cautiously offering greetings, Allen chuckled.

"Hey! I'm Allen. Nice to meet you!"

Since Max and Rain were younger, Allen acted all big-brotherly as he made this greeting.

Smiling at Allen's greeting, Cresta also introduced herself.

"I'm Cresta. Nice to meet you, Max and Rain."

Max and Rain blushed and looked down upon receiving such an introduction from the fragile beauty that was Cresta.

"Yeah, nice to meet you."

"Nice to meet you too."

Seeing their reactions, Cresta couldn't help but feel a bit fluttery inside.

"Come on, you two, say hi as well."

Sylvester urged the little girls attached to him to offer greetings properly. Charlotte looked at Allen and Cresta with a slightly sulky expression.

"...I'm Charlotte."

Allen and Cresta quickly understood that Charlotte's sulky greeting stemmed from jealousy, as she saw her beloved older brother having fun with someone she didn't know.

On the other hand, Octavia, after momentarily separating from Sylvester, gave a small curtsey while holding her skirt.

"I'm Octavia."

As soon as she introduced herself, Allen and Cresta froze.

In the Wolfram family's home, there was only one person who could match Octavia's name. The two of them immediately stood up from the sofa, with Allen placing his hand over his chest and kneeling, while Cresta, more sophisticated than Octavia but still somewhat unsteady, executed a curtsy.

"Nice to meet you, Your Highness Octavia! I am Allen, the eldest son of the Welshstein Duke!"

"Nice to meet you, Your Highness Octavia. I am Cresta, the second daughter of the Manuel Count!"

Coming over to a friend's house and encountering a member of the royal family was an unbelievable event. In a state of panic, they continued to bow frantically.

After a while of not being addressed, Allen and Cresta became concerned and carefully looked at Octavia. Octavia was looking at them with a bewildered expression.

Allen and Cresta understood that Octavia seemed to be unsure of how to address them, and they couldn't simply dispense with the formalities in front of a royal like Octavia. An awkward silence hung in the air.

Seeing this, Sylvester smiled wryly and whispered something to Octavia. Octavia, blushing slightly, was fidgeting in her seat but soon turned to face Allen and Cresta.

"Please raise your heads."

At long last, the words emerged from Octavia, and Allen and Cresta, relieved, lifted their heads.

"Allen, Cresta, Vi-chan is only three years old and hasn't received formal etiquette training yet. So, I think you don't need to be so formal."

Although Allen and Cresta wanted to shout that there was no way they could do that, when they looked at the still bewildered Octavia, who was only three years old, they agreed that it would be challenging to expect a three-year-old to understand such things, even if she was of royal blood.

Nevertheless, they knew they should maintain a basic level of politeness.

While they were sitting on the sofa, Allen and Cresta suddenly noticed Octavia staring at Cresta.

"Uh... Your Highness, is there something wrong?" Cresta asked. "Have I done something inappropriate?"

They wondered if perhaps they weren't supposed to sit on the sofa. They began to rise from their seats, but Octavia's words stopped them.

"Who are you, to Silver Oniisama?"

Those words sent a shiver down Cresta's spine. She didn't immediately understand Octavia's words, but seeing Octavia glaring at them while clinging to Sylvester's arm made it clear that Octavia was being cautious.

She's wary! A three-year-old is being cautious of a woman approaching Sylvester!

Cresta couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy at Octavia's incredibly cute jealousy.

However, she concealed her feelings, and with a gentle expression and tone, she replied to Octavia.

"Sylvester-kun is just a friend."

"...Is that true?"

Still skeptical, Octavia looked at them. Cresta tried to reassure her with more words.

"Yes, it's true. And, besides..."

Cresta paused for a moment and glanced at Allen. Then she stood up from the sofa, approached Octavia, and whispered in her ear.

"There's someone else I like."

When Octavia heard those words, she had noticed Cresta looking at Allen earlier, so she deduced who that might be.

"I understand."

Octavia smiled, and Cresta breathed a sigh of relief. To be considered a romantic rival by their country's princess would be a dire situation, but Cresta had managed to avoid that outcome.

However, it was short-lived.

"Okay, then play with us!"

"Huh?"

Although the meaning of "jaan" was unclear, the princess suddenly ordered them to play with her.

"It's not fair for Silver Oniisama to have you all to himself! We want to play too!"

When Octavia said that, Charlotte, Max, and Rain also looked at Allen and Cresta with intense interest.

"Well, alright..."

"If that's what you want..."

It seemed these children really liked Sylvester.

Sylvester was being monopolized by Allen and Cresta, which is why the children came to check on him.

"Um... Allen, Cresta, I'm sorry, but can you play with these children?" Sylvester, with Charlotte on his left arm and Octavia on his right, said with a wry smile. Allen and Cresta were quite perplexed.

"Eh... with the princess...?"

"Together...?"

As they wondered what to do, they heard an adult woman's voice.

"Would you mind playing with them?"

When Allen and Cresta turned around in response to that sudden voice, they saw an elegant woman, dressed simply yet radiating nobility.

Seeing her, Allen and Cresta hastily stood up and performed the courtesy they had shown to Octavia earlier.

"Please, lift your heads and relax. This isn't the royal castle, and I'm only here as Via's mother," the woman said.

Earlier, when Allen's and Cresta's father, who was a member of the Waldford family, had greeted her, she had not shown her face. But with Octavia present, it was only natural that her mother, Elizabeth, would be there too.

And it wasn't just Elizabeth.

"I'm sorry, Silver-chan. It seems that everyone is curious about your friends," said Olivia, who was Max's mother, looking troubled.

"Rain, too, thought he was being well-behaved, but apparently he was curious," added Christina, Rain's mother.

It was unusual for Rain, who didn't often express his emotions outwardly, to be concerned about Silver's friends.

"I'm sorry, Allen-kun, Cresta-san. We've caused an interruption, even though you came to play," Silvia said.

When the adults finished their conversation, Silvia, who had been present all along, spoke up.

"Oh, no! It's not a problem at all..."

"Um... may we play with the princess, then?"

The reason for Allen and Cresta's confusion wasn't because they felt their interaction with Silver was being disrupted, but rather, they weren't sure if it would be appropriate to play with members of the royal family.

As Allen and Cresta hesitated, Elizabeth smiled warmly.

"It's not a problem at all. In fact, it would be greatly appreciated if you could keep the children company. May we ask for your help?"

If asked by Elizabeth, a former duke's daughter and the current Crown Princess, there was only one response for Allen and Cresta.

"Yes, of course!"

Watching this scene from a distance, Shin couldn't help but think, "Is this a tavern?" as he mentally commented on the enthusiasm with which the two accepted Elizabeth's request.

Afterward, Sylvester and the others moved to the garden.

They became engrossed in games like tag, hide-and-seek, and playing with a ball. Max and Rain tackled Sylvester, who would gently catch and toss them, eliciting peals of laughter from the two children. Seeing this, Charlotte and Octavia approached Sylvester, rolling with laughter after being playfully knocked over. Octavia even clung to Sylvester and wouldn't let go.

Watching this, Allen and Cresta nervously anticipated what would happen. They ended up being tackled by Max and Rain while distracted, both of them falling over. They played to their heart's content as long as their energy allowed.

Gradually, as their stamina waned, Charlotte, lying on the grass, fell asleep and was soon followed by the other children. Octavia cheekily fell asleep while clinging to Sylvester's arm. When the children's seemingly endless energy was finally depleted, Allen and Cresta breathed a sigh of relief.

"It's fine, you two. Sorry to have kept you playing with these kids," Sylvester apologized, looking a bit out of breath.

"No, it's alright... But are you sure about this?" Allen asked.

Allen was concerned because Sylvester was sitting on the grass, still holding Octavia in his arms. It seemed that six-year-old Sylvester couldn't stand up while holding three-year-old Octavia, so they were in this position. They worried whether it was disrespectful to hold Princess Octavia in this manner.

"Huh? What do you mean?" Sylvester looked genuinely puzzled.

Sighing in resignation, Allen remembered the situation.

"Right... this is the Waldford house."

"C-Cresta, what should we do...? Should we call our moms?"

"Uh, you want me to...? I can't move right now."

Sylvester's words meant that he wanted their mothers to be called to pick up these sleeping children.

In other words, it was a request for the saint and the Crown Princess herself to be summoned.

Allen couldn't help but exclaim at this huge task. However, seeing Sylvester's usual calm demeanor, he sighed again.

"Alright."

"I'm sorry."

"Hey, Allen, I'll go with you."

"Yeah, that would be helpful."

It was less mentally taxing to go together than alone.

Relieved by Cresta's suggestion, Allen expressed his gratitude and they headed towards the mothers.

"Phew, this is tiring..."

"Yeah, it is."

"That boy Max, he's from the Bean Workshop, right?"

"That's right. And isn't Rain the son of the future Magic Brigade Commander?"

"And on top of that..."

"The Princess..."

After Cresta made her statement, both of them fell silent for a while before heaving a collective sigh.

"The Waldford house is truly a terrifying place."

"It wasn't as easygoing as we thought..."

Their excitement about visiting the famous Earlsheid house was completely gone. Instead, they had developed a perception that the Waldford house was a formidable place.

They decided not to casually visit in the future. With this determination, Allen and Cresta went to find the mothers.

As a result, the visit to the Waldford family home came to an end. However, as they were leaving, they heard words they couldn't believe.

"Allen, Cresta, please come and visit us again."

"It seems that Via has grown quite fond of you, so please, we insist."

The saint and the Crown Princess were asking them to come again. With this request, the two nobles of the Earlsheid Kingdom had no choice but to respond.

"Yes, of course."

"Understood."

Their pledge to avoid further visits to the Waldford house was immediately dismissed.

"Will we have to go through such a stomach-churning experience again...?"

While Allen and Cresta were riding in a carriage on their way home, deeply immersed in despair, their parents, sitting beside them, had the opportunity to engage in lively conversation as if they were discussing legendary heroes. They wore delighted expressions on their faces.orm names
