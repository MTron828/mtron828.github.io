After the interrogation at the Imperial Palace, Hao was returned to his home while still restrained.

Though his restraints were removed, his home was closely monitored by numerous soldiers, making it impossible for him to escape.

In this situation, Hao sat in his room, feeling overwhelmed.

How did things end up like this? He was so close to gaining control of the dragon leather trade and enjoying the wealth that would come with it. He had taken some risks, but he believed he could handle them.

However, his trusted adjutant, whom he believed to be loyal, and his private guards, who were supposed to protect him, had betrayed him.

Now, he found himself in this dire situation. If things continued this way, he might not only lose his political position but also be branded a criminal.

Hao was convinced that it was all the fault of the commoners who had betrayed him. He had indeed falsified reports and submitted bills that harmed the citizens.

The evidence was against him, and his political career was finished. Additionally, he was implicated in criminal activities due to his threats to the staff of the organization that was researching the dragon population.

It was not a matter of "might" but a fact that his downfall had already been sealed.

Yet, Hao had a strong sense of being chosen. He believed he stood at the pinnacle of the nation, looking down on even the emperor as a mere figurehead.

Someone like him couldn't possibly accept his current predicament. He earnestly believed that this was all part of a conspiracy to discredit him.

Such unjust treatment should not be allowed. He needed to find a way to regain his position.

If he could demonstrate his power, the foolish citizens would surely recognize that the nation still needed him. But how could he showcase his power?

That's when Hao thought of that weapon. That weapon had displayed tremendous power. During the activation test, it effortlessly pierced the target, shattered people in the distant line of sight, and even removed part of a mountain beyond.

With that weapon, he believed he could not only escape his current predicament but also overthrow the emperor and become the emperor himself.

Such was the extent of its power.
