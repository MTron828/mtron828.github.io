"Ekaterina was stabbed!? What in the world is happening?"

The emergency message from Uncle Dis was about Ekaterina being stabbed.

"I don't know the details of why it happened. Her injuries from the stabbing are being treated with healing magic, but..."

Uncle Dis paused for a moment.

"What? Was there a problem?"

"It appears that the blade was coated with poison."

"Poison!?"

"Yes. No matter how much healing magic is applied, she seems to be deteriorating. So, Shin-kun, they reached out to you for help."

Darn it! How could this happen? Can't Is, a healing magic user, treat poison?

"Understood! I'll head there immediately; please inform them on their side!"

"Very well. I'm counting on you. If Carce has been harmed, it will lead to more chaos. We must do everything we can to prevent that."

We were just talking about the mission coming to an end after Ekaterina's declaration, and now this. I don't know who would do such a thing or for what reason, but if the Pope of the Church of Creation with followers around the world has been killed, even if the demon situation is under control, peace won't be easily achieved.

We absolutely have to avoid that.

I should have given her that necklace!

I regret not giving it to her.

"Grandpa!"

"Yes, I heard the conversation. We're heading to Is!"

"Please! Oug, I'm going!"

"Shin! Save Pope Neiha no matter what!"

"I understand!"

We headed to Is through the gate that Grandpa opened.

When we emerged from the gate, we found ourselves in an elegant private room.

Grandpa, exiting through the gate, promptly opened the door of the room.

"Hey! Who are you? Coming out of Pope Neiha's room!"

Oh, so this is Ekaterina's private room.

A person who appeared to be one of her guards, hustling near the door, questioned Grandpa as he came out of Ekaterina's room.

Well, it's only natural to be surprised when someone suddenly exits the Pope's room.

"I am Merlin Wolphord! This is my grandson, Shin! We have come to assist with Ekaterina's treatment at the request of King Deseum of Arlsheid. Now, guide us immediately!"

"W-What? The Sage, you say? This transparent lie..."

"Stop babbling! Stop talking nonsense and guide us now!"

Whoa! Grandpa lost his temper.

An incredibly dense magical power swirled around Grandpa.

The knight guarding the entrance was trembling on his feet, observing this display.

"Don't dawdle! If we don't make it in time, and if Ekaterina dies... I will tear you apart!"

"Y-Yes, but it's not as simple as taking an unknown person inside..."

I've never seen Grandpa so frightening. He's getting seriously impatient with the knight who won't guide us.

However, it's understandable from the knight's point of view. This is Dis's request, but there's no way to prove it. He was asked to convey the message, but wasn't told where to open the gate, for example.

What should we do?

We have to treat her quickly, or it might be too late.

While I was trying to think of a way to get through this, a priestess in a magnificent robe rushed over.

Oh, that's her!

"Hey! Shin-dono, you haven't arrived yet... Oh! Shin-dono!"

"Long time no see, Makina-san!"

"What? Archbishop Makina? So you really are the Sage and his messenger?"

Makina-san, who knows my face and had participated in the Three Nations Summit, came to welcome us.

"You came right away, didn't you!"

"Of course! Straight to Pope Neiha!"

"Right this way!"

We followed Archbishop Makina, running as she led the way. The knight came along with us, looking pitifully pale.

"I can't believe they really were the Sage and his messenger... What have I done..."

He mumbled to himself while following us, but it wasn't the time to entertain the knight.

"Makina-san, how is Pope Neiha's condition?"

"Heh... heh... Huh? Ah, the stab wound is quite deep, and she's lost a significant amount of blood. Heh... heh... Even if the wound heals..."

She seemed to be out of breath, unable to speak further, or perhaps she couldn't find the words for the dire situation.

I couldn't say anything more either, I just followed Makina-san.

And we arrived at the Audience Chamber.

When the Supreme Pontiff of the Creation Church, who is also the head of state, receives envoys from other countries, it is in the Audience Chamber that he welcomes them.

"In the Audience Chamber... That means the culprit is..."

"Haa! Haa! Y-Yes... a foreigner... an envoy from Dam."

As expected, the person was a foreigner.

Makina-san, who was completely out of breath, strained her last bit of strength to open the door to the Audience Chamber.

"Shin-dono! Please, save Pope Neiha!"

"Yes! Please step aside! I will take over the treatment!"

With Makina-san, who had opened the door but was now on the floor, urging us on, I ran towards the people gathered in the Audience Chamber.

"Oh! The envoy! The envoy has arrived!"

"Envoy! Please, save Neiha, the Pope!"

When Makina-san shouted my name loudly, everyone seemed to recognize who I was.

People kept calling out to me one after another, but I didn't have time to respond.

The crowd parted, revealing the scene: Ekaterina lying in a pool of blood, a healer using restorative magic desperately trying to treat her, and...

"Fufufu! I'm not the bad one! It's the Pope who certified that brat as God's envoy who's at fault!"

The man, who appeared to be the perpetrator, was being held down by knights and was uttering strange sounds.

"Silence! You traitor!"

"For an envoy from a vassal state to commit such an atrocity!"

I was irritated by the perpetrator's nonsense, but anger was growing towards the knights as well. Allowing such a heinous act so easily and then acting all high and mighty.

For now, I had to put that aside. Right now, I had to focus all my energy on treating Ekaterina!

"Healer, keep using restorative magic! I will conduct the examination!"

I sat across from the healer who continued to cast restorative magic and examined the pale-faced Ekaterina.

I circulated my magic throughout Ekaterina's body, perceiving every single cell.

From the examination, I deduced that she had been stabbed in the abdomen. Some of her internal organs were damaged in the process, and the healer's magic couldn't completely heal them.

Furthermore, the poison had spread throughout her entire body, and it was at a point where she could die at any moment.

"!!"

Realizing this, I didn't even have time to let out a voice before activating my healing magic.

First, I began repairing the damaged organs within Ekaterina's abdomen by cultivating cells from the same organs.

Next, purification of the poison!

Since the poison had already spread throughout her entire body, I envisioned cleansing it through the veins. The magic of the purification image, once sent through the veins, returned to the heart and then circulated throughout her body.

The reason I could take this method of purifying the poison through the abdomen and the veins, which might take some time, was because there was someone continuously applying healing magic to her. This way, we could at least maintain the current condition if not a complete recovery.

Beside the healer who continued to cast healing magic, I also continued to cast purification magic.

Hold on!

Don't go!

You're the person who was Grandma's disciple, Grandpa's student, and the one who told me to call you "Mom," right?

Don't die from something like this poison!

I kept casting purification magic with desperate hopes.

How much time passed since then?

"O... oh..."

Someone let out a voice.

What happened?

I was completely occupied with purifying the poison, and I couldn't see my surroundings. What happened!?

Just as I was thinking that, someone touched my head.

"!?"

And then I followed the owner of that hand...

"Ahh..."

There she was...

"Shin... kun... you came..."

With her eyes half-open, Ekaterina gently caressed me with trembling hands.

"Ekaterina-san! I'm so glad! Really... I'm so glad..."

We made it!

It was a very close call, but we managed to save Ekaterina's life!

With that thought, tears streamed from my eyes.

In response, Ekaterina wiped my tears away with her trembling hand.

"Oh my... Shin-kun, you're such a crybaby..."

Even though she was probably in pain, her voice was full of tenderness, and she really felt like a mother.

This thought shattered my already fragile tear ducts...

"Uwaaaa!"

I was so surprised!

"It's a miracle! The holy messenger performed a miracle!"

"Yes! Your Holiness! Thank goodness you're safe!"

People who had been watching the situation closely all erupted into cheers.

I was surprised because I had been focused on my own world.

Feeling a bit more composed, I called out to have Ekaterina, who had been through an exhausting ordeal despite her life being saved, returned to her room for rest.

Just then...

"You... You! It's you! Shin-Wolford, isn't it?! Because of you! It's your fault!"

The man who had been restrained suddenly shouted.

That magic, what is this!?

"Wa... Wait! Someone, behead him!"

My grandpa shouted at the man who had amplified his magic and instructed to cut off the man's head.

A knight, reacting to the command, drew his sword and struck down from above with such force that not only did the man's head come off, but the sword pierced into the floor. With such momentum, there's no way the man's head could still be attached to his body.

Everyone was left in shock as they stared at the man's lifeless body. Eventually, their eyes turned towards my grandpa, who had issued the order.

And then, my grandpa, under everyone's gaze, said something shocking.

"...That was a close call. That man was on the verge of transforming into a demon."

That's right.

The magical power that man had emitted earlier.

It bore a striking resemblance to the magical power Kuruto emitted before transforming into a demon.

If we had left him alone, he probably would have transformed into a demon.

"A demon transformation!?"

"How terrifying..."

"Lord Shin saved us."

"Lord Shin saved the Pope, and Lord Merlin is once again going to defeat a demon. Truly, you're a hero's family."

Well... the one who delivered the finishing blow was a knight.

It seems the atmosphere changed because people around were getting excited about this, so I didn't feel like mentioning that.

"More importantly, let's quickly take Ekaterina back to her room! She absolutely needs to rest now!"

Maybe because we had just escaped various crises, my grandpa shouted and got the atmosphere back on track.

Today is the day I'm getting to see a surprising side of my grandpa.

It's quite different from the usual easygoing grandpa I know.

"Ha... Hey! We need a stretcher right away..."

"Ah, it's alright. I'll take her myself."

"Huh? Uh, but the holy messenger should not..."

"It's less of a burden this way than using a stretcher, isn't it?"

While saying this, I cast levitation magic on Ekaterina.

"Oh... Oh my..."

"We'll transport you like this. I'm sorry, but could you prepare some liquid food? His Holiness Nei Xia must consume it."

To replenish the lost blood, we'll need to produce blood from the bone marrow. For that, she needs some nutrition.

"Yes, of course! I'll prepare it right away!"

Among the stunned onlookers who were watching in astonishment as I used levitation magic to lift Ekaterina, one of the knights who snapped back to reality hurriedly ran outside the audience room.

"Well then, Pope Nei Xia, I'm coming."

"Hehe... Yes... Please..."

Although she seemed to be in pain due to the lack of blood, she managed to smile and respond. With the proper blood transfusion, she should be alright from now on.

As I contemplated this with a clear head, relieved that the crisis was over, the healing magician who had been treating Ekaterina approached me.

"You're amazing, holy messenger... I couldn't have saved His Holiness Nei Xia... I'm quite down about it..."

She talked in a rather dejected manner.

To change her perspective and make her see her own worth, I spoke to her.

"What are you saying? There's no doubt that it's thanks to you that His Holiness Nei Xia's life was saved."

"Huh?"

"The poison that was afflicting His Holiness Nei Xia had spread throughout her entire body. It was a situation where she could have died at any moment."

"S-She was in such a state?"

When I told her how critical Ekaterina's condition was, the healing magician began trembling uncontrollably.

"But His Holiness Nei Xia is alive. Undoubtedly, it's because you continued using your healing magic."

"But... But that's..."

"It's the truth. Without you, it wouldn't have been possible to save His Holiness Nei Xia's life. I'm really grateful."

This is an undeniable fact.

While I was attempting to purify the poison, the healing magician continued to apply her magic.

If it weren't for her, we probably wouldn't have made it in time.

I want her to have confidence in that.

"I may not understand healing magic much beyond basic injuries, but if Shin says so, it must be true. Thank you, and let me express my gratitude."

"What? Please, raise your head, Sage! To someone like me..."

The healing magician, who had said that, fell silent. It was because Ekaterina held her hand.

"Without your... healing magic, I wouldn't be alive... Thank you."

Ekaterina said with a smile.

"Such... such... it's nothing... it's nothing..."

Overwhelmed with gratitude from her beloved Pope, the healing magician continued to say it was nothing while shedding tears.

As we arrived at Ekaterina's private room, from which we had emerged earlier, Grandpa asked everyone to leave.

"Ekaterina hasn't fully recovered yet. She'll need more time for treatment. Could we have some privacy from here on?"

"Yes, of course. Holy messenger, please take care of Pope Nei Xia."

"Yes, I understand."

As we were about to enter the room, a knight who had reproached Grandpa came running from the room, dropped to the floor, and began prostrating.

It was quite an extraordinary sliding prostration.

"I'm truly sorry for my actions earlier! I'll accept any punishment! I'm sorry!"

He was apologizing in this way.

Ah, it seems he's feeling responsible for detaining the people who came to save Ekaterina.

Certainly, at that time, I was quite annoyed because I was on edge, but his actions were not wrong.

What should we do?

"Hey, Gramps. Did someone apologize to us or something?"

"I'm not sure... Faithful knights in their duty, I've seen."

"Huh?"

The knight was utterly dumbfounded by our nonchalant response.

"I apologize for earlier. My emotions got the better of me due to this child's crisis."

"No, it's not..."

"The fault was mine. Can you forgive me?"

"Well, hahaha! We don't blame the person who saved Pope Nei Xia! We apologize for our actions. And we sincerely thank you for saving Pope Nei Xia!"

"Well, then, we will begin Ekaterina's treatment. Pardon us."

"Yes!"

Saying that, Grandpa entered the room with us and Ekaterina's private room.

Beyond another door in the room was a bedroom, and there we laid Ekaterina down.

When we looked at Ekaterina, she seemed to be chuckling.

"Ekaterina, what's going on?"

"Hehe, professor... You managed to deceive him nicely..."

Even though her body was in pain, she seemed to find it amusing. She just kept laughing.

"What's going on? What are you talking about?"

"It's because it's you, professor... You got angry, didn't you? That's not good, you'll get scolded again... by your master..."

Ekaterina had clearly noticed that Grandpa got angry at the knight earlier.

While I continued to cast a magic spell that imagined creating blood from her bone marrow, I asked her.

"How did you know that Grandpa got angry?"

"That knight from earlier, he must have detained the professor who suddenly appeared, right? In situations like that, if it were the old professor, he would definitely get angry."

A bit of her blood seemed to have returned.

She was getting a lot more talkative.

"Is that so? Honestly, I've never seen Grandpa like that before, so I was quite surprised."

"Is that so? Professor, you're acting like a good grandpa in front of Shin, aren't you?"

Ekaterina began chuckling again.

Oh, there's a vein pulsating on Grandpa's temple...

"If you're feeling so good, the treatment should be sufficient by now. Shin, let's go back."

"Huh? No, no, it's not true. Don't get mad, professor... Oh, wait?"

She seemed to be trying to stop Grandpa from leaving.

She tried to sit up from the bed, but her arm slipped, and she ended up sprawled across the bed.

"Oh, well... what can we do with her? Lie down quietly."

"Aren't you going home?"

"Oh, no. I'll stay by your side."

"Hehe, thanks, professor..."

It feels more like a father and daughter than a teacher and student relationship...

...No, if we're talking about reality, it would have been a stepfather and stepdaughter...

The reassurance from my healing magic and Grandpa's presence... Plus, Ekaterina seemed to be feeling much better after having some liquid food prepared along the way. Now she was sitting up on the bed.

"By the way, that healing magic is amazing. The stab wounds are already healed. But now I'm really hungry..."

While asking for her third helping, Ekaterina mumbled.

"Uh, 'Saisei' means... 'healing'? '

I unintentionally explained the principles of healing magic. Not that it made much sense to her.

"Professor, I don't understand what Shin is talking about..."

"Don't worry, I don't get it either."

"You... don't?"

"I honestly have no idea what's going on in this kid's head. To be frank, he's nothing short of a genius."

"Isn't that going a bit too far, old man?"

"Hahaha!"

"Old man! Well, that's one way to put it."

"Even Merida has the same opinion."

"Even the Master...? So it really is true..."

"Hold on! Why is it that I'm 'old man,' but you're just 'old man' and 'Merida' is perfectly acceptable!?"

"Huh? I can't even imagine the Master spoiling his grandchild..."

"Hmm..."

She hit the nail on the head like she had seen it all. She definitely knows a lot about Grandpa and Grandma.

"So, why is Shin considered a genius?"

"He must have shown you that magic we used at the Gate.

"Indeed. That was quite a surprise. I was impressed by the long-distance communication device, but that magic was something else."

"Shin developed that magic."

"What!? Ugh! Ugh!"

"Oh, Ekaterina! Calm down!"

She was extremely shocked, screamed, and then coughed loudly.

After coughing for a while, Ekaterina finally settled down and spoke to Grandpa.

"I was shocked... I thought for sure it was developed by you, Professor... I was truly impressed by your brilliance."

After all, hardly anyone except for Earlsheid knows about the Gate magic.

"By the way... I heard that Shin-kun also invented the communication device."

Indeed, I taught magic, and Merida taught the creation of magical tools. Shin has elevated that knowledge on his own. How can you describe it as anything other than genius?

"You're right..."

Mmm, I hope she doesn't say that kind of thing in front of him; it's embarrassing.

After continuing to use healing magic for a while, Ekaterina's condition improved significantly. Now, there was a sense of relief.

"Now, Karce. Why did this happen? What were the knights doing?"

Since Ekaterina's health had returned, Grandpa began questioning the events.

I was also curious. Could anyone simply attack the head of state like this? Or were the guards severely negligent?

"In regard to that... it was pure negligence... They completely let their guard down..."

"Negligence?"

"Yes. The leader of Dahm went berserk, you know? That's why the chance to capture the demon almost slipped away..."

"Yes, if it weren't for you, we don't know what would have become of Earlsheid."

If Grandpa and Grandma hadn't stopped them, Earlsheid might have turned into a battlefield. When I think about it, it's an unimaginable situation.

"The Dahm envoy came and wanted to apologize. Since Dahm is where the central branch of the Church of the Founder is located, we considered them our closest ally..."

Ah, I see. While she phrased it gently, Dahm is treated as a subordinate country in Yeuse. They might have underestimated an envoy from their subordinate nation. That's probably how they took advantage of the situation.

"This is really... an embarrassing story."

"I have no words..."

The current Ekaterina seemed more like a student scolded by a teacher than the Pope. She looked subdued under Grandpa's criticism.

And still, the words the Dahm envoy shouted are bothering me.

"I didn't seem to like being referred to as 'His Messenger.' The Dahm leader felt the same way. Perhaps that's common in Dahm?"

I didn't introduce myself, but being denied like this is really disheartening...

"No, that's not true. The decision to recognize Shin-kun as His Messenger was made during the summit meeting, right? Of course, Dahm's King was present as well. He readily agreed."

"What about that envoy's statement?"

"Well..."

As she said that, Ekaterina fell silent.

I'm curious about that envoy's words, but there's something even more concerning.

"Besides... you almost transformed into a demon, right? Is that reason enough for them to resent you?"

"It's true... It's hard to believe it was just because of that."

"Before, Kurt... a boy from the magic academy, transformed into a demon easily too. But back then..."

As I spoke, something clicked in my mind.

"Could it be... Kurt, that boy from before, was used for human experiments by the leader of the demons."

"If there's a demon involved in this event again..."

Furthermore, what was Strom doing in the capital? He was conducting experiments to turn creatures into monsters. So, maybe the answer to the question Oug posed a few days ago lies here. When demons appeared, disaster-level monsters started appearing too, but then they disappeared. Could it be that Strom succeeded in turning creatures into monsters? So, wolves, which were known for being not very cunning, became disaster-level monsters, and deer, which were never seen before as monsters, and even a non-monster like a rhinoceros turned into one. This suggests that Strom's experiments might still be ongoing.

"Grandpa... we might have misunderstood everything..."

"Misunderstood?"

"Strom might not have any intention to invade. But he might not have stopped his experiments on monsters."

"That's..."

Even Grandpa couldn't deny it. He was left speechless.

I thought I should convey this hypothesis to Oug right away. The way we respond to the situation could change dramatically depending on whether this hypothesis is correct or not.

"Ekaterina, are you feeling better now?"

"Yes, thank you. I've completely recovered."

"Your body has lost a little muscle mass, so make sure to eat well and exercise. That should help you get back to your normal condition."

"Is that so? Just when my meat was decreasing..."

"Having some flesh on your bones is essential for good health. Anyway, if you're feeling better, can I go back now?"

"Sure, but what about our previous conversation?"

"Right. I need to go back and talk to Oug about it. It's important."

Just as I was about to say that, the bell on my wireless communicator rang.

"What's that? What's that sound?"

"Oh, sorry."

Ekaterina was startled by the sudden ringing of the bell, so I apologized before answering the call.

"Hello? Who's there? Oh, it's Oug."

"Huh? Wireless!?"

Oh, I didn't mention that to Ekaterina, did I? She looked surprised in the background, but this was good timing because I had something to discuss with Oug.

"I'm glad you called now; I have something to discuss..."

"Just forget about that! Come to our rescue right away!"

"What? A rescue?"

After I said that, there was a loud explosion on the other end of the communication.

"Hey! What's going on!?"

"A demon! A demon has appeared!"

"A demon!?"

Why now? Moreover...

"What do you mean by rescue? We've been dealing with demons all this time, haven't we?"

"It's different this time! These demons..."

After that, Oug delivered some shocking news.

"These demons are incomparably stronger than the ones we've faced before!"
