 a fun fact
about the Roman Empire

"Walford Trading Company was amazing... right?"

"Oh, look! Shin is getting even richer."

"Your Highness! Yes, that's right. He's the same age as us, and yet, he's incredible."

"Hmph! Well, he seems to have some products in development. His wealth will continue to grow."

The conversations seem odd at times because they are having them while playing Magical Volley.

The topic is the recent opening of the Walford Trading Company.

The reason it became a topic is because Alice bought a pair of jet boots using her father's employee discount.

By the way, the jet boots she gave to Tony, the vibration sword, and everyone's combat gear, they all received payments.

It's at a discounted price, though.

They say it feels weird not to pay, so they reluctantly accept the money.

In truth, they would be fine with giving them away.

So, Alice wanted to try out the jet boots she had just bought, which led to them practicing Magical Volley during their self-study magic lessons.

They use magic without incantations, so it counts as magic practice, and they have Alfred's permission.

Alfred, their teacher, is on the sidelines, watching the game with an angry expression.

I think this is a good practice, but why not incorporate it into magic practice?

"Oh, come on! We already decided before using the jet boots!"

"Hmph... not letting useful tools go to waste is also a form of strategy."

Og is saying something cool again. It's just volleyball, you know? How obsessed are they, everyone?

"Mmm! I'll use them next time! Olivia, toss it even higher next time!"

"Even higher?!"

"Absolutely! Here it comes!"

With Alice's shout, the game resumes.

Tony from Og's team hits the ball with a super high-angle, high-speed jump serve using the jet boots and body enhancement, and it approaches Alice's team's court.

"Hey! Using them before us is unfair!"

"We received them as gifts!"

Julius shows a nice receive as if he read the trajectory.

"Nice, Julius! Olivia, here it comes!"

"I'm on it, Alice!"

In a volleyball move never seen in their previous lives, Olivia sets an unbelievably high toss.

"We've been waiting for this!"

And then Alice finally activated the jet boots and leaped high into the air.

"Woohoo!"

The Ogre team, along with myself, couldn't move, and Alice's attack struck the court.

I couldn't move either.

"Great job! What do you think, Your Highness? You couldn't have gotten that one, right?"

"Yeah... I didn't expect such a move."

"To be honest, it was unexpected."

"Well, it was a sight to behold."

"A sight?"

Alice had a puzzled expression.

Now, it was supposed to be the time for magical practice in our uniforms.

They've been glancing around provocatively for a while now, but what just happened...

"Alice, you're... wearing cat panties."

"Cat? Wait... Ah, I see."

She finally noticed.

Alice blushed and held down her skirt.

Since the girls' uniforms had skirts, they shouldn't jump so high...

"Alice, we saw everything."

"Well, um... they are cute panties, so it's okay, right?"

"Yuri, a poor attempt at a follow-up can backfire."

"Nyaaa!"

Alice had cat panties, huh.

"Shin-kun?"

"W-what? Sissi."

"...It was nice seeing Alice's underwear, wasn't it?"

"N-no! I didn't mean to see it, it was just visible..."

"Hehehe..."

"It wasn't intentional! It wasn't!"

The rest of the time was spent comforting Alice, who was embarrassed and curled up in the corner of the practice area, and trying to calm down the smiley Sissi.

"Sigh... during the summer break, how far have you all climbed? There's no point in going to the Magic Academy like this."

"Is that so? I think studying is important."

Honestly, it feels like, what did you come to the academy for?

"We're about to resume the joint training with the Knight Academy... What will you do? Doesn't it seem unnecessary for you?"

"Well, there are things we want to do during that time."

"Things you want to do? What, Walford?"

"We'll participate in thinning out the monsters. However... we'd like to participate on our own, not in a joint training with the Knight Academy."

"Very well... may I ask for the reason?"

"Last time, on our way back from the Three Kingdoms conference, we were attacked by a horde of monsters. At that time, we tried to hunt without dropping the value of the materials, but everyone had a tough time... I think it would be good practice if we can hunt precisely."

It turned out to be good practice for everyone, so I had been thinking about incorporating it.

I thought it was a good idea, but Alfred-sensei seemed to be troubled, holding his brow.

Why?

"Hunting monsters without dropping the value of the materials... isn't that something veteran hunters think about? Have you all already reached that level?"

"Well... everyone here can already hunt disaster-class monsters. But we rely on brute force, so I want them to learn more precise control of magical power."

If they can perform precise magical power control, they might be able to approach and surround the magic humans while hiding their magic power, ensuring they don't escape this time. It also broadens their attack capabilities, so I think it's all for the better.

"...Well, the primary goal of this training is to establish smooth cooperation between knights and mages. It might not be necessary for you, who are already self-sufficient as combat forces."

"Our goal is the magic humans."

So, while the joint training of the Magic Academy and the Knight Academy is underway, we decided to train in precise magical power control against monsters.

"Hey, Shin, thanks for before."

"Living with a toilet that has a cleaning function... it's like a dream."

"The refrigerator we bought together is convenient too."

"But, for us ordinary people who can't control magic as well as mages, freezing that much water is tough. Can't we do something about it?"

The joint training is part of the curriculum, so even if we split up from the group, we have to gather at the meeting point. But no one approached us, and they just kept glancing in our direction, including the members of the Knights and the Mage Corps.

In the midst of that, only Zeek and Chris approached us as usual. They wanted to talk about the magical tools we bought recently.

"It's not a big deal. As for the refrigerator, if you have magic stones, you can keep it constantly cold..."

In fact, we've already converted our refrigerator to that type. The maids are praising it as convenient.

"Magic stones, huh... We're still researching them."

"What's the progress like?"

"Some knights have been dispatched by the Knight Order as well. They're excavating the locations Shin reported..."

At that point, Zeek lowered his voice.

"...It seems they're starting to appear here and there."

"I see, just as I expected."

"Even so... as soon as Shin entered the world, one thing after another..."

"He was already quite extraordinary when he was in the forest. I wonder what will happen when he enters the world..."

"Both of you knew Shin when he was little, right? What kind of child was he?"

When I started talking about the time I was in the forest, Sissi, who should have heard stories about my childhood, asked the two of them.

I wonder if they wanted to hear the story from their perspective too?

"We've been in charge of His Majesty's protection for the past four to five years, so we don't know what happened before that..."

"When we first met, it was quite surprising. After all..."

"This guy brought back a giant bear on his back."

That's right. I had killed a pretty big bear that wasn't transformed into a monster, and I wanted to brag to my grandparents, so I carried it back.

"A huge bear suddenly appeared from the shadows, so we were on guard too."

"At that time... were you ten years old? Shin was still small, so he was hidden from view because of the bear."

Zeek and Chris reminisced with a nostalgic look. Hearing that, everyone...

"...I wonder what it is. Normally, this should be surprising..."

"Just the fact that it's Shin-kun makes it acceptable!"

It's okay to be a little more surprised, you know? You guys.

"Haha! You've been accepted nicely."

"I was worried that it might be a concern to be friends with such an extraordinary kid... but it seems my fears were unfounded."

"Hey, stop it..."

Seeing me being accepted by everyone, the two of them happily pet my head.

It's embarrassing to have this kind of thing happen at my age... but I couldn't bring myself to brush off the hands of the two who seemed so happy... I let them do it.

Everyone's warm gazes...

"Fufu, you two really dote on Shin-kun."

"Oh, this is what they say."

"Yes, it's the children who give you trouble that you find cute."

"Did he really give us that much trouble?"

"What are you saying! When you take your eyes off him for a moment, he disappears right away."

"And when you think he's gone, he comes back all covered in blood."

"B-blood?!"

Sissi reacted to the blood comment and sent a worried look.

"We thought something had happened too."

"He failed to kill his prey and got covered in its blood..."

"Oh, I remember that. That happened."

"Yeah, there were... or not!"

"It's true! How worried do you think we were!?"

"S-Sorry..."

As I recalled those events, I was scolded severely by the two.

"You've caused quite a lot of trouble in other ways."

"When we were at the Sage's house, we were more worried about Shin than protecting His Majesty."

Oh, really... I didn't realize it at the time because I was just a child, but they were worried about me...

"To be honest, I was worried. I thought, who would be friends with such an extraordinary kid?"

"But now, to have so many friends... Thank you, everyone."

"Thank you."

Zeek and Chris, like true older siblings, expressed their gratitude to everyone.

I'm happy, but... it's embarrassing.

"So, is that no-good little brother of yours up to something again?"

"I heard he's going to hunt monsters alone... What's that about?"

"It's nothing strange."

I explained to the two about our current goal. Both of them had an exasperated expression.

"Training to extract monster materials without causing any damage..."

"At this age, most people don't even hunt monsters... Have you already adopted the same mindset as veterans?"

"That's just a side effect. The main goal is to improve precise magic techniques."

"Hunting monsters is part of the training."

"It was a good decision not to let these kids participate in the joint training. The Knight Academy students would have definitely lost their confidence."

"Same goes for the students of the Magic Academy."

"More importantly, aren't you two supposed to be their escorts? Shouldn't you go to the squads you're responsible for?"

They've been with us the whole time, but shouldn't they greet the squads they're responsible for?

"Our responsibility is you... well, it's mostly you."

"Me?"

"We were asked by the academy and His Majesty to make sure you don't do anything reckless."

"Huh? So you're here to keep an eye on me? There's no need for that."

"Don't think it's going to be that easy!"

"Think of it as an opportunity to reflect on your past actions. We volunteered for this position if we didn't get the official orders."

"Me too. I just couldn't imagine you not doing something reckless!"

So, it's not escort duty but surveillance.

In that sense, I'm not trustworthy...

"Shin, now that we know your and their goals, shall we head out soon? You're planning to go deep into the dungeon, right?"

"I see. Then, Zeek and Chris, come with us."

Now, shall we begin our precise magic practice against monsters?

"Oh, they're here. There are a lot of monsters today."

"It's truly an abnormal situation. If we don't resolve this issue soon, the world will be overrun by monsters."

"So, what's the plan from here?"

"You know, monsters have a tendency to gather when they sense magic, right?"

"Yes, it's said that monsters attack creatures with magic."

"So, when a large group moves with a lot of magic..."

"Then, if we gather magic like this..."

Collect a large amount of magic and leave it without converting it into a spell.

And then...

"Hey... hey, hey!"

"What's going on, Zeek?"

"What's going on? A tremendous number of monsters are gathering!"

Zeek's words caused commotion among everyone.

Normally, magic is instantly converted into spells, so leaving gathered magic like this is not something people do. However, if monsters are attracted to magic, I thought that by collecting magic like this, it could become bait, and it seemed I was right.

"Everyone, be aware of the monsters."

"Yes."

"Yes, we're fine."

"Then, work in pairs. One person attacks the monsters without damaging the materials, and the other takes care of any missed monsters, making sure they don't get close to their partner. You don't have to worry about collecting materials in that case."

"Is this a backup plan?"

"Hmm, you're surprisingly well-prepared."

"What do you two think of me?"

I wouldn't conduct training that puts everyone at risk. Even before this, I sent a Catastrophe-class monster for subjugation because I thought it would be fine.

"Shisiri, you're with me."

"It's reassuring to be with Shin."

Even though it's before our monster subjugation, Shisiri looked pleased. It's good to have her trust, but this is not such a simple matter.

"Alright, we have our pairs. Then, the starting pairs..."

Everyone formed pairs and got ready, just as the monsters entered their range.

"Fire!"

The starting pairs simultaneously cast spells. They damaged a few materials, but the subjugation itself was going smoothly.

"Oh, I sliced another one in half."

"Alice still has a long way to go... Ugh."

The monster that Alice missed with her attack managed to slip through the magical defenses and approach.

Her partner, Lin, noticed it and cast a spell towards the approaching monster.

"It's hot! Lin, why would you use fire magic at such close range?"

"Don't worry, Alice is a strong girl."

"I don't understand the logic here!"

What are they doing over there? However, despite that, the monster subjugation was progressing well.

It would have been better if they could have collected the monster materials, but since I told the support team not to worry about gathering them, there's nothing that can be done.

Shisiri is focused on the subjugation, perhaps because I'm supporting her. Occasionally, monsters come toward us, but everyone can handle it without any issues.

After a while, the first wave of monsters is dealt with.

"Phew! That was tiring!"

"We damaged the materials more than expected."

"Hmm, this is quite challenging."

"Yes... what a waste."

"This is... quite a rewarding task."

"Hehe, thanks to Shin, I could concentrate."

The starting team is sharing their impressions, but there isn't much time to spare.

"Look, here comes the second wave. Starting team, switch with the support team."

"What? Already?"

"The monsters won't wait for us."

"Shin... didn't you gather magic power earlier?"

"You're imagining things, right? Anyway, they're coming!"

Actually, Maria's observation was correct. I had secretly gathered magic power earlier to attract the monsters.

"Here they come! Fire!"

Upon my command, the support team, following the same procedure as the starting team, begins to subjugate the monsters.

"Ah, I wasn't mentally prepared for this!"

"Ugh, I messed up again."

"Ugh... such a waste."

"Oh, sorry about that! I let one slip through!"

"Ugh, I failed."

Maybe because the support team had less time to prepare than the starting team, they missed their shots more often.

"Shin, you're amazing... it's a perfect score..."

"Well, something like this is expected. I used to shoot down flocks of birds in the past."

"...So, that means..."

"We got bird meat, right?"

"Compared to that, these monsters are like big targets."

"That's the idea."

In the end, the support team, unable to recover completely, is feeling down.

"If only we were a bit more prepared..."

"Walford, you're so ruthless."

As Maria and Yuri complained about the situation, Chris spoke up before I could respond.

"Do you guys need the enemy to announce, 'We're going to attack now' before you can fight properly?"

"Your magic is incredible, but you're still quite naive when it comes to tactics. Ambushes are common on the battlefield, you know?"

Clearly, Zeke and Chris had understood my intentions.

"I deliberately didn't give them a preparation period. We're not facing ordinary monsters this time. It's the Demonkind, and they are conscious beings."

With our words, everyone's expressions turned grave, even Og.

"So far, they've only attacked head-on, but the fact that there haven't been any attacks in such a long period might mean they're preparing something. So, it might not be as easy as before."

Suddenly, it dawned on everyone.

"It'll be too late if we wait for that to happen... If that happens, I..."

These were the first friends I had made as equals in this world. I didn't want to lose any of them. For that, I was willing to...

"In any case, here comes the third wave. It's already close."

"What?!?"

Well, well, if we don't hurry, the swarm of monsters will be upon us.

"It seems Shin can be quite strict at times."

"Ah! They're here!"

"And... what's our objective?"

"Of course, collecting materials."

"Ack!"

Hahaha, even if we can't gather materials, it's not like anyone is going to die, so we can put in some effort.

"It's tough..."

"Oh, Shisiri, you will continue the subjugation without switching out later."

"Huh? Why?"

"Because, if I join, it won't be a real practice, right? Don't worry, I'll watch over you closely."

"Nooo!"

This way, Shisiri's skills should improve.

Well, I'm quite the considerate fiancé, aren't I?

"Shin is an S, huh..."

"That was unexpected."

Hey, the one leading! Stop saying weird things!

"Nooo!"

Shisiri was giving it her all, even as she teared up.

Her crying face is adora...

"Shin is a pervert."

"That was unexpected."

Hey, the one leading!! Don't say strange things!!!
