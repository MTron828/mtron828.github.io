 airplane turbulence
to someone who has never flown before

Elizabeth had been under a terrible misunderstanding.

"Um... why such a misunderstanding?"

"Every time you open your mouth, it's always Shin, Shin, Shin! You go to Shin's house whenever you have even a little bit of free time, so it's not unreasonable to think that way!"

"No! That's unreasonable, isn't it?"

"Do you think so?"

"Yes, I do!"

Why do August and I have to be misunderstood like that? It's disgusting!

Ah! Could it be that you have a twisted mind!?

As I was feeling this new suspicion, August began speaking with a sigh.

"Well... of all people, it had to be Shin... There should be other girls in the research club. Well, more importantly, it's true that I made a friend in Shin who doesn't make me feel uncomfortable at all, and I got carried away."

"You got carried away too much! After I got to know Shin, he rarely visited me..."

"True, it's easier when you're hanging out with male friends. August, do you feel pressured when you're with me?"

"Well, I... Mogah!"

"No! It's not like that, Ellie! I feel at ease when I'm with you."

"But..."

"True, there are differences in how men and women interact. With guys, you can do silly things. It was my first experience, so I got carried away."

"That's right..."

August covered my mouth with his hand as he spoke.

He must be really desperate.

I couldn't help but smile, and it seemed to be conveyed through August's hand.

"What are you laughing at?"

He asked as he removed his hand from my mouth.

"It's not like I'm thinking, 'He's desperate,' or anything."

"Damn! I can't believe the day would come when I'd be teased by Shin!"

He looks like he's deeply regretting it! How rude!

"...You still seem suspicious."

"That's not true!"

"That's right, Shin already has a girlfriend, so he doesn't have time for anything else."

"Is that so?"

"August, what are you saying?"

"Shin, it's time for you to be clear."

Protesting against August's sudden statement, I was surprised to see that he responded with a serious expression.

"Be clear...?"

The security guards and Mr. Dis, whom I've already seen a few times, weren't surprised, but the two newcomers were astonished as they looked at the gate's magic.

"All right, Mr. Dis, I'll come back tomorrow, and Mei-chan will take care of her responsibilities here."

"Very well, Father. I'll return to the training camp."

"Yes, be careful. And Shin, make sure to control yourself."

"..."

"Father, it's too late for that."

"I see. I thought it was too late to warn you."

"Then, I'll be going! Both of you, go through this gate!"

The conversation was veering in a strange direction, so I urged the bewildered two to go through the gate.

Once they passed through the gate, they found themselves in Claude's town, where steam from hot springs was rising.

Although they could have used the gate to go straight to the Claude family mansion, they decided to open the gate at a location near the town's entrance since they had come to the hot spring town.

"It's... really Claude's town..."

"This is amazing! We were in the castle just a moment ago, and now we're in Claude's town!"

Elizabeth was in disbelief, while Mei-chan was excited about the gate's magic.

I was feeling relieved by Mei-chan's genuine enthusiasm for my magic.

"Mei, don't get too carried away and get lost."

"Oops! Wait for me!"

Mei-chan followed me to ensure she didn't get lost in an unfamiliar town.

"Mei-chan, what is it?"

"What is it, Shin Onii-chan?"

"It's because it would be troublesome if we got separated, you see."

"Huh? Okay!"

I held out my hand, and Mei-chan took it, which made me feel warm inside.

"...Even though you can do such things naturally, why do you panic when it's important?"

"Well, even Lord August had trouble proposing to me."

"Hey, don't bring that up!"

In front of us, August and Elizabeth were engaging in a lively conversation, with their arms linked.

I wanted to eavesdrop, but I couldn't leave Mei-chan, who was holding my hand and smiling, so I decided to be patient.

I'd tease them later.

"Shin... pretend you didn't hear what I just said."

"Huh? What are you talking about?"

"Don't act so smug..."

"Whose lines are those, the villain's?"

"Shin Onii-chan is amazing!"

Mei-chan gave me an admiring look, which made me feel embarrassed.

As they walked ahead, August and Elizabeth were arm in arm, looking quite friendly.

It seems that the misunderstanding from the earlier exchange with August has been cleared up.

It was good that they no longer had that uncomfortable misunderstanding, but as they approached the Claude family mansion where Sicily was, Shin began to feel a sense of tension.

"Shin Onii-chan, what's wrong?"

"Hmm? Oh, it's nothing."

Mei-chan, noticing that Shin had become more reserved, asked with a worried look.

Uh-oh, I shouldn't be making a little girl worry like this. I need to act more like my usual self.

Once he managed to calm himself down, they arrived at the Claude family mansion.

"This is the Claude family mansion."

"Welcome back, Lord Shin and Lord August. Are you returning from the outside today?"

"Yes, we just got back. I wanted to show these two around Claude's town."

"I'm so glad you liked our town that much!"

"Well... yeah, we did..."

The gatekeeper was quite moved. He must really love this town.

"By the way, who are these two?"

"My apologies for not introducing them earlier. I am Elizabeth von Coral, August's fiancée."

"I'm Mei von Earlsheid, August Onii-sama's little sister!"

Upon hearing this, the gatekeeper froze for a moment and then suddenly kneeled down.

"I-I'm terribly sorry! I didn't know that Your Highness had a fiancée and a princess, and I have been disrespectful!"

The gatekeeper bowed so deeply that it seemed like his head would touch the ground.

So, this is how people usually react.

"It's our fault as well. Please, raise your head."

"Y-Yes, I apologize for my rudeness!"

With those words, the gatekeeper stood up.

"Hey, Elizabeth, should I also adopt this kind of attitude?"

"No need for that, Shin-san. If you start behaving this way to someone who's busy having a face-off with August-sama, they might get confused, so please refrain."

"That's right! Shin Onii-chan is fine just the way he is!"

"If Shin suddenly adopts that kind of attitude, I would start suspecting he's up to something..."

So there's a comedy routine going on...

But more importantly, Elizabeth's words and the fact that they received permission meant that they should continue as they were.

"Could you please inform the others about these two staying here from now on?"

"Yes, of course!"

Saying this, another person rushed into the mansion.

"Let's go inside, shall we?"

"Yes!"

"Understood."

"Hehe, it's like we've become residents of this house, isn't it?"

"That's not something you should be saying!"

Oh, the tension is back!

"August-sama..."

"Onii-sama, you have a bad personality!"

Just when they had finally returned to their usual selves, they reverted right before the meeting with Sicily...

"Hey, Shin-kun, did you just come back from outside?"

As soon as they entered the mansion, they encountered Sicily.

Of course, it had to be at a time like this!

"Uh, yeah, well... um, these two wanted to see Claude's town..."

Shin introduced Elizabeth and Mei-chan.

"It's been a while, Elizabeth-sama, Princess Mei."

Sicily seemed to know them.

"It's been a while, Sicily-san. We'll be in your care from today."

"It's been a while, Sicily-san! I'm looking forward to being with you!"

"Huh? Are the two of you also participating in the training camp?"

"No, we just came to meet August-sama."

"We've been given time off, but he won't play with us, so we came here."

"We won't disturb your training, so please forgive us."

"Please, Claude, I also ask for your favor. Could you take care of these two as well?"

Sicily, who had been asked by August as well, looked at Shin.

"Well, um... August has been keeping August quite busy with the research club, so it seems that we won't be able to spend much time together with them... so, is it okay?"

"If it's okay with Shin-kun and His Highness, I'm fine with it."

"What?!"

"Shin-kun, what's wrong? Your attitude is a bit strange..."

"I-It's nothing! I'm just being normal!"

"Is that so?"

Sicily tilted her head, and Shin noticed that August was trying to hold back his laughter behind them.

Damn it! I'll remember this later!

"Oh, I see. You were talking about Sicily earlier."

"Shin Onii-chan and Sicily-san make a great couple!"

"Huh?"

"Wait a minute, both of you! What are you saying!?"

Why are you blurting out these things!

"Shin-kun... something's definitely off, isn't it?"

"N-No, it's not like that! Anyway, has Grandma's lecture finished?"

"Oh, yes. It just ended, and now we're planning to take a bath before dinner..."

As Sicily said this, everyone came out from the inner room.

"Milady Merida, your lecture was absolutely wonderful."

"Is that so? It can't be anything special after seeing Shin's enhancement magic, right?"

"Walford-kun's enhancement is... well, it's a bit hard to understand."

"Yes, certainly. It may be just right for an ordinary person."

"I didn't mean to imply that Milady Merida is inferior or anything..."

"Don't worry about it. That kid is just abnormal."

"Right, indeed."

"Hey! Don't call me an abnormal kid behind my back!"

They're saying whatever they want without restraint!

"Oh, welcome back. You were late, huh?"

"They treated me normally?!?"

"Shin, what are you making a fuss about?"

"Huh? The conversation just now, wasn't it strange?"

"What do you mean?"

"Could it be... am I being treated as an abnormal person?"

"Why are you saying this now? Everyone knows that your magic is extraordinary."

"That's right, it's quite late to bring it up now."

I knew it, but I couldn't resist making a comment.

"Heh... hahaha!"

Watching this exchange, Ellie burst into laughter.

"Oh, it's so amusing. August-sama is always involved in such conversations, isn't he?"

Saying this, Ellie looked at August.

It seems she now understands the reason why August is so engrossed in the research club.

"Um... Shin Onii-chan..."

Mei-chan tugged on my sleeve.

Oh, right. This child looks up to Grandma.

"Grandma."

"Hmm? What is it?"

"This is August's sister, Mei-chan."

"Huh! Um, um, I'm August Onii-sama's sister, Mei! Well... um..."

"It seems she admires Grandma."

"Oh, really? You're not disappointed that I'm such an old lady, unlike in books and on stage?"

"No! Not at all! You're much younger and beautiful, and..."

Saying this, she observed Grandma's body.

"I apologize for not introducing myself earlier. I am Elizabeth von Coral, August-sama's fiancée. I understand what Mei wants to say. Your age and body shape... I would love to learn from you."

Ellie also agreed with that statement.

Even Ellie showed a look of respect when she looked at Grandma.

Grandma really is the dream of all the girls in the kingdom.

"Hehe, thank you. Now then, I was thinking that we should all go to the hot springs before dinner. Will you two join us?"

"Yes, we want to go!"

"I will accompany you as well."

"Alright, Mei-chan, was it?"

"Y-Yes."

"Well then, let's go together."

"Huh!? Um, I mean..."

Confused by Grandma's outstretched hand, Mei-chan looked at me for help with her eyes.

"Grandma, please take care of Mei-chan."

"Sure, leave it to me."

"Now, Mei-chan."

"Yes, I-I'm sorry..."

She hesitantly took Grandma's hand.

Grandma smiled warmly as she held her hand.

"Girls are just so adorable."

"My apologies, I'm not as cute."

"That's true. You were quite a handful when you were younger, so I had to hold your hand to keep you in line."

"No way!? Really!?"

"Now, Mei-chan, shall we go to the hot springs?"

"Yes!"

With that, the two of them walked away together.

As I stood there in astonishment at this shocking turn of events, everyone gave me sympathetic looks.

"I can understand how Milady Merida feels."

"It's hard not to worry with kids like Shin around!"

"Indeed, it's quite efficient. I understand completely."

"I'm sorry, Walford-kun. I can relate to it."

"I hope my child won't need such measures."

Their sympathetic gazes were all directed at Grandma!

Overwhelmed by the treatment, I ended up kneeling.

"Um... I am..."

Only Sicily seemed to hesitate. If she hesitated, it must mean she thinks the same...

"It's okay... Sicily, you think the same way, don't you?"

"N-No, it's not like that! If they were Shin-kun's children... They would be cute, and I'd gladly hold their hands!"

Wait... Something seems off about the topic...

Realizing the change, there was a moment of silence as those around us understood.

"Sicily... Are you...?"

"Huh? What? I don't get what's going on."

"A grand self-destruct. It took me by surprise."

"Huh? Ah, yeah!"

Sicily, who had realized what she had just said, turned bright red, from her face to her neck...

"N-No! Ahh!"

She then ran off toward the hot springs.

While everyone else looked on with warm amusement, both Aug and I couldn't quite get into the spirit.

"Shin, you do realize, right?"

"Yeah, I'm not so dense that I can't tell when she goes that far."

"You're dense enough that you need her to go that far to understand."

"Ugh..."

"Well... do your best."

"Yeah."

With that said, we headed towards the hot springs...

"Oh? Gramps, were you here?"

"Ho ho... I've been here the whole time..."

Grandpa's transformation into thin air had progressed...

We consoled him slightly as he seemed a bit down, and then went into the hot springs.

After we came out of the hot springs and during dinner, Sicily's face remained bright red, and she didn't look at us, so there was quite an awkward atmosphere.

The servants couldn't stop grinning either.

After dinner, everyone had their free time.

The two who had come today were talking with Grandma, while other groups had gathered around Grandpa to improve their magic, including Lynn and Thor.

It's good for you, Gramps... You haven't been forgotten...

As for me, I didn't have much to do, and my body was still warm from the hot springs and dinner, so I went outside.

There's a pond in the mansion's garden, and there's a gazebo next to it, so I thought I'd cool off there.

The night sky, with the sun now completely set, was filled with countless stars.

As I looked up at the starry sky, I realized once again that this wasn't Earth. I couldn't find a single familiar constellation.

"After all... it's not Earth."

"Huh? Shin-kun!?"

"Hm? Oh, Sicily?"

There was someone already in the gazebo.

"W-What are you doing here?"

"Oh, I thought I'd cool off here since my body is still hot from the hot springs and dinner. How about you, Sicily?"

"I-I also... Yes! I got overheated in the hot springs too!"

"I see. Hey, Sicily."

"Y-Yes!"

"Mind if I sit here?"

"Y-Yeah!"

Sicily's response was somewhat strange, but I didn't think too much of it and sat down next to her.

Sicily seemed to be concerned about her earlier slip of the tongue. She remained completely red and silent, and I had no idea how to broach the subject. We spent some time in silence, unable to endure it any longer, and eventually Sicily spoke.

"Uh, Shin-kun... um, I'm really sorry about earlier."

"Huh? Oh, I don't mind... in fact, I was happy about it."

"Huh!?"

"Hey, Sicily, do you remember the first time we met?"

"Yes, I remember. Maria and I were being bothered by a man, and we were in trouble."

"Right, and when I asked, 'Are you in trouble?'..."

"You said, 'Yes! I'm in a lot of trouble!'... I wondered how someone could respond like that."

"Haha, yes, exactly! I thought the same."

"And then... you quickly defeated that man, and afterward, you treated us so courteously."

"You know, Sicily, when I saw you that day, it was like a bolt of lightning struck my head."

"Really..."

"You were such a cute girl."

"Huh! Uhm... well, I thought, 'What a cool person.'"

"I see..."

"Yes..."

"Sicily."

"Yes."

I looked into Sicily's face.

As I looked at the completely red Sicily, who seemed desperate, I...

"I like you, Sicily."

I confessed my feelings.

Upon hearing my confession, Sicily froze for a while, and then... she began to shed tears.

"I'm so... happy. I thought you might not have any feelings for me..."

"Did I make you think that way?"

"But! It's not like that... it's not like that now..."

"I see..."

"Yes..."

"I also... I also like you... I really like you, Shin-kun."

"Sicily..."

"Shin-kun..."

"Sicily... will you be my girlfriend?"

"Yes. Please make me your girlfriend, Shin-kun."

Yes! I wanted to scream inwardly but held back, gazing deeply into Sicily's eyes. Then, Sicily closed her eyes gently.

Is this... okay? She's already my girlfriend! With that thought, I began moving my face closer to Sicily's...

"Hey! Don't push too hard!"

"See, this is the moment! Let's go all the way!"

"Awwww!"

Suddenly, everyone came crashing in, making quite a commotion as they tumbled from the shadows of the trees near the pond.

The entire group, including Grandpa and Grandma, Ellie, May-chan, and even the maids, was there.

How cliché! But more importantly, how did they hide behind that tree shadow?

"N-n-n-no way!!!"

Sicily panicked at being seen by everyone. I stroked her head and looked at the group.

"Hey... isn't this a bit much for a peeping show?"

"An event of this magnitude can't be ignored!"

For some reason, Maria scolded me. Why?

"I'm the one who lit the fire under Shin, so I feel responsible for watching over."

"I'm August-sama's fiancée, so I share the same responsibility."

"Ahh, it's an adult thing!"

Og understood, but what about Ellie? And May-chan! An ten-year-old girl shouldn't be talking about adult matters!

"Shin! Well done! You did great!"

Grandma seemed really pleased.

"Well... I wish you would have kept it quiet... Anyway, I've become Sicily's boyfriend."

"Wow!"

Applause for some reason.

"We should celebrate right away! Dinner is already over today, so it will be tomorrow."

The head maid suggested.

Celebrate...?

"In that case, Shin, why don't you invite Sicily's parents as well?"

"Eh... me going to invite them?"

"Why not go together with Sicily to report your relationship and bring them here?"

It was getting more and more significant.

Sicily looked at me, wondering if it was okay.

"Shin..."

She looked at me with slightly moist eyes.

Oh, I've been absentmindedly stroking her head the whole time.

"Sicily, why don't we go tomorrow to announce our relationship to Cecil and Irene? What do you think?"

"Announce our relationship..."

She seemed embarrassed and buried her face in my chest.

Wow, what's this? She's super cute!

"This is amazing... you two are lovey-dovey as soon as you start dating."

"Well, they were like that even before they started dating. I wondered what would happen when they became a couple..."

"This is so mosaic!"

Who's the mosaic here?

"Well, anyway, congratulations. But we are in the middle of a crisis right now, so don't neglect your training because of your relationship."

"Yes, I understand!"

"In that case, why did you push for it now?"

Og then answered with a serious expression.

"Well, you see, in stories, characters who say something like, 'I'll confess after this battle' usually end up dead, right? So I thought it was better to do it before that."

Avoiding the death flag, huh!
