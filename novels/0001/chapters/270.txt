"Ultimate Magicians' New Recruit Examination.

Finally, the last exam is about to begin.

The exam venue was borrowed from the Arsheim Magician Corps training grounds.

Considering that we are going to conduct training for new members, it might be better to secure our own practice area.

We have that wilderness as our practice area, but it requires a gate to access, and it's not convenient for new members to practice independently.

Let's discuss this with Aug.

As we were contemplating this, Aug began a speech in front of the final exam candidates.

"Everyone, thank you for gathering. I am August, the Vice Chief of the Ultimate Magicians. We will now proceed with the final entrance examination for new recruits. The exam will consist of practical skills and an interview. First, we will start with the practical skills. I hope to see everyone demonstrate their abilities to the fullest."

With those brief words, he quickly stepped down.

Looking at the candidates... Oh, the Crown Prince of Arsheim just showed up out of nowhere, so he's incredibly nervous.

The people gathered here have been carefully selected through thorough background checks, so there are not many issues with their character, and there are no troublemakers.

Some look lacking in confidence and are hanging their heads, but most are approaching the exam with determined and serious expressions.

We conduct the practical skills test with such earnest candidates.

Unlike the entrance exam for the Advanced Magic Academy, where you use your best magic to the fullest, here, you will be asked to use various types of magic.

However, there is one condition.

Catalina, who guided the candidates to the practical test location, began to explain to the candidates.

"We will now conduct the practical skills test. In this test, you will use as many of your available magic spells as possible. Whether it's offensive magic, support magic, or healing magic, it doesn't matter. Please use all the magic you can."

With that explanation, the candidates looked bewildered, as if they had been caught off guard.

"However,"

Catalina continued her words to the candidates, and at that moment, their expressions changed from confusion to shock.

"There will be no incantations. You must perform the magic without any incantations."

Upon hearing those words, there was a commotion among the candidates.

"About the administrative staff, would it be better for Catalina and the others to decide?"

There's still a lot to do.

While contemplating these things as I looked at the documents evaluating the practical test, the break time quickly ended, and the interviews began.

The interview panel consists of me, Aug, and Catalina.

Henri is also here. Henri is our sales representative in the Ultimate Magicians and has a keen eye for people since she meets a lot of different people.

That's why she's participating in the interviews.

Catalina already has a top position in the administrative side, so her presence is expected.

The interviews began like this, and all the candidates were extremely tense.

Well, it's kind of like a job interview.

And it's the final test.

It's natural to feel nervous when your acceptance or rejection depends on how well you do.

So, I tried to be as considerate as possible to avoid making it too much of a high-pressure interview. But the guy sitting next to me...

"Why do you want to join us?"

"What is your specialty in magic?"

"What activities did you engage in during your school days?"

"What kind of work are you currently doing in your current position?"

Maybe it can't be helped because Aug is royalty, but he doesn't seem to care at all about how he asks questions.

It's not the content of the questions, but the way he asks them...

Every time the candidates are asked questions by Aug, they flinch, some even get teary-eyed.

As a result, the candidates leaving the room after the interview all looked exhausted.

"Sigh... You should be more careful with how you phrase things. What's the point of pressuring the candidates like that?"

I complained to Aug after the last candidate left.

"Hmm? Then you should have said something sooner if you had a problem. It's too late to say anything after it's all over."

I said that, and Aug made a dissatisfied face, but Henri opened her mouth to offer some support.

"Well, well. His Highness is royalty, and he's even the Crown Prince. I think he speaks in polite language to almost everyone he encounters, on par with kings from other countries. It can't be helped."

"That's right. In fact, it might be easier if we teach them about the hierarchical relationship from the beginning."

Following Henri's words, Catalina also supported Aug.

Well, it's more like the hierarchy...

But, well, for new members, that might be the case.

It's certainly easier to be feared than underestimated.

Aug then changed from an unsatisfied expression to a proud one.

"Hmph, you really understand it well. I am the Vice Chief of the Ultimate Magicians before I am royalty. I can't have my subordinates underestimate me. It's actually more convenient to be feared."

No, you definitely just thought about it after hearing Henri and Catalina.

As I gave Aug a sharp look, he pretended not to notice and focused on reviewing the candidates' documents.

"Now, with this, all the exams are over. Did anyone catch your eye?"

Aug said this and looked in our direction.

It seems the earlier conversation is over.

"Yes, that's right. We conducted background checks in advance, so there were no issues with their character."

"Their attitudes during the interview didn't raise any suspicions either, so I think it's okay."

Catalina and Henri answered while looking at the candidates' documents.

"I see. So, now the question is, how do we determine the accepted candidates?"

Aug said this while looking at me.

"After observing the practical test, I think these are the ones who should be fine for membership."

I said this after picking out a few candidates who seemed to be suitable after watching the practical test.

"Hmm. Is this group okay, then?"

"No, I think we should choose someone who showed particularly high ambition among those we interviewed."

I said this while looking at Henri.

And Henri, while examining the notes and documents she took during the interviews, had a serious expression on her face.

Then...

"Among those we interviewed, these two showed the highest ambition."

She said this and handed over the documents for two candidates.

After Aug and I looked at the documents, we nodded to each other.

"All right. Then, this year's new members of the Ultimate Magicians are these two."

And so, the first-ever Ultimate Magicians' new recruit examination came to an end, welcoming two new members.
