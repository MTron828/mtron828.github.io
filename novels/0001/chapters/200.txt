Two days after returning from visiting all the villages near the dragon habitat, we were called from the Min family's residence.

It seemed like Hao had returned. They wanted to conduct an investigation with us as well.

The ones summoned were us, the Ultimate Magicians, along with Shaolin and Lifan.

When we arrived at the Yuhuang Palace, we were led to a meeting room. However, there were no tables or chairs for us. So, we stood there waiting, and after a while, the door to the meeting room opened.

"------"

"------!! ------!?"

Entering the room were a military-looking person in more distinguished attire than the soldiers we had seen before and Hao, who was shouting something.

Hao had his hands restrained behind his back.

"Hey, what's Hao shouting about?"

"Well... He's saying things like 'Who do you think I am?' and 'This treatment is unacceptable,' I believe."

"Ugh... Do those higher-ups think they can get away with anything?"

"Isn't that how it usually is? Quite irritating."

Oh, it seems Shaolin was harsh, probably because she had been having a hard time with Hao until now.

"May we begin the questioning?"

The person who seemed to be a high-ranking military official asked politely.

He showed respect in his inquiries to us.

"We don't mind. What would you like to know?"

Answering on behalf of us was Aug.

Well, Aug is the Crown Prince, the future king of the Arlshyd Kingdom, after all. It wouldn't be suitable for someone else to answer instead of him.

So, we decided to let Aug handle this.

"Now, Your Highness, can you please tell us what you've witnessed?"

"Alright. We went to the village that was reported to have been attacked first..."

At that point, Aug paused, closed his eyes, shook his head, and took a deep breath. Then, he began to speak as if confessing something very painful.

"It was truly a horrifying sight. Buildings were destroyed, and human remains were scattered everywhere. It was like a scene from hell..."

Upon hearing those words, Hao immediately raised his voice.

"Impossible! When I arrived, there was no such situation!"

"And you say so?"

"On the contrary, let me ask you, when did Lord Hao arrive in that village?"

"It was the day after the report."

Upon hearing that, Aug chuckled slightly.

"Well, we have over a day since we defeated the dragon that was attacking the village. With that much time, they could have cleared away the bodies and resumed their activities."

"That's ridiculous! I marched without rest for a full day! There's no way they could have dealt with it so quickly!"

An angered Hao shouted, and the military official seemed triumphant.

"General! They're lying! This must prove that it's a plot to discredit me!"

Ah, he really was an important person, I see.

Being a general, he must hold quite a high position, maybe even the top one.

But more importantly, a lie? Oh, right, Hao probably doesn't know about that.

"A lie, you say. Your Highness, my apologies, but could you tell us how you traveled?"

"Understood."

"Roger."

With Aug's signal, I cast a levitation spell on "everyone" in the room.

"Oh, wow!"

"What!? What is this!?"

The general, who had been informed beforehand, looked interested, but Hao, who hadn't been told anything, was in a panic.

"In this state, using wind magic to move allows us to travel at speeds that surpass carriages. In fact, we arrived at that village just a few tens of minutes after leaving here."

"Wow, that's amazing!"

"Hey, lower me down!"

Upon Hao's request, I lowered everyone to the ground and released the levitation spell.

"Now, do you understand that we're not lying and that this is not a hoax?"

"Grr..."

As Aug said that, Hao gritted his teeth in frustration.

Well, that's why I cast the levitation spell on everyone. If only we had been floating, Hao would have accused us of cheating or some trickery.

But what if he experienced it himself?

He knows very well that his own body doesn't have any threads or the like to make him float.

If that happens, he won't have any grounds to deny us, and he'll have to acknowledge the truth.

That's what Aug explained in advance.

This guy is amazing, after all.

"Now, Your Highness, your words have been proven true. So, for the next question, did you think there were a small number of dragons?"

"No, quite the opposite. There were an overwhelming number of them. I've never seen so many dragons before."

"I see. However, Lord Hao previously reported a significant decline in the number of dragons, to the point of endangerment."

"If left as it was, the situation would have reversed, given the number we saw."

"Hmm... Min's family, did you see the dragons yourselves? Your Highness's report matches."

The general, this time, turned to Shaolin and Lifan for their responses.

"I didn't actually see them, but I confirmed the existence of individuals that had turned into monsters."

"Monsters?!"

Upon Shaolin's words, the general shouted in surprise.

"Is that true?! If it is, it's a big problem!"

He suddenly went from a composed demeanor to a state of urgency.

What's going on?

"Rest assured, General. The Ultimate Magicians here have already defeated the dragons that had turned into monsters."

"Why are you so agitated, General? Should you really trust the words of these unknown foreigners and commoners?"

Unknown foreigners and commoners?

You said this to a delegation from another country. I was thinking of giving him a piece of my mind, but instead, the general got furious.

"Silence! Dragons don't just transform into monsters so easily! You know as well as anyone that it's a rare occurrence that happens when their numbers have grown too high!"

"You! Who are you speaking to with that tone?!"

Upon hearing Hao's words, the general smirked.

"Well, well, for someone who hasn't realized their position at this stage."

"What do you mean?"

"This incident is already widely known among the citizens. The bill to ban dragon slaying is the one you had the false report created for and passed."

"No... Where's the evidence? Where is it?"

"Evidence, you say? In that case..."

The general signaled to someone nearby, and that person nodded and left the room.

After a while, that person returned with another man.

"What!? You!?"

"He was your aide, right? He provided all the testimony."

The man they brought in was Hao's aide.

I see, in that position, he probably knows a lot.

"Do you intend to believe the words of a scoundrel like him?"

"It's not just the testimony. There's concrete evidence as well."

The general said, receiving documents from another person.

"This is... It's the actual record of the number of individuals submitted by the investigation organization before you manipulated it."

"Why would you..."

"Of course, it's because he brought it with him."

"You traitor!"

Hao, betrayed by his aide, glared at him with a murderous intent.

He must be in shock from the betrayal of someone he trusted.

"Do you think you can defy me, a person like you?"

...I was wrong.

He's just furious that his pawn rebelled against him.

This guy is really despicable.

"General! Those documents are fabricated! They're not evidence of anything!"

"No, they are. Other officials have already confirmed it. This document is genuine."

"No..."

"There's much more. For example, the testimony of the investigation team's employees who were threatened with the consequences for their families if they spoke the truth."

"..."

"Hmph. You can look forward to the day of the trial. Hey, take him away."

The general said this, and Hao was led away by the soldiers.

We, who were watching the exchange between the general and Hao in astonishment, all turned to Aug.

Aug had a wry smile and shrugged his shoulders.

"I apologize. You had to witness that."

"No, it was quite interesting. Nevertheless, it seems that Hao is quite disliked."

"While there's no denying his competence, he has a habit of looking down on others. There isn't a single politician who doesn't harbor resentment towards him."

"Is that so, including you, General?"

When Aug said that, the general let out a heavy sigh.

"For instance, he threatens to cut the budget and imposes unreasonable demands. He probably thinks soldiers can just appear out of thin air."

"A typical proponent of the chosen people's ideology. He likely doesn't acknowledge those he deems inferior as humans. It's a wonder there haven't been any rebellions."

"Hao has his private troops. Although it seems that even his private troops have abandoned him in this case."

"Oh, really? What happened?"

"Just now, when we were heading to arrest Hao, he didn't resist but actually guided us to Hao's carriage."

"He actively lends a hand to arrest his master. I see, he's been abandoned."

Nevertheless, the general talking to Aug had a cheerful expression.

"He's been doing as he pleases for quite a while. It's time for him to face the consequences."

"I see, so those who will try to save him from now on..."

"Undoubtedly, there won't be any."

The general's face showed great delight as he said this.

Hao must be really despised.

Perhaps everyone was desperate to bring Hao down.

Then this situation occurred.

It seems there are no allies left for Hao.

"I'm relieved to hear that. By the way, what about that bill we discussed earlier?"

"Given the situation, it's undoubtedly going to be scrapped."

"I see. Then it seems negotiations can continue smoothly."

Aug said this with a sigh of relief.

Our main goal this time was to establish diplomatic relations with Kuang Long and obtain dragon leather, which is prohibited in our country. Well, it looks like the trade in magic stones might start as a byproduct.

...Although as a byproduct, it's on a rather large scale.

If these negotiations go well, it will bring about an immense transformation for Western countries, including Earlshide. Since Hao was the biggest obstacle regarding dragon leather, eliminating him is desirable for us.

For the people of Kuang Long, it's also a relief to have eliminated Hao, who wielded power.

For us, it's a win-win situation.

But only Hao is at a loss.

However, it's all the result of his own actions, so I don't feel any sympathy.

By the way, I asked the general about something.

"By the way, what will happen to Hao now?"

"Well, even after all that, he's still a high-ranking official in Kuang Long. He's under house arrest with surveillance placed on him, and then there will be a trial."

"I see."

For now, we have made progress in the negotiations.

Then I remembered something.

"Excuse me, may I ask something?"

"Yeah, what is it?"

"I heard a rumor that Hao had some incredible weapon..."

"Oh, yes, he indeed had one. We confiscated it when we arrested Hao."

"Is that so? Well, then..."

"Yeah?"

"Could I see that weapon, please?"

When I made this request, the general thought for a moment and then nodded.

"Alright, I'll show you. Follow me."

"Thank you."

I did it! Now I'll get to see what kind of weapon Hao had and learn about the technology of the ancient civilization.

With these thoughts in mind, I followed the general, who would guide me. with concepts
