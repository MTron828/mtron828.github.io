Princess Ellie, the wife of the Crown Prince, is pregnant.

The news spread throughout the kingdom, just like it did in Sicily.

The difference from Sicily is that Ellie is the wife of the Crown Prince.

In other words, she is carrying the next heir to the kingdom.

Despite being revered as a saint, Sicily, who married me, had a commoner's position.

Everyone celebrated, but Ellie's case was on a different scale.

The day after the news of Ellie's pregnancy was announced, the country declared a holiday.

Festivals were held all over, and people of all ages raised their glasses to Og and Ellie.

Unlike us, who only had celebration gifts, ambassadors from various countries came to the royal castle to offer their congratulations.

Everything about it was on a different scale from us.

"Ellie was a really important person, wasn't she?"

"Huh? Is it only occurring to you now?"

As I mumbled this while watching the commotion in the capital, Sicily looked surprised.

"The former duke's daughter, the current Crown Princess, and the future queen? She's a person in a unique position in the world, you know?"

"Well, when I see the Ellie who's usually with us..."

"Well... certainly, when she's with us, she's very approachable, but in social gatherings like evening parties and tea parties, her demeanor is so dignified that you wouldn't easily get close to her."

The dignified Ellie...

"Heh."

Sicily chuckled, unable to contain herself.

"I can guess what you're imagining, Shin-kun... but you're the same, you know?"

"Huh? Me?"

Wait a minute.

I've never given off a dignified and unapproachable vibe.

I tilted my head, and Sicily explained to me.

"A hero known for his strong friendship, his care for the people, his kindness, and his courage in saving the world. That's the general impression of you in society."

"Please stop..."

Whoa... it sends shivers down my spine!

Thanks to the book published by the Arlsheid royal family, my image has become something unbelievable.

When I read the second volume that even covered the showdown with Strom, I thought, "Who's this saint?"

When we all read the preview magazine before it was released, it caused even more laughter than the first volume.

Alice and Lynn, in particular, were laughing so hard they were convulsing.

Ellie enthusiastically agreed with Og's words and stretched herself out as much as she could.

"Well... in front of the castle's maids, I can't even do something like this. The only place where I can truly relax is here."

Ellie said this and slumped on the couch.

"I'm sorry, Shin. Can you let me rest for a while? I'll come to get her later," Og said.

"Of course."

With that, Og went back through the still-open gate.

Ellie, in her response, was completely off. Is this what they call a perfect noblewoman?

It seemed that it showed on her face because Ellie, who had been leaning deeply into the couch, sat up and glared at me.

"Hey, Shin, you're thinking of something rude again, aren't you?"

"How did you know!?"

"We've been friends for about three years now. I can understand your strange and eccentric thoughts!"

"Strange and eccentric..."

What era are you from?

"So? What rude thing were you thinking about?"

"Huh? Oh, I was just thinking I can't believe Ellie is a perfect noblewoman."

"That's really rude!"

Whoa, Ellie is really upset.

"Come on, Ellie, calm down. When you get too excited, it's not good for the baby in your belly, you know?"

"Phew... you're right. Thank you, Sicily."

"You're welcome."

"So, why were you thinking something like that?"

"Well, Sicily told me that Ellie is a perfect example of a lady. I've only seen the Ellie I know, who lounges on the couch like this and gets angry loudly, so I couldn't believe it."

When I said that, Ellie looked a bit embarrassed.

"I-it's not my fault. I've been seen as a duke's daughter and Og's fianc√©e since I was a child. I couldn't afford to show my true self and give an opening to the noble daughters who haven't given up on being Og's wife or their families. Even if I show my true self, there are no problems or judgments here. That's why I'm on your side."

"Is that so?"

"Yes, it is."

Is that so?

It must be tough being the future wife of the Crown Prince.

"In the first place, His Majesty also frequents this place, does he not? The Wolford family is, in a sense, a sanctuary for the Arlsheid royal family."

"Don't just make our place a sanctuary, seriously."

"Huh? Oh! Lady Merida!? I'm terribly sorry!"

Oh, here comes the Grandma-Goddess again.

"Huh!?"

"I didn't say anything!"

Did my expression give it away again? Can they really tell just by looking at my face?

"Honestly, this child... Oh, it's just a joke, so don't be so apologetic. Sit down and rest."

"Yes, I apologize."

Ellie said this and gracefully sat back down on the couch.

"Hmm..."

Seeing her like this, Sicily's words might not be entirely untrue.

"...Did you think of something strange just now?"

"That's why... Why..."

"I can pretty much guess what you're thinking, Shin."

"Hehe, ahaha."

Sicily, who had been observing our exchange, chuckled.

"It's not a laughing matter, Sicily. My husband is looking at his friend's wife strangely, you know? You should rein it in a bit."

"Hehe, sorry. But, Shin, your strange looks are quite literal, right?"

"So, I'm telling you to stop it!"

"Alright, calm down. It's not good for the baby."

"Seriously! This couple..."

"Are you okay, Ellie?"

Ellie seemed a little queasy, so she took a sip of the orange juice that one of our maids had prepared.

"Phew, I'm fine now. I've calmed down."

"Huff... Ellie, it seems like you're having a rough time with morning sickness."

"Yes, well, you see, even the slightest sign of discomfort causes a commotion around me, so I can't relax."

"Being the Crown Princess is tough, isn't it?"

Indeed, she's carrying the future of the Arlsheid royal family in her belly.

So, there's a lot of fuss.

"By the way, how is the other pregnant lady doing?"

The Grandma-Goddess, who had been observing Sicily and Ellie's conversation, asked about the other person who wasn't here.

"Speaking of which, Olivia seems to be having a hard time."

I had heard about Olivia's condition a little while ago from Mark.

"What do you mean by 'having a hard time'?"

"Apparently, when they were at Mark's house, the noise from the factory was bothering her, but if she went back to her parents' place, it's all about the kitchen, and the smell makes her nauseous."

"Huh? It must be really tough!"

"So, she ended up renting a quiet room. Mark and Olivia's mother take turns taking care of her."

Once the child is born, they plan to return to Mark's house, but until then, they're living as a couple.

"Well, that's too bad."

Grandma expressed sympathy for Olivia, but it seemed like it wasn't so bad after all.

According to what Mark said, both Mark's and Olivia's homes have many craftsmen and shop employees, and it's noisy. He mentioned that their current life is peaceful and quiet.

Living in a noisy house means they can't be lovey-dovey, even though they are newlyweds.

"What's with that? You worried for nothing."

She had looked sympathetic a moment ago, but now that she realized it wasn't so bad, Grandma had an exasperated expression.

"Hehe, in that regard, we're fortunate. The staff members here don't make unnecessary noise, and, above all, we have the grandmother, who is a parenting veteran."

"Well, we don't have anyone in our house who makes a big fuss, and it's calm..."

While Grandma, who blushed at Sicily's compliments, was saying this, my wireless communicator rang.

This is...

"Yes, this is Shin. Ah, I see. What? Again? Alright, I understand."

After saying that, I hung up and immediately opened the gate.

"Um... could it be?"

"That's right."

I answered Sicily's question with a wry smile, and even though I hadn't gone to pick them up, the person from the recent call came through the gate from the other side.

"Huff, I'm tired. Ah, can I get some tea?"

The person who asked Marika, who was waiting by the gate, for tea as soon as they came out. It was...

"Of course, Your Holiness."

It was Ekaterina.

"Oh, Princess Elizabeth is here too. How are you feeling?"

"I-I'm doing well, thank you!"

"Oh, I see. And Sicily?"

"She's doing fine."

"I see. Hehe, I'm glad everything seems to be going well."

Ekaterina said with a smile, elegantly took a seat on the sofa, and...

"What do you mean by 'I'm glad everything seems to be going well'? You were here yesterday too, weren't you?"

Grandma gave her a little lecture.

"Huh? That's fine. This is the most relaxing place for me."

"Well... both you and Disithium, why do you use our home as a refuge?"

"Oh, I'm sorry."

"Oh, Ellie is fine. She's pregnant, after all. She needs a place to relax."

"Huh? You're playing favorites, Master!"

"You're not a child, talking about playing favorites at your age!"

"Grr!"

"Hehe..."

Ekaterina, when she's here, behaves like a child. Well, that's probably because she feels comfortable around Grandma.

"But still, it was such a calm atmosphere until a moment ago, but it got noisy as soon as you arrived."

"What do you mean by that?!"

"I mean it just as I said!"

A rare stand-up comedy featuring a mentor and the Archbishop of the Creation God's Church in a household. Is this really a place for peace of mind?

"Y-Your Holiness being here... it's unsettling."

It sure is.orm content ideas
