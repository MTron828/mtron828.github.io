While Shin was preparing magic for dealing with Strom, August and the other members of the Ultimate Magicians had been devising various strategies to counter the demons. In a recent battle against Strom's underlings, they had reached a stalemate, unable to break through the demons' offense and defense. Despite being celebrated as heroes and genius magicians by the public, they felt utterly useless on the actual frontlines.

August and his companions never considered themselves geniuses and were well aware that they had gained their strength thanks to Shin. The fact that they had been saved by Shin in critical situations left them with deep feelings of regret. They didn't think too highly of themselves as saviors of the world, but they had let down the expectations placed upon them.

This led August and the others to dedicate themselves to individual training for the impending final battle against the demons. On that day, August was practicing magic in the usual wilderness when Thor and Julius arrived.

Nobody dared to comment on the fact that the crown prince had no bodyguards. In this country, and perhaps in the world, no one was powerful enough to suggest that the second strongest person should have bodyguards.

"Your Highness, how are you feeling?"

"Ah, Thor. Well, I'd say it's mostly complete."

"As expected of you, Your Highness."

"What about you two? Have you devised any strategies?"

In response to August's question, Thor and Julius exchanged glances before answering.

"We're not as skilled as you, Your Highness, so we've decided to team up."

"Indeed, there's no point in worrying about appearances at this stage. Facing multiple enemies alone would be foolish."

Upon hearing their response, August let out a small, amused chuckle.

"In this battle, we absolutely must emerge victorious."

August then expanded his own magic.

"Oh, that's quite impressive, Your Highness."

"Most impressive."

"Yes, thank you."

Given their past interactions, August had never expected Thor and Julius to praise him insincerely. He accepted their compliments graciously.

"Now, I wonder how everyone else is progressing with their strategies?"

"I'm more concerned about Shin-dono's trump card."

"Indeed, I am as well."

August was aware that the others were working on strategies, but Thor and Julius expressed greater concern about Shin's secret plan. Upon hearing this, August fell into deep thought.

"Come to think of it, when Hughes proposed using long-range and extremely powerful magic for mass destruction, he mentioned that it could be done..."

"Changing the landscape..."

"And rendering it uninhabitable for humans," they said.

After reaching that point, the three exchanged glances in silence.

"I'm starting to get really worried."

"His remarks may suggest he's learned some restraint..."

"But it's still Shin-dono..."

They all remembered Shin's recent slip.

They wanted to believe, but August and the others couldn't shake their unease.

"Father, I have a request."

"What is it? Tony, are you really coming to me for a favor now?"

"Well, things have changed. I've surpassed you in earnings and status."

"You..."

"Ahaha... I'm not asking you for pocket money or anything like that."

"So, what do you want?"

"I want you to... train me."

In Tony's residence within the capital, Tony made a request for training to his father, who was an active knight.

"Training? Sword training, right? Why now?"

"Yeah, I know, it may seem strange. I chose the Magic Academy..."

"Oh, no. I worded that poorly. You've already become an extraordinary wizard with remarkable magical abilities. If you've excelled in magic to that extent, I won't object. But why do you want to resume sword training?"

Tony looked disgruntled and muttered, "Because my magic doesn't work on certain opponents."

Seeing Tony's expression, his father began to understand.

"...Another demon?"

"Yes. The demons we defeated before were all former commoners who had no combat skills. However, the new demon that emerged..."

"A battle-hardened former soldier?"

"Exactly. Thanks to that, we were all at the mercy of the demons during that battle. If Shin hadn't arrived in time, we would have been in grave danger."

"Is that so..."

Tony, who had involuntarily enrolled in the Magic Academy against his own wishes, felt that his father was somewhat uninterested in him. As a result, their conversations at home naturally decreased over time. This resulted in Tony not sharing the details of his experiences during the past demon territory liberation operation and the recent conflicts near the magic capital.

Tony's father was aware of the fact that his son had faced life-threatening situations and appeared to be somewhat shocked.

"So, they decided that things can't continue like this, and they got a message from His Highness that everyone needs to be able to stand against demons."

"Wait, it's His Highness' order!?"

"Huh? Well, it's not that grand. It's more like confirming what we need to do."

"Not that grand, you say..."

The Crown Prince of the great Arlsheid Kingdom. August was considered an unparalleled genius with an exceptional mind and extraordinary magical abilities. Tony, his son, didn't consider it a big deal. Tony's father found himself exasperated.

"...There are many things I want to say, but not now. Anyway, it's His Highness' order. I'll train you with all I've got. Come!"

With these words, Tony's father went out to the backyard of the house.

"Ugh... I hate this sweaty stuff..."

Even though he had volunteered for this, Tony couldn't help but dislike it.

Several hours later...

"That's enough for today!"

"Th-thank you..."

Tony's father was overjoyed to have been able to train his son after a long time, and Tony was completely exhausted.

Tony's mother went to assist Tony as she looked at her beaten-up son.

"Are you okay, Tony?"

"Yeah, I'm fine, Mom."

"But really... you got quite a beating there, my hero."

Seeing her son in such a state, his mother looked more delighted than worried.

Watching his ever-enthusiastic mother, Tony gave a wry smile.

"Well, I owe it to magic. I've only been using a sword against monsters lately."

"True, but I still have my doubts about that strategy..."

His mother, who was a former knight, seemed dissatisfied with the tactics demonstrated during the training with his father.

Sensing her concerns, Tony tried to reassure her.

"Mom, this upcoming battle is not about playing fair or being underhanded, following the righteous path or the wicked path. It's just about 'winning or losing.' That's all that matters."

"Well, it might be true, but..."

In the ears of his mother, who still seemed somewhat dissatisfied, Tony's mutterings reached her.

"I won't be a burden anymore..."

With a determined expression despite being beaten up, Tony muttered these words.

Observing her son's determination from his profile, Tony's mother decided not to push the matter further and changed the subject.

"Oh, right. Tony, bring Lilia next time."

"Mom? Why are you suddenly talking about that!?"

"Why not? I've got some free time while you're training with your father."

"Just because of that..."

"How about we cook together with Lilia or share some stories from your past?"

The previously serious atmosphere quickly dissipated, and Tony was left disheartened by his mother's enthusiasm for what to do with his girlfriend.

"Yuri, is this okay?"

"Yay, thanks!"

"What's the matter? It's just fine."

In the capital of the Arlsheid Kingdom, there was a workshop known as the "Bean Workshop" that was immensely popular among hunters. Recently, it had rapidly increased its sales as the exclusive workshop of the Wolforde Trading Company, led by Shin. It was a workshop that was on a roll, making money like there was no tomorrow.

With the substantial increase in production, the Bean Workshop had hired a significant number of craftsmen and enchanters, along with numerous part-time workers. Among the Ultimate Magicians, Yuri excelled at enchantment magic second only to Shin and was at the pinnacle of enchanters. She was taking lessons from Merida, who was also skilled in enchantment magic and working part-time at the Bean Workshop.

By hiring Yuri, an excellent enchanter, the workshop was able to expand its production. Yuri, on the other hand, could practice enchantment magic practically by applying it in large quantities. It had become a win-win situation.

The workshop primarily focused on metalworking, and most of the craftsmen were rugged men. In this setting, the seductive aura Yuri exuded, which didn't match her sixteen years of age, along with her enchantment magic skills, made her incredibly popular among the workshop's craftsmen. The craftsmen knew that Yuri wanted to create new offensive magical tools for the fight against the demons, so they had prepared a large number of short staff-shaped magical instruments for her.

"Um, this one gets this enchantment, and this one here..."

"But, Yuri, is all of this really necessary?"

"Yeah, it's necessary... it won't work against those demons without it..."

Yuri was more skilled in enchantment magic than attack magic, and she had not been very effective in the previous battle against the demons. At that time, she deeply regretted not having a greater variety of offensive magical tools.

"I don't want to have any more regrets..."

Yuri usually had a relaxed demeanor, but thinking about the previous battle seemed to make her somewhat remorseful.

The experienced craftsmen watched Yuri with admiration, as if they were looking after a determined daughter. The younger craftsmen respected her with admiring gazes.

"I'm done!"

With many short staff-shaped magical instruments, Yuri had finished enchanting them, while the craftsmen watched over her.

"I'd like to test them somewhere."

"If that's the case, you can use our testing grounds."

"Really? Is that okay?"

"Yeah, no problem with you, Yuri."

"In that case, I'd like to take you up on your offer."

Thanks to the intervention of the older craftsmen, Yuri was granted permission to test her magical instruments in the newly established testing grounds. Many craftsmen were curious, so they accompanied her to watch the test.

"Why are you all lining up here like a bunch of geese?" The workshop owner, Harold, questioned the craftsmen who had gathered, but the craftsmen had their reasons.

"We heard that Yuri wants to test some offensive magical tools, so we came here to supervise."

"What's your real reason?"

"Well, we are curious, you know? Yuri, who is considered the successor to Master, the Ultimate Magicians' Yuri. What kind of attack magic did she enchant?"

"Fair enough, I guess."

In the end, Harold became curious as well, and he reluctantly permitted the craftsmen to observe Yuri's test.

"Alright, here we go."

With her usual nonchalant spirit, Yuri activated the magical instruments she had enchanted. Then, she began to release attack magic that hit the targets in the testing grounds one after another.

From fire and wind to water, lightning, and earth, all kinds of magic were unleashed with tremendous power from the magical instruments. The craftsmen in the workshop watched in awe as the attack magic was released from the magical tools.

They were producing magical tools like they had never seen before, all at the request of Shin.

Their reputation was so high that it wasn't an exaggeration to say they were the best in the entire capital of Earlshide.

Despite being craftsmen, witnessing the Ultimate Magicians' attack magic directly was a first for many of them. The attack magic was so powerful that it left the craftsmen in stunned silence.

"Hmm, is this stuff okay?"

Yuri herself didn't seem entirely satisfied.

"Wasn't Yuri-chan supposed to be weak in attack magic?"

"Yeah, compared to folks like Wolford-kun, it's nothing."

Yuri said while checking the magical tools after firing her magic.

"Wow, the magical tools made by you guys are really amazing. With these, I might be able to handle things."

Yuri seemed satisfied as she examined the magical tools that showed no signs of damage, even after casting powerful magic.

The craftsmen watching her, however, couldn't help but feel amazed.

"Yuri-chan is also one of the Ultimate Magicians..."

Yuri herself realized that she was becoming quite an extraordinary figure.
