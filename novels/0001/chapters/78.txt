"Wow. It seems there are tigers again at Oug's place."

"Yeah. Why do tigers always appear at my place...?"

After the first day of the Demon Realm conquest operation, they set up their camp, processed the avoidance of monsters as they did yesterday, and held a briefing before going to sleep.

It appears that tigers have appeared at Oug's place.

"However, Oug's tiger hunting count is quite something. Maybe we should bestow the title of 'Tiger-Hunting Prince'?"

"Guh! I knew someone would say that..."

"Rather than that, I received an interesting title."

"An interesting title?"

"Hey, Julius! Wait!"

"From the soldiers who saw His Highness's magic, they called him the 'Thunder God.'"

"Thor!? You too!?"

Do all betrayed people react the same way?

While saying a line that sounded familiar from somewhere, Oug was unusually flustered.

Anyway, it seems Oug has received a title as well.

However...

"'Thunder God'... That's pretty cool, isn't it?"

"Yeah. I thought I'd be made fun of, to be honest."

I think it's better than the King of Mages = Demon King.

"I wish they had given me a title like 'Wind God.'"

It seems Maria was also envious of Oug being called the Thunder God.

"How long are they going to keep calling me a 'Valkyrie'...?"

Is that it?

I think it'll be fine... I don't think they're calling us Valkyries in that sense.

"We didn't have any Disaster-class monsters on our side."

"Really? Alice."

"Yeah. There were plenty of monsters, though. I thought if there were no Disaster-class monsters, there'd be no role for me, so I volunteered for combat."

"Come on, each country has to subdue the monsters. You didn't go for extermination, did you?"

The reason this operation is being carried out with the participation of people from all over the world is to make it look like everyone in the world protected the world to ensure that only Earlshide doesn't win too much.

In the context of this operation, the role of each country's military is to subdue the monsters.

The threat to the world is not just the demons alone.

Monsters that are intentionally increased by the appearance of Strom also become a significant threat.

Thinning out that threat significantly is the true mission of the military forces of each country.

"I saw it too, so there's no mistake."

Mark and Olivia said they saw it too.

But even if it's large, to be classified as a Disaster-class?

"Why would a deer be classified as a Disaster-class?"

"Well... I've never heard of it. Becoming large is already quite unusual. Let alone being classified as a Disaster-class..."

"First time hearing about it..."

"But, you know, we had wolves classified as Disaster-class in our area. According to Shin's account, it's rare, but not unheard of..."

Wolf monsters start out as medium-sized creatures. However, for some reason, there have been reports of wolves reaching Disaster-class in the past. Is it because they're carnivores? Or is it because they're naturally intelligent animals?

"What? A Disaster-class wolf appeared in Shin's area!?"

"Yeah, I was just about to report it... What's wrong?"

"What's wrong with you... When a wolf monster reaches Disaster-class, I've heard it's more troublesome than tigers or lions due to their cunning. Are you sure everything's fine?"

"As usual, Shin took them down instantly."

"I see... So there were no particular issues?"

It's quite rare for Oug to be concerned about me.

Truly unusual.

"Don't worry, I'm fine. Actually, it was weaker than the wolf monsters we defeated before, so it was kind of anticlimactic."

"...I see. So it's all right, then?"

"What's with you? Were you that worried?"

"Well, I'm not worried about you... But still, a Disaster-class wolf appears, and a deer that was never expected to become a Disaster-class does..."

"Leaving aside Oug's unusually heartless response, it is indeed quite intriguing."

"The extermination itself is going well, but something bothers me..."

"Yeah, after I defeated the wolf monster, I had a similar thought. Maybe..."

"Is it related to Strom?"

"I wonder? In the current Demon Realm, there's an abundance of monsters, making it easier for animals to transform into monsters..."

This overflow of monsters is unprecedented, and we can't predict what kind of irregularities might occur.

However, Strom has a history of artificially increasing the number of demons and forcibly turning animals into monsters.

We shouldn't rule out the possibility that he has done something.

But if that's the case...

"I wonder what's happening with Earlshide? Even though the Magic Corps and Knights have increased their forces, if there's a possibility that Strom is doing something, it might become a bit problematic."

In this operation, the Earlshide army did not assign us, the Ultimate Magicians. The reason is that Earlshide is a major power and can field several times the number of troops as the surrounding countries.

The Magic Corps improved their strength through Grandpa's training methods. The Knights also increased their forces compared to other countries by quickly adopting jet boots.

The role of this "military" in this operation is monster subjugation. Up to Disaster-class monsters can be dealt with using new equipment and the power of new magic, and that's why they hesitated to seek our assistance.

They didn't anticipate a battle with the demons because it's been several months since the previous attack, and somewhere... they are expecting this operation to be in the former imperial capital, but the possibility of them lurking there was high, and it was unimaginable that they would be wandering within the Demon Realm.

And above all, Earlshide's intention was to not keep us as their own military force.

However, if Strom has done something, it suddenly becomes worrisome.

"Regular communication troops haven't returned yet. It's the Demon Realm, and the work team that was supposed to set up communication lines may have moved far away."

"I'm worried... yeah."

"It's certainly concerning, but the fact that they don't need our help is something we initiated. If they involve us, they will prioritize assigning us to neighboring countries and other major powers."

Originally, the Earlshide army should be able to handle this problem on their own. Involving the surrounding countries and other major powers is to prevent Earlshide from having it all their way and to maintain power balance. So, because of these circumstances, the decision to prevent any harm to the neighboring countries was also the reason we were not assigned to the Earlshide army.

"If there's no issue with Earlshide, the operation itself seems to be going well."

"...For now, let's wait for the report."

In a situation like this, we should have provided wireless communication devices to the Earlshide army as well... But there aren't enough channels, and it might be seen as special treatment...

As for Earlshide, we'll wait for their regular report, and the situation in the country where we have been dispatched is that unexpected monsters have appeared, but the operation itself is progressing smoothly, so we concluded the regular report.

Afterward, the soldiers who had received regular reports from the various allied forces through the communication devices returned, and upon hearing their reports, they broke into a cold sweat.

"S-Sai turned into a monster!?"

"A-And then? What happened!?"

Maria seemed more desperate than usual.

It was only natural to assume that monsters that were previously not thought to turn into Disaster-class ones in the Earlshide army, where we weren't present, would naturally become so.

The conversation with Oug had suddenly made me concerned about the Earlshide army.

"They say that the Magic Corps immobilized it with their magic, and the Knights delivered the final blow. Apparently, the one who delivered the final blow was a student from the Knight Academy."

I see... It's the first time they reported a monster becoming a Disaster-class, but they managed to deal with it.

With their new training methods and equipment, the Earlshide army had truly become stronger.

"What's the name of that student? Do you know the name?"

"Uh, well... Oh, it's Miranda. She was a female student named Miranda Walres."

"Miranda..."

Miranda, that's right. Wasn't she the second-ranked girl from the Knight Academy?

"Is Miranda okay?"

"Yes, after defeating the Disaster-class monster, she apparently exhausted her strength and collapsed, but she's safe. And because her tactics were very effective, she asked us to implement them as well."

"I see..."

Upon hearing this, Maria sat down with a disappointed look.

"Why is Maria so concerned about Miranda?"

"She's a friend."

"Huh? Really?"

Surprising. When did that happen?

"After the joint training, they strangely got along well. Since Sicily started hanging out at Shin's house all the time, Miranda and I spent more time together."

"I see..."

Sicily seems complicated. Her lifelong friend made friends in places she didn't know about. But since she was always at my house, she can't really say anything. Still, she doesn't seem too pleased about it.

"It seems the Holy Maiden's relatives are safe too."

"I see... Thank you."

Sicily's sisters are also part of the Magic Corps, so they are participating in this operation.

The soldiers kindly informed me, but what's with that? I feel relieved, but it's not like I'm particularly delighted.

"Well, considering it's a Disaster-class opponent, there seems to have been some damage... As expected of the Earlshide army. They managed to stop it with this much damage."

Damage... The word made my heart race. Does that mean there were casualties?

"I see... Thank you for the report. Is the operation progressing smoothly?"

"Yes! Thanks to all of you, the Ultimate Magicians, it's going extremely well. Even without your assistance, the Earlshide army is doing quite well."

"I see. Thank you. Well then, we're done here."

"Yes. Thank you for your hard work."

We bid farewell to the soldier who had provided the report and returned to our tent. While walking back, it seemed I had a somber expression, as Sicily quietly looped her arm through mine.

"...Shin, you seem troubled."

"...Do you think so?"

"Yes... It's because there were casualties, right?"

She saw right through me...

"I can't help but wonder if having someone from our group in the Earlshide army would have prevented casualties..."

"But this was a decision made by His Highness, Your Majesty, and the Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau. The Earlshide army has increased its forces compared to other countries, so it was decided that our assistance should be directed to other nations."

"I understand, but..."

"Besides, Sylvia and the others mentioned it."

"Sylvia and the others?"

"They came back to visit before joining the operation... They said it might be their last visit..."

"Huh?"

Does that mean they came to say their final goodbyes?

"Sylvia and the others were prepared for this. They knew they might lose their lives in this operation, but they felt honored to risk their lives for the sake of the people. That's what they said."

"...I see."

In reality, if given enough time, we could have likely resolved the issue on our own. Our decision to involve everyone quickly for the sake of the people, the need for an early resolution, the strategy of surrounding them before attacking to prevent escape, and the world's power balance—these were, in a way, our self-indulgences.

In contrast, soldiers from various countries were participating in this operation, risking their lives. I was... making them put their lives on the line.

"Am I... making everyone do something cruel?"

"Sylvia said that too."

As I pondered whether I was forcing everyone to risk their lives, Sicily spoke.

"Normally, we adults should be the ones solving these problems, and it's regrettable that we have to rely on you. They think it's frustrating and feel inadequate. They want to do what they can on their own."

"..."

"So, Shin, you don't need to feel guilty. Everyone wants to overcome this crisis and protect their world's peace with their own strength."

I might have become arrogant without realizing it. I've been thinking that without us, the Disaster-class and the demons couldn't be defeated. I haven't been considering that everyone wants to protect their world's peace with their own efforts.

"I might have unconsciously become too high-handed... thinking that we're the only ones who can save the world from this crisis."

I said somewhat self-mockingly, and Sicily, who had been holding my arm, let go and hugged me directly.

"Shin, you are still the hope of the world. You are the only one who can confront Schtrom. So... don't belittle yourself so much."

"Sicily..."

"Everyone wants to save the world too. They're prepared to make sacrifices for that purpose. So... don't blame yourself too much."

As she held me and said these words, Sicily's body was trembling slightly.

No matter how prepared they are, there must be fear of losing loved ones. Nevertheless, everyone is fighting despite this fear, and their families probably sent them off with the same determination.

"I'm sorry... Thank you... I feel pathetic... I..."

"That's not true. Shin, your family... your grandfather and grandmother, they aren't in the military, so you haven't had that experience, have you? But those of us with family members in the military have already made that determination. It's just that difference."

I see. Sicily's family members are part of the Military Division despite her calm appearance. She had already made that determination.

"I'm the same, Shin. We don't have family members in the military, so... I panicked, worrying that something might have happened to Miranda."

Maria, who hadn't entered the conversation until now, spoke up. So Maria felt the same way.

"Sicily, you're amazing. I didn't know you had already made that determination."

"...Even though I've made that determination, I'm still scared, of course."

Sicily and Maria, still holding me, continued their conversation.

...It's an odd scene.

"Yeah... I understand that everyone is prepared. But I'll do my best to minimize those sacrifices."

"Yes, let's do our best."

Saying that, Sicily smiled warmly.

"...I've been saved by Sicily again."

"I told you, didn't I? It's my job to heal your heart."

"Yeah... Thank you..."

"Oh..."

I couldn't help it. Sicily's words made me so happy that I ended up hugging her tightly.

"Sicily..."

"Shin..."

"You two... don't just ignore me...!"

"Ah!"

Maria was visibly trembling.

While Shin and his group were receiving reports from the Arlsheid army, August and his group were also receiving reports.

"I see... They defeated a Disaster-class with few casualties..."

"Yes. If it weren't for the Arlsheid army, the casualties would have been much higher. They're impressive."

Kurt's soldier said that, but August's expression remained stern.

"I understand. Thank you for the report."

"Yes! Then I'll be going."

Saying that, Kurt's soldier left.

Once the soldier was out of sight, August muttered softly.

"Casualties... huh."

"...Are you okay, Your Highness?"

"Yeah. I'm fine."

August briefly wore a pained expression, but he quickly regained his composure.

"I sent the soldiers to fight the Disaster-class; it was my decision. Both the soldiers and I were prepared for this."

He felt responsible for his own orders. Even if he didn't directly command them, as a member of the royal family, he believed he couldn't escape the responsibility.

However, he still felt the weight of that responsibility, and as a sixteen-year-old, he wasn't entirely prepared for it.

Seeing August in this state, Thorl brought up the topic he had been curious about.

"By the way, Your Highness, during your conversation with Lord Shin earlier, it seemed like you wanted to say something. You also seemed like you were going to say something at Darm Cathedral the other day."

"Oh... well, the operation seems to be going smoothly, so I didn't think I had to say anything special. I just decided not to bring it up earlier."

Earlier, August had spoken in a way that suggested concern for Shin.

As someone who had witnessed Shin's extraordinary abilities up close on a regular basis, August didn't harbor any doubts about him when it came to monster extermination.

So, what could be the reason for August's concern?

"Well, it seems there was someone at the recent Cabinet meeting who opposed Shin's participation in the operation."

"Ah, you mean the representative from Dahm, right? The minutes of the meeting were made public. What's the issue with that?"

"Well... I thought they might take actions to hinder the extermination. It seems my concerns were unfounded."

"Hinder the extermination? They wouldn't do something like that, would they?"

"I don't know. Dahm has many devout followers of the Creator Faith due to its history. The representative is probably one of those devout believers."

"Why do you think that would make them obstructive?"

Julius found it curious that someone who was a devout believer in their faith would obstruct the mission, thinking that a person deeply devoted to the faith would not hinder someone referred to as God's Messenger.

"It's precisely because they're devout believers. The fact that they opposed Shin's participation in the operation may indicate that they don't hold Shin in high regard. Perhaps it's because Shin, who is not a follower of the Creator Faith, being called a Messenger of God doesn't sit well with them."

"Even with the world facing this crisis...?"

"It might not matter to them. If devotion goes too far... and I apologize for the wording, but they may have become fanatical to the point that they no longer see what's happening around them."

August's words were worryingly plausible, and Thorl and Julius exchanged glances.

"With the abnormal situation regarding the monsters, and to have someone like that among their own family..."

"In that case, why was Lord Shin assigned to the Dahm Allied Forces? Wouldn't it have been better to assign him to another Allied Forces?"

Julius had his doubts if there was a potential for Shin to interfere. Why not assign him elsewhere?

"It's because it's Shin. I didn't think he would be bothered by minor obstacles like that. In fact, I was worried whether others would be able to handle irregular situations."

"If we trust Lord Shin..."

"Despite his casual personality, there's no doubt about his abilities."

Ignoring Thorl's warm gaze, August continued.

"However, the operation is going well, and there haven't been any issues even when Shin defeated a Disaster-class. That's why I said my concerns were unfounded."

"I see."

"Oh, I hope the operation continues without any further incidents," August wished.

Whether or not August's wish was heard, the campaign to conquer the Demon Territory continued smoothly from that point on.

Special Disaster-class monsters that had previously appeared in various allied forces did not reappear, and the soldiers were adequately equipped to handle any potential threats. Even if a Disaster-class did appear occasionally, Shin and the Earlshide Army, which had adopted the Jump Thrust, could swiftly defeat them without traumatizing the soldiers.

It was a grand march to exterminate the monsters. While there were casualties due to the unusually high number of monsters in the Demon Territory, the primary goal of this operation, which was for Shin and the others to confront the demons and Disaster-class creatures, proceeded smoothly. The other military units focused on eliminating the remaining monsters.

In the midst of all this, the Kurt Allied Forces reported shocking news. They had discovered that demons were congregating in a town on the way to the former Imperial Capital. debug
