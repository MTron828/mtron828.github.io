"Hey, Sicily."

"Yes, what is it?"

"...Isn't August too cool?"

What's with that, being the pride of humanity's protectors? It's like being a hero saving the world. I'd like to say such cheesy lines too!

"Haha... But, that's how we used to know His Highness. I've gotten used to His Highness now, but before, that was the image."

"Hmm... I've heard such stories a few times, but it still feels strange."

"Shin only knows the current His Highness."

At first, everyone felt a bit uncomfortable with the current August, but he was always like that in front of me. It's those kinds of cheesy things that make you feel he's truly a prince.

And so, when I was having that conversation with Sicily...

"Ahh!"

"Ah! Alice!!"

Alice, who had been successfully defeating demons with Rin until just now, seemed to have neglected her footing while concentrating on her attacks. She stumbled and fell on the ground, which had been battered by the intense magical battle. Unfortunately, at that moment, a demon's magic flew her way.

"Nyaaaah!"

Alice managed to deploy the defensive magic integrated into her magical girl-style outfit, but it couldn't completely nullify the attack, and she was blown away.

Ah, darn it! Got carried away and let my guard down, didn't I? Falling unexpectedly and not being able to activate magical tools instantly in that situation. It seems like I managed to nullify some of the damage, but I can tell that I've taken quite a hit even though we're apart.

"I'm going!"

Seeing Alice receive damage just like she did, Sicily immediately used a gate to reach Alice's location.

"Ugh..."

"I got it!"

"I won't let you!"

The magic the demon cast in an attempt to finish off Alice was blocked by Sicily's magical barrier, which just barely arrived in time.

"What the hell?! Where did you come from!?"

"Miss Rin, provide support!"

"I know!"

"Ugh! Dammit!"

While the demon was taken aback by Sicily's sudden appearance through the gate, Rin distracted the demon.

They successfully separated from Sicily and the others.

"Are you okay?! Alice!"

Sicily, after confirming that the demons had moved away, immediately attended to Alice's treatment.

"Ugh... Sorry, Sicily. I let my guard down."

"Well, even though your tactics were working smoothly for quick elimination... they're still demons. If you don't activate your bestowed magic in time, you could have died from that last attack."

"Yeah, I realized that. These guys are definitely different from the demons we've encountered before."

"Yes, you're fine now."

"Wow, I'm already healed! Thanks, Sicily!"

After finishing her treatment, Alice leaped toward the demon that had injured her.

"You there! You've got some nerve!"

"Huh?! You're already healed!?"

"Our healing magic is top-notch!"

"Isn't that way beyond common sense?"

"Of course, I received training from Walford-kun."

"Huh?!"

The demon was so taken aback by Alice's quick recovery that Rin was able to flank them without being noticed.

"Damn..."

"Too slow."

"Argh... Aghh!"

"You're forgetting about me!"

In their haste to defend against Rin's magic, the demon neglected Alice. The demon took Alice's magic head-on and crumbled to the ground.

"Darn... Double-teaming is... unfair..."

"We won't get our priorities wrong."

As the demon muttered complaints while lying defeated, Rin cast a finishing spell.

The top priority is to defeat the demons by any means necessary and save the world. It seems like everyone understands August's intentions well.

"Nevertheless..."

"What's wrong, Sicily?"

After finishing Alice's treatment and returning to my side, Sicily mumbled quietly.

"Did the demons ever expect to be in such a disadvantaged position?"

"Well, I suppose not."

Thinking back to their previous battles, it's understandable. The earlier battle reached a stalemate due to the lack of a decisive factor. Few demons were present in that situation, and I ended up defeating most of them, but some managed to escape.

I think they had information from those guys...

"Hey, Sicily."

"Yes, what is it?"

"The demons, they couldn't finish off August and the others, right?"

"Huh? Oh, yes. His Highness and the others were perplexed by the demons' cooperation, and the demons couldn't break through the bestowed magic on their combat attire."

Because it was that kind of battle, August instructed everyone to explore new ways of fighting, shifting from brute force to cooperation, preparing new magical tools, and providing support.

But still...

"Why haven't the demons come up with a countermeasure?"

"When you put it that way..."

If the demons had overwhelmed August and the others last time, that would make sense. But if the battle was at a standstill, shouldn't they have devised some kind of countermeasure?

"It's strange, isn't it?"

"Yes... What could it mean?"

"Participating in battle without any strategy, it's as if..."

"Oh no!"

"Miranda?!"

In the middle of their discussion, Miranda's scream echoed.

"It's urgent! I'm going there!"

"Oh, yes."

Despite being in the middle of a conversation, Sicily immediately used the Gate to rush to the scene where Miranda was in trouble.

"Maria, provide backup!"

"Understood!"

"Jeez! Did Miranda let her guard down too?"

"I'm doing my best with this! Ouch..."

"Stay still!"

Miranda isn't a magician, so she's probably not used to activating magical tools for defense in the spur of the moment. Still, she seems to be fine and relatively unharmed.

"Okay, it's done."

"Thanks, Sicily! Take this!"

After finishing her treatment, just like Alice before her, Miranda immediately headed towards the demon. In coordination with Maria, they defeated another demon effortlessly.

Once again, they were defeated quite easily. Well, it's true that these demons are stronger compared to the commoner demons they faced before. However, they haven't prepared any countermeasures against the previous battle, and it's evident from the way Maria and Miranda, who changed their tactics, defeated them so easily. According to that demon from the previous encounter, Zest or something like that, these guys were supposed to be former soldiers. Would such people come forward without a plan? This is just...

"...It's as if they're wishing for their own destruction..."

That's how it looked in my eyes.
