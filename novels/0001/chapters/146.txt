"Wasn't there a foreign military force stationed here, I believe?"
Tony's words were met with a nod from Aug.

"Yeah, it was a military force sent from the country that became the Empire. They apparently treated the people of the defeated nation as slaves."

Sicily exclaimed in astonishment at Aug's words.

"W-Was it really that bad!?"

"I didn't learn about that in class."

As Mark mentioned, their history classes at the Advanced Academy of Magic didn't provide detailed information, especially about other countries. At most, they learned that the Empire had expanded its territory by invading neighboring nations.

Thor and Julius were the only ones who didn't seem surprised by this revelation.

"Did you two know about this?"

"Yes. His Highness will become a king someday and will need to interact with the surrounding countries."

"Knowing the history of other countries is naturally necessary."

Recently, Thor and Julius had been serving as Aug's attendants and bodyguards. Their relationship would continue even after Aug was crowned king. Therefore, it was essential for them to have knowledge of the neighboring countries to assist Aug.

"And the commander of that foreign military force became a prominent noble and ruled the country, while his subordinates became local nobles, all while treating the people of the conquered country as slaves."

"So, does that mean the nobles treated the commoners as slaves?"

"That's right. Likely, after generations of such treatment, the idea that commoners were the property of the nobles and could be treated as they pleased became widespread. Well, it's just speculation, as I mentioned earlier."

I see... Those people who lost in the war probably accepted their slave status willingly.

After all, they had lost the war.

But as generations passed and a new generation grew up without experiencing the war, things were different.

They couldn't accept such unfair treatment from the nobles, even if their social status differed.

That built-up frustration probably led to an explosion...

"Hey. I understand that commoners resented the nobles and sought revenge by becoming demon hunters. But has there never been such a rebellion before? Zest's grudge... must have been substantial, right?"

"Lawrence was like that too. Well, the answer is that they couldn't even if they wanted to."

"They couldn't?"

"Yeah, because the Empire never provided thorough education for the commoners."

"Education?"

"That's right. Without proper education, they couldn't figure out what to do even if they felt it was unjust. Without the knowledge, they couldn't organize a rebellion."

I see...

"There have been rebellions in the past. However, the education they were denied included combat techniques. A trained military versus an amateur group. Do you think they stood a chance?"

"...So they've been suppressing it this way..."

"That's right. By forcefully suppressing them like that, the commoners lost their will to resist and became mere exploited subjects of the nobles. That's our view of the situation."

Aug had been speculating all along, but his statements seemed to hold a sense of conviction.

He probably had looked into the Empire's situation. And maybe Lawrence's words this time gave him more confidence in his conclusions.

Nevertheless, it's a stomach-churning story.

In this world, there are no laws governing warfare.

A country that wins a war can treat the defeated nation as it pleases.

However, normally, they don't treat the defeated nation's citizens as slaves.

Even without explicit laws, such actions go against humanity.

But the old Empire... They committed such inhumane acts.

They treated the defeated nation itself as slaves.

It's only natural they would be resented.

And that's when I had a question.

"Hey, I remember when we went to war with Aarlshyde before, you mentioned that the Empire had demon hunters too. Were nobles involved in that as well?"

"No way. Such dirty work is definitely reserved for commoners."

"Then, could commoners learn combat techniques..."

"The Empire's Hunter Association is unique. It's completely state-run."

"So..."

"Hunters were under the complete control of the state. If a hunter even thought about planning a rebellion using their combat skills... it would mean the annihilation of their entire family."

"They went to such lengths..."

"Nevertheless, it seems that many chose to become hunters because they could lead a better life compared to other commoners."

This country is truly revolting! The Bluesphere Empire!

"To be honest, I think this country's downfall was self-inflicted... We've arrived. The symbol of that vanity, the Imperial Castle."

They finally reached the large castle that had been visible in the distance for a while. After listening to Aug's words, it now appeared to them as the castle of fools that fell due to their vanity.

The gate of the castle stood wide open as if inviting them in.

Inside the gate, it was pitch black, almost like a portal to another world.

"Come on, let's go."

Aug spoke up as they were about to pass through the gate. They probably needed to gather their resolve to step in.

It felt that eerie.

As they passed through the gate, they found the castle completely dark, so they each used their light magic to navigate through the interior.

"It's so dark..."

"Hey, Maria, don't cling to me. It's hard to walk."

"But... I can't use magic, you know. If Maria doesn't stick with me, I won't be able to walk."

"I understand, but..."

Maria, who was not comfortable with this kind of atmosphere due to the recent events in the magical city, was walking while clinging to Miranda. She really seems to be scared.

Looking at Maria, who was excessively afraid, I wondered how the others were feeling. While not as much as Maria, they all had anxious expressions.

"Our detection magic isn't picking up anything, so we should be fine."

"That's right, Messina, you're being too scared."

"I'm different from Shin and His Highness. I can't use magic on multiple things simultaneously. If I use light magic, I can't use detection magic!"

Come to think of it, that's right.

Everyone was using light magic for illumination, so they couldn't use detection magic. That's probably the reason for their anxious expressions.

"Don't worry. So far, there haven't been any responses other than Strom."

Just as he said that,

"Shin..."

"Yeah... What's going on? Aren't there any demons left besides Strom?"

"W-Wait, Shin! What's happening?"

Aug seemed to have noticed as well.

At that moment, Maria, who couldn't use detection magic, uttered an anxious voice.

I thought the others would feel the same, so I explained.

"Right now... there was a magical reaction from a demon other than Strom."

"No way!?"

Maria exclaimed, and Aug replied.

"It's true. But... is it just one?"

"No, it's small, but there are other magical reactions too. What is it? Why is the reaction so faint? Do they have a pet, like a dog or a cat?"

"I don't know, but judging from the size of the magical power, it's probably not Strom... What should we do?"

"That's true..."

Aug asked me, and after some thought, I said:

"Let's head to the location of the demon we just found first. It would be troublesome if we were interrupted in the middle of a battle with Strom."

"Agreed."

With Aug's consent, we headed towards the source of the magical reaction other than Strom.

However... it was different from what the demon told us at the entrance to the magical city.

The demon leaders should undoubtedly be related to Zest.

After all, he used to be their captain.

But in reality, there was another demon left.

Did that demon lie?

However, that demon's reaction was not showing any signs of movement, even though it must have known we were getting closer. What's going on? Is that demon highly skilled?

"Aug..."

"Yeah. There's a possibility that we might enter combat as soon as we encounter them. Stay on your guard."

"Yes!"

Aug seemed to feel the same way as I did.

We all refocused our determination and continued walking towards the demon.

And then...

"This is the room."

"Yeah, no doubt."

The magical reaction of the demon was emanating from one of the rooms inside the castle.

Even as we approached the door, there was no sign of movement at all.

"I'm going to open it..."

"Yeah."

After looking at everyone, I forcefully opened the door.

We immediately assumed combat stances.

However, the demon inside did not launch an attack at us when we burst in. Instead, she seemed to be shielding something with her arms.

Sensing that it wouldn't immediately turn into a battle, we relaxed our combat stances.

And as we looked at the demon...

"A female... demon?"

In the room, there was a female demon.

She appeared to be in her mid-twenties, a young woman with long hair.

The female demon, upon seeing us, didn't attack but continued to glare at us, shielding something in her arms.

Although her eyes clearly showed hostility, there was no sign of her launching an attack.

Curious about what she was protecting so dearly, I took a closer look at what was in the arms of the female demon.

"Y-You! Isn't that a baby?!"

The woman demon was holding what appeared to be a newborn baby.

"You! Did you kidnap this baby!?"

Aug, after confirming the baby like me, raised his voice.

"No!!"

The female demon, perhaps thinking that her baby would be taken away, yelled and clutched the baby even tighter.

"No? What do you mean?"

I said that, but despite my words, I had a certain premonition upon hearing the demon's scream.

The baby wasn't kidnapped.

Could it be...?

Unbelievably, I was left in disbelief, and the female demon continued to speak.

"This child... this child is mine and..."

With the female demon...

"...Strom-sama's child."

"!!!!"

Upon hearing the words of the female demon, everyone seemed to have their breaths taken away.

"Nonsense... can demons... can monsters bear children? Is that even possible?"

Aug, who is usually composed in such situations, seemed to be unable to believe this situation, and his words lacked vigor.

I felt the same way.

I never thought that demons could have children.

It was at that moment when the baby being cradled by the female demon opened its eyes and looked towards us.

"I see... I get it now."

I understood everything.

The desperate situation that occurred with the demon.

What Zest had said about demons having no future.

I understood the meaning of it.

Because that baby...

"His eyes..."

Were not the typical red eyes of demons but instead had the same eyes as a regular human.
