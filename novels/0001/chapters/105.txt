"Disaster-class demons have appeared!?"

Through the open channel, Mark had just dropped a bombshell.

"That's ridiculous! We wiped out all the disaster-class demons earlier!" Even through the open channel, you could hear Oug's bewildered voice, which was understandable. By the time I arrived, there were no disaster-class demons left; there should have been only demons.

"What does this mean!? Weren't there just those demons coming from the old capital!?"

"I don't know! Just come back quickly!"

"Okay, got it!"

Mark was surprisingly agitated.

It must be an extremely urgent situation.

"Cecily! Let's hurry back!"

"Yes!"

"Wait a minute, Shin! Take me with you!"

"Garlan?"

What should I do?

To be honest, I didn't think Garlan would be able to stand up to disaster-class demons.

Taking him with us and exposing him to danger...

"Please, I just came back from the front lines a few days ago. If those who took my place on the front lines are in danger, I can't just sit still."

Given that, I couldn't strongly object, and there was no time to waste hesitating.

"In that case... but please don't think of fighting the disaster-class demons."

"Yeah, I know my place."

With the promise from Garlan not to engage the disaster-class demons, I opened a gate to the site of Arlsheid's camp.

"Wow, this is amazing... It took over a week to get back here with shift changes, but now it's in an instant... wow."

As Garlan, who followed us through the gate, marveled at our arrival, his voice gradually tapered off.

It's only natural.

I, too, was left speechless by the sight that met me as soon as I passed through the gate.

Looking around, several gates had opened, and everyone, including Oug, was gathering here one by one. But everyone who had just passed through the gate had their eyes wide open, struck dumb.

"W-What the... is this..."

It wasn't until Garlan finally found his voice that anyone was able to speak.

The sight was that astonishing.

"Bean! Bean, are you there!?"

"Yes, Your Highness! I'm here!"

"What is going on here!?"

After some time, Oug, who had finally regained consciousness, called for Mark and demanded an explanation of the situation.

"This happened after the reports from everyone were finished. Disaster-class demons have appeared from the old capital."

"I understand that. But... what is this? What are all these numbers?"

The scene that left us all speechless was the horde of disaster-class demons that filled the horizon, slowly approaching us.

"I received a report from a soldier who was monitoring the old capital, saying that more demons were coming from there. So, I used my farsight magic to see what was happening..."

Mark paused there, scanned everyone, and continued.

"Indeed, it seems like disaster-class-sized demons emerged from the old capital. One after another... they kept appearing without end, and eventually led to this situation."

The scene at that moment must have been extremely shocking. Mark spoke in a tone as if he had witnessed something unbelievable.

"What in the world... could it be that disaster-class demons were hiding in every part of the old capital?"

"Every part of the old capital... How many could there possibly be?"

Oug honestly voiced the least desired possibility. The old Blue Sphere Empire, once known as a major nation, had a capital city comparable in size to the royal capital of the Earlsheid Kingdom. If disaster-class demons were lurking in all of it...

It's not surprising that Maria blurted out how many there could possibly be.

"Several hundred... no, maybe even thousands?"

I unintentionally murmured. Disaster-class demons are classified as such due to their large size, and generally, they have massive bodies. Considering that, there could easily be thousands.

"Thousands of disaster-class demons... Haha... please spare us from such jokes..."

Hearing my muttering, Garlan, who happened to be nearby, laughed dryly and then gazed at the approaching horde of demons with a look of despair.

For Garlan and the others, who couldn't handle disaster-class demons alone, this was indeed a nightmarish sight.

As a group capable of fighting disaster-class demons individually, we still found this sight to be something we hoped was just a bad joke.

"What are we going to do, Oug...?"

"...Even if you ask what we should do... Do you believe we can subdue this number by ourselves?"

"..."

To be honest, it's not impossible.

However...

"...If we're allowed to change the terrain..."

"Alright, let's find a way to detain them."

He dismissed it right away, huh? Heh.

"I had a feeling it might come to this, but it's truly possible..."

"Even I don't want to do it. If we do that, I might become an enemy of the world."

"At least you've finally learned some restraint."

Oug's tone might have some issues, but I can imagine it, more or less.

But once it's like this, it immediately becomes complicated.

"But what about you, Oug? This number is really tough for just the two of us."

"Hmm..."

"We might have some time now, but we can't be this leisurely for long."

"I understand. I'm thinking about it right now, so just wai..."

"W-What's going on here!?"

A loud voice suddenly interrupted Oug. When I turned to look, there was a large group of troops, and a man who seemed to be their commander had just shouted.

"They arrived at this time..."

"Huh? Who are these troops?"

"When the disaster-class demons appeared earlier, reports said that relief forces were sent from various countries..."

"I see, I didn't have a radio..."

"We had no way to contact the departing forces. It seems they've arrived at this timing."

"Your Highness August! What is happening? We heard reports that there were only a few dozen of them."

I couldn't tell which country's commander he was, but from his equipment, he seemed like a high-ranking officer who spoke to Oug.

"We don't know either. We reported that we had already defeated all the reported demons..."

"That is incredible enough, but... even so..."

The commander was at a loss for words as he looked at the horde of demons slowly spreading across the horizon, approaching us.

"Can humans do anything against this...?"

Another commander from a different country seemed to have joined the conversation.

The commanders from various countries stared at the horde of disaster-class demons, which were still only visible in the distance, with a sense of despair.

The military forces standing behind them wore the same expressions.

Nevertheless, they were moving quite slowly. When observing from a distance, it almost felt like we'd stumbled into a zoo or safari park...

"That's right! Cages!"

"Cages?"

"Yes! The progression of those demons is extremely slow. Now, can't we create cages to isolate them?"

"I see! Ultimate Magicians, please gather!"

What I remembered was the zoo from my previous life. There, dangerous animals were kept from getting out using cages or fences.

At this stage when they were still far away, I thought that it might be possible to create a massive magical wall to isolate them.

"Listen, everyone. We'll create a wall to isolate those demons! Shin, how big should the wall be, in your opinion?"

"I think around thirty meters in height with a thickness of about five meters should be good."

"A wall that's five meters thick and thirty meters high!?"

Garan intervened with his thoughts on the matter in response to Oug's consultation. Disaster-class demons were only about ten meters tall at most, so I figured thirty meters should be more than enough for the height, and a five-meter thickness should suffice.

"Thin and small, huh? In that case, how about a wall that's fifty meters high and ten meters thick?"

"No, no! I said the opposite! It's too thick and too big!"

"Oh, I see. Well, a thin and small wall is better than one that can be easily broken through, isn't it?"

"Y-Yeah, you're right, but..."

"Your Highness, how far should we extend the wall?"

Garan seemed to be holding his head for some reason, but the discussion about building the wall continued.

Alice asked how far the wall should be extended.

"If possible, I'd like to cover everything, including the old imperial capital, but..."

"Isn't that impossible?"

"Can't it be done?"

"Huh?"

Oug seems to want to surround the old imperial capital with a wall, but Tohr apparently thinks it's impossible. So, I, who seemed capable of accomplishing that, chimed in.

"I'll create a wall flying from the other side of the old imperial capital to here. That way, demons won't be able to get out, though the same may not apply to the demons."

"Can you really do that, even you?"

Oug started to voice his doubts but then apparently thought better of it.

Having a close friend who knows you well is a blessing.

"I can easily imagine what you're thinking. I only know how exceptional your power is."

"Then, even if it's a lie, say that you trust me!"

"Sorry, I can't lie."

"Absolutely, that's a lie!"

Oug sighed and shrugged his shoulders, and the others around him gave wry smiles.

Darn it, it wasn't a word of trust after all.

"Well, in a way, I trust your abnormality. So, I'm counting on you."

"Every edge of your words seems to carry malice, but well, it's okay. Then I'll go and create a wall from the other side of the old imperial capital, so the rest of you can handle creating the front wall."

"Okay, we'll leave it to you!"

Representing everyone, Alice replied with a thumbs-up.

"Shin-kun."

In response to Alice's cheerful response, Sishirie stepped forward from her side and spoke to me.

"Are you going alone?"

"Yeah. I want as many people as possible here to create this wall, so I need you guys to help. But..."

"I see... it's important for you to watch out for them in the old imperial capital."

"It'll be fine. I won't be flying directly above the old imperial capital. I'll go around it. So..."

"Ah..."

Amidst the lack of concern from anyone else, Sishirie was the only one genuinely worried about me.

I couldn't help but feel happy about it and hugged Sishirie tightly.

"You guys, make a sturdy wall too."

"Shin-kun... Yes, we'll do our best!"

While we were speaking like that, Maria suddenly commented, and I realized that the soldiers who had had despairing expressions until a while ago were now looking at us with warm eyes.

"Well, whatever. It's too late now."

"How embarrassing..."

How many times is it already? I'm getting used to it.

In the first part of the text:

"We even had a formal engagement announcement party. It's fine to show affection in public!"

"Think about the time and place! You idiot!"

"Oh well. I'm off then."

"Ah!"

As Oug was about to explode, I gave Sishirie a quick kiss on the forehead and used levitation magic to rise up. I decided to head to the scene before they could give me a lecture. Looking down, I could see Oug, who was shaking his head in exasperation, and a beet-red Sishirie, looking as if she was about to boil like an octopus.

"Alright, I'm going."

After addressing everyone on the ground, I took off with flying magic towards the starting point for creating the wall.

In the second part:

"Really, does he have no sense of tension at all?"

"Well, he's Lord Shin..."

Enormous disaster-level monsters filled the horizon and were slowly advancing toward them. Even though it was a sight that could be called the end of the world, Oug sighed in exasperation while watching Shin fly off as usual, and Thor smiled wryly.

For the commanders of different nations, not only was the sight of the monsters on the enemy side hard to believe, but they also couldn't comprehend the actions of Shin and his friends, who were supposed to be their allies.

"And Your Highness... what are you being so playful for in such a critical situation?"

"Yes, that's right! And the Demon Lord said a wall like that could be created right away!?"

The criticisms from the commanders of different nations were entirely justified. In the face of the abnormal emergence and invasion of disaster-level monsters, it seemed like friends were joking around. That's the only way it appeared.

"Well, indeed. You're right. Then let's get started. How many meters can you all manage?"

"I can probably do about ten meters at once."

"I can manage around five meters, I guess. I'm not so good with earth magic."

"Me neither."

In response to Oug's question, Maria said she could do around ten meters, and Alice and Lynn said about five meters.

"I usually use earth magic quite a bit in my regular blacksmithing and sculpting work, so I think I can manage around fifteen meters."

In the midst of these answers, Mark, who often worked with earth magic in his blacksmithing and sculpting, mentioned the highest number.

The words puzzled the various commanders.

"Five meters, ten meters... What on earth are you talking about?"

"Well, you'll understand once you see it. Now, take your positions, evenly spaced apart."

"Yes!"

After providing instructions to everyone, Augustus, who had dodged the commander's question, added a final comment.

"Don't care what's on the other side of the wall! In fact, if you dig too deep, it could become an obstacle! Go all out!"

"Understood!"

In response to Augustus's command, the Ultimate Magicians replied in unison. This resulted in an enormous amount of magical energy gathering around them, more than the magic corps of each nation had ever felt.

"W-What is this!?"

"What an enormous amount of magical energy..."

"So these are the Ultimate Magicians..."

Astonished and dumbfounded, the wizards couldn't comprehend what was happening.

Ignoring them, the Ultimate Magicians recalled the measurements Shin had mentioned earlier: a height of thirty meters, a thickness of five meters, and a width as wide as possible.

Once they had a clear image in mind, they simultaneously placed their hands on the ground and activated their magic.

Instantly...

"Whoa!?"

"Is this an earthquake!?"

"What is that!?"

The ground suddenly began to shake. Immediately afterward, walls made of earth magic sprang up, as if growing from the ground. These were the walls with the size that had been mentioned earlier - too thick and too large, as some had argued.

The walls were constructed in an instant, and there was a noticeable difference in width among them.

"I see... The earlier declarations were about how much width of a wall one could create at once..."

"That's right. We can still check now, so look on the other side of the wall."

Augustus addressed the commanders who had come to accept various things. Intrigued by his words, the commanders ran toward the other side of the wall.

"Be careful. The other side is a cliff."

Augustus pointed out the area that had been a flat plain just moments ago but had turned into a cliff. The commanders, now uncertain, slowed down their running pace.

As a result...

"Wh-whoa!"

"Th-this is..."

"Incredible..."

The soil used to create these towering walls was sourced from the ground on the other side of the walls. As a result, a very deep trench had been created in front of the walls.

"So, didn't I tell you to be careful?"

With that comment, those who hadn't questioned it were almost in danger of falling off the cliff.

This fact made the various commanders, who had been questioning the attitude of Augustus and the others moments ago, finally understand.

"If they can perform magic on this level... I can accept their confidence earlier."

"Really... It feels like I'm in a dream."

Soldiers who had been watching from behind the commanders began to murmur, astonished by the results. Despite the praise, Augustus and his group remained extremely composed.

"Well, it's nice to be praised, but..."

"Huh?"

Augustus chuckled as he spoke, baffling the commanders.

"Well, to be honest, when I think about what might have happened if Lord Shin had been in charge, I can't be that... straightforward about it."

What if we compare it to Shin? The members of the Ultimate Magicians couldn't take much pride in their magic when they thought about that.

Just as Thor was about to express such thoughts, a plume of dust rose in the far distance. The dust was then swiftly propelled sideways and moved to encircle the old imperial capital and the horde of monsters.

"Don't tell me..."

Augustus, who had a bad feeling, used a farseeing spell to investigate the source of the dust.

"As I suspected..."

While creating enormous walls with earth magic, Shin was seen flying just above the ground with flight magic. While they struggled to make walls of five or ten meters, what was Shin doing? How many tens of meters of wall was he creating at once? And how often?

Augustus and his group couldn't help but be astonished, and the commanders were left in shock, their jaws dropping open.

"We'll keep making walls too! You guys, look where you're standing; you'll be trapped inside the walls if you stay there! Get to safety quickly!"

The various commanders, as well as Galan, who had been in awe, pictured themselves being left on the inside of the wall amid the horde of catastrophic-level monsters. They panicked and hurried to evacuate.

"Let's not let Shin shoulder all the burden! We'll make as many walls as we can!"

With Augustus's words, everyone began creating walls once again.

Shin, who had been making huge walls at high speed, suddenly stopped and crossed the gap between the horde of monsters and Augustus's group. Once he reached a certain point, he began constructing walls in the direction of the old imperial capital.

("I guess I'll leave the rest to them.")

Shin didn't plan to do everything alone; he wanted Augustus and the others to contribute. This way, the results would belong to everyone. Augustus understood that this was probably Shin's reasoning.

"He's really... a strange person. As unusual as ever."

"He's quite a mysterious guy."

"That's for sure."

Thanks to Shin, things seemed like they would work out. Augustus couldn't help but smile.

"All right, just a bit more. Let's do this properly!"

"Yes!"

In this way, the walls Shin had started and the walls created by Augustus and his group connected, completing the wall that fully enclosed the old imperial capital.

In this manner, they were able to create a massive wall that fully encircled the old imperial capital. With this, they could buy some time, during which they could formulate a strategy. Of course, their ultimate goal was the eradication of the monsters, but they also needed to discuss the methods, especially now that Strom's side had sent their demon lords. To be honest, having this as their only means of delaying the enemy made them anxious.

With such thoughts in mind, I returned to Augustus and the others. I released the flight magic and landed on the ground, where I was greeted by the loud cheers of soldiers from various nations.

"That was amazing, Demon Lord!"

"No, at this point, we should probably address you as 'Demon Lord,' shouldn't we?"

What the...?! I'm already quite a big deal being a Demon Lord; do I need more titles?!

"Demon Lord! How's that? It fits oddly well!"

"Demon Lord! Demon Lord!"

I was left in a state of bewilderment by the sudden chorus of "Demon Lord."

...When did we become the Demon Lord's army?

In my bewilderment, Sicily and, following her, Augustus came over to me.

"Shin! That was incredible!"

"No kidding... What in the world was that? To be honest, it looked more like a paranormal phenomenon."

"A paranormal phenomenon... We had to encircle them before the horde of monsters arrived. We had to hurry, so it ended up like that."

"Really, you still can't hold back, huh?"

"Huh? Was it bad?"

I didn't use any flashy attack magic, and the soldiers seemed fine with it.

"That's just because they can't wrap their heads around such a supernatural event. It's a form of escapism."

"Escapism...?"

As I exchanged words with Augustus, commanders also gathered.

"Well, you truly live up to the title of the Magic King and being called the Demon Lord."

"Indeed. I thought His Highness Augustus's magic was amazing, but this is on a different level."

"The difference is staggering, isn't it?"

Following the commander's somewhat hesitant words, Augustus took over.

"What's with the shock? We're the ones who understand better than anyone else the tremendous gap in abilities between Shin and us."

Once again, the commanders wore astonished expressions in response to Augustus' frank statement.

Well, that's true. Augustus, who's a member of the royal family, tends to forget, but there's a massive power gap between him and other people.

It would be impossible for a royal family member to openly claim that a person of common birth surpasses them in ability.

"Don't be bothered about such a significant gap in power. Don't worry about it."

"That's right. Anyway, Augustus, about what we should do from here..."

Just as I was about to ask Augustus about their plans for the future...

"Hahaha! Ahahaha! Ahahahaha!"

It sounded like amplified magic.

A joyful laughter suddenly resonated, audible to all of us in front of the hastily constructed wall.

"Well, well, as usual, you've done something outrageous."

The voice had a familiar ring to it.

"Augustus, what's going on here?"

"I know!"

"Hehe, long time no see. Your Highness Augustus, Shin Wolford."

"You... Strom!"

Strom!

Yes, the ringleader of the demons, it was the voice of Oliver Strom.
