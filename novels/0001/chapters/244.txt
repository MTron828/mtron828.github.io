"Oh, of course, Ellie, but isn't Sicily unable to use magic now? It's just in case something unexpected happens. I put it on just to be safe."

"Oh, really? What kind of enchantment is it?"

"It's an enchantment that, when it detects potential harm to the wearer, automatically deploys barriers for both magical and physical protection."

At first, I thought about making it react to malicious intent, but I couldn't come up with a clear image for that. So, I created a magical radar-like field with a two-meter radius around the pendant. If something approaches the body at a speed that might cause harm, the barrier deploys. It turned out to be a happy accident, as it also prevents accidents without malicious intent.

Explaining this, Aug and Ellie smiled with gratitude.

"This is really helpful, Shin. You did a great job."

"Thank you, Shin. Aug, can you put it on right away?"

"Yes."

Aug said so and put the pendant on Ellie. With the pendant on, Ellie happily touched the pendant's top.

"Shin, thank you. I'll have to thank you properly next time."

"It's fine. I made it for my friends, so there's no need for thanks."

Even though I had made magical tools for them for free before, why did I suddenly say that now?

"Ellie is just a regular human, you know. Unlike Lady Wolford or Lady Bean, she doesn't have much crisis management ability. A magical tool that automatically protects her is truly appreciated."

"Hey, don't compare me to the Ultimate Magicians' ladies."

Aug was explaining seriously, but Ellie seemed displeased with being compared to Sicily and Olivia.

"I really wanted to pay you back for this, but..."

"It's okay. If it bothers you, let's call it a gift for my future child."

"I see... Alright, I'll accept your kindness."

"Yeah. Oh, by the way, don't trip, okay? The barrier won't activate if you fall."

"Understood. Thank you, Shin. Farewell, everyone."

With those words, Ellie passed through the gate and returned to the royal castle.

"By the way, Aug actually complimented my magical tool for once."

"That's true. Shin, you can create magical tools to protect Sicily, but His Highness can't do that."

"Is that so? I thought you would usually say something like, 'You're making something like this again,' and give me a hard time."

When I said that, Sicily looked a bit exasperated.

"So, did you make it knowing that you'd get comments like that?"

"Well, yeah. No matter how much Aug complains, I can't compromise on Sicily's safety. I made it, fully aware that I could get scolded, but I didn't mind."

"I see..."

When I firmly stated that, Sicily blushed and looked down.

Seeing this, Ekaterina chuckled.

"Hehe, you two really get along well. In the end, His Highness shares the same sentiment as Shin. No matter how extraordinary or unconventional it may be, he thought that nothing should compromise the safety of his queen."

"Well, Aug does care a lot about Ellie."

"Hmm... not just care, he's quite doting, you know?"

"He is? Really?"

Aug doting on Ellie... or rather, in my eyes, it seemed like Aug was completely at Ellie's mercy. He was unusually tongue-tied when Ellie cornered him, and he forgot to contact her during his business trip to Quanrong.

He's... basically a domineering person, but does he have masochistic tendencies too?

"It seems like you're thinking something strange again, but His Highness's deep affection for Ellie is quite well-known."

"I see."

Come to think of it, didn't Aug become interested in Ellie when she didn't show any interest in me at the debutante ball? I found it surprising at the time. After all, Ellie used to be jealous of me for being too close to Aug, so I thought she would be the one pursuing him.

In the end, Aug and Ellie are truly in love.

"Well, it means that Ellie values Aug's comments enough to forget about them. It's good that they have such a strong bond."

"Hehe, that's true."

"But still, isn't this a bit too much joy? As the Crown Princess, Ellie should be heavily protected by those around her, and there shouldn't be any danger, right?"

"That's true, but pregnant women really need to be cautious. I've been constantly scolded by Natasha whenever I tried to do something..."

Sicily said this while looking at Natasha, a dispatched envoy from the Ishtalika Kingdom who had been silently observing the situation.

She probably thinks she's giving me a stern look, but the way she pouts while gazing at me, soon to become the mother of two children, is incredibly cute and stirs up my protective instincts.

But poor Natasha, who was being stared at, looked flustered.

"H-However! It's unthinkable to burden the Holy Lady with anything while she's with child! No matter what anyone says, I won't yield!"

Natasha replied in a fluster.

Why is she so fanatically devoted to the Holy Lady?

Originally, Miranda was Sicily's friend and also served as a guard, so she had apparently become quite close to Natasha.

In response to Miranda's comments, Natasha fiercely retorted, "What are you saying, Miranda!? She's the Holy Lady! The entire world's people must unite to protect her!"

The entire world... Well, to begin with, the title of "Holy Lady" that Sicily is referred to as isn't an official position in the Church of Creation God. It's more like a nickname that people have given her.

"Well, it's true that Sicily, who can't use magic right now, is just a delicate woman..."

"That's right!"

"But that doesn't mean you should be overly protective!"

"That's not the case at all!"

Oh boy, Miranda and Natasha are starting to argue.

Even Ekaterina, who had given the order to protect Sicily at all costs, is smiling wryly.

Even someone like Ekaterina has her own thoughts about Natasha's overprotectiveness, I wonder?

Thinking that, Granny chimed in, exasperated.

"My, oh my. It's nice that you care so much for Sicily, but it's not good to not let her do anything."

"Huh?"

Natasha looked disbelievingly at Granny, who is the Pope of the Church of Creation God and the head of state of the Ishtalika Kingdom.

"I can't believe even the Archbishop would say such a thing..."

"This isn't about Sicily, but about not letting a pregnant woman move at all. That's not good."

I've heard that before.

In the past, it seems like there were notions that pregnant women needed to consume extra nutrients for their baby and that it was fine to gain weight for that purpose. However, I've heard that when pregnant women gain too much weight, it narrows the birth canal and can be detrimental.

"Is that so?"

"What's up with you? Aren't you a healing magician?"

Natasha, who rose to the rank of bishop in the Church of Creation God at a young age, naturally should be able to use healing magic, but her knowledge seems somewhat skewed.

As I was thinking that, Ekaterina provided the answer.

"Natasha can use healing magic, but her specialty is actually offensive magic. So, when it comes to Sicily's protection or as a deterrent, she was chosen."

Oh, I see. Well, if we're looking for healing magic, we can rely on Sicily, and if we need support, someone with combat abilities is more suitable than a healing magician.

"She didn't become a bishop as a healing magician but was recognized for her achievements in defending the country with her offensive magic. It's a bit harsh to expect Natasha to have knowledge about healing."

Now that I think about it, the image of a Church of Creation God priestess is often associated with healing magic, but even in the Ishtalika Kingdom, there is a military force to protect against the threat of monsters. It's not just composed of knights, so it wouldn't be surprising to have individuals who can use offensive magic.

Imagery is quite powerful, isn't it?

"Well, as long as she doesn't do anything dangerous like lifting heavy things, some light exercise is recommended. So, you take her for a walk every day, right?"

Granny said that, and Natasha nodded in agreement, saying, "I see."

"I've been wondering why you take us guards out for a walk every day... So, that's the reason."

Well, Sicily goes out for a walk every day, so I made that magical tool for her safety.

By the way, Silver's walks are mainly taken care of by Grandpa and Granny. I felt sorry for bothering them, but they seem happy to play with Silver, so I decided not to worry about it. Sometimes, Sicily's mother, Irene, also comes to take care of Silver.

"Well, if Aug and Ellie can find peace of mind with what I've made, that's great."

When I said that, everyone looked at me with warm eyes.

"W-What's going on?"

When I said that, Ekaterina had a warm, or rather, a smirking expression.

"Shin, you really do care about your friends, huh."

"Wha-!?"

W-What!?

"You do whatever it takes for the sake of your friends. Maybe that book's content isn't entirely wrong, after all?"

"Wha-what?... I mean, it's only natural to help your friends."

I suddenly started to feel embarrassed.

As I said that, Granny had an unusually gentle look on her face.

"That's one of Shin's virtues. That's why everyone gathers around you."

W-What's going on?

Granny being gentle like this.

Is this the sign of an impending catastrophe?

Feeling uneasy about this unusual Granny, she let out a sigh for some reason.

"Well, your way of helping is quite nonsensical, though. That's your flaw."

"Hey!"

When Granny said that, the living room burst into laughter.

The only ones not laughing were me and Silver, who didn't understand the meaning.

Damn it... I thought it was weird for Granny to praise me!nd a dish
