Chapter 3223: Thirteen Elements at Perfection Level

After the old dragon left, Huang Xiaolong started to cultivate diligently. The first thing he did was to refine all the Flowers of Time.

Since he received the assistance of the old dragon’s grand cosmos energy, his comprehension ability grew by leaps and bounds. He could refine the herbs at a much faster rate, and it didn’t take long for him to reach the major completion stage in the power of time.

That was also where he got stuck. After entering the major completion stage, Huang Xiaolong realized that there was an invisible barrier stopping him from entering perfection level.

Knowing that there was nothing he could do but to slowly comprehend the power of time, Huang Xiaolong decided to play with the four Origin Divine Fires in his body.

No matter how hard he tried, the four fires refused to obey his every command. He couldn’t use their power no matter how hard he tried, and he gnashed his teeth in anger.

A hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye, and Huang Xiaolong failed to reach perfection level in the power of time. However, the barrier that was stopping him was no longer as strong as it once was!

If Huang Xiaolong were to compare the barrier he felt a hundred thousand years ago, it would be a ten meter thick wall. Now, the thickness was reduced to a mere two meters! He could feel the power of time slowly approaching the perfection level.

The old dragon visited Huang Xiaolong on the one hundred thousand year mark.

When he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s speed of cultivation, he couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

“With your current speed, you will definitely take less than two hundred thousand years to reach the perfection level in the power of time. From there, reaching the grand perfection level is a matter of time.”

“Two hundred thousand years?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

The old dragon couldn’t help but smack Huang Xiaolong on the head when he heard the dissatisfaction, “Are you trying to be annoying? Even Huang Sheng took several tens of millions of years to reach perfection level in all thirteen elements! Even if two hundred thousand years pass, you probably wouldn’t have cultivated for a million years!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but reveal a sheepish smile.

“The difficulty of comprehending the last element is astounding. When you break through the barrier, there will no longer be anything stopping you from growing stronger. Do you know how many people in the universe are stuck at the barrier between the twelfth and the thirteenth element?!”

“Think about that little lass Zeng Ying! There’s Huang Ji and the Evil Wind Patriarch who are currently still stuck with twelve elements at the perfection level!”

Everyone the old dragon talked about were experts whose fame could shake the universe.

“Master, has Zeng Ying already comprehended her twelfth element to the perfection level?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

With a deep gaze, the old dragon looked at Huang Xiaolong before chuckling slightly, “That’s right. The little lass only managed to comprehend the power of time to the major completion stage. She might be talented, but it won’t be easy for her to reach the perfection level. Everything will depend on her fate.”

“What? Are you interested in the little lass?” The old dragon continued, “Do you want me to help you ask for her hand in marriage? I can go talk to Zeng Ling right now. With your talent and my status, Zeng Ling will definitely agree! Moreover, you interacted with the little lass for quite a period of time. Weren’t there some rumors going about where she protected you from You Ming? She said you’re her friend, right? Hehehe, her impression of you isn’t too bad…”

Huang Xiaolong quickly shook his hand in denial when he realized how far off topic the old dragon was getting. “No no no! We’re just ordinary friends! Also, I already have several wives!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but think of Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others.

Since the World of Departed Souls would open nine hundred thousand years later, Huang Xiaolong planned to visit them before heading over.

The old dragon was stunned for a second, but he eventually left.

Returning to his cultivation, another hundred thousand years passed.

One fine day…

Thirteen rays of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body as it enveloped the space around him.

As the rays of light fused with each other, a beautiful scene was painted.

Huang Xiaolong’s power of time had finally reached perfection level! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When he broke through the final barrier, a figure appeared in the space above him. The old dragon stared at the energy surging through Huang Xiaolong’s body and he gasped in shock. He thought that Huang Xiaolong would be able to enter the final level after two hundred thousand years, but the brat proved him wrong!

He only took half the time to complete the power of time!

“Too talented… This little guy is too damn talented.” The old dragon sighed to himself.

As the oldest existence in the universe, the Blazing Dragon had seen the rise of countless geniuses in his mind. Almost everyone he noticed had amazing talent, but if he were to compare them to Huang Xiaolong, he would be comparing a firefly to a moon.

Of course, there was one part that confused the old dragon. Huang Xiaolong was Huang Long’s son, but it seemed as though his talent was even better than his father’s!

Could it be some sort of variation bloodline?

Otherwise, how could he be more talented than Huang Long?!

After speaking to Huang Xiaolong about the grand dao, the old dragon told him some points to take note of before leaving.

According to the old dragon’s plan. Huang Xiaolong should cultivate both the Soaring Dragon Art and the Blazing Dragon Grand Art at the same time.

Other people might be unable to cultivate two secret arts at the same time, but Huang Xiaolong was different. He had three small worlds, and it was possible for him to do so.

After some experimentation, the old dragon made Huang Xiaolong circulate the Soaring Dragon Art with one of the small worlds in his body. He would use the Blazing Dragon Grand Art with the second small world, and the last world was saved for the Pangu World Creation Art!”

With the power of three great arts, he would definitely be able to enter the God of Creation Realm in a hundred million years!

That was also the reason why the old dragon was so confident when he took Huang Xiaolong in as his disciple.

With the three small worlds in his body, Huang Xiaolong possessed a talent that neither him, nor Huang Long, or even Pangu had!

According to the old dragon’s teaching, Huang Xiaolong would use the two grand arts at the same time.

Even though he was talented, using the two of them at the same time posed a little challenge. After several years of trying, Huang Xiaolong finally began to get the hang of it. After several dozen years, Huang Xiaolong could use the two secret arts easily.

Huang Xiaolong discovered that when he used both secret arts at the same time, the speed at which he could devour universe origin energy increased by more than two times!

When an expert achieve perfection level in thirteen elements, they would be able to devour the universe origin energy in order to push themself to the grand perfection level.

When they finally reached the grand perfection level, the small worlds they created would absorb universe origin energy to produce grand cosmos energy!

That was also the source of Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao’s strength!

However, the two of them were unable to fully wield the power of grand cosmos energy. Otherwise, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to fight against the two of them even after his body was refined with the old dragon’s grand cosmos energy.
