Chapter 78: Heavenly Treasure List Number One

Huang Xiaolong slowly nodded his head; indeed, the Linglong Treasure Pagoda emitted fire dragon qi at all times inside his body and this qi was way purer than the fire qi that could be absorbed from the five-pointed star array in Dragon Flame Valley stone chambers.

The purity level could be said to be more than ten times greater. Like what Yu Ming had said earlier, this Linglong Treasure Pagoda would bring unimaginable benefits to Huang Xiaolong’s future cultivation.

“You said, as I grow stronger, this pagoda will play a bigger role?” Huang Xiaolong asked Yu Ming: “What do you mean?”

Yu Ming replied respectfully, “About the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, Subordinate doesn’t know much, but I heard some say that the Linglong Treasure Pagoda has nine layers in total. As its Master becomes stronger, each layer can be opened accordingly.”

“Nine layers in total!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked. Although he ‘reined in’ the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, but he truly did not know that there were nine layers inside the pagoda.

Could every floor hold a different treasure within?

At this time, Yu Ming’s voice sounded as he continued to explain, “Based on rumors, from the first layer of the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, it could produce something called the Fire Dragon Pearl; as for its uses, this Subordinate is not sure.”

Fire Dragon Pearl!

Huang Xiaolong’s heartbeat quickened. This Fire Dragon Pearl should be some kind of bead condensed out from the cumulation of fire dragon qi. In its natural form, fire dragon qi could temper and strengthen the physical body and enhance the quality of battle qi; therefore, needless to say, this Fire Dragon Pearl was probably even more potent. Swallowing it before practice could produce a better result a hundred times over!

Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong thought of an important issue and asked Yu Ming, “Then, this Fire Dragon Pearl, can others swallow it for cultivation?” If others could do so, when he opens the first layer later, he could give this Fire Dragon Pearl to his parents, little sister, little brother, Li Lu, as well as Fei Hou, Haotian, and the rest. Doesn’t this mean his parents and people close to him can also temper their physique and enhance their battle qi continuously?

Yu Ming was a little surprised with the question and after thinking for a moment, he said, “Others should be able to. However, Sovereign, according to rumors, the Linglong Treasure Pagoda needs natural spiritual aura to be able to form Fire Dragon Pearl, so it might be able to produce only one Fire Dragon Pearl after a certain period of time intermittently.”

This made Huang Xiaolong frown and he questioned, “Is there any other method to make the Linglong Treasure Pagoda produce more Fire Dragon Pearls?”

Yu Ming shook his head: “This, Subordinate doesn’t know.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly; it seems he could only wait and test it out in the future. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Then, do you know what level of strength is needed to open the first layer of the pagoda?” Huang Xiaolong asked in a somber voice.

“Rumours has it that one should be a Houtian Seventh Order, and the second layer needs to be a Xiantian First Order.” Yu Ming answered before adding, “But what strength is needed to open the third layer, this Subordinate doesn’t know.”

Houtian Seventh Order!

Huang Xiaolong was delighted! If this is true, then within half a year’s time, doesn’t that mean he could open the Linglong Treasure Pagoda’s first layer?

He was confident that he could break through to the Seventh Order in the upcoming six months.

“Do you know the number one treasure on the Heavenly Treasure List?” Huang Xiaolong asked another question out of curiosity; a treasure such as the Linglong Treasure Pagoda was only listed as the ninth, so this made Huang Xiaolong wonder about the treasure that was reputed as number one...

“I heard it was a mountain!” Yu Ming replied.

A mountain! Huang Xiaolong was stunned; he imagined many different possibilities, but it never crossed his mind that the first Heavenly Treasure would turn out to be a mountain!

Yu Ming nodded, “That’s right Sovereign, it is a mountain called Heavenly Mount. Xumi!”

“Heavenly Mount. Xumi!” Huang Xiaolong repeated.

“According to legens, on the Heavenly Mount. Xumi there is something called Geocentric Buddha Milk, a wonder accumulated between heaven and earth. After swallowing it, cultivation is only half the effort. The person who has the Heavenly Mount Xumi is said to be blessed with the great earth’s power, enhancing one’s defense until it reaches a certain threshold.” Yu Ming said, “Not only that, there is a battle skill within the Heavenly Mount Xumi called the Godly Xumi Law and it was claimed to be the strongest battle skill ever!”

Godly Xumi Law!

The strongest ever battle skill!

Then, that is the strongest battle skill in this world!

“However, after appearing once more hundreds of thousands years ago, there hasn’t been any news of the Heavenly Mount. Xumi since then.” Yu Ming shook his head as if in pity.

“Oh, why is that?” Huang Xiaolong was curious.

“Only those possessing superb talent martial spirits could rein in these Heavenly Treasures. The higher the rank of the Heavenly Treasure, the higher the requirements of martial spirits. Therefore, it needed people with grade thirteen and above martial spirits to have a chance. Especially in the case of the Heavenly Mount. Xumi, it needed someone with twin martial spirits of the same kind to rein it in, but in the Martial Spirit World, it has been thousands of years since someone like that has appeared!” At this point, Yu Ming’s eyes lit up like the stars as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “I didn’t expect that after so long, Sovereign actually possesses the same kind superb twin martial spirits!”

Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong was stunned at first and it turned to joy. If what Yu Ming said was true, then this Godly Mount Xumi is still ownerless; by chance, if he comes to encounter it in the future, he must definitely rein it!

“Sovereign, in fact, your Linglong Treasure Pagoda also has a set of heritage cultivation methods called the Golden Linglong Body!” Yu Ming stated matter-of-factly, “This Golden Linglong Body is a high-grade Heaven rank physique cultivation method.”

“Physique cultivation method!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were twinkling with delight; the Asura Tactics is but a battle qi cultivation technique, and at the moment, what he lacked most was a way to strengthen his physical body!

But, how can he get this cultivation method from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda?

“Sovereign, when you have advanced to the Seventh Order and are able to open the first layer of the pagoda, you may get it at that time.” Yu Ming smiled and said as if knowing what Huang Xiaolong was thinking about.

Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong was relieved.

So, that’s how it is!

All this time, Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou sat on the side, not daring to utter a sound, listening to Yu Ming and Huang Xiaolong’s conversation. The shock they received was hard to imagine even though both of them could be considered as strong experts, but just like Huang Xiaolong, this was their first time hearing about Heavenly Treasures that exist in this world!

Such amazing things!

“Do you have news about other Heavenly Treasures?” Again, Huang Xiaolong continued with his questions.

Huang Xiaolong asked the question casually, and Yu Ming’s answer surprised him, “Subordinate has heard that there is a Heavenly Treasure in the Duanren Empire’s Duanren Institute, the Absolute Soul Pearl! The Absolute Soul Pearl is ranked at number four on the list!”

Duanren Institute, Absolute Soul Pearl, Heavenly Treasure List number four!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone brightly.

Yu Ming added, “Years ago, for this Absolute Soul Pearl, the Old Sovereign had sneaked into the Duanren Institute. Unfortunately, before he could find it, he was found by the Duanren Institute’s guardians and was encircled by the institute’s experts. In the end, he could only leave with failure.”

Master Ren Wokuang also tried to get the Absolute Soul Pearl? This information was out of Huang Xiaolong’s expectation.

“Then, this Absolute Soul Pearl also has a heritage battle skill or physique cultivation method?”

Yu Ming nodded in affirmation, “Yes, in general, the first ten Heavenly Treasures will have them. The Absolute Soul Pearl contains a battle skill called the Absolute Soul Finger that is said to be able to penetrate to the deepest of hell once practiced to major completion!”

Can penetrate to the deepest of hell!

“As for news of other treasures, Subordinate is not clear.” Yu Ming said.

A while later, Yu Ming, Fei Hou, and Marshal Haotian receded from the main hall.

Meanwhile, Huang Xiaolong was lost in thought.

Unexpectedly, there was a ranked four Heavenly Treasure in Duanren Empire’s Duanren Institute, the Absolute Soul Pearl. Even with Master Ren Wokuang’s strength, he couldn’t take it out from the Duanren Institute. Then the only way to proceed was to become a Duanren Institute’s student, explore the grounds, and wait for the opportunity to strike.

Duanren Institute!

Battle of the Imperial City– as long as he could enter the first one thousand spots, he could be one of the Duanren Institute’s students.

With Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed, within a decade, he was sure to become the Cosmic Star Academy’s overall champion, and then he could proceed to the Duanren Empire to participate in the Imperial City Battle.
