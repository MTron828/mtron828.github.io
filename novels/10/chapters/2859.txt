Chapter 2860: Scram Now If You Know What’s Good For You!

Everyone was looking towards Huang Xiaolong’s direction in astonishment.

“What sound is this?! Did someone get an embryo from a stone opening?!”

“That must be it. Someone must have opened a holy-grade embryo!”

“Who has such amazing luck to get a holy embryo?!!”

People on the entire street boiled in excitement.

Although finding an embryo in the stone opening was not a big deal, finding a holy embryo was explosive news. After all, the last time a holy embryo had appeared was several hundred thousand years ago.

After several hundred thousand years, someone had once again opened a holy embryo.

People started to swarm into the shop where Huang Xiaolong was located, and they fought to get a glimpse of the holy embryo, as well as the lucky fellow who had found the embryo.

But these people were dumbfounded when they finally got on the stone guessing field and learned that Huang Xiaolong had actually got two embryos from one jade stone. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“One stone, two embryos?!”

If the last holy embryo’s appearance was several hundred thousand years ago, then how long had it been since someone had gotten two embryos in one stone? Was it several hundred million years ago?!

Both the owner and the shop’s assessors stared at the second embryo in speechless shock. Although they had not checked the second embryo, they could already confirm that the second embryo from Huang Xiaolong’s jade stone was a holy grade embryo, and it was most likely a mid-ranked holy grade embryo.

While everyone was caught in the excitement, the owner and assessors cautiously and gently started checking the second embryo, and they finally verified that the second embryo from Huang Xiaolong’s jade stone was peak mid-rank holy grade!

“How could this be?!” Wang Xin muttered dazedly, looking like he had lost his soul, “It’s actually two embryos in one stone! I don’t believe this, absolutely not!”

None of the Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciples made a noise.

The owner and others who had witnessed the whole thing looked at Wang Xin with pity.

Initially, it was something worth celebrating when Wang Xin had got a peak mid-rank xiantian grade embryo from his jade stone, and everyone present was resigned to Wang Xin winning the bet. But, who’d thought that Wang Xin would actually lose in the end!

As the spectators thought of the bet, even more pitying gazes fell on Wang Xin.

Wang Xin was a Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple. If he really had to strip himself down to his birthday suit and call himself an idiot, his reputation would stink more than the sewers, turning him into many sacred lands’ laughing stock.

The experts, who had rushed over recently, also learned of Wang Xin and Huang Xiaolong’s bet. Another wave of furor swept over them when they learned what was at stake. Some were looking at Wang Xin with weird gazes.

“Now, it is time for you to fulfill your part of the bet.” Huang Xiaolong looked at the despondent Wang Xin, sneering coldly, “Remember, not a single string of thread should be on your body, and you can’t take anything away!”

Wang Xin’s face was immediately distorted with fury.

“Also, break the legs of that dog-slave by your side!”

“Of course, you have to say you’re an idiot a hundred times in front of everyone, I think you haven’t forgotten about that, right?”

Wang Xin’s face turned uglier at those words.

“Punk, don’t take a foot after gaining an inch!” A Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple behind Wang Xin shouted angrily at Huang Xiaolong, “I don’t care about who you are, or what your connection with the Divination Creed is because this is the territory of our Dragon Fish Creed. Therefore, you better watch yourself and get the f*ck out of our face if you know what’s good for you!”

This Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple was the very same one who had insulted Huang Xiaolong earlier, pointing out that Huang Xiaolong was not qualified to make a bet with Wang Xin.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent, “And if I don’t know what’s good for myself?”

“Then we’ll break your dog legs and then summon your elders over to take you back!” The Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple snorted.

Despite knowing that Huang Xiaolong had some kind of background, the Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple did not put much importance on that point. After all, they were within the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, and he was a member of the Dragon Fish Creed’s Enforcement Hall. He had a family elder who was also an Enforcement Hall elder.

Huang Xiaolong snorted at the outer disciple’s words as his hand reached out and grabbed the outer disciple from across space and dragged him up to his front.

Although this Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple was also a Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor like Huang Xiaolong, he was as weak and powerless as an ant in front of him.

“Junior Brother Shi!” other Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciples shouted in alarm.

Wang Xin’s expression was ugly to the extreme as he glared at Huang Xiaolong, “Release Junior Brother Shi. He is our Enforcement Hall elder’s grandson. If anything happens to him, then don’t even dream of leaving the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave!”

All eyes were on Huang Xiaolong, while the shop owner cried in bitter helplessness in his heart. If a fight were to break out here between these two, then the first victim was undoubtedly going to be him.

“Did you hear that? Hurry up and let me go!” The Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple roared at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Wang Xin indifferently as he retorted, “It looks like you don’t plan to disrobe.”

Wang Xin’s face was darker than the stormy skies. “I’m telling you to let Junior Brother Shi go!’ His cold gaze swept over Duan Feng and Long Jianfei behind Huang Xiaolong as he warned, “I advise you better not make any foolish moves, or those two also won’t be able to protect you!”

Although Duan Feng was a mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor, the Dragon Fish Creed had more than twenty people on their side. Not to mention that a few of them were early Seventh Resurrection primal Ancestors, and they wouldn’t have a problem to completely suppress Duan Feng and Long Jianfei.

As for Huang Xiaolong, since he was only a peak late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, Wang Xin disregarded him completely. If it wasn’t for worrying about Huang Xiaolong’s identity, he would have acted when Huang Xiaolong captured his Junior Brother Shi.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong smiled coldly. Then, a shadow blurred and his foot landed hard on the Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple’s kneecaps. The sound of breaking bones was accompanied by a heart-wrenching wail.

Everyone was startled as no one had thought that Huang Xiaolong would really dare to injure a Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple.

Since he was capable of having a Divination Creed’s inner disciple as his follower, it was likely that Huang Xiaolong’s status was very high. But then again, one point couldn’t be disregarded that they were at the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, and the person in Huang Xiaolong’s hand was a younger generation of a Hall Enforcement’s elder, yet Huang Xiaolong really broke his legs…

As Wang Xin and the others’ expressions changed, Huang Xiaolong’s sharp voice rumbled in their ears, “Since you’re going to make a move, I’ll do it myself.”

With that said, Huang Xiaolong threw the Dragon Fish Creed’s disciple far into the distance, on the main street outside, and then, he walked towards Wang Xin.

“Since you refuse to do it yourself, I’ll help you!” Huang Xiaolong stated coldly.

Before Wang Xin registered Huang Xiaolong’s intention, the sight before him blurred and Huang Xiaolong was right in front of him. Wang Xin was taken aback but his response wasn’t slow at all as his fist swung out, “Get lost!”

To his horror, his fist was locked halfway by Huang Xiaolong’s palm!

“How come?!”

Wang Xin and many present experts stared wide-eyed with shock.

Wang Xin was a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm expert, whereas, Huang Xiaolong was only a peak late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

With Wang Xin’s fist within his palm, Huang Xiaolong lightly shook him and everything on Wang Xin’s body fell to the ground. Not only his Dragon Fish Creed inner disciple’s robe, but even his most intimate piece of clothing was on the ground.

A few people flushed red, while others were stunned looking at Wang Xin in his birthday suit.

He was really stripped naked!

“You, actually, die, die for me!”

Wang Xin raged as fury and embarrassment erupted in his heart. Killing intent surged, and his entire body’s dao energy rushed out, while his other fist punched out at Huang Xiaolong.
