Chapter 402: Arriving At the Center Oblast

The group slowly descended on a mountain peak.

“Both of you find it strange that I did not take the chance to kill Yang Liang and Yang Qing?” Huang Xiaolong noticed the puzzled look on Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s face, guessing the doubt they have.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong speak, both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu nodded.

Huang Xiaolong summarized in a simple sentence: “Our main enemy is Deities Templar.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu both were stunned at first and then nodded, understanding Huang Xiaolong’s meaning.

“But, Sovereign, after this incident, Deities Templar and Chen Tianqi would be aware of our movements very soon, knowing that we’ve arrived at Starcloud Continent.” Zhao Shu cautioned.

“I have never intended to cover our tracks.” Huang Xiaolong added, “I wanted to use this opportunity let Deities Templar and Chen Tianqi know that I have arrived at Starcloud Continent!” A sharp glint burst in the depth of Huang Xiaolong’s pupils as he said this.

Chen Tianqi!

Deities Templar!

He must kill Chen Tianqi! And Li Molin must die as well!

“Tonight, we’ll rest here.” Huang Xiaolong said looking at the darkening sky.

Zha Shu and Zhang Fu nodded.

Lil’ Tian chimed in, “Big brother, I’m going to hunt some Tyrant Boars!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled hearing Lil’ Tian’s words, nodded: “Good.” Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried about Lil’ Tian’s safety with his strength.

Tyrant Boars were Martial Spirit World’s lowest level demonic beasts, and were also the most common demonic beast. In most mountainous or forested areas, there would always be Tyrant Boars roaming around.

Huang Xiaolong had just built a fire, but Lil’ Tian was already back, carrying a few Tyrant Boars; one in each hand and two more on his shoulders.

Watching this scene, all three people laughed.

Soon, the aroma of roasted Tyrant Boar meat wafted in the air.

After dealing with the Tyrant Boar meat, Huang Xiaolong went into the Xumi Temple, observing the twelve crystal primordial divine dragon statues and practicing the Twelve Forms of the Dragon God.

At every moment, Huang Xiaolong’s body continued to absorb the true dragon essence released by the Dragon Pearl. True dragon essence could not only enhance one’s battle qi cultivation, it also strengthened their soul.

Hence, although Huang Xiaolong did not practice the Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate as much as he did in the past, his spiritual force continued to grow stronger every second of each passing day.

After one hour of observing the twelve crystal statues, Huang Xiaolong closed his eyes. The images of twelve primordial divine dragons emerged in his mind, constantly changing, and his hands mimicked their movements.

A punch, a palm, a claw... True dragon qi turned into shadows of real dragons in the Xumi Temple.

Huang Xiaolong, who was immersed in practicing the Twelve Forms of the Dragon God, felt an abrupt change in his Qi Sea.

“This is..?!” Huang Xiaolong stopped what he was doing, feeling dumbstruck. This was a sign that he was about to breakthrough to Fourth Order Saint realm!

Huang Xiaolong quickly sat down cross-legged in the center of the Ten Buddha Formation, simultaneously running the Asura Tactics and the Body Metamorphose Scripture to calm down the vigorous surging battle qi in his Qi Sea.

Saint Realm battle qi galloped in Huang Xiaolong’s meridians in brute force, causing sharp pain in every part of his body. Accompanying this sharp pain was the excruciating torture originating from his soul, as if there were tens of thousands of needles stabbing at his soul all at once.

Huang Xiaolong was afraid, but he held fast to his will, diverting the flow of his Saint Realm battle qi to break the Fourth Order Saint Realm barrier.

Half an hour went by.

Huang Xiaolong was entirely shrouded in a mist of true dragon qi, and his silhouette could hardly be seen inside. From time to time, a dazzling black light glimmered in the mist.

The black and blue twin dragons hovered above Huang Xiaolong’s head, emitting brilliant halos of black and blue.

He didn’t know how much time had passed when a crisp noise sounded from inside his body. His body shook as three different intense lights of gold, black, and ember-red flew skyward. Terrifying waves of energy crashed out again and again.

Gradually, these energy shockwaves dispersed and the true dragon qi returned to Huang Xiaolong’s body. A distinctive glint shone in Huang Xiaolong’s pupils as he opened his eyes. Sensing the abundant surging power flowing inside his body, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and punched the air.

Like a raging hurricane, the howling wind seemed neverending, followed by a thunderous boom some distance ahead. The power of Huang Xiaolong’s punch tore a hole in the fabric of space!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes twinkled with delight seeing this result. Just from this little test, he discovered that his strength increased at least five to six fold after breaking through to Fourth Order Saint realm.

Now, purely relying on the strength of his physical body, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he had sufficient power to kill an early Fifth Order Saint realm expert.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong noticed that after he broke through to Fourth Order Saint realm, the true essence energy inside his dantian underwent a transformation.

In the past, Huang Xiaolong’s true essence energy swirled above his dantian space, whereas now, it separated. No, it grouped into seven clouds. Although they seemed smaller, he clearly felt that the energy and power contained in these seven small true essence clouds were undoubtedly more lethal than before.

After checking the new changes in his body, Huang Xiaolong exited the Xumi Temple in a satisfied mood.

Outside, the sky was clear and bright, with the sun hanging right above their heads. It was already midday.

“Sovereign, you’re out!” Seeing Huang Xiaolong emerging, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu greeted.

Detecting the worry on their faces, Huang Xiaolong asked, “How long was I in closed-door practice this time?”

Zhang Fu replied: “Sovereign, this time, it has been eleven days!”

“Eleven days?!” Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded. He assumed that it would be seven days, at most, but he actually took eleven days.

“Sovereign, you, you broke through?!” Suddenly, Zhao Shu looked at Huang Xiaolong with a stupefied expression.

After it was pointed out by Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu also noticed that there was something different about Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong smiled sheepishly and nodded, “Yeah.”

Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were overjoyed. Getting down on a single knee, both congratulated in unison: “Congratulations to Sovereign for breaking into the Fourth Order Saint realm!”

Fourth Order Saint realm! Once one stepped into Fourth Order Saint realm, they were mid-level Saint realm experts, both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu knew very well what this meant.

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Come, stand up.”

Only then did the two of them rise to their feet.

At this time Lil’ Tian ran over to Huang Xiaolong’s side, saying, “Big brother, you’re out! Great, tonight we can eat Tyrant Boar meat!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Tonight, we’ll roast ten of them!”

“Ten!!” Lil’ Tian’s eyes sparkled like stars at Huang Xiaolong’s words.

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong’s group left the place, continuing on their way.

Several days later, they left the South Oblast territory.

...

The Asura’s Gate headquarters was located in the Central Oblast of Starcloud Continent. To reach the Central Oblast, Huang Xiaolong’s group had to travel through twenty cities across the South Oblast. With their speed, they would need two months to reach the Central Oblast.

Even though Starcloud Continent wasn’t filled with roaming demonic beasts, Huang Xiaolong’s group still maintained the same routine of traveling during the day while stopping to rest or cultivate at night.

One month later, Huang Xiaolong finally stabilized his recent breakthrough. During this one month, Huang Xiaolong had fully subjugated all thirty thousand Poison Corpse Scarabs from the Origin Forest.

Two months passed by.

In the air above a certain sea region located in the Central Oblast, lights flickered and the silhouettes of Huang Xiaolong, Lil’ Tian, and the rest appeared.

After a two month journey from the South Oblast, Huang Xiaolong’s group finally reached the Central Oblast territory.

This part of the sea was on the east side of the Central Oblast, named Peach Blossom Sea. The islands in this sea were filled with flowering peach blossoms, pink petals were carried out to the sea all year long, that was how the sea was named Peach Blossom Sea.

“Sovereign, one of our Asura’s Gate branches is on one of the islands in front, but the person in charge of this branch is Chen Tianqi’s confidante, Wang Gang.” Zhao Shu said.
