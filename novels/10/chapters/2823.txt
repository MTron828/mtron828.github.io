Chapter 2824: Purity Creed

When they were laughing and joking around, a massive explosion rang through the skies. The blast could be heard clearly through the Blue Heaven Creed.

To everyone’s surprise, they saw a man blowing a hole through the protective formation around the Blue Heaven Creed with a single punch before drifting down to the ground.

The disciples of the enforcement hall weren’t the only ones who were shocked. The one hundred disciples who were about to be sentenced to death also felt their jaws dropping to the ground.

The protective formation was actually broken by someone with a single punch?!

“Who… Who are you?!” A Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm expert of the enforcement hall asked when he noticed Huang Xiaolong flying towards them. When he noticed the cultivation level of the young man before him, he was stunned. Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm?!

A Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor shattered the formation protecting the Blue Heaven Creed’s headquarters! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

How is it possible?!

“I’m Huang Xiaolong.”

“Huang… Huang Xiaolong?!” The disciples of the enforcement hall stammered when saying his name.

As for the disciples of the Talisman Sacred Land, they were equally as shocked.

Even though Fu Daosheng had submitted to Huang Xiaolong and turned into his subordinate, Huang Xiaolong had never shown his face around the Talisman Sacred Land. This was the first time they were seeing him.

“It’s you!” The Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor sneered when he realized that the number one target of the Blue Heaven Creed was standing right before him. “Who would have thought that you would give yourself up by wandering straight into the headquarters of our creed! Hahaha, all the bounty out there is useless!”

“You don’t have to think about leaving today!”

A smirk formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he heard what he said. “Since I’m here today, I don’t plan on leaving.” He started walking towards the members of the enforcement hall as he spoke.

While everything was going down, Yi Beihang, Yan San, Wang Jin, Yi Xiaotang, and several others were chatting happily with a pair of youngsters in the main hall of the headquarters.

The young man and young lady were the young patriarch and the personal disciple of the Purity Creed, respectively.

Compared to the Blue Heaven Creed, the Purity Creed’s foundations were much deeper. The Purity Dao Venerable was a Third Esteem Dao Venerable, one entire realm stronger than Wang Jin!

When they felt the trembling around them, they couldn’t help but pause their conversation as all the laughter stopped.

A casual smile soon formed on the young man’s face. “It seems like someone else came to visit your Blue Heaven Creed other than us…”

A frown formed on the faces of the four Dao Venerables instantly. Who was gutsy enough to barge into their Blue Heaven Creed? Moreover, that person had to do it when the members of the Purity Creed were there for a visit. Were they planning to embarrass the Blue Heaven Creed in front of another superpower?

“Patriarch, I’ll go take a look,” Yan San got to his feet and spoke to Yi Beihang.

“Alright.”

Since the other party was daring enough to charge straight into their headquarters, there was no way he was a weakling. It would be for the best if the grand hall master personally went out to deal with the situation.

Before Yan San could leave the main hall, a grand elder rushed into the hall in panic and screamed, “Lord Patriarch, Huang Xiaolong… Huang Xiaolong is here!”

Huang Xiaolong!

Those from the Blue Heaven Creed stared at each other in shock.

As for the duo from the Purity Creed, they felt a trace of suspicion crawling into their minds when they saw the expression on the faces of Yi Beihang and the others. Who in the world is Huang Xiaolong? How could his appearance cause so much shock to the Dao Venerables of the Blue Heaven Creed?

Could it be a newly promoted half-step Dao Venerable?

Even so, why would the fully-fledged Dao Venerables care so much about him?

“Patriarch, why don’t I head over with Yan San?” Wang Jin spoke up all of a sudden.

He had been looking for a disciple for a long time, and this was the only person he had set his eyes on. He couldn’t allow Yan San to cripple the other party no matter what.

Yi Beihang hesitated for a moment. He wanted to head over with the two of them, but he couldn’t possibly leave the young patriarch of the Purity Creed alone in the hall as the leader of the Blue Heaven Creed!

“Patriarch Yi Beihang, since we’re here, let’s go over and take a look. We’re curious too,” the young patriarch of the Purity Creed suggested.

A look of shock appeared on the faces of everyone from the Blue Heaven Creed.

Yi Beihang felt a headache coming.

There was the Immemorial Treasury on Huang Xiaolong, and if the young patriarch of the Purity Creed followed them over, he could discover the secret. If he requested for a part of their loot, things might get troublesome.

“Is the Blue Heaven Dao Venerable unwilling?” Yu Sheng, the young patriarch of the Purity Creed stared at Yi Beihang with a deep look.

“Of course not! Since you’re planning to go take a look, let’s go together.” Yi Beihang sighed. A smile formed on his face. “Since this is something regarding my creed, I hope you will not get involved.”

A frown formed on Yu Sheng’s face, but he eventually nodded his head. “But of course…”

Under the lead of the Blue Heaven Creed, everyone made their way to the plaza.

Yu Sheng was followed by several experts of the Purity Creed, and he casually walked behind the rest.

By the time they arrived, Huang Xiaolong had snapped the neck of the last disciple of the enforcement hall.

In the plaza, the one hundred disciples destined to be executed stared at the corpses of those from the Blue Heaven Creed.

Every single corpse lying on the ground had their heads twisted off and thrown to the side.

That wasn’t all, their dao souls were taken away by Huang Xiaolong, and their dao hearts were incinerated with a single punch from the man.

Huang Xiaolong had not only barged into the headquarters of the Blue Heaven Creed, but he had also dared to kill their enforcers!

Turning around after he snapped the neck of the last person, Huang Xiaolong waved his arm to shatter the restrictions in the bodies of those from the Talisman Sacred Land.

“Go.”

Instead of leaving, the members of the Talisman Sacred Land stared at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws agape.

“Hurry up and leave this place.” A cold gaze flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Without waiting for them to react, he rose to the skies and flew towards the Dao Venerables of the Blue Heaven Creed.

Frosty light flashed in his eyes as he had discovered their presence a long time ago.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Yan San yelled when he caught sight of the man himself and killing intent filled his heart.

A weird light flashed in his eyes as he thought about how he should kill Huang Xiaolong during the battle that would break out later.

When Yu Sheng saw that the person they were so shocked to discover was a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor, he couldn’t hide the shock in his heart.

Very quickly, the group approached the Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor. When Yi Xiaotang looked at him, complicated emotions flashed in her eyes.

“Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor?” Yi Beihang and the others cried out in shock when they discovered that Huang Xiaolong had advanced in such a short amount of time.
