Chapter 2739: You Can’t Even Kill Me With Two Moves

When Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and the others heard what he said, they laughed in his face.

“When did we say that we are hired experts of the Cangqiong Sacred Land?” Duan Feng ridiculed.

Hou Ting, Zeng Changwang, and Yang Suda were stupefied.

Is that not the case?

“We only take orders from our Young Lord.” Long Jianfei added.

Again?! What is with them and their young master?!

The experts of the Ice Blue Sacred Land stared at Huang Xiaolong silently as they sized him up once again.

To be honest, they were not concerned about Huang Xiaolong even though he possessed enough strength to kill Chen Feng and Liu Man.

The more Hou Ting examined Huang Xiaolong, the more he felt that he was forgetting something important.

“Huang Xiaolong? Where’s He Ba and the others?! What’s with the disciples following behind you?! What witchery are you pulling?!”

He also discovered that Tang Jin and Yuan Yue were not present.

“He Ba? I gave them a chance to submit to me and become my slaves, but they refused. There wasn’t much else I could do other than to blow their physical bodies up,” Huang Xiaolong responded coldly.

Hou Ting and the others were curious as to what Huang Xiaolong would say, but everyone other than Hou Ting burst out laughing when Huang Xiaolong admitted it.

A frown formed on Hou Ting’s face. “Little brat, we’re not here to entertain you by listening to your jokes.”

Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to explain himself any further, and he announced, “Since all of you are here, I’ll cut the crap. You can either choose to serve me as my slave or end up like He Ba and the others!”

Zeng Changwang and Yang Suda laughed arrogantly.

Regardless, their reactions did not take Huang Xiaolong by surprise. He had experienced too many situations that played out the same way throughout his whole journey.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Brat, who the f*ck cares if you found some Primal Ancestors to call you ‘young lord’? Do you really think that you’re invincible?! Go take a piss and look at your reflection in it! You’re just a Ninth Heaven True Saint! You’re nothing but an ant in front of us! Hah! Killing you will take less than half a move!” Zeng Changwang scoffed unbearably.

It was clear that he had a giant misconception. According to what he thought, Huang Xiaolong had hired Duan Feng and the others to put on a show!

There was no way a high-level Primal Ancestor like Duan Feng would recognize Huang Xiaolong as his master!

In his opinion, they were all playing along with him.

It wasn’t strange for Zeng Changwang to think that way. After all, they would be crazy if they admitted that a high-level Primal Ancestor would behave subserviently towards a True Saint willingly.

Duan Feng and everyone else stared at Zeng Changwang when they heard what he said. Even if everyone present were to jump Huang Xiaolong, he would be able to deal with them in an instant!

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong smirked, “Kill me with half a move? Alright. Let’s see how strong you really are.” He waved his hands to signal Long Jianfei and Duan Feng to back off.

The Primal Ancestors backed away instantly.

Zeng Changwang and Hou Ting stared blankly at Duan Feng and the others.

A sinister smile formed on Zeng Changwang’s face, and he roared with laughter, “Since you have spoken, I won’t let you down! Don’t worry. I’ll definitely kill you!”

Hou Ting finally felt that something was off, and he quickly warned Zeng Changwang to be careful.

Pausing for a second, Zeng Changwang looked at Duan Feng and Mo Zhi who were standing not too far away. After listening to Hou Ting’s warning, he was afraid that they would launch a sneak attack on him.

“Relax, without my order, they won’t dare to butt in. Make your move,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Zeng Changwang chuckled, “You little brat, since you wish to die so much, I’ll grant your wish! A punch was sent towards Huang Xiaolong’s face the moment he spoke.

The Ice Blue Grand Dao Art was terrifying as it surged towards Huang Xiaolong like an unstoppable tidal wave.

Zeng Changwang was a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and he was the second strongest existence in the Ice Blue Sacred Land. Out of all the powers in the region, he was safely ranked in the top twenty! In order to kill Huang Xiaolong in an instant, he gave it his all and unleashed everything without holding back. He swore to blow Huang Xiaolong into pieces.

“Go to hell!”

Boom!

Zeng Changwang’s fist slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Hou Ting’s attention was always on Duan Feng and Mo Zhi, but he saw that they didn’t move a muscle even after Huang Xiaolong was struck! Instead, they looked at Zeng Changwang with a look of amusement on their faces. The Primal Ancestors who came with Hou Ting were flabbergasted.

What in the world was going on?!

Their eyes widened in shock when their gazes returned on Zeng Changwang and Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong remained where he stood, and he muttered, “I’m perfectly fine after the first move. However, I’ll let you try again.”

Releasing a desperate howl towards the skies, Zeng Changwang pushed himself past his limit. Rays of blue light emerged from his fist, and it caused the skies around them to dim a little.

Boom!

The second explosion rang louder than the first, and it jolted the entire sacred land.

Brushing off Zeng Changwang’s fist, Huang Xiaolong patted himself to remove the dust on his body. “You can’t even injure me with two moves…”

His voice rang in the heads of those from the Ice Blue Sacred Land.

“What?!” Hou Ting and Yang Suda yelled in fright.

As Zeng Changwang looked at Huang Xiaolong with his eyes widened in shock, Huang Xiaolong stared at him in amusement. “It’s my turn now.” With one punch, Zeng Changwang’s body was reduced to dust.

Spiritual qi that once filled Zeng Changwang’s body filled the skies, and there were many people who failed to dodge the golden blood that sprayed all around. They looked at Huang Xiaolong with blank expressions on their faces.
