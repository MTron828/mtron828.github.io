“It seems I cannot call you Xiaoniū anymore. In the future, I should call you Daniū.” [1]

“Daniū doesn’t sound nice, Xiaoniū sounds way better.” All of a sudden, a girlish voice sounded.

It was so abrupt that Huang Xiaolong stilled in alarm. His eyes cautiously scanned around before falling onto the little cow, his eyes widening in shock: “You talked?”

The little cow snorted proudly, its nose tilting upward, “Master, were you frightened? It’s nothing strange that I can talk.”

All divine beasts could speak the human language upon reaching a certain level of cultivation.

However, it had been less than two years since the little cow hatched from the egg, its sudden ability to talk bewildered Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “It’s simply fantastic that you can talk! You kept mooing at me, I really couldn’t understand what you were saying all this time.” Now that the little cow could speak, Huang Xiaolong’s dull days had come to an end, making it easier to communicate with it.

A giggle sounded, “That’s because Master is too dumb, that’s why you couldn’t understand my words.”

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes, then a thought flashed through his mind, “You know the origin of that tree branch we refined just now?”

The little cow nodded with a hint of complacence, “Of course I know. There are very few things in this universe that this great cow doesn’t know. That was a branch of the Dragon Realm’s congenital divine tree, the Ancestral Dragon Tree. The Ancestral Dragon is the lord of all dragons, one of the supreme masters of the chaos universe. Legend has it that this was originally nothing more than a common tree, but some Ancestral Dragon blood essence fell on it, nurturing it into the Dragon Realm’s congenital divine tree!”

Huang Xiaolong was shocked by this information, “That Ancestral Dragon Tree actually contains the Ancestral Dragon’s blood essence?!”

The little cow nodded. “Yes. A complete Ancestral Dragon Tree is a hundred thousand zhang tall, its trunk is bigger than this Jadeite Royal City, but the real treasure is its Ancestral Dragon Fruit. After consuming it, even an average Second Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator could breakthrough to peak late-Tenth Order in one go. As for you, probably Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes rounded with amazement, “One Ancestral Dragon Fruit could let me breakthrough all the way to Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm?!”

The little cow rolled its large eyes, “The Ancestral Dragon Tree only bears ten fruits every hundred million years, and each fruit contains the energy of the Ancestral Dragon’s blood essence, what’s so strange about helping you breakthrough to Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm? Not to mention the fact that there are so many more trees in the Divine World that are even more precious than the Ancestral Dragon Tree. It’s you who’s lacking in experience.”

‘Lacking in experience?’

Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned sullen like a sour grape, never had he imagined there would be a day when a cow would despise him for lacking experience.

“Master, your godhead’s rank should be above low grade king rank, right?” The little cow suddenly asked.

“You can tell?” Huang Xiaolong’s heart tightened.

The little cow shook its head, “I can only estimate that your it should be higher, as for what type of godhead it is, I cannot tell.”

Huang Xiaolong relaxed hearing that.

“But there’s something strange. How did the Ancestral Dragon Tree appear here in the Vientiane World Surface?” The little cow mumbled. “I wonder if there are any other parts of the Ancestral Dragon Tree here.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes brightened at that sentence.

If there were other Ancestral Dragon Tree branches on the Vientiane World Surface, then after refining them...! Just thinking of the possibility, a fire lit up in his heart.

At this time, his Barbarian God Sect inner disciple token trembled. Huang Xiaolong snapped out of his thoughts and took out the token from the Submerging Dragon ring.

His divine sense swept over the message within: “Three sects’ inner disciple training.” this message was sent by the Barbarian God Sect’s upper echelon, instructing all inner disciples to return to the sect and participate in the three sects’ joint training that would be held ten months later.

In the last part of the message, it was stated that other than those who had tasks on hand, the attendance was compulsory, otherwise they would be punished according to the sect rules.

A light glimmered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, ‘It looks like this three sects’ joint training is extremely important to the Barbarian God Sect, otherwise they wouldn’t have stated that the attendance is compulsory.’

With a deadline of ten months, there was ample time, hence Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to rush back. Based on his current speed, rushing back to the Barbarian God Sect from the Jadeite Kingdom would only take two or three months at most.

Huang Xiaolong took out the Zhenyu Sect map and began studying the terrain. Even though he had time, he preferred to find the Zhenyu Treasure as soon as possible.

Five days went by in a blink.

In these five days, Huang Xiaolong had covered all the mountain peaks within the Jadeite Royal City and its surrounding area, and following the clues on the map, he finally found an approximate location.

On the sixth day, Huang Xiaolong appeared on a mountain peak several thousand li outside the Jadeite Royal City.

There was a great cliff on this mountain, which was veiled by thick fog, moreover, Huang Xiaolong discovered that his divine sense seemed to be submerged into a sea after one thousand zhang down. Therefore, he couldn’t estimate how deep this cliff was.

The Zhenyu Sect’s treasury was right below this cliff.

Slight hesitation flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Then, riding on the little cow, the two of them jumped off, slowly flying downwards.

Barely a second later, their figures disappeared through the thick fog. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The moment Huang Xiaolong entered the layers of fog, dizziness hit him. This seemingly ordinary fog was actually poisonous! It even escaped his divine sense detection earlier.

Huang Xiaolong was alarmed, but swiftly circulated his godforce and eliminated the dizzy feeling. Surprisingly, the little cow didn’t seem affected at all by the fog, looking like it always did.

The lower they got, the thicker the fog became, while the air became bone-piercingly cold. After three hundred zhang, Huang Xiaolong had to create a godforce barrier over himself to withstand the coldness.

One thousand zhang later.

Huang Xiaolong saw thick layers of ice on the other side of the cliff wall. It was completely covered with vicious-looking frosty white icicles.

At this point, the average Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator would find it hard to withstand the startling coldness. Even Huang Xiaolong with his three supreme godheads was feeling burdened.

One thousand five hundred zhang later, Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that his blood was beginning to freeze, he was unable to feel his muscles.

Right at this time, a bright flash ran through the little cow’s body, causing the lightning symbols on its golden horns to flicker as purple-colored liquid was produced, forming a cocoon around Huang Xiaolong.

With the little cow’s barrier around him, Huang Xiaolong immediately felt the coldness receding from his body.

At one thousand six hundred zhang, his feet finally touched the ground.

The ground at the bottom of the ice cliff wasn’t very big, merely several hundred li. This place was covered in a veil of white ice, even the ground was covered with a thick layer of ice close to thirty meters thick!

Just the ice layer was already thirty meters thick, and the Zhenyu Sect’s Treasury was supposed to be underground, how was he supposed to find it?

Give him several years’ time and it would still be a herculean task just to get rid of the thick layer of ice.

Suddenly, the little cow walked toward a certain point. “Master, here!” The little cow called out happily.
