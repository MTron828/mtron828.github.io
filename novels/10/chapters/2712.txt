Chapter 2713: The Divine Tuo Holy World is Boundless!

Yin Ming’s escape dulled the excitement in the hearts of those present.

However, Huang Xiaolong soon retrieved a nascent holy fruit for Long Jianfei to heal his injuries. Shortly after that, Huang Xiaolong managed to locate Fei Yanzi with Duan Feng’s assistance.

By the time he found her, she was reaching her limit. The expression on her face was one of pain, and Huang Xiaolong quickly reached out to help her. With his assistance, he finally managed to suppress the Yin Borer Poison Yin Ming had inflicted on her.

The part that shocked him was the fact that even with his assistance, he didn’t manage to get rid of the Yin Borer Poison in her body completely. The best he could do was to suppress it.

“One needs Yin Ming’s blood essence in order to get rid of the poison?!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked when he received Duan Feng’s explanation on getting rid of the poison.

“Yes.” Duan Feng nodded in affirmation. Even someone like him couldn’t do a thing about it. He was stronger than the Yin Borer King, but he couldn’t neutralize the special poison belonging to the other party.

The only way to deal with the poison in Fei Yanzi’s body was to extract Yin Ming’s blood essence the next time they crossed hands.

A frown slowly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Doesn’t that mean that we need to capture the Yin Borer King?

“Xiaolong…” Fei Yanzi’s soft voice rang in his ears, “I’m fine… You don’t have to worry about me.”

After supporting her to get up on her feet, Huang Xiaolong knew that her body was extremely weak after enduring the poison for such a long time.

“Right now, the Yin Borer Poison has been suppressed. As long as you don’t enter a fierce battle with other Primal Ancestors, nothing should happen to you,” Duan Feng spoke up at the side.

Fei Yanzi’s complexion paled a little. If she couldn’t challenge other Primal Ancestors, wouldn’t that mean that she was completely useless?

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank. A Primal Ancestor was no different from a cripple if she couldn’t use her grand dao energy. It was something extremely hard to accept.

As such, he made up his mind to force Yin Ming out from whichever hole he was hiding in.

It didn’t take long for the three of them to emerge from the place she was trapped in.

While Mo Zhi and the others went up to welcome Huang Xiaolong with a triumphant expression, the ancestors of the other races didn’t fare so well. A look of terror could be seen on their faces as they slowly made their way towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Mansion Master Huang…” The Golden Nest Ancestor was the first to speak up. Gathering all his courage, he walked up to Huang Xiaolong and bowed, “Elder Ming lied to us previously, and we made a mistake! We didn’t mean to submit to the Yin Borer Race, and we only did it because we had no choice! Please show mercy to us lowly beings!” Of course, words weren’t the only thing he used to appease Huang Xiaolong’s anger. “This is the treasure of my Golden Nest Race!”

After speaking, he handed over something that looked like a bowl.

“Starry Treasure Bowl!” Long Jianfei and the others were shocked when they looked at the item.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart shook slightly as he was surprised to see the Starry Treasure Bowl. It was a heavenly treasure that was said to be lost in the river of time, and it was said to be able to gather the energy of the stars up in the nine heavens. When enough energy was gathered, the Nine Heavens Star Fluid would be formed, and even though it wasn’t comparable to grand dao springs formed naturally, it was something extremely hard to come by! One could use it to refine top-grade holy pills and even a dao artifact embryo!

Of course, one could also swallow the Nine Heavens Star Fluid for cultivation. Its effects were far better than most of the top-grade holy pills out there.

No one could have thought that the Starry Treasure Bowl had fallen in the hands of the Golden Nest Ancestor. But now, he finally revealed it, and he even tributed it to Huang Xiaolong to gain forgiveness…

The Conch Phoenix Ancestor quickly walked forward to do the same. “Mansion Master Huang, this is the treasure of my Conch Phoenix Race!” He retrieved an object and passed it over to Huang Xiaolong. It looked a little like a flute, but one of its ends was extremely narrow and pointy.

“Dark Phoenix Needle!”

Everyone was shocked once again.

The Dark Phoenix Needle was a type of musical instrument at the dao artifact level.

Legends had it that if one used a secret method to play a melody with the Dark Phoenix Needle, it would transform into a weapon that could pierce through even Primal Ancestors.

The ancestors of the various races soon presented the treasures they possessed to Huang Xiaolong in hopes of receiving a pardon.

Even with his status as the ex-Mansion Master of the Otherworldly Mansion, Mo Zhi was shocked at the sheer amount of treasures appearing before them.

Huang Xiaolong eventually addressed the Primal Ancestors when they handed over all their treasures.

…

Even though he accepted the treasures they presented and spared their lives, Huang Xiaolong mentioned that he would pick out another treasure from the treasury from the various races in the future.

He might not need anything from their treasuries, but he could use it to stock up on the treasures on the Otherworldly Mansion and the Dragon Fish Race. Obtaining additional treasures would also boost his forces.

The ancestors of the various races felt as though their hearts were bleeding, but they had no choice but to agree.

After leaving a brand in the dao souls of the various Primal Ancestors, Huang Xiaolong ordered for them to use everything in their power to locate the Yin Borer King, Elder Ming, and Yuan Baifei.

At the same time, he started to consolidate the power he had in World River and Alien Lands.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

With the coordination of Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, Long Shengtian, Jiang Heng, and the other ancestors, Huang Xiaolong managed to gather his power extremely quickly. The superpowers in the World River and Alien Lands soon gathered around him.

Changing the name of the Otherworldly Mansion to the Blue Dragon Manor, he appointed Mo Zhi as the Vice Mansion Master. As for the various superpowers and royal families, they became the branches of the Blue Dragon Manor!

From that moment on, the World River and Alien Lands were no longer separate entities!

As for the ancestors of the Prison Gateway and Ghost Tuo Race who hid themselves in the deepest regions of the World River, Huang Xiaolong paid them a personal visit and beat them half to death. When they begged for mercy, Huang Xiaolong conveniently added the Prison Gateway and the Ghost Tuo Race into the Blue Dragon Manor.

As for the Yin Borer Race, Huang Xiaolong showed them no mercy. Even though the Yin Borer King had escaped, he couldn’t bring the entire race with him! With a single order, Long Jianfei started to swallow the power possessed by the Yin Borer Race. Those who refused to submit were killed, and the others became outer disciples of the Dragon Fish Race. When Huang Xiaolong met Long Xiang again, he instantly killed the other party with a single slap.

After dealing with the Yin Borer Race, Huang Xiaolong passed down several orders to Mo Zhi and the others before entering seclusion. He was planning to enter the Eighth Heaven True Saint Realm as quickly as he possible.

Sitting under the Tree of Grand Dao, Huang Xiaolong started to circulate the Grandmist Parasitic Medium as he swallowed the grand dao energy all around him.

It didn’t take long before Long Jianfei and the others noticed the arrival of the dao tribulation.

Of course, it was several times more terrifying than his seventh tribulation. Despite his strength, Duan Feng’s expression changed when he noticed the energy gathered in the clouds above them.

As the eighth tribulation fell, the entire region shook.

“If this keeps up, the Alien Lands might not be able to withstand the future tribulations,” Long Jianfei muttered to himself.

“It’s alright! We’ll head over to the Divine Tuo Holy World soon! The Divine Tuo Holy World is boundless!”

Indeed, the Divine Tuo Holy World was large enough to withstand the energy fluctuations produced by Huang Xiaolong’s tribulations.

When Long Jianfei thought about the Divine Tuo Holy World, he felt as though a huge rock was lifted off his chest.

If Huang Xiaolong took on his tribulations in the Divine Tuo Holy World, the Dao Venerables all around might be alarmed…

“I wonder, how my master is doing?” Long Jianfei thought about his master back in the Divine Tuo Holy World all of a sudden. For him to advance into the Primal Ancestor Realm, he would be lying if he said that no one had guided him along. He thought of his master back in the Dragon Fish Creed and a sigh escaped his lips. He wondered if his master would still remember a disciple like him who had disappeared for such a long time.
