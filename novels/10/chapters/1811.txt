As Huang Xiaolong and his two odd beasts got closer to the Fiend King Star, more than a couple of powerful auras locked onto Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Sensing these powerful auras, Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he flew onward.

However, the closer Huang Xiaolong got to the Fiend King Star, the surrounding’s nefarious qi grew increasingly dense and intense akin to a boundless chaos pool of concentrated nefarious qi pressing on one’s chest until they could hardly breathe. Even someone as strong as Huang Xiaolong felt coercive pressure.

At one point, this nefarious qi pressed against Huang Xiaolong’s body like several floors of chaos mountain, forcing him to circulate his supreme godheads’ godforce to withstand the surrounding nefarious qi.

As the distance between him and the Fiend Star King narrowed, Huang Xiaolong’s face grew solemn gradually.

Based on his current strength and the heart of hell, there were not many things that could give him a sense of danger; however, the Fiend King Star gave him a sense of danger.

At this distance, Huang Xiaolong could clearly sense that the seemingly infinite nefarious qi had reached an indescribable degree. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Through billions of years of forging with dark and nefarious items by several generations of Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestors, one could imagine the terror of Fiend Star King. Venture too deep, and even high-level Emperor Realm experts risked being corroded by the dense nefarious qi, and their minds being controlled!

It was not hard to imagine one’s ending after being controlled by nefarious qi.

Huang Xiaolong’s group stopped a hundred thousand li from the Fiend King Star and did not fly closer.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had suddenly stopped flying forward, the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestors stayed hidden in the surroundings, seemingly competing over who could remain calm longer with Huang Xiaolong.

The world was unusually quiet.

Huang Xiaolong stood with his hand behind his back, his Eye of Hell opened and surveyed his immediate surroundings.

A while later, the dense nefarious qi around the Fiend King Star roiled like bubbling water, spreading out in the four directions, declaring its territory.

Simultaneously, the nefarious qi formed a giant arm that stretched out towards Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother dodging the outstretched arm coming at him. He circulated godforce from his Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead. Pure buddhist energy rose, condensing into golden Buddhas that sat in circles around Huang Xiaolong.

However, the nefarious qi hand enlarged and continued to reach for Huang Xiaolong as if the golden Buddhas around Huang Xiaolong did not exist.

Golden lights gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and buddhist energy instantly flooded forward, colliding with the giant nefarious qi palm.

Z-zi-i!

Sharp exploding noises resounded. Against the purifying power of Huang Xiaolong’s Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead’s godforce, the nefarious qi hand scattered at a rapid pace. However, the nefarious qi seemed neverending as more of it flooded out from the Fiend King Star. The giant nefarious hand continued to be purified by Huang Xiaolong’s godforce, yet it continued to condense simultaneously.

No matter how startling the nefarious qi was, it could not enter within a hundred li radius from Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong sneered.

As long as the nefarious qi hand could not enter within a hundred li from him, it couldn’t harm Huang Xiaolong, no matter how startling it was.

While Huang Xiaolong was fighting against the giant nefarious qi hand, a piercing sword qi suddenly slashed towards Huang Xiaolong from the void on the side.

World-shaking sword qi raised a sword qi wave over ten thousand li high as if a sword-river had suddenly appeared in the dark space.

This sword slash contained the profound power of heaven and earth’s esoteric, enough to reduce a Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert into blood mist in an instant.

However, when the sword qi got closer to Huang Xiaolong, one of the odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong instantly made its move. With a slap of its claw, it easily dispersed the lethal sword qi; the force rushed forward and disappeared into the void. A loud boom rang in the next second, and a figure was blown out from the void. This figure belonged to the attacker, the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Liu Yuan.

But when one of the odd beasts retaliated, four murderous sword qis slashed at Huang Xiaolong from the other side of the void. Each sword qis was as powerful as Liu Yuan’s sword attack.

The four sword qis resembled four fierce dragons locked onto Huang Xiaolong with world-destroying momentum, blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path of retreats from left to right, and from up and down.

The remaining odd beast roared as it slapped out with both claws. Frenzy force slammed onto the four sword dragons.

The four sword dragons scattered into energy, and the claw force disappeared into the void. Four consecutive booms sounded, and in the next second, four figures stumbled out from the void with shocked expressions, looking at the monster.

These four people had the same level of strength as Liu Yuan, late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts. Within the Fiend God Emperor Palace, the four of them were amongst the top ten strongest experts. Even so, Huang Xiaolong’s monster had easily shattered their combined efforts, kicking them out from the void in a sorry state.

“Very good, as expected of the Senior King of Darkness’ invincible Four Gods of War that terrified the Divine World in the past!” A voice filled with appreciation came from the purgatory of nefarious qi. This voice embodied malevolence, pulling others into boundless nefarious purgatory with his voice.

Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded in flickering radiant light as he looked ahead and saw a massive figure concealed within a nefarious light leap out from the Fiend King Star. It arrived a hundred li in front of Huang Xiaolong in a single leap.

When this massive figure enshrouded in nefarious light appeared, the nefarious qi within this space roiled in excitement and ecstasy.

The massive figure exuded a powerful momentum comparable to the four odd beasts.

This was the Fiend God Emperor, Feng Chu!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed—only the Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu could have such momentum and fiendish aura.

With the Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu’s appearance, the experts hidden in the surrounding all came out consecutively. Each person exuded a strong and powerful aura.

No doubt, these were the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestors, a total of one hundred and seventy-eight people!

After these Emperor Realm Ancestors’ appearance, another group of people appeared, consisting of the Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple Feng Chan, Wang Yongsen, and other Fiend God Emperor Palace’s supreme rank godhead geniuses.

“Greetings, Emperor!”

Liu Yuan and the other Ancestors, as well as Feng Chan’s group all, knelt respectfully in salute.

Feng Chu nodded, and his majestic voice sounded, “Stand up.”

Feng Chan and the others stood up.

“Huang Xiaolong, I have to say that I’m genuinely surprised that you really have the guts to come to my Fiend God Emperor Palace.” Feng Chu’s voice sounded again from the massive figure enshrouded in nefarious light. His words echoed in space, reaching over a hundred million li. There was a gleam of crimson in his obsidian pupils, like the devil himself. “Not even your Senior Brother Jiang Hong dares to venture in here recklessly.”

Huang Xiaolong was unaffected by Feng Chu’s momentum at all, “I’ve been to places that are more dangerous, it’s just the Fiend God Emperor Palace.”

Liu Yuan and the others glared at Huang Xiaolong in outrage at his casual retort about the Fiend God Emperor Palace.

Feng Chu sneered, “You do have some guts, but by entering here today, don’t think you would be able to escape.”

Huang Xiaolong replied nonchalantly, “Since I dare to come here, I naturally never thought of running.”

Feng Chu smiled meaningfully as he shook his head, “I have to admit, the two odd beasts behind you are very powerful, but they are still not existences that have surpassed the Emperor Realm. They can protect you today. Once the Grand Fiend God Formation is activated, only the existence that has surpassed the Emperor Realm is capable of escaping!”

The moment his voice fell, numerous malevolent giant arms appeared from space’s horizon. On the surface of these massive arms were glimmering devilish runes, blocking all paths of escape.
