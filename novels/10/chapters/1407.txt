“All rise!” Xu Baisheng could barely contain his excitement when he met the three disciples of Void Devil Beast Clan. After being suppressed under the Devil Prison Mountain he was meeting them after several billion years as he had been suppressed under the Devil Prison Mountain for a very long time.

The three void devil beasts complied respectfully before coming to a stand.

Just as Xu Baisheng was going to ask why the three of them were besieged by the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace, and Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace, roaring soundwaves and overwhelming pressure suddenly roiled towards them from the distant starry space.

Everyone’s nerves were stretched taut by the sudden assault.

“It’s the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s experts!” The three void devil beasts shouted in unison, with horror-struck expressions.

“Get back inside the flying ship and leave this place right away!” Huang Xiaolong ordered swiftly.

The rest responded, and hastened into the Giant Shark Flying Ship. The three void devil beasts followed closely behind Xu Baisheng.

“Push the flying ship’s core formation to the limit!” Huang Xiaolong barked an order.

Through the days spent together, Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng had developed a tacit understanding. They cooperated seamlessly and raised the flying ship’s speed to the limit. The Giant Shark Flying Ship shuttled forward, and disappeared from the spot in a split second.

Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng activated all of the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s defensive formations as it turned invisible and merged with the space.

Not long after the Giant Shark Flying Ship left, four figures arrived at the scene with wind whistling on their tails.

As soon as these four people arrived, they could smell the faint rusty blood-scent and the four Emperor Palaces’ experts’ remnant auras; their faces darkened with fury.

“Damn!” One of them swore.

“Someone actually dared to kill our Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s disciples! Die, die, die!”

“Issue an order to lockdown the surrounding space. The murderer must be found!”

“Once we catch that person, I’ll make that person understand the terrifying consequences of killing my Solitude Emperor Palace’s disciples! I’m going to annihilate his whole tribe!”

The four experts’ angry swearing seemed endless.

The four Emperor Palaces’ disciples that Xiang Xun had annihilated were all respective Emperor Palaces’ genius disciples, and each one was related to the four Emperor Palaces’ Elders in one way or the other. They were bound to be punished if they failed in finding the murderers!

The four figures flickered into a blur, chasing after Huang Xiaolong.

However, half a day later, they failed to find any clues of Huang Xiaolong’s whereabouts.

......

The Giant Shark Flying Ship continued to fly forward in the vast space towards the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.

The flying ship’s core formation was going through low grade-eight spirit stones at an alarming speed. Maintaining a top-grade chaos flying ship at its fastest speed at all times naturally consumed a shocking amount of spirit stones with every passing second.

However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t concerned about this.

The three void devil beasts stared dumbfoundedly at the rapidly disappearing piles of low grade-eight spirit stones, feeling dryness in their throats.

“Xu Baisheng, lead them to the cultivation rooms. The spiritual energy gathering formations inside these rooms will help heal their injuries faster.” Huang Xiaolong said to Xu Baisheng.

“Yes, Master!” Xu Baisheng choked slightly, as he was extremely grateful to Huang Xiaolong.

Master...?!

The three void devil beasts looked at Huang Xiaolong, clearly astounded by what they heard.

However, the three of them wisely did not ask any questions and obediently followed Xu Baisheng. Each chose a cultivation room and entered them respectively. Then swallowed the chaos healing pills that Xu Baisheng had given them to start the healing process.

The Giant Shark Flying Ship flew onwards at high speed.

Roughly two weeks later, the Giant Shark Flying Ship passed by a deserted planet. Huang Xiaolong and the others could finally sighed in relief, as no one was chasing them.

They had successfully broken away from the four Emperor Palaces’ forces’ lockdown and pursuit by flying at a high speed in the Giant Shark Flying Ship.

As they had maneuvered their way out, they had seen the four Emperor Palaces’ flying ships patrolling and searching for them along the way.

A day had passed since they had seen any of the four Emperor Palaces’ flying ships. Therefore, they could dare to assume that they were safe.

However, as a precaution, Huang Xiaolong had Xiang Xun fly the ship at the fastest speed.

Another ten days passed when the Giant Shark Flying Ship stopped above an uninhabited planet.

The three void devil beasts injuries had healed significantly after almost a month of healing inside the cultivation room, along with using the chaos grade healing pills. At least, they no longer looked miserable from the outside.

“Master!” Xu Baisheng led the three void devil beasts and saluted Huang Xiaolong respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at Xu Baisheng, then looked at the three void devil beasts standing behind Xu Baisheng. He asked their names and why the four Emperor Palaces’ experts were besieging them.

All three hesitated and looked at Xu Baisheng for help.

Xu Baisheng strongly replied, “What the Master asks, you answer, no need to conceal anything.”

The three of them compiled at Xu Baisheng’s command.

The three introduced themselves to Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the others. Their names were Xu Ying, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi. They also recounted all the details about why the four Emperor Palaces’ experts were besieging them... Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Several million years ago, the Void Devil Beast Clan’s Old Ancestor had suddenly left the clan, claiming that he had wanted to go look for something in the Divine World’s Devil Abyss.

But the Void Devil Beast Clan’s Old Ancestor had sunk into the Devil Abyss without any news for several million years.

Following this tragedy, a rumor had circulated in Hell’s Aura World that the Void Devil Beast Clan’s Old Ancestor had fallen into the Devil Abyss.

Due to this, the Void Devil Beast Clan was repeatedly harassed by its enemies, weakening the clan over time. In several million years, the clan was stripped down from a hegemon force in the Hell’s Asura World to a second-rank force.

However, not long ago, two of Void Devil Beast Clan’s powerful enemies, Black Ant Clan and Demonic Bone Clan had joined forces to attack the Void Devil Beast Clan, to completely wipe them out.

The Void Devil Beast Clan that was reduced to a second-rank force was unable to withstand the Black Ants Clan and Demonic Bone Clan’s attacks. Numerous Void Devil Beast Clan’s disciples were injured and had died, while only a handful of disciples had managed to escape. But these disciples could no longer stay in Hell’s Asura World, thus they had to leave and find refuge in another world.

The three of them and quite a few of the Void Devil Beast Clan’s disciples had fled to the Divine World.

They originally had planned to migrate in order to improve their cultivation, and find an opportunity to avenge their clan. But not long after they had come to the Divine World, disciples of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace, and Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace found them.

Every part of a void devil beast was a treasure; their blood and the beast core could be used to refine top-grade chaos spiritual pills. Their skin and bones were rare materials to forge top-grade chaos spiritual armors, therefore, they were hunted by the four Emperor Palaces’ experts.

As the three went on, their voices choked intermittently. Tears were running down from Xu Baisheng’s eyes.

Xu Baisheng clenched his paws, a violent murderous aura surged from his body as he bellowed to vent the angst in his heart.

Black Ant Clan!

Demonic Bone Clan!

Also the Solitude Emperor Palace, Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace, and Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace!

It was hard to control the storm of emotions for Xu Baisheng after learning that his clan was annihilated.

Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Xiang Xun, Feng Er, and the others were dismayed and despondent. A heavy silence filled the hall.

One of the three void devil beasts, Xu Yong cried woefully, “In the beginning, there were still more than three hundred of us, but in the last few years, the four Emperor Palaces have killed most of our kins, and now, there’s only the three of us left. The others either died at the hands of the four Emperor Palaces’ experts or died after they were captured and taken back to the four Emperor Palaces!”
