The banquet lasted for a whole day.

During the banquet, Huang Xiaolong briefly recounted the events on Yaochi Mountain and he asked about the Huang Clan Manor’s situation these past years.

Everyone was excited, each trying to get a word in.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong had more or less understood the events that happened in Martial Spirit World while he was away.

It could be said that Martial Spirit World had been progressing well, no catastrophic events happened despite suffering several small-scale attacks over the years. But with Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, Phoenix Clan Ancestor, and the other Highgod Realm masters around, these attackers were unable to harm the Huang Clan Manor.

“Small-scale attacks?” Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi.

The old dragon explained, “They were people from the Azure Dragon Institute. Other than them, there were the Vermilion Bird Institute, White Tiger Institute, as well as a few other super forces. However, those people were all small shrimps, three batches in all, there were no further attacks after I obliterated all of them.”

At the mention of the Azure Dragon Institute, a cold light glinted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The Azure Dragon Institute came attacking the Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong knew what they were plotting without needing to think.

Years ago, on the Yaochi Mountain battle stage, he took out twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones to bet with the Azure Dragon Institute Principal, this much wealth had attracted various people’s greed.

Soon, the banquet ended.

Huang Xiaolong returned to his yard, but unlike usual, he didn’t plan to spend the night in cultivation. Instead, he took out the Yaochi Furnace to refine a batch of Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pills.

Even though Saint Mother Yao Chi left some Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pills to him before ascending to the Divine World, it wasn’t much. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong didn’t have the time to refine any before this, therefore he decided to refine a big batch for his family and the others in the Huang Clan Manor.

Moreover, he would be leaving soon to search for the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head and legs. At that time, he wouldn’t have time to refine pills.

In the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong had been refining for two months straight.

Due to Huang Xiaolong’s alchemy speed, he was able to refine two batches a day. Moreover, there was a hundred percent success rate, each and every pellet was of top grade. If other Alchemist Masters found out about this, their jaws would drop to the floor dumbstruck.

It was common knowledge that refining sacred grade divine pellets had a low success rate. Even if it was a low sacred grade divine pellet, one could hardly say for sure that there would be one success in ten attempts, what’s more a legendary sacred grade divine pellet like the Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pill.

Not even the Ascending Moon Old Man could achieve a hundred percent success rate like Huang Xiaolong. After all, he possessed neither the Black Tortoise Divine Fire nor the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire.

Two months later, Huang Xiaolong had his family and close confidants over, giving each of them two bottles of Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pills.

Although two bottles for each person wasn’t a lot, based on their cultivation speed it was sufficient to last them twenty to thirty years. When they finished them, he would just refine more.

While Huang Xiaolong was refining batches of Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pills for the last two months, Shi Xiaofei cane to his yard every day. After she arrived, she didn’t disturb Huang Xiaolong, she would stand at the side, watching him.

For her, being able to stay by Huang Xiaolong’s side, accompanying him, watching him, filled her with happiness.

Every time Huang Xiaolong successfully refined a batch, Shi Xiaofei would bring tea and dab off the sweat on his face.

After spending two months refining the Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pil2l for his family, Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to leave again and search for the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head and legs just yet, as he rarely had time to accompany his parents or Shi Xiaofei. This time around, Huang Xiaolong, his family, and Shi Xiaofei traveled around Martial Spirit World. At the same time, they were inspecting Martial Spirit World’s overall situation.

Huang Xiaolong also gave the Phoenix Clan Ancestor one hundred thousand high divine grade spirit stones and had him as well as the other Highgod Realm masters construct a transmission array in Martial Spirit World.

The truth is, constructing a transmission array didn’t need such a large amount of high divine grade spirit stones. Generally, medium-sized transmission arrays required about a thousand high divine grade spirit stones.

One could imagine the grandeur of a transmission array constructed using one hundred thousand high divine grade spirit stones, thus, the several Highgod Realm masters shuddered hearing that.

According to their knowledge, even the Cloudsea Mainland’s grand scale transmission array construction merely cost thirty thousand high divine grade spirit stones. The Cloudsea Mainland’s transmission array was already the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s largest transmission array.

Not to mention the fact that constructing a transmission array was a laborious and complicated task. Despite having the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, the three Peng Brothers, and Nine-Tailed White Fox, it would still take more than a year’s time to complete.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind the amount of time it would take, he wasn’t in a hurry to use the transmission array anyway.

He accompanied his family and Shi Xiaofei in touring the Martial Spirit World’s three big continents and the Bedlam Lands. By the time they finished, three months had passed.

After making a round of inspection, Huang Xiaolong was inwardly satisfied with the current progress.

In the last few decades, with the various spirit pellets that Huang Xiaolong rewarded them, and due to the improvement of Martial Spirit World’s spiritual energy, the number of people breaking into the Saint realm had steadily increased.

Just in the last ten years or so, the Martial Spirit World’s Saint realm experts had almost increased by tenfold!

Huang Xiaolong remembered that there used to be merely two to three thousand Saint Realm experts, but now that number had surpassed twenty thousand.

On this day, Huang Xiaolong summoned all the Highgod Realm masters.

“Master wants to recruit a batch of Highgod Realm masters?” Listening to Huang Xiaolong’s words, the Phoenix Clan Ancestor and the others were stunned.

They had heard about recruiting some super forces’ masters as their own family’s Guest Elders, but they had never heard of recruiting Highgod Realm masters as Guest Elders!

A Highgod Realm master stood at the pinnacle of strength in the galaxy, each one was an existence that could call the wind and summon rain. Who would be willing to be ordered by orders?

Watching the Phoenix Clan Ancestor and the others’ expressions, Huang Xiaolong could guess what was going through their minds, saying, “Release an announcement saying that First Order Highgod Realm masters who are willing will be given one hundred high divine grade spirit stones on an annual basis. Second Order Highgod Realm will receive two hundred high divine grade spirit stones annually, Third Order Highgod Realm masters three hundred a year, and so forth!”

The six Highg0d Realm masters before Huang Xiaolong were awestruck.

One year, one hundred high divine grade spirit stones!

One high divine grade spirit stone was valued at 80 million Xuanwu coins. A hundred pieces, 800 million?!

In ten years, that was 800 billion?! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

800 billion!

How many years did a super force need in order to accumulate such an astronomical wealth of 800 billion? Yet, being hired by for Huang Xiaolong for ten years, one could gain that much in ten years.

No Highgod Realm master could resist this temptation.

The six of them could already envision the scene of numerous Highgod Realm masters that secluded themselves inside mysterious spaces rushing into Martial Spirit World after this matter was announced.

Although Martial Spirit World currently had Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, and the others watching over it, Huang Xiaolong still felt that Martial Spirit World’s overall defenses were on the weaker side.

That mysterious Great Lord gave Huang Xiaolong a nagging sense of unease. This was why he decided to use high divine grade spirit stones to recruit some Highgod Realm masters, to strengthen Martial Spirit World’s line of defense.

With his current strength and soul force, there was no difficulty for him to control Highgod Realm masters using a soul mark. Unfortunately, these Highgod Realm masters were scattered all over the galaxy. Moreover, there were those that secluded themselves in mysterious places. It was troublesome to go looking for them one by one.

Now, using the method of recruiting, having these Highgod Realm masters coming right to his doorstep, things would be much simpler.

“That is all, go and handle it.” Huang Xiaolong spoke.

“Yes, Master!” Phoenix Clan Ancestor and the others respectfully complied and retreated from the hall, instructing their subordinates to announce the matter to the outside world.
