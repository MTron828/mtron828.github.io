Chapter 2696: Yin Borer Race

That was only Huang Xiaolong’s seventh dao tribulation! It was comparable to the seventh tribulation experienced by a Primal Ancestor!

They were separated by one entire realm! Nine levels of cultivation realm!

Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the dao tribulation didn’t fall the moment the tribulation clouds gathered. Instead, it rolled about and strengthened itself for nearly four months before finally descending.

Boom!

The moment the first bolt of lightning fell, the regions around the Otherworldly Mansion trembled.

A feeling of despair and desperation filled the hearts of every living creature, and they felt as though the world was ending.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The second, third, and fourth bolt fell in succession.

Long Jianfei and the others couldn’t take their eyes off the bolts of lightning falling towards Huang Xiaolong’s location.

“This… Even Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestors wouldn’t be able to withstand such power!” Long Shengtian gasped in shock.

Since he had refined the nascent holy fruit, he had managed to make a full recovery. The other Primal Ancestor of the Otherworldly Mansion had done the same, and the two of them were basically back at their peak strength.

“Will Xiaolong be in danger?” Mo Zhi turned to the others and asked.

In the past few years, he had managed to obtain news that Yuan Qianxing had already been captured by Huang Xiaolong. Knowing that Elder Ming had escaped, he had rushed back to the Otherworldly Mansion from the World River.

“Relax. Nothing will happen to the Young Lord.” Long Jianfei sighed. Even though he was a little afraid of the tribulation lightning falling on Huang Xiaolong, he was confident that Huang XIaolong would be able to withstand them all.

After all, he had the Huang Long Bloodline flowing in his veins!

How could Huang Xiaolong, the descendant of the God of Creation, die to a mere dao tribulation?!

Even after several days of bombardment, the dao tribulation showed no signs of stopping.

“Don’t tell me it’s not going to stop…” Long Shengtian felt a chill running through his heart. If he had to face the tribulation, he would be dead several thousand times over.

As lightning poured down from the heavens like rain upon the lands, the situation continued for several months before it finally stopped.

When the tribulation clouds finally scattered, Long Shengtian, Mo Zhi, and the others finally heaved a sigh of relief.

Inside the Cangqiong Dao Place, Huang Xiaolong circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to the extreme as he refined the grand dao energy contained in the seventh tribulation.

Since the time he had learned about the existence of the Huang Long Bloodline, he knew that he would experience tribulations like no other. However, he also managed to learn something from it.

The stronger the tribulation, the better it was for him! It was a way for him to refine himself even further, and become a stronger existence!

The scarier a tribulation, the purer the grand dao energy and grand dao laws contained within.

As such, he would be able to gain a whole lot more at a weaker cultivation level.

With his three saint godheads revolving at their maximum speed, Huang Xiaolong swallowed the grand dao laws and grand dao energy unceasingly.

The grand dao energy contained in the dao fruit also infused itself into his body.

Once again, the golden dragon phantom materialized behind him and a golden glow enveloped him.

…

“It has already been eighty years! Why hasn’t he emerged?” Long Shengtian paced nervously in the hall.

“There’s no need to panic. Young master is definitely refining the dao fruits after crossing the tribulation.” Long Jianfei was the calmest among those outside, and he tried to calm the others.

“Elder Ming took away the Tree of Grand Dao and the dao fruits in the mansion! He should be refining the fruits somewhere in the World Right right now!” Mo Zhi frowned. There was a trace of frustration in his heart when he brought up the topic.

In the past, he had put his life on the line in order to obtain the Tree of Grand Dao. He had used countless years to nurture the tree, but Elder Ming had snatched it away from him.

“It’s a real pity.” Long Jianfei sighed. “What a waste of resources.”

“Whatever. The Tree of Grand Dao was injured during the battle, and even if he refines all six dao fruits, he won’t be able to enter the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm.” Long Shengtian sneered.

He was still a little salty when the topic was brought up.

Even though Mo Zhi was the one who had obtained the Tree of Grand Dao, he was the one who had taken care of it in the Otherworldly Mansion!

“That old man is in the mid-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. If he refines everything he obtained, he might not be able to enter the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, but reaching the peak of the late-Sixth Resurrection shouldn’t be difficult.” Mo Zhi’s expression sank.

Everyone frowned when they heard his evaluation.

If Elder Ming really breaks through to the peak late-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, things might get ugly.

The space in the Otherworldly Mansion started to fluctuate all of a sudden.

A pillar of light formed from grand dao law pierced into the heavens, and it lit up the entire region.

Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, and the others quickly flew towards the pillar of light.

“This…?” Long Jianfei revealed a look of surprise. “Young Lord is about to emerge from seclusion!”

Everyone felt a burst of joy in their hearts. Huang Xiaolong had already turned into a pillar of their Otherworldly Mansion. With him around, there was no need to fear Elder Ming!

As a figure tore through the skies, Huang Xiaolong appeared before them.

“Young Lord!” Long Jianfei bowed respectfully as a smile lit up his face.

Long Shengtian and the others followed closely behind and they greeted Huang Xiaolong respectfully.

When Huang Xiaolong noticed Mo Zhi addressing him as the Mansion Master, he was slightly taken aback. However, Mo Zhi interrupted him before he could speak, “Xiaolong, you’re the only one fit to take on the position of the Mansion Master!”

Huang Xiaolong’s prestige and actual combat strength in the Otherworldly Mansion had long surpassed Mo Zhi. He had made up his mind to pass on the position of the Mansion Master when he had received news that Huang Xiaolong had chased Elder Ming away, and no one could change his mind. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong was his successor, and he would be able to rise to the position after defeating him anyway. Since Huang Xiaolong had defeated an enemy who had forced him to run away, there was no doubt that the little kid had already surpassed him when it came to combat prowess!

After hesitating for a short while, Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

“Young Lord, you already reached the peak of the late-Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm?!” Long Jianfei was stunned.

Mo Zhi and the others turned their attention to Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation level, and they were shocked when they discovered his progress.

“I was lucky enough to obtain the three dao fruits…,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Indeed. Without the dao fruits from the Sky Opening Island, he wouldn’t have been able to progress so quickly. However, his cultivation speed should also be attributed to the fact that he had devoured Yuan Qianxing’s Origin Saint Godhead!

“Young Lord, we managed to locate Yuan Wanfei and Elder Ming. Oh, we also have news on Fei Yanzi,” Long Jianfei seemed to recall something important, and he quickly made the report to Huang Xiaolong.

He knew that Huang Xiaolong would never agree to let his enemies run free!

“Oh?”

“The two of them are currently hiding in the Yin Borer Race!” Long Jianfei replied, and his expression turned extremely grave. The faces of the Primal Ancestors around changed when they heard the news.

“Oh?” Yin Borer Race? The strongest race in the World River?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback that they had managed to hide in the Yin Borer Race.

“Yes. Moreover, we received reports that Fei Yanzi managed to leave the Sky Opening Island unharmed. However, she disappeared when passing through the region controlled by the Yin Borer Race.” Long Jianfei continued, “They should be involved in her disappearance…”
