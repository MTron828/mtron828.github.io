Before long, Chen Qinghai, Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the others discovered the look of fear on Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu’s face.

What in the world was going on?!

Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang were shocked. A flash of suspicion passed through their eyes. They knew Huang Xiaolong’s identity and even though he had the King of Supreme Godhead, with Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu’s identity, there was no need for them to be afraid of him.

Huang Xiaolong was just a brat with a King of Supreme Godhead in the God King Realm!

He wasn’t an expert in the Emperor realm!

As their thoughts ran wild, Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu quickly made their way towards Huang Xiaolong’s party. With an apprehensive expression, a never seen before smile of subservience appeared on their face.

Under the gazes of Chen Qinghai and the others, Wang Shuchen cautiously greeted Huang Xiaolong’s group. “As it turns out, Brother Huang and esteemed senior are both drinking here...”

Wang Shuyu bowed slightly and a brilliant smile appeared on his face, “ I didn’t expect Brother Huang and esteemed senior to still be in the Floating Twilight Land.”

Brother Huang!

Esteemed Senior!

Hearing the way they addressed Huang Xiaolong and the little cow with brilliant smiles on their faces, everyone from the Devil Tiger City and the members of the Brightness Emperor Palace fell into a state of shock.

Who were Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu? Not only were the two of them hall masters who came from one of the top ten palaces, the Martial Demon Emperor Palace, they were also mid-level Emperor Realm experts!

With their status and strength, they had the power to command the wind and summon the rain as they wished. Right now, they addressed Huang Xiaolong as ‘Brother Huang’! Brother! They even addressed Jiang Hong as ‘esteemed senior’! Esteemed senior!

Too bad for them, Huang Xiaolong threw them a casual glance before turning to look at Chen Qinghai and the other members of the Brightness Emperor Palace. Ignoring the stunned look on their faces, he turned back to Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu, “What are the two of you planning to do? Do you want to drink with us?”

How could Huang Xiaolong not understand what was going on after seeing Tian Ziyi, Bai Yuxiang, and the people from Brightness Emperor Palace?

He had never expected that they would pursue the matter and come knocking at the door to look for trouble again. Now, they had even brought over Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu from the Martial Demon Emperor Palace!

Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu’s faces changed as they heard the underlying dissatisfaction in Huang Xiaolong’s voice. Wang Shuchen hurriedly waved his hand repeatedly and explained, “No, no, Brother Huang, please don’t misunderstand. We are merely passing by! I heard from my subordinates that the wine here isn’t too bad and we came all the way down to try some! We didn’t think that we would meet Brother Huang and esteemed senior here!”

Wang Shuchen smiled and stuttered, “Yeah! It’s such... such a coincidence to meet Brother Huang and esteemed senior here!”

The two of them were still suffering from hidden injuries they had sustained from Jiang Hong’s attack in the past. Back then, they had unleashed the ancient Concealing Shadows Law, but were still sent flying out of the void the moment Jiang Hong had pointed a single finger at them. The scene of them vomiting fresh blood was still fresh in their minds.

Even their Palace Master had suffered grievous wounds after a single pointed finger from Jiang Hong!

Chen Qinghai, Wu Chao, and the others who were standing at the side saw how their Hall Masters were explaining themselves as though they were afraid Huang Xiaolong would pin some random crime on their head, and their scalp started to go numb.

Wu Chao became dumbfounded but a wave of terror gripped his heart. He knew that Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong were definitely not ordinary people.

Jiang Hong looked at Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu with an indifferent gaze before turning his head towards the rest. “Did the people from the Brightness Emperor Palace send you here to avenge them?”

Avenge them?

Wang Shuchen, Wang Shuyu, and Chen Qinghai were startled.

The three of them immediately understood what was going on.

Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong definitely had some run in with the people from the Brightness Emperor Palace.

After understanding Wu Chao’s intentions, Wang Shuchen, Wang Shuyu and Chen Qinghai turned furious and glared at Wu Chao with murderous intent bursting out of their bodies. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Seeing the threatening gaze on him, Wu Chao’s heart nearly stopped beating. His legs turned into jelly. His legs buckled and he fell to his knees. He tried explaining himself as tears streamed down his face, “Hall Master, Master, this, I , I...”

It was too bad he didn’t know what he could say to explain himself.

How could he possibly tell them that he had followed the orders of Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang and had not done it on purpose?

With a wave of his sleeves, Wang Shuchen sent Wu Chao flying towards Huang Xiaolong. “Brother Huang, esteemed senior, this is the Mayor of our Devil Tiger City. He lied to us and reported to his master that someone had severely injured the disciples of our Martial Demon Emperor Palace and showed extreme disrespect. He also said that the offenders were experts at the Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm and we decided to come over to take a look.”

Wang Shuchen had never expected that Wu Chao would lie to them!

In fact, he believed that Wu Chao wouldn’t have the guts to deceive them!

Wang Shuyu sincerely explained, “That’s right, we didn’t know about this either. I beg Brother Huang and esteemed senior to find it in yourselves to forgive our wrongdoings... As for Wu Chao, you can deal with him however you want.”

Listening to Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu’s sincere explanation, Huang Xiaolong believed them. After the incident in Devil Python City, he knew that they wouldn’t rush over from the Martial Demon Emperor Palace just to deal with him.

“He is from your Martial Demon Emperor Palace. You can deal with him however you like.” Huang Xiaolong explained.

The two of them heaved a sigh of relief when they realized Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to blame them.

“Many thanks to Brother Huang for your magnanimity. Please rest assured... We will report this to the Palace Master and the Martial Demon Emperor Palace will punish Wu Chao according to the rules!”

They were going to report this to the Palace Master! The moment he heard that they were going to report his wrongdoings to the Palace Master, Wu Chao’s world flipped upside down and he passed out.

Seeing that Wu Chao was no longer conscious, Wang Shuchen ordered some men to bring him to the side to avoid bringing shame onto the Martial Demon Emperor Palace.

Now that they were done, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the other members of the Brightness Emperor Palace. He said coldly, “I never thought that you would be so persistent even after the lesson we taught you previously...”

The little cow smiled, “What’s wrong? Wasn’t rolling off the Heaven Eye Mountain Range enough humiliation for you? You guys want to roll again?””

Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu looked at the members from the Brightness Emperor Palace with strange gazes. As it turns out, they were sent rolling off the Heaven Eye Mountain Range... That explains a lot...

Tian Ziyi and the rest felt a rush of anger as they saw the judging gazes on Wang Shuyu and Wang Shuchen’s face.

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t think that you’re untouchable now that the Martial Demon Emperor Palace is afraid of you! Our Brightness Emperor Palace will never bow down to you!” Tian Ziyi raged.

“Really?” Huang Xiaolong asked with an icy voice.

The moment the words left his lips, Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel stood up.
