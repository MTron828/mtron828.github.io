Chapter 2884: Young Lady Yu Yue’s Arrival

The faces of Duan Feng and the others changed when they saw the overwhelming amount of sword qi. They didn’t expect his sword intent to be so strong!

If that was purely his sword intent, then how strong would he be if he used his dao souls and high-order Saint Fates?!

The only person who could remain calm was Huang Xiaolong.

In the distance, Yang Jia, Xu Xiaofeng, and the others who were looking at Huang Xiaolong frowned when they saw how calm he was acting.

“How can he act so casually when facing Yong Luosheng’s full sword intent? Heh, if he doesn’t die, he’ll definitely be seriously injured!”

“Let’s watch how he escapes from the chariot when it’s blown to pieces!” Xu Xiaofeng chuckled sinisterly when he thought of how Huang Xiaolong would be embarrassed in a second.

“Even Second Esteem Dao Venerables wouldn’t dare to take the attack head-on! The brat is basically asking for it!” Yang Jia growled coldly.

No matter who it was, they felt that Huang Xiaolong was looking down on them with the way he treated Yong Luosheng’s full-powered sword intent.

In the instant the sword river was about to slam into the chariot, Huang Xiaolong sent out a single punch. With a blinding blue light covering his fist, everyone felt as though their dao souls were frozen when they stared into it.

Even First Esteem Dao Venerables hiding in the void around them were no exceptions, much less cultivators at the level of Yang Jia and the others.

Their expressions changed drastically.

“This?!”

Before they could react, Huang Xiaolong’s punch landed on the never-ending sea of sword qi. The long-awaited explosion didn’t occur, and the earth that shook whenever two super attacks collided remained silent. Shockwaves didn’t spread like everyone expected.

The only sound that could be heard was a dull thud, as though someone had punched the earth.

Everyone could see the terrifying sea of sword qi freezing in the skies, and they turned into frozen icicles that formed a massive frozen river.

The sword qi that could sunder the heavens were frozen solid, just like that!

Along with blue light spreading through the skies, a sea of blue appeared before everyone.

The blue light didn’t stop as it appeared before Yong Luosheng in an instant.

With his expression changing, he raised his arm in panic.

Boom!

The heavens finally shook and everyone saw a figure tearing through the space as he shot towards one of the distant mountain ranges.

Crash!

Unable to stop the spreading blue light, it quickly approached the members of the Ten Swords Creed.

“?!”

Not a single person managed to withstand the blow as they were sent flying.

“What just happened?!” someone in the crowd screamed.

Looks of disbelief appeared on the faces of those present.

Yong Luosheng used everything he had comprehended in the way of the sword to unleash the strike, but he was sent flying with a single punch from Huang Xiaolong! The punch didn’t even hit him directly, and he was sent soaring through the skies like a dead dog!

That wasn’t all! The members of the Ten Swords Creed weren’t spared either!

All of them were like flies that were slapped out of the sky as they fell one by one.

“Absolute… Absolute frost!” someone’s trembling voice finally rang through the skies in an attempt to explain the power Huang Xiaolong wielded.

Yang Jia of the Blue Lotus Creed was the one who spoke, and he couldn’t believe his eyes!

That was the power of absolute frost!

Chaos erupted in the hearts of many when they heard what he said.

Previously, Huang Xiaolong had used the power of absolute frost and flame to destroy the grand dao physique of Yu Zhou, Chen Dingtian, and the others. However, that was something that they had heard through the rumors. None of them had seen it for themselves, and they refused to believe that as a Primal Ancestor, Huang Xiaolong had the ability to wield one of the absolute powers!

However, he had now displayed the power of absolute frost right before them and there was nothing they could do to deny its presence!

As the frozen sea in the skies started to dissipate, balls of blue mist swirled above the land. As the sunlight reflected off the droplets of blue mist, a breathtaking scene was painted.

“Weaker than a breeze…” Huang Xiaolong muttered when he stared at Yong Luosheng who was crawling to his feet.

His voice rang loud and clear in the minds of those present.

Even though they felt that he was being extremely annoying, not a single person dared to speak up.

Those who chided him in the past, felt their faces turning red.

Boom!

The mountain range where Yong Luosheng had landed was shattered with a loud blast after he crawled to his feet, and one could see that the armor on his body was frozen by icy blue qi.

With a disheveled look, he cleaned himself of the shattered pieces of armor, and he swept his gaze across the disciples of the Ten Swords Creed. Killing intent rose in his heart, and his vision turned red.

“You… You deserve to die!”

“Brat, you have successfully angered me!”

“Everyone around you… Will. Die! All of you will follow that little b*stard to the underworld!”

Yong Luosheng growled as anger overwhelmed him.

Huang Xiaolong casually glanced at him and muttered, “I told you… You’re nothing more than a slightly stronger ant in my eyes. You have one last chance to make your move. You had better summon your dao souls and Saint Fates… No, call out your bloodline and give it everything you got!”

Xu Xiaofeng’s expression sank when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “This brat really thinks that he has won because he took on the sword strike from Yong Luosheng… Isn’t it just sword intent? When Yong Luosheng calls out his dao souls, he won’t be able to jump about for much longer!”

A cold gaze flashed through Han Tong’s eyes, and he sneered, “I hope Yong Luosheng makes him suffer before killing him!”

Yong Luosheng glared at Huang Xiaolong and raged, “Great! Since you wish to see my dao souls, Saint Fates, and bloodline, I shall fulfill your wish!” Rays of blinding light emerged from his body all of a sudden.

Two dao souls flew into the skies and the world seemed to fall silent in an instant.

Monarch Yu Sacred Land seemed to contain nothing more than the two dao souls he had summoned, and a ferocious dragon roar could be heard in the skies as life force filled the lands.

“Twin dao souls! Yong Luosheng actually has two dao souls!”

“Dragon Emperor Dao Soul and the Myriad Creation Dao Soul!”

Everyone started to clarmor the moment the two dao souls appeared.

After all, the Dragon Emperor Dao Soul was ranked eighth and the Myriad Creation Dao Soul was ranked fifth!

There might have been people with two dao souls around the Divine Tuo Holy World, but those with two dao souls in the top ten ranks were rare!

Soon after, high-order Saint Fates started to fly out one after another as nine of them hovered in the air above the rest. Resplendent rays of light shone above everyone else.

“Nine high-order Saint Fates! He’s only second to Lord Huang Shuai and the other super talents!”

All of a sudden, a massive red dragon whose body was filled with flames appeared behind him. The fire that covered the body of the divine dragon seemed to contain the ability to incinerate everything in its path!

“Unparalleled Bloodline and the Yang Dragon Bloodline!” Yang Jia’s expression changed. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Unparalleled Bloodline was extremely rarely seen, but the Yang Dragon Bloodline was even stronger than that!

There were many, who were taken aback by Yong Luosheng’s sudden revelation.

“It’s no wonder Yong Luosheng is hailed as the leader of the ten swords! His talent is only second to the super genius of the Divine Tuo Holy World!” Xu Xiaofeng sighed.

All of a sudden, the cry of a phoenix broke everyone's train of thoughts. With a beauty on its back, the phoenix made its appearance.

“Young Lady Yu Yue!”

“Young Lady Yu Yue has arrived!”
