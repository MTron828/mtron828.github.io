Chapter 2331: Just Five Minutes?

There were a total of two thousand disciples in the mid-Third Order Venerable Realm and Seventh Order Venerable Realm among the prisoners. To be exact, there were 2,254 of them!

As the jade plaques were piled up in front of Huang Xiaolong, he scanned through each and every one of them. The details of their saint attributes were recorded clearly on each plaque and Huang Xiaolong was delighted he didn’t need to guess blindly.

With his overpowered soul strength, Huang Xiaolong scanned through all of them in the span of several seconds. The more he read, the more he realized that all of the prisoners the Holy Heavens had caught possessed at least two saint attributes! They either had a saint godhead and a saint bloodline, or they had a saint godhead with a saint physique!

The discovery surprised Huang Xiaolong greatly.

It went without saying that the effects of his evolution would be greatly enhanced with the strength of the prisoners he was about to devour.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong realized another shocking fact. Out of all the thousands of prisoners, all of them had saint attributes ranking in the top three hundred ranks!

There were even a few of them whose saint attributes ranked in the top hundred! When Huang Xiaolong noticed several prisoners whose saint attributes ranked in the top eighties, he became even more ecstatic.

Very soon, he finished browsing all the jade plaques and returned them to Elder Zhang Sijin. Without hesitation, he confidently declared that he wanted to challenge the disciple of the Devil Palace in the 31,213th arena.

“31,213?!” Zhang Sijin pondered for a moment before cautiously asking, “Are you certain you wish to challenge Zhou Yang?!”

Zhou Yang was a peak mid-Third Order Venerable. His complete dao saint godhead was the Soulslayer Saint godhead, ranked 269th, and his Saint physique was the Demon Mist Saint physique, ranked 272nd.

Even though Zhang Sijin had heard that Huang Xiaolong could evolve his saint attributes, Huang Xiaolong’s current saint attributes ranked in the nine hundreds!

In Zhang Sijin’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong’s combat strength was way beneath Zhou Yang! He was basically sending himself to the gates of hell if he were to pick such a strong opponent from the get go!

“That’s right, I wish to challenge Zhou Yang!” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Zhang Sijin hesitated for a moment and said, “Your Highness, Zhou Yang possesses the 269th ranked Soulslayer Saint Godhead and 272nd ranked Demon Mist Saint Physique. He’s also a peak mid-Third Order Venerable. He won’t be easy to defeat. Why don’t you challenge Chen Xiantong in the 31,621st arena?”

“Chen Xiantong is a mid-Third Order Venerable, and his Saint bloodline and Saint physique ranks in the two hundreds.”

Compared to Zhou Yang, Chen Xiantong’s combat power was significantly weaker.

From what Zhang Sijin knew, Huang Xiaolong would be pushing it if he wanted to challenge Chen Xiantong, but he advised nonetheless.

“There’s no need, I choose Zhou Yang.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. Retrieving a billion holy bills, Huang Xiaolong passed it over to Elder Zhang.

For a disciple of the Holy Heavens to challenge a prisoner in the Devil Cave, they had to pay a challenge fee of a billion holy bills and ten contribution points.

When they first joined the organization, all new disciples were given one hundred contribution points.

The points had their uses. For those in the Holy Heavens, contribution points were worth their weight in gold! They could use the contribution points to purchase rare items that couldn’t be found in the outside world from the organization.

Since Huang Xiaolong was already acknowledged as the disciple of the four Primal Ancestors, he was given a total of forty thousand contribution points after entering the Holy Heavens.

Just the day before, he had spoken to Wu Ge about using up ten thousand contribution points before the apprenticeship ceremony and Grand Hall Master Wu had already notified the various hall masters regarding his decision.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong was adamant about challenging Zhou Yang, Zhang Sijin had no choice but to agree.

However, he had reported Huang Xiaolong’s dangerous decisions to the higher-ups in case anything were to happen.

Before long, Zhang Sijin brought Huang Xiaolong over to the 31,213th arena.

When the disciples loitering around the streets saw Elder Zhang Sijin bringing Huang Xiaolong over to the arena, they quickly started speculating his identity. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Who is this kid? Even Elder Zhang Sijin has to treat him with so much respect!”

“Shh! He’s Lord Huang Xiaolong!” Some of them who had witnessed Huang Xiaolong’s terrifying examination results hushed those who were talking about him.

“What?! He’s the kid who comprehended all twelve sacred steles?! There’s even a rumor going on about his saint attributes.... I wonder if it’s true that his saint attributes can evolve!”

“There’s always a shred of truth behind the rumors... If no one is stepping out to stop them from circulating, it has to be true!”

“Hmm, but is he really going to challenge Zhou Yang?!”

The disciples around whispered among themselves as they were in a mixture of shock, doubt, envy, and jealousy.

In the midst of the chaotic discussions, Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air and landed on the 31,213th arena.

In the depths of the Holy Heavens, the four Primal Ancestors activated the Heavenly Lens and locked onto Huang Xiaolong.

“This kid is quite a rebellious one, isn’t he? He’s crazy enough to challenge the prisoners from the Devil Palace the moment he steps into our organization....” Tyrant Chu laughed.

“Doesn’t this resemble a certain somebody when he joined the Holy Heavens back then? You were even worse when you entered the organization!” Lord Long stared at Tyrant Chu and chuckled in amusement.

In an instant, Elder Crow and the Heavenly Master cracked up.

“It’s a little inappropriate for him to challenge Zhou Yang. Old Chu is right. He’s being reckless.” Elder Crow spoke up all of a sudden.

The Heavenly Master nodded in agreement, “True. However, it’s not a bad thing for him to suffer some setbacks to temper his spirit.”

At almost the same time, Li Chen, Xie Yao, and the various Holy Princes of the Holy Heavens received the news of Huang Xiaolong’s challenge.

“It seems like Huang Xiaolong is preparing for the apprenticeship ceremony by fighting against those in the Devil Cave....” Lin Yijia sneered.

Xie Yao snorted, “Even if he trains non-stop for a year, he won’t be able to improve by much! It won’t change the fact that he will be making a fool of himself during the apprenticeship ceremony!”

Chen Kaiping bobbed his head in agreement, “He’s too full of himself. Does he really think that he’s a match for Zhou Yang?!”

“Heh! I’ll bet that he won’t even last ten minutes!” Xie Yao snickered as he ordered his subordinate disciples to keep tabs on the battle.

A few minutes later.

The disciple who was in charge of gathering information rushed into the hall.

The moment Xie Yao noticed him, a grin appeared on his face. “Is it over already? That’s a little too quick.... It’s only been five minutes! It looks like I’ve overestimated him! Hahaha!”
