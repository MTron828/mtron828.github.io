When Huang Xiaolong emerged from the star, many other superpowers had joined the ranks of the Radiance Knight Corp.

With the help of Cang Mutian, the Reverence Moon Old Man, and his master, the King of Grandmist, experts from various worlds had poured into the Radiance World without signs of stopping.

The three of them were extremely influential figures, and they managed to gather tons of help. Looking at the rumored ancient sects and superpowers popping up one by one, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t contain his surprise.

Even though he was the King of Hell and controlled all three worlds in Hell, the three old men’s influence was much stronger than him. The weight his words held couldn’t even come close.

The thing that surprised him the most was the presence of the troops sent by the Silver Fox Commerce. They had sent over four hundred billion troops to assist the Radiance Knight Corp, and the president of the Silver Fox Commerce, Bei Lengyang, had arrived in person to back them up.

Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of warmth in his heart.

Of course, Bei Lengyang hadn’t come alone. Bei Xiaomei had accompanied him. When Huang Xiaolong saw her, his jaw dropped in shock.

“Uncle!” Bei Xiaomei jumped in joy and rushed towards him the moment she saw him. She didn’t care about everyone else as she jumped into his arms.

The Reverence Moon Old Man, Cang Mutian, the King of Grandmist, and the others stared at the two of them mischievously, and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but feel the blood rushing to his face.

The little cow roared with laughter when she looked at the scene before her, “Xiaolong, it looks like your father-in-law and little wifey are here to support you...”

A sense of embarrassment appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

In contrast to Huang Xiaolong’s subdued performance, Bei Xiaomei turned to the little cow and pouted, “Senior little cowie really knows how to make fun of people!”

The little cow stared at her with a look of helplessness and sighed, “Little lass, I told you to stop calling me that!”

Bei Lengyang turned to Bei Xiaomei and chided, “Xiaomei, you need to behave yourself in front of Senior Azure Cow!”

Bei Xiaomei hastily hid behind Huang Xiaolong and stuck her tongue out at her father,

Huang Xiaolong eventually took his seat in the middle of the hall to listen to the battle report. When he heard that many superpowers had sided with Dun Ei, a frown formed on his face.

“There are more than twenty ancient sects and families supporting Dun Ei.” The King of Grandmist summarized, “The Howling Moon Wolf Race sent the most men, and most of the ancient families who arrived from Hell came because of the Howling Moon Wolf Race’s persuasion.”

When Huang Xiaolong heard that the Howling Moon Wolf Race was the one to make a move, a frosty light flashed through his eyes.

He knew the reason they were supporting Dun Ei. In the past, he had killed the young master of the Howling Moon Wolf Race and several ancestors belonging to them.

It seemed as though the Howling Moon Wolf Race was hell-bent on going against him. They took the best chance they got to oppose him.

“Relax. With us old men, Dun Ei will never be able to escape from his miserable fate. We hold the upper hand whenever we fight!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

“Xiaolong, you broke through?!” The little cow exclaimed all of a sudden.

As soon as she said it, everyone realized that Huang Xiaolong had indeed broken through to the Third Order Emperor Realm.

Huang Xiaolong felt no need to hide his achievements from those in the hall, and he explained, “I refined the two chaos lightning pools in the Radiance Ancestor’s treasury. It’s just a tiny breakthrough...”

When they heard that Huang Xiaolong was dissatisfied with the speed of his improvement, the little cow snapped, “Little brat, can you learn how to appreciate your gains?! You managed to enter the Third Order Emperor Realm in less than a year! Look at all of us! How long has it been since we last broke through a minor realm?!”

The Reverence Moon Old Man sighed, “That’s right. When you arrive at our level of cultivation, you will realize the difficulty of breaking through. The origin energy suppresses us, and if we want to break through, we need to use origin treasures!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but stare at them in shock.

At the Sovereign Realm, one is suppressed by the origin energy itself! Wouldn’t it be insanely difficult to advance to the next realm?!

Huang Xiaolong eventually got over his shock as he started discussing other matters with the rest.

In the end, he spoke of his decision to leave the Radiance Divine City for a while.

“What?! Why are you leaving?” Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

According to all of them, they were at the critical point of the battle. The Radiance Knight Corp needed Huang Xiaolong’s leadership to charge into battle! There was no way they could allow Huang Xiaolong to leave!

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly and explained, “I need to return to the Divine World for a while.” He had thought about it a long time ago. Since the battle was stuck in a stalemate and they wouldn’t be able to take Dun Ei down in a short period of time, he wanted to see if he could enter the King of Darkness’ palace.

If the King of Darkness was still alive, he could assist Huang Xiaolong in the final battle against Dun Ei’s camp. With the help of the King of Darkness, he would be able to smash through Dun Ei’s line of defense. After all, the King of Darkness was an existence no weaker than Shi Ming!

Of course, Huang Xiaolong also wanted to pay a visit to the Nine Colored Divine Phoenix Palace. The Nine Colored Divine Phoenix should also be a Sovereign Realm expert.

Huang Xiaolong also wanted to make a trip to the Devil Abyss.

The number one treasure of the Divine World, the Ancient Heavenly Court, was located in the Devil Abyss depths. If he managed to obtain the Ancient Heavenly Court and the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s treasury, he would be able to increase his strength before the final battle!

“Return to the Divine World?!” The three old men stared at each other in silence.

“Xiaolong, why do you need to go back to the Divine World?” The little cow asked with a trace of suspicion in her voice.

“I need to make a trip to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.”

A lightbulb lit up in the little cow’s head. In the past, she had followed Huang Xiaolong around wherever he went. She knew what he wanted to do there.

“Since that is the case, I’ll go with you.” The little cow stood up and walked towards Huang Xiaolong.

Since she had already spoken, the three old men knew that Huang Xiaolong had something he needed to do there.

In the end, none of them continued to question him, and they agreed for him to leave.

When Bei Xiaomei heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted to leave for the Divine World, a look of reluctance appeared on her face. She pouted her lips and glared at Huang Xiaolong. The reason she had followed her father to the Radiance World was to look at Huang Xiaolong. She had to beg her father countless times before he was willing to bring her along. Right now, she hadn’t seen him for more than a day before he had decided to leave.

Since Huang Xiaolong didn’t have much to prepare, he left on the same day with the little cow.

The two of them left silently, and only the upper echelons of his camp knew that he was gone. After all, the lesser the people who knew that he was gone, the better. If the news of him returning to the Divine World spread, Shi Ming and the others would definitely kill their way over.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong and the little cow found a secluded place, the little cow gathered her strength to punch a hole in space leading to the Divine World.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow appeared in the space above the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

Looking at the space below them, the little cow exhaled a long breath. “That was too tiring! This old cow is exhausted!” In order to speed their journey up, the little cow had been punching tunnels after tunnels in space. She had used a lot of energy before bringing them both to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. She was flying at full speed with Huang Xiaolong in tow.

Despite her complaints, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “I’m pretty sure you’re more hungry than you are tired.” He took out a bottle of Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills and tossed it over to the little cow.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong had brought out several dozen bottles of Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills in order to reward the little cow.

As soon as she saw the bottle of pills, the little cow’s attitude changed 180 degrees. A look of greed flashed across her face, and she grabbed the bottle at the speed of light. The look of exhaustion was nowhere to be seen.
