Chapter 2177: Rushing to the 33 Heavenly Gates

“He will come looking for us?” One of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s generals sneered, “I don’t believe Huang Xiaolong would dare to come at us. Even if he defeated the Heavenly Terror Ruler and Heavenly Master, so what? If he dares to show up, His Majesty will squash him to death with one finger!”

The slightly flustered experts settled down as they thought of the Giant Kun Ruler.

“That’s right, Huang Xiaolong’s nothing but a far in front of His Majesty!” A general spat angrily.

The Giant Kun Prince raised his hand, and everyone quieted.

“Huang Xiaolong’s strength really exceeded our estimation,” The Giant Kun Prince went on, “But Huang Xiaolong could defeat the Heavenly Terror Ruler and Heavenly Master only because of the Heavenly Saint Country’s origin energy. If he leaves the Heavenly Saint Country, he will absolutely be no match against the Heavenly Terror Ruler!”

“We’ll return to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country!” The Giant Kun Prince said as he stood up, “The heaven beyond heavens space is about to open. We’ll return to make preparations!”

“As for Huang Xiaolong, he would definitely go when the space opens. We’ll join hands with the Heavenly Terror Ruler and completely eradicate that scourge Huang Xiaolong once and for all at that time!”

“Yes, Young Lord!”

......

Several days later.

While many rulers were still in shock from the news, the Heavenly Terror Ruler finally made it back to the Heavenly Terror Country, albeit in a sorry state.

He escaped all the way back to the Heavenly Terror Country without stopping to breathe for a second until the moment he crossed the boundary into the Heavenly Terror Country.

“Huang-Xiao-long!” Upon remembering how he was defeated and forced to flee by Huang Xiaolong like a dog, the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng could barely restrain the killing intent surging in his chest.

This time, not only he had failed to kill Huang Xiaolong, but the Heavenly Terror Country had lost countless experts as well. On top of that, he had even lost the Golden Pig Treasure, Unbreakable Divine Shield, Bone Spur of the Crow, and many other powerful artifacts.

Thinking of the Golden Pig Treasure, Unbreakable Divine Shield, and those treasures, along with the fact that he had turned into a laughing stock in the Heavens Path, Dong Cheng felt like vomiting three litres of blood.

“Huang Xiaolong, you dog, I swear I’m going to trample you to death, trample on you miserably before letting you die!”

“My name’s not Dong Cheng if I don’t trample you into the ground like dog shit.” Dong Cheng threw his head back and roared to the sky. His words echoed throughout the Heavenly Terror Country, sending the experts of Heavenly Terror Country shuddering in fear.

......

Regardless of how astounded and ludicrous others in the Heavens Path felt as they talked about the matter, Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged inside the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace, entirely enshrouded in a cocoon of radiance light.

Huang Xiaolong had already consumed the Pill of Radiance Origin.

As expected, the Pill of Radiance Origin truly befitted its low-grade, high-rank status as the Great Treasure Dragon Pill. After he swallowed the pill into his mouth, vigorous waves origin energy from the pill rushed to every corner of his body, repeatedly filling his body with energy.

Tiny bubbles of pure radiance energy flowed out from Huang Xiaolong’s pores, hovering around him, resembling a giant radiance volcano crater.

Soon, dazzling radiance spewed out from the entire Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace.

This phenomenon quickly alerted many Heavenly Saint Country’s experts. Rays of radiant lights soared to the sky from the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace, forming a dazzling sea of light. Not even the defensive formations around the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace could block the radiant rays.

Gradually, as the radiant light grew brighter, supreme gods of radiance emerged above the sea.

A comfortable feeling spread over the people below bathed under radiant rays. Their mind and soul felt clearer and brimming with robust vitality.

The days came and went.

The sea of radiance above the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace had expanded. By the time a year had passed, the sea of radiance had reached several hundred million miles radius.

On this day, all the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts felt the heavenly country’s space suddenly tremble as if it was struck by a great impact. Then, the brilliant radiance rays burst out from the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace.

The radiance was so bright, dazzling, and mesmerizing that all of them would never forget this sight for the rest of their lives. It was as if the radiant sight before them was deeply imprinted into their souls.

Accompanying this sudden burst of radiance were numerous dragons, thousands of archdevils eclipsing the sky, and golden Buddhas immobile as great mountains.

An overwhelming aura spread and enveloped everyone, and the pressure made it hard to breathe even for the Heavenly Saint Ruler.

“That is...?!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Boom!

Before the Heavenly Saint Ruler, Marshal Lan Shifan, Xumi Old Man, the little cow, and the others’ astonished gazes, a solid light pillar rose high into the sky. It easily pierced through the Heavenly Saint Country’s boundary barrier, and rose higher, stirring the void outside the Heavenly Saint Country.

A human silhouette slowly strode out from the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace. Even more bewildering was that there seemed to be numerous Buddhas and gods following behind him.

Hearts trembled in awe.

“Xiaolong!”

“Lord!”

This person was naturally Huang Xiaolong.

Joy rose the little cow, King of Grandmist, Heavenly Saint Ruler, and the others’ faces as they hurried forward.

Seeing everyone present, Huang Xiaolong converged his aura, and all the radiance, dragons, archdevils, and golden Buddhas in the sky vanished in an instant.

“Xiaolong, you’ve already...?” The King of Grandmist spoke first as he arrived by Huang Xiaolong’s side. One could hear the elation in his voice.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. He knew what his Master, the King of Grandmist, wanted to ask. In the cultivation seclusion this time, he had successfully stepped into high-level Sovereign Realm, advancing to the early Seventh Order Sovereign Realm!

After feeling the brimming and vigorous energy inside his body, Huang Xiaolong felt confident that in his current state, he could easily defeat the Heavenly Terror Ruler without borrowing the Heavenly Saint Country’s origin energy or using four divine fires.

Although the difference between a peak late-Sixth Order Sovereign and early Seventh Order Sovereign was of just one level, once one crossed over, the strength multiplied by several folds.

As they saw Huang Xiaolong nodding his head, everyone’s joy was even more obvious.

High-level Sovereign!

In the Heavens Path, only those who had stepped into high-level Sovereign were acknowledged as experts. Moreover, everyone knew that Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary high-level Sovereign expert. Before Huang Xiaolong had advanced to the Seventh Order Sovereign Realm, he was capable of defeating the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng. Now that Huang Xiaolong had advanced to the Seventh Order Sovereign Realm, how terrifying was his strength presently?

After talking about the usual, daily lives with the little cow, King of Grandmist, and the others, Huang Xiaolong asked the Heavenly Saint Ruler about the latest situation in the Heavens Path and news related to the Heavenly Terror Ruler.

According to the Heavenly Saint Ruler, the Heavenly Terror Ruler had escaped back to the Heavenly Terror Country, and had activated the Heavenly Terror Grand Formation. Huang Xiaolong snickered in disdain. So what if the Heavenly Terror Grand Formation is activated. It is nothing more than the matter of one punch to break it.

But now, he was in no hurry to kill the Heavenly Terror Ruler. It was more urgent to refine the Golden Pig Treasure, God Burying Coffin, and Unbreakable Divine Shield.

In the next several months, Huang Xiaolong spent his time refining the Golden Pig Treasure, God Burying Coffin, and Unbreakable Divine Shield.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong left seclusion once again to head to the Heavenly Terror Country to deal with the Heavenly Terror Ruler, the Heavenly Saint Ruler came to him and informed, "Lord, we have received news that the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions are beginning to weaken!"

“What?!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice slightly raised in surprise.

The 33 Heavens Gates’ restrictions are weakening. Doesn’t that mean...?!

The Heavenly Saint Ruler went on to report that the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, Nine Palace Heavenly Country, Heavenly Terror Country, Black Dragon Heavenly Country, and other heavenly countries’ experts had set off to the heaven beyond heavens space.

Huang Xiaolong immediately had the Heavenly Saint Ruler assemble the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts. He also had him pass the message to the Mighty God Ruler before rushing to the 33 Heavenly Gates themselves.

Heaven beyond heavens!

He needed to find the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool and obtain the Lightning Origin Divine Tree, as well as purple grandmist aura!
