Chapter 3510: I Saved Them

 

“Third Brother!” Chu Huaihua and Chu Huaihao yelled. They flew into a fit of rage when they heard Chu Huaixiong’s voice. They refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong had the guts to torture Chu Huaixiong!

“Huang Xiaolong, you will die a miserable death!” Chu Huaihua emphasized every single word, and killing intent burst out from his body as he walked towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong was impassive. “I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint you. In fact, I’ll continue living a great life, one that is much better than yours!” 

Huang Xiaolong started walking towards Chu Huaihua.

The little dragon followed closely behind, and he nodded his head happily when he looked at the brothers. “The two of them look really tasty…”

Huang Xiaolong was struck speechless by the little dragon’s words.

Chu Huaihua and Chu Huaihao reacted the same way.

“Hehe, little brat, do you know who you’re talking to?” Chu Huaihua roared with laughter. “Are you a homeless child Huang Xiaolong picked up from the Dragon’s Impasse? What a shame. You chose the wrong person to follow, and you’re going to die the moment you leave the Dragon’s Impasse!”

“I’ll tear your tendons out and let your blood out of your body a cup at a time! I’ll grind your soul to dust!”

Chu Huaihua’s voice rang in the little dragon’s ears.

“Hehehe, You can try… My mother once said that my scales are the toughest in the universe. Let’s see if you manage to tear it off my skin.” The little dragon giggled.

A frosty gaze flashed in Chu Huaihua’s eyes, and he appeared before Huang Xiaolong in an instant. He sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong while his other hand reached for the little dragon. 

Huang Xiaolong responded with a punch of his own.

As for the little brat, he shook its tail once. Surprisingly, he moved faster than Huang Xiaolong, and his tail landed on Chu Huaihua’s palm before Huang Xiaolong’s fist could strike.

Chu Huaihua’s arm was torn open like a sheet of paper the moment the little dragon’s tail landed.

He stared at his hand which was cut in half as Huang Xiaolong’s punch crashed into him.

A resounding blast rocked the skies, and Chu Huaihua was sent flying from the impact.

“Second Brother!” Chu Huaihao roared as he rushed over. Despite catching Chu Huaihao, he failed to steady himself as they were both sent soaring through the air.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned. He knew that he could stop Chu Huaihua, but Chu Huaihao was another matter altogether. Chu Huaihao was strong enough to withstand the impact if Huang Xiaolong struck him, but he was still sent flying when he came into contact with Chu Huaihua! It seemed as though the little dragon’s strength couldn’t be underestimated.

With a shake of his tail, the little dragon appeared before the two. He moved so quickly that no one managed to react in time.

They panicked when they saw the smile on the little dragon’s face.

With another swipe of his tail, the little dragon wasn’t about to let up on his attack. Chu Huaihua’s expression changed, and a giant knife appeared in mid-air before the little dragon’s tail could land on Chu Huaihua again.

The only person strong enough to make the move was Chu Huaihao, but his expression changed when his blade slammed into the little dragon’s tail.

A look of surprise flashed in his eyes, and he didn’t know how the little brat possessed such strength! Even a grand completion stage God of Creation like himself couldn’t resist a strike from the little guy.

When his blade came into contact with the little dragon’s tail, he felt as though he was trying to withstand the weight of half the universe!

It was as though the opponent he faced was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage!

Chu Huaihao wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Huang Xiaolong stared at the little guy with his jaws agape.

Even though they were traveling together for several years, Huang Xiaolong had no idea how strong the little dragon actually was. He knew that the little dragon was strong, but the sudden revelation shocked him.

The little dragon’s image in Huang Xiaolong’s mind reached a whole new level.

When Chu Huaihao was staring at the little dragon in shock, five powerful auras appeared around him and slammed into his back. Chu Huaihua was unable to dodge the strike, and he was caught up in the blast.

Chu Huaihao turned around and tried to cut through the auras with the blade in his hand. A heavenly river formed with blade light tore through space, and it desperately tried to block the five incoming attacks.

It was too bad he underestimated their combined might. The river of blade light was shattered in an instant, and he was forced to retreat.

As for Chu Huaihua, he spat out mouthfuls of blood.

Five figures appeared in the space above.

“You…” Chu Huaihao stared at them in fright. 

“You’re Old Ancestor Ao Guang of the Silver Dragon Race!” Chu Huaihao stared at Ao Guang and gasped in shock. When he saw the other middle-aged man beside Ao Guang, his expression changed again. “Ao Shenghai!”

Ao Shenghai was the old ancestor of the Hundred Spirit Dragon Race!

He might be at the grand completion stage, but his strength was comparable to Chu Huaihao!

The two of them had disappeared from the universe for a long time, and many people guessed that they met their fate in the Dragon’s Impasse. Now, they stood before him as though nothing had happened!

Could it be?!

He turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong explained, “I saved them all, and they agreed to serve me for a hundred million years.”

Chu Huaihua and Chu Huaihao felt their hearts thumping in fear.

He actually managed to save Ao Guang and Ao Shenghai!

Even though they only agreed to serve him for a hundred million years, that was no different from joining Huang Xiaolong’s side!

The two of them looked at Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and the little dragon who was chuckling at the side, and they felt a sense of despair covering their hearts. They weren’t the ones hunting Huang Xiaolong down! Huang Xiaolong’s party had been waiting for them!

“Big Brother, leave!” Chu Huaihua sent a voice transmission to Chu Huaihao.

“No! We’ll leave together!” Chu Huaihao replied after a short while.

“My injuries are severe, and I’ll only be a burden if you try to bring me with you! None of us will be able to escape if we try to run together! You have to get as far as you can, and you can avenge us in the future!” Chu Huaihua pleaded desperately.

An uncertain light flashed in Chu Huaihao’s eyes, and he thought about it.

“Do it!” Huang Xiaolong saw through their plan in an instant, and he quickly ordered them to take the duo down. Everyone moved in unison.

The little dragon roared happily and charged in front of Huang Xiaolong as they went straight for Chu Huaihua. With a flick of his tail, he sent Chu Huaihua flying. His tail could strengthen according to his will, and Chu Huaihua was sent flying as a miserable shriek left his lips.

Chu Huaihua wasn’t much stronger than Chu Huaixiong, to begin with, and he had 4.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy. With a single strike from the little dragon, he felt his body shattering into pieces.

Huang Xiaolong could only smile helplessly at the side when he saw the ruthless move of the little dragon. “As long as you keep his bloodline intact, you can do whatever you want to him!”

The three brothers possessed the Huang Long Bloodline, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to see their bloodlines damaged. To him, the Chu Brothers were as precious as several universe-level spiritual veins.
