The Blue Spirit Gate’s experts felt a strong fear in their hearts.

"What do you want?!" Zhang Yunbo was shaken and angered at the same time as he glared at Huang Xiaolong and the Xu Baisheng.

But, Huang Xiaolong and void devil beast Xu Baisheng didn’t bother to answer. However, the void devil beast Xu Baisheng continued attacking. With another tap of his claw, another stream of corrosive devil qi shot out and pierced through a Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elder’s forehead.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng continued tapping his claw in the air, and with every tap, a Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elder died.

The Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestors’ expressions grew increasingly sullen and ugly. They clenched their fists so hard that their fingers dug into their palms, and their eyes turned scarlet, but the four of them forcefully endured their anger.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng consecutively killed five Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elders before stopping.

The Blue Spirit Gate’s group suddenly realized that those five Grand Elders were the ones who had shouted the loudest for Huang Xiaolong’s group to leave their spatial rings and divine armors behind.

This discovery made the Blue Spirit Gate’s group even more fearful.

“Hand out all your spatial rings and divine armors, and then scram!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rumbled in their ears suddenly.

Blue Spirit Gate’s group was very angry due to this, and Zhang Yunbo and Jiang Dongyang’s faces had turned red.

Hand out all spatial rings!!

“You!” Zhang Yunbo’s temper flared and he glared ferociously at Huang Xiaolong.

“You have ten seconds to consider before I change my mind.” Huang Xiaolong added indifferently.

Ten seconds!

Gui Yi began counting down.

Ten, nine, eight...

Zhang Yunbo and Jiang Dongyang’s faces were distorted with indescribable fury.

Still, Zhang Yunbo, Jiang Dongyang, and the other two Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestors decided to hand out their spatial rings. Watching this, the remaining Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elders also handed out their spatial rings with extreme reluctance. All of them hurriedly took off their divine armors as well.

A while later, Feng Er looked at the miserable looking Blue Spirit Gate’s group as they were fleeing for their lives and said, “Manor Lord, why spare their lives?”

Feng Er knew that their current battle power could have easily annihilated the whole Blue Spirit Gate’s group. Or, Huang Xiaolong could have at least subjugated those people.

It was the little cow who answered her, “The Blue Spirit Gate’s backing is complex. And the repercussions of killing or subjugating them would have been far greater than dealing with the aftermath for allowing them to flee” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Blue Spirit Gate’s backing! Feng Er was stunned, but a moment later, she nodded in understanding and dropped the subject.

Since someone as knowledgeable as the little cow had mentioned that the Blue Spirit Gate’s backing was not simple, then, it surely wasn’t simple. The Manor Lord must have listened to the little cow’s advice, since he had spared them.

Huang Xiaolong watched the fleeing Blue Spirit Gate’s group, and a cold light glimmered in the depths of his eyes. He knew that Zhang Yunbo won’t forget this matter easily, and he had a strong feeling that they would meet again in the future.

He retrieved his gaze from the fleeing group to the pile of spatial rings. He opened them all at once, and instantly a burst of herbal fragrances, rich spiritual energy from spirit stones, and divine pills permeated the valley.

A smile finally swept away the coldness from Huang Xiaolong’s face as he looked at the countless spiritual herbs, spirit stones, and divine pills.

“How does it feel to rob high-level Ancestor God Realm masters? Thrilling, isn’t it?” The little cow smiled sheepishly, and added, “You’ll feel even more thrilling when you rob high-level God King Realm masters!”

The wealth accumulated inside a high-level God King Realm master’s spatial ring would even more startling.

Huang Xiaolong snorted, and asked sarcastically, “Is there something more thrilling than that?”

The little cow chuckled roguishly, “Of course, robbing the Heavenly Emperor!”

The rest was dazed by the matter-of-fact tone in her voice.

Huang Xiaolong rebuked, “Why don’t you go rob the whole Divine World instead?”

It was the little cow who was dazed this time. After a long pause, she mumbled under her breathe, “Rob the entire Divine World? Why didn’t I think of that?”

Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to talk with the little cow any further. He hovered towards the center of the valley and began collecting the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits.

They swept away the valley of all the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits. Huang Xiaolong’s group also found other kinds of precious herbs. All these spiritual herbs were the best materials for refining chaos spiritual pills.

Huang Xiaolong did not leave immediately after coming out of the valley. His group continued flying deeper inside the cave since it wasn’t easy to visit the ghost cave. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong decided to look around if there was any other good stuff.

...

Two months passed in the blink of an eye

Huang Xiaolong’s group had literally flipped the area upside down, while harvesting everything they could find.

This land was filled with treasures, and it didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong’s group to fill up their spatial rings.

In these two months, Huang Xiaolong’s strength had risen further under the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s constant tempering. On the other hand, even though the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell’s moon essence had been nourishing his soul, the progress was still too slow for Huang Xiaolong’s taste.

During this period of two months, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er, had been cultivating inside the Blue Spectre Spring river.

Huang Xiaolong could feel that his True Dragon Physique had become more flexible after soaking in the Blue Spectre Spring river, and his defense was even more shocking. Even though Huang Xiaolong had yet to reach the stage where he could condense the godly spectre eyes, he was now able to see more clearly.

Huang Xiaolong’s group left the ghost cave after two months.

When they flew out from the ghost cave, the Soulless Star’s desolate environment gave them a feeling like a generation had passed since they had entered the ghost cave.

Although Huang Xiaolong had found the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits, and had all the spiritual herbs from the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure, the spatial rings from the Blue Spirit Gate’s group and Sand Waves Sect Chief Liang Luwen, he was still lacking about four hundred kinds of spiritual herbs for refining the Brilliant Black Soul Divine Pill. Thus, Huang Xiaolong planned to search for them in other places in the Soulless Star.

As there were no urgent matters or troubles dragging their feet, their journey was smooth and relaxed. They were also able to cultivate as they searched.

In the blink of an eye, a year went by. Huang Xiaolong had managed to find most of the required spiritual herbs, except for a few.

As time passed, Huang Xiaolong’s mood soured, as he still wasn’t able to find the two remaining spiritual herbs. These two herbs were the Wishful Golden Flower and Black Flames Ganoderma. On top of that, he could not find any grandmist aura either. Therefore, at one point, he decided to leave the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. Instead he decided to try his luck in finding the remaining herbs at the surrounding world surfaces’ trading houses.

“Manor Lord, you want the Wishful Golden Flower and Black Flames Ganoderma?” After learning Huang Xiaolong was searching for these two herbs, the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elder Zheng Guowen asked, and went on, “In our Sand Waves Sect’s treasury, we have the Wishful Golden Flower...”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised and delighted at the same time, “The Sand Waves Sect’s treasury has the Wishful Golden Flower?”

During the period of one year, the group of Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders had been obedient. Although they had not truly submitted to Huang Xiaolong, at least, on the surface, he hadn’t found any fault with them.

Zhang Guowen respectfully replied, “Several hundred years ago, our Ancestor Zhang Ningbo had once obtained several stalks of Wishful Golden Flower that were placed inside the Sand Waves Sect’s treasury. They should still be there. However, only our Six Ancestors and the Sect Chief can open the Sand Waves Sect’s treasury.”

Huang Xiaolong asked, “Do you have any clues about the Black Flames Ganoderma’s whereabouts?”

Huang Xiaolong believed that it was not going to be an issue in opening the Sand Waves Sect’s treasury, if there were Wishful Golden Flowers inside of it.

“Some years back, I had seen the Black Flames Ganoderma at the Scarlet One World’s Bright Nirvana Trading House’s auction hall. I remembered clearly, that Black Flames Ganoderma was bought by the Blood Imperial Sect’s Young Lord.” Zheng Guowen answered.

Scarlet One World surface, the Blood Imperial Sect’s Young Lord! Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, in that case...

Hmm, it’s a good chance to make the Blood Imperial Sect pay some interest!

With the next destination decided, Huang Xiaolong’s group flew towards the outer periphery of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. Their first stop was going to be the Reverence World’s Sand Waves Sect’s headquarters for collecting the Wishful Golden Flowers.
