Chapter 3699 – Mo Kun’s Disappearance

“Kill you?” Mo Ren chuckled. “Do you think I’ll kill you?”

Wu Fu’s expression changed.

If Mo Ren didn’t kill them, their fate would be even worse than death!

…

One night passed.

Before dawn broke the next day, Huang Xiaolong left the palace for the mirror. When he arrived, the first ray of sunlight fell onto the lands.

Huang Xiaolong continued to comprehend the mysteries behind the mirror.

The same thing happened for the following days.

The Dragon Overlord and the rest were surprised to discover Huang Xiaolong’s behavior.

“Has our lord managed to comprehend something from the mirror?” The God of Death asked.

Shaking his head, the Dragon Overlord sighed, “I have no idea. However, not even Lord Devil managed to understand the mysteries behind the mirror! Can our lord actually discover something?”

“Yeah..” Zhu Chen muttered at the side.

Half a month passed in a flash.

One fine day, Huang Xiaolong stood before the mirror.

After such a long time, the images became pretty clear in his mind. Even so, there were several parts that still eluded him.

Moreover, he only managed to see ten thousand images in total.

He could feel that ten thousand was merely the start. By the time he comprehended the ten thousand images, he would be able to discover the other images.

The images separated and fused together in his mind.

Rays of light surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The images didn’t depict any special art or the mysteries of the universe. It wasn’t part of the grand dao laws. In fact, it surpassed everything Huang Xiaolong ever knew.

The more he looked at it, the stranger he felt. He could feel his dao souls transforming.

The three great worlds in his body also started to change.

After a month passed, Huang Xiaolong finally understood all ten thousand images.

They formed a perfect image in his mind.

All of a sudden, the overlords stood before Huang Xiaolong with a serious face.

“Lord, something happened. My big brother seems to have gone missing.” Mo Ren explained.

“What?!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

“Yes. He should have returned two days ago. However, I tried contacting him today and failed to get any response. I activated all the power under our command but no one managed to locate him.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

Mo Kun was an expert whose combat strength neared the 20 billion mark. There was no way he would disappear without any reason.

“What do you think?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Could the Universe First Race be behind this?!” The Dragon Overlord muttered.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He thought of the same thing. It seemed as though they were on the same page.

If his disappearance was related to the Universe First Race, things might get ugly.

“If that’s true, my big brother might be in serious trouble. Lords, please save him.” Mo Ren begged.

“Relax. I won’t allow this to happen under my watch. The most important thing right now is to look for the place where your big brother disappeared.” Huang Xiaolong promised.

“Many thanks! I will definitely look into the matter!” Mo Ren rejoiced when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong turned to the others and he ordered, “Pass down the order! Get everyone in the Unknown Space to take note of the Universe First Race!”

“Yes, Lord!”

A moment later, all four of them left Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard and he sank deep into his thoughts.

Could Mo Kun’s disappearance be related to the Golden Cymbals King?!

Since he destroyed the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation and fled in the battle against Huang Xiaolong, it was more than likely for him to head over to the Devil Land.

“Universe First Race…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. It seemed as though he had to break thought as quickly as possible.

He could feel that he was at the cusp of breaking through. The moment he comprehends all of the images, he would enter the peak of the grand completion stage.

The next day, Huang Xiaolong continued to look in the mirror.

It didn’t take long before a new image appeared.

The 10002nd image only appeared a long time after the first.

Huang Xiaolong only managed to see a hundred new images in one day.

Several days later, Mo Ren looked for Huang Xiaolong and reported Mo Kun’s whereabouts. According to the reports, Mo Kun didn’t leave the Devil Abyss!

?! Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flashed with a weird light. “Wouldn’t that mean that he disappeared more than a month ago?”

“Yes.”

Huang Xiaolong fell silent for a moment.

“Lord, should I get them to check again?” Mo Ren couldn’t help but ask again.

“There’s no need for that. I’ll personally head over to the Devil Abyss.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Joy filled Mo Ren’s heart. That was the best case scenario.

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong called the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, and Zhu Chen over. He told them his plan, but rejected their offer to follow him over. If Mo Kun really landed in the hands of the Golden Cymbals King, they wouldn’t be able to do a thing.

After leaving behind several instructions, Huang Xiaolong left for the Devil Abyss.

He could only choose to leave the Nameless Devil Mirror behind. He could use the time to comprehend the previous images to its fullest extent.

Sitting in the grand formation of the Universe Boat, he closed his eyes to comprehend the images he saw before.

Several days later, he arrived in the vicinity of the Devil Abyss and stored away his Universe Boat.

Looking at the endless darkness, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before jumping in.

Even though he knew that it was a trap by the Universe First Race, he had to do it.

Devil qi filled the air inside the Devil Abyss and they existed since the start of time. Extreme frost filled the qi and Dao Venerables would freeze to death the moment they entered. Only if one managed to comprehend the power of absolute frost would they barely be able to venture within.

Of course, the devil qi and frosty air was nothing to Huang Xiaolong.

Releasing his dao souls, he flew towards the depths of the Devil Abyss.

Countless devilish creatures filled the abyss, but Huang Xiaolong pushed them all away using the formless grand cosmos energy that revolved around his body.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
