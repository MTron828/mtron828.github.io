The disciple respectfully complied and left the great hall.

On the periphery of the Black Warrior Institute’s grounds, Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingy, Gudu Ye, and Zhu Chu saw that the disciple who went to report had returned, but there was no Wang Na, nor a Grand Elder who came out to welcome them. Seeing this, these distinguish Patriarchs were slightly frowning.

The disciple stood a few meters before the four Patriarchs, saying that the Black Warrior Institute Principal invites them to the great hall.

Of course, that disciple only mentioned the Institute Principal and not Institute Principal Wang Na. However, neither Jiang Wuhuang nor Wang Dingyi, Gudu Ye, or Zhu Chu noticed this small detail.

“Hehe, that biddy is putting on airs now. She knows we’re here, but not only did she not come out to welcome us, she didn’t even send a Grand Elder, or an Elder at the very least. Instead, she just sent a common disciple to inform us.” Wang Dingyi was upset.

Gudu Ye curled his lips in disdain, bearing a hint of envy, “She’s now the Black Warrior Institute Principal, greatly favored by the Great Lord, putting some airs in front of us is no surprise. However, Jiang Wuhuang, even though that biddy is your lover, she obviously doesn’t put you in her eyes. Hehe, looks like you’re losing your charm ah.”

Wang Dingyi and the others didn’t bother to conceal their laughter, causing Jiang Wuhuang’s face to stretch taut in annoyance, “Several Patriarchs need not be concerned about my charm.” Jiang Wuhuang flicked his sleeves and flew forward, leaving the rest behind. Watching him act this way, Gudu Ye and the rest decided against saying anything more.

Without another word, the disciple led Jiang Wuhuang’s group to the Black Warrior Great Hall.

On the way, with his back toward the others, Jiang Wuhuang’s expression was sullen. Even after knowing he was here, that Wang Na actually hadn’t come out to welcome him? Looks like he needed to ‘torture’ her good tonight.

They soon arrived at the Black Warrior Great Hall, entering behind the disciple.

Just as they stepped inside, all four of them spotted Huang Xiaolong almost immediately, as well as Feng Yang, Liu Yun, Qi Wen, and Chen Yang. For a second, Jiang Wuhuang’s group was nonplussed.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re not dead?!” Jiang Wuhuang’s face sank.

“What, are you disappointed that I didn’t die?”

Wang Dingyi snorted coldly, “I didn’t expect you to still be alive, and I cannot comprehend why the Great Lord would spare you.”

Spare Huang Xiaolong? Feng Yang, Liu Yun, and everyone else revealed an odd expression.

“Where’s Wang Na?” Jiang Wuhuang already took a glance around the great hall but did not see her. He did not miss the two human-shaped holes on the walls, perplexing him. Not to mention the seemingly weakened Eminent Elders and Grand Elders in the hall, who were behaving fidgety.

Wang Dingyi and Gudu Ye suddenly tensed noticing Wang Na’s absence.

“Where is your Institute Principal Wang Na?!” Wang Dingyi directed this question at Grand Elder He Zhiwu.

He Zhiwu flinched, looking terrified. His mouth opened and closed, but no actual word was spoken. At this point, without Huang Xiaolong’s permission, even if he were given ten thousand times more courage, he still wouldn’t dare to utter a word.

Watching this, an ominous feeling suddenly crept up Jiang Wuhuang’s heart.

“Huang Xiaolong, is it you? Did you detain Wang Na? Speak, is it you?!” Jiang Wuhuang snarled at Huang Xiaolong.

“Could it be that Wang Na didn’t come out to welcome us because you detained her?!” Wang Dingyi was glaring daggers at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, you’d do better to release Wang Na immediately! Even if you locked her up, you cannot stop us from forming an alliance with the Black Warrior Institute.”

Other possibilities did not cross Wang Dingyi or the other three people’s minds. More accurately, it never occurred to them that Huang Xiaolong had the guts to kill Wang Na. Imprisoning her was the best choice in their opinion.

After all, Wang Na was the current official Black Warrior Institute Principal, everyone in the Black Tortoise Galaxy knew about this.

In the Black Warrior Institute’s tens of thousands of years of history, never had there been anyone who dared to do so.

A harsh snicker of contempt sounded from Huang Xiaolong, “You guys want to see Wang Na that old witch so much? Don’t rush, you lot will get to see her very soon.”

Hearing this, Jiang Wuhuang’s group thought that Huang Xiaolong meant he would release her and they inwardly breathed in relief.

“Looks like you aren’t so stupid after all, you understand that it’s useless to lock her up.” Jiang Wuhuang went on, “In fact, with your talent and strength, as long as you’re willing to submit, our Great Lord will definitely place importance on you.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t resist shaking his head in laughter, “Looks like you lot misunderstood my words earlier. Let me reword it; since you lot are so anxious to meet Wang Na that old witch, I’ll send you all down to hell to see her.”

The four Patriarchs stiffened.

Jiang Wuhuang and the others were just about to roar in fury, but Huang Xiaolong’s right palm raised up and an overwhelming suction force erupted from it. To Jiang Wuhuang and the other three Patriarchs’ horror, they felt as if their limbs were pinned to the air, unable to move even as they flew toward Huang Xiaolong.

“W-what are you doing, Huang Xiaolong?!” Jiang Wuhuang’s pupils shrank in fear. Yet, he refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would dare to kill him.

“What am I doing? You’ll know in a bit.” Huang Xiaolong reassured.

As the four came to a stop in front of Huang Xiaolong, his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power surged, swallowing their blood essence and godforce. Despair filled their eyes sensing the condition of their bodies, their faces ashen.

“I forgot to tell you guys, your so-called Great Lord is already waiting for you all in hell.” Huang Xiaolong kindly informed.

The four Patriarchs’ stiffened again hearing that, disbelief written all over their faces.

Huang Xiaolong increased the devouring power of his Archdevil Supreme Godhead, accelerating the speed with which Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, Gudu Ye, and Zhu Chu’s blood essence and godforce were flowing into his body.

It didn’t take long for the four Patriarchs to turn in dried corpses, just like Wang Na. Still, with their eyes protruding out of their sockets in fear, they tumbled to the floor.

The group of Black Warrior Institute Grand Elders was quietly trembling, their faces drained of blood. Even the Eminent Elders were not an exception.

The scene in front of them was too appalling.

Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, Gudu Ye, and Zhu Chu died just like that in front of them, any one of these four people was an existence that could have a third of the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s forces shaking with a stamp of their foot. Their families had been sitting at the top of the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s power hierarchy for the last ten millennia.

Now, all four died right in front of their eyes! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Sucked dry!

At the same time, the several Eminent Elders were secretly rejoicing. Had they refused to sign the blood contract with Huang Xiaolong earlier, they would have most likely ended up like these four dried corpses on the floor.

With a casual wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong sent out a sliver of fire element godforce, cleanly burning away the remains of Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, Gudu Ye, and Zhu Chu.

...

In a secret space within a large world surface not far away from the Black Warrior Institute, the Gudu Family Ancestor, Gudu Batian, was in close seclusion when a message from the family’s Grand Elder came through the communication talisman and disturbed him. Feeling that it was strange, Gudu Batian took it out and read the message. Instantly, his face was filled with grief, fury, and sorrow; his emotions became chaotic, “Impossible, how can this be! Who killed my Ye’er—!”

When a Gudu Family Grand Elder noticed that Gudu Ye’s life slip had shattered, he immediately reported the matter to their Family Ancestor.

Gudu Batian disappeared in a flicker. With a Greater Space Teleportation, he had arrived at the great hall of the Gudu Family’s main residence.

By this time, all Grand Elders of the family had assembled in the hall, waiting for him.

“Have you found out who the murderer is?!” Gudu Batian roared at the group of Grand Elders.

“Ancestor, we haven’t found out yet. But we know the Patriarch was heading to the Black Warrior Institute together with the Jiang, Wang and Zhu Families’ Patriarchs to discuss an alliance with Institute Principal Wang Na.” One of the Grand Elders answered weakly.
