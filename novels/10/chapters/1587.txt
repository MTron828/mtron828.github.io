Huang Xiaolong and his companions arrived at the main gates of the palace and just before they could enter, they ran into a group of people. There was a group of Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples leading the way for a group of Brightness Emperor Palace’s elders.

The group of Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples was the same group Huang Xiaolong had run into in the Perfect Galaxy. Looking at the Brightness Emperor Palace’s members, he found them familiar as well. Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang were present, as well as those people who were thrown out by Elder Fu in the Silver Fox Chamber of Commerce.

Huang Xiaolong and friends felt a little shocked when they saw them.

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the familiar faces before him, they turned to look at him as well.

Both sides stopped in their tracks.

They were all acquaintances here!

Everyone’s face was filled with shock.

“Huang Xiaolong!”

Almost simultaneously, everyone from the Grandmist Emperor Palace and Brightness Emperor Palace yelled.

“Huang Xiaolong, what are you doing at Grandmist Emperor Palace?!” Tian Ziyi took a step forward and asked him in a cold voice.

They felt extremely puzzled. Could it be that Huang Xiaolong received an invitation from the Grandmist Emperor Palace as well?

“If all of you are here, why can’t we be here?” The little cow shook her tail as she stared at Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang as though they were idiots.

Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the elders erupted with anger.

If this dog-cow didn’t talk, nothing would have happened. The moment she did, their shameful past surfaced in their mind.

When they thought about how Huang Xiaolong had sealed their godforce and rolled them out of the Devil Tiger City naked, Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang’s eyes turned cold. If looks could kill, Huang Xiaolong would have died a thousand times over.

“Huang Xiaolong, I don’t think our Grandmist Emperor Palace invited you here.” At this time, one of the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciple took a step forward. He yelled at Huang Xiaolong angrily, “What are all of you doing here at our Grandmist Emperor Palace?!”

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent and said apathetically, “When did the Grandmist Emperor Palace ever make a rule to state that one had to receive an invitation before coming?”

The Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciple was dumbstruck and his face turned gloomy.

However, Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the rest of them were secretly delighted that Huang Xiaolong had showed up uninvited. Wouldn’t that mean that they would be able to take care of Huang Xiaolong without interference from the Grandmist Emperor Palace?

From the looks of things, Huang Xiaolong seemed to even have some enmity with the disciples from Grandmist Emperor Palace.

That was even better!

Now, they didn’t even need to make a move personally!

“Huang Xiaolong, it’s you!” Just then, a cold stern voice rang out. Everyone looked over and saw Grand Elder Wu Tianhe and a well-built black haired middle-aged man walking out from the inner palace. The other man had triangular-shaped eyes and he wore a robe with the Brightness Emperor Palace’s insignia on it. Behind him stood Sun Bin and another hall master, We Kefan.

Wu Tianhe, Sun Bin, and Wu Kefan could all be counted as old acquaintances.

But what piqued Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity the most was the black-haired middle-aged man with triangular-shaped eyes.

An expert in the Emperor Realm!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart dropped.

Wu Tianhe, Sun Bin, Wu Kefan, and the black-haired middle-aged man walked towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Grand Elder Wu Tianhe!”

“Ancestor Peng Xingfei!”

Both the disciples from the Grandmist Emperor Palace and the Brightness Emperor Palace greeted their elders. Huang Xiaolong was taken aback when he saw the people from the Brightness Emperor Palace greeting the black-haired middle-aged man as ‘Ancestor’.

Wu Tianhe walked towards Huang Xiaolong and looked at him with a comforting smile. There even seemed to be an expression of excitement on his face.

“Huang Xiaolong, never in my wildest imaginations would I have expected you to show up at the Grandmist Emperor Palace!” Wu Tianhe laughed loudly in Huang Xiaolong’s face, “Very good, now I don’t even have to send my men to look for you!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Peng Xingfei turned towards Wu Tianhe and asked with great interest, “What’s going on? Did Huang Xiaolong offend Grand Elder Wu?”

Wu Tianhe nodded as his gaze landed on the Earth Bear beside Huang Xiaolong. His eyes narrowed, “I’ll be honest with you Senior Peng, we discovered this Earth Bear in the Perfect Galaxy and were just about to capture it. Huang Xiaolong appeared and robbed it from us. He even injured us in the process!”

However, as he did not want to divulge too much information about the incident, he did not mention a single word about him sending the elders to kill Huang Xiaolong and the others.

“It’s actually an Earth Bear?!” Peng Xingfei, Sun Bin, Wu Kefan, Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the rest were shocked when they looked at the little bear beside Huang Xiaolong.

Instead of showing signs of fear, the Earth Bear flashed a harmless smile, revealing its perfectly white teeth.

Sun Bin chuckled, “It seems like that happened to you guys as well. He did the same thing to us. Not only did Huang Xiaolong snatch our low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins, he even brought harm to Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang. We are extremely familiar with his tyrannical ways.”

All of a sudden, a crafty light flashed through the Earth Bear’s eyes and it started to pout, “Old man, I think you are misleading everyone here. You were the ones who wanted to kill big brother to prevent him from leaking any news about me. All big brother did was to defend himself. Didn’t he allow you to return alive?”

Wu Tianhe and the disciples from Grandmist Emperor Palace flushed red with embarrassment as they were exposed.

Ancestor Peng Xingfei from Brightness Emperor Palace suddenly said, “Grand Elder Wu, since Huang Xiaolong snatched your Earth Bear away, shouldn’t we capture him before doing anything else?”

Wu Tianhe was stunned for a moment but he managed to snap back to attention, “Alright, but be careful of the beasts around Huang Xiaolong as they are quite strong. Let our hall masters make a move.”

Peng Xingfei smiled, “There’s no need to trouble your hall masters. Since you’ve met me, I will gladly help you settle them all.”

Wu Tianhe heard that and beamed with joy, “In that case, many thanks to Ancestor Peng.”

He knew that Peng Xingfei was an expert in the early-Fourth Order Emperor Realm.

Without saying anything, Peng Xingfei turned around and directly pressed his palms down towards Huang Xiaolong. The brilliance of a thousand suns bloomed on the ground in an instant.

“Great Brightness Palm, trap gods and bind buddha!”

The Brightness godforce coalesced into numerous Great Brightness Palms and the Great Brightness Formation was formed. Everyone in Huang Xiaolong’s party was covered in light.

Lei Budong snorted coldy and released all his grandeur before opening his palm. Divine lightning poured down from the sky.

“Almighty Divine Lightning, destroy them!”

Divine lightning formed into a whirlpool and with one swirl, the Great Brightness energy dissipated. In the next instant, the divine lightning arrived before Peng Xingfei.

Peng Xingfei was astounded and hurriedly pushed out with all his might.

“Angel Brightness Seal!”

An ancient seal formed by thousands of brightness angels appeared before everyone.
