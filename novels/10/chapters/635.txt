Yang Yi and Shi Xiaofei did, however, notice the excited expression on the Ascending Moon Old Man’s face as he rambled on incoherently to himself. The pair of Master-disciple was puzzled and confused, not understanding why the Ascending Moon Old Man would expose such excitement and feverish eyes while watching Huang Xiaolong.

If Huang Xiaolong was truly able to refine a sacred grade divine pellet, then the Ascending Moon Old Man was required to give him the Rising Tide Ascending Moon Divine Pellet’s formula. To the old man, this shouldn’t be something worth getting excited and thrilled about... right?

While Yang Yi and Shi Xiaofei were trying to disentangle their confusion, the immortal essence fire in Huang Xiaolong’s palms separated into nine fire dragons, weaving around the Hailstone Holy Cauldron in a specific rhythm.

“Nine Dragons Rising to the Heavens?!” Ascending Moon Old Man’s eyes sparkled as he continued to observe. Huang Xiaolong had given him quite a few surprises today.

The Nine Dragons Rising to the Heavens was another ancient Dragon Clan’s top grade pill refining technique, but it required the person to have a high level of control toward the flame, otherwise they would not be able to separate their flame into nine fire dragon, being even less able to control all nine fire dragons to refine the ingredients inside the cauldron.

In fact, many of the galaxy’s alchemists of the current times would find it difficult to perform this.

Both Yang Yi and Shi Xiaofei grew quiet as they watched the nine fire dragons circling up and down around the Hailstone Holy Cauldron, mesmerized by the scene. Though Yang Yi was a Highgod Realm master, her skills in alchemy could only be considered passable.

Alchemy was similar to cultivation in a way, for it was dependent on a person’s talent. Not every Highgod Realm master could be a top-level alchemist at the same time. Although Yang Yi herself wasn’t skilled in alchemy, she could see that Huang Xiaolong had achieved great control over his manipulation of fire. Whereas Shi Xiaofei was merely enjoying the scene, she had never seen anyone refine pills before, and definitely not someone that looked so good while doing it.

If Huang Xiaolong were to know what Shi Xiaofei was thinking, he would probably smile wryly. Although he could control the nine fire dragons to refine the ingredients inside the Hailstone Holy Cauldron, it was a taxing effort.

If he lost focus even for a brief second, the nine fire dragons might collide with each other, scorching all the hundreds of herb ingredients inside the cauldron, rendering them a waste.

The nine fire dragons circulated around the Hailstone Holy Cauldron for over an hour before a pleasing melodious sound rang from the inside of the cauldron. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“This is the sound prior to pill forming?!” Ascending Moon Old Man’s eyes shone brightly. Only medicinal pellets with a high degree of purity would emit such melodious sounds prior to pill condensation.

From inside the holy cauldron, the melodious sound grew increasingly louder, a clear sign that the pill refinement was close to success.

All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong’s hands that had been controlling the nine fire dragons stopped. Instead, they pushed forward as if generating waves through the air, sending vibrant waves of immortal essence fire to wash over the Hailstone Holy Cauldron.

“This is the Hundred Waves Overlapping Hands?!” Even Ascending Moon Old Man did not even realize his heart rate rose.

The Hundred Waves Overlapping Hands Technique was even more difficult than the previous Transfiguring Hand of the Dragon and Nine Dragons Rising to the Heavens. This technique required the person to transform his own flame into a hundred layer of waves, moreover, each wave linked to the subsequent wave. They were continuous and couldn’t be disconnected until one hundred layers were achieved, requiring an even higher sophistication in flame control than the Nine Dragons Rising to the Heavens.

After completing the Hundred Waves Overlapping Hands technique, Huang Xiaolong’s fingers formed a seal, using his immortal essence fire to form palm-sized talisman symbol that contained a pentagon diagram within.

“This is, the Fire Law Formation?!” The Ascending Moon Old Man’s heart experienced wave after waves of shock. Forming a Fire Law Formation using one’s own fire was harder than the Hundred Waves Overlapping Hands technique.

“Go!” Huang Xiaolong issued a short bellow, and the Fire Law Formation between his hands flew forward, entering the Hailstone Holy Cauldron. In the next second, a clear chime rang in the air.

As the cauldron cover opened, pills of shining golden colour flew out.

“These are Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets?!” This time, it was Yang Yi who exclaimed in astonishment. This Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pill was a legendary sacred grade divine pellet! And the reason why Yang Yi was able to recognize this sacred grade divine pellet was because she had consumed one in the past.

This Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellet, as its name implied, would be able to heal one’s wounds within an hour’s time, no matter how grave the injuries were,—fully heal. Even if it was a gravely wounded Highgod Realm master.

“Right, they are indeed the Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets, moreover, these are top grade pellets!” The Ascending Moon Old Man chimed in, a beaming smile on his face as he stared at Huang Xiaolong with sparkly eyes.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Hailstone Holy Cauldron and calmed his surging god battle qi before turning to face the Ascending Moon Old Man, saying, “Senior Ascending Moon, since this junior has successfully refined a sacred grade divine pellet, that Rising Rite Ascending Moon Divine Pellet formula, can you give it to this junior now?”

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s lips curled back as a booming laughter came from him for a long time to the extent where Huang Xiaolong, Yang Yi, and Shi Xiaofei thought the old man was going to renege on his word. The Ascending Moon Old Man then said to Huang Xiaolong: “Little brat, kneel and pay respect to Master!”

“Huh, what? Kneel and pay respect to Master?” All three people present almost stumbled, falling to the ground.

What did this have got to do what that?!

Regaining his composure, Huang Xiaolong looked strangely at the Ascending Moon Old Man. At this point, Huang Xiaolong inwardly suspected that this old man did not have a strange temperament, instead, he was totally mental!

Huang Xiaolong’s expression angered the old man, “Little brat, what kind of look is that in your eyes! Don’t you know what respecting Master and loving the young means? How can you use this kind of gaze to look at your Master?!”

Huang Xiaolong, Yang Yi, and Shi Xiaofei were sweating profusely in their hearts.

Now, it elevated straight to Master!

The Ascending Moon Old Man continued to work himself up, “Little brat, think about it, how many disciples of super forces and families have begged to enter our Thousand Worlds Sect but we refused, this is your fortuitous encounter! The universe’s biggest dog-shit luck! This is your great blessing! Do you realize it?!” Ascending Moon Old Man had an expression as blaming iron not turning into steel as he glared at Huang Xiaolong, fuming that Huang Xiaolong didn’t recognize a good thing placed in front of him. Yang Yi and Shi Xiaofei’s expressions turned even stranger watching the Ascending Moon Old Man.

Fortuitous encounter!

Dog-shit luck!

Great fortune!

Huang Xiaolong watched as the old man’s finger got increasingly close to his nose, a wry smile emerged in his heart.

At this point, the fuming Ascending Moon Old Man suddenly stopped, replaced with an amiable, sweet smiling face, “Brat, didn’t you want the Rising Tide Ascending Moon Divine Pellet’s formula? As long as you take apprenticeship under me, I’ll pass the Thousand Worlds Sect’s Chief position to you, wouldn’t that formula be yours then?”

Huang Xiaolong was stupefied, like this also works!?

The Ascending Moon Old Man continued to throw more alluring baits, “At that time, not only the Rising Tide Ascending Moon Divine Pellet’s formula, all the pill formulas that the Thousand Worlds Sect owns will belong to you. Do you know about the Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pill? This pill can increase the chances of peak half-step God Realm masters breaking into the God Realm by fifty percent!”

Increase by fifty percent!

Huang Xiaolong, Yang Yi, and Shi Xiaofei’s eyes were twinkling like the stars.

The Ascending Moon Old Man chuckled, “Only I can refine this Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pill, and only I have the pill formula. Of course, if you join my Thousand Worlds Sect, taking over the Chief position, this pill formula will also be yours!”

“Old monster, I’m sure you don’t know, Huang Xiaolong is the Black Warrior Institute Principal’s personal disciple.” Yang Yi interjected at this point.

The Ascending Moon Old Man froze for a second before looking at Huang Xiaolong again, “So, you’re Feng Yang that little kid’s personal disciple.”

Hearing the old man refer to his Master as ‘that little kid’, black lines shadowed Huang Xiaolong’s forehead. However, considering this old man’s seniority, he indeed qualified to call Feng Yang a little kid. Perhaps, in the entire Black Tortoise Galaxy, this Ascending Moon Old Man possessed the highest seniority, even those super forces and families’ Ancestors would have to lower themselves, using the term ‘junior’ to refer to themselves in front of him.
