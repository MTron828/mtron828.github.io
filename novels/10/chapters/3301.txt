Chapter 3302: Dismiss Him

Zhang Jiaying and the others were stunned when they saw the look on Murong Qing’s face.

“Principal!”

Ignoring all of them, Murong Qing rushed into the lift of the library. Seeing as the principal was in such a rush, everyone followed quickly behind. They saw Murong Qing’s shaky hands as he pressed the wrong level several times.

When they finally arrived on the sixth floor, Murong Qing turned to speak to Hu Yunqiang. “Please ask all the students here to leave. Remain here and wait for my command! No one is allowed to come up here without my permission!”

Murong Qing actually commanded the head librarian!

As soon as he spoke, the students who were still there quickly left the sixth floor. Not a single person dared to stay.

As for Zhang Jiaying and the others, they left as Murong Qing only allowed Hu Yunqiang to remain.

As Hu Yunqiang stood outside the elevator, he saw Murong Qing walking towards Huang Xiaolong cautiously as though he was afraid the sound of his footsteps would disturb the other party. A frowned formed on his face as question marks appeared in his mind.

He recalled how Murong Qing jumped in fright when he described Huang Xiaolong’s appearance earlier. He was even scolded badly by the principal. In Murong Qing’s words, he said, “Hu Yunqiang, do you know how badly you messed up?!”

That was the first time the head librarian saw Murong Qing raging.

However, he didn’t understand what he did as he only wanted to kick a troublemaker out of the library!

From Murong Qing’s actions, Hu Yunqiang started to guess the kid’s identity.

When Murong Qing arrived several meters away from Huang Xiaolong, a smile blossomed on his face as he asked in the softest voice possible, “Your Highness, are you here to read?”

“I’ll often come over to read. Please tell your head librarian and his staff to avoid disturbing me in the future.” Huang Xiaolong said as he glanced at Murong Qing.

With his mind spinning at top speed, Murong Qing realized that Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to pursue the matter and he heaved a sigh of relief. Along the way, he was so scared that his heart was about to leap out of his chest. He had already prepared himself for a scolding.

“Yes, yes, yes. Your Highness, please rest assured that I will definitely warn Hu Yunqiang!” Murong Qing’s smile couldn’t be wider as he addressed Huang Xiaolong.

“There’s no need to blow things up.” Huang Xiaolong added.

Noting Huang Xiaolong’s intentions, Murong Qing bowed respectfully. After ensuring that Huang Xiaolong didn’t have anything else for him, he left on his tiptoes.

When he returned to the elevator and saw Hu Yunqiang, his expression turned dark and he growled, “We’ll talk downstairs!”

The two of them left after he spoke.

When they returned to the first floor, Murong Qing lectured Hu Yunqiang before telling the others to avoid disturbing Huang Xiaolong. Moreover, he reminded them that the matters that happened were not to be told to anyone else. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Principal, he’s not here to read!” Zhang Jiaying pouted.

Furrowing his eyebrows, Murong Qing knew that she was the person who started it all. He wanted to strip her of her title that very instant, but he decided against it after thinking about her status.

“Zhang Jiaying, I know that you’re pretty proud of what you have achieved, but you need to know that you’re merely a frog in the well! There are a lot of things out there that you don’t understand, but it doesn’t mean they don’t exist!” Murong Qing warned her.

He knew that experts of the Enlightenment Realm and above would be able to develop a terrifying level of divine sense. They would be able to process information quickly, and he knew that Huang Xiaolong was using it to read his books.

Even though Murong Qing brought forth the subject as nicely as he could, he was obviously criticizing Zhang Jiaying’s intellect!

A frown formed on her face, but Murong Qing wasn’t the principal of the school for nothing. She decided to let it go as she didn’t wish to clash with him.

Only a long time after Murong Qing left did they start to speak.

“Who in the world is that young man?! Could he be the son of some high-ranking official in the Huaxia Alliance?” One of the librarians guessed. “Or could he be the young master of the great families?!”

“Let’s just leave.” Hu Yunqiang sighed. “All of you heard what the principal said. If anyone tries anything like this again, they will be fired immediately!” Even though he didn’t specifically address Zhang Jiaying, his words were no doubt a warning for her.

Soon after, Hu Yunqiang and the other librarians left.

The only person remaining in the library was Zhang Jiaying, and she stood there with a complicated expression on her face. Ever since she was born, she was pampered and sheltered by those around her. There were countless suitors surrounding her all the time, and her life was nothing short of smooth sailing. She only realized that the world didn’t revolve around her after Huang Xiaolong appeared.

For three whole days, Huang Xiaolong remained in the library.

Ordinarily, the library would close at eleven at night each day. However, after the person in charge of closing the library looked for Hu Yunqiang, he received instructions to not disturb Huang Xiaolong no matter what happened.

As Huang Xiaolong read the books at an exceptional pace, he completed nearly a fifth of the collection of books on the sixth floor in three short days.

When Lin Kai approached Huang Xiaolong three days later, a weird expression could be seen on his face.

The day before, he moved into Huang Xiaolong’s villa.

When he discovered that Huang Xiaolong had remained in the library for the past three days, he went to ask around and learned about the events that happened with Lu Fang and Zhang Jiaying.

Even though Murong Qing and the others suppressed the news, there were various students who managed to discover Huang Xiaolong’s identity. After learning that Huang Xiaolong was the deputy head of the school, they released the news to the entire school.

Of course, all of them were only able to learn that he was the deputy head of the school. They had no idea he was the grand elder of the prestigious Huang Family!

“Has school started?” Huang Xiaolong asked when he saw Lin Kai.

Hesitating for a moment, Lin Kai stuttered, “Uncle, did you… Did you throw Zhang Jiaying out of the library several days ago?”

“Yeah, what about it?”

“Zhang Jiaying is the granddaughter of Zhang Yuhan’s older brother!”

“Oh…” Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock. Wouldn’t that make her Zhang Yuhan’s grand niece? It seemed as though the world was really a small place.

“Has Zhang Yuhan returned to school?” Huang Xiaolong asked again.

Shaking his head, Lin Kai sighed, “No she hasn’t.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. He reminded Murong Qing to inform him when she returned, but it seemed as though that day had yet to arrive.

“Oh right. The kid you beat up the other day, Lu Fang, went to get his family to deal with you after learning that you became the deputy head of the school!” Lin Kai seemed to have thought of something and reminded Huang Xiaolong, “I’ve heard that he’s planning to use the Lu Family’s authority to dismiss you from your position! According to the various sources, the Lu Family’s presence in the Huaxia military is nothing to scoff at! Lu Fang has two uncles who are generals in the army!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted and completely glossed over the fact. So what if they were part of the military? Even if the entire world joined hands, he could roll over all of them with a single snort.

Lin Kai hesitated for a moment when he saw the expression of indifference on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Little brat, just spit it out. You don’t have to hide anything from me.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he noticed the look on Lin Kai’s face.

Scratching his head awkwardly, Lin Kai sighed, “There's something I need your help with…”
