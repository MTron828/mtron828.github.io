Chapter 3641 – My Grandfather is The Master of the Zhu Lan Lands!

Helpless, Cao Kezhang could only look towards Zhu Yun.

Zhu Yun sneered in contempt, “Cao Kezhang, you brought this upon yourself. Our young master decided not to pursue the previous matter, but your daughter hasn’t entered the Chen Family yet. Aren’t you messing with us internationally?”

Cao Kezhang revealed a bitter expression and he sighed, ‘Brother Zhu Yun, don’t you know that the old ancestor of the Chen Family is a God of Creation at the large completion stage?”

“Humph, a weakling like that isn’t worth a fart before my Zhu Family.”

“Yes… Yes…” Cao Kezhang muttered.

“There’s no need to worry. If the old ancestor of the Chen Family dares to take his rage out on you guys, let me know.” Zhu Jian muttered. “I’ll deal with it.”

Now that Zhu Jian had spoken, Cao Kezhang couldn’t say anything else. Everyone could tell that Zhu Jian was at the end of his patience. If they angered him, the Cao Family would be done for! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Naturally, Cao Kezhang knew that Zhu Jian was only stepping in to end the discussion. With his status, he wouldn’t bother with anything that happened after he left. The Cao Family would be left to deal with the Chen Family’s rage eventually.

Walking towards Cao Ying, Zhu Jian caressed her face and he chuckled, “Not too bad. She’s a little beauty indeed. If your performance in the following days pleases me, I’ll treat you well.”

Cao Ying gritted her teeth and tears of despair streamed down her face.

Everyone knew what Zhu Jian meant. Obviously, he didn’t expect her to bring him tea and wine in the following days. She would have to provide him with plenty of extra services on top of that!

Cao Kezhang and the experts of the Cao Family knew what was going to happen, but none of them dared to speak up!

“Take your hands off her right now!” A cold sneer rang through the skies.

Widening their eyes in shock, no one expected anyone to speak in that manner to Zhu Jian.

Turning around slowly, Zhu Jian glared at the person who spoke.

Cao Kezhang and the experts of the Cao Family were pleasantly surprised by the appearance of the newcomer.

“Ancestor!”

“Father, you returned from the Bewilderment Island!” Cao Kezhang yelled happily as he rushed over to Cao Dehong.

Other than Cao Dehong, there were five other people standing around him. They were Huang Xiaolong, Tao Hang, and the others!

“Grandpa!” Cao Ying cried as she ran over to Cao Dehong. After all, her grandfather had always doted on her.

Turning to face Cao Kezhang, Cao Dehong slapped him across the face. “You piece of sh*t, you embarrassed our entire family!”

They had long seen Cao Kezhang’s cowardly actions from afar. They only appeared when Zhu Jian took things too far.

After slapping Cao Kezhang, Cao Dehong hugged his granddaughter and sighed, “There’s no need to worry. Your father might not dare to stand up for you, but I will!”

Zhu Jian sneered in response, “Standing up for her? Old man, are you the ancestor of the Cao Family? How do you wish to deal with this?” A look of mockery could be seen in his eyes.

Even though he was surprised that Cao Dehong managed to return from the Bewilderment Island, he knew that Cao Dehong was a ‘mere’ God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. With the Zhu Family’s background, he wasn’t afraid of Cao Dehong in the slightest.

As such, he didn’t really care that Cao Dehong had returned.

Ignoring Huang Xiaolong and the others, he didn’t care how many people Cao Dehong came back with either.

Cao Dehong glanced at Huang Xiaolong subconsciously. Zhu Jian was Zhu Chen’s grandson, and he was also Mei Jie’s son! If Huang Xiaolong chose not to back him up, there was no way he could go against the entire Zhu Family.

Huang Xiaolong saw the look on Cao Dehong’s face, and he muttered softly, “Break whichever hand he used to touch her.”

“Yes, Lord.” With Huang Xiaolong’s affirmation, Cao Dehong was no longer worried about angering the Zhu Family! He turned to Zhu Jian and a cold light flashed in his eyes.

Zhu Jian roared with laughter when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “You motherf*cker, who do you think you are? Do you dare to say that again?”

Cao Dehong didn’t bother waiting for Zhu Jian to finish as he shattered Zhu Jian’s arm before Huang Xiaolong could reply.

As a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, one could only imagine the outcome when he wanted to teach the puny Zhu Jian a lesson. Miserable yells rang through the air.

Zhu Yun and the experts of the Zhu Family didn’t expect Cao Dehong to move so suddenly, and their expression changed instantly.

The experts of the Cao Family were similarly shocked.

“Cao Dehong, you…” Zhu Yun roared as killing intent filled the air.

The experts of the Zhu Family lunged at Cao Dehong in unison.

However, three figures appeared in front of Cao Dehong before the experts of the Zhu Family could arrive. The moment they attacked, the experts of the Zhu Family were sent flying.

They were the other three experts standing beside Huang Xiaolong, and all of them were at the peak of the grand completion stage.

Zhu Jian might be Mei Jie’s son, but there was no way he could bring that many experts around as bodyguards! Out of the dozens of experts who came with him, there was only a single one at the peak of the grand completion stage! There was no way they would ever be able to stop Huang Xiaolong’s group.

“You!” Zhu Yun glared at the three unexpected guests.

Dao Dehong casually tossed Zhu Jian into the ground below.

Rushing over as quickly as they could, Zhu Yun and the others helped him up.

“Young Master, are you alright?” Zhu Yun asked.

It would be a miracle if he was fine. With his arm broken by Cao Dehong and being flung into the ground after, he was in pretty bad shape.

When they helped him up, Zhu Jian couldn’t believe what happened to him. He refused to believe that everything that happened was real. Ever since he was born, everything had gone his way. No one would dare lay a finger on him, much less break his arm and throw him into the ground.

“How dare you!” Zhu Jian roared, “My grandfather is the master of the Zhu Lan Lands, and my father is the third strongest expert in the Zhu Lan Lands! How dare you touch me?”

Huang Xiaolong turned to Cao Dehong and sighed, “Break his other arm too.”

“You…” Before Zhu Jian could complete his sentence, Cao Dehong had already shattered his other arm. Zhu Jian’s screams tore through the air once again.

Zhu Jian roared, “Kill them all! Exterminate the Cao Family!”

Zhu Yun and the others hesitated for a second while looking at each other.

“Young Master, we… We should leave…” Zhu Yun whispered in Zhu Jian’s ear.

With killing intent leaking from his eyes, Zhu Jian glared at Zhu Yun, but he was met with a shake of the head from Zhu Yun. He suppressed the killing intent the best he could and growled, “Alright, we should leave…”

When they turned around, Zhu Jian glared at Huang Xiaolong with a look full of hatred.

“Lord, should we…” One of the Gods of Creation behind Huang Xiaolong muttered while drawing a line across his neck slowly.

“It’s fine.” Huang Xiaolong laughed, “It’s just a few ants.”

Cao Kezhang limped over to Cao Dehong slowly when he saw that the members of the Zhu Family had left. “Father, won’t the Zhu Family take revenge on our Cao Family now that…”

“There’s no need to worry. With our Lord here, no one can do anything to us. Hurry up and greet the Lord!” He pointed towards Huang Xiaolong.

Cao Kezhang and the others could only greet Huang Xiaolong respectfully after hearing what Cao Dehong said.
