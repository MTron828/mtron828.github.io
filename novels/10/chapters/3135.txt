Chapter 3136: Meeting the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed

Other than the Son of Destiny, Li Tianyao, there was a group of eminent elders from the Destiny Race. More than thirty of them arrived. Every single one present was a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable.

“I’ve heard that Lei Qianqian and Hao Zhen had entered the Origin Sea.” Li Tianyao muttered with strange runes flashing in his eyes. “The two of them are definitely here for the Flower of Time and the Void Reincarnation Thistle!”

“We have to move faster than them! We cannot allow them to obtain the treasures!”

The leader of the eminent elders, Li Shuo, nodded his head. “Young Master, you can rest assured that the Void Reincarnation Thistle will definitely end up in our hands! Unless the ten overlords show up personally, the treasure is ours!”

Li Tianyao nodded and he brought them into the Origin Sea.

In the blink of an eye, a month passed.

Huang Xiaolong and his group killed off god knew how many groups of genesis level beasts, and they avoided countless genesis level restrictions. They basically traveled through all the islands on the periphery of the Origin Sea.

It was late at night and Huang Xiaolong’s group decided to take a break on one of the uninhabited islands.

“Your Highness, it looks like the Son of Mystic isn’t on the outskirts of the Origin Sea…” Lei Yu sighed.

“We shall head deeper into the Origin Sea tomorrow!” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

As long as the Son of Mystic was in the Origin Sea, there was no way he could get away!

Soon after, they lit up a campfire and all fourteen of them sat around it. When Huang Xiaolong looked at the flickering flames, his thoughts started to wander.

In his past life, he was from Earth in the Pangu World. In this life, he grew up in the Huang Long World. He even thought about locating his father, the God of Creation, Huang Long.

Huang Xiaolong gained some insights from the memories of Di Shuang and the others about his father’s location.

“There’s someone there. Let’s take a look.” A lady’s voice entered the ears of those present.

It didn’t take long for a group of cultivators clad in dark robes to appear before Huang Xiaolong. The person in the lead was a woman, and she was extremely pretty. She might not be comparable to Lei Qianqian or Feng Yuxuan, but she was an absolute beauty. She emitted a pure and adorable vibe.

However, the thing that caught Huang Xiaolong’s attention was the insignia of the lightning dragon on their robes.

The lightning dragon wasn’t foreign to Huang Xiaolong. In fact, he was extremely familiar with it! That was the insignia of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor from the Divine Tuo Holy World!

Huang Xiaolong ran into the old ancestor a long time ago, and he learned about the power of darkness and lightning from the old dragon!

A chuckle left his lips. He didn’t expect that he would run into the members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed in the Origin Sea.

The only thing he couldn’t understand was why the old dragon went all the way into the Origin Lands to set up his creed.

Very quickly, the members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed arrived on the island.

“Fellow cultivators, we’re here without any ill intentions.” The pretty lady’s gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong and she cupped her fists in greeting. “I wonder if it’s convenient for us to ask you some questions?”

She could see that Huang Xiaolong was the leader of the group, and she spoke to him directly.

“You guys should be from the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed… I know your old ancestor.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The woman and the other experts of the dao convergence stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Someone like him knew their founder?

It was clear that they didn’t believe him. After all, the old ancestor had left the Origin Holy World several billion years ago.

Moreover, they couldn’t believe that a random person they ran into would know their old ancestor.

As the members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed looked at Huang Xiaolong’s group, they wondered if the fourteen cultivators before them had any ill intentions in mind.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother explaining himself when he saw their expression of doubt.

An awkward laugh left the lips of the pretty girl. “Fellow cultivator is really funny.”

“Ask what you wish to know.” Huang Xiaolong continued. He didn’t harp on the topic of the old dragon ancestor.

“We wish to inquire about the Silver Leaf and Golden Branch. We’ve heard that the treasures appeared in the Origin Sea previously. If you manage to provide us with any news of it, we are willing to hand over a huge sum of money! We will be eternally grateful to you!”

“Oh? Silver Leaf and Golden Branch?” Huang Xiaolong lowered his voice. “Is someone poisoned by some sort of incurable poison?”

The herb was a genesis level spiritual herb that had the ability to cure all sorts of poisons in the world. One could only imagine how precious a herb of that level was.

Even the largest auction houses of the Origin Holy World might not be able to bring out anything like it for sale.

After a short hesitation, the lady replied, “Truth be told, our patriarch has been inflicted by a special type of poison. We require the herb to cure him.”

“So that’s what it is…” Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Wait a moment. I’ll check.” In the past, Huang Xiaolong seemed to have seen something like it in the treasury of the Mystical Pavilion in the Ancient Era City. However, it was useless to him and he only bothered to take the most precious of treasures.

Contacting Yan Fei, Huang Xiaolong received a reply. There wasn’t just a single stalk of the herb in the treasury of the Mystery Pavilion’s Branch, there were two!

Huang Xiaolong turned to the group and asked, “I have a subordinate with several stalks of it. He’ll personally bring it over to your creed now. There’s no need for you to look for it in the Origin Sea any longer.” After all, herbs at that level were rarely seen. Even if they searched for an eternity, they might not be able to find any if they weren’t fated to.

A frown formed on the lady’s face when she heard his answer. “Many thanks to fellow cultivator. We shall take our leave now.” After she spoke, the members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed left. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed slightly. It was clear that they didn’t believe that he would give them a stalk of the herb willingly. Not to mention the fact that he would send someone to their creed with a treasure of that level. They were probably going to try their luck elsewhere.

However, Huang Xiaolong understood the way they thought. Even top-tier creeds might not have treasures at that level in stock! Why would they believe a random youngster who said that his subordinate would send the herb over to their creed? Moreover, that was their first meeting with each other…

The other party might not believe him, but Huang Xiaolong got Yan Fei to personally send the herb over anyway. After all, he owed the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor for guiding his cultivation in the past.
