Huang Xiaolong would be separated from Yao Chi once he set off to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

He had decided to spend the next ten years there, returning before the All-Islands Great War began.

Ten years!

During these ten years at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, Huang Xiaolong would strive to break through to Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm!

Though anyone would refute on the spot that attempting to break through from Seventh Order to Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm in a mere ten years was impossible and ludicrous, Huang Xiaolong was confident in himself.

He was certain that he could gain a spot within the top ten once he advanced to Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm.

Top ten!

To rise above a hundred thousand disciples from other islands, entering the top ten could be considered quite a feat.

Still, Huang Xiaolong was not arrogant enough to think he could obtain the first place even if he broke through. The geniuses of the Divine World were as numerous as the stars in the sky, but most of all, his cultivation time was simply too short compared to others. Moreover, there were sure to be Ancient God Realm masters amongst the participating genius disciples. There might even be freaks who had reached late-First Order, even peak late-First Order Ancient God Realm.

These monstrous geniuses were likely to have outstanding battle prowess as well. A late-First Order Ancient God Realm disciple could have strength rivaling a Second Order Ancient God Realm disciple, thus, Huang Xiaolong had no confidence he could snatch the first place even if he advanced to early Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm.

Unknowingly, half a year went by.

During this half a year, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation rose steadily as he absorbed the spiritual energy from a grade five spiritual vein every night. Currently, he was very close to advancing to mid-Seventh Order.

He also gave Yao Chi one of the grade five spiritual veins, and with Xiaoniū’s help, her strength increased by leaps and bounds in this half a year.

Not long ago, Yao Chi had broken through to Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm.

As for the Barbarian God Sect, due to the Giant Tribe’s attack, the sect’s grand defense formation had been broken, resulting in the death of a large number of disciples, and its overall strength dwindled by half. Huang Xiaolong contributed countless divine pellets, ten-million-year-old herbs, and a couple of grade four spiritual veins, finally stabilizing the Barbarian God Sect’s situation.

Apart from that, Huang Xiaolong had ordered the Barbarian God Sect, Great Whale Sect, Elephant Genesis Sect, and the Giant Tribe to press the matter down, hence, the forces outside did not know that Ju Wufei’s death was related to him, completely ignorant of the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts, Xie Du, and Xie Tu’s existence.

The outside world merely knew that the three sects had allied with the Giant Tribe.

As for who was the head of the alliance, they could only guess.

...

Under the boundless night sky littered with sparkling stars, at the Barbarian God Sect back mountain, Huang Xiaolong and Yao Chi sat next to each other.

In front of them was the sea.

The water surface reflected the silvery moonlight, adding serenity to the night.

Neither of them spoke. Huang Xiaolong held Yao Chi’s right hand, which was similar to Shi Xiaofei and Li Lu’s hand, soft and smooth.

As the scent of the person sitting beside him teases his nostrils, Huang Xiaolong felt a heat gather at his navel.

As if knowing the reason for Huang Xiaolong’s physical discomfort, Yao Chi’s cheeks blushed red, slightly hot, even her breathing grew heavier. She then moved her lips close to Huang Xiaolong’s ear, whispering, “You still haven’t found all the herbs.”

Yao Chi’s hot breath tickled Huang Xiaolong’s ears, but her words doused him like an icy rain, extinguishing the heat wrecking havoc inside his body.

A bitter smile rose to his face, looks like he had to restrain himself for a while longer. Although he had the Barbarian God Sect, Great Whale Sect, Elephant Genesis Sect, the Giant Tribe, Golden Dragon Gate, and Berserk Lion Sect searching for the materials to refine the Reverse Incarnation Pill for Yao Chi during this period, they still lacked a few.

Among the five essential chaos spiritual herbs, other than the Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus, there was no news of the other four.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s expression suddenly turn solemn, Yao Chi giggled softly before pressed her lips against his cheek. “Alright, don’t pull a face.” Her tone changed saying, “Lu Zhuo said that the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield is filled with danger at every corner, and even an Ancient God Realm master could lose their life just loitering on the mainlands and planets at the edge. Must you go there?”

Yesterday, Huang Xiaolong told Yao Chi that he would depart to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield in a few days.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “I must go.” His tone determined.

The adversities he experienced until this point had honed his determination in his cultivation path.

The Grandmist Parasite Medium; if he could successfully cultivate this technique and reach the fourth stage, it would enhance his cultivation speed to a horrifying degree. However, in order to successfully cultivate it, he had to find grandmist aura.

Knowing there might be grandmist aura in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, this was a trip Huang Xiaolong had to make.

Seeing the determination on his face, Yao Chi understood that it was futile to persuade him further, nothing she could say would change Huang Xiaolong’s decision, which made her silently sigh in her heart.

“Don’t worry, I still have the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts with me. As long as I don’t venture too far in, there shouldn’t be any problem as long as I’m in only staying on the edge of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.” Huang Xiaolong turned his head slightly, reassuring Yao Chi. “Your cultivation should keep up, when I returned to participate in the All-Islands Great War, you’re coming with me to the Fortune Mainland!”

Yao Chi nodded obediently, “I will. Although my talent is far from Xiaofei and Li Lu, these two younger sisters, I will cultivate diligently and strive to break through to the Ancient God Realm.” Her hand tightened around Huang Xiaolong’s hand as if reassuring him.

While Huang Xiaolong decided to leave for the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, on the Soul Islands at a corner of the Endless Sea, the Soul Tribe’s Young Lord Hun Dishan was roaring at a group of Elders, “A useless bunch! You lot can’t even find a person, get out and continue to search!”

The group of Soul Tribe Elders quivered as they swiftly left.

Watching the quivering group of Elders, Hun Dishan felt even more irritated. He bellowed, causing the sound wave to sweep over the hall and pulverize all the furniture.

Some time ago when his treasury key was stolen, four Nether Spirit Beads went missing from the Soul Tribe treasury. Not only that but also twelve Ancient God Realm godheads and an entire hill of fifty-million-year-old herbs!

Because of this matter, his father, the Soul Tribe Patriarch, locked him in the dungeon, where he suffered the pain of being roasted by the geocentric flames for a whole year! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If it wasn’t for his outstanding talent, as well as his contributions to the Soul Tribe all these years, which made his father value him, he would have been put to death on the spot.

Hun Dishan’s killing intent soared thinking of that punk who stole his treasury key and the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beast corpses.

“Punk, one day I’ll find you and torture you until you wish for death!” Hun Dishan screamed.

A long time later, his emotions finally calmed down.

“Looks like I have to go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield again.” Hun Dishan muttered under his breath. There was some progress in his experiment with the corpse controlling technique, therefore he wanted to make another trip to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield to try his luck and see if he could find a few corpses of ancient divine beasts, or better yet, Ancient God Realm divine beast corpses.

“Young Lord, the Patriarch wants to see you.” A Soul Tribe deacon walked into the hall and relayed the message.
