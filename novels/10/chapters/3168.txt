Chapter 3169: One of Deer Spring Holy Land’s Super Families

Prosperous Peace City’s number one family!

Huang Peng’s group tensed, looking even more solemn.

The Chen Family’s old ancestor is a peak half-True Saint? Is that the realm above Venerable Sovereign?!

To them, the Venerable Sovereign Realm was already the realm they could only dream of, but the Chen Family’s old ancestor had transcended the Venerable Sovereign Realm!

Although they did not know how big the Deer Spring Holy Land was, since the Chen Family was one of the hegemons of Deer Spring Holy Lands, it spoke volumes of their power. This was not someone they could provoke at this stage. Even guards beside a core disciple were Venerable Sovereign experts, and the Chen Family could easily kill them a hundred times and more simply by sending a few Venerable Sovereign experts.

Smugness crept up Chen Xu’s face when he saw Huang Peng, Shi Xiaofei, and the others nervous expressions, and he directed his words at the group of ladies, “All of you follow me into the restaurant, there is a generous reward waiting if you serve me well, otherwise, hehe, I would punish you, have you strip naked and throw you into the streets!”

Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, Bei Xiaomei, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao were incensed.

“Insolent!” Many of the Thirty-three Heavens’ rulers were enraged.

“Insolent?” Chen Xu sneered as he raised one hand and slapped across space. The several Thirty-three Heavens’ rules exploded to their deaths, pieces of flesh and bones splattered all over the place, creating a hair-raising scene.

Huang Peng and the others were startled, Chen Xu was also a Venerable Sovereign expert!

“Do it!” Chen Xu ordered his guards as he waved his arm forward.

……

Far, far away from the Deer Spring Holy Land, in the vast space, Huang Xiaolong, Lin Xiaoying, Fei Yanzi, Feng Yue, and Yin Yue were having a good time traveling around in the Purple Lightning Peak.

“Xiaolong, your father and mother, how are they like? Also, would Elder Sister Xiaofei and other sisters dislike us?” Such questions suddenly popped out of Lin Xiaoying’s cherry lips.

In recent days, the four ladies had been asking quite a lot about Huang Xiaolong’s family as well as Shi Xiaofei and other ladies.

Despite having described and explained to them many times, they would still ask, rendering Huang Xiaolong speechless.

Looking at the apprehensive Lin Xiaoying, Huang Xiaolong smiled reassuringly and said, “My father and mother are easy to get along with. Xiaofei’s personality has always been very good. Relax, they will like you all.”

As Huang Xiaolong spoke, his three dao souls spread out, covering the various sacred lands in the four directions.

When Huang Xiaolong had ascended to the holy world in the past, he had arrived at the Zhuoyuan Holy Lands, hence, while traveling around Cangqiong Holy World, Huang Xiaolong would always go to places near Zhuoyuan Holy Lands and spread his dao souls senses out to check the surroundings. According to his estimation, his family would appear in these nearby areas when they ascended.

Huang Xiaolong was checking the surroundings out of habit, but when his three dao souls spread out, his face blanked for a second before joy rushed up. He was excited, thrilled even laughing out loud.

Lin Xiaoying, Fei Yanzi, and the other two ladies were bewildered by Huang Xiaolong’s abrupt excitement and sonorous laughter.

“Xiaolong?” Fei Yanzi called out.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked over his shoulder and excitedly informed the four ladies, “It’s father, mother, and the others. They have ascended. Xiaofei, and the others are with them as well!”

“What?!” The four ladies were astonished and excited at the same time.

All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong’s face turned frosty with killing intent. “D*mn these people!”

“Xiaolong, what’s going on?”

The four ladies were baffled.

“We’re heading there now!” Huang Xiaolong didn’t have the time to explain. The power of space surged as he brought along the four ladies and traversed through space, leaping over one holy land after another, and reaching the Deer Spring Holy Land in the blink of an eye.

Under Chen Xu’s command, the several Chen Family’s guards leaped towards the Huang Family’s group.

The Huang Family’s group was inevitably flustered, and although all of them were Sovereign Realm experts, they were lambs waiting to be slaughtered if they went up against the Chen Family’s guards!

They were excited, ecstatic, and filled with hope after successfully arriving in the holy world, but who’d have thought something like this would happen! Especially Shi Xiaofei and the other ladies, they had come to this stage holding onto the belief that they would soon be reunited with Huang Xiaolong, yet…

A split second before the fight broke out, all the Chen Family’s guards suddenly exploded to their deaths, leaving blood mist in the air as it scattered on the ground.

Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohao, the little cow, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and the others stood blankly on the spot.

What’s going on?! Not only the Huang Family’s group were dumbfounded, but Chen Xu, and the two guards behind him were stupefied by this sight as well.

Whilst everyone had yet to react, bright lights flickered as several figures appeared in front of them. When these people turned, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others trembled, and their red-rimmed eyes filled with excitement and disbelief.

“Big Brother!”

“Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaohai and the little cow cried out in joy as they rushed towards Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong embraced his younger brother Huang Xiaohai, laughing heartily.

Huang Peng, Su Yan, Old Man Grandmist, Bei Lengyang, and others were overjoyed, and hurried to Huang Xiaolong’s side.

“Father, Mother, Master!” Huang Xiaolong greeted them one by one. He could barely conceal the joy on his face.

“Good, good!” Huang Peng, Su Yan, and Old Man Grandmist were just as ecstatic.

The despair from moments ago had been blown away, replaced by a joyous atmosphere.

Chen Xu’s expression was darker than murky water, he glared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong. “Punk, you’re the one who killed my guards?”

Huang Xiaolong ignored Chen Xu, and walked towards Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and Yao Chi’s side. He spread out his arms and wrapped it around them. It felt as though he was reuniting with them after separating for a lifetime.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong ignore him and go to embrace the women he had just taken fancy to, Chen Xu was furious. “Punk, you’re courting death!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Before Chen Xu could finish his words, Huang Xiaolong casually pointed a finger towards his back and Chen Xu turned into blood mist silently, frightening everyone.

Huang Peng approached and said, “Xiaolong, he seems to be a core disciple of some Chen Family, and the restaurant staff said the Chen Family is this Prosperous Peace City’s most powerful family, one of the Deer Spring Holy Land’s hegemons. Their old ancestor is a peak half-True Saint!” There was heavy worry in his voice.

“Yes ah, Xiaolong, we better leave this Deer Spring Holy Land as fast as possible,” Shi Xiaofei persuaded with concern.

Lin Xiaoying, Fei Yanzi, Feng Yue, and Yin Yue watched on strangely.

Half-True Saint? One of Deer Spring Holy Land’s hegemons?

The two remaining Chen Family’s Venerable Sovereign experts sneered, “Our Cheng Family’s power reaches every corner of the Deer Spring Holy Land, where can you run to? Young Master Chen is our Patriarch’s nephew, you all only have one ending, die!”
