Chapter 3743: From Under Which Rock Did He Crawl Out?

The calmness on Huang Xiaolong’s face remained as it was. “Then, do you know who are you talking to?”

The Treasure Sage Human Emperor was taken aback as he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s fearless attitude, and his nonchalant tone. He sounded a little surprised as he asked, “Who are you then?”

“Huang Xiaolong,” Huang Xiaolong stated his name.

Huang Xiaolong?

The Treasure Sage Human Emperor and the surrounding experts were slightly dumbfounded.

One of the family’s old ancestors laughed abruptly, “Here I was thinking this brat is some world-shaking big shot!” He then joked with the experts close to him, “Huang Xiaolong? Have you guys heard of him?”

Those around him shook their heads.

“Never heard of him!” Another family’s old ancestor snickered, “Probably crawled out from under a rock somewhere!”

More joined in the laughter.

Even Old Granny Void and the other four couldn’t resist raising the corners of their mouths.

“Master, please allow this disciple to send this person packing so as not to disturb the master anymore.” At this time, a clear voice of a female disciple inside the Treasure Saint Palace traveled out. Obviously, she was one of the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s female disciples.

“Alright,” the Treasure Sage Human Emperor agreed with a nod of his head.

Right at this time, the auspicious rays from the river intensified a notch, and the vigorous flowing currents split in the middle as a giant golden cauldron soared out from the river.

“It’s the guardian treasure, Nine Cauldrons!” A voice cut across the air.

The various families’ and ancient races’ old ancestors immediately became spirited, searching the air with burning gazes.

Although the present families’ and ancient races’ patriarchs revealed their desires, no one dared to make a move, including Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and others. The five people looked towards the Treasure Saint Palace.

Seeing that the Nine Cauldrons had emerged from the river, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor couldn’t be bothered with Huang Xiaolong anymore. His palm reached out to grab the golden cauldron but there was someone faster than him. The suction force from Huang Xiaolong’s palm latched onto the Nine Cauldrons and pulled it back towards him. As it flew towards Huang Xiaolong, the Nine Cauldrons shrunk in size, being suppressed by Huang Xiaolong’s three worlds’ cosmos energy.

This action completely stunned everyone present.

“Preposterous!”

“Courting death!”

The Treasure Sage Human was furious that a brat dared to compete with him for the Nine Cauldrons, and his palms struck towards Huang Xiaolong across space. A mountain-sized palm imprint appeared and slapped down on Huang Xiaolong.

As a supreme expert breaking the 28.2 billion mark, one could imagine the force of the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack in a fury. Watching the palm imprint falling down on Huang Xiaolong, Old Granny Void and the others backed away in panic, afraid they would be implicated by the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the palm imprint that was falling down on him, but he was clearly unperturbed. He raised his hand that went straight through and unimpeded the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s palm force!

The Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s palm force brushed against Huang Xiaolong’s palm like a gentle breeze.

Then, everyone saw Huang Xiaolong easily pulling a person out of the Treasure Saint Palace and flinging him down on the Big River Mountain.

The Big River Mountain rumbled and quaked, and cracks began to run across the indomitable Big River Mountain that had been standing since ancient times. Cracks large and small started from the mountain peak and spread in all directions.

But the crowd’s attention was not on the Big River Mountain. Instead, all gazes were fixed on the person that Huang Xiaolong dug out from the Treasure Saint Palace and flung onto the Big River Mountain!

The person who Huang Xiaolong threw onto the Big River Mountain was someone clad in golden-purple brocade robe embroidered with a majestic dragon. There was an imperial and unique treasure qi around the middle-aged man.

“Treasure Sage Human Emperor!” Old Granny Void shrieked in astonishment.

The middle-aged man pulled out by Huang Xiaolong from the Treasure Saint Palace was none other than the Treasure Sage Human Emperor himself!

Those who had never seen the Treasure Sage Human Emperor ashened when they heard Old Granny Void’s high-pitched shriek.

That person thrown onto the Big River Mountain peak, looking disheveled and covered in dust, is the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?!

Looking at Huang Xiaolong again, the various families’ and ancient races’ old ancestors’ hearts gave birth to fear. It wasEspecially the few that mocked Huang Xiaolong and said he crawled out from under a rock earlier, looking pale as a ghost.

Almost at the same time, several figures flew out from the Treasure Saint Palace in a hurry.

“Master!”

“Your Majesty!”

For a moment, the Treasure Saint Palace’s experts were running around like headless flies, unsure of what to do.

The Treasure Sage Human Emperor raised his hand, signaling the Treasure Saint Palace’s experts not to come over as he got up from the ground. Dazzling lights rippled over him, as he shook off the dust and dirt off him.

Under the crowd’s attention, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s robe fluttered without wind, and a golden light gleamed in his pupils. His unique treasure qi soared to the sky and ten thousand precious pearls appeared around him.

It was a myriad of pearls.

There were the primordial dragon pearl, Eye of Qilin, and Heart of the Golden Phoenix amongst these pearls, exuding an overwhelming coercive aura.

The Treasure Sage Human Emperor was called the Treasure Saint because he had a habit of collecting all kinds of treasures, and his main preference was collecting all kinds of precious and powerful pearls in the world. He then proceeded to forge these pearls into an unfathomable grand formation consisting of ten thousand pearls!

Some claimed this pearl formation was stronger than any guardian treasures.

However, only a few people had actually seen the Treasure Sage Human Emperor using this set of pearl formations, because there were even fewer people that could make the Treasure Sage Human Emperor resort to using it.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s body slowly rose into the air, and the thousands of pearls around him rose with him, flying in circles around him and glowing in various colors.

“I very rarely use this set of pearl formation,” the Treasure Sage Human Emperor said with a deadpan expression as he looked straight at Huang Xiaolong. “Ever since it was successfully refined, I have only used it twice, and today is the third time!”

His original plan was to get the Nine Cauldrons to reforge this set of pearl formations to increase its power to another degree.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the glowing pearls around him, and stated placidly, “You only have one chance to attack!”

Every single of these pearls contained amazing power, and it was even more so after being forged into one grand formation. But in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, it was nothing more than a decoration, and it was even worse than his collection of universe treasures.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong say that he only had one chance to attack, Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s face distorted for a split second. He had never been so insulted, and even the top of the ten Human Emperors, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, had never underestimated him like this.

Treasure Sage Human Emperor spurred the cosmos energy of his world, and glaring lights burst out from the pearls around him as he activated the formation.

Glaring rays convened in midair and shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong merely raised his hand and waved gently to disperse the beam of light coming at him. At the same time, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor appeared above Huang Xiaolong and directed the pearl formation to slam down.

These pearls contained layers of formation inscribed personally by the Treasure Sage Human Emperor. They slammed down at full force, and the immediate space warped from pressure. The land under Huang Xiaolong’s feet was reduced to dust, turning into a bottomless abyss.

But Huang Xiaolong didn’t spare a look at these pearls, and directly punched upwards, sending all the pearls flying. The pearls scattered and crashed in different directions, reducing mountains to rubble, and more than a few people spotted cracks on these pearls!

After releasing one punch, Huang Xiaolong took a step forward and came face-to-face with the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.

Treasure Sage Human Emperor was shocked but reacted swiftly, punching out with both his fists.
