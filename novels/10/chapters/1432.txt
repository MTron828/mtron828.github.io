The Barbarian God Sect’s Ancestor and Sect Chief?!

Buzzing noises shook Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu’s minds.

This...!

The two people in front of them were actually the Barbarian God Sect’s Ancestor and Sect Chief!

To the three of them, the Barbarian God Sect’s Ancestor and Sect Chief were superior personas, yet they were referring to Huang Xiaolong as their Young Lord!

“This is Tie Family Fort’s Fort Lord Tie Qianyuan from Chen Country, and this is Tie Family Fort’s Young Fort Lord Tie Mu, and Young Miss Tie Xinlan. They are my old friends.” Huang Xiaolong introduced the three of them to Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling.

Hearing they were Huang Xiaolong’s ‘old friends,’ Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling warmly greeted Tie Qianyuan and the siblings.

“Hello, Fort Lord Tie, I am Lu Zhuo. Welcome!”

“I am Gu Ling, welcome Tie Family Fort’s Young Fort Lord and Young Miss!”

Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu were flustered receiving Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s warm reception. Their flustered excitement made Huang Xiaolong laugh.

“Alright now, let’s go in first.” Huang Xiaolong said to Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling, seeing that the three of them were unable to react for almost half a day.

“Right, right, right, go in and talk.” Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling both quickly invited Huang Xiaolong and the rest into the Barbarian God Sect’s great hall.

Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, Tie Mu, Lu Zhuo, Gu Ling and the others followed behind Huang Xiaolong and stepped into the Barbarian God Sect’s great hall.

Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu felt like they were in a dream as they looked at the magnificent Barbarian God Sect’s great hall. Tie Mu secretly pinched himself to see if he was actually dreaming.

The Barbarian God Sect’s higher echelons each took their seats upon entering the great hall. Huang Xiaolong began his customary questions, asking Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling about the Barbarian God Sect’s situation in recent years.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling respectfully answered each question.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong asked about the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect’s situations as well.

Tie Qianyuan and his two children stood on the side. The more they heard, the more astonished they felt.

The Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect were also under his ‘management?!’

The Barbarian God Sect, Elephant Genesis Sect, and Great Whale Sect... the Green Cloud Island’s three giants were all managed by Huang Xiaolong, doesn’t that mean...?!

The overlord of Green Cloud Island!

In the next moment, the three heard Huang Xiaolong ask about the Dralion Island’s Golden Dragon Gate and Berserk Lion Sect’s situations, once again they were shocked to hear this. Then, they heard Huang Xiaolong asked Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling about the Giant Tribe as well as the Nefarious Devil Tribe...

Waves after waves of shock struck the Tie Family’s heart.

Huang Xiaolong was at the Barbarian God Sect for half a day. After dealing with the several sects’ affairs, and making arrangements for Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu, Huang Xiaolong and his group departed from the Green Cloud Island without any further delay to return to the Fortune Gate.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong was back in the Fortune Divine Kingdom and met with his Masters, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

As Huang Xiaolong was not concealing his current cultivation in front of them, their jaws dropped when they saw Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation realm.

Peak late-Sixth Order Ancestor God Realm!

This was Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation realm.

On the journey back from the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, not only Huang Xiaolong had completely refined the ten pieces of high-level God King’s Buddha Pastes, but he had also refined close to a million top-grade chaos spirit pills!

As early as half a year back, Huang Xiaolong had already broken through to the peak late-Sixth Order Ancestor God Realm, but depressingly, he had been unable to break through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm through this half a year’s time.

The Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm was a ceiling that had been harder to break than Huang Xiaolong had expected.

“Master, is Li Lu at the Brimming Snow Palace?” Huang Xiaolong spoke first, as his Masters were still standing and looking at him in a daze.

“...Li Lu, oh, Li Lu, she’s around.” Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor mumbled as they recovered their senses.

“No, not there.” But both immediately refuted their earlier answers.

Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless. So, which was it? There or not there?

“Some days ago, she went to the Perpetual Peak.” Golden Brow Ancestor added.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected that. The Perpetual Peak? Isn’t that Li Chaosheng’s cultivation palace? No, wait—! Yao Chi is also at the Perpetual Peak, could Li Lu...?!

A strange expression rose to Huang Xiaolong’s face at the thought of that.

Blood Knife Ancestor was gloating at Huang Xiaolong’s expression. “When are you going to marry Li Lu and Yao Chi ah? We two want to drink some wine at your wedding banquet.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly.

“Oh right, Zhu Feng has already left Vientiane World. Not long after you set off to the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, he went to the Fortune Gate’s headquarters to register for the assessment.” Golden Brow Ancestor interjected.

“Zhu Feng’s already gone to the Fortune Gate’s headquarters?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised.

Blood Knife Ancestor nodded, “Yes,since the Fortune Gate’s headquarters is recruiting genius disciples with emperor rank godhead, Zhu Feng is qualified for the assessment, so he went. Zhu Yi spent a huge amount of spirit stones to have the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s people escort Zhu Feng until the headquarters. On top of that, news came two months ago that Zhu Feng successfully passed the assessment, and now, he’s officially a Fortune Gate headquarters’ disciple.”

“Moreover, there’s an Elder who likes him and has accepted him as a disciple in name.” Golden Brow Ancestor went on, “When you go over to the Fortune Gate headquarters, watch out for him.”

“Yes, Master, I understand.” Huang Xiaolong nodded, but didn’t really put the matter to heart.

A mere Zhu Feng couldn’t raise any waves.

“Alright now, you can head to the Perpetual Peak. Li Lu still needs your God King’s Buddha Pellet to suppress the evil spirit in her body.” Golden Brow Ancestor rushed Huang Xiaolong away.

Huang Xiaolong took his leave from his Masters and exited the Fortune Divine Kingdom, flying straight to the Perpetual Peak.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were comforted and proud of their disciple, as they watched his flying figure in the distance.

“That kid’s a freak to the core. At the rate he’s progressing, he’s going to surpass me in one or two hundred years!” Blood Knife Ancestor grumbled.

Golden Brow Ancestor laughed loudly, “It would be interesting if the kid asks to spar with you then.”

Blood Knife Ancestor felt even more depressed.

...

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong descended in Yao Chi’s courtyard on the Perpetual Peak.

Huang Xiaolong’s feet had barely touched the ground, when he saw Yao Chi and Li Lu walk out to the yard arm in arm. He was amazed at their ‘good-sisters’ closeness.

“Xiaolong!” Yao Chi exclaimed in delight as the two women discovered Huang Xiaolong’s presence. Yao Chi rushed straight to Huang Xiaolong, and even though Li Lu was more composed, her steps also quickened towards him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yao Chi ran into Huang Xiaolong’s embrace, but she suddenly remembered Li Lu’s presence and her cheeks turned red. She took a step out of Huang Xiaolong’s embrace, and said shyly, “You’re back.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and responded, “I’m back.”

Yao Chi smiled. “Younger Sister Li Lu and I have been waiting a long time for you.”

Younger Sister Li Lu? Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow and looked towards Li Lu.

Yao Chi giggled softly. “Younger Sister Li Lu and I are sisters now.” Then she added mischievously, “If you dare to bully me, I will tell Younger Sister Li Lu about it.”

Li Lu nodded her head seriously.

A drop of invisible sweat trickled down Huang Xiaolong’s cold forehead. He had actually been planning to ‘bully’ Yao Chi a little, but now his plans had been washed down the drain even before he had a chance to act on it.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Yao Chi smiled alluringly at him, “I’m sleeping with Younger Sister Li Lu tonight.”

Coldness enshrouded Huang Xiaolong’s heart and his lower body...
