Chapter 2764: My Subordinate’s Minion

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong, Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng, Chen Qi, and Yang Shangchen, all five of them, appeared at the venue the Spirit Devil Patriarch had set.

The residence was built stylishly, using the best materials.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the residence and sighed, “It’s a pity about this residence…”

This residence would be reduced to dust when the fight would break out later.

“Cangqiong Old Man is finally here, we’ve been waiting for you, ah.”

Huang Xiaolong’s group heard laughter just as they appeared at the residence’s entrance. The doors opened, and the Spirit Devil Patriarch as well as a group of experts walked out.

However, the Spirit Devil Patriarch’s laughter somehow sounded gloomy and insidious in Huang Xiaolong’s group’s opinion.

Huang Xiaolong scanned the crowd. In addition to the Spirit Devil Patriarch, other patriarchs of the Spirit Devil Alliance had all arrived, including all twenty-one sacred lands’ patriarchs including the Floating Petals Patriarch.

Everyone’s here!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed slightly.

As he looked at the approaching Spirit Devil Patriarch, Floating Petals Patriarch, and others, Cangqiong Old Man cupped his fists in greeting, “I have made patriarchs wait for long. Pardon me.”

“You’re being too polite,” the Spirit Devil Patriarch chuckled amiably.

In the next few minutes, the Spirit Devil Patriarch, Floating Petals Patriarch, the others, Huang Xiaolong, and his master Cangqiong Old Man exchanged perfunctory greetings, smiling whilst not smiling. Talks and laughter sounded in a harmonious atmosphere.

The Spirit Devil Patriarch introduced the present sacred lands’ patriarchs to Cangqiong Old Man one by one, and Cangqiong Old Man also introduced the members of his group to everyone.

Cangqiong Old Man naturally knew that Yang Shangchen had secretly met with the Spirit Devil Patriarch, Floating Petals Patriarch, and the others. In the last four days, with Zhang Pei as the lobbyist, Yang Shangchen and the Spirit Devil Patriarch had reached ‘a mutually’ beneficial agreement.

Naturally, Yang Shangchen had done everything under Huang Xiaolong’s order. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Cangqiong Old Man finished introducing Huang Xiaolong, the Floating Petals Patriarch smiled faintly and said to Cangqiong Old Man, “Cangqiong Patriarch, we’re here to discuss about serious matters, so why would you bring a True Saint Realm disciple over with you. Won’t this make others laugh at you? Moreover, when we discuss things later, don’t tell me you’re going to let your disciple sit down at the same table as us patriarchs?”

Although the Floating Petals Patriarch was smiling as he said this, no doubt he was jabbing Cangqiong Old Man for not knowing what was appropriate.

After listening to the Floating Petals Patriarch’s thorny words to Cangqiong Old Man, especially when he said Huang Xiaolong wasn’t qualified to sit with them, Duan Feng’s face darkened in an instant. He sneered coldly, “Floating Petals Patriarch, on the contrary, we think you’re the one who’s not qualified to sit at the same table as our Young Lord.”

The Floating Petals Patriarch’s face turned unsightly.

Even though Duan Feng was a mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor like him, regardless, the Floating Petals Patriarch felt his status, as a sacred land’s patriarch, was higher than Duan Feng. Duan Feng was merely an expert from the small Cangqiong Sacred Land. How dare Duan Feng mock him in public?

The Spirit Devil Patriarch chuckled, “Those from afar are our honored guests, and since he’s Cangqiong Old Man’s beloved disciple, it’s fine for him to listen in.”

After all, Cangqiong Old Man’s group was destined to walk in and come out lying. Therefore, one person more or less, didn’t make much of a difference.

After hearing that, the Floating Petals Patriarch snorted and suppressed his anger for the time being.

“Cangqiong Patriarch, please, I’ve already ordered people to prepare a feast!” The Spirit Devil Patriarch invited Cangqiong Old Man into the residence.

Huang Xiaolong, Cangqiong Old Man, and the others walked into the residence.

When Huang Xiaolong was passing by the Floating Petals Patriarch, the Floating Petals Patriarch let out a harrumph.

Upon entering the residence, Huang Xiaolong noticed that there were many layers of killing formations arranged around the entire residence, and despite the effort to disguise these formations, how could they escape the detection of Huang Xiaolong’s three dao souls?

Huang Xiaolong looked calm as ever.

Every corner of the residence could not escape his dao souls’ inspection. In fact, every formation within the entire Ice Lion City was clearly displayed in his mind.

“Cangqiong Patriarch, please!” Upon reaching the main hall, the Spirit Devil Patriarch laid his laurels on the main seat before inviting Cangqiong Old Man, Huang Xiaolong, and the others to sit.

After everyone was seated down, the Spirit Devil Patriarch raised his wine cup and made a toast gesture at Cangqiong Old Man.

Then, the Spirit Devil Patriarch pretentiously made small talk with Cangqiong Old Man, while Huang Xiaolong, Duan Feng, and the others listened quietly on the side. The Floating Petals Patriarch and the others were the same.

After three rounds of drinking, the Spirit Devil Patriarch put down his wine cup and entered serious mode, “Cangqiong Patriarch, the main reason we’ve invited you over is to discuss about the future direction of the Spirit Devil Alliance and Cangqiong Alliance.”

“Alliance?’ Cangqiong Old Man’s reaction was a beat slow, “Aren’t we discussing peaceful coexistence? What alliance?”

The Spirit Devil Patriarch laughed softly, “After further contemplation, for our Spirit Devil Alliance and Cangqiong Alliance to coexist, merging into one alliance is the only way. If we form an alliance, then be it retreating and advancing together, won’t this be the best way of coexisting?”

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly. This fox is showing his tail so soon. The Spirit Devil Patriarch had mentioned peaceful coexistence in his invitation, and now, he was talking about forming an alliance. He was changing his words so fast.

Alliance?

The Spirit Devil Patriarch clearly meant for the Cangqiong Alliance to join the Spirit Devil Alliance, and putting it bluntly, the Cangqiong Alliance would be absorbed into the Spirit Devil Alliance.

“Spirit Devil Patriarch, you mean to have the Cangqiong Alliance enter the Spirit Devil Alliance?” Cangqiong Old Man asked sullenly.

At this point, the Spirit Devil Patriarch couldn’t be bothered to pretend anymore. He chuckled and said, “That’s right, Cangqiong Patriarch, there are only advantages for the Cangqiong Alliance to join our Spirit Devil Alliance. Our Spirit Devil Alliance’s twenty-two sacred lands are rich in resources. As long as you join us, you will be able to enjoy the benefits of these resources, and it’s something beneficial for Cangqiong Sacred Land’s future development.”

These kinds of words could probably cheat a three-year-old kid.

There was obvious anger on Cangqiong Old Man’s face as he spoke, “Spirit Devil Patriarch, you want to swallow our Cangqiong Alliance?! Don’t even dream of it!”

The Floating Petals Patriarch, who had been silent all this time, finally spoke coldly, “Cangqiong Patriarch, I advise you to agree quickly because today, you will have to agree whether you’re willing or not.”

The threat was so obvious.

“Are you trying to say that I won’t be able to walk out this door if I don’t agree today?” Cangqiong Old Man scoffed.

The Floating Petals Patriarch laughed loudly, “At least you’re not dumb.” He added, “I’ll tell you frankly, “We’ve already reached an agreement with Vice Hall Master Yang Shangchen, so Vice Hall Master Yang Shangchen won’t interfere in this matter between us. Therefore, your life and death is in our hands!”

“Deal!” Huang Xiaolong suddenly said, “We agree with an alliance.”

The Spirit Devil Patriarch and the others hadn’t expected Huang Xiaolong to suddenly interject and even agree with being absorbed into the Spirit Devil Alliance. Although they were a little displeased that a mere True Saint like Huang Xiaolong was interrupting their conversation, the Spirit Devil Patriarch laughed heartily since Huang Xiaolong agreed with the alliance, “Cangqiong Patriarch, look, it seems like your disciple sees the situation better than you, and is apt at protecting his life. This kid, he pleases me.” The Spirit Devil Patriarch looked at Huang Xiaolong as he went on, “Little guy, originally, you were bound to die today, but looking at the sake of what you’ve said just now, I’ll spare your life. Crawl over here and call me master, and I will accept you as a disciple under my name.”

The Floating Petals Patriarch frowned at this as he had wanted to kill Cangqiong Old Man’s disciple at the entrance. This kid was a thorn in his eyes, but it seemed like he wouldn’t be able to kill this kid that day.

But Huang Xiaolong looked straight at the Spirit Devil Patriarch and said, “Spirit Devil Patriarch, it seems like you’ve misunderstood my meaning. It is your Spirit Devil Alliance joining our Cangqiong Alliance.”

“As for you, you are not qualified to be my master, but you can become my subordinate’s minion.”
