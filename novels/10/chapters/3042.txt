Chapter 3043: It’s Has Been A Long Time Since I Laughed This Happily

After seeing that there were no more people who wanted to exchange for the mysterious stone, the auctioneer reported the items offered for exchange by Ren Fengyuan, Jin Xiaoxiao, and Huang Xiaolong to the branch master. In the end, the branch master selected Huang Xiaolong’s Void Reincarnation Thistle. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

No one was surprised by this result. As long as one wasn’t a fool, anyone would have chosen the Void Reincarnation Thistle. Thus, in the end, the mysterious stone fell into Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

But when the auctioneer offered to have people carry the mysterious stone to Huang Xiaolong’s place, Huang Xiaolong declined, “There is no need.” With that said, with one hand, he grabbed the mysterious stone across the air and took it away.

This slight show of hand surprised many.

“Early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm! Close to peak early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!” An expert exclaimed.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong was actually an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert genuinely surprised many. A small commotion swept through the guests. After all, no matter which top-tier creed or force they were in, a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert held a high status. Though many were surprised, no one was shocked. They had witnessed Old Monster Flame’s strength, and even the Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable, who had used Qiankun Palm, was slapped half to death by Old Monster Flame. Thus no one was really shocked that Huang Xiaolong was an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable.

“So, he’s an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable…” Nine Vision Young Patriarch Li Dongjun snickered. “And here, I was thinking that he’s some expert on the Extermination List.”

The experts around Jin Xiaoxiao laughed meaningfully.

“Have Senior Commander Yu Wen and the rest arrived?” Jin Xiaoxiao turned her head and asked Commander Liu beside her.

“Replying to the Princess, Senior Commander Yu Wen’s group has just reached Xuan City.” Commander Liu answered promptly and added, “They are awaiting orders.”

Jin Xiaoxiao stared coldly in Huang Xiaolong’s direction. “Good, have them wait outside. Let Dao Jianchou have a go at them first, and if Dao Jianchou doesn’t make a move, we’ll take action.”

Dao Jianchou stood up at this time, and with a single step forward, he arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong’s terrace, staring at the great blade. Then he looked feverishly at Huang Xiaolong and stated the obvious, “The auction has ended.”

He was speaking about the challenge that was agreed upon earlier.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, looking at Dao Jianchou, who couldn’t wait to get started. Just as he was about to say something, the beautiful auctioneer appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong and politely said, “ Lord, our branch master invites you over. He has something to discuss with you.”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the several branch pavilion’s experts behind her, and chuckled softly, “It seems I can’t decline your branch master even if I wanted to.”

The Clandestine Golden Fox Branch Pavilion sent many experts, and all of them were Dao Venerable experts. Their purpose was obvious.

The auctioneer smiled sweetly. “Lord has misunderstood. The branch master sent them here to respectfully escort you.”

Huang Xiaolong merely chuckled, “I’m really honored.”

He stepped off the terrace and walked away with the Mystical Pavilion’s group, and as he was passing by Dao Jianchou, he said, “Wait for me outside, one hour.”

One hour was enough for him to deal with the Clandestine Golden Fox Branch Pavilion’s experts.

Dao Jianchou frowned, but after looking at the branch pavilion’s experts, he kept silent.

The auctioneer shook her head inwardly, she didn't know whether this young man was pretending to be a fool, or really a fool? Does he really think he can come out an hour later?

Although she didn’t know why the branch master was looking for this young man, it was clear to all that the branch master wouldn't allow him to leave the branch pavilion so easily.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s group taken away by a group of branch pavilion’s experts, Jin Xiaoxiao sneered, “It looks like there are many people who want his life. I don’t have to worry at all.” She then ordered Commander Liu, “Pass my order to Zhou Hong, Tan Hua, and Sui Hengyi, and tell them to get over here to see me this instant!”

Commander Liu complied respectfully.

……

A few minutes later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the deepest part of the branch pavilion.

In front of Huang Xiaolong was the entrance of an independent space.

Huang Xiaolong was no stranger to this kind of independent space. The Mystical Dragon Fish Branch Pavilion Master Ceng Lei had invited him into this kind of independent space to refine pills.

Each branch pavilion had independent spaces like this.

“Lord, our branch master says he’s only meeting you alone, your subordinates can wait outside.”

At the entrance to the independent space, the auctioneer politely blocked Lei Yu, Old Monster Flame, and the others from entering.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at them, then followed the auctioneer inside.

Upon entering the independent space, Huang Xiaolong saw a middle-aged man standing in the air. His long, black hair, fluttered without wind, exuding a chilling coldness. It wasn’t that he deliberately targeted Huang Xiaolong as this coldness was related to the grand dao art he practiced.

The Mystical Golden Fox Branch Pavilion Master, Mou Baicheng was a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, and he had comprehended a trace of absolute frost power. Another person with amazing talent, and amazing combat prowess. Although he was a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, he could definitely put up a good fight against characters like Dragon Venerable Jian Huang, and Dao Jianchou.

“This is our branch master.” The auctioneer stopped a hundred meters away from Mou Baicheng and introduced to Huang Xiaolong, and then, she respectfully reported to Mou Baicheng, “Branch Master, I have brought him here.”

Mou Baicheng did not turn around to face Huang Xiaolong, and spoke directly, “Early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable? Your strength is not weak, and you possess astonishing wealth. You spent more than twenty billion dao coins without blinking an eye, and you even possessed a rare treasure like the Void Reincarnation Thistle.”

After seeing that Mou Baicheng had invited him here, but was refusing to even face him while talking to him made Huang Xiaolong almost laughed out loud. He purely found it funny. He hadn’t merely come to Xuan City for the Phoenix Fire Crystal, but Mou Baicheng was also one of his goals. However, before he went looking for Mou Baicheng, Mou Baicheng had come knocking at his door, and it looked like his spending and Void Reincarnation Thistle had attracted Mou Baicheng’s ‘interest.’

Mou Baicheng finally turned to face Huang Xiaolong after not getting a response for a long time, and when he turned, he was stunned to discover Huang Xiaolong was looking at him with the eyes of a predator.

“Mou baicheng, this space is… not bad.” Huang Xiaolong looked around and commented, “Fighting inside here won’t alert other people in Xuan City.”

Mou Baicheng felt speechless.

A strange thought flashed across his mind as he looked at Huang Xiaolong and he smiled sheepishly as he asked, “You won’t be thinking of attacking me, would you?”

“You’re right.” Huang Xiaolong went on, “In truth, before coming to Xuan City, you were one of my goals, and although your strength is only so-so, as a Mystical Branch Pavilion Master, you’re worthy of a slave position by my side.”

Mou Baicheng was stupefied. So was the auctioneer beside Huang Xiaolong. She looked at Huang Xiaolong with a pitying gaze. Regardless of Huang Xiaolong’s status, she could already see Huang Xiaolong’s miserable ending.

Mou Baicheng laughed heartily, and it was so loud that the space was shaking with his laughter, “Take me as your slave?”

He stared at Huang Xiaolong with a bright smile. “It has been a long time since I laughed so happily.”
