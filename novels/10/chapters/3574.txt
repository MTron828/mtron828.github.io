Chapter 3575 – I’ll Save Your Father

Huang Xiaolong had exhausted the resources in the thirteen universe and he could only head over to the Unknown Lands.

When they heard that Huang Xiaolong was planning to go, Wang Zaixu and the others requested to follow along.

However, they were rejected by Huang Xiaolong.

“How long will it be before you come back?” Jiang Shaoyu asked softly.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “I have no idea how long it will take. However, I promise you, I’ll come back in ten million years.”

Regardless of his progress in the Unknown Lands, Huang Xiaolong decided to make a trip back to the First Universe.

“You have to take care of yourself…” Jiang Shaoyu reminded him once again.

“I will.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Soon after, he left on the Blue Dragon Flying Ship. Several months later, he finally arrived at the entrance of the Unknown Lands.

Even though Zhu Qiming and the others knew how to enter and exit the Unknown Lands, Huang Xiaolong was unable to discover the method despite the repeated soul searches. He could only use the most primitive method to enter, and that was by tearing through the layers of restrictions.

Arriving at the place that stopped him previously, Huang Xiaolong tore through the restrictions that stopped him dead in his tracks before. With his newfound strength, the restrictions were like paper.

Keeping the Blue Dragon Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong flew through space alone. Even without the flying ship, his speed was terrifying.

Two months passed, and Huang Xiaolong finally tore through the final restriction stopping him from entering. He entered a vast space that contained somewhat different space laws from the thirteen universes. That was the only difference as everything looked similar.

The spiritual energy that filled the air was extremely pure and refreshing.

The Unknown Lands seemed to be paradise compared to the thirteen universes.

Releasing his dao souls, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the Unknown Lands was bigger than he had thought!

All of a sudden, he felt the Universe Sphere trembling slightly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Was that the Universe Boat? Huang Xiaolong felt a surge of joy filling his heart.

The feeling disappeared for more than half a month since he broke the restrictions around the Unknown Lands.

As he flew towards the feeling, he crossed cities after cities. Crossing god knew how many continents, the feeling disappeared.

Huang Xiaolong frowned as he tried to stimulate the Universe Sphere again, only to receive no reaction whatsoever.

Unwilling to give up, Huang Xiaolong tried several more times. He only gave up after dozens of attempts.

A light flashed in his eyes. Since the reaction stopped, the Universe Boat should be somewhere close.

After releasing his dao souls to search the entire area, he failed to find a thing.

The Universe Boat wasn’t an object one could find whenever he liked. If it was that easy, it would have been gone a long time ago. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t anxious in the slightest.

A moment later, he flew towards one of the cities in the area.

“Falling Water City…” Huang Xiaolong read the giant sign hanging on the city gates.

Looking at the walls, Huang Xiaolong could see the etchings of time along the city walls. It seemed to have existed for eternity.

Even though the city was large, not too many people left the city. There weren’t many people entering either. From the looks of it, there were several guards standing along the city gates, but they didn’t question anyone entering. It wasn’t difficult for Huang Xiaolong to enter.

Looking at the structures that surrounded him, Huang Xiaolong discovered that they weren’t as old as he had thought. They had a charm of their own.

Even though the city was vast, there weren’t too many people walking about. There was an air of lethargy surrounding the city, and everyone seemed extremely idle.

Slowing his steps, Huang Xiaolong enjoyed the scenery as he walked along the streets.

Along his way, a little girl ran towards him and grabbed him by the thigh. She cried, “Lord, please, I beg you. Please save my father! The members of the Zhang Family are about to kill him! Please, please save him!”

The little girl was nine at most, and she was extremely likable. Tears streamed down her face as she begged Huang Xiaolong again and again.

Raising an eyebrow in surprise, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“Little girl, please get up.” Huang Xiaolong lifted her off the ground gently. “Where is your father right now? Why are the members of the Zhang Family trying to kill him?”

Rubbing her eyes slowly, the little girl continued, “They set him up! They said that he stole the physique spiritual jade belonging to their family, and they said that they would beat him up till they found it! He was vomiting blood when I ran away, and if this keeps up, they will kill him!”

“I begged many people, and none of them agreed to save my father!”

“There’s no need to panic. Bring me there right now. I’ll save your father.” Huang Xiaolong dried her face and placed her down on the floor slowly.

She grabbed his hand and ran off instantly.

It didn’t take long before they arrived at one of the ancient courtyards located in the city. It was dilapidated, and it seemed inhabitable. However, whimpering could be heard in one of the rooms within.

“Beat him up! Beat him harder!” Someone yelled. “Old Man Tao, if you refuse to hand it over, I’ll beat you to death and hang your body on the city walls. No one will dare to take revenge for you.”

“Father!” The little girl ran into the room and screamed.

Following behind her, Huang Xiaolong saw five men surrounding a skinny old man. They were beating him mercilessly, and his identity was clear in a single glance. He was the father of the little girl.

Casually swinging his sleeves, he sent the members of the Zhang Family flying.

Including the young man who was ordering them to hit the old man harder, they crashed into a corner of the courtyard.

The sudden change caused the little girl’s father to stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“Father, I begged this lord to save you!”

The members of the Zhang Family crawled to their feet and the young man yelled at Huang Xiaolong, “Brat, you’re asking to die! How dare you interfere in the matters of our Zhang Family?!”
