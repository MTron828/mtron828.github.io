A trace of suspicion flashed past Huang Xiaolong’s face when he received the message. When he swept his divine sense across it, his face sank. “Huang Shiyi, Chi Hao!”

“Xiaolong, what’s the matter?” When Huang Peng saw the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face, he couldn’t help but ask.

Everyone became curious as well.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as he revealed the report to everyone.

When they saw it, they couldn’t help but reveal a complicated expression on their faces.

Guo Xiaofan roared with indignation. “Whoever the f*ck Huang Shiyi and Chi Hao are? They are too much! How dare they mess with my aunt! When we get there, I’ll smash his eggs! Uncle, I’ll take revenge for you!”

All the ladies present felt their faces turning red, and Huang Min smacked Guo Xiaofan on the head. “You and your ideas.”

Guo Xiaofan rubbed the back of his head and laughed, “I’m not kidding!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t say a word. Instead, he ordered the four odd beasts and the others to accelerate the ship towards the Changzhi Sect. Before long, they broke through the surface and arrived in the skies of the Datong World.

When they entered the Datong World, Huang Xiaolong made sure his subordinates released their aura. Without them consciously restraining their auras, the horrifying Emperor’s will from nearly two hundred Emperors crashed down on every single existence in the Datong World. In an instant, everyone felt as though hundreds of mountain ranges were stacked on their backs.

A jolt appeared in the hearts of all the experts present on the Datong World.

A replay of everything that had happened on the Fire Stone World happened. Not a single existence on the Datong World managed to escape from the horrifying pressure emitted by Huang Xiaolong’s group.

With more than two hundred Emperors, at the Ninth Order and above, releasing their auras all at once, it was more than easy to imagine the immense pressure landing on everyone present. It was as though the world was ending.

If Huang Xiaolong really wanted it, he could order everyone to attack at once and shatter the Datong World! There was no need to exaggerate. As long as Huang Xiaolong willed it, the Datong World would no longer exist!

The experts from the Datong World’s strongest powers couldn’t sit still under the weight of the pressure that was strong enough to exterminate the world several times over. Their bodies trembled like a leaf in the wind. Even Tao Yu and the various experts present for the ceremony fell to the ground in shock.

Huang Shiyi and Chi Hao stared at the source of the terrifying pressure with a flabbergasted look on their faces.

“This... this is?! That’s the pressure from an Emperor Realm expert! No, that’s the pressure coming from several Emperor Realm experts! How many are there?!” Huang Shiyi felt his heart pounding in his chest as his legs started to shake.

“Could it be that something big had happened on the Datong World?!” Chi Hao’s voice trembled.

In the hall, everyone felt unrestrained fear grip their hearts. They were overwhelmed with shock, and their legs nearly gave way. The only exception was Shi Xiaofei, who was standing tall in the middle of the hall. She stared at everyone in the hall with a suspicious look as she didn’t understand their fear. Even though she was also a victim of the pressure released by Huang Xiaolong and the others, it didn’t seem to suppress her as it did to the others.

Very quickly, everyone noticed the anomaly in the hall.

“You ... Are you not affected?!” Huang Shiyi stared at Shi Xiaofei as he cried out in shock.

Everyone turned to look at her with a look of astonishment on their faces.

Panic started to take over Shi Xiaofei’s sense of reasoning as she stuttered, “I ... I have no idea what’s going on!”

“Those Emperors seem to be headed towards us!” Chi Hao came to a sudden realization and screamed.

Those in the hall felt even more terrified when they heard what he said.

By this time, Huang Shiyi could also feel the presence of Huang Xiaolong and the others getting closer. An alarming thought appeared in his mind. “Don’t tell me they are headed to the Changzhi Sect!”

Tao Yu and the Changzhi Sect Chief seemed to react at the same time as they felt a shiver run down their spine. As for the other experts present, their hearts nearly stopped beating.

Headed to the Changzhi Sect?!

Could it be that they were there to congratulate Tao Yu during the apprenticeship ceremony?!

Tao Yu and the Changzhi Sect Chief both knew that they didn’t extend the invitation to any Emperors. The only person they had invited was Huang Fangtong from the Violet Phoenix Emperor Palace, but his disciple had come in his stead.

As Huang Xiaolong and the others approached the Changzhi Sect, the sound of rumblings in the air grew louder and louder. It was as though countless bolts of chaos lighting was running through the skies.

Before long, Tao Yu and the others discovered a shocking fact. Even the hall they were in started to tremble, and it felt like it would collapse at any moment.

When the turbulence in the hall finally stopped, Tao Yu, Huang Shiyi, and the others discovered that it wasn’t the end of their nightmare. A crushing pressure descended on them without warning and forced them to their knees. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Cracks spiderwebbed along the ground, and rubble rose from the destruction. The destroyed fragments of the hall hovered in the air before them.

Under the frightened gazes of all the experts in the hall, a black dot slowly materialized in the distance. It gradually increased in size until it finally appeared above the main hall of the Changzhi Sect.

Even though Huang Shiyi hadn’t participated in the Battle of the Heavenly Court, he was present for the Fortune Emperor Palace’s apprenticeship ceremony. The scene where Huang Xiaolong had trashed Wang Yongsen from the Fiend God Emperor Palace was still stuck in his mind.

Huang Shiyi’s body shook non-stop after he caught sight of the familiar face when the group of Emperors descended from the flying ship. All the words he wanted to say became stuck in his throat when he recognized Huang Xiaolong.

It was too bad he hadn’t linked Huang Xiaolong’s arrival with Shi Xiaofei’s claim.

Since Tao Yu and the others failed to recognize Huang Xiaolong, all of them could only shiver on the ground as they made guesses about his identity.

When Shi Xiaofei saw the familiar faces of Huang Peng and the others, a look of disbelief appeared on her face. However, that was nothing compared to the waves that rose in her heart when she saw Huang Xiaolong. The instant she saw him, tears poured out of the corner of her eyes.

She covered her dainty lips, and a look of excitement appeared on her face. She ran past Huang Shiyi, Tao Yu, and the others as she jumped into Huang Xiaolong’s arms. “Xiaolong!”

Xiaolong!

Tao Yu and the others stared at the scene before them in shock.

Xiaolong?! Huang Xiaolong?! Is Shi Xiaofei’s husband really called Huang Xiaolong?!

Wait a minute. Huang Xiaolong?! Could it be?!

When the possibility flashed through their mind, Fu Yangchen, the sect chief of the Changzhi Sect, felt his mind going blank. However, endless fear gripped his heart in the next moment.

Huang Shiyi finally reacted as he forced the greeting out of his mouth, “Disciple Huang Shiyi from the Violet Phoenix Emperor Palace greets Your Majesty the King of Hell!” He slammed his head into the ground in an attempt to kowtow to Huang Xiaolong after speaking.

Your Majesty the King of Hell!

Despite the greeting, Huang Xiaolong was hugging Shi Xiaofei, and he had no intentions of letting her go. It was as though he wanted to brand Shi Xiaofei’s soul with his own.

Shi Xiaofei tightened her grip on Huang Xiaolong’s body, and tears of joy streamed down her face. “Xiaolong, is it really you? I thought that we would never meet again!”

The thought of suicide had crossed her mind before. She had felt that if there were no other way of escaping from the marriage with Huang Shiyi or Chi Hao, she would kill herself in order to remain true to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong whispered into her ear. “Xiaofei, it’s me. From today onwards, no one will dare to bully you. I will never let anyone take advantage of you ever again!”

Tears formed in Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao’s eyes when they saw this heartwarming scene.

Even though several minutes had already passed, Huang Xiaolong refused to release his grip on Shi Xiaofei.

No-one stopped them either.

In the end, Shi Xiaofei realized that everyone was staring at them, and she loosened her grip. Her face flushed red when she saw that Huang Xiaolong had no intentions of letting her go. Leaning closer towards him, she muttered, “Xiaolong, everyone is here! They are all looking at us! Hurry up and let go!”
