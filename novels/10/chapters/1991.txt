“Yes, master. Four Masters can rest at ease. I will definitely use everything I have to kill Ao Li on the stage!” Dun Hao hastily swore. However, he paused for a second before asking, “What about Dean Reverence Moon?” He could see that the old man was protective of Ao Li, and he treated Ao Li differently from everyone else.

Bin Ge growled, “The only reason the dean made a move was because we ignored the rules laid down by the Radiance Ancestor. He didn’t do it to save Ao Li. Ao Li is merely a new face in the imperial courtyard. How can someone like him get close to the deanl? There is no need for you to worry. We will protect you from the dean’s wrath if anything goes wrong.”

Bai Luo continued, “Moreover, there is always a possibility of dying when competing. If he dies, no one will be able to blame you, not even the dean!”

“Yes, master!” Dun Hao respectfully acknowledged their orders, and he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. It was true. The Reverence Moon Old Man had hidden away for several hundred million years. Even someone like him had never seen the old man before. How could someone who had barely enrolled in the imperial courtyard know the dean?

The suspicions in his heart disappeared as soon as he thought about that.

Bai Hui snorted. “When you challenge Ao Li, provoke him a little and start betting with him. Make him take the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures out, and after you kill him, you will be able to obtain the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures fair and square.”

“Just calm your heart and do everything you need to do. As long as you manage to obtain the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures, we will treat you well. You can have the Radiance Divine Tome from the sixteenth floor, and we will give you ten thousand bottles of the Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills!”

The complete Radiance Divine Tome until the sixteenth floor!

Ten thousand bottles of the Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills!

It could be said that the terms were extremely alluring for Dun Hao.

A look of joy appeared on his face as he agreed. “I thank the four masters!”

“Get yourself ready.” Bai Hui said, “You made a bet with Ao Li to fight after half a year. It has already been five months. He should challenge you soon. Even though we are confident that you will win, you can’t get overconfident. That Ao Li brat is extremely unusual...”

Dun Hao bowed in acknowledgment.

After that, the few of them managed to agree on several things that they would be doing during the battle.

A day passed...

Huang Xiaolong and the old man seemed to have forgotten the flow of time as they chatted through the night.

All the Reverence Moon Old Man spoke about was the proud adventures he went through with the Radiance Ancestor in the past. Everything he spoke of was things other people had no way of knowing. Huang Xiaolong indulged himself in the stories and found them extremely interesting.

Occasionally, the old man would ask Huang Xiaolong about the things that had happened while he was gone.

Huang Xiaolong told him everything he knew.

The old man heard about how Dun Hao had managed to obtain the Radiance Divine Seal. He also heard about how Dun Hao had obtained the support of the four deputy deans to work with the Nine Yin Corpse Giant Tribe and Chiyou Archdevil Ancestor to destroy the Radiance Knight Corp and kill Huang Xiaolong to take over the Radiance Divine World. A terrifying light flashed through the old man’s eyes. “Don’t worry. This old man here isn’t dead yet. There is no way for those little sh*ts to jump about to do as they like.”

He turned to Huang Xiaolong and continued, “Do you want me to help you kill Dun Hao right now?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock. Cold sweat dripped off his forehead when he thought about what the old man just said. He knew that the Reverence Moon Old Man wasn’t bragging. With his strength, it was nothing more than raising a finger if he wanted to eliminate Dun Hao.

“Many thanks to Senior Reverence Moon.” Huang Xiaolong thanked, but he continued, “In a year, I plan to bring an army to attack Radiance Divine City. If Senior Reverence Moon can assist me then, I will destroy Radiance Divine City and kill Dun Hao in one fell swoop!”

The Reverence Moon Old Man nodded. “Fine. When you gather an army to attack Radiance Divine City, this old man will make a move. We’ll f*ck them all up!”

“Many thanks to Senior Reverence Moon!” A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he thanked the old man.

Shaking his arm, the old man opened his mouth, “There’s no need to stand on ceremony with me. Taking into consideration my relationship with your teacher, this is nothing.”

“What about Bai Hui, Bin Ge, and the other deputy deans?”

“If they really dare to support Dun Hao, I will smash their faces in! I’ll beat them till all their teeth drop!”

Half a day later...

Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Boundary Ancestral Mountain.

After leaving behind several reminders, the old man stepped into the air and disappeared.

As soon as the Reverence Moon Old Man left, Ao Ping rushed towards Huang Xiaolong and asked. “Brother... that... are you alright?”

Huang Xiaolong laughed in response. “Do I not look fine to you?” However, his laughter stopped, and his chilly voice resounded through the air in the next instant. “I’m fine, but I know someone who won’t be.”

“Go. We’ll go to the battle stage arena in the Reverence Moon Divine City!”

Ao Ping stood there with a dumbfounded expression, and he realized that Huang Xiaolong was speaking about his challenge to Dun Hao. A brilliant smile appeared on his face, and he raised his head and yelled, “Right! To the arena we go!”

The two of them left the mountain and emerged from the imperial courtyard. They quickly arrived at the arena.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong and Ao Ping left the courtyard, news of Huang Xiaolong’s challenge started to spread. In an instant, the eyes of all the experts gathered in Reverence Moon Divine City turned to the arena.

“Ao Li of the imperial courtyard challenged Dun Hao! This is going to be a sight to behold!”

“It might not be so. Even though Ao Li managed to gain enlightenment, that can only prove his heaven-defying talent. Strength is all that matters in the arena! Ao Li is a mere Second Order Emperor. He isn’t Dun Hao’s opponent!”

“That’s right. If I was Ao Li, I would cultivate with all my heart with the resources in the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures. It wouldn’t be too late to challenge Dun Hao after increasing my strength! He’s still too impulsive to challenge Dun Hao now...”

Along the way, discussions about the battle filled the air.

Qin Huangzhong from the Fengdu City and He Jingyi from the Misty Palace quickly ran over to the arena.

“It’s too bad...” Qin Huangzhong shook his head and said, “I had planned on recruiting that Ao Li!” Qin Huangzhong felt that the result of the battle had already been decided.

“Young master, why don’t we make a move and save Ao Li at the very last moment?” One of the ancestors asked.

Qin Huangzhong muttered, “If we make a move, we will be going against the rules. At that time, we will not only offend Dun Hao, but we will also offend the Reverence Moon Academy! It’s not worth it to offend so many people for a single Ao Li. Even if we save him, we might not be able to escape from the Radiance World. We’ll let him fend for himself.”

A day later, Huang Xiaolong and Ao Ping appeared on the battle stage arena. By the time they arrived, experts had long gathered around the arena and even a drop of water wouldn’t be able to trickle through the mountain of people present. However, a path opened up as soon as they saw Huang Xiaolong.

Since Huang Xiaolong had already challenged Dun Hao, he was waiting in the arena for Huang Xiaolong’s arrival for a long time.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother wasting time as he made his way to the arena.

Before long, the two of them faced each other.

“You’re finally here.” After a minute Dun Hao opened his mouth to break the silence. “Didn’t you make a bet with Ao Ping to defeat me in ten moves? Do you really think that you will be able to do it? If you regret now, you can still renege on your bet....”

“There is no need.” Huang Xiaolong stared at Dun Hao as he said, “Ten moves are more than enough to defeat you!”

The crowd turned restless in an instant.
