Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before accepting Fang Xuanxuan’s jade pendant.

Her pendant was faint yellow in color, rare for any kind of jade pendants. It was translucent and it seemed to emit a faint glow as streaks of red danced within it. Huang Xiaolong immediately knew that the pendant was made from rarely seen Fiery Gold Jade.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s gaze stuck on the pendant, Fang Xuanxuan’s face became even redder and she whispered, “You have to come back safely...”

A smile broke out on Huang Xiaolong’s face and he promised, “Of course.”

Fang Xuanxuan looked at the jade pendant and recalled something. “If you’re looking for my brother, remember to use the pendant. As long as the two of you are close enough, the jade will emit resplendent light.”

Huang Xiaolong heaved a silent sigh of relief. Things weren’t too bad if that was the case. He then started to question her about the jade’s radius of detection and some of the ways he would be able to locate Fang Mingyu.

When he was done, he felt that it was time to leave.

Fang Xuanxuan stared at Huang Xiaolong’s back that was growing smaller and smaller as he flew into the horizon.

“He’s already gone. What are you spacing out for?” Fang Gan’s voice appeared behind her.

Fang Xuanxuan snapped back to reality and her face flushed red when she saw the brilliant smile on Fang Gan’s face. “Dad! How long have you been standing there for?!”

“Didn’t you notice?” Instead of replying to her question, Fang Gan laughed and asked one of his own.

Fang Xuanxuan pouted her lips and complained, “How would I be able to notice? You’re stronger than me anyway...”

Fang Gan was stunned by her quick-witted reply and he cleared his throat. “Alright, alright, you seem to make sense there.” After that, he turned his head to look at Huang Xiaolong who was far off in the distance. “Xiaolong has heaven defying luck. You don’t need to worry about him, he’ll be back in one piece. Hopefully he brings Mingyu back as well...”

“Father, did Mingyu really head over to the Hell Asura World to temper himself?!” A trace of worry flashed past Fang Xuanxuan’s eyes.

Fang Gan sighed and said, “Your brother should have been back for the selections. Now, we don’t have any news about him. I’m afraid something really happened to him in the Hell Asura World. As the Palace Master, I am unable to leave the palace as I wish. Since Xiaolong is heading over to the Hell Asura World, we can only hope he helps us to look for Mingyu.”

“The Hell Asura World is a boundless land filled with slaughter and chaos. Do you think Xiaolong will be able to find him?”

Fang Gan couldn’t control his laughter, “What’s wrong? Are you doubting Xiaolong’s abilities? You can’t do that. You have to believe in him, after all, isn’t he your Xiaolong?”

Fang Xuanxuan stomped her feet and pouted, “Father, what are you saying! What do you mean by that?! If Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others were to hear you, things would be bad!”

Fang Gan didn’t bother about it and the smile on his face grew even wider. “Fine, fine, fine. He belongs to all of you, how about that?”

Her face flushed completely red and she cried out, “I’m going to ignore you! Why are you always laughing at me? Humph!” After speaking, Fang Xuanxuan turned around and flew away.

Her father’s roaring laughter echoed behind her.

Luckily, Huang Xiaolong had already left. If he were to hear their conversation, she was afraid she would die from shame.

While the two of them were messing about, Huang Xiaolong had already returned to the Dragon Tiger Palace.

Looking at the pendant in his hand, he thought about Fang Xuanxuan’s description of Fang Mingyu. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that it wasn’t possible for him to be Senior Fang Chu.

This allowed Huang Xiaolong to heave a silent sigh of relief.

If Senior Fang Chu was really the Fortune Emperor, he didn’t know how he would be able to deal with the matter. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Now, he had one less matter to worry about.

As for whether or not Fang Mingyu was Fang Chu, he still had to locate the Fortune Emperor’s disciple in the Hell Asura World before making his deduction.

When he returned to the Dragon Tiger Palace Gardens, he took Li Lu and Yao Chi along with him on his journey. Together with the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the Chaos Black Camel, they left the Fortune Emperor Palace and traveled towards the Heavens World’s Heavens Avenue.

Peng Xiao intended to join them, but after some consideration, Huang Xiaolong decided against it. After all, he was taking the two ladies to greet his master, the king of grandmist. He didn’t want too many people to know about it and since Li Lu and Yao Chi were the people closest to him, he didn’t object to them going.

There was another reason he wanted to bring the both of them along. He wanted to see if there was a chance for them to cultivate in the grandmist lands. He felt that they were too lacking in strength and if the king of grandmist could allow them to cultivate in the grandmist lands, they would undoubtedly be able to gain a lot.

Taking into account that chaos was about to break out in the Divine World, Huang Xiaolong felt that he would only feel at ease if Li Lu and Yao Chi remained in the grandmist lands.

As the Dragon Shark Flying Ship left the Fortune Emperor Palace, Huang Xiaolong allowed Lei Budong and Feng Chen out of the Tianwu Treasure Space.

Looking at the two giants who came out of nowhere, Li Lu and Yao Chi nearly fell to their feet in shock.

Huang Xiaolong could only start to recount the story of what happened in the Barbaric Space in the Floating Twilight Land.

Hearing that Huang Xiaolong had managed to become the King of Barbarians, Li Lu and Yao Chi found it pretty hilarious. When they saw members of the Barbaric Race addressing Huang Xiaolong as their king, they couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Looking at the two giggling beauties, Huang Xiaolong stared at them and said ‘viciously’, “What are you laughing at? If I’m the King of Barbarians, the two of you are the Queens of Barbarians!”

Their faces flushed red and they swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

Lei Budong and Feng Chen took a step forward all of a sudden and greeted Li Lu and Yao Chi respectfully, “We pay respects to the queens!”

With faces as red as apples, Li Lu and Yao Chi stared at the two giants blankly.

“Xiaolong, since they are the head chiefs of the Barbaric Race, they should be pretty strong, right?” Yao Chi felt a little curious about their strength all of a sudden. “Are they in the late Heavenly Monarch Realm?”

Late Heavenly Monarch Realm? Huang Xiaolong was startled and didn’t know how to reply for a second. However, he snapped back to attention and laughed, “They can definitely fight against late Heavenly Monarch experts.”

...

As the Dragon Shark Flying Ship flew further and further away from the Fortune Emperor Palace, a different scene was playing out in Zhou Chen’s palace. He stared at Yan Ying and asked coldly, “Have they left the Fortune Emperor Palace?”

“Yes, they have.” Yan Ying hesitated before continuing, “How are we going to deal with Huang Xiaolong?”

A sinister laugh escaped from Zhou Chen’s lips. “You don’t need to know how I’ll deal with him. Why are you so concerned for him? Are you feeling heartbroken that little gigolo is going to suffer from my revenge?”

Yan Ying covered her mouth and laughed coquettishly, “Don’t you know that I only have you in my heart? I was merely asking about him...”

Zhou Chen’s hands roamed freely around her body and his movements became even more unbridled after hearing what she said. “That’s good to hear...” He took out a secret talisman and it turned into a streak of light that shot out towards the heavens.

After three days...

Huang Xiaolong heard a report from Xiang Xun who was standing guard outside. “Master, there are several flying ships nearby. From the looks of it, they are here to look for trouble.”

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong acknowledged and stopped his cultivation session. As he left the secret room, a cold smile could be seen on his lips. It seems like they are finally here. He hadn’t bothered hiding his tracks when leaving the Fortune Emperor Palace as he was baiting Zhou Chen.

He didn’t have to wait for a long time as several massive flying ships appeared in his field of vision.

He felt a little surprised when he saw the fiery skulls carved on the body of the flying ships and a frown formed in his face.
