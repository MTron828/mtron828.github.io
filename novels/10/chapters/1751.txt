The faces of Li Shan and Chen Yirong lost all their color as they looked at the four terrifying beasts.

They were merely feeling the aura coming from their opponent, yet a feeling of death enveloped them!

What type of power is this?! Could they have already surpassed the Emperor Realm?! No, that’s impossible!

However, their aura was indeed a little too shocking if they were existences in the Emperor Realm.

Li Shan and Chen Yirong were not the only ones thinking about that. Even the men in black and the two special envoys thought the same way.

“All four of them are comparable to existences surpassing the Emperor Realm!”

Suddenly, a thought flashed through their minds.

The four odd beasts are only in the extreme peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm and have not surpassed the Emperor Realm. Their combat abilities should be comparable to existences surpassing the Emperor Realm...

Each one of the four odd beasts was comparable to an existence surpassing the Emperor Realm!

The strength of each of them was no weaker than the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch, Shi Wushuang!

The four odd beasts were famous since the Desolate Era and had exterminated hundreds of thousands of world surfaces with the Archdevil Master himself! Naturally, they weren’t ordinary peak late-Tenth Order Emperors.

The four of them were born with a special Archdevil bloodline with three stages of transformation. The first stage was the weakest, and they would appear in a human form. The second allowed them to grow to a thousand feet, and they would possess terrifying strength. In the final form, they would be in the form they were in now.

After the transformation, the four of them truly possessed strength comparable to an existence surpassing the Emperor Realm.

Looking at the four odd beasts’ transformation, a thought suddenly flashed past Special Envoy He’s mind as he vaguely recalled a terrifying legend about the Desolate Era.

Could they be?!

Special Envoy He’s face turned pale.

When everyone was still in shock, the four odd beasts stretched out and thrust their hands towards the eye of the Divine Desolate Glory Array. As though they were tearing apart a piece of cloth, the Divine Desolate Glory Array was ripped apart.

The array was torn apart, and the body of the men in black shook as they coughed out blood incessantly due to the backlash.

Next, horrifying darkness energy congealed around the eight giant hands and shot towards the black-clothed men. As if a dark cloud covered the sky, the darkness energy blotted out the heavens above them.

Everyone present was overwhelmed with shock.

“Bang!!!”

The men in black were shot down instantly like flies, and they smashed into the ground. Even Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen were no exception as they formed bottomless pits in the ground. It felt as though their bodies were smashed into bits as a wave of pain assaulted them.

Before they could take the chance to recover, they felt something stirring above them. When they raised their head, they saw a massive foot formed with berserk, darkness lightning stomping down on them.

Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen couldn’t help but scream.

Before anyone could react, the four odd beasts shrunk and transformed into their human form. They retreated behind Huang Xiaolong and retracted their aura. Looking at the calm expression on their faces, it was as though they had done nothing of significance. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Silence descended on the entire hall.

Li Shan and Chen Yirong were blown to a corner of the hall by the berserk strength in the distance. Their legs shivered uncontrollably when they saw the miserable state of the two special envoys.

They were high-level Emperor Realm experts!

There were nearly thirty plus high-level Emperor Realm experts!

However, they were now... !!!

Other than Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen, every single man in black was dead!

The four odd beasts were comparable to an existence surpassing the Emperor Realm! They were able to exterminate thirty high-level Emperors instantly!

Everything happened in a blink of an eye, and it felt extremely unreal.

At this moment, the restrictions imprisoning Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao had already been released. Despite that, the two of them stood there motionless as they stared unblinkingly at Zhou Chen and the people in black.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across and saw Li Shan and Chen Yirong standing at the corner of the hall.

Li Shan and Chen Yirong were so frightened that their lips started to tremble uncontrollably.

As for the remaining Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples standing outside the hall, they felt their legs going soft when they felt the might of the four odd beasts.

Huang Xiaolong retracted his gaze. With a wave of his hand, he dragged Zhou Chen before him.

By the time he arrived before Huang Xiaolong, Zhou Chen was on his last breath. His eyes were slightly closed, and his entire body was covered in blood.

“Huang...Huang Xiaolong, even if I die, you won’t be able to live for long.” Zhou Chen smiled forcefully as he muttered.

Huang Xiaolong heard this and smiled, “Hearing you say that makes me quite reluctant to kill you... How I wish to let, you keep your dog life and watch me enter the Emperor Realm. I’ll surpass the Emperor Realm and destroy the force behind you.

Zhou Chen chuckled as blood seeped out from a corner from his mouth, “Huang Xiaolong, stop dreaming! Don’t mention surpassing the Emperor Realm; you won’t even be able to step into Emperor Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and stretched out his hand suddenly. The darkness energy inside the Heart of Hell revolved and entered Zhou Chen’s body, causing him to scream in pain. Huang Xiaolong then pointed at the space between Zhou Chen’s eyebrows, and a miserable shriek filled the air.

The faces of Li Shan and Chen Yirong turned pale.

Because Zhou Chen was a high-level Emperor, his soul and will were extremely tenacious. Hence, with Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he wasn’t able to perform a soul search. After a few minutes, Huang Xiaolong asked one of the four odd beasts to search Zhou Chen’s soul.

In an instant, the odd beast finished the task, and all of Zhou Chen’s memories transferred to Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

“Great Lord?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

From Zhou Chen’s memory, Huang Xiaolong learned that Zhou Chen and the men in black were serving a mysterious ‘Great Lord.’ However, none of them had ever seen his face before. The only thing they could see was a giant face formed with light, and it was extremely blurry. Huang Xiaolong had no chance to make out his facial features.

Indeed, Fang Gan’s disappearance was related to Zhou Chen.

Despite knowing that that was the case, Huang Xiaolong only found out that Zhou Chen had handed Fang Gan over to another group of men in black. Even after searching through his memories, Huang Xiaolong failed to obtain any information about Fang Gan.

Even after searching the soul of Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen, the result was the same. Disappointment filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong’s heart jerked as he remembered Sun Shihai lying inside a pit. Waving his hand, he brought Sun Shihai before him.
