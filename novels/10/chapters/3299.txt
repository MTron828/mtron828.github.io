Chapter 3300: Smelling the Books

There was only a piece of news on Liu Chang when night fell.

According to the largest news station in the capital city, Liu Chang was dismissed from his position due to his corruption and he would be replaced by Huang Yuna.

The city would welcome a new female police commissioner, and the public went wild when they heard the news.

…

The library of the best university in the Huaxia Alliance wasn’t there for show. It was an impressive structure that had several dozen floors. There was an extremely futuristic look to it, and the entire building seemed to be constructed by some high-tech glass.

There were no guards in the library at all, but there were special doors that needed one’s identity plaque to be opened.

After Huang Xiaolong entered, he was greeted with the sight of a massive hall that was nearly four thousand square meters wide. There were countless students reading in the hall, and there were all sorts of books lining the wall.

Even though it was pretty high tech on the outside, the interior still had a traditional feel as the smell of books filled the air.

There were books on history, architecture, geography, and even books on culture housed on the sixth floor of the library. Seeing as there was no point in wasting his time, Huang Xiaolong took an elevator all the way up.

The lift was on the side of the main hall, and it was accessible to everyone in the school.

Just as the doors were about to close, an arm reached in to stop it. Six students stood outside the lift as they stared at Huang Xiaolong. There were a mix of guys and girls, and their looks weren’t too bad.

The person standing in the middle was a noble looking lady, and even though the aura around her couldn’t be compared to Shi Xiaofei and the others, her looks were pretty much there.

When the six of them saw that Huang Xiaolong was in the lift, they were stunned for a moment. His looks were enough to stun anyone who saw him for the first time.

The male student who reached out to stop the lift from closing snapped all of a sudden, “Get out of the lift right now!” Even though he wasn’t loud, he sounded extremely snobbish.

“Why would I do that?” Huang XIaolong asked with an expressionless face.

?! They were stunned to hear the question from Huang Xiaolong.

Does he not know who we are?!

“Brat, are you a new student in the university or are you playing dumb? Do you not know who we are?”

One of the other male students snapped at Huang Xiaolong, “Just get out of the lift when we’re being nice. Why do you have so much to say? Wait till we head up and you can board the next lift. Now, get out.”

“What if I refuse?” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

They stared at him in shock.

It felt as though they were receiving rejection for the first time in their lives, and they couldn’t believe what they were hearing.

“Brat, do you really not recognize us?” The male student who reached in to stop the lift growled. “I’ll give you three seconds to reconsider. If you refuse to get out, we’ll break your legs and throw you out of the library!”

“I’m right here. You can try whatever you like after three seconds.”

The six of them stared at each other in shock. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

With a sneer leaving his lips, the male student refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would be ignorant enough to think that they wouldn’t move against him because they were in the library.

Even though the university had rules to stop students from fighting on campus, nothing should befall members of the large families as long as no one died.

Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, three seconds passed in a flash. The male disciple circulated his true qi and sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong.

As the six of them were all students in the upper level, they were about to graduate. Their talents made them the cream of the crop students, and they should be pretty strong considering that they were still in university.

The student who was trying to punch Huang Xiaolong was called Lu Fang, and he was an expert at the Ninth Level Xiantian Realm. His strength ranked in the top fifty of the school and he could be considered a tyrant.

Anyone with his level of strength could pretty much move around uncontested around the school. Ordinary students like Lin Kai would be at the Fourth Level Xiantian Realm at best in their fourth year, and if not for Huang Xiaolong’s help, Lin Kai wouldn’t even be at that level!

Lu Fang’s true qi formed a massive fist around him as everyone was startled by the whistling of air as it shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Lu Fang made a move!”

“Who is that man? He’s pretty daring if he dares to antagonize Lu Fang and the others.”

Seeing as the fist was about to slam into Huang Xiaolong, many female students closed their eyes. However, a miserable shriek and a thud caused them to stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

The person lying on the ground was Lu Fang, and the other five who were with him were equally shocked.

From the looks of Lu Fang’s arms that dangled by his sides, he should be a cripple from that day on!

“I’ll break your arms this time. If you try that in the future, it won’t just be your arms.” Huang Xiaolong muttered before pressing the button to close the door. The five of them stared at Huang Xiaolong but no one dared to make a move.

They didn’t even know how Lu Fang’s arms were broken! Even if they were crazy, they knew that they weren’t Huang Xiaolong’s opponent.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had arrived on the sixth floor, Lu Fang roared in anger, “Brat, you better not let me find out who you are! I’ll destroy your life and that of your family!”

The Lu Family might not be part of the ten strongest cultivation families, but they were pretty strong. They could be ranked in the top thirties of the Huaxia Alliance, and there were a ton of members of the Lu Family in the military serving as middle tier officers.

As his friends helped him out of the library, the woman who was among them glanced at Huang Xiaolong who was on the sixth level.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother about anything they said as he headed straight for one of the shelves. He quickly started to look through the history books.

That wasn’t all. He even looked through the history books of other nations.

Even after suppressing his cultivation base to the peak of the Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm, his divine sense had reached a terrifying level. He only needed to flip through the book once to know its contents. He would flip through a book and place it back on the shelf, and he wouldn’t take more than a few seconds per book.

In the eyes of those around him, Huang Xiaolong merely picked up the books for a moment before putting them back.

After attracting so much attention with the Lu Fang incident, Huang Xiaolong drew even more attention with his actions.

“Do you think he’s really reading the books?”

“Reading? He looks like he’s smelling them!” Someone joked.

Laughter broke out in the library, and even the librarian could no longer take it. One of the female librarians walked towards him and growled, “Student, if you’re not here to read properly, please leave. You’re affecting the other students.”

Turning around, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the librarian was extremely pretty. She was prettier than the lady in Lu Fang’s group, and Huang Xiaolong had to do a double take when he looked at her. Even though he was tall, the librarian wasn’t too short herself. From what he estimated, she should be at least 1.75 meters tall.

Even though she was slightly angry that Huang Xiaolong was there to mess with everyone, he felt that she was pretty cute when she was mad.
