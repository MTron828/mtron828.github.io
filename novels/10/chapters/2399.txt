Chapter 2400: Wasted

Inextinguishable Dao Heart!

Even someone like Huang Xiaolong, who had three holy souls, couldn’t help but feel a sense of achievement.

With an inextinguishable Dao Heart, Huang Xiaolong could devour the grand dao of the Holy World like the four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens! By using the grand dao to temper his body he would be able to constantly refine his Saint bloodlines and holy souls!

When that happened, even a single strand of hair on his body would be terrifyingly strong.

After all, the chances of forming a Dao Heart when entering the True Saint Realm were slim to none. Only Primal Ancestors were existences who truly had an inextinguishable Dao Heart!

If he were to evaluate himself right now, his fleshy body was strong, but it was far from a True Saint Realm expert’s. Even First Heaven True Saints had bodies several hundred times sturdier than him.

However, with the Dao Heart, he would be able to increase the grade of his fleshy body. He would even be able to raise it to a level that could rival a First Heaven True Saint before long.

Moreover, there wouldn’t be any sort of holy martial art that he would fail to comprehend as soon as he obtained a Dao Heart!

That was the true allure of a Dao Heart!

Since the Dao Heart was formed by the grand dao of the Holy World, it was more than capable of comprehending any type of martial art. After all, no holy martial art could be made without comprehending the grand dao.

Obtaining a Dao Heart was like obtaining a key to understanding any type of holy martial art. In the future, as long as he willed it, he would be able to understand any holy martial art executed by the various experts around him. Moreover, comprehension wouldn’t be the only thing that he would do. He would be able to receive enlightenment when observing the execution of the various holy martial arts!

That wasn’t all! The might of a Dao Heart didn’t stop there!

In the lower worlds, the Heart of Hell could affect the state of mind of those around him. It was able to pull out the heart demons lying deep in one’s consciousness. Now that it had turned into a Dao Heart, its ability was enhanced by several tens of thousands of times!

Even though True Saint Realm experts were people who were pure and were said to be free of heart demons, there would definitely be a trace of greed or desire hiding deep in their consciousness.

Huang Xiaolong only managed to calm himself down after a long time. Finally, he settled down to devour the energy contained in the first tribulation before slowly observing the changes of the Heart of Hell.

By the time he had devoured the energy contained in the tribulation, the statue of the Four Seas Holy Emperor had already been fully activated. An endless amount of holy essence energy poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Two months passed quietly.

Fusing completely with the grand dao, Huang Xiaolong finally consolidated his foundation and entered the First Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

From that moment on, Huang Xiaolong had truly broken the shackles the world had on him. He tore through the Venerable Realm and broke the barrier that stopped him from comprehending the mysteries of the world. He was finally a half-True Saint!

Even though a peak late-Tenth Order Venerable was only a step away from becoming a Half Saint, the difference between the two was as large as the heavens and earth. If a peak late-Tenth Order Venerable was said to be akin to a god high above the masses, a Half Saint was a saint, overseeing all gods!

No matter where they went, as long as a True Saint wasn’t present, a half-True Saint was the supreme existence! The status of a half-True Saint was something even peak late-Tenth Order Venerables couldn’t compare to! Like the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate in the past, only half-True Saints were able to become doyens, entering the true upper echelons of the faction.

Despite entering the half-True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong didn’t seem too happy.

That was because the Heart of Hell didn’t complete its evolution into the true Dao Heart!

“What a shame...!” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had felt that the evolution of the Heart of Hell would succeed if he was able to continue to absorb the mysterious grand dao. However, the energy contained in the tribulation was far from enough.

What a shame!

Luckily, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t one to wallow in self-pity. He soon returned to his peak state and calmed his mind. After all, that was only the first tribulation. There were still eight tribulations to go, and the energy contained in the subsequent tribulations would be several times more than the energy contained in the first tribulation! By the time he crossed the tribulations, he would definitely be able to congeal the Dao Heart!

In fact, he might even be able to form the Dao Heart during the fourth or fifth tribulation! After all the energy contained in his tribulation was astronomical compared to those of the same realm.

After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t in a rush to leave the manor. He continued to swallow the holy essence energy coming from the statue.

The energy contained in the statue wasn’t exhausted, and he felt that it would take another month for him to fully absorb the holy essence energy contained in the statue.

After crossing the first tribulation, the Holy Mandate Imprint between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows transformed. It became a little more lively compared to before.

Under the guidance of the Holy Mandate Imprint, boundless holy origin energy poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body. It formed a thousand-mile-long river as it gushed into his body without the slightest resistance.

Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes were strengthened continuously. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Huang Xiaolong continued to devour the energy contained in the statue, the two True Saints standing outside the manor received a report from Yu Jingjian.

As soon as they read the contents, their expressions changed.

“What?! Lu Ding is back?!”

“Didn’t they say that he would only be back after several tens of years? Why is he back?!”

Only eleven years had passed since the time Huang Xiaolong had stated the inheritance.

“What do we do now? I wonder if Young Master is done receiving the inheritance...?” Chen Zhi started to panic.

“He shouldn’t be done... Even with his speed, he should take another year and a half....” The Departing Sword Sage muttered, “Moreover, he needs a little while more to assimilate with the inheritance.”

“Are we supposed to go hold Lu Ding back?” Chen Zhi asked.

“There’s no need to panic. Lu Ding will only be back after some time. Let’s hope that the young master will be able to fully accept the inheritance by them. The only thing I’m afraid of is Lu Ding bringing back the experts of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate....”

Chen Zhi’s heart fell when he heard what the Departing Sword Sage said.

They were confident of taking on Lu Ding, but it would be a little troublesome if the experts of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate were to interfere.

As the two of them were thinking of what to do, a massive flying ship tore through the space as it flew towards the Four Seas Holy Gate. Lu Ding was in the ship with Yu Fujiang of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate and several others.

Other than Yu Fujiang, there were two other First Heaven True Saints along with a whole bunch of half-True Saints.

“It’s our honor for Brother Fujiang to come to my Four Seas Holy Gate.” Lu Ding laughed.

“I have nothing better to do anyway. I’ll just stroll around in your Holy Gate. Oh right, I’ve heard that the Four Seas Holy Fruit is nearly mature...."
