Huang Xiaolong laughed as he turned his gaze to Gudu Canyang. Just when everyone expected him to make a move, Huang Xiaolong turned to Zhao Lei and said, “Master, let’s go.”

Zhao Lei, Bei Xiaomei, and the others were dumbfounded.

They only managed to react after Huang Xiaolong took several steps.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s back view as he left, Gudu Canyang of the Solitude Emperor Palace harrumphed, “Retard. Mentally handicapped trash who only knows how to put on an act.”

When the silver armored general saw Huang Xiaolong leaving without a fuss, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Even though he was under Marshal Yu Shi’s orders to chase the Fortune Emperor Palace members away, the General was afraid that Huang Xiaolong would harm him. No, he was more fearful of Huang Xiaolong holding a grudge against him.

After all, Huang Xiaolong was someone who had a king of supreme godhead. When Huang Xiaolong would mature, a mere general like him was nothing more than trash on the side of the road.

Moreover, if the Silver Fox Commerce decided to stick their hands into the matter, things would get ugly.

“Uncle, why don’t we head over to the Silver Fox Commerce? After all, we have a lot of space there. We should be able to take in several thousand people easily...” Bei Xiaomei turned and spoke to Huang Xiaolong. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second. However, he chuckled, “Do you think that one of the Emperor Palaces in the top ten would give up their manor if I gave them ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones?”

A variety of expressions filled the faces of everyone present.

“Ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones?!” Zhao Lei felt his throat go dry, “Xiaolong, are you really planning on doing that?” Even after saying that, Zhao Lei didn’t think that it was enough. “What the f*ck. If you give me ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones, I’ll be willing to sleep on the streets!”

Indeed, ten million low-grade spirit stones in exchange for their manor was something they didn’t even need to consider.

Ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones!!!

“Uncle, are you for real? In that case, my Silver Fox Commerce will give up our manor for you! Give me the ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones!” Bei Xiaomei’s eyelashes fluttered when she turned to pester Huang Xiaolong.

Anyone would feel their hearts shake at the mention of ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

Huang Xiaolong turned speechless. “How can I bear to let you sleep on the streets?” He turned to Li Shan next, “Li Shan, get someone to spread out the news. I don’t care who it is. As long as anyone of the top ten Emperor Palaces gives up their place, I will give them ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones. However, they only have an hour to take up my offer. First come, first serve. Only the first to respond gets the ten million.”

Since the night was falling, Huang Xiaolong limited the offer to one hour.

He was sure that everyone would be fighting over his offer as long as the news started to spread.

He wasn’t unwilling to blow this matter up. In fact, the messier, the better it would be!

“Xiaolong, are you serious?” Zhao Lei was shocked when he thought of what Huang Xiaolong was about to do. “Do you really have ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones?!”

“I obtained amazing treasures in Hell. Ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones are nothing to me.”

Since he had obtained the inheritance of the King of Hell, he could pass it off as a fantastic treasure, right?

“Go.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Li Shan.

Li Shan snapped back to reality, and he hastily sent out the disciples under him to spread the news.

Seeing as the sky was getting dark, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “The color of the night sky is fascinating... Let’s go. We’re going shopping. I feel like strolling around anyway.”

As soon as the news got out, Huang Xiaolong was sure that people would take up his offer.

“Xiaomei, I need to trouble you with something. Please help me to look for the people responsible for setting up my Fortune Emperor Palace.” Huang Xiaolong suddenly thought of something, and he turned to speak to Bei Xiaomei.

Since Fortune Emperor Palace held no grudges with Marshal Yu Shi, Huang Xiaolong felt that he was messing about because of someone else’s instructions. It probably didn’t have anything to do with the Solitude Emperor Palace.

Huang Xiaolong was sure that someone else was behind it.

Bei Xiaomei nodded her head obediently when she heard his request.

At this moment, the silver armored general was kneeling before a golden armored man in one of the luxurious manors in the Terrace of Heaven. He hastily reported about everything that had happened after chasing Huang Xiaolong out of Manor 61.

The middle aged man clad in golden armor was precisely Marshal Yu Shi, who was held in high regard by the Heavenly Emperor himself.

In the hall, there were several members from the Brightness Emperor Palace sitting on the left. On the right, the Azure Dragon Emperor, Chen Jianwei of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace was seated with the Bright Dragon Emperor, Chen Huoan. Gudu Wuyi and Gudu Nanming were there as well.

When he heard the report, Marshal Yu Shi nodded his head and praised, “You did a good job. Leave us for now.”

Zhou Han nodded his head and left the hall respectfully.

Turning his head, Yu Shi looked at one of the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestors and said, “Brother Xingfei, what do you think?”

The ancestor of the Brightness Emperor Palace was precisely someone who was smashed away by Lei Budong in the Grandmist Emperor Palace, Peng Xingfei.

Peng Xingfei chuckled and clasped his hands together. “I’ll have to thank brother Yu Shi. I’ll have to trouble you to increase the patrols in the area to interrogate some suspicious people.”

The people he was referring to were naturally the members of the Fortune Emperor Palace. He wanted to give Huang Xiaolong a hard time.

Yu Shi sneered in accordance. “Of course. Brother Xingfei, please relax.”

However, the general who had just left the hall ran back hastily.

Everyone felt puzzled at his actions.

“Marshal, I received news that Huang Xiaolong will be giving ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones to any of the top ten Emperor Palaces as long as they gave up their manor.”

“WHAT?! Ten... ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones?!” Everybody in the hall yelled in shock.

Even Marshal Yu Shi exclaimed in surprise.

“Are you sure?! Is Huang Xiaolong messing around?!” Yu Shi’s voice started trembling when he asked the question.

“It’s real. Mo Xiao of the Martial Demon Emperor Palace personally went over to speak to Huang Xiaolong. He’s preparing to give up the manor allocated to the Martial Demon Emperor Palace.”

Martial Demon Emperor, Mo Xiao! He made a personal appearance when agreeing to Huang Xiaolong’s condition?!

Everyone felt their jaws dropping to the ground.

While the people in the hall expressed their shock, Huang Xiaolong received news from Li Shan that Mo Xiao was ready to give up the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s manor in exchange for the spirit stones. He couldn’t help but snicker, “Mo Xiao? Hehe, haven’t seen him in a long time.”

In the past, Mo Xiao had tried to rob him in the Floating Twilight Lands. With the help of Huang Xiaolong’s senior brother, Jiang Hong, they had managed to reverse the situation. He even had the mid-grade chaos spiritual vein he plundered from Mo Xiao.

“Uncle, do you know Mo Xiao?” Bei Xiaomei couldn’t hold herself back when she saw how Huang Xiaolong was acting at the mention of Mo Xiao’s name.

Zhao Lei, Li Shan, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao turned their gaze to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong simply glossed it over with a casual reply. “Of course, I know him. Moreover, we have a pretty good relationship with each other.”

All of them swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

“Let’s go. Since the members of the Martial Demon Emperor Palace are giving up their manor to us, shouldn’t we give them a warm greeting?” Huang Xiaolong laughed and walked towards Manor 6. Of course, Manor 6 was the manor allocated to the Martial Demon Emperor Palace.

“Uncle... how... How did you get to know Mo Xiao?” Bei Xiaomei continued her interrogation as they made their way there.

Mo Xiao was a maniac in everyone’s eyes. He didn’t even respect the master of the Fiend God Emperor Palace... How could his relationship with Huang Xiaolong be good?!

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong once again as they awaited his reply.
