North of Crimson Devil City stood an enormous dark fortress. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In a space deep within the dark fortress, a demonic mountain hovered, at the top of which sat five people in meditation.

These five people exuded an immeasurable aura, dense devil qi surged like great waves around them. Every time they breathed out, it was akin to an army of vicious devils shrieking. All five of them were Highgod Realm masters.

Especially the crimson-haired old man in the middle, the aura from his body was terrifying despite him sitting still. Above his head, crimson devil clouds gently roiled about and merged as he breathed in and out.

A brilliant dark red light scattered down from the void above him akin to rain splattering on the great land, falling over the five people.

Slowly, the dark red light from the void dimmed and disappeared, causing the five people in meditation to open their eyes.

“Big brother, following this method of cultivation, our Five Ghosts Soul-Locked Vicious Ordinance will soon reach major completion.” One amongst the five, a slightly rounded old man said to the crimson-haired person sitting in the center.

“That’s right, after our Five Ghosts Soul-Locked Vicious Ordinance reaches major completion, let’s see how those several old ghosts from the Ghost Demon Valley act arrogant in front of us next time the Devil Cave opens.” Another of the brothers echoed in laughter.

The crimson-haired old man in the center smiled faintly, nodding his head. His eyes shone with a sharp black light, “This time, when the Devil Cave opens, the Demonic Devil Bead is ours.”

Their laughter resounded in the secluded space, wretched and harsh to the ears. The crimson-haired old man’s laughter suddenly halted as he took out a jade slip, his divine sense reading the message within, causing him to frown.

“Big brother, what is it?” The rounded old man felt strange and asked.

The other three people also looked toward the crimson-haired old man.

“Just now, Ruigu had someone send a message over saying that a stranger with strength that even he couldn’t see through came to Crimson Devil City.” The crimson-haired old man explained and described Huang Xiaolong’s situation to his four brothers.

This crimson-haired old man was none other than Bai Ruigu’s Master, the Crimson Devil City’s Castellan. The other four people were the Crimson Devil City’s Deputy Castellans.

Listening to the crimson-haired old man’s words, the four people became interested in Huang Xiaolong.

“This person casually took out a top divine grade spirit stone, no doubt he has a lot of valuable treasures on him.” One of the five, a tall gaunt old man whose pupils gave off a green light, stated while chuckling with undisguised menace.

This old man was called Gaunt Devil Shi Jiuxin, and was ranked fourth amongst the five.

“Fourth brother, as Ruigu mentioned, this person is not so simple. Even though he seemed to be a perfection stage late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm on the surface, you mustn’t be careless.” Crimson Devil Shi Jiutian reminded.

Shi Jiuxin chuckled nonchalantly, “Big brother, you’re worrying too much. It’s just a perfection stage late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm cultivator, how strong can be he? Could he be so strong that I, a late-First Order Highgod Realm master, can’t handle him?”

The crimson-haired Shi Jiutian contemplated and nodded, not saying anything further. Indeed, no matter how strong a God Realm cultivator was, it could never surpass a late-First Order Highgod Realm master.

On the other side, Huang Xiaolong remained in Crimson Devil City after leaving Bai Ruigu’s shop. He found an inn and requested for an independent courtyard since this Crimson Devil City was one of the four hegemonic powers’ main cities. He planned to stay a few more days and gather some information to pinpoint the location of the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s sealed body part.

Now, his biggest problem was that he was groping blindly, without the slightest clue where the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s last body part could be sealed. As long as he knew the location, the rest was easy.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong took out the Thousand Worlds Furnace inside, planning to refine some Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets in this small window of idle time, a whelming divine might whistled through space, aimed straight at him like a powerful sharp blade from an ancient era. It was diving straight into his soul sea.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed dangerously, issuing a cold snort.

In a split second, a bright dazzling light filled his entire soul sea, instantly shattering the trespassing ancient sharp blade. Without a pause, Huang Xiaolong’s palm struck onto a certain location in the void.

A booming rumble resounded from the void, so loud that every person in Crimson Devil City heard it.

A tall gaunt old man fell out from the void, right in the middle of Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard.

This tall and gaunt old man was the very same one coveting the top divine grade spirit stones on Huang Xiaolong, Gaunt Devil Shi Jiuxin.

Falling to the ground, Shi Jiuxin’s shock and disbelief were written all over his face. In his opinion, as a late-First Order Highgod Realm master, merely his divine might pressuring down on a God Realm cultivator like Huang Xiaolong was more than enough to destroy his soul.

Hence, before he came here, he didn’t put Crimson Devil’s reminder to heart. He, who was brimming with confidence, not only had his attack shattered by Huang Xiaolong in a split second, but his hidden presence was detected and locked on by the opponent’s divine sense. He was even injured by Huang Xiaolong’s retaliation, forcing him out from the void. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong’s vigorous palm force had given him more than a light injury.

“Who are you really?” Quickly recovering from his shock, Shi Jiuxian demanded angrily, staring suspiciously at Huang Xiaolong. He even suspected Huang Xiaolong was one of the devil sects’ Second Order Highgod Realm masters in disguise, sneaking into Crimson Devil City to wreak havoc.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Who am I? It seems you aren’t clear of your own situation.” Before Huang Xiaolong’s last syllable ended, he appeared in front of Shi Jiuxin in a flicker, landing another palm on him.

Huang Xiaolong’s speed was too fast for Shi Jiuxin to follow. Without any time to react, he was already sent flying by that palm attack, smashing into a fake rock mountain, onward to the yard’s wall. Then, he rolled out of Huang Xiaolong’s yard.

Shi Jiuxin felt as if every inch of his internal organs were jumbled up under Huang Xiaolong’s palm, the sound of shattered bones rang in his own ears. He was afraid and astonished at the same time, he cultivated an ancient devil sect’s Origin Supreme Devil Technique, his devil physique’s incredible defense was something even Crimson Devil, his Big brother Shi Jiutian, praised endlessly. But now, his prized devil physique’s bones shattered under Huang Xiaolong’s single palm strike!

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that every piece of bone in his body was stronger than most divine artifacts in the galaxy. In the last twenty thousand years since he broke through to the Highgod Realm, he had never been wounded to this degree.

“En?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised after he sent the gaunt old man flying, he had expected the other side’s body to burst after receiving his heavy palm strike. Merely breaking the gaunt old man’s bones was truly an unexpected result. It seemed like these devil cultivators were indeed stronger than the average human cultivators.

If Shi Jiuxin knew Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts at this moment, he’d vomit blood due to depression.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to end Shi Jiuxin’s life with another attack, a voice barked from afar: “Stop!” Though the voice wasn’t loud, it sounded like angry thunder from the ninth heaven, the sound waves surging into Huang Xiaolong’s soul sea.

Huang Xiaolong’s soul sea shook unstably from the sound wave attack.

A giant hand imprint that blocked the sky fell down right above his head.

Without hesitation, one thousand arms fanned out from Huang Xiaolong’s back. Each of the thousand palms bent their fingers into claws, countering the giant hand imprint.

Godly Xumi Art!

Following one thousand claws were countless evil wraiths flying out, entangling the giant hand imprint. This was Huang Xiaolong’s Asura Demon Claw.

Blast after blast resounded in the entire city.

The courtyard where Huang Xiaolong was staying in was pulverized into dust, and the surrounding courtyards were all destroyed.
