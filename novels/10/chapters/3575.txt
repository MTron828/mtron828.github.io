Chapter 3576 – Shopping

Tightening his fist, Huang Xiaolong dragged the young man over to himself. A miserable shriek rang through the air as Huang Xiaolong snapped his fingers.

“Caretaker Yun!” One of the other members yelled and charged at Huang Xiaolong. He was sent flying before he could come close.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the members of the Zhang Family and he looked at the person before him. “Do you really think your Zhang Family is something special?”

The man he spoke to didn’t reply. Instead, he sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest. Casually twisting the man’s wrist, Huang Xiaolong snapped it directly. A miserable squeal broke through the air once again.

“Hurry up and release me! Otherwise, you won’t be able to walk out of Falling Water City alive!” Caretaker Yun screamed as he rolled around on the ground.

Huang Xiaolong sighed when he heard the threats directed at him. Grabbing Caretaker Yun’s hand, he twisted it one more round and pain surged through the man’s body. Killing intent leaked from his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong, wanting nothing more than to skin him alive. However, he no longer threw threats at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered and he twisted Caretaker Yun’s hand yet another round.

“Lord… Lord… Please, let me off! I won’t do it again!”

“You haven’t answered me yet. Is your Zhang Family really impressive or something?” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Afraid that Huang Xiaolong would continue his torture, Caretaker Yun yelled, “We are part of the four strongest families in the Falling Water City! Our ancestor is a Primal Ancestor! Even the city lord doesn’t dare to offend us!”

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second, but a grin soon formed on his face. “Here I thought you had some supreme expert in your family. As it turns out, you only have a Primal Ancestor.” Huang Xiaolong sent Caretaker Yun flying with a single kick.

“Scram. If I see you here again, I’ll kill you.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to the members of the Zhang Family.

“Yes… We won’t dare to do it again!” Caretaker Yun stammered before running out of the courtyard like his *ss was on fire. The members of the Zhang Family followed closely behind.

The little girl and her father stared at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws agape.

“This old man thanks the Lord!” The little girl’s father fell to his knees and kowtowed several times.

“Han’er, thank the Lord!” He grabbed the little girl and yelled.

When she was about to kneel, Huang Xiaolong stopped them and helped him up. “It’s nothing worth mentioning.”

“Lord, you should leave right now! The Zhang Family is too strong and you shouldn’t be dragged into this!” The old man said.

Dismissing him, Huang Xiaolong snorted, “It’s just a Primal Ancestor. There’s nothing to worry about. Your meridians were shattered completely… I’ll help you reconnect them.”

With his body shuddering, the old man stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. “Lord, how did you know?!” His meridians were indeed shattered in the past, but that was a long time ago. That was the reason behind his decline in strength and he was nothing but a cripple.

Before the incident, he was at the peak of the late-Ninth Order True Saint Realm! A mere Caretaker Yun wouldn’t be able to touch him even if he tried.

“You can’t hide anything from me.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Shaking his head, the old man sighed, “My meridians were completely shattered. Not even grand dao herbs can be used to reconnect them. It’s impossible…”

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and pressed his palm on the old man’s chest. A ray of golden light coursed through the man’s body, healing every single wound and damage he suffered.

In a few breaths of time, the man was completely recovered! His meridians that were shattered beyond belief were as good as new!

That wasn’t all. His reconstructed meridians were even stronger than before! Energy surged through his body.

“This… This…” The old man couldn’t control his tears as he fell to his knees once again.

“Many thanks to the Lord!” Kowtowing profusely, he cried, “Tao Hang is willing to do anything for the Lord! In the future, I will listen to everything you say!”

In the past thousands of years, he had been living a life worse than death. He hid in the Falling Water City, prepared to die there. Huang Xiaolong’s appearance gave him a new lease on life.

A bitter smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face after hearing Tao Hang’s declaration. Ordinary experts at the God of Creation Realm weren’t even qualified to be his subordinate, much less a cultivator at the True Saint Realm…

“Tao Han’er thanks the lord!” The little girl thanked Huang Xiaolong when she saw her father kowtowing yet again.

“Alright, get up.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Only then did the two of them get to their feet.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the surrounding courtyard and sighed, “Why don’t you get a better courtyard?”

“We’ll listen to the lord…” With a look of embarrassment on his face, Tao Hang continued, “I… I don’t have enough spiritual stones or holy bills…”

“I do.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and waved his hand.

Even though he didn’t have holy spiritual stones or holy bills used in the Unknown Lands, he had grand dao coins and grand dao spiritual stones!

With his current identity, there was no way he could lack money!

The currency in the Unknown Lands might be different from the thirteen universes, but Huang Xiaolong captured Zhu Qiming and the expert serving him! The amount of treasures they had in their possession were worth trillions upon trillions upon dao coins!

The three of them left the courtyard and walked towards the Falling Water City’s market.

Even though Tao Hang had his meridians broken, he had lived in the city for thousands of years. He knew where everything was. It didn’t take long before they entered the largest Chamber of Commerce in the city, the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce.

“The Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce is the largest trading company in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. It’s owned by the royal family themselves.” Tao Hang explained.

Nodding slightly, he entered the building with the two of them.

As the largest chamber of commerce in the celestial empire, it boasted the largest presence in the city. The building itself was majestic, and it was the first time Tao Hang had set foot onto its premises. Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly when he noticed Tao Hang shrinking behind himself. Holding on to Tao Han’er’s hand, he smiled, “There’s no need to be afraid.”

Tao Han’er nodded obediently, “I won’t be afraid as long as you’re here.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Perhaps it was due to Tao Hang and Tao Han’er’s appearance, no one greeted them after they entered the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce.

Huang Xiaolong walked directly to a counter and brought out a bunch of dao coins. Tossing them out, he muttered, “I’m here to do some shopping.”
