Chapter 3663: Freak

Chen Bi stood rooted to the spot and he stared in disbelief.

He wasn’t surprised by Gui Chi’s strength! Instead, he couldn’t believe that Gui Chi would kill inner disciples of the Zhu Family! That was the first time he had seen anyone ballsy enough to kill a Zhu Family disciple in the Zhu Lan Lands!

Moreover, they were in the Zhu Lan City!

The three ancestors jumped in fright when they saw what Gui Chi did. They were paralyzed with fear as they had heard of Gui Chi’s reputation before!

Before Jian Wushuang broke through the 20 billion barrier, Gui Chi’s fame could be said to be even bigger than his! One reason was because Gui Chi was Lord Green Ghost’s strongest general. The second was because of his bloodthirst! The number of experts who died in his hands were uncountable! There were even sayings that if Gui Chi claimed to be the second greatest mass-murderer in the Unknown Lands, no one would dare to claim to be first!

“That ghost-like b*stard slave of the brat is crazy! How dare he kill an inner disciple of the Zhu Family here?!” One of the Chen Family disciples beside Chen Bi gasped in shock.

HIs words caused the three ancestors’ legs to go completely numb. If they were nearly paralyzed with shock previously, they were truly frozen in fear now.

Did the disciple of the Chen Family just call Gui Chi a ‘ghost-like b*stard’?!

Everyone in the Unknown Lands knew that Gui Chi hated people discussing his looks!

Their brains turned quickly. Wait a second. Wasn’t Gui Chi Lord Green ghost’s aide? Why was he following someone else now?FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They turned to look at Huang Xiaolong as extreme fear bloomed in their hearts.

Was that the person Chen Bi was talking about?!

They might not have seen Huang Xiaolong before, but their intuition told them they were looking right at him. Not just Gui Chi… Jian Wushuang, Yu Xiaohong, the Limitless Master, and the King of the Ocean Races were following by his side!

Zhu Yuan stared at Zhu Ding’s corpse in utter disbelief. Rage filled his heart and his face twisted in anger, “You… you’re dead!”

Before Gui Chi could kill the brat, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to stop him.

“We’re dead?” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Zhu Yuan could hear the mockery in Huang Xiaolong’s voice and his expression sank. Killing intent flashed in his eyes.

All of a sudden, the disciple beside Zhu Yuan whispered into his ear. “Brother Zhu Yuan, Lord Zhu Chenlong is here.”

Turning to the side, he saw a group of experts of the Zhu Family flying towards them. The person leading them was precisely Zhu Chenlong!

Zhu Yuan and the disciples of the Zhu Family hastily welcomed them.

“We greet Lord Zhu Chenlong!”

“Where’s Zhu Ding?” Zhu Chenlong said while nodding his head.

“Lord Zhu Chenlong, Zhu Ding was killed by those *ssholes! Lord Zhu Chenlong, please seek justice on his behalf!” Zhu Yuan cried in anger.

“What?! Zhu Ding was killed?!”

Killing intent shot up into the skies as the disciples of the Zhu Family heard what he said.

“That’s them! That freak who doesn’t look like a human nor a ghost killed Brother Zhu Ding!” Zhu Yuan growled.

Zhu Chenlong turned around to glare at Zhu Ding’s murderer, but when he saw Lord Gui Chi’s face, the rage in his heart turned into smoke. His expression changed drastically.

Before he could say a word, Gui Chi waved his hand again. Devils filled the air and the Zhu Lan City turned into hell on earth. The devils pounced at the disciples of the Zhu Family.

Zhu Yuan cried out in fright, and the experts who were behind Zhu Chenlong were about to make their move when they were stopped by him.

“Hold it right there!” Zhu Chenlong cried.

The experts of the Zhu Family were shocked and looked at Zhu Chenlong in surprise.

Zhu Chenlong ignored them as he walked over to Huang Xiaolong and Gui Chi. He bowed respectfully to Gui Chi. “Zhu Chenlong of the Zhu Family greets Lord Gui Chi!”

He then turned to Jian Wushuang. “I greet Lord Jian Wushuang!”

Then, he turned to Wu Xin and the rest.

“I greet the Limitless Master!”

“I greet Your Majesty, the King of the Ocean Race!”

“I greet Your Majesty, Yu Xiaohong!”

The experts of the Zhu Family felt their jaws dropping in fright.

Chen Bi and the disciples of the Chen Family couldn’t believe their eyes.

Zhu Chenlong, a venerated eminent elder of the Zhu Family, bowed to each and every one of the slaves who followed that kid around!

Wait! What did he just call them?!

“Lord… Lord Gui Chi?!” Chen Bi gasped. “Lord… Lord Jian Wushuang!”

There was the Limitless Master and the King of the Ocean Race too!

Moreover, the young lady he tried to flirt with was Yu Xiaohong, the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire!

Cold sweat drenched his back.

As for the disciples around him, their souls had left their body in fright.

Huang Xiaolong casually turned his head to stare at Chen Bi all of a sudden. Falling to his knees, Chen Bi’s excitement from breaking through to the God of Creation Realm was nowhere to be seen.

Ancestors Chen Bi, Du Chengjiang, and Xu Fei fell to their knees in fear too. Even though they didn’t know who Huang Xiaolong was, they knew he was an existence scarier than their worst nightmare!

Even existences at the level of Gui Chi and Jian Wushuang had to follow behind him respectfully! How in the world was that man from a third rate power?!

The experts standing around fell to their knees too.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Chenlong while Zhu Yuan’s screams rang through the air.

Zhu Chenlong felt his body freezing up when Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on him.

A horrifying pressure surged out from Huang Xiaolong’s body all of a sudden, and the city trembled in its wake. It was as though the city came under attack as every single protection formation activated. Beams of light shot into the air.

The weight of the universe seemed to descend on Zhu Chenlong and he was forced flat onto the ground. The blood drained from his face and he turned deathly pale.

Just one second ago, he was silently trying to estimate Huang Xiaolong’s strength. No matter how much he tried to overestimate the strength of the man before him, he didn’t expect himself to be wrong!

Even if Zhu Chen used his full strength, he might not be as terrifying as the young man before him!

Wouldn’t that mean that the youngster was even stronger than the old ancestor of the Zhu Family?!

“I didn’t know which Lord came to my Zhu Lan City. I, Zhu Ji, apologize for not coming out to welcome you.” A voice emerged from the depths of the Zhu Lan Palace.

Zhu Ji!

The Zhu Lan Celestial Emperor and the patriarch of the Zhu Family, Zhu Ji!
