Chapter 3128: What’s Going On?

“Princess Lei Qianqian isn’t the only one coming! His Highness, Hao Zhen, will be coming too!”

“What’s new? His Highness, Hao Zhen, will definitely appear beside Princess Lei! Hasn’t he already been rejected more than ten times?! I wonder what type of man Princess Lei will choose as her husband…”

“Whoever it is, it won’t be us! With His Highness, Hao Zhen, around, who will dare to approach the princess?”

The Red Rock City exploded when they heard the news.

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback by the sudden change.

“Your Highness, should we change a ship?” He Zhen asked.

However, a mischievous smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Why would we do that? Don’t tell me it’s because of Lei Qianqian… We’re getting on board the Heaven Pierer no matter what.” Huang Xiaolong knew of He Zhen’s concerns, but he didn’t think they were a problem.

After all, the number of ships headed to the Boundless City from the Red Rock City could probably be counted on one hand. If they decided no to get on the Heaven Piercer, god knew when they would be able to find another ship!

Ignoring the commotion going on outside, Huang Xiaolong continued to comprehend the power of metal in his courtyard. With his efforts, he had already reached the entrance of the gates stopping him from comprehending the power of metal. He was confident that he would comprehend the power of metal in a year.

Of course, it was because Huang Xiaolong absorbed the memories of the Golden Fox Region Lord in the past. He used that, along with his Dazzling Gold Stone in order to hasten his understanding of the power of metal.

A night passed in the blink of an eye, and the first rays of dawn shone on the lands.

Riding on Lei Yu, Huang Xiaolong and the others headed straight for the Heaven Piercer.

As the ship was humongous, it stopped in one of the northernmost plazas. Of course, the plaza belonged to the Treasure Lake Chamber of Commerce.

By the time Huang Xiaolong arrived, he saw a sea of people waiting around the ship.

The Heaven Piercer spanned several dozen thousand miles long, and there were a million cabins on it. Ordinarily, it would be good if they sold more than three hundred thousand tickets to the Boundless City. However, every single ticket was sold out because of Lei Qianqian’s appearance!

As disciples of the Origin Races piled onto the Heaven Piercer, disciples of the Human Race followed.

Huang Xiaolong even saw several experts from the Death Beasts Peril Lands.

Even with the ten beast kings’ authority, they only ruled over ninety percent of the Death Beast Lands. There were some parts not under their control, and the number of experts who populated the place couldn’t be counted.

“Let’s board the ship.” Huang Xiaolong ignored everyone as he brought out thirteen jade tablets.

However, he was stopped by someone as soon as he boarded.

“Our young master would like to buy all the tickets you have.” Someone asked.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the silver horn on the other party’s head and he sneered, “Where am I supposed to go if you buy my tickets?”

As the first-class tickets were bought by Lei Qianqian and the others, the superpowers could only set their sights on the second-class cabins. They wanted to get as close as they could to Lei Qianqian, and that was the only way for them to do so.

The person asking Huang Xiaolong for the tickets were from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, and they were only weaker than the top ten races in the Origin Lands.

The expert from the Silver Horn Race sneered, “We have tickets for the fourth-class cabins. Go sit there instead. We’ll pay you full price for your second-class tickets.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I don’t intend to trade it with you. You can get out of my sight now.”

The silver horned expert was slightly taken aback. He didn’t expect a mere human to reject his suggestion.

After all, everyone would bow down to him the moment they realized he was from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race.

The fourth-class cabins might be a lot worse than the second-class cabins, but no one would offend the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race for several tickets. They even planned to pay Huang Xiaolong in full for the tickets!

A snort left the lips of the expert from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race. “Are you sure?”

Huang Xiaolong ignored the man completely as they made their way towards the second-class cabins.

With his expression sinking, the expert from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race moved to block Huang Xiaolong’s way. Just before he could speak, Lei Yu sent him packing with a single kick.

Everyone in the surroundings fell silent as they watched the scene playing out before them.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the man as he continued to make his way forward.

When he finally reached the location of the second-class cabins, he used the jade tablets to enter.

As soon as he stepped into the area, he was stunned. Every single cabin there had a tiny palace, and they were fully stocked with pill furnaces, spiritual tea, and endless libraries of books.

It was a completely different scene in the fourth-class cabin area. Those there would only obtain a simple room, and the furnishing was several tiers worse.

Of course, the first-class cabins were leagues ahead of whatever Huang Xiaolong was experiencing.

When Huang Xiaolong entered his cabin, a group of experts from the Lightning Phoenix Race and the Nine Eyed Black Tiger Race sat in one of the halls in the first-class cabins.

A young man and a young lady sat on the thrones in the main hall, and they emitted a horrifying aura. The lady was extremely elegant, and her facial features were beyond perfect. If anyone laid eyes on her, they would lose themselves in her beauty.

The two of them were naturally Lei Qianqian and Hao Zhen.

“What’s going on out there?” Lei Qianqian asked. When Lei Yu sent the expert from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race flying, it caused quite the commotion.

The experts of the Lightning Phoenix Race quickly reported back to the two of them.

When they heard what happened, Lei Qianqian and Hao Zhen were slightly taken aback.

However, a cold snort left Hao Zhen’s lips. “The humans are acting too arrogantly! How dare they make a move on an eminent elder of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race?!”

A light flashed in Lei Qianqian’s eyes. “If they dare to ignore the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, they should be someone of some importance among the human race. Moreover, his mount doesn't seem weak.”

Hao Zhen’s gaze landed on one of the experts from the Nine Eyed Black Tiger Race. “Look into the human’s background. Get someone from the Treasure Lake Chamber of Commerce to warn the kid. If he dares to cause any trouble, kick him off the ship.”

Even though the Nine Eyed Black Tiger Race didn’t control the Treasure Lake Chamber of Commerce, they had to pay some attention to the words of the young patriarch of the Nine Eyed Black Tiger Race.

It didn’t take long for the experts of the Treasure Lake Chamber of Commerce to come knocking on Huang Xiaolong’s palace.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
