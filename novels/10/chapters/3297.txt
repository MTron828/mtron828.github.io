Chapter 3298: Senior Huang How Are You Doing?

When they saw the grand elder charging out of the manor, the elders stared at each other in shock.

“This… Do we really interrupt the old ancestor’s cultivation for this?”

The old ancestor of the Liu Family hated to be disturbed. There was an elder who received heavy punishment for interrupting him once!”

“Let’s just do it…” Someone sighed. After all, Liu Shengyuan’s actions were too damn weird. There had to be something wrong if he was so worked up.

…

As Huang Xiaolong stood facing the giant army that was charging towards him, not a shred of emotion could be seen on his face.

Instead, Liu Pinchen rushed over to Liu Chang as though he had seen the light at the end of the tunnel. “You’re finally here!”

Nodding slightly, Liu Chang looked at the corpse of Zou Ru on the ground and grieved, “Second brother, I came too late… You can relax now. I will definitely kill this man in order to take revenge for Zou Ru!”

“Zou Ru died a miserable death! You have to kill that motherf*cker in the worst way possible!” Hatred flashed through his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong.

The scene before his eyes changed as soon as he was done speaking and he appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

With two fingers, Huang Xiaolong raised Liu Pinchen by the neck. A trace of anger flashed through his eyes. “What did you just call me?”

Liu Pinchen thought that with Liu Chang and the purple canons, Huang Xiaolong would be too afraid to move against him. As such, he roared with laughter, “You heard me! You’re a motherf*cker! Do you really dare to kill me?”

Exerting a little strength in his hands, Huang Xiaolong snapped Liu Pinchen’s neck.

With his eyes bulging in shock, it was clear he didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong would dare to make a move with so many people backing him up.

“Pinchen!” Liu Chang roared in anger. “Open fire! Kill this motherf*cker! Kill him right now!”

As soon as he gave the order, the canons lit up. Brilliant rays lit up the skies and every single policeman on the street opened fire. Everything turned blurry in an instant.

However, all it took was a soft snort from Huang Xiaolong to stop everything flying his way. Time seemed to have stopped as the rays of light that came from the canon froze in mid air. Like before, the attacks returned to those who unleashed it. The flying ships and vehicles were torn apart in an instant.

Countless officers were sent flying through the streets.

Blood stained the lands. But Huang Xiaolong didn’t kill a single one of them. All of them were seriously injured, but none of their lives were in danger.

When everyone standing around saw what happened, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

There were more than a hundred purple canons on the flying ships, and a single one of them was enough to injure an expert in the Nascent Soul Realm! With more than a hundred of them, they should be able to kill a high-level Nascent Soul Realm cultivator!

However, they were defeated in an instant!

Liu Chang, who was commanding the troops, stared at the scene of destruction with terror in his eyes.

Turning to Liu Chang, Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Snapping back to reality, he screamed in horror, “Who the hell are you?!”

There was no way a high-level Nascent Soul Realm cultivator could stop the bombardment. At best, they would be able to dodge the attacks. They didn’t possess the ability to send the attacks back to the shops!

Unless…

Enlightenment Realm!

A terrifying thought flashed through Liu Chang’s head.

A shriek pierced the silence a moment later as someone caught sight of Liu Chang who was lying lifelessly in the middle of the street. There was a bloodied hole on his forehead, and blood didn’t stop flowing.

It was a sight to behold as Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Liu Decong. When the kid met his gaze, the stench of urine filled the air.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong looked at Lin Kai and signaled for him to return back to the flying ship. Following Huang Xiaolong, Lin Kai had no idea what was going on. In fact, he was surprised he remembered how to talk.

Everything that happened played out in his brain again and again.

His uncle killed the commissioner of the police force in the capital city! His heart was pounding in fear as he felt his limbs going cold. If he didn’t know better, he would think that he caught a cold!

Everyone watched on as the flying ship slowly departed.

When they finally left, the entire scene exploded into a flurry of emotions.

“Liu Chang, the police commissioner, was killed on the streets! That’s definitely something that will make the headlines! Who is that youngster?! He’s too damn cool!”

“Hehe, the television will be all over this story in a little bit. Do you think that young man came from one of the six sects?! I don’t think an expert of his level exists in our Huaxia Alliance… For someone to survive the bombardment of more than a hundred purple canons… Even if he isn’t in the Enlightenment Realm, he should be close!”

Discussions flew about.

In the flying ship, Lin Kai was stuck in a state of shock as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “Uncle… Do you think anything will happen to us now that we killed the police commissioner?”

“What do you think?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly.

Lin Kai’s expression changed, and Huang Xiaolong reassured him, “Relax. Nothing is going to happen to us.”

If the battle in the Blue Dragon Orchard didn’t happen, the members of the Liu Family might go all the way to look for trouble. However, there was no way they could do something like that now.

As long as the members of the Liu Family gave up, no one would harp on the matter.

Several minutes later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the gates of the Eastern University with Lin Kai. Retrieving the flying ship, he looked at the perfect entrance standing before him. Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. In the past, he planned to enter the Eastern University after his final exam. However, he disappeared before that could happen. Now that he had arrived at the Eastern University, he was there as their deputy head.

After flashing their identity plaques, the two of them were allowed to enter the campus.

As Huang Xiaolong wasn’t too familiar with the area, Lin Kai brought him over to the principal’s office.

When they arrived, they saw three figures sitting outside. There was a bald man, a skinny elder, and another pretty lady who looked to be in her thirties.

The three of them reacted differently when they saw Huang Xiaolong. The woman stared at Huang Xiaolong unblinkingly, and it was clear his looks had a lot to do with it.

The skinny old man raised his head slightly before turning back to his newspaper. The only person who had a stronger reaction was the baldy. He frowned and lectured the two of them, “Which year are you in? Do you think you’re qualified to look for the principal as you please?”

Lin Kai interrupted him before he could go further. “He’s my uncle, and he’s the new deputy head of the school.”

New deputy head of the school!

The bald man and the lady were shocked, and they couldn’t believe what they saw. The skinny old man was the only one who didn’t react like them. Jumping to his feet, he ran over to Huang Xiaolong and he stretched out his hand. A trace of reverence could be heard in his voice when he addressed Huang Xiaolong. “Senior Huang, nice to meet you! I’m the principal of the university, Murong Qing! You should have informed me when you arrived! There’s no need for you to come all the way here to look for me!”

There was a trace of fear and excitement in his heart when he addressed Huang Xiaolong.

“Are you from the Murong Family?” Huang Xiaolong asked.
