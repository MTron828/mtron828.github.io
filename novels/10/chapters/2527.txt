Chapter 2528: Barren Lands and the Black Sea

Huang Xiaolong shattered illusion after illusion as he entered the second floor in a matter of days.

When he arrived, he looked around only to be greeted with the sight of barren land. It was different from the scenery on the first floor! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Countless evil beasts crawled about like undead cockroaches along the barren lands, and bloodied holes could be seen all over their bodies. It was a truly a disgusting sight.

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath and tore through the sandstorm covering the barren lands, and entered the barren lands.

The moment he stepped foot inside, he was attacked by a swarm of the evil beasts.

None of the beasts were too strong, and they were around the Seventh to Eighth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm. Huang Xiaolong didn’t activate his holy souls, and he killed them with the Flying Heaven Blood Stele.

He left behind a trail of blood as he killed his way forward.

Despite their relatively weak strength, they were endless. After several days of killing, even someone like Huang Xiaolong felt a little tired.

Moreover, the evil beasts weren’t the only beings on the second floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor. There were countless restrictions and illusions threatening him at every moment. In addition to everything he had experienced on the first floor, there were several disasters waiting for him.

An example would be the weird rain that poured down on him when he was killing the evil beasts. The rain was formed from a type of darkness-attributed water. As long as one came into contact with it, their bodies would start to rot.

Lightning clouds would gather from time to time to send out several lightning bolts at Huang Xiaolong along the way.

Even though they were weaker than the lightning bolts he had experienced when crossing the fifth tribulation, it was a little irritating to endure the lightning strikes as he made his way across the barren lands.

Despite his ‘horrifying’ strength, Huang Xiaolong suffered no small amounts of pain.

After an entire month, Huang Xiaolong lost count of the number of evil beasts that died at his hands. The illusions he broke were countless, and the number of disasters he survived no longer mattered. No matter how hard he tried, he failed to locate the entrance to the third floor.

Other than an endless stretch of land, there was nothing else.

One more month passed and Huang Xiaolong could no longer endure the boring days. Finally, he had no choice but to look for a place for a short break.

Since there was no moon in the skies in the palace, the barren land was shrouded in darkness as soon as night fell. Weird noises entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears from time to time.

Standing on a tiny hill, Huang Xiaolong stared at the group of beasts surrounding him, and his thoughts drifted to Lin Xiaoying. He couldn’t help but wonder how she was doing.

With her strength, she should have entered the second floor, right?

There was also Tan Juan, Li Chen, Xie Bufan, Ji Xinyi, and the others…

Ever since he had entered, Huang Xiaolong had failed to catch sight of Tan Juan, Xie Bufan, or Li Chen.

However, he was confident that he was currently in the lead. With his Inextinguishable Dao Heart, he could break through the illusions and restrictions with ease. No matter how talented or how many treasures Tan Juan and the others had up their sleeves, they couldn’t catch up to him.

Moreover, he had three great holy souls that allowed him to detect the disasters that were about to befall him. That was an advantage they didn’t have.

They would be seriously injured if they failed to escape from the heavenly disaster that descended on them.

After a short rest, Huang Xiaolong continued on his way to look for the entrance to the third floor the next day.

Half a month passed once again, and he finally managed to locate the entrance to the third floor!

As soon as he saw the third floor, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

Finally!

The moment he passed the third floor, he would no longer be held down by the insane amount of restrictions. Not to mention, the absence the heavenly disasters. When that happened, it would be time to harvest all the herbs he wanted.

However, he knew that the third floor would only be more difficult to pass than the second floor.

Upon looking at the endless black sea on the third floor, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before entering the space above it.

The black sea was deathly calm. It wasn’t merely quiet, but there was a trace of death hidden behind the stillness. It felt a little desolate, and a little bleak. It was as though nothing could survive in the black sea.

A sudden feeling crossed Huang Xiaolong’s mind, and he thought that he had gone deaf for a moment. Even his heartbeat fell silent.

The calm environment didn’t last for long as a strange sound wave entered Huang Xiaolong’s mind in the next instant. Countless sound waves started to gather as they slammed into his holy soul.

When Huang Xiaolong entered the third floor, everyone’s sights, outside the Cangqiong Holy Manor, turned towards the third floor.

As long as a disciple entered the next floor, a brilliant light would light up the respective floor.

Everyone broke out into discussions the moment Huang Xiaolong entered the third floor.

“Master, the person who entered the third floor should be Juan’er, right? With her strength and talent, it would be a breeze for her to barge into the fourth floor…,” Xue Lingyun turned to the Cangqiong Old Man and asked.

According to what she knew, Tan Juan was the strongest among the younger generation disciples. With her Frozen Snow Imprint, she was the only person who could enter the third floor before the rest!

Cao Nan snorted when he heard what she said. “Dao Friend Lingyun, why are you so sure Tan Juan of your Clear Snow Palace has entered the third floor? For all we know, Xie Bufan could have entered the third floor before her.

“Even if you managed to obtain the first spot in the Trial of Blood, this is no longer a place for you to mess around.” Cao Nan snorted. “Xie Bufan will definitely enter the sixth floor before Tan Juan, and he’ll locate the key to the seventh floor!”

Tyrant Chu chuckled at the side, “Who the f*ck is Xie Bufan? Li Chen or my dear disciple Huang Xiaolong should be the one to have entered the third floor. With my disciple’s three Saint godheads, he will definitely be able to receive Dao Friend Cangqiong’s inheritance!”

“Hahaha! Huang Xiaolong entered the third floor?! This is the greatest joke I’ve heard in my years of existence! Tyrant Chu, Huang Xiaolong only managed to obtain the fifth place in the trial due to luck. Do you think luck lasts forever?” Cao Nan snorted.

“Heh! He probably won’t be able to enter the fourth floor! Even with his holy soul, he’s only a Fifth Tribulation half-True Saint. The time he has cultivated, it wouldn’t be enough to comprehend the grand dao! So he’ll probably be stuck in the second floor forever!” Cao Na continued.

The members of the Devil Palace roared with laughter.

…

As dozens of thousands of feet high waves slammed towards Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t plan to take them on as he dodged them.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t discover it at first, but he eventually realized that a single drop of water from the black sea was comparable to the weight of a mountain formed from chaos stones!
