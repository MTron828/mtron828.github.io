Chapter 2415: He Can’t Be Any Stronger Than An Eighth Order Venerable

Since Huang Xiaolong had no idea what happened after he left, he didn’t return to speak to his masters. Instead, he left for the Blue Dragon Manor.

Now that he was back, Huang Xiaolong planned to spend more time with Zhang Wenyue and the others.

Even though cultivating in the Primal Ancestors’ space was a little more effective, Huang Xiaolong had the Holy Mandate Imprint. He had a ton of origin spiritual pills, and the effects of cultivating in the Blue Dragon Manor wouldn’t fall too far off.

“Young Master, don’t you think we need more guards?” Zhang Wenyue asked Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden.

When Huang Xiaolong had purchased the plot of land to build the Blue Dragon Manor, he had bought an extremely large area. Even if a thousand people were to stay there, the manor wouldn’t feel cramped at all. However, even after Huang Xiaolong counted the Eminent Elders, who ran all the way over from the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate, there were probably only several dozen people staying in the manor.

“Xiaolong, we should really hire more people,” Feng Tianyu continued.

“Alright. I shall ask Grand Hall Master Wu Ge to send over several guards.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and agreed.

Even though Wu Ge’s disciple, Xie Yao, held a ton of hatred for Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong felt that Wu Ge was still an extremely reliable person.

As the Grand Hall Master of the Holy Heavens, Wu Ge had definitely gained the approval of all four Primal Ancestors.

“Is there still no news from the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate?” Huang Xiaolong changed the topic immediately.

Even though he was busy getting ready for the opening of the Cangqiong Holy Manor, he had never forgotten about the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

When he had accepted the missions to kill the disciples of the evil faction in the Profound River, he was getting back at them for the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate!

“The Zhuoyuan Holy Gate is currently controlled by the Jiang Family,” Li Wen growled. “Right now, the Jiang Family, under Jiang Tian’s lead, threw themselves and the Holy Gate under the umbrella of the Devil Palace. It’s even said that Jiang Tian is currently serving as one of the trusted aides under Dou Rui.”

Li Wen and Chen Shiming couldn’t help but feel their vision turning red when they spoke about Jiang Tian.

Frosty light flashed through Di Huai’s eyes when he heard Jiang Tian’s name.

“Hold it in for a little while more. When I’m done with the Cangqiong Holy Manor, I’ll make a trip back to the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground,” Huang Xiaolong growled, “I’ll let Jiang Tian live for a little while longer.”

After returning, he would settle the new hatred formed along with the old scores he had.

“Xiaolong, it’s a little too dangerous for you to return. After all, the experts of the Devil Palace are crawling all over the place.” Di Huai explained, “Jiang Tian can’t stay cooped up in the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate forever. It won’t be too late to kill him when he leaves.”

“That’s right. The Devil Palace sent a ton of experts over to the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground in order to lay down a trap for you,” Li Wen hastily added, “Even though Jiang Tian seems to be in control of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate, the experts of the Devil Palace are the ones controlling the place behind the scene.

Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and the others quickly tried to dissuade him.

Huang Xiaolong knew that they were all worried about his safety, and warmth started to spread through his heart. “Relax. I know my limits.” Even if the experts of the Devil Palace were stationed in the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate, they were mostly low-leveled True Saints. He wasn’t worried about low-leveled True Saints with the Winged Dragon Flying Ship.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong tried to find out from Li Wen the true strength of the experts sent to the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate. According to what Li Wen knew, the strongest expert they had was a First Heaven True Saint. As for his exact realm, no one knew about that.

Huang Xiaolong relaxed when he learned of the other party’s strength.

“Xiaolong, I heard that you made a bet with Li Chen and the others.” Feng Tianyu shifted the topic all of a sudden.

Di Huai and the others immediately turned serious.

Huang Xiaolong noticed the weird look on their faces and a chuckle left his lips. “What? Do you guys believe that I won’t be able to qualify?”

Di Huai was the first to speak up, “According to the news circulating out there, even Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints won’t be able to qualify.”

It was clear that only True Saints had the ability to guarantee their spot in the top three hundred.

Even though Di Huai, Zhang Wenyue, and the others had complete confidence in Huang Xiaolong, they couldn’t help but doubt his ability when it came to the Trial of Blood.

Di Huai felt a little ashamed when he spoke about the bet. Deep down in his heart, he knew that Huang Xiaolong had only made the bet to get rid of Fu Yunjie.

In the end, everything Huang Xiaolong did was because of the hatred between Di Huai and Fu Yunjie’s master from the past.

Huang Xiaolong laughed and dismissed their concerns, “Lord Di Huai, I wouldn’t have agreed if I wasn’t confident in passing.”

As soon as the words left his lips, they stared at him with a complicated expression. It was clear that none of them believed him.

“Xiaolong, why don’t you ask your masters to order Li Chen and the others to back down?” Di Huai asked slowly.

Huang Xiaolong refused immediately by shaking his head. “The news had already spread through the city. Many Holy Gates have learned of the bet. It’s impossible for us to cancel it now. That’s also the reason Li Chen, Xie Yao, and the others chose to spread the news.”

Night eventually fell and darkness covered the lands.

In Huang Xiaolong’s personal courtyard, he retrieved a single pill. The moment it was revealed to the world, starlight fell upon the courtyard and sparkling lights flashed in his surroundings.

The pill he took out was precisely the Star Transferring Holy Pill the Heavenly Master had received from the others in the day.

One had to know that Huang Xiaolong had forty stalks of holy herbs on him. In order to prevent Huang Xiaolong from wasting any more of them, the Heavenly Master had used four Star Transferring Holy Pills to trade them away.

Compared to the unrefined holy herbs, the four Star Transferring Holy Pills were much more valuable.

As such, Huang Xiaolong had managed to benefit from the trade.

However, his plan was to enter the Devil Cave to evolve his saint attributes. When he was done, he would return to absorb the four pills. Moreover, he hadn’t refined the pill Palace Master Xue Lingyun had gaven him during the apprenticeship ceremony. He planned to refine them all after returning from the Devil Cave.

When dawn broke the next day, Huang Xiaolong contacted Grand Hall Master Wu Ge and arranged for him to send over a hundred guards. Among them, there would be fifty male guards and fifty female guards. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wu Ge didn’t hesitate and he personally led them over after a few days. When he met with Huang Xiaolong, he even mentioned that he had severely berated his disciple over the bet he made.

Huang Xiaolong merely shook his hands to indicate that it was alright. He reassured Wu Ge before sending him off.

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

After Huang Xiaolong arranged the matters in the Blue Dragon Manor, he left for the Devil Cave.

When he arrived, Elder Zhang Sijin was waiting for him. He rushed over and greeted Huang Xiaolong immediately.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong arrived, Xie Yao and the others received a report from their subordinates.

“Cultivating in the Devil Cave again? Does he think that cultivating in the Devil Cave will aid him in the Trial of Blood?” Chen Kaiping sneered. “He’s too naive. How strong do you guys think he’ll be when the trial starts?”

Xie Yao snorted in contempt. “He should probably be able to enter the Eighth Order Venerable Realm by the time the trial starts.” The hatred he had for Huang Xiaolong had increased once again after he was scolded by his master.
