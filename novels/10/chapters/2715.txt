Chapter 2716: Three Beauties of the Clear Snow Palace, Captured!

Just as Huang Xiaolong and the others were speeding towards the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds, the three high-level Primal Ancestors sat in the seat of Lord Long and the others in the main hall of the Holy Heavens.

The True Saints who submitted to their rule could be seen kneeling in the main hall.

The palace master of the Devil Palace, Qiao Jinyang, could be seen at the front of the hall in front of Cao Nan and Gu Tian. After all, they were Primal Ancestors, and there was no need for them to kneel.

Unlike the other Primal Ancestors, those from the Devil Palace found no need to escape. Instead, they immediately submitted to their opponent’s rule.

According to Qiao Jinyang, they were merely submitting in the face of greater power. As the saying goes, if you can’t beat them, join them.

“Lord Chi Dao, reports came in from those at the ancient battlefield. The Heavenly Master and the others are back, and they are currently heading towards us.” Qiao Jinyang bowed respectfully to the Primal Ancestor with the horn, and he bowed.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

His reverence wasn’t fake. After all, the horned expert was even stronger than the Cangqiong Old Man, and Qiao Jinyang was fearful of the other party’s strength.

“Huang Xiaolong is also present,” Qiao Jinyang hesitated for a moment, and he continued his report. His emotions were extremely complicated when he mentioned Huang Xiaolong.

After all, Huang Xiaolong was the reason for his sorry experience.

“Is he the one who has three aaint godheads that can evolve? Is he the disciple of those weaklings from the Holy Heavens?” The lion-bodied man sneered. “Perfect. We can deal with all of them at once.”

In the past, Chi Dao, Liu Wuji, and the other high-level Primal Ancestor had chased Tyrant Chu and the others to the Otherworldly Mansion. They were stopped by Duan Feng and were forced to retreat. They had entered seclusion in order to recover to their peak state, and they had failed to get anyone to gather intelligence in the Alien Lands. They had no idea what Huang Xiaolong was capable of, and the legends he created outside the Holy World. All they knew was his past achievements.

Naturally, they didn’t look highly upon his strength.

The old man with red skin finally revealed his face and a solitary eye could be seen sitting in his eye sockets. He turned to Chi Dao and harrumphed, “Huang Xiaolong is indeed a talent. Who would have thought that a tiny place like this could produce such a talent? Hehe, Even our Chaos Essence Holy World doesn’t possess such a genius.”

“Talent is useless if you’re dead. When he returns, we’ll see that this talent disappears from the universe. When he left the Holy World, he was able to challenge First Resurrection Primal Ancestors, but no matter how strong he is, he should only be comparable to a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor now.”

Even though Huang Xiaolong could cultivate quickly with his three evolving saint godheads, they felt that no matter how talented the other party was, there was no way he could compare to a mid-level Primal Ancestor. At the very best, he should be able to challenge Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestors!

“However, all of them should be here to take revenge.” Liu Wuji sneered, “Could they have brought Duan Feng with them?”

The three of them looked at Qiao Jinyang.

“This… This subordinate hasn’t been able to receive news about that. However, he has to be here. Otherwise, the Heavenly Master and the others will never dare to return.”

“Could his injuries have healed?!” The one-eyed expert frowned.

Chi Dao sneered coldly in response. “It’s good that he’s here. He won’t be breathing when I’m done with him!”

“I wonder if that little lass, Xue Lingyun, came back with them.” A weird light flashed in Liu Wuji’s eyes when he thought about her.

Cao Nan started laughing all of a sudden. “Reporting to Lord Liu Wuji, we received news that Xue Lingyun is traveling with them.”

“Hehe, I allowed her to escape previously… This time, she’s mine!”

Out of the three of them, he was the only one interested in her.

A chuckle left Cao Nan’s lips. “There’s another piece of good news. The men I sent out reported that they located the whereabouts of the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace. The three of them are currently hiding in the Cleansing River Holy Grounds!”

Liu Wuji roared with laughter when he heard the news. “Wahahaha! It really is good news! Pass down my order! You are to capture them at all costs. Also, you can’t injure them in the slightest! When you bring them back, I’ll shower them with my love!” When he thought of how he could obtain the services of Xue Lingyun and three of her disciples, he felt extremely excited.

Cao Nan bowed respectfully and reassured Liu Wuji, “Lord Wuji, you can rest assured that we’ll bring them back. In fact, I’ll head over personally to capture the three of them.”

Liu Wuji nodded in satisfaction. “Alright! Go and bring them back to me! I’ll reward you heavily. I’ll even teach you a grand dao art from the Chaos Essence Holy World!”

“Go! Bring them back! They had better not escape this time. If you fail to bring them back, you shall face the consequences!”

Cao Nan was elated when he heard what Liu Wuji said at first, but his heart trembled when he heard of what would happen if he failed. “Lord Wuji, I will definitely bring them back!”

Bowing respectfully, he left the hall.

However, he was furious to discover that the three of them had left the Cleansing River Holy Grounds when he arrived.

The disciples in charge of monitoring their movements were killed by Cao Nan in a fit of rage.

When the others who followed him oversaw what happened, they felt a chill running down their hearts.

“Lord Cao Nan, the three of them couldn’t have gotten far! I used a secret art to look for traces of them a moment ago, and their aura can still be seen in the area! They should have left less than half a day ago!” someone reported to Cao Nan all of a sudden.

Finally calming down, Cao Nan ordered, “Everyone, move out and capture the three of them! If you fail to do so, I’ll kill everyone present!”

Bowing in acknowledgment, everyone left to search for the three ladies.

After several hours…

To Cao Nan’s delight, he saw three beauties fleeing in panic before his very eyes.

As for the three of them, despair filled their eyes when they noticed the giant group of pursuers led by Cao Nan.

“Xiaoying, Xinyi, both of you run as fast as you can. I’ll stay behind and hold them back,” Tan Juan spoke all of a sudden.

“Run? Do you think that you’ll be able to escape from me?!” Cao Nan’s figure flashed, and he appeared before them in an instant.

With their jaws dropping in shock, the three ladies felt the flames of hope in their hearts flying out.

“The three of you had better give yourselves up. In fact, the heavens has given you a chance to follow Lord Liu Wuji and be his companions. You’ll be able to enjoy limitless resources and there’s nothing better than that! Whatever the case, you’ll get more than when you were disciples of Xue Lingyun! Oh right, there’s something else I need to tell you. Your master is currently coming back to the Holy World together with Huang Xiaolong.”

“What?!” Lin Xiaoying and the other two exclaimed in surprise.

However, a cold sneer left Cao Nan’s lips. “Do you really think that Huang Xiaolong can save you? The three lords have already moved to intercept them. All of them will die! I’m only telling you this so that you will follow Lord Wuji obediently in the future! When you rise to power in the future beside him, you have to remember your debt of gratitude to this old man for bringing you back! Hahaha!”

Without allowing them to speak, Cao Nan captured them immediately.

Even though they were all True Saints, they were helpless when facing a Primal Ancestor like Cao Nan. After all, not everyone had Huang Xiaolong’s ridiculous strength.

After taking the three of them down, Cao Nan turned around and chuckled, “We’ll return right now! We should be in time to watch how Lord Wuji slays Huang Xiaolong, that little mongrel b*stard!”
