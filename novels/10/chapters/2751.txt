Chapter 2752: Tang Long Resolved

Chaotic space currents surged everywhere, akin to a descending torrential river, smashing everything into smithereens.

Cangqiong City quaked violently, and not only Cangqiong City, but violent tremors traveled across the entire Cangqiong Sacred Land, causing ruptures and broken lands.

Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciples within the city were terrified.

“Ninety-two Primal Ancestors’ combined attack is really terrifying!” Those who had chosen not to interfere in the battle like Zhu Xu sighed endlessly at this sight. “If this attack hits, even a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor would be left with half a life!”

Zhu Xu, and everyone else were awed by the magnitude of the attack, including Cangqiong Old Man, Mo Zhi, Fei Yanzi and the rest.

On the other hand, Duan Feng and Long Jianfei were more composed than the others. When they were at the Divination Creed and the Dragon Fish Creed, they had seen this kind of scene many times. Forget about seeing just ninety-two Primal Ancestors attacking simultaneously, but they had even seen more than a hundred Primal Ancestors’ simultaneous attack.

BOOM!

Almost in an instant, Tang Long’s Tang Dragon Blade and Han Mo’s Freezing Desert Mountain landed on Huang Xiaolong at the same time. A split second later, Chu Yifan and the rest experts’ attacks also landed accurately on Huang Xiaolong.

Space continued to shatter and there were glaring rays of light in every direction, blinding the spectating experts. Even experts like Zhu Xu could not open their eyes to see what was going on.

Some time later, everyone finally regained their sights.

The violent and chaotic space currents were still blasting in the air.

An abyssal space black hole appeared where Huang Xiaolong had stood originally, with a terrifying suction force spewing outwards.

Faces ashened when they felt the powerful suction and tearing force from the space black hole.

This degree of suction and tearing force could tear a Seventh Resurrection, or even an Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor into pieces.

“Huang Xiaolong is probably dead, right?” Ren Yifei asked.

All eyes were staring fixedly on the same spot, but they were also observing the surroundings, searching for a trace of Huang Xiaolong. Unfortunately, there wasn’t even a shadow of Huang Xiaolong in the entire Cangqiong City, and not just that, but also in a hundred million miles radius from Cangqiong City’s four directions.

The various forces’ experts exchanged looks with their companions as they had the same thought. Is Huang Xiaolong dead?

Zhu Xu’s eyes searched all around with his brows creased into deep furrows.

In the case of an average Ninth Heaven True Saint, that attack from now would have absolutely destroyed him, but Huang Xiaolong was not some average Ninth Heaven True Saint. Based on Huang Xiaolong’s current physique, it was impossible for him to be destroyed until not a piece of flesh remained.

Cangqiong Old Man, who was quite confident of Huang Xiaolong, paled when he couldn’t sense Huang Xiaolong’s presence for a long time, and he finally began to panic.

“Xiaolong!” Cangqiong Old Man cried out.

But no one responded to Cangqiong Old Man.

Mo Zhi, Long Shengtian, Fei Yanzi, and Zi Dongping also began to feel flustered, but only Long Jianfei and Duan Feng looked as calm as ever.

Tang Long, Han Mo, and others expanded their dao souls’ senses trying to locate Huang Xiaolong, but after scanning a hundred million miles radius in the four directions, all of them were surprised as there was no trace of Huang Xiaolong at all.

“Master, it looks like Huang Xiaolong’s really dead!” One of the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s experts laughed. “With ninety-two of us bombarding him, no matter how strong Huang Xiaolong’s body was, he’s dead for sure!”

Tang Long and Han Mo exchanged a glance. Is Huang Xiaolong really dead? Although neither of them believed so, how could they explain the disappearance of Huang Xiaolong’s aura?

“Look!” someone suddenly shouted.

Both Tang Long and Han Mo stiffened and their heads jerked towards the said direction. A pair of hands suddenly reached out from within the abyssal black hole space that was in the same spot where Huang Xiaolong had been standing when he was attacked.

A pair of hands is actually ripping apart the healing space!

All around were agape faces as they watched this scene. Obviously, they had never seen this level of method before.

After the space black hole expanded, a figure stepped out as if walking out of a room.

“Huang, Huang Xiaolong!” someone shrieked.

The figure stepping out from the space black hole was none other than Huang Xiaolong.

Tang Long, Han Mo, Chu Yifan, and the others’ faces turned unpleasant.

“Huang Xiaolong is too terrifying!”’ A sacred land’s expert quivered.

He still came out leisurely after being swallowed by a space black hole! Unharmed, totally unscathed!

Divine Tuo World’s suction and tearing force were extremely overbearing. Apart from Dao Venerables, once someone was sucked inside, they could only wait for death to arrive.

Yet, Huang Xiaolong, a mere True Saint, had walked out safely.

Compared to Tang Long and the others’ unpleasant faces, Cangqiong Old Man, Wang Xueru, and the others were ecstatic that Huang Xiaolong was alright.

After stepping out from the space black hole, Huang Xiaolong himself was inwardly relieved. He had been a little careless. He had intended to test how sturdy his physical body was by taking on Tang Long and the others’ attacks, but he hadn’t expected the surrounding space to shatter instead. If it hadn’t been for the small world inside of his body, he really might not have walked out alive.

If he had failed to walk out, then his end would have been floating forever in the black hole space, unless he would have met with a space crack like Long Jianfei.

“Kill!” Tang Long roared as he snapped out of his shock. Every strand of grand energy in his body was pushed to the extreme, and the Tang Dragon Blade in his hand once again swung down on Huang Xiaolong.

Han Mo threw the Freezing Desert Mountain at Huang Xiaolong, once again showering meteors down on Huang Xiaolong, reaching Huang Xiaolong faster than the eye could blink. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Chu Yifan and the others swiftly launched another wave of attack.

After seeing that their first attack had failed to hurt Huang Xiaolong, Tang Long and the others attacked with full force this time around. This combined attack was definitely several notches stronger than before.

Space shattered once again.

However, this time…

A cold light gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as both the Cangqiong Blade and Flying Heaven Spear appeared in his hands at the same time. In a flicker, he avoided Tang Long’s and Han Mo’s attacks, andhe reached them in the next moment.

The Cangqiong Blade and Flying Heaven Spear struck out simultaneously.

A streak of blade-ray and spear-light flashed across the air at the same time.

Then, everyone saw Tang Long’s and Han Mo’s heads drawing arches across the sky.

When Tang Long’s head flew, his body plummeted to the ground and split into two, whereas Han Mo’s forehead spurted golden-colored blood.

Huang Xiaolong continued to move as he struck seamlessly with the blade and the spear in his hands. With every strike of each weapon, two people were sent flying, or blood spurted into the air. Worst of all, some people directly exploded to their deaths.

Two, four, six, eight, ten…, Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Chufan Sacred Land continued to lose their experts at twice the speed, including Chu Yifan and the twenty-plus Primal Ancestors who had joined later on.

Soon after, only Huang Xiaolong remained standing in the air. Cangqiong Sacred Land’s ground was dyed with golden blood. Tang Long, Han Mo, Chu Yifan, and many other experts’ bodies were sprawled everywhere, including the mountain peaks, rivers, muddy puddles, and forests.

“This… Is everything settled?” Zhu Xu and the others couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

The Tang Dragon Blade, the Freezing Desert Mountain, and various other dao artifacts were scattered on the ground, but no one dared to pick them up.

At this time, three sources of light soared to the sky.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, reaching out to grab with his hand, and all these three sources of light fell into his palm. These were Tang Long’s, Han Mo’s, and Chu Yifan’s dao souls.
