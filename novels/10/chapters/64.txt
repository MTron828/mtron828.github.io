Chapter 65: Return to the Royal City

“Who exactly are you?” Wu Gan was frightened as he looked at the approaching Huang Xiaolong and he blurted out the question.

“Who I am is not important,” said Huang Xiaolong as he kept walking closer, pressuring the other man as he moved forward with an indifferent expression. In Huang Xiaolong’s opinion, who he was truly wasn’t important because he and this person would not meet each other again.

Wu Gan detected the killing intent in Huang Xiaolong’s words and Wu Gan abruptly turned around and his body became like the wind, already escaping towards the entrance of the cave tunnel.

But, he had just gotten there when a figure blocked his path. In front of him, a burst of a fierce aura swirled towards Wu Gan, making him retreat in fright.

Retreating to his original spot, he saw that it was actually the little monkey who had blocked his path!

Seeing the person retreat to the original spot, the little violet monkey grinned and squeaked, making Huang Xiaolong smile. This Nine Phoenix Valley disciple might not have understood what the little monkey said, but Huang Xiaolong did: the little guy was basically saying– you want to run, you must first ask, I, your Monkey Father’s claws first.

Although Wu Gan can’t understand the little violet monkey, the mockery in the blue pupils needed no explanation. Furious at being made fun of by a little animal, Wu Gan fully released his battle qi and summoned his martial spirit.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised; this Wu Gan’s martial spirit was a toad type demonic beast, but the only difference was, this martial spirit had a tail at its end.

“What kind of martial spirit is this?”

Although Huang Xiaolong had read a lot of books relating to martial spirits in the Cosmic Star Academy, he still wasn’t able to recognize this martial spirit. However, in the Martial Spirit World, martial spirits exist in countless forms and there were also many variational martial spirits such that even a Saint level warrior who had a thousand year lifespan wouldn’t necessarily know either.

After summoning his martial spirit, Wu Gan suddenly swung his sword towards the little violet monkey.

“Sunset on the Long River!”

Sword rays shot forward as if sinking down into the ground and, while the sword rays looked gentle, they contained an endless murderous aura.

When the little violet monkey saw the attack, he grinned and, instead of retreating, it leaped forward and both of its sharp claws struck out. Claw prints overlapped and space fluctuated.

Huang Xiaolong stood there, he had no inclination of joining the fight. He could see that the Nine Phoenix Valley’s disciple hadn’t yet advanced to the Seventh Order; since he had not advanced into the Seventh Order warrior, then the little guy could handle it on its own.

And it proved to be true when a short while later, the little violet monkey’s claws turned Wu Gan’s chest into ribbons, blood spurting out instantly.

Looking at the claw marks on his chest, Wu Gan was shocked and angry at the same time.

Without wasting a moment, the little violet monkey rushed up again.

“Animal, you are looking for death!” Wu Gan swung his sword in anger and the sword rays looked like a rotating sun, shining brightly and forcing the little violet monkey to retreat a step back. Then, Wu Gan flashed and once again tried to escape from the cave opening. But, how could Huang Xiaolong who was watching all this at the side allow Wu Gan to run away? With a shift of his body, Huang Xiaolong was already blocking the path of the escapee.

“F*ck off!” Wu Gan roared at the top of his lungs and his sword struck out with anxiety.

Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at the other party and the Blades of Asura appeared in his palms as his icy-cold voice sounded, “Tears of Asura!” He leaped up and the blades slashed down.

Before Wu Gan’s frightened and frantic eyes, many, many blade rays appeared and turned into a violent, thunderous rainstorm that stretched sixty meters wide and enveloped him.

Huang Xiaolong landed back on the ground and retrieved the Blades of Asura into his arms.

The rays of blade light dissipated and so did the angry thunderstorm. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Wu Gan fell to the floor, his eyes still showed emotions such as fear, despair, and dismay. From head to toe, Wu Gan was covered with blood-filled holes, which looked like it was penetrated by drops of sharp rain.

Pierced through by over a hundred holes, it was a horrible way of dying.

On the ground, from Wu Gan’s body suddenly came the cry of an Asura, lasting only for a single moment before it vanished.

Watching his opponents expressions of fear, despair, and dismay, Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice rang out, “Indeed, the Cycad fruit’s taste was quite good, too bad you have no chance to taste it.”

Wu Gan stopped moving.

The truth was, even if the two of them hadn’t planned on silencing him, he still wouldn’t have let them leave the place alive.

Just as both young men had said earlier, the underground cycad tree was a secret that could not be allowed to leak out.

Although a cycad fruit was incomparable to the Yang fruit Huang Xiaolong had taken years before, this still was a cycad tree that could bear more than a hundred cycad fruits every year!

This made the value of this cycad tree much higher than the Yang fruit!

With this cycad tree, in the future, Huang Xiaolong could come back here to cultivate two months every year. More importantly, with these cycad fruits, his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, had the possibility to advance further in their cultivation. Also, his little sister Huang Min’s martial spirit was going to be awakened soon and these cycad fruits could help to lay a better foundation for her.

Of course, not to mention his little brother, Huang Xiaohai, too.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong cleaned up the area and dealt with the bodies– on the two bodies, he ‘found’ some gold coins, a Battle Qi Dan, and a book called the Treasure Mirror.

Flipping through the book, Huang Xiaolong found that it wasn’t some cultivation technique or battle skill manual, but a book introducing a variety of the world’s rare and wondrous treasures, the places they might grow, their uses and benefits.

Of course, the book just introduced and mentioned possible places these rare treasures could be found, but they were just possibilities. It still required individuals to actually go and search for it.

After he took care of the two corpses, Xiaolong picked all of the cycad fruits from the tree and placed them in the Asura Ring before leaving the underground cave with the little violet monkey and venturing deeper into the Silvermoon Forest.

More than a month had passed since the underground cave incident.

Somewhere in the Silvermoon Forest near a lake. The green water of the lake made people feel relaxed and there was a naked boy swimming in it. The boy was, of course, Huang Xiaolong.

Although only ten years old, his body was already well-proportioned and muscular. And in these four months, he had grown taller again, a little over five feet tall.

Suddenly, a little monkey head emerged from the water. The little violet monkey emerged from the water and it gave a squeak as its hands splashed water in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

Huang Xiaolong laughed wickedly, his body twirled to the side avoiding the water attack and his palm hit the water.

One man and one monkey were playing in the lake.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey swam to the shore, dried up, and he put his clothes back on.

It’s been more than four months, time to go back! Huang Xiaolong thought to himself– he had just enough time to rush back to the Luo Tong Kingdom’s Royal City to participate in the Academy’s year-end competition.

After four months of grinding in the Silvermoon Forest, Huang Xiaolong had reached peak mid-Sixth Order and could break through to the late-Sixth Order at any time.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey journeyed back in the direction of the Royal City.

Ten days later, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey appeared before the Luo Tong Royal City’s huge city gates. Looking at the words stating ‘Luo Tong Royal City’ there was an indescribable feeling in his heart.

Luo Tong Royal City, I’m back!

Passing the gates into the city, the back of one man and one monkey gradually disappeared from view.

However, Huang Xiaolong went straight to Cosmic Star Academy instead of returning to the Tianxuan Mansion.
