Chapter 2318: What?! Fully Attributed?!

As the night slowly passed, Huang Xiaolong activated the Holy Mandate Imprint and continued to cultivate.

Traces of source energy from the Holy World streamed down from the void and entered Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Purple dragons soared around him, and they grew stronger with every strand of energy Huang Xiaolong absorbed.

After leaving Emperor Yu Holy Grounds, Huang Xiaolong experienced breakthrough after breakthrough. Now, he was already at the peak of the early-Third Order Venerable Realm. He was merely half a step away from reaching the mid-Third Order Venerable Realm.

Despite his speed of improvement, Huang Xiaolong still felt that it was a little too slow for his liking.

Even though he was a Third Order Venerable, he was as weak as a newborn chick when compared to those in the Holy Heavens!

A mid-Third Order Venerable was a peak existence in the dynasties of several holy grounds, but it placed him at the bottom of the strength pyramid in the Holy Heavens!

As Huang Xiaolong cultivated peacefully in his courtyard, Xiao Fuwen, who had conducted the test earlier in the day, made a report to a vice hall master of the organization. The vice hall master was called Du Cheng, and he was someone with some authority in the organization. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Hearing Xiao Fuwen’s report, a smile appeared on his face. “After three hundred thousand years, we finally managed to discover a disciple with astounding talent!”

Naturally, he was referring to Fu Yunjie.

Xiao Fuwen chuckled, “That’s right. It’s been too long since we discovered a disciple like Fu Yunjie!”

Du Cheng nodded. “Report to me immediately after the test tomorrow! I want a detailed report on him!”

“Vice Hall Master Du can rest assured.” Xiao Fuwen acknowledged. “I will definitely make a proper report after Fu Yunjie takes the second test!”

However, he couldn’t help but think of Huang Xiaolong after he spoke about Fu Yunjie’s results. After a short moment of hesitation, he spoke, “Vice Hall Master, there’s something else I need to say. There’s a disciple called Huang Xiaolong from the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate, and his situation is rather special....”

Du Cheng chuckled. “I’ve heard of him. He’s the one with the Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Saint Godhead, right? It’s indeed special that someone with barely any talent like him would register to join the Holy Heavens.”

Du Cheng had naturally heard of Huang Xiaolong with the number of rumors flying around in the city.

Those who spoke of Fu Yunjie would usually talk about Huang Xiaolong, and that was where he had obtained his information.

A stunned expression appeared on Xiao Fuwen’s face, and he continued, “Hahaha, I didn’t expect that a disciple with saint attributes ranking in the nine hundreds would dare to apply.” He paused for a second before continuing, “However, his situation is indeed special.”

“Explain.” Du Cheng couldn’t help but laugh when he saw the importance Xiao Fuwen placed on it.

“His saint godhead are fully attributed!”

“WHAT?” A complicated light flashed in Du Cheng’s eyes. “What did you just say?! How can his Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Saint Godhead be fully attributed?!”

Xiao Fuwen was taken aback when he saw the animated expression on Du Cheng’s face.

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes were fully attributed, they ranked in the nine hundreds! Is there a need to make such a fuss?

Is there something he didn’t know?!

Du Cheng turned around all of a sudden and snapped, “Why didn’t you make the report earlier?!”

Xiao Fuwen opened his mouth, but no sound came out. What’s going on?!

?!?!?!?!?!?!

In fact, if he hadn’t seen a disciple with a fully attributed saint godhead, he would have skipped to report on Huang Xiaolong altogether.

Du Cheng looked at the wronged expression on Xiao Fuwen’s face and consoled him, “I can’t blame you for this.... It’s a secret of the highest level in our organization....”

“Secret of the highest level?!” Xiao Fuwen stared at Du Cheng in shock.

Aren’t they going overboard with this?

“Oh yeah, Vice Hall Master Du, Huang Xiaolong’s saint bloodline and saint physique are both fully attributed.” Not willing to miss out the slightest detail, Xiao Fuwen added.

“WHAT?!?!?!” The blood drained from Du Cheng’s face, and he screamed. “All of his saint attributes are fully attributed?!”

“Yes... yes....” Xiao Fuwen hesitated for a second and he replied. He dug through his memories of the day and mentioned everything to Du Cheng without missing a single detail.

Exhaling a long breath, Du Cheng replied, “Alright. You can leave now.”

“Yes!”

“Oh right, wait a minute.” Just as Xiao Fuwen was about to leave, Du Cheng’s voice rang in his mind. “If Huang Xiaolong registers to take the second test, you have to report to me right away! Not a moment’s delay! Do you understand me?!”

Xiao Fuwen nodded his head, and he looked like a chicken pecking on rice.

As soon as he left, Du Cheng tore through the air and shot towards the headquarters. He knew that he had to make a report to the Grand Hall Master, Wu Ge!

Light rained down on the lands as dawn broke the next day. The city rose to life as the streets bustled with activity.

The experts in the city swarmed towards the Heavenly Master’s Manor.

A bridge stood strong in the northern region of the manor, and it was precisely the location of the second test.

There were twelve sacred steles located on the Holy Bridge, and one would pass as long as they comprehended six of them.

When Huang Xiaolong and Di Huai arrived, there was already a massive crowd around the bridge.

Huang Xiaolong remained completely indifferent as he swept his gaze across everyone present. Ordinarily, no one would bother watching the selection process, but today, everyone had come to watch Fu Yunjie’s test!

Fu Yunjie and Fan Xia emerged from the crowd and approached the bridge.

Feng Yuanyuan could be seen following behind them, and she was conversing happily with Fu Yunjie. It seemed as though they were a couple matched in heaven.

“Hehe! Huang Xiaolong, who gave you the guts to take the second test?” Fu Yunjie noticed Huang Xiaolong from the corner of his eye and the smile on his face became even brighter.

As soon as the words left his lips, everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong.

With an indifferent expression, Huang Xiaolong ignored the mockery directed at him as he approached the bridge with Di Huai beside him. After registering to take the test, he paid another hundred million holy bills.

After accepting the examination slip, he waited at the side. The number on his slip was eighteen, and the tenth participant was currently taking the test.

Looking at Fu Yunjie’s slip, Huang Xiaolong noticed that it was the eleventh slip.
