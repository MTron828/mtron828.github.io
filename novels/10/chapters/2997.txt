Chapter 2998: One Finger

Like the present grand ancestors, Ao He stared at Huang Xiaolong as though he was staring at some dumb*ss beggar asking to meet the emperor of a kingdom at the gates of the imperial palace.

When he finally processed what Huang Xiaolong said, he roared with laughter. “What did you just say? Do you plan on retrieving the Blood Dragon Stele from our Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor? Are you sure your brain is working fine? Do you really think you can barge into our Holy Dragon Race and mess around with that Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm beast by your side?!”

The grand ancestors of the Holy Dragon Race glared at Huang Xiaolong.

“Brat, I don’t know which creed you come from, but if you think that you can do as you wish in our Holy Dragon World, then you’re wrong,” Ao Linhai growled.

Casually tracing the dao lines on the Tortoise Ancestor’s shell, Huang Xiaolong replied placidly, “Your Holy Dragon Race isn’t really worth my time. If not because you obtained the Blood Dragon Stele, I wouldn’t be here. The Blood Dragon Stele belongs to my family, and I’m here to get it back. None of you here have the power to make the decision to hand over the stele to me anyway, and you should just call your Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor out.”

Ao He’s expression fell as frosty light flashed through his eyes. “Since you’re here to look for trouble, there’s no need for you to leave! The Radiant Winged Dragon Race can remain where they are. I’ll kill you on their behalf!” Dragon qi filled the area as a massive dragon appeared behind Ao He.

Dragon runes could be seen flashing on the body of the giant dragon behind him, and it looked similar to the true body of the Holy Dragon itself.

The core disciples of the Holy Dragon Race looked at the body of the Holy Dragon behind Ao He and gasped in shock. The Holy Dragon they could summon was several tens of thousands of feet long, but the one behind Ao He was several hundred thousand feet long! As it hovered in the air above the city, everyone in the city noticed its majestic presence. The disciples of the Holy Dragon Race felt their jaws dropping in shock.

“Which expert from the race summoned the Holy Dragon?!”

“This seems like Young Patriarch Ao He’s power! I wonder who angered the young master! If he makes his move, the entire Holy Dragon World will tremble!”

Ao He of the Holy Dragon Race was the strongest individual in the younger generation of the Holy Dragon World, and he was in line to become the Holy Dragon Patriarch in the future! He wouldn’t move against someone unless something big happened, and now that he had summoned the Holy Dragon, everyone knew that whatever happened would be something that would shake the Holy Dragon World.

Staring at the giant dragon behind Ao He, Huang Xiaolong remained expressionless. He clasped his hands behind his back and looked completely unaffected. If this was before he entered the Blue Lotus Pond, he might have been a little cautious when dealing with the Holy Dragon Race. However, after his harvest there, he wouldn’t be afraid of anyone in the Divine Tuo Holy World, much less the Holy Dragon World! Even if everyone in the Holy Dragon World decided to work together, he could kill them all the same!

If Ao He really planned on making a move against him…

Hehe.

A chilly light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Right before Ao He could do anything, a figure tore through the air to arrive before him.

“Brother Ao He, please stay your hand!” An elegant voice rang in the ears of everyone present.

The experts of the Holy Dragon Race stared at the newcomer and realized that Feng Nana and the experts of the Heavenly Phoenix Race had arrived.

“I see that Nana has arrived…” A smile formed on Ao He’s face when he saw Feng Nana.

The Holy Dragon Race had always been on friendly terms with the Heavenly Phoenix Race, and as the young patriarchs of their respective races, the relationship between the two was exceptional.

Feng Nana chuckled softly when she spoke to Ao He, “Big Brother Ao He, it’s been a long time since we last met! Who would have thought that you would enter the Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm before me!”

Several years ago, Ao He’s breakthrough had alarmed the Divine Tuo Holy World as many genesis races had turned their attention to the Holy Dragon World.

Ao He laughed softly, “It’s never too late to accept your congratulations.”

Their chatter quickly overshadowed Huang Xiaolong, who was standing at the side quietly.

After they were finally done, Feng Nana turned to glare at Huang Xiaolong. “Big Brother Ao He, is he the man who killed Feng Xue?”

Ao He nodded slowly. “That's him. I was planning on capturing him before sending him over to you. Who would have thought that you would arrive before I could make my move?”

“Big Brother Ao He, I would like to avenge Feng Xue with my own hands.” Feng Nana growled, “Please allow me to do so.”

Ao He chuckled and stepped to the side elegantly. “Of course!” He didn’t plan to interfere now that the members of the Heavenly Phoenix Race had arrived. The grand ancestors of the Heavenly Phoenix Race locked their auras onto the Tortoise Ancestor at the side, and if he dared to make a move, they would pounce on him instantly.

Feng Nana glared at Huang Xiaolong, and she sneered, “Make your move. Don’t even dream of getting any assistance from your stupid tortoise.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A look of amusement flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he heard what she said. “There’s only one outcome if you plan to move against me. You will end up like Feng Xue! You might have brought a lot of experts along with you, but none of them will be able to save you!”

Ao He and the grand ancestors of the Holy Dragon Race frowned when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“Brat, how dare you?!” Feng Chengtai roared in anger. The patriarch of the Heavenly Phoenix Race might have been on his way, but Feng Chengtai was a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable. There were three late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables from the Heavenly Phoenix Race present, and he was one of them. There was also Ao Linhai and Ao Xin of the Holy Dragon Race standing beside them, ready to lend their assistance at any time!

With five Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables surrounding Huang Xiaolong, they couldn’t believe how arrogant he was acting!

Ao He snorted in disdain, “If I didn’t promise Nana not to interfere in the battle, I would have killed you with a single slap!”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t angered by his threat at all. After all, why would anyone be frustrated when ants threatened them? “I was planning to leave after obtaining the Blood Dragon Stele and dealing with the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Ancestor. But now, not even the Dark Lightning Old Dragon can save your lives.”

“All of you should come at me together. There’s no need for me to deal with you one by one.”

“I alone, am enough!” Feng Nana roared in anger when she realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t taking her seriously. The Heavenly Phoenix Sword appeared in her hand, and she poured her cosmos energy into it. Sword light filled the Holy Dragon City, and heavenly phoenix flames gathered in the skies to form a Nine-Tailed Phoenix.

The Nine-Tailed Phoenix was an inextinguishable existence, and it could revive endlessly. The Heavenly Phoenix Bloodline was one of the strongest bloodlines in the Huang Long World, and it was only weaker when compared to the Huang Long Bloodline flowing in Huang Xiaolong’s veins!

“Phoenix Sword as One, Sunder!”

Feng Nana’s voice rang through the skies, as her sword shot towards Huang Xiaolong. The Heavenly Phoenix behind her fused into her body, and she charged at Huang Xiaolong with her sword aiming straight for his heart. Boundless sword qi accompanied terrifying flames as she appeared before Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

By casually reaching out with his right arm, Huang Xiaolong flicked his middle finger once.

Thump.

The mountain range the Holy Dragon City sat on trembled once, and Feng Nana who had fused with the Heavenly Phoenix exploded into a million pieces. The sword qi dissipated, and a figure shot out like a cannonball towards the city below. Feng Nana’s body shattered walls after walls and her body only came to a stop when she arrived at the center of the Holy Dragon Race’s headquarters. Before anyone could react, she exploded into a ball of bloody mist.

A scream emerged from the Nine-Tailed Phoenix she had summoned the moment her body exploded, and its cries filled the skies.
