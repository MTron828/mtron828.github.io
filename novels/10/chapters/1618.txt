Jia Yuan gripped the commander’s reply transmission tightly in his hand and his throat went dry. He didn’t know what to say for a moment and his lips trembled unceasingly.

Despite breaking out in cold sweat, Jia Yuan didn’t dare to slow down in the slightest. Instead, he pushed himself to the limit as he traveled with unprecedented speed towards Huang Xiaolong’s residence.

“Quick, hurry up!”

Jia Yuan yelled at the army behind him.

When the five captains heard him, they were so frightened that they nearly crapped their pants. Circulating the godforce in their bodies to the limit, they followed behind Jia Yuan.

They turned around and yelled at their troops, “All of you, activate the speed talisman right now!”

All of the Netherguards were given a speed talisman and the moment they used it, their speed would double. The speed talisman was given to them so that they would be able to get out of sticky situations, however, the situation was too urgent and the captains no longer cared about the consequences.

“Yes, captain!”

Without the slightest hesitation, all of them infused their godforce into their speed talisman and light gathered around their bodies.

In an instant, their speed doubled.

When the big shots of the Brookspring Plane were rushing towards his residence, Huang Xiaolong was still practicing his sword arts in his courtyard.

Standing in the middle of the courtyard, Huang Xiaolong closed both his eyes and entered a mystical realm.

Even though his body wasn’t moving, sword qi rolled off his body unceasingly.

The sword qi that emerged from his body was fast at times, but slow at others. The sword qi seemed vicious at times, but gentle at others. They seemed to gather together, but they would separate as though they never existed in the next second.

The sword qi danced around and seemed to be sentient, forming ancient divine diagrams before scattering to form ancient sword formations. They would even take the shape of ancient sword talismans.

Huang Xiaolong’s body seemed to turn illusory. He would appear like a sharp sword at times and turn into a trace of sword qi in the next moment.

Seemingly able to detect the killing intent that was charging towards him from a distance, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes snapped open and two rays of terrifyingly sharp sword qi shot out from them.

Instead of using his divine soul, a vertical eye opened up in the space between his eyebrows.

The vertical eye was blood red, the color of hell itself.

It was precisely the Eye of Hell.

The Gu Family appeared in his eyes and Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes when he saw them. Seems like the Gu Family hasn’t given up!

The Fourth Order God King Realm?! Huang Xiaolong’s gaze rested on Gu Zheng.

No wonder...

It was as though a lightbulb lit up in Huang Xiaolong’s mind and he instantly understood why the Gu Family would dare to cause trouble for him even after learning of his identity as a God King. When he saw the robes on Gu Zheng’s body, Huang Xiaolong knew that he was an inspector sent by the main Gu Family.

A cold sneer appeared on his face. Taking a step forward, Huang Xiaolong appeared in the air above his residence as he waited calmly for the Gu Family’s arrival.

His four subordinates appeared behind him before long.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to wait for a long time. The members of the Gu Family appeared in his sights but they hadn’t brought too many people with them this time. There were only seventy to eighty of them, but the experts of other families couldn’t be said to be sparse in number. There were nearly ten thousand spectators present and they blotted out the sky.

The members of the Gu Family saw Huang Xiaolong floating above his residence and they turned to Gu Zheng, “Senior Gu Zheng, Ancestor, that’s the kid we’re looking for!”

Gu Zheng stared at Huang Xiaolong and chuckled, “Hehe, this kid isn’t retarded. He decided to stop running away.”

Ge Fei laughed as well. “That’s because he knows that he won’t be able to escape now that Senior Gu Zheng is here. He is even showing his respect by waiting for us to arrive!”

Gu Zheng couldn’t help but break out in laughter. “I hope that’s the case. If he kneels down and begs for forgiveness before vowing to serve our Gu Family, I might just spare his life. After all, he should be pretty talented to cultivate up to the God King Realm.”

“That is because Senior Gu Zheng is merciful... If you spare his life, he will be infinitely thankful to you.”

They didn’t bother hiding the contents of their conversation and everyone heard what they said, including Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s face turned frosty.

By the time they were done speaking, they arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

Gu Fei stared at him and started the ball rolling. “I believe you heard what Senior Gu Zheng said. You started everything by killing a member of my Gu Family and deserve to die. However, Senior Gu Zheng thinks that you have talent for cultivation and decided to spare your life as long as you kneel before him and beg for forgiveness.”

Gu Zheng folded his hands before him and raised his head to stare at the sky.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hold in his laughter anymore and he chuckled to himself as he shook his head.

Gu Zheng frowned and asked, “What are you laughing at?!”

“Hahaha, I bet you’re thinking that I’m a First Order God King because I told you that I broke through several tens of years ago. Is that why you’re confident of killing me?”

Gu Zheng was stunned but that didn’t stop him from laughing after thinking about it, “Kid, you barely broke through to the God King Realm several tens of years ago. Are you telling me that you were able to reach the Fourth or Fifth Order God King Realm in tens of years? Do you think that you’re a match for a Fourth Order God King like me?” He broke into explosive laughter after speaking.

Everyone who had come to watch the confrontation broke out into laughter as well.

“Alright. I’m too lazy to waste my time with you. I’ll give you ten seconds to consider your options.” Gu Zheng sneered and stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to make his move and dispose of all of them, a huge commotion broke out in the crowd behind Gu Zheng and everyone turned their focus to the space behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Lord Jia Yuan!” All the ancestors and elders who had followed behind the Gu Family greeted respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second and he turned to look at the space behind him. He saw Jia Yuan rushing towards him at breakneck pace and there was a huge army behind him. The armor on the bodies of the Netherguards shone blood red and it caused the hearts of those who saw them to palpitate. A horrifying killing intent filled the area.

Everyone felt their hearts go cold.

“Why is Lord Jia Yuan here?” One of the experts couldn’t wrap his head around it and discussion soon followed.

Gu Fei was shocked as well and he asked Gu Zheng, “Did the brat offend Lord Jia Yuan? Is that why he brought the Netherguards here to arrest him?”

Gu Zheng nodded his head and said, “I’m afraid that is the case.” He couldn’t think of another reason why Lord Jia Yuan would lead a grand army to look for Huang Xiaolong.

Under the suspicion and trepidation of everyone present, Jia Yuan arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

Jia Yuan used all his strength to rush all the way to Huang Xiaolong’s residence in order to prevent anything from happening to him. When he saw that Huang Xiaolong was unharmed and that no one was fighting, he heaved a sigh of relief. It was as though a weight was lifted off his heavy heart.
