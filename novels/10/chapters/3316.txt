Chapter 3317: Say That 100 Times

Lu Dingming and the members of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce weren’t the only ones who were stunned. Yagyu Motoichi and the members of the Yagyu Clan couldn’t believe what they were seeing either.

The members of the Fierce Tiger Gang felt the world spinning around them.

As for Murasakigawa Akira and the experts of the other families who were spying at the side, their jaws dropped in shock. 

It wasn’t anything special for a Ninth Level Nascent Soul cultivator to be killed, but when the other party did it without even moving, that was something to take note of!

“Who in the world is that kid from the Huaxia Alliance?!” Murasakigawa Akira thought of the most important problem at hand as he asked the various grand elders behind him.

Staring at each other in shock, all of them shook their heads.

“If none of you know who he is, why are you still standing here?! Look into his background, right now!” Murasakigawa Akira roared when he saw their reactions.

The grand elders, including Murasakigawa Takashi, snapped to attention as they rushed off.

The Murasakigawa Clan might be panicking, but the Iga Clan had it worse. They were in full blown panic-mode as the grand elders sprang into action to look into Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

One had to know that they were the ones who were supporting the Fierce Tiger Gang to hack away at the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce. Now that a random expert appeared out of nowhere, a terrifying one to boot, the Iga Clan felt that things were going south.

The Mitsui Clan and the Ice Palace weren’t as flustered, but they were also investigating Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

When the entire Japanese Alliance broke out into a fluster, Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards Yagyu Motoichi. He didn’t bother looking at the corpse of the grand elder he killed. 

He was walking slowly, but every step he took caused the members of the Yagyu Clan to suck in a cold breath. Even Yagyu Motoichi’s heart pounded in fear as he retreated subconsciously. Several dozen years ago, he faced the army of another country alone. Even then, he didn’t take a step back in fear! Now, he was retreating like a mouse before Huang Xiaolong!

Everyone stared at them in shock.

“Yagyu Motoichi… He… He’s stepping back!” 

“Kneel and I’ll spare your life.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air.

With their hearts pounding in fear, everyone thought that their ears were playing tricks on them.

There was actually a day when a doyen of the Yagyu Clan had to kneel before someone in order to preserve his life! 

Under the weird gazes of everyone present, Yagyu Motoichi’s heart was in turmoil. However, he drew the samurai sword around his waist as he roared in anger. “Baka! I’ll kill you right now!” 

Even though they were still separated by several tens of meters, the sword light slashed into Huang Xiaolong the instant he drew his sword.

A look of wild joy appeared on Yagyu Motoichi’s face when he saw that his sneak attack worked. The members of the Murasakigawa Clan, Iga Clan, and the other powers were stunned.

However, the smile froze on Yagyu Motoichi’s face all of a sudden. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t damaged at all, and not even his clothes were ruffled by his strike!

His sword qi seemed to be nothing more than a breeze that blew past Huang Xiaolong.

“How… How is this possible?!” Murasakigawa Akira stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even though they were watching from far, he could see that Huang Xiaolong didn’t use his true qi to stop the attack. In other words, Yagyu Motoichi’s sword qi definitely struck Huang Xiaolong’s body!

Despite that, the kid was completely fine!

Yagyu Motoichi was a Second Level Enlightenment Realm expert, and his sword art had already reached an extreme level! They couldn’t imagine how strong Huang Xiaolong’s physical body had to be in order to remain unharmed from the strike.

The members of the various factions stared at him in shock.

When they were still staring at him in stunned silence, Huang Xiaolong casually waved his arm and shattered Yagyu Motoichi’s samurai sword into several fragments. The sword that was crafted from the best metal essence found in the Japanese Alliance was shattered just like that!

The fragments flew towards Yagyu Motoichi and pierced through his body like it was made of tofu!

Flying backwards due to the impact, Yagyu Motoichi’s body was nailed to the wall by the fragments. Blood stained the building red.

A ray of light emerged from Yagyu Motoichi’s body as his nascent soul tried to escape. However, it was futile. Huang Xiaolong grabbed the void to drag his nascent soul over.

“Lord, please, please show mercy!” Yagyu Motoichi begged the instant he realized he was caught. Everyone could hear the fear in his voice.

“I gave you a chance. You would have lived if you kneeled.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. Tightening his grip, Yagyu Motoichi’s nascent soul exploded.

An eminent elder of the Yagyu Clan, an expert at the Enlightenment Realm, was killed in front of their eyes. A cultivator at his level was practically a god on Earth! However, he was killed like a bug on the street!

He couldn’t even take a single strike!

Silence descended on the lands.

Lu Dingming and the other members of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, and everyone present stared at Huang Xiaolong like they were looking at a monster. Zhang Yu, who chose to sit out of the battle, felt his legs trembling in fear. He snapped at Huang Xiaolong during the banquet, and now he knew that that was the wrong thing to do.

In the headquarters of the Murasakigawa Clan, Murasakigawa Takashi received a call from a member of the family, and he received the report. “Patriarch, Grand Elder Takashi, that… That expert from the Huaxia Alliance is Huang Xiaolong!”

“WHAT?! Huang Xiaolong of the Huang Family of the Dong Lin Province?!” Murasakigawa Akira screamed in fright.

The Japanese Alliance was beside the Huaxia Alliance, and they received reports on almost everything that went on there. They had long since heard of his deeds.

“It’s him!” The faces of Murasakigawa Takashi and Murasakigawa Akira changed immediately. Several days ago, they received the news that a youngster called Huang Xiaolong beheaded the old ancestors of the Chu and Zou Families in the span of ten minutes!

…

Huang Xiaolong looked at the members of the Yagyu Clan around him and snorted, “If you wish to live, kneel and start barking. Say that you’re a japanese dog, and repeat it a hundred times!”

Didn’t the members of the Japanese Alliance like to call him a chinese pig? He would ensure that the entire Yagyu Clan insulted themselves enough before he allowed them to live.

After all, there would definitely be videos of the incident. After he left, the video would soon make its round around the world.

“What?!” The grand elders and elders of the Yagyu Clan roared in rage. Even Lu Dingming and the members of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce stared at Huang Xiaolong in a strange way.
