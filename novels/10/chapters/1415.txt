Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged inside his room and summoned out his three avatars. Tiny ribbons of lightning flickered on his forehead as the Sea God Tower flew out from the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space.

This time, Huang Xiaolong was going to refine a Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit instead of a Fourth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit.

Huang Xiaolong believed that he could withstand the vast and robust energy from a Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit, since he was at peak late-Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm cultivation, and his current True Dragon Physique.

Then again, even if he could withstand the robust energy from a Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit, he still needed Xiang Xun to help him suppress the Sea God’s spirit.

Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars circulated their godforce according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium as they began to refine the Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s Spirit. Under Xiang Xun’s suppression, robust energy flowed out continuously from the Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit into Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars’ bodies.

Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars devoured the Sea God’s spirit’s energy, which enhanced and strengthened his own godforce.

Two months passed by in the blink of an eye...

At the end of these two months, Huang Xiaolong’s body suddenly started quivering as bright light spread out from his body and his momentum soared like tidal waves.

Late-Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm! The breakthrough was extremely smooth.

However, Huang Xiaolong did not stop absorbing the Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit’s energy. He continued to cultivate in seclusion for another month, until he and his three avatars had completely refined the Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit’s energy.

In the past, when Huang Xiaolong had first refined an early First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit, it had taken him a full three months, but now he was able to refine a Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit in three months. One could imagine the growth in Huang Xiaolong’s refining speed.

Not to mention, even an average Tenth Order God King Realm master would take more than three months to refine a Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit.

Huang Xiaolong’s strength had risen significantly after he had finished refining the Fifth Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit, and he was close to advancing to peak late-Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm.

His three avatars had already broken through to high-level Ancient God Realm, and had reached an early Eighth Order Ancient God Realm.

At this rate, by the time Huang Xiaolong would have broken through to Seventh Order or Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm, his three avatars would have probably broken through to Ancestor God Realm.

After exiting his room, Huang Xiaolong went searching for Feng Er to inquire about the outside news from the last three months. He was a little surprised to hear there had been no movements on Liang Ming and Wang Wei’s side.

As far as he knew, Liang Ming and Wang Wei weren’t the type of people to let the matters slide without doing anything. He had expected Wang Wei and Liang Ming to have made up some stories upon returning to the Fortune Gate branch and to have him captured by the Fortune Gate’s experts.

Although suspicious, Huang Xiaolong didn’t put this matter to his heart. More importantly, this had allowed him to cultivate in peace while waiting for the day of the auction to arrive.

In the remaining one month before the auction day, Huang Xiaolong chose to continue cultivating by swallowing chaos spiritual pills instead of refining the remaining four Sea God’s spirits. During the day, he concentrated on condensing mid grade-eight spirit stones, and took a stroll around the city in the late afternoon to purchase large amounts of top-grade chaos spiritual pills and chaos spiritual herbs.

Almost every evening,Huang Xiaolong returned from his stroll, with a lot of newly bought chaos spiritual herbs inside his spatial ring.

Huang Xiaolong selected some chaos spiritual herbs and threw them into the Pill Blending Tower.

A few days later, the Pill Blending Tower spat out a large number of top-grade chaos spiritual pills.

With Huang Xiaolong’s late-Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm cultivation, the Pill Blending Tower was able to churn out three thousand top-grade chaos spiritual pills in one night. That amounted close to one hundred thousand top-grade chaos spiritual pills in one month!

A hundred thousand pills! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Based on this speed, the amount of top-grade chaos spiritual herbs and relevant materials inside his chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space weren’t going to last long, hence, Huang Xiaolong was sweeping through the shops selling alchemy ingredients like a tornado.

Other than alchemy ingredients, Huang Xiaolong also bought top-grade chaos spiritual pills in large amounts. In short, he bought any chaos spiritual pills and chaos spiritual herbs that helped improve his cultivation, and threw those into the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space.

Within a month, Huang Xiaolong had almost bought all available top-grade chaos spiritual herbs and chaos spiritual pills in the city center.

Although this action was surely going to attract many people’s attention, he wasn’t bothered much by it. After all, he was going to leave the Royal Buddha Great Worlds immediately after the auction was going to end. Moreover, he was also not worried about people tailing him, as he was confident in the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s current speed.

On this fine day, the sun was radiant, and Huang Xiaolong was looking around in the city as he sat on the little cow, with Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and others by his side.

Next day was the day of the auction, therefore, Huang Xiaolong wanted to relax for the day. He was strolling idly, not really purchasing like he had done during this whole one month.

“Young Noble Huang!”

“Young Master Huang!”

Along the way, various people greeted Huang Xiaolong with enthusiastic smiles.

During this one month, Huang Xiaolong had almost swept clean all the city center’s shop’s top-grade chaos spiritual pills and top-grade chaos spiritual herbs. Hence, these shop owner’s enthusiasm wasn’t unexpected.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at them in return.

“I must get the God King’s Buddha Paste in the auction tomorrow!”

“I want to get those God King’s Buddha Pellets!”

Almost all the pedestrians on the street were talking about the auction.

“I really can’t figure out why the Thousand Autumns Buddha Sect Chief is selling the God King’s Buddha Pellet and Buddha Paste? I’ve heard that he’s going to take out six pieces of God King’s Buddha Paste for auction. Isn’t it better to use it for his own cultivation?”

“You may not know this, but the Thousand Autumns Buddha Sect Chief needs a batch of grade-eight spirit stones, that’s why he’s auctioning these two items.”

“Grade-eight spirit stones?! No wonder so many families’ Patriarchs and forces are scrambling to collect grade-eight spirit stones, they are aiming for the God King’s Buddha Pellet and Buddha Paste! In that case, not many forces will be able to afford them!”

“Although the God King’s Buddha Pellets and Buddha Paste are rare treasures, there are two other rare treasures in the auction this time. The auction house has not yet revealed these treasures, but these are surely going to be more precious than the former two items!”

The surroundings’ conversations continued to enter Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

However, Huang Xiaolong had been aware of this news since twenty days.

After Huang Xiaolong had learned about the other two superior treasures, when compared to the God King’s Buddha Pellets and Buddha Paste, he had become curious about them.

“Could it be number one and number two of the seven wonder fruits?” Xiang Xun took a guess as he listened to the surrounding conversations.

In the last auction, Huang Xiaolong had come across the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits. So, it was obvious Xiang Xun was thinking on those lines.

The little cow shook her head. “Not possible, no one would be stupid enough to take out the world’s number one and number two wonder fruits for auction.”

“Perhaps, a desolate era treasure?” Xu Baisheng guessed.

“Maybe, we’ll know tomorrow.” said Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had been out on a frenzy spree buying various top-grade chaos spiritual herbs and chaos spiritual pills, he had merely spent a thousand high grade-seven spirit stones. He had piled up all the grade-eight spirit in big mounds inside his spatial ring. This time, he wasn’t worried about insufficient funds.
