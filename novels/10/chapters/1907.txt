The Three Skull Ancestors sucked in a breath of cold air, looking at the several million li opening across the land surface, which led to a huge abyss below.

Even Huang Xiaolong himself got a fright. He had merely thrown out the little chaos ax casually. He hadn’t even used half his strength, but it had done this level of damage?

If he were to use his full force, what would happen?!

But he soon rejoiced.

Who would have thought that his Emperor’s will’s little chaos ax was so lethal!?

‘However, can it turn invisible?’ A thought suddenly came to Huang Xiaolong.

Other Emperor Realm experts’ Emperor’s will was something intangible. Hence it was invisible. Could his little chaos ax also turn invisible using this logic?

Thinking of this, Huang Xiaolong attempted to make the little chaos ax invisible. As expected, with his thought, the little chaos ax turned translucent, then became invisible.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong had his Emperor’s will turned back into the little chaos ax.

After having his Emperor’s will changing back and forth a couple of times, Huang Xiaolong got the hang of it.

Moreover, his little experiment had increased his understanding of his own Emperor’s will. For example, when in a tangible form, it could only appear as the little chaos ax, but when it was intangible, his Emperor’s will was free to take any shape to attack. It could turn into an invisible giant hand, a huge foot, a great invisible mountain, or a curtain of invisible blades.

However, the slight disadvantage was that in invisible form, his Emperor’s will’s attack power was significantly weaker.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong started checking the heart of hell in his chest. In his breakthrough to Emperor Realm, the heart of hell’s transformation was the most shocking one.

At this time, the heart of hell was the miniature version of Hell’s three worlds!

The Asura World, Spirits World, and Ghost World—these three worlds’ origin energy was compacted by a thousand times and flowed endlessly within the heart of hell.

The three worlds’ power enhanced each other, giving birth to vast and vigorous darkness energy.

Before Huang Xiaolong had stepped into Emperor Realm, the heart of hell had resembled an ocean that contained Hell three worlds’ origin energy. Whereas now, after breaking through to Emperor Realm, the heart of hell in Huang Xiaolong’s chest had completely shattered its shackles, and the space it held expanded many times over.

It was not an exaggeration to say the internal space within Huang Xiaolong’s heart of hell was as big as Hell’s three worlds itself!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart of hell contained the same amount of origin energy as the hell’s three worlds.

While Huang Xiaolong was sensing the boundless amount of energy within his heart of hell, there were sudden chaos qi fluctuations in the distant horizon.

Everyone was slightly disturbed.

Huang Xiaolong then chuckled delightedly. It was Lu Xiaoqing!

He had previously given Lu Xiaoqing two ginseng roots, and it seemed like she was about to reap the benefits by breaking through to Emperor Realm.

Huang Xiaolong had known it wouldn’t be difficult for Lu Xiaoqing to break through to Emperor Realm. However, it was still surprising that Lu Xiaoqing had actually broken through so fast.

Then again, Lu Xiaoqing’s breakthrough in such a short time was the contribution of the Great Radiance Formation arranged by the Radiance Angels. The Great Radiance Formation could speed up the time Lu Xiaoqing refined the two ginseng roots.

Seeing Lu Xiaoqing was about to break through, Huang Xiaolong decided to stay at the same location for a while.

Even so, it was going to take some time for Lu Xiaoqing to advance successfully, so they decided to wait there until she had broken through successfully.

On top of that, Huang Xiaolong could use this time to strengthen his new cultivation realm.

Thus, he sat cross-legged in mid-air. With a wave of his hand, the Glaze Devil Stele flew towards him.

Of course, he had successfully refined the Glaze Devil Stele at this point. Thus he could easily manipulate it.

While Huang Xiaolong was strengthening his Emperor Realm foundation inside the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield space, the ancient netherspirits in the space stopped running out of the space in fear. The terrifying pulses of the heart of hell had disappeared.

And the people on the other end of the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield space tunnel noticed the ancient netherspirits had stopped running out.

“It has stopped?!” Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie wondered out loud in delight. He quickly turned to Chiyou and asked, “Lord Chiyou, are we going in now?”

Chiyou’s eyes gleamed. He then nodded and ordered curtly, “Enter!” He was the first to rush into the space tunnel.

He, too, was very curious as to why the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield’s ancient netherspirits were fleeing out in fear.

Following closely behind Chiyou was Violent Lightning Archdevil, Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie, Hundred Transformation Sect’s Old Ancestor Chen Xie, and the rest disappeared into the space tunnel in a flicker.

“Chiyou Archdevil Ancestor, Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor, and others have gone in. Quickly follow them!”

“Maybe there’s a peerless treasure inside!”

“I think it’s a peerless ferocious creature, or else, why did those ancient netherspirits run out in fear!”

When experts of other forces saw that Chiyou Archdevil, Violent Lightning Archdevil, and others had entered the space tunnel, they followed in haste. However, those who suspected that it was a doing of a ferocious creature, stayed back and loitered at the entrance in a wait-and-see attitude.

Upon coming out of the other end of the space tunnel, Chiyou, Violent Lightning, and the others noticed the devil qi and death qi within the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield were richer than before. Not to mention, the whole space felt like a dead city, enshrouded in gloomy silence.

They had been here in the past. At that time, although the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield had been just as quiet, they had heard the occasional howls from ancient netherspirits. But now, they couldn’t even hear one howl, as if there was something in this space that terrorized these ancient netherspirits to the point that they dreaded to make a sound.

Chiyou’s brows creased into furrows. The atmosphere in this ancient battlefield gave him a suppressive feeling and a sense of strong unease.

Although this sense of unease was a little subtle, it still existed.

He gazed deeply towards the horizon of the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield.

“Second Brother, why don’t we withdraw for now?” Violent Lightning Archdevil hesitated before inquiring.

Chiyou felt uneasy, so did Violent Lightning. Not to mention that the feeling he had was even stronger than Chiyou.

Chiyou was dumbfounded when he heard Violent Lightning suggesting they withdraw. He looked at Violent Lightning and stated solemnly, “We will just go and take a look.” Chiyou was reluctant to withdraw so early on.

Thinking of Chiyou’s strength, Violent Lightning nodded in agreement in the end.

Hence, Chiyou, Violent Lightning, with several hundred people behind them, flew deeper into the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield.

Experts from various families spread out in the name of hunting for ‘treasure.”

Two weeks quickly went by.

Chiyou, Violent Lightning, and the others almost reached the center of the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield, with roughly two days of the journey left.

However, the closer Chiyou’s group was to the center, the unease Violent Lightning was feeling intensified many times over.

Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie, Hundred Transformation Sect’s Old Ancestor Chen Xie, and the others also had the same strong unease.

Another day passed.

Suddenly, Chiyou halted abruptly. The land up ahead was laden with cracks and deep fissures. The mountains were nothing but piles of crumbled boulders, and the forests were flattened.

Among the huge abysses, crumbled mountains, and destroyed forests, they also saw piles and piles of ancient netherspirits’ corpses.

Looking at the sight before them, Chiyou, Violent Lightning, and the others paled noticeably.

They could see most of these ancient netherspirits had Emperor Realm strengths, and many of them were Tenth Order Emperors.

“Who could have killed so many ancient netherspirits?!” Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie asked with much difficulty.

Everyone looked in the distance, up ahead.

There was a place obscured with layers of icy cold qi that did not disperse, hindering everyone from prying what was behind it.
