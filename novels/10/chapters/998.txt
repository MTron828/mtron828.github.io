Unable to get in touch with that inner disciple put Chen Jinzhi in a tight spot. Searching blindly for Huang Xiaolong on the vast Volcano Isle wasn’t an option, hence, he decided to lie in wait for Huang Xiaolong at the flying ship departing point.

He knew about Huang Xiaolong and Zhu Wanchen’s Submerging Dragon Ranking battle in nine months, it was inevitable that Huang Xiaolong needed to return to the sect before then. The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared, he would kill him at lightning speed without anyone being the wiser.

As Chen Jinzhi waited, times flew by.

Three months had passed since Huang Xiaolong stepped onto the island. His time was mainly divided between hunting demonic beasts and refining their godheads. Huang Xiaolong ignored the ones below the Heavenly God Realm; most of the time, his prey were at least late-Second Order Heavenly God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had steadily rose to perfection stage late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm, arriving at the limit of the Highgod Realm where he could attempt to breakthrough to the Heavenly God Realm at any time.

More importantly, his Heaven Opening Tenet had reached the peak of the first stage. Just one step more and he could advance to the second stage!

The iron and ore deposits found on this Volcano Isle were greater in number than he had imagined, it was basically prepared for him to cultivate the Heaven Opening Tenet. Even before Huang Xiaolong opened Eye of Hell, whether it was high up on the mountain peaks or deep underground, the place was filled with large deposits of iron ore calling his name.

Originally, he estimated he would need five to six months in order to reach the limit of the Highgod Realm, but now, the time had been shortened by half.

On this day, Huang Xiaolong was in a certain part of the island, looking down at a lake from a vantage point.

From above, the lake water was a charming emerald color, the lake was only several hundred meters in diameter, neither big nor small. In short, this place was negligible. But when Huang Xiaolong looked at the lake with his Eye of Hell, he was momentarily dazed.

Over a hundred meters underneath the lake was an ore vein several kilometers long, resembling a coiling fire dragon!

“This is, Extreme Yang Fire Ore vein?!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened in astonishment. It was a large vein of Extreme Yang Fire Ore!

This material was one of the highest grades of fire element ore, used in forging high level heavenly god grade divine artifacts, and could also be used to arrange a high-grade formation.

One fist-sized piece of Extreme Yang Fire Ore could fetch several thousand shenbi. How much would this several kilometer long Extreme Yang Fire Ore vein be worth?!

More importantly, with this ore vein, he could advance to the second stage of his Heaven Opening Tenet!

But Huang Xiaolong quickly calmed down from his excitement.

The Extreme Yang Fire Ore was too deep underground. With his current strength, he didn’t have the ability to move it unless he advanced to the Heavenly God Realm.

With his Heavenly God Realm strength, he would barely be able to pull the ore vein out from underground.

On the other hand, an ore vein’s formation took hundreds of thousands of years. Around this area, there was sure to be another spiritual treasure that came into existence with the ore vein.

Huang Xiaolong leaped down and began searching around the lake.

About fifteen minutes or so, high on a cliff not far from the lake, he spotted a deep green plant that was as thick as his arm. Hanging down from it were six small fruits the size of two thumbs, their surface like ink jadeite, possessing a beautiful luster. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

From afar, the small fruits appeared unassuming, but upon closer inspection these six small fruits exuded an enticing sheen akin to jade, clear and almost translucent.

“Ice Jade-ink Fruits!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in delight.

The Ice Jade-Ink Fruits were one of the rarer spiritual fruits of the Divine World, highly beneficial even to an Ancient God Realm master!

Huang Xiaolong did not expect the spiritual treasure accompanying the Extreme Yang Fire Ore vein to be the Ice Jade-ink Fruits. With these six fruits, he was fully prepared to breakthrough to the Heavenly God Realm.

However, he barely landed close to the cliff when a surprised and excited voice sounded: “Ice Jade-ink Fruits! Those are Ice Jade-ink Fruits!” In the next second, a powerful sword qi filled with killing intent flew toward his back.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even turn around to look at his attacker. In a flicker, he dodged the lethal sword qi, then with a wave of his palm blade, he chopped off the six Ice Jade-ink Fruits and collected them into a box with swift motions.

“Brat, put down those fruits!” Watching Huang Xiaolong easily dodging his attack and taking away the six Ice Jade-ink Fruits, the attacker bellowed in fury. In a flicker, the icy sword in his hand thrust at Huang Xiaolong, aimed directly at the center of his throat.

Huang Xiaolong planned to dodge, but knowing it was too late, he raised his arm, blocking it with his palm. His foot pushed against the ground and leaped back several hundred meters. There was a sword cut on his palm, bright and glaring as blood flowed out.

Opposite Huang Xiaolong stood a young man in a blue robe, holding a longsword.

Huang Xiaolong noticed the elephant emblem on the young man’s chest.

‘An Elephant Genesis Sect disciple!’

Moreover, the young man was an inner disciple of the Elephant Genesis Sect, a peak late-Second Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator that was half a step from the Third Order, far stronger than the Barbarian God Sect inner disciple Huang Xiaolong killed previously.

Huang Xiaolong could see that this person had great battle prowess, his strength many times above the average peak late-Second Order Heavenly God Realm.

On the other hand, the Elephant Genesis Sect inner disciple was inwardly shocked. He saw the black-haired young man shielding against his sword attack with his bare hands, but there was merely a light cut wound across his palm!

The young man’s disbelief could be seen from his eyes.

If the black-haired young man managed to dodge his first attack due to luck, then what about the second attack?

As Huang Xiaolong and the Elephant Genesis Sect young man were sizing each other up, sounds of piercing wind came from the distance.

Three disciples clad in the Barbarian God Sect inner disciple robe appeared in front of them.

The three of them came after detecting the powerful sword qi, but when they saw the Elephant Genesis Sect inner disciple’s face, their expressions darkened.

“Han Yang!” The three shouted simultaneously shouted.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, these three Barbarian God Sect inner disciples actually recognized this blue robed young man. It seems he was quite famous.

Huang Xiaolong was right. Han Yang wasn’t only an inner disciple, he was also the Elephant Genesis Sect’s Grand Elder Zhao Chenyuan’s personal disciple, possessing a high grade rank ten godhead.

Seeing the three Barbarian God Sect disciples appearing, Han Yang’s eyes shifted as an idea formed in his mind, “The three of you arrived at the right time. The box in that brat’s hand contains six Ice Jade-ink Fruits which I found first. Shall we cooperate and kill him, then equally distribute the six fruits? How about it?”

“What?! Ice Jade-ink Fruits!” The three Barbarian God Sect disciples’ gazes became feverish as they stared at the jade box in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

Despite the obvious loopholes in Han Yang’s story, the three of them weren’t bothered.

The three Barbarian God Sect disciples exchanged a glance.

“Han Yang, are your words true?” One of them asked Han Yang, referring to the equal distribution of the six Ice Jade-ink Fruits.

Two of the three Barbarian God Sect inner disciples were in the mid-Second Order Heavenly God Realm, while the last one was a peak early-Second Order Heavenly God.

Although the Barbarian God Sect levied heavy punishment for killing their sect brethren, for the sake of those Ice Jade-ink Fruits, it was worth it to them.

After the deed was done, who would know if the four of them kept silent?

Furthermore, the black-haired brat was just an outer disciple, the higher echelon wouldn’t really pursue the matter.

Han Yang smiled sweetly, “Naturally. I, Han Yang, have always kept my word. However, using equal distribution, I will take three while you three take three, no objections, right?”

“Deal!” The three didn’t even hesitate, nodding in agreement.

Han Yang’s strength was far above theirs, taking half of the Ice Jade-ink Fruits was only fair.
