Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest came to their senses at the little cow’s reminder. Their hearts eased, and they spread around Huang Xiaolong to protect him.

They absolutely believed Senior Xiaoniu’s words. Since Senior Xiaoniu had said that Huang Xiaolong would safely break through to the God King Realm, then Huang Xiaolong would successfully break through without a doubt.

Everyone was on alert, checking their immediate surroundings.

In this short time, Huang Xiaolong was completely enshrouded in brilliant flickering lights. It started with golden lights, then the rays of lights changed to yellow, red, green, azure, blue, and so on, reflecting a prism of colors.

As Xiang Xun, and the others stood on the watch, they clearly felt Huang Xiaolong’s ever rising and startling momentum.

In the beginning, the late-Second Order God King Realm Xu Jiang could still withstand the pressure coming from Huang Xiaolong, but as time passed, Xu Jiang found it increasingly hard to breathe as if there was a mountain pressing down on him.

Even the little cow felt the pressure.

Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng promptly released their godforce forming a protective barrier which immediately reduced the pressure on Xu Jiang, Feng Er, and the rest.

Unknowingly, ten days went by.

The cocoon of lights enshrouding Huang Xiaolong was still ever changing.

Half a month later, there was an aura of immortality intermingling with Huang Xiaolong’s rising cultivation.

The aura of immortality was quite unique and only the cultivators who had broken through to the God King Realm could sense it. Thus, Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Xu Shi, Xu Jiang, and Xu Yong could sense the increasingly intense aura of immortality coming from Huang Xiaolong. The aura of immortality around Huang Xiaolong gradually condensed into vague shadows!

“This is...?!” Xu Baisheng exclaimed in confusion and shock as he stared at these vague shadows.

The little cow spoke, “These are the shadows of the immortal body. Only when those freak geniuses are about to break through to the God King Realm, such a phenomenon would manifest.”

“Shadows of the immortal body?!” Xu Jiang, Xu Yong, and Feng Er exclaimed in unison.

Xiang Xun chimed in, “That’s right, I have heard of this from my Ancestor. When this immortal body’s shadow phenomenon manifests as someone breaks through to God King Realm, that person would experience a close to perfect body transformation, achieving the essence of an immortal body.”

Xu Baisheng, Xu Jiang, Xu Yong, Feng Er, and others understood what was happening.

After realization, astonishment set in their hearts.

True immortal body?

“It’s not as dramatic as what Kiddo Xiang Xun said. There is no such thing as a true immortal body in this world. Even an Emperor Realm master could die just the same. However, it is true that those who could trigger the immortal body shadow phenomenon have a stronger body than the average God King Realm. For instance, if God King Realm cultivators get injured severely, with their internal organs shattered, they would need a month to heal, but Xiaolong only needs an hour or so to heal.”

“If the attack power were to exceed the limit Xiaolong’s body endurance, he would die just the same.”

Right at this time, the vague immortal body’s shadows around Huang Xiaolong suddenly swayed, rearranging themselves into a mysterious ancient formation...?

Speckles of immortal energy light floated out from these shadows towards Huang Xiaolong, entering his body. At the same time, a profound and incomprehensible sound came from the inside of Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Others watched with wide, dumbfounded eyes.

What is this now?

Inquiring gazes from all around fell on the little cow, hoping for enlightenment.

But the little cow shook her head, looking somewhat awkward as she said, “This, erm, this old cow doesn’t know what’s going on either. Don’t ask me.”

The shadows of an immortal body could form an ancient formation? And even emit immortal energy that envelops the person in the midst of a break through to further improve his body’s transformation, bringing it closer to the perfect immortal body?

Despite the little cow’s vast knowledge and many years of living, she had never heard of this kind of phenomenon.

But she could see that Huang Xiaolong’s body was transforming faster, becoming stronger, moving closer to perfection inside the cocoon of immortal energy. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She had a lot of Emperor Realm juniors in her tribe, but when they had broken through to the God King Realm, none of their bodies had been able to transform as fast and perfectly as Huang Xiaolong.

.....

Another month passed.

Tiny streams of immortal energy wafted out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, gathering above Huang Xiaolong’s head into a cloud, exuding vigorous vitality.

Upon closer inspection, this vitality was slightly different.

Influenced by this vitality, dense green plants sprouted on the four walls, down to the passageway.

These plants seemed alive, akin to spirited and cute elves.

Xiang Xun and the others were even more dumbfounded by this sight. Once again, their inquiring gazes fell on the little cow.

But the little cow did not say a word because she too was looking at the cloud above Huang Xiaolong’s head with a dumbfounded expression. She was just as stupefied as everyone else as she stared at the spirited and lively elf-plants growing everywhere.

This... What the heck are these?

Her head was filled with question marks while waves of shock struck her heart.

Another two months came and went.

The cloud formed from Huang Xiaolong’s immortal energy was several times denser and bigger. It’s vigorous vitality had reached the other end of the passageway to the door, everywhere the vision was filled with swaying elf-plants.

Driven by curiosity, Feng Er reached out to touch one of the elf-plants. These elf-plants did not dodge her touch, allowing her to touch them. Feng Er felt warmth under her fingertips, and smoothness, and a kind of energy flowed from the elf-plants into Feng Er’s body. A comfortable feeling filled Feng Er, it was so comfortable that she felt like sighing aloud.

Taking Feng Er’s lead, Xu Baisheng and others also reached out to touch the elf-plants. They too felt a comfortable energy entering their bodies.

The little cow also nudged one of the elf-plant and was immediately shocked. She turned to Xu Baisheng and the rest saying, “The energy within these plants is extremely beneficial to your cultivation, quickly sit down and cultivate, strive to breakthrough!” She then looked at Xiang Xun, “Kiddo Xiang Xun, you stand on guard for Xiaolong and us!”

Xiang Xun was about to comply, but the little cow had already sat down entering cultivation, absorbing the energy from the elf-plants.

Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest also quickly sat down and entered cultivation at the little cow’s words.

The little cow could see that it did not affect Huang Xiaolong in any way when they absorbed these elf-plants’ energy, therefore, there was no concern about disturbing Huang Xiaolong’s breakthrough to the God King Realm.

Half a year went by.

The immortal cloud over Huang Xiaolong’s head had stretched out of the palace, enshrouding the entire golden dragon stones mountain. The elf-like plants had already grown to every corner of the golden dragon stones mountain, and even the experts trapped in the maze could sense brimming vitality in the air.

......

On a certain day three years later, the entire golden dragon stones mountain shook. Intense prisms of colors rushed out from the palace, accompanied by a resounding dragon’s roar that reached every corner of the Tianwu Treasure.

A blue primordial divine dragon soared to the sky, waves of majestic dragon might rushed out in all four directions.

This sudden burst of vitality naturally shocked the experts trapped within the maze.

A long time later, the intense colorful lights dimmed and disappeared. So did the blue primordial divine dragon that had soared to the sky.

Inside the palace, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and breathed out through his mouth. As he moved, muffled popping noises could be heard as if a thunder was rumbling inside him.

Finally, he had broken through to God King Realm!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone with delight. It was an unexpected gain to breakthrough to God King Realm from refining the Tianwu Treasure’s core formation. On top of that, after undergoing the transformation, his True Dragon Physique has become very, very strong! Much stronger than he could ever imagine!
