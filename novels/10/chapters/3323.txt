Chapter 3324: Close The Gates

“Four years?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“Yes. The Kunlun Paradise opened seventy years ago, and every time it opens, it will remain open for several days. According to what we know, the paradise will open again in four years.” Yuan Hui replied.

He continued to explain what one could find in the Kunlun Paradise, and he felt that there should be some sort of seal due to a treasure within. That was also what produced the changes to Earth in the first place to usher in the cultivation era.

“Do you know what the treasure is?”

“I do not know. However, it should be left behind by some ancient expert.” Yuan Hui shook his head. “Other than the six strongest factions on Earth right now, everyone else is also here for the treasure.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly in acknowledgement.

“Now, everyone feels that the treasure will emerge the next time the Kunlun Paradise opens!” 

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. There was no way an ordinary treasure would cause an entire world to change. From his guesses, he felt that the treasure had to be the Pangu Axe!

“Bring me to the island right now.” Huang Xiaolong got to his feet.

Since he learned that the Pangu Axe could be located in the Kunlun Paradise, there was no need to wait for four years!

“Your Highness, there are four years till the seal opens…” Yuan Hui explained.

“Don’t worry about it. Just bring me there.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hands to dismiss Yuan Hui’s concerns.

Not daring to go against Huang Xiaolong’s order, the two of them left after Huang Xiaolong bade Lu Dingming farewell.

Of course, he reminded Lu Dingming to refine the Blue Dragon Pills as soon as he could before leaving.

Urging Huang Xiaolong to stay, Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Uncle Dingming, my father and I will pay you a visit soon.”

“Alright, alright!” Lu Dingming roared with laughter, “I will personally pick your father up from the airport this time!”

“Sure!” 

As they sent him off, Huang Xiaolong and Yuan Hui soared through the skies and disappeared into the horizon.

With their speed, they managed to leave the city before long as they headed straight for the Ying Island.

The island was located off the coast of the Japanese Alliance, and they arrived in a short hour.

As the Ying Island was pretty large, there were cities and villages laid all around. Villagers were fishing peacefully along the shores and they painted a peaceful scene.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong released his divine sense as he started to explore the surroundings. Despite that, he failed to notice anything interesting.

A frown formed on his face.

“Are you sure the entrance of the Kunlun Paradise is located here?”

“There is no doubt about it. I double checked, and this is the entrance of the Kunlun Paradise. It was created by an ancient being in the Huaxia Alliance in the past, and the restrictions were laid down by the same person. If the seal remains closed, no one will be able to find the entrance.” Yuan Hui explained.

A weird light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. 

Ancient cultivator?

Unresigned, Huang Xiaolong flew another round around the island. Even so, he failed to discover anything.

He could only choose to give up.

“Looks like I have to wait for four years…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

After all, four years wasn’t a long time.

To him, four years would pass in the blink of an eye.

When he retrieved the Pangu Axe in four years and cultivated the Pangu World Creation Art, he would be able to reach the peak of power after producing enough grand cosmos energy in his third small world! Then that happened, he would be able to enter the God of Creation Realm!

When Huang Xiaolong was looking about, Zhang Yuhan and the students of the Eastern University were fighting against the beasts that were rushing towards the shore.

It wasn’t long after Huang Xiaolong’s departure before the appearance of the beast tide. They students fought for the entire day, and Zhang Yuhan had no idea how many beasts she killed.

Even as a Ninth Level Nascent Soul Realm cultivator, she was exhausted after a single day of battle. 

The students of the Eastern University stayed by her side and their bodies were dyed red with blood. Luckily for all of them, the blood belonged to the beasts.

“Teacher Yuhan, we should return to the city.” One of the students advised. After all, they saw the unending wave of beasts and knew that they wouldn’t be able to last if they kept fighting without rest.

“Alright. Return to the city!” Zhang Yuhan nodded. However, before they could return, two figures soared through the skies and there were more than several dozen thousand beasts chasing them.

The beasts in the lead emitted a shocking aura, and they were beasts who were comparable to Enlightenment Realm experts!

The faces of Zhang Yuhan and the others changed instantly.

With the speed of the beasts, they would arrive in less than ten breaths of time!

There was no way they would be able to enter the city gates in time!

“Run! Retreat back to the city!” One of the captains in the formation yelled.

As the students and the teachers of the various universities started to panic, they charged towards the city gates.

“Damn humans! Return the Yuanpin Heavenly Pearl to our Eastern Sea Race!” The beasts leading the charge roared in rage.

From what they heard, everyone got a general idea of the story. The two Enlightenment Realm experts probably stole something from the Eastern Sea Race before running back to one of the cities.

The two of them weren’t weak either. In a flash, they passed Zhang Yuhan and the others as they entered the city.

As soon as they entered, they roared at the supervisor guarding the city. “Close the gates and activate the formation!”

A look of terror appeared on the supervisor’s face. He stared in the direction of Zhang Yuhan and the others as he stuttered, “But… But… They’re not back yet!”

If they closed the city gates and activated for formation, there would only be one way things would end. Zhang Yuhan and the others would definitely be killed by the incoming swarm!

“I’m the old ancestor of the Thousand Extermination Sect! I order you to close the gates right now! Otherwise, I’ll cut you down right here and now!” One of the two roared.

Old ancestor of the Thousand Extermination Sect!

With his expression flickering, the supervisor had no idea how to respond. After all, the Thousand Extermination Sect was as famous as the Taizhen Sect and the other top tier sects. Even though the old ancestor of the Thousand Extermination Sect wasn’t as strong as Yuan Hui, he was still a Ninth Level Enlightenment Realm cultivator.

As the headquarters of the Thousand Extermination Sect was located in Huaxia, their influence there was pretty strong.

“Lord Huang Xiaolong’s nephew and Teacher Zhang Yuhan of the Eastern University are both out there!” In a last ditch attempt, the supervisor yelled.

Even though he was only a Golden Core Realm Cultivator, he was a disciple of the Li Family. He heard some stories of what happened recently.

“Who the f*ck is Huang Xiaolong?! If you talk anymore crap, I’ll kill you!” The old ancestor of the Thousand Extermination Sect yelled.

As he had been busy stealing the pearl, he didn’t hear anything about Huang Xiaolong in the past few days.

Under the threat of the old ancestor of the Thousand Extermination Sect, the supervisor could only order for the gates to close.

“NO!” As the students and teachers saw the gates slamming shut, they knew that everything was over for them.
