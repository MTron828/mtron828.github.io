Another three days passed peacefully.

On this night, Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged inside the Xumi Temple. Just like every night, godforce and God’s Law from the rank five godhead flowed endlessly into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

In his Qi Sea, god battle qi was swirling intensely. Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that, tonight, he’d be able to breakthrough to Seventh Order God Realm.

All of a sudden, a powerful suction force came from his Qi Sea. The Treasure Dragon Protective Shield Art diagram inside his body emitted a dazzling light, devouring the godforce and God’s Law from the godhead at a crazy speed.

‘This..?’ Huang Xiaolong was surprised by the sudden change.

While he was still in a surprised state, inside his Qi Sea, god battle qi continued to rumble with vigor akin to a primordial beast ready to pounce, rushing into every part of his meridians, expanding them.

As his god battle qi coursed violently through his meridians, Huang Xiaolong clearly sensed the Seventh Order God Realm barrier.

Like his previous breakthrough, he tried to control the god battle qi rampaging in his meridians to crash against the barrier, repeating this action many times over.

Unaware of the passage of time, Huang Xiaolong’s body suddenly quivered. Like a dam breaking from the forces of turbulent waters, the barrier to Seventh Order God Realm crumbled!

Huang Xiaolong’s Qi Sea began to expand like crazy, as did his soul sea, while the time and space law above his soul sea matured further, multiplying in the process.

At the very same moment Huang Xiaolong succeeded, the Xumi Temple itself shook as golden Buddha images, numerous great Asuras, and a horde of divine dragons soared into the sky.

The clear sky above the Golden Dragon Peak was transformed, filled with golden Buddhas, Asuras, and divine dragons rushed upward.

The Huang Family and others on the Golden Dragon Peak were alarmed, all of them hurried out of their yards to witness the wondrous sight above the peak.

It was a long time later that the images of golden Buddhas, Asuras, and divine dragons in the sky gradually dissipated.

Due to the grand formation acting as a veil, the incident went unnoticed by other Red Flood Mountain Range elite disciples, otherwise, with such a large momentum, it would have attracted other elite disciples for miles away to the Golden Dragon Peak.

After the images in the sky disappeared, Huang Xiaolong slowly opened his eyes. Getting up to his feet, the entire Xumi Temple quivered from his mere movements. A light step carried the strength of a hundred million horses, he could easily crumble a big mountain in a single step.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone with elation—he finally broke through to Seventh Order God Realm!

As his spiritual force spread over his body, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the immortal essence energy in his dantian had become more robust, more potent, and even purer. Flipping his palm over, a spark of immortal essence fire appeared, swaying gently on his palm, glowing in an amber diamond light that could make one wary from staring straight at it.

With this enhanced immortal essence fire, the medicinal pellets that he refine would achieve a higher grade, quality, and efficiency.

Huang Xiaolong exited the Xumi Temple, appearing high in the air above the Golden Dragon Peak in a flicker. Raising an arm, he pointed a finger at a mountain peak in the distance. In the blink of an eye, an invisible force bore a hole through the peak and went on to the mountain behind it.

The force of a single finger pierced through several mountain peaks.

Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction at this result, then floated down to the ground.

Being aware that everyone on the Golden Dragon Peak was staring at him, Huang Xiaolong smiled sheepishly, explaining, “It just so happened that I broke through to Seventh Order God Realm by luck.”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong confirming their thoughts, everyone blanked for a second before whooping in delight.

They knew very well what a Seventh Order God Realm represented.

While the Huang Family was immersed in their joy, a Saint realm subordinate entered, reporting respectfully to Huang Xiaolong that there were two Black Warrior Institute Elders waiting outside, wanting to see Huang Xiaolong. One of them was Hu Yue, and the other was Li Jiarong.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrow rose to his forehead. These two Elders were subordinates of that old witch Wang Na, what purpose did they have in coming here to see him? Pondering briefly, Huang Xiaolong said to his subordinate, “Bring them to the front hall.”

The Saint realm subordinate acknowledged respectfully and retreated. Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had matters to attend to, the Huang Family also dispersed.

Huang Xiaolong walked neither hurriedly nor slow to the front hall. Moments later, the same Saint realm subordinate was seen leading two elderly looking men inside. One of them was fair and round, and the other was tall and skinny.

Despite the limited interaction with these two Elders, Huang Xiaolong had seen both of them during the inner disciple assessment many years ago, thus he knew that the fair round man was Hu Yue, while the tall skinny one was Li Jiarong.

After leading the two Elders in, the Saint realm subordinate took his leave.

Huang Xiaolong did not bother to step forward in welcome, instead, he walked straight to the host seat in the hall and sat down, asking, “May I know what matter both Elders have to come all the way here?” Since both men were that old witch Wang Na’s subordinates, he need not show any courtesy.

Anger flashed in Hu Yue and Li Jiarong’s eyes at Huang Xiaolong’s less than welcoming attitude toward their visit. Even if Huang Xiaolong was the Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang’s personal disciple, he was also an elite disciple of the institute. An elite disciple was required to respectfully salute an Institute Elder.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re too impudent!” Li Jiarong wouldn’t stand for Huang Xiaolong’s attitude, his temper flared and barked at Huang Xiaolong, “As an elite disciple of our Black Warrior Institute, you actually did not stand up to welcome Institute Elders and salute respectfully! According to the institute’s rules, you’re to receive a thousand rod strikes from the Punishment Hall!”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained the same, showing no anger nor joy, “Just this? I’ve taken note. If there’s nothing else, please return.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The person in charge of the Punishment Hall was Grand Elder Bao Xinrui, a left and right hand man in his Master Feng Yang’s camp.

Li Jiarong’s anger surged, pointing a finger at Huang Xiaolong: “You!”

“That’s enough.” Hu Yue spoke, interjecting Li Jiarong. He turned to Huang Xiaolong, saying, “Huang Xiaolong, we did not come here today for any important matters. We heard that you can refine Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pills?”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrow rose with interest: “Correct.”

Blessed Buddha Emperor, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the rest all broke into the God Realm after consuming Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pills. This matter could hardly be kept a secret from the Black Warrior Institute’s higher echelon.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong admitting, Hu Yue continued, “The Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pills can increase the chances of a half-step God Realm breaking through to God Realm by fifty percent. There are many talented outer disciples that have been stuck at this stage for their entire life, unable to step into the God Realm. However, with these Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pills, many of these outer disciple geniuses can successfully breakthrough to God Realm. At that time, the number of our Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciples would increase by several folds, even tenfold and higher!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled coldly, “And?”

These two people, although they had yet to state their purpose in the open, Huang Xiaolong could more or less guess it.

Hu Yue went on, “This way, our Black Warrior Institute’s overall strength would greatly increase. At some point down the line, we could even surpass the Azure Dragon Institute, becoming the chief of all four institutes, therefore, we hope that you could pass the Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pill formula to our Black Warrior Institute.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly, just as he expected.

To actually come knocking at his door so righteously to request his Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pill formula for free!

After behaving for the past two decades, Wang Na that old witch couldn’t stand the loneliness any longer. These two daring to come to his place asking for the Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pill formula must be due to that old witch Wang Na’s instructions. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have the guts to do so.

“And after that?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice hardened.

Seeing this, Li Jiarong once again reprimanded Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, as a Black Warrior Institute disciple, contributing the Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pill formula to the institute is something you should do! When the time comes, the inner disciples that successfully broke through to God Realm after consuming Swallowing Sky Starquake Divine Pills will feel grateful to you!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted, “Feel grateful? Why don’t both of you contribute your mothers to the institute? If you offer them to the Black Warrior Institute disciples, I believe all the institute’s disciples will feel endlessly grateful to you!”
