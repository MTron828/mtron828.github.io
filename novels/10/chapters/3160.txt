Chapter 3161: Huang Shuai Must Not Escape!

Huang Rong’s face sank when he heard Huang Xiaolong say there was only garbage by his side, but then again, Huang Xiaolong’s words were not unreasonable. In comparison to the ten overlords and ten beast kings, the experts on his side were indeed much worse.

The sole expert, who could be taken out of the garbage list, was the Vice Main Mystical Pavilion Master, who was his second younger brother.

“Huang Rong, aren’t you curious about how I learned that you’ve come to the Golden Spider Black Region?” Huang Xiaolong asked suddenly.

Huang Rong’s pupils were needled by the question. Because the people that knew he had come to the Golden Spider Black Region were the ones he had come with, and then there was his second younger brother.

Right at this time, a light flashed around Huang Xiaolong as two people appeared.

They were the Son of Mystic and the Vice Main Mystical Pavilion Master!

“Feng’er!”

“Second Brother!”

Seeing that his son and second younger brother had fallen into Huang Xiaolong’s hands, Huang Rong’s face was unprecedentedly gloomy. His minor completion power of space surged, and he appeared almost instantaneously in front of his son and younger brother.

However, just as Huang Rong wanted to grab them away, a palm strike suddenly landed on Huang Rong’s chest at a speed that was not slower than Huang Rong’s.

Huang Rong was startled, and in this situation, he couldn’t take care of the two people anymore. He quickly twisted his body and slapped out with his palm.

Two palms met in the air, and Huang Xiaolong was sent tumbling miserably, as a result.

Huang Xiaolong had exerted his full strength in this palm stroke, using all thirteen elements’ power and three small worlds’ energy compressed into this strike.

Huang Rong’s movements stagnated for a split second, and his blood flowed chaotically, as blood trickled out from the corner of his mouth. He was severely injured!

“You—, thirteen elements of absolute power!” Huang Rong stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, and he was shocked to the point that he couldn’t manage his facial expression anymore. Moments ago, he had thought eleven elements power was Huang Xiaolong’s full strength, and never did he imagine that Huang Xiaolong had actually comprehended all thirteen elements!

Despite his injuries, he still denied that Huang Xiaolong had successfully comprehended thirteen elements of absolute power!

He had begun to pay attention to Huang Xiaolong ever since he had defeated Huang Shuai at the time of the Creation Ceremony in the Divine Tuo Holy World. At that time, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was merely at the First Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. In his eyes, that was no different than the smallest, insignificant shrimp. He thought that it would take less than the snap of his fingers to kill Huang Xiaolong. However, his disregard had given Huang Xiaolong the time to grow.

In his opinion, it would give him more pleasure and satisfaction to squash Huang Xiaolong to death when Huang Xiaolong had grown to a certain strength, but never did he imagine that in a short two to three thousand years, Huang Xiaolong’s strength would reach this extent! To the point that he had managed to comprehend the thirteen elements' energies! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Huang Xiaolong, I’ve underestimated you!” Shock and rage roiled in Huang Rong’s eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “Had I known this, I would have gone to the Divine Tuo Holy World and pinched you to death myself!”

His gut twisted with regret for not nipping a trouble in the bud which had given Huang Xiaolong the time to grow instead.

Huang Xioalong sneered, “You won’t be able to escape, so just hand over the Huang Long Heart, and Huang Long Cape!” As he said that, he threw the Son of Mystic and the Vice Main Mystical Pavilion Master back into the Sun Moon Furnace.

Huang Rong exuded icy coldness at Huang Xiaolong’s action, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think you’re invincible after comprehending thirteen elements of absolute powers? Since you know who I am, you should know the strength of the family behind me. If you know what’s good for you, release Feng’er and my brother right now. If anything happens to them, not only you, but the entire Huang Long World will be buried with them!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong’s tone was tepid.

Huang Rong added, “Even if they die, my family can resurrect them at any time!”

It was because there was more than one expert in his family that had mastered the power of time and space at perfection level!

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t affected by Huang Rong’s words at all, and he responded nonchalantly, “Power of space and time at perfection level can resurrect the dead, but it consumes a lot from the caster, and it’s not a small price to pay. Do you think your family would be willing to pay such a price to resurrect your son and your younger brother?”

Huang Rong’s heart sank but he had to admit that what Huang Xiaolong said was true. Resurrecting the dead was difficult, to say the least, and there was definitely a hefty price to pay for it. In a family such as theirs, even if a core disciple died, there was no chance of them being resurrected, unless it was a core disciple who was set to be the next patriarch.

To be set as the family’s next patriarch, one needed to have comprehended the thirteen elements of absolute power, and all of them had to have reached perfection level! Only such a monstrous genius disciple was worthy of their family to pay the price of a resurrection.

Therefore, not to mention his son and his younger brother, but even if he was the one who died, the family would not choose to resurrect him.

“Huang Xiaolong, even if my son and younger brother won’t be resurrected by the family after they die, my family won’t spare you.” Huang Rong pointed out coldly, “In the boundless universe, whoever goes against my family has no good ending. The strength of my family is not someone like you can imagine, so you’d better think it through really well before acting!”

“Think it through?” Huang Xiaolong let out a harsh chuckle, and in the next moment, he appeared right in front of Huang Rong with both his palms striking out. As the force surged from Huang Xiaolong’s palms, Huang Rong panicked when he sensed his immediate surroundings were frozen in time. Even the movements of his own actions were much too slow for his liking!

This was the power of time!

Huang Xiaolong’s power of time had also reached minor completion, thus he was able to control the time flow within a certain radius, and within this area, he could both accelerate or slow down time!

Almost at the same time as Huang Xiaolong’s strike landed, Huang Rong pushed his power of space to retreat, but he was still a step too slow.

Boom!

Huang Xiaolong’s palms strikes merely brushed past Huang Rong’s chest, and even so, sounds of breaking bones could be heard, and at the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred away and appeared once again in front of Huang Rong with the Huang Long Blades in his hands.

“The rest of you go look for Huang Shuai. He mustn’t escape!” Huang Xiaolong ordered Cang Xun and the rest as he swung out the blades in his hands.

After so long, neither Huang Shuai or anyone else have shown up so far, which indicated that they were trying to refine the Huang Long Heart while Huang Rong delayed Huang Xiaolong.

As expected, when Huang Rong heard Huang Xiaolong’s order, panic flashed across his face, but being besieged by the Huang Long Blades in Huang Xiaolong’s hands, he did not have the luxury of worrying about others. He could only watch Cang Xun, Di Shuang, and the rest fly away.

As for Yuan Tianyi, he stood and watched Huang Xiaolong and Huang Rong battle from the side with a cold, indifferent gaze.

It would be a lie to say he wasn’t tempted by the Huang Long and Huang Long Cape, but after the miserable lessons from the Tree of Origin and blood moon, Yuan Tianyi understood deeply that even if he took action, he wouldn’t be able to refine the two treasures. Therefore, it was better for him to not see the two treasures.

The weapons in Huang Rong’s hands were two huge blades that had just blocked the Huang Long Blades’ attack, yet there were two big cracks running down them. Huang Rong was shocked, but he also noticed Yuan Tianyi, standing still.

Could it be that this person is not in the same group as Huang Xiaolong?

While Huang Xiaolong battled Huang Rong, Cang Xun, Di Shuang, and the rest quickly found Huang Shuai and the group of Mystical Pavilion’s experts. Huang Shuai and these experts were seated in a circle around an enormous heart that exuded a rich dragon qi, and also low-sounding dragon roars.
