Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu relaxed a little after hearing the confidence in Huang Xiaolong’s voice.

Still, the siblings’ nerves were stretched taut when they saw the number of experts Prince Chen had brought at the fort gates.

The siblings knew very well that the several experts by Prince Chen’s side were all Second Order Heavenly God Realm masters.

On the other side of the fort gates, Prince Chen was enjoying the fort’s scenic surroundings. When he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s group’s presence, he turned and spotted Feng Er beside Huang Xiaolong, and his eyes lit up immediately.

Even though Tie Xinlan was also a beauty, she’s still uncomparable to Feng Er’s icy allure.

Prince Chen said to the expert beside him, “Looks like it was the right decision coming to the Tie Family Fort ah. This Tie Family Fort is hiding a beauty here, excellent, excellent!” He laughed wantonly as if displaying his excitement.

The experts by Prince Chen’s side snickered in agreement.

“Congratulations, Prince Chen! Only such a beauty is compatible with Prince Chen, given Prince Chen’s heroic spirit!”

“Prince is handsome and chivalrous, naturally, he should have such a beauty as his companion.”

These experts’ flattery rang continuously.

A cold light flashed in Feng Er’s eyes when she heard these people’s remarks, as she was following Huang Xiaolong.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong’s group had arrived at the gates of the Tie Family Fort.

“Is he that so-called Prince Chen?” Huang Xiaolong asked as he watched Prince Chen with interest. He was in no hurry to to torture him to his death yet.

“Insolent, why aren’t you on your knees, saluting Prince Chen?!” One of Prince Chen’s Second Order Heavenly God Realm experts snapped seeing Huang Xiaolong’s attitude. His reached out to grab Huang Xiaolong as he reprimanded Huang Xiaolong.

“No hurry!” Prince Chen shook his head and laughed nonchalantly. He said, “Don’t frighten the pretty lady.”

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, Xi Jiang, Xu Shi, and others broke out into a fit of laughter looking at the ‘magnanimous expression’ on Prince Chen’s face.

Prince Chen frowned looking at them. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong asked Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu, “Who was the person who injured Fort Lord Tie?”

Tie Xinlan, Tie Mu, Prince Chen and his cronies blanked momentarily.

“It’s him!” Though Tie Mu didn’t know what Huang Xiaolong was planning, he decisively pointed at a Second Order Heavenly God Realm expert by Prince Chen’s side. This was the same person who had reprimanded Huang Xiaolong, ordering him to kneel before Prince Chen.

This Second Order Heavenly God Realm expert stood proudly with his chin up, and ridiculed Huang Xiaolong, “What? You want to avenge him?” He whooped in laughter before continuing, “But a weakling like you, with thin arms and legs won’t be capable of avenging him.”

Prince Chen and the rest of his group all laughed loudly.

Prince Chen generously introduced the Second Order Heavenly God Realm expert who reprimanded Huang Xiaolong, “I forgot to tell you that this person by my side is one of my country’s top experts who has garnered the nickname Herculean God of War.”

However, Prince Chen had barely finished his introduction, when he saw Feng Er raise her slender hand, and in the next second, the Herculean God of War was pulled right in front of her. She tightened her slender hand into a fist, and sounds of breaking bones came from every part of the Herculean God of War’s body.

The Second Order Heavenly God Realm expert screamed, staring fearfully at Feng Er as if begging to stop, but the pain was too excruciating for him to speak.

The situation had changed too abruptly and too fast that Prince Chen and the rest of his cronies, as well as Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu, failed to react.

Their minds went blank at the sight they were witnessing.

The burly six feet two inches tall Second Order Heavenly God Realm Herculean God of War’s bones had gotten crushed easily under Feng Er’s tender grasp. This result was a tremendous blow to Prince Chen’s group, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu.

“Don’t kill him so fast.” Huang Xiaolong said in a nonchalant voice.

“Understood, Manor Lord.” Feng Er complied respectfully. Her slender hand grasped in the air and noises of breaking bones sounded again. The Herculean God of War fainted due to pain, but was soon awakened due to the renewed pain.

As bones broke, and crushed into pieces, his body hung limply out of shape.

Prince Chen and the rest of his cronies had turned deathly pale in a matter of seconds.

“Who are you?!” Prince Chen demanded as his senses returned. He barked at Huang Xiaolong with false bravado, “I am Chen Country’s Prince, release him this instant, or you won’t be able to escape out of Chen Country!”

At this time, the slightly pale and excited Tie Mu cried out, “Our Big brother Huang is Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple!”

“What?! A Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple!”

Upon hearing that, Prince Chen and his cronies’ attention was fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

“So, this Brother is a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple!” Prince Chen cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong in greeting and went on, “I am sworn brothers with several Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciples, and we’re all family. What happened just now is a misunderstanding, and I hope this Brother can let my subordinate go. Since Brother is a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple, then as long as Brother doesn’t interfere in the Tie Family Fort’s affairs, everything can be discussed. I am a person who loves to get to know new friends, so we can go for a drink.”

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the others erupted in another wave of laughter as Prince Chen said that he was not planning to pursue Huang Xiaolong, sticking his nose into others affairs.

Feng Er exerted force in her fingers and the Second Order Heavenly God Realm Herculean God of War’s body crackled and popped as a piercing scream cut through the air.

Seeing this,Prince Chen’s face darkened and he said sullenly to Huang Xiaolong, “What is the meaning of this? Do you really think that I won’t dare to do anything just because you’re a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple? I’m not afraid to tell you that one of my sworn brothers, who is a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple, and his Master, who is a Barbarian God Sect’s Elder, have come to my Chen Country’s capital city. So you better converge your arrogance, and release my subordinate now, before it’s too late.”

Huang Xiaolong drawled lazily, “I have never been a tactful person.”

Xu Yong suddenly raised his foot and pressed it in the air, easily kicking the rest of Prince Chen’s cronies backwards into the air. When they hit the ground, none of them were breathing.

These were all First Order and Second Order Heavenly God Realm experts.

Whereas, Prince Chen himself tumbled and rolled on the ground into the far distance, covered with dirt all over.

“You—!” Prince Chen struggled up in a sorry state. His face was deathly pale as he looked at his subordinates’ corpses around him, and when he looked back at Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t know what to say.

Huang Xiaolong casually flicked his finger, shooting a light in between Prince Chen eyebrows, and said, “You can scram now, go and tell your Barbarian God Sect’s sworn brother and his Master to come over. Don’t think of escaping, I’ve placed a mark on you, if it’s not resolved within one day, you’re dead, trust me.”

Prince Chen’s face ashened at Huang Xiaolong’s words. He had lost all his courage, and fled in a hurry.

“Let’s go back first.” Huang Xiaolong said to Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu who were standing like statues with dumbstruck expressions.

The two regained their senses, and quickly ran up to Huang Xiaolong. The scenes from a moment ago were replaying repeatedly in their minds—were all of it real? They slowly looked over their shoulders in disbelief at Prince Chen’s subordinates’ corpses. Not to mention, the Second Order Heavenly God Realm Herculean God of War who was crushed to his death by Feng Er, only his flesh, bones and blood remained scattered all over the ground.

‘It seems, this is real?!’

Their apprehensive gazes fell onto Feng Er and Xu Yong.

On the other side, Prince Chen fled all the way back to the capital city in a sorry state, and ran straight to where his Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple’s sworn brother was staying, without even stopping to clean himself.
