Chapter 59: Receive Huang Xiaolong as Personal Disciple?

Huang Xiaolong looked at Xiong Meiqi, and coldly sneered, “The new students’ assessment bet, you haven’t forgotten, right?”

Xiong Meiqi’s body trembled and there was panic in her eyes, not daring to meet Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Her face turned a pale white.

Bet? While Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu’s were still confused, the pale Xiong Meiqi suddenly knelt down. She just knelt down in the square like that, opened her small cherry like mouth, “Wang! Wang! Wang!” and she cried out three times in a row.

Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were stunned agape.

While Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu remained confused and stunned, Xiong Meiqi suddenly stood up, turned around and fled, disappearing without a trace.

All around the square were dazed faces.

Looking at the direction in which Xiong Meiqi disappeared; Huang Xiaolong felt she wasn’t as hateful as he had thought. At the very least, she dared to say and dared to do. Initially, he had thought she would surely try to wriggle out of it.

Xiong Chu looked at his daughter’s disappearing silhouette, and could only shake his head.

Due to Xiong Meiqi running away, the new students’ assessment stopped midway and did not continue.

Xiaolong and the others dispersed from the square.

Sun Zhang’s eyes flickered a he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s receding silhouette, “It looks like, within the next two days, I should make a trip to the Marshal’s Mansion, and have a chat with that old fellow Haotian!”

Having understood the meaning hidden in Sun Zhang’s words, Xiong Chu laughed and said, “Based on Principal’s good relation with Marshal Haotian, coupled with Principal’s strength and identity, I’m sure Marshal Haotian would be happy to agree to let Huang Xiaolong become Principal’s disciple.”

Sun Zhang nodded; he nodded not because he was worried (about Huang Xiaolong becoming his disciple), but because he was curious about Huang Xiaolong’s martial spirit.

That old fellow Haotian should know, right? Sun Zhang thought secretly. He was about to leave but laughed bitterly when he remembered Jiang Teng’s unconscious body, and said to Xiong Chu, “Let’s go, we should first stabilize Jiang Teng’s injury before talking about anything else.”Xiong Chu also smiled bitterly and nodded.

Thereafter, both of them carried the unconscious Jiang Teng and disappeared from the square in the blink of an eye.

Xiaolong however, went to the library instead of returning to the classroom.

The first floor of the library was opened to all Academy students, however, battle skills and cultivation techniques were kept on the second floor, third floor, and the fourth floor. Therefore, only those that had accomplished tasks issued by the Academy, and had a certain amount of contribution points were allowed to go to those floors.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t enroll into the Academy to learn their battle skills or cultivation techniques. Although he had lived in this Martial Spirit World for almost ten years, the things he understood were very little. So, he wanted to read more books to learn about this world.

After reading two books on martial spirits, Huang Xiaolong noticed a book titled ‘Supernatural Ability’ on a bookshelf.

Supernatural ability?

His curiosity was stoked, and he took the book then started to flip through the pages. The more he read, the more captivated he became. The book not only described the many different martial spirits’ supernatural abilities, but also the usage, strengths, and weaknesses. Although it wasn’t in full detail, it was enough to open a new door for Xiaolong.

A little more than an hour later, Huang Xiaolong returned the book to its rack and picked another book.

While Xiaolong was concentrating on books in the library, the entire Academy was swept by a wave of intense discussion.

“I heard today in the new students’ assessment, a new student called Huang Xiaolong nearly destroyed that student Jiang Teng who possesses a grade eleven martial spirit!”

“This is a hundred percent true! I was in the square at the time– that Huang Xiaolong suddenly exposed a peak late-Fourth Order strength!”

“The peak late-Fourth Order! How old is this Huang Xiaolong, not even ten, right? This is too terrifying!”

“I also heard that this Huang Xiaolong came to register with the Principal’s recommendation letter; previously, Jiang Teng called him a “waste” every time he opened his mouth!”

There was such discussion in every corner of the Cosmic Star Academy, regardless of whether it was an older student or teacher, they were all shocked when they heard it while at the same time, everybody was trying to guess what Huang Xiaolong’s martial spirit was.

It was near noon when Xiaolong left the library. When the older students who were present in the square that morning recognized Huang Xiaolong, they started to point and whisper with a weird expression.Xiaolong could hear the discussions around him, and he shook his head; he hadn’t expected that news in this world spread just as fast; after all, three hours had barely passed since the incident in the morning.

“Young Master!” The waiting Fei Hou and the four Marshal Mansion’s guards had seen Huang Xiaolong come out and quickly went to him greeting him as they got nearer.

Huang Xiaolong nodded then took the five of them to Tianxuan Mansion.

“Young Master, we heard you nearly wasted that Jiang Teng!” On the way, Fei Hou said.

“You all heard about it?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised and smiled bitterly.

The five of them laughed, and Fei Hou said, “That Jiang Teng was the exalted Academy genius in more than a hundred years, possessing a superb talent martial spirit and he’s also Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu’s disciple at the same time. The matter about Young Master almost turning him into a waste caused great waves that spread throughout all of Royal City!”

It even spread throughout Royal City? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong was a little astonished and frowned, but he gradually relaxed. It was useless to hide anymore– soon enough there would be people who would find out that he had a vague connection with the Marshal’s Mansion. Moreover, with Marshal Haotian’s presence, there shouldn’t be anyone who dared to make a move against him; at least, he was still safe while in the Luo Tong Kingdom’s Royal City!

Soon, they arrived at the Tianxuan Mansion.

Allowing the four guards to stand down, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou sat in the main hall where he asked Fei Hou about his progress in practicing the ‘Liquid Thunder Arts’.

Fei Hou answered with a happy face, saying, “Sovereign, your subordinate has been diligently practicing the cultivation technique that you passed down in these past few days, and my battle qi cultivation has increased exponentially!”

Based on the speed of his cultivation these past couple of days, there was no need for five years– perhaps in four years’ time he could breakthrough into the Xiantian realm.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and he asked Fei Hou about the matter regarding the purchase of slaves.

And Fei Hou reported everything in detail to Huang Xiaolong.

For the last couple of days, Fei Hou carefully selected twenty-six slaves and started to nurture them by teaching them cultivation techniques.

Listening to Fei Hou’s report, Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction.

“I’ve decided that in two days I will go and train in the Silvermoon Forest.” said Huang Xiaolong in a low but serious tone after Fei Hou was done with his report. “I should be back around the end of the year’s competition.”

“What? Sovereign, you want to go into the Silvermoon Forest to train alone?” Fei Hou’s expression changed, worried, he asked, “Sovereign, this, it’s better if this Subordinate accompanies you!”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand saying, “No need. In the upcoming five months, stay in the Tianxuan Mansion and train the slaves. Also, you must diligently practice the Liquid Thunder Arts every day.”

Fei Hou wanted to say more, but Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “Don’t say any more, I’ve decided!” With his current strength combined with his supernatural ability to conceal himself within shadows, as long as he didn’t venture too deep into the forest, there wouldn’t be much danger. Furthermore, Xiaolong didn’t want to continue relying on Fei Hou and Marshal Haotian’s power.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had made up his mind, Fei Hou could only accept the order respectfully.

While Huang Xiaolong decided to enter the Silvermoon Forest in two days’ time, on the other side of the Marshal Mansion, there was an uninvited guest – Cosmic Star Academy’s Principal, Sun Zhang!

Sun Zhang arrived in the Marshal Mansion and chatted about some miscellaneous stuff with Marshal Haotian before stating the purpose of his visit: his desire to take Huang Xiaolong as his disciple.

“What? You want to take Huang, Huang Xiaolong as your personal disciple?” Marshal Haotian was shocked, so much so that even his voice became awkward. Then, without any doubt or hesitation, shook his head and said: “No!”

What a joke, Huang Xiaolong was their Asura’s Gate Sovereign. How can a little Cosmic Star Academy’s Principal qualify to receive him as personal disciple?
