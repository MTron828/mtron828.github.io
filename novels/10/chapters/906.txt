A shiver ran down Shi Xiaofei’s petite body hearing his low whisper, the shyness of a girl was fully displayed on her delicate face. Her ears were red down to her earlobes.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s arm reached out, and before Shi Xiaofei knew it she was already leaning against his firm chest. Even through the layers of her wedding dress, Huang Xiaolong could feel Shi Xiaofei’s rising body temperature.

Aroused, his hands began to roam around.

Shi Xiaofei’s body was soft and supple, completely leaning into Huang Xiaolong as his hands teased her as he liked. However, as time passed, the pair of masculine hands lit a fire in her body everywhere they touched, causing her breathing to gradually grow heavy.

The faint scent of Shi Xiaofei’s body drilled into Huang Xiaolong’s nose.

His head lowered, after which his lips met a pair of dainty cherry red lips, sending a shiver down Shi Xiaofei’s body.

They became engrossed as their kissing deepened, as if they had blended into the heaven and earth, forgetting all else. Slowly, not knowing who or when, their clothes were peeled off and piled at their feet, leaving skin against skin. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze traced the white skin that was like translucent jade yet had a visible pinkish undertone. Her mesmerizing curves, high breasts and rounded behind, spurred the heat from Huang Xiaolong’s groin.

As for Shi Xiaofei, her sight was filled with Huang Xiaolong’s chiseled muscles, especially the enormous horizontal pillar, her face was indescribably red.

A short while later, soft moans and grunts sounded from the bridal chamber and primal desire filled the room, the yard.

Three days and three nights later, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei emerged from the bridal chamber.

When they entered the hall and saw everyone there with bloodshot eyes, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei couldn’t help turning red.

His younger brother Huang Xiaohai discreetly gave Huang Xiaolong a thumbs up.

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes and pretended not to see.

Whereas Su Yan and Huang Min quickly walked up to Shi Xiaofei, talking in low whispers. Shi Xiaofei lowered her head, her face all read.

In the blink of an eye, a month went by.

In this one month, Huang Xiaolong’s days were spent in cultivation, stimulating the four divine fires and absorbing the shimmering gray energy, while his nights were spent tumbling between the sheets with Shi Xiaofei. In between, he would bring Shi Xiaofei and his family on little trips around Martial Spirit World.

Time trickled by and another month passed.

After a month of absorbing the shimmering gray energy, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation rose significantly.

Shi Xiaofei was still a virgin on their wedding night, adding her Pure Luminance Enlightened Buddha Physique. After their coupling, Huang Xiaolong obtained a part of her yin essence, hence his cultivation speed was even faster. This improvement was even more obvious looking at Shi Xiaofei’s cultivation.

Two months after his wedding, before the Huang Family’s and Shi Xiaofei’s reluctant gazes, Huang Xiaolong left the Martial Spirit World for the City of Devils.

Before leaving, he listed a number of things that Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, Ancestor Bifang, and the other needed to pay attention to.

A day later, he had left the territory of the four galaxies.

‘According to speed of Qiu Baifei’s group, they should now be arriving at the Fortune Gate’s headquarters in the Everlasting Galaxy.’ On the way, Huang Xiaolong sneered as he thought to himself.

As predicted, not long after he left the four galaxies, Qiu Baifei’s group arrived at the Everlasting Galaxy.

The Fortune Gate Chief, Wang Yu, personally welcomed them.

No doubt, if this was any other time, with the identities of Qiu Baifei’s group members, they would never be qualified to meet the Fortune Gate’s Chief. However, when Wang Yu heard that Qiu Baifei’s group came from the Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Azure Dragon Galaxies, and most of all that they had information related to Huang Xiaolong, Wang Yu decided to ‘welcome’ this group of people personally.

“You’re saying Huang Xiaolong killed the Seventh Order Highgod Realm Yelu Chufei and Beitang Yiyang?!” Hearing Qiu Baifei’s report, Wang Yu’s expression stiffened due to shock for the briefest moment, his disbelief was obvious.

“Yes, Chief Wang.” Qiu Baifei respectfully replied, “This matter is absolutely true, this news has spread throughout the four galaxies. None of us expected Huang Xiaolong to have concealed his strength so deeply, reaching this extent.”

Wang Yu’s expression darkened visibly.

Huang Xiaolong actually had such strength? Then the one who killed their sect’s Elder Wang Zhong wasn’t someone else, but Huang Xiaolong?!

At that thought, Wang Yu’s expression grew even more sullen.

His Fortune Gate’s disciples had always maintained a strict line, guarding the border of the Eternal Galaxy and its neighboring galaxies. It was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to leave without them knowing, but now, not only had Huang Xiaolong returned to the Black Tortoise Galaxy, he had also exterminated more than half of the Yelu Family’s masters and reined in just as many Beitang Family cultivators.

‘Those groups of useless trash!’ A chilling light flickered in Wang Yu’s eyes.

“Chief Wang, that Huang Xiaolong is arrogant and overbearing in nature, not to mention lawless and reckless. He actually fantasized about conquering the four galaxies, that is why we were forced to leave our native land, hoping to be of service to the Fortune Gate.” A White Tiger Galaxy Third Order Highgod Realm family ancestor cautiously spoke.

Wang Yu finally revealed a smile, “For you to be willing to place your hopes on our Fortune Gate, submitting to us, we naturally welcome everyone. Rest assured, we will definitely capture Huang Xiaolong and torture him to death!”

Although the strength of Qiu Baifei’s group didn’t enter Wang Yu’s eyes, they were still Highgod Realm masters. Even a long heritage hegemon force like their Fortune Gate would need to spend a large amount of resources to nurture a Highgod Realm master.

Now, there were close to a thousand Highgod Realm masters willing to submit to them, Wang Yu was naturally happy.

With this, the Fortune Gate’s power would rise by another level.

The kneeling Highgod Realm masters from the four galaxies rose to their feet, thanking Chief Wang. Subsequently, Wang Yu had one of the Fortune Gate’s Grand Elders arrange cultivation grounds for Qiu Baifei’s group.

However, just as he planned to send someone to capture Huang Xiaolong, a disciple ran inside reporting that Huang Xiaolong had already left the Black Tortoise Galaxy and was heading to the City of Devils.

Of course, this news was deliberately released by Huang Xiaolong.

After Wang Yu heard this report, he sneered, “Huang Xiaolong ah Huang Xiaolong, since it’s like that I’ll have my Fortune Gate Grand Elders prepare to welcome you at the gates of the City of Devils.”

Thus, Wang Yu took out his communication talisman to contact the Fortune Gate’s Branch Grand Elders located in the City of Devils, having them prepare well to ‘welcome’ Huang Xiaolong.

Following that, Wang Yu gathered a group of thirty people consisting of Seventh Order, Eighth Order, and Ninth Order Highgod Realm masters, sending them to Martial Spirit World with the absolute order of capturing all the Huang Clan Manor’s people alive, especially Huang Xiaolong’ woman, Shi Xiaofei!

Watching those thirty people leave, Wang Yu let out a hearty laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, you’ll reunite with your family and woman very soon in the City of Devils.”

Due to the distance between the Black Tortoise Galaxy and City of Devils, even if Huang Xiaolong used Greater Space Teleportation consecutively in between transmission arrays, it still took him three months before reaching his destination.

In those three months, he continued absorbing the gray energy to cultivate as he traveled, narrowing his cultivation to peak late-Fourth Order Highgod Realm.

According to his estimation, he would be able to step into peak late-Fourth Order Highgod Realm in two months if he continued at this rate.

Looking at the enormous city that stood in the middle of space, the tall city walls and devil qi roiling above the City of Devils, Huang Xiaolong subconsciously accelerated.

A short while later, he was standing in front of the city gates.
