Chapter 108: What, Do You Dare to Do Something To Me?

That guard hesitated a moment before reporting truthfully: “He was been beaten by Yang Zhanfei!”

“Yang Zhanfei!”

Those in the main hall were shocked, and the angry expression on Fei Rong’s face diminished a level.

Huang Xiaolong noticed the unfavorable expressions in the main hall, and could not help but ask, “Who is this Yang Zhanfei?”

Fei Hou replied respectfully: “Yang Zhanfei is that Yang An’s younger brother!”

“Yang An?” This relation was out of Huang Xiaolong’s expectations.

That number one monstrous genius of the Yuwai Kingdom, Yang An? On the way here, the name he heard the most number of times was this Yang An. He did not expect that Yang Zhanfei would be Yang An’s younger brother!

“Where is your Young Master now?” Huang Xiaolong turned to ask that Fei Mansion guard.

Fei Hou, Fei Rong, and the rest also turned to look at the guard.

The guard quickly replied: “At the Thousand Virtues Street!”

“Thousand Virtues Street?” Huang Xiaolong shifted his gaze onto Fei Hou, “How far is this Thousand Virtues Street from the Fei Mansion?”

“It is just three streets away, not far!” Fei Hou promptly answered.

“Let us hurry over and see.” Huang Xiaolong stood up.

Subsequently, under Fei Hou, Fei Rong, and the Patriarchs’ lead, Huang Xiaolong and the group showed up at Thousand Virtues Street a short while later. What welcomed them was the view of a group of people encircling another group in the middle. The encircling group was laughing, mocking and pointing, having a merry time judging from the expressions on their faces.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group neared the center, an arrogant loud voice sounded: “Your mother, with this ugly face of yours you think you’re worthy of Tao Zhe? Don’t assume your Fei Mansion is almighty; in my eyes, the Fei Mansion is nothing at all!”

“Let me tell you, Fei Ming, today this father beat you up, so what! What does your Fei Mansion dare to do? That Dad of yours is also nothing but a toothless tiger!”

The encircling crowd broke out in raucous laughter.

Obviously, it came from that Yang Zhanfei’s servants and guards he brought with him.

“Yang Zhanfei, I’ll fight you to the death!” A furious roar cut through the noises.

And seconds later, a painful scream ensued.

Fei Rong’s face paled hearing that voice. Anger and wrath erupted inside his heart, the Fei Mansion guards sprinted into the encirclement, breaking it and scattering the crowd away. Huang Xiaolong and the rest saw a twenty-five or twenty-six-year-old young man lying on the street with blood stains on his face while a beautiful young girl in her early twenties tried to lift the young man up with a worried face. At the same time, her face contained fury glaring at another young man dressed in golden brocade robe opposite them, not far away.

This beautiful young woman should be Tao Zhe and that young man in golden brocade robe – Yang Zhanfei.

“Fei Ming, how bad is it?” Tao Zhe propped Fei Ming up and anxiously asked.

Fei Ming only shook his head.

At this time, the Fei Mansion guards had already cut a path through the crowd and Fei Rong was seen rushing up front.

“Dad!” Fei Ming called out seeing Fei Rong, but as his voice landed, his eyes caught sight of another silhouette behind Fei Rong; surprised, his voice trembled when he cried out: “Grandfather!”

“Grandfather, you’re back!” Ignoring his injuries, Fei Ming hastened precariously towards Fei Hou.

Fei Hou nodded and flashed an affectionate smile as he quickly took over holding up his grandson up and checking the extent of his injuries. Fei hou let out a breath of relief. His grandson’s injuries weren’t as bad as it looked; it seems that Yang Zhanfei still had a sense of proportion.

Yang Zhanfei was greatly shocked within when he saw Fei Hou; an old man that had disappeared for so many years actually came back? He knew Fei Hou was a peak late-Tenth Order.

“Hey, hey, the Fei Mansion guards’ action is quite efficient– even the Patriarch came!” Yang Zhanfei’s poisonous tongue wagged. “Don’t worry, that Fei Ming’s life is in no danger! But he might not be so lucky next time.” He looked at Fei Ming as he spoke these words, “When you see me in the future, hide far away, otherwise, I will beat you up every time I see you!”

“We’re leaving!” Yang Zhanfei motioned with a hand wave, signaling the servant and guards behind him.

“Stop!” Just when Yang Zhanfei was about to leave with his servants and guards, a loud snarled resounded.

Yang Zhanfei’s leg paused inches above the ground, his head looked back and saw the one who spoke was Fei Hou.

Fei Hou slowly stepped towards the young man.

If he allowed this young man to pat his ass and leave just like that, then the Fei Mansion wouldn’t face any face to show in the Yuwai Royal City anymore!

Yang Zhanfei calmly looked on as Fei Hou approached him slowly, “You are Fei Hou? You want to avenge your grandson?” Saying this, his eyes swept through the numbers of Fei Mansion guards, “You want to bully us, having fewer people?”

Fei Hou opened his mouth about to answer, suddenly, Huang Xiaolong appeared next to him, “As long as you can take one palm from me, we’ll allow you to leave.”

Yang Zhanfei glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong, but all of a sudden, a smile emerged on his face “Kid, what did you say? Take one palm from you? Repeat it again, this father didn’t understand clearly.”

The servants and guards behind Yang Zhanfei broke out in laughter whereas Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent.

“Kid, where did a kid that hasn’t weaned milk like you run out from, can you even make decisions?” Yang Zhanfei said after he managed to stop laughing.

“He is my Young Lord, his meaning is my meaning!” At this time, Fei Hou interjected.

Young Lord?!

Yang Zhanfei was dumbstruck looking at Huang Xiaolong when he heard Fei Hou’s words, and he was greatly surprised.

Fei Hou actually referred to this teenage boy as Young Lord!

The servants and guards behind Yang Zhanfei were also observing Huang Xiaolong with shock in their eyes.

Getting over his shock, Yang Zhanfei coldly said, “Since it is like this, I also want to see how you can defeat me with just one palm!” A cruel light glinted across Yang Zhanfei’s pupils.

Although Fei Hou referred to Huang Xiaolong as Young Lord, which greatly shook his heart, he did not take Huang Xiaolong seriously. Or it was more accurate to say, he’d never put a sixteen-year-old kid in his eyes, much less defeat him with just one palm!

At this point, the crowd sensibly retreated back. Yang Zhanfei and Huang Xiaolong stood in the middle with waves of energies fluctuating in the air.

The crowd’s focus was entirely on the two figures in the middle, especially Fei Rong. His eyes followed Huang Xiaolong tightly as he wanted to know Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

What does this young man have that made Father acknowledged him as Lord?!

“Dad, he is?” Fei Ming asked Fei Rong, pointing at Huang Xiaolong. Just now, his Grandfather actually acknowledged in public that young man is his Young Lord and the shock and surprise he felt were much stronger compared to Fei Rong.

“Are you ready?” Huang Xiaolong asked in a nonchalant manner as he looked at the opposite side.

Yang Zhanfei suddenly dashed out, making a sneak attack ㅡ his fist punched towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest. The attack arrived almost instantly in front of Huang Xiaolong and countless starlight shone like pillars as a discernable, holy aura spread out from the center.

Everyone present was startled for none of them imagined Yang Zhanfei would launch a sneak attack.

Including Fei Rong.

“Careful!” Fei Ming blurted out in anxiousness– that Yang Zhanfei is a peak late-Seventh Order.

When everyone thought Yang Zhanfei’s attack would hit the mark, Huang Xiaolong made his move. He raised one of his hands and slammed out an attack against the fist.

“Boom!” A loud explosion reverberated in the air.

Yang Zhanfei wailed tragically, flying out and crashing heavily onto the streets, causing the entire street to shake.

One palm!

Not one person dared to utter gasps of surprise loudly.

Fei Rong was stupefied whereas Fei Ming who shouted for Huang Xiaolong to be careful was transfixed on the spot with his mouth the shape of an ‘O’.

The servants and guards that came with Yang Zhanfei were so scared they forgot to help Yang Zhanfei up from the ground.

Huang Xiaolong slowly walked towards Yang Zhanfei, the latter had fear written all over his face; his butt scraped the street surface in horror, “You, you, what do you want to do?!”

“What do I want to do?” Huang Xiaolong stopped in front of him.
