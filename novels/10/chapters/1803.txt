As people started to kneel down in waves, even ancestors and patriarchs of superpowers began to get to their knees.

The darkness seemed to cover the plaza as everyone fell to their knees.

Even Mo Xiao and Peng Yi didn’t remain standing when they saw the King of Grandmist.

His appearance alone demonstrated his prestige. It was something no one could challenge!

The King of Grandmist wasn’t just Jiang Hong’s master. He wasn’t only an expert who had the same seniority as the Ancient Heavenly Ancestor. Neither was he a mere existence who had surpassed the Emperor Realm.

In the annals of time, there were plenty of Emperors who had failed to outrun the calling of time. There had been several calamities that had struck the Divine World, and every single time, the King of Grandmist had appeared to save the day. It could be said that without his help, the Divine World wouldn’t exist.

The reverence everyone had for the King of Grandmist superseded even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor.

Even if Di Jun was the current Heavenly Emperor, he had to bow when he saw the King of Grandmist. As for the ancestors and Emperor Realm experts... they could only kneel in his presence.

Before the King of Grandmist, everyone was a junior!

In the end, even members of the Brightness Emperor Palace and Fiend God Emperor Palace got to their knees.

In the entire plaza, there were only three figures left standing.

Huang Xiaolong and the two beasts behind him were the only ones not on their knees.

Of course, the anomaly was quickly detected by everyone present, and all of them stared blankly at Huang Xiaolong.

A sneer formed on Di Jun’s face as he had never expected Huang Xiaolong to act so brazenly, even in the presence of the King of Grandmist.

In Di Jun’s mind, Huang Xiaolong was courting death!

Huang Xiaolong ah Huang Xiaolong, you dare to offend Esteemed Senior, the King of Grandmist... It seems as though no one in the world will be able to save you now.

Huang Xiaolong flew into the air before anyone had the chance to react. Since his master was here, he couldn’t continue the fight, could he?

He flew straight towards the King of Grandmist.

Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, Bei Xiaomei, and the others watched as Huang Xiaolong soared closer and closer towards the King of Grandmist, and they felt their hearts tighten. Even the usually brazen Bei Xiaomei didn’t dare to open her mouth to stop him. She had dared to run her mouth off in the presence of Di Jun, but she didn’t dare to show any disrespect to the King of Grandmist.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was approaching the King of Grandmist with his ‘blind arrogance,’ Han Qing from the Grandmist Emperor Palace rose to her feet and screamed with blind rage, “Huang Xiaolong! How dare you?! How dare you refuse to kneel in the presence of the King of Grandmist?! You better get to your knees and beg for mercy now!”

The King of Grandmist was Jiang Hong’s master, and he was the strongest backing of the Grandmist Emperor Palace. She naturally wanted to put up a good show in front of her higher-ups in the palace.

Huang Xiaolong ignored her as though she didn’t exist as he continued to make his way towards the King of Grandmist.

When Han Qing saw how arrogant Huang Xiaolong was acting, she couldn’t hold the rage in her heart any longer.

Just as she was about to scream at him again, Huang Xiaolong arrived before the King of Grandmist, and he mirrored Di Jun’s actions. He bowed and laughed, “Master, you’re here!”

A single, harmless sentence seemed to contain within it the might of the strongest bomb anyone could imagine. Huang Xiaolong’s voice pierced through the hearts of everyone, and it etched itself into their souls!

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, and all of them felt as though their bodies were trembling in disbelief.

Di Jun’s body started to shake, and an indescribable expression appeared on his face.

Chen Wenqian, Liu Yuan, Gudu Wuyi, Chen Jianwei, and the others felt panic settling in their hearts.

Zhao Lei stood rooted to his spot, and the faces of everyone in the Fortune Emperor Palace changed. They felt their jaws dropping to the ground.

Han Qing, who wanted to berate Huang Xiaolong, stood frozen to her spot as her eyes widened to the size of lanterns. As though a terrifying demon had appeared before her, her face lost all color as her body started to twitch. She couldn’t stop herself, no matter how hard she tried.

She felt as though she had lost control of her body!

The heavens and earth fell into a deathly silence.

Even the disciples and ancestors who had cried due to their reverence for the King of Grandmist shut their mouth. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The air seemed to have turned heavier, and everyone found it harder to breathe.

The King of Grandmist looked at Huang Xiaolong, and a pleasant smile appeared on his face. “I have been here since the start. I didn’t want to interfere in your battle. Anyway, I’m honored to have you as my disciple.”

A doting look appeared in the King of Grandmist’s eyes. Pride welled up inside him as he was delighted to have been able to accept Huang Xiaolong as his disciple.

Even the Grandmist Emperor, Jiang Hong, hadn’t caused him to swell up with so much pride when he was accepted as a new disciple. However, Huang Xiaolong, who hadn’t even broken through to the Emperor Realm, was different!

Without a doubt, the King of Grandmist had left seclusion to spectate Huang Xiaolong’s battle. For someone like the King of Grandmist, who was cultivating in seclusion for billions of years, appearing to watch Huang Xiaolong’s battle personally—his preference for this disciple of his was clear as the day.

Han Qing, Gudu Wuyi, Chen Jianwei, and the others felt the blood drain from their face.

Huang Xiaolong snickered and turned to Jiang Hong. “Senior Brother...”

Jiang Hong almost burst out laughing. “Junior brother, you really made Master and Senior Azure Cow worried during the battle... None of us thought that you would be in the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm with terrifying combat strength...”

Huang Xiaolong could only lower his head sheepishly.

Everyone felt another shockwave running through their heart as they turned to look at the azure cow beside the King of Grandmist.

What did the Grandmist Emperor just say?! Senior Azure Cow?! Is he talking about that cow beside the King of Grandmist?

Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, Bei Xiaomei, and even Elder Fu were stunned silly. The little cow had changed her appearance before coming out, and none of them managed to recognize her when she stood beside the King of Grandmist.

The moment Jiang Hong revealed her identity, all of them identified her.

“That... That’s the little cow?!” Bei Xiaomei opened her mouth wide, and she stared at the little cow in shock. Did the Grandmist Emperor just refer to her as Senior Azure Cow?!

Even Di Jun looked at the little cow standing beside the King of Grandmist, and he seemed to have thought of a terrifying event as his expression drooped. He cupped his fist and asked, “Are you really Senior Azure Cow?”

When everyone saw how Di Jun was acting, the shock in their heart increased once again.
