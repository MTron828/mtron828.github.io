Chapter 3693 – That Looks Like the Nefarious Golden Master!

Devil qi pervaded the lands and Huang Xiaolong casually grabbed a ball of devil qi with a swing of his arms. The ball of devil qi rolled about as though it had a consciousness of its own.

“The devil qi is an extremely pure form of spiritual energy!” Huang Xiaolong gasped.

Zhu Chen chuckled, “The Devil Land is the place with the purest spiritual qi in the Unknown Space! Not even the Green Ghost Land can compare to it!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

After standing there for some time, Huang Xiaolong exhaled, “Allright. Let’s go to the Devil Capital.”

The Devil Capital was the largest city in the Devil Land. It was also the core of the Devil Race.

As the region owned by the strongest expert in the Unknown Space, it was naturally the place where the strongest gathered.

The Ferocious Devil’s combat strength had passed the 29 billion mark. One could only imagine how terrifying he was!

Several months passed…

Huang Xiaolong and the others finally arrived in the Devil Capital.

The Devil Capital stood in the middle of a mountain range. It spanned god knew how many miles, and it was covered in a dense cloud of devil qi. It emitted mysterious air.

Keeping the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong and the others approached the city gates.

The city was bustling and there were disciples of the great devil sects walking about casually.

Huang Xiaolong and the others walked about the city as they slowly made their way over to the imperial palace.

According to the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death, the Ferocious Devil’s son, Mo Kun, might have an idea.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others were traveling over, a commotion broke out in the city.

“The Heaven Secret Devil Prince and the Wavering Light Prince are fighting!”

“Hahaha! It’s normal!”

“Let’s run! The shockwaves of the battle are bound to sweep us up! If we get caught up in the battle, we’re in trouble!”

“In the past, there was an eminent elder of a certain family who was beaten up. The two races couldn’t come to an agreement for his compensation, and they beat him up again!”

The experts in the surrounding started to flee at the quickest speed possible.

“Heaven Secret Devil Race? Wavering Light Devil Race?” Huang Xiaolong turned to ask the rest.

One of the region masters approached and explained, “Lord, the ancestors of the two races are ordinary half step Universe Gods.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

That meant that their grand cosmos energy hadn’t crossed the 10 billion mark.

They might be existences akin to the heavens in the eyes of ordinary experts, but they were nothing more than tiny little ants to everyone in Huang Xiaolong’s party.

When Huang Xiaolong realized who they were, the battle started to progress over to their side.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the scuffle and he chuckled towards the Dragon Overlord and the others, “Why don’t you go warm up your muscles?”

They stared at each other and laughed.

A rare smile appeared on the God of Death’s face. “Forget it… If we go up there, we can’t even breathe properly for fear of killing them.

Laughter filled the skies once again.

When they were in the midst of laughter, the princes arrived before Huang Xiaolong and the others.

As they didn’t care about their surroundings, a massive hurricane was swept up near Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Of course, the shockwaves and storm dissipated before they could run through Huang Xiaolong and the others.

When they approached Huang Xiaolong, they were sent flying by a wave of formless energy.

Eating a mouthful of dirt, they finally stopped their fight.

The experts who followed them around quickly went up to the two when they saw that the battle came to a pause.

The Heaven Secret Prince stared at Huang Xiaolong and the others as he harrumphed, “Whoever you are, you better get lost!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong looked at the Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen as they failed to hold back their laughter.

“Brat, are you really asking us to scram?!” The Dragon Overlord held his stomach as he doubled over with laughter.

The Wavering Light Prince looked at the Heaven Secret Prince before looking at the various disciples who were watching the farce and he turned to the Dragon Overlord and he roared, “You’ll die a horrible death if you refuse to get out of our way! F*ck off!”

This time, even the region masters behind Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter.

“Take them down! Beat them until their mothers wouldn’t recognize them!” The Wavering Light Prince roared at the experts standing behind him.

As the members of the Wavering Light Devil Race were three times the size of a regular human, they looked extremely intimidating as they charged towards Huang Xiaolong’s group. All of them were Dao Venerables who had comprehended more than ten elements and they were pretty strong.

When they approached, they were sent flying by a surge of grand cosmos energy. When they landed on the ground, no one was left conscious.

Everyone who saw what happened sucked in a cold breath.

The Wavering Light Prince’s expression changed.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at him and he muttered, “Brat, if you really want to kill us all, you need to send stronger experts over.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about their reaction as he left after speaking.

The members of the two races could feel the weird stares all around and their expressions turned ugly.

“Who are they? How dare they offend the members of the Wavering Light Devil Race?”

“How would I know? But if they dare to offend the Wavering Light Devil Race, they shouldn’t be too weak!”

“That… That… Doesn’t that look like the Nefarious Golden Master?!” Someone spotted the Nefarious Golden Master at the back and he screamed, “I went to the Nefarious Golden Land in the past and I saw his statue!”

The experts standing around him roared with laughter when they heard what he said.

“What the f*ck are you talking about? Do you hear yourself?! There are many people who look alike! Moreover, you only saw a statue in the past!”

“Why don’t you call the young man Lord Green Ghost? Hahaha!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard their discussion.

Of course, he didn’t bother correcting them. He made his way to the imperial palace and they arrived after half a day.

When the captain of the guards standing at the entrance saw the incoming group, he didn’t dare to be careless and he asked respectfully, “Can I help you?”

The Dragon Overlord casually tossed over a golden plaque that had a carving of a giant golden dragon. The plaque emitted a majestic universe aura.

The guard captain who caught it stared at the Dragon Overlord in shock.

“I am the Dragon Overlord. Call Emperor Mo Kun out here.”

What?!

“Lord… Lord Dragon!” The guard captain felt the blood draining from his face and his hands trembled, causing the plaque to fall. When he realized what he had done, fear filled his heart.

Right before the plaque could touch the ground, Huang Xiaolong grabbed it and he handed it over to the captain. “Go make your report.”
