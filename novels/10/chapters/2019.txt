Chapter 2020: King of Darkness’ Revival

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the Heart of Darkness, and he nearly jumped in fright. Waves of darkness energy poured out from the Heart of Darkness, and it seemed as though it was about to fly out of the palace.

If not for the little cow’s suppression, he was afraid that the Heart of Darkness would have already disappeared.

“Quick! Form the body!” When the little cow saw how Huang Xiaolong was staring at the heart in stunned silence, she screamed at him. “If this heart leaves the sacrificial table, the King of Darkness might wake up on his own! If that happens, he might lose control and start another killing spree!”

Huang Xiaolong snapped back to attention when he heard what she said. He knew that he needed to create the body as quickly as possible, and he hastily flew towards the sacrificial table. He activated the Heart of Hell once again, and a trace of dark energy slammed down towards the table.

When the King of Darkness had made the sacrificial table in the past, he had inscribed tons of restrictions on it. Now that the restrictions were fully activated, even a Second Order Sovereign like Elan wouldn’t be able to break through them.

When Huang Xiaolong saw that his energy was unable to pierce through the restrictions, the thought of summoning the Heavenly Hall appeared in his head. But before he could do so, the little cow snorted, and her body rose into the air. Her feet smashed towards the restrictions, and no matter how strong they seemed to be, the restrictions eventually shattered.

Even though the sacrificial table was extremely sturdy, it was only powered by the Heart of Darkness. Without an actual body, the Heart of Darkness was no match for the little cow.

Huang Xiaolong saw the restrictions shattering, and he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He didn’t hesitate, and he circulated the darkness energy in his Heart of Hell. Boundless might poured towards the Heart of Darkness situated on the sacrificial table.

The Heart of Hell was the origin of the darkness in Hell. Now that it had absorbed the darkness energy from the Lotus of Darkness, it had become the overlord of all darkness. No matter the strength of the resistance from the sacrificial table, it couldn’t stop the darkness energy coming from the Heart of Hell.

As soon as the energy from the Heart of Hell descended, it wrapped itself around the Heart of Darkness.

The heart trembled, and it shattered the ball of energy around it.

Huang Xiaolong tried countless times, but he failed to do anything to the Heart of Darkness.

“Let me help!” The little cow snorted, and she opened her mouth to spit out a ball of lightning. The ball of lightning blasted away the energy coming from the Heart of Darkness.

The darkness energy from Huang Xiaolong’s Heart of Hell quickly seeped into the Heart of Darkness. The instant it entered, Huang Xiaolong could feel the tyrannical strength the Heart of Darkness possessed. In the space inside the Heart of Darkness, darkness energy formed its own world.

Is this the accumulation of the King of Darkness before his body was destroyed?

The space inside the Heart of Darkness was too vast. Even though the Heart of Hell was the overlord of all darkness, the difference in strength between Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness was too large. The energy Huang Xiaolong could produce with his Heart of Hell was like a drop of water in the ocean compared to the Heart of Darkness’s energy.

Forcing his way forward, Huang Xiaolong tried to look for the source of the King of Darkness’s soul. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As long as he could subdue the King of Darkness’s soul thread, he would be able to control the King of Darkness after he revived. If he allowed the King of Darkness to return to life naturally, the King of Darkness might go crazy and attack the little cow and him immediately.

Days passed as Huang Xiaolong explored the space within the Heart of Darkness.

The space was really too large, and a frown slowly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. If he didn’t think of another method, he might not be able to find the soul strand even if he looked around for several years.

“I’ll teach you an ancient soul searching method!” The little cow realized the problem, and she quickly found a solution. Lightning flashed in her eyes, and it slowly entered the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows. She imprinted the technique straight into Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

After he digested the way to perform the technique, Huang Xiaolong hastily tried it out.

The darkness energy from his Heart of Hell started to fluctuate, and rays of light pierced through the space in the Heart of Darkness. As Huang Xiaolong circulated the technique unceasingly, the area that lit up became larger and larger.

One mile, two miles... ten miles...

After half a day, the light extended to a radius of more than ten million miles, and Huang Xiaolong managed to locate the King of Darkness’ soul strand.

A wave of happiness washed over his heart, and he instantly locked on to the soul strand. Circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, a purple light burning in his eyes, Grandmist worms appeared in his palms, and they quickly fused to form a mini purple dragon. They charged towards the soul strand and wrapped it up tightly.

Half a year passed...

All of a sudden, blinding light burst out from the Heart of Darkness as though a dark star was born. Vitality filled the Heart of Darkness.

A sigh of relief left Huang Xiaolong’s lips.

With the little cow’s assistance, he finally managed to subdue the Heart of Darkness. The grandmist worms he had summoned finally fused with the heart.

Right now, he no longer needed to dread facing an uncontrollable King of Darkness. The King of Darkness wouldn’t be able to devour him after awakening.

The Heart of Darkness stopped pumping all of a sudden as it fell silent.

If there was anyone who was more relieved than Huang Xiaolong, it was the little cow. She wiped the sweat off her brows, and she complained, “D*mn it! This old cow is exhausted! I would rather fight with Old Monster Lun Zhuan than do this again!”

“No no no, this time, you need to reward me properly! I want a hundred bottles of Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled and retrieved a hundred bottles without the slightest hesitation. He threw them over to her with a smile on his face. When she saw how easily she had managed to obtain a hundred bottles of Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills, a sinister smile appeared on her face. “I should have asked for two hundred bottles!”

Huang Xiaolong stared at the Heart of Darkness and ignored her. Even though the most important step was already done, he couldn’t be careless. Otherwise, he would have wasted all his efforts.

He took out a single Angel Soul Jade Divine Pill and swallowed it, recovering the godforce in his body. Only when he returned to his peak state did he circulate the darkness energy in the Heart of Hell to form a body for the King of Darkness.

With the assistance of the Heart of Hell, the Heart of Darkness resumed its beating. Resplendent rays of light emerged every time it contracted. With the Heart of Hell as the origin, the body slowly formed. The chest formed first, followed by the skull, and his arms formed next.

As the body slowly formed, his legs grew out to complete it.

A perfect body that emitted boundless pressure appeared before the man and cow duo.

The body that appeared was the body that the King of Darkness had possessed in the past. Huang Xiaolong had used the memories in the Heart of Darkness to construct the exact same body the King of Darkness had previously.

When the body was finally completed, the soul strand appeared and entered the King of Darkness’s mind. After a short while, the King of Darkness slowly opened his eyes. As soon as they opened, the world was plunged into darkness once again.

The world only returned to its original form after ten breaths of time.

Rising slowly from the sacrificial table, the King of Darkness swept his gaze over to stare at the little cow. A frosty light flashed through them. “Old Ancestor Azure Cow!”

Even though he was under Huang Xiaolong’s control, he could remember everything that had happened in the past.

“Hehe, little brat, why do you look like you’re suffering from constipation? Let’s see... We haven’t met in so many years. Why don’t you greet me with a smile?” The little cow felt the corners of her lips arching upwards, and she nearly roared with laughter.
