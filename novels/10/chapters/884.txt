“Let him in.” Huang Xiaolong answered. He was waiting to see what this Fortune Gate Elder named Wang Zhong was going to say.

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong, Feng Yang, and the others saw a burly middle-aged man striding into the front hall in a brutish manner. He was square face, had thick messy brows, and exuded a sharp prickling aura.

The instant Wang Zhong stepped into the hall, his cold, hostile gaze locked onto Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, I bet you didn’t expect me to show up so fast, right? However, even if you managed to escape from this Aeon City, you wouldn’t be able to leave the Eternal Galaxy, therefore, I advise you to nip any hope you have in the bud.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Wang Zhong with cold indifference, “The Fortune Gate sent a dog that only knows how to bark madly?”

Wang Zhong was taken aback for a second, then anger swirled in his heart. Huang Xiaolong actually dared to scold him, calling him a dog?

“Punk, you’re seeking death!” Wang Zhong let out a furious bellow and his aura spiked up in an instant. Before anyone else could react, Wang Zhong’s palm struck out toward Huang Xiaolong. The palm force exuded powerful metal element godforce, quickly arriving in front of its target.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even look at Wang Zhong, he merely struck out a palm to meet the incoming attack. Similarly, he only used metal element godforce.

Two palms collided in midair, resulting in a booming blast that shook the entire hall. The resulting shockwave pulverized the furniture inside the hall and caused the tiles to fly into the air before being reduced to dust as well. Feng Yang, Liu Yun, Chen Yang, and Qi Wen were forced away from Huang Xiaolong and Wang Zhong, their faces ashen.

Wang Zhong’s figure wobbled unsteadily, staggering several meters back. When he steadied himself, shock and disbelief were written all over his face as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, “This, you, how can this be?!” He was an early Sixth Order Highgod Realm!

Whereas that punk in front of him was just a peak early Third Order Highgod Realm ant!

The corner of Huang Xiaolong’s lips curved into a cold sneer, “Do you have anything else to say? If not, you can get the hell out.”

Get the hell out?!

Wang Zhong’s face was red, then became purple like an eggplant. His eyes were bulging from the unspeakable fury that had reached a breaking point. His hands clenched into fists as suffocating killing intent filled the hall.

Huang Xiaolong merely watched him with the same indifference.

All of a sudden, Wang Zhong’s murderous aura disappeared, converged internally as he spoke, “Huang Xiaolong, you killed my Junior Brother. Originally, according to our Fortune Gate Grand Elders’ decision, your punishment was to have all your bones broken, your tendons extracted, and be flayed alive before refining your soul and ending your life, using your head as an offering to my Junior Brother. However, as long as you hand over all the rewards you received and sign an eternal blood contract to serve our Fortune Gate, we can spare your life!”

“What? Hand over the rewards?!” Feng Yang and the others exclaimed in anger hearing that.

This Fortune Gate had gone beyond bullying!

Among Huang Xiaolong’s rewards for winning the first place in the tournament was the godhead of a Heavenly God, something that couldn’t be bought regardless of how many sacred grade immortal spirit stones or Heavenly God divine pellets one had, even less so that lightning beast egg with as top ranked bloodline, as well as the token that guaranteed enrollment into any prominent sect of the Divine World!

And this Fortune Gate also wanted Huang Xiaolong to sign an eternal blood contract! In other words, Huang Xiaolong was to become the Fortune Gate’s slave until his last breath!

Huang Xiaolong smirked, “And if I refuse?”

Wang Zhong flashed Huang Xiaolong a sinister grin, “Refuse? You’d do better to think it real good through that head of yours before answering. If you don’t agree, not only you yourself will disappear from this world, everything and everyone related to you will also die because of you.”

“There’s nothing to reconsider.”

Wang Zhong’s eyes narrowed, veiling the coldness in his eyes, “Since it’s like that, I hope you won’t regret it when the time comes.” Throwing this sentence, he turned around to leave.

The Fortune Gate’s upper echelon’s original purpose in sending over Wang Zhong was to capture Huang Xiaolong and bring him back to the headquarters all the way in the Everlasting Galaxy had he refused their terms. However, Huang Xiaolong’s strength was out of Wang Zhong’s expectations. He had no confidence in being able to capture Huang Xiaolong, hence he decided to leave first and report this matter to his superiors.

“Not so fast.” Wang Zhong barely turned around when Huang Xiaolong’s voice sounded: “Did I allow you to leave?”

Wang Zhong halted, then burst into laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, I admit you’re strong, but do you really think a Third Order Highgod Realm like you can kill a Sixth Order Highgod Realm master like me? I can come and go as I please!”

Exactly at this moment, Huang Xiaolong’s body transformed with a sway, turning into a thousand zhang long blue primordial divine dragon, exuding majestic dragon might that locked onto the mansion. At the same time, a dragon claw slammed down.

Everything happened in a split second. While Wang Zhong was still caught in the shock of Huang Xiaolong’s sudden transformation into a primordial divine dragon, an enormous dragon claw resembling a small mountain was already falling on him from above.

Wang Zhong became deathly pale, his heart falling into despair.

“NO—!”

He screamed in fear, every last strand of godforce inside his body roiled as his palms struck messily at the dragon claw.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claw easily dispersed all the attacks, which didn’t even slow his speed.

Rumble! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The hall quaked violently in protest.

The floor beneath Wang Zhong’s feet cracked, his body buried vertically into the ground below, with his flesh ruptured and blood spurting out. His breath was wheezing out without going in.

Feng Yang, Liu Yun, Qi Wen, and Chen Yang were stupefied looking at the overwhelming primordial divine blue dragon in the air, their expressions were a sight to behold.

In a flash, Huang Xiaolong reverted back to normal, standing right above Wang Zhong in the air. A suction force came from Huang Xiaolong’s hand, pulling Wang Zhong out from the ground. At the same time, his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power came to life.

All of Wang Zhong’s blood essence and godforce flooded into Huang Xiaolong’s body, causing Wang Zhong’s body to shrink rapidly as his life force ebbed away, turning into a dried corpse.

In no more than a dozen breaths’ time, Huang Xiaolong was finished with Wang Zhong, letting the dried corpse fall as he shot a sliver of fire element godforce onto it, burning it to ashes.

“Master, let’s leave.” Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder, saying to the stupefied Feng Yang.

Only then did Feng Yang and his three disciples come to their senses, hurrying after Huang Xiaolong. Even after stepping out of the Surging Waves Mansion, the four of them still felt as if they were in a dream.

A short while later, the five of them had exited the Eternal City, rushing back to Black Tortoise Galaxy.

...

The Everlasting Galaxy, Fortune Gate’s headquarters.

As the Fortune Gate Chief Wang Yu and a group of Grand Elders and Elders were discussing the aftermath of Fang Chu’s death, a flustered overseer ran into the hall, half panting as he reported that Wang Zhong’s life strip had shattered.

“What?! Wang Zhong is dead?!” Grand Elder Sun Yi jumped to his feet in anger. This Sun Yi was both Wang Zhong’s and Fang Chu’s Master.

Wang Yu and the others present were flabbergasted hearing the report. Wang Zhong was the very person they had sent to capture Huang Xiaolong, but now, he was dead! Then...?

“Could that Huang Xiaolong have other masters at his side?” A Grand Elder voiced the question everyone was thinking about.

“Not necessarily, maybe Wang Zhong was killed by some other force’s master.” Another Grand Elder suggested a different possibility.

The look in Wang Yu’s eyes grew chilling, “We’ll know everything once we captured Huang Xiaolong. Pass my order down, have people guard the galaxies surrounding the Eternal Galaxy, they must absolutely capture Huang Xiaolong and bring him back here for me!”

All present Grand Elders respectfully acknowledged.

Slightly over a month later, Huang Xiaolong’s group of five arrived back in the Black Tortoise Galaxy without any mishap. Even while rushing back, Huang Xiaolong did not relax, seizing every minute he could to cultivate.

The one hundred Heavenly God Pills refined by Heavenly God masters, as well one those one hundred All-spirit Divine Fruits that Huang Xiaolong received were all refined by him. Not only that, more than half of the pills he had collected from the Lightning God’s cultivation dwelling also went into his stomach. With these supplements, Huang Xiaolong finally advanced to mid-Third Order Highgod Realm.

Back in the Black Tortoise Galaxy, the five of them stepped out from the Cloudsea Mainland’s transmission array and headed straight to the Black Warrior Institute.
