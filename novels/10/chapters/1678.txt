Huang Xiaolong flew several rounds around the Heaven Dome Manor without restraint.

Regardless of whether they were in the air or on land, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin would leave behind a trail of scarlet flame wherever it went. It would only extinguish itself after a long period of time.

As a grandmist divine beast who possessed a royal bloodline, the speed, strength, defense, and even the attacking power of the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin far surpassed ordinary divine beasts.

After running a few laps around the manor, Huang Xiaolong stopped the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. He patted its head in approval. “Not bad. I’ll call you Blacky from now on.”

Blacky?!

Tai Yue and the others felt an explosion going off in their head.

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin felt exceptionally aggrieved. “Master... Blacky is too jarring on the ears! Why don’t you use my original name instead?”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled and agreed. “That will do.”

In all honesty, he was messing about with the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin and had no intention of bestowing such an effortless name.

Eventually, he learned about the original name of the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. It was called Hao Ren.

“Master, I received a report from some of my subordinates that Shi Yinyu of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe went to meet with Song Litao in secret.” Asura King Jin Yuan spoke up all of a sudden.

Even though Shi Yinyu had taken all the precautions he could to hide his tracks, he wasn’t able to deceive the Netherworld King’s Organization.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t feel too much of a shock when he heard the news. Instead, he shickered. “Guess I was right. Shi Yinyu is about to form an alliance with Song Litao.” After pausing for a second, he continued, “Shi Yinyu, Song Litao, and that guy called Yi Qing... The more the merrier!”

Desolate Giant Tai Yue seemed to hesitate for a moment before speaking up. “Master, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe will probably send over some super experts. It’s better to be careful.”

Even though they knew that Huang Xiaolong had a hundred Undead Race Netherguard puppets and the Eternal City, they felt that the alliance between three mega superpowers would be a little difficult to handle!

After all, the alliance between the Massacring Gods Gate, Howling Moon Wolf Race, and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe was enough to cause Tai Yue’s scalp to tingle.

“Are you thinking of sending some of our experts over as well?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Yes. That is what we think.” Tai Yue continued, “Since the battle with the Asura Gate, many people have already guessed our identities. There is no longer a need to hide. Since they are already calling for backup, we can similarly summon the experts from the Netherworld King’s Organization on our side. Let’s just carry out a massive battle right here!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Fan Hui, Wan Yuntian, and Jin Yuan.

“That is what we think as well.” The three of them said in unison. No matter what their opinion was, they replied to Huang Xiaolong in a respectful manner.

Huang Xiaolong sank into silence for a second before speaking up. “Alright. You guys can relay your orders. Every single commander, regardless of seniority, is to gather at the Nethersea. You guys can tell the five other Great Commanders, Feng Huang, He Lianfeng, Cang Mingtian, Yi Fei, and Pang De about my identity. Tell them to bring all the Senior and Junior Commanders under them to rush over from whatever world they are in.”

“Yes, master!”

Four booming voices echoed out in the Heaven Dome Manor.

A resplendent light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. The battle he was about to cause would shake the corners of Hell itself.

The Netherworld King’s Organization would finally clash with the Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and the Howling Moon Wolf Race for the first time!

When he thought about the bloodbath that was about to take place, dense killing intent clouded his eyes.

However, Huang Xiaolong still felt a little apprehensive when he thought about the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. A light flashed in his hand and a mirror appeared.

Looking at the mirror in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, all four of them were stunned for a second. However, when they thought about what the item in Huang Xiaolong’s hand could be, their expression changed.

“This... Is this the Nine Yin Magic Mirror?!” Wan Yutian yelled in disbelief.

This was the inheritance treasure of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe! It had already disappeared for hundreds of millions of years, but now, Huang Xiaolong took it out as though it was nothing!

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and chuckled, “This should be the Nine Yin Magic Mirror. However, it’s a little different from the mirror in the past. I have been researching it for the past few years, but I couldn’t learn of its uses.”

“Master, do you mind letting me look at it?” Tai Yue asked all of a sudden.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and passed the mirror over.

After Tai Yue received it, he started to scrutinize every part of it. He muttered to himself in excitement, “This is really the Nine Yin Magic Mirror! However, master is right. There are really some differences with it... In the past, the markings on it were the same on both sides of the mirror. However, the ones on the front are a little green right now...”

Jin Yuan and the others gathered around and they started to observe the mirror together.

“Do you know how to use the Nine Yin Magic Mirror?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

All of them shook their heads at once.

“The Nine Yin Magic Mirror can only be used after learning a secret technique of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. We have no idea how to use it.” Tai Yue sighed. “In fact, even Shi Yinyu might not be able to use it.”

Fan Hui’s eyes shone all of a sudden. “Master, since you have already received old master’s inheritance, why don’t you try to use it?”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second. That’s right... The energy contained in the Heart of Hell is the most primal source of darkness energy. Since the Nine Yin Magic Mirror is an artifact born in hell, the darkness energy from the Heart of Hell should be able to activate it!

As long as he could destroy the restrictions on the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, refining it wouldn’t be a problem.

“That’s right! Master, you should give it a shot.” Four voices sounded out in unison.

“Alright!” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and sent them out to protect him. After sitting down on the ground, he circulated the energy contained in the Heart of Hell.

Along with the activation of the Heart of Hell, a part of the void started to fluctuate.

Traces of primal energy started to descend and it landed on the Nine Yin Magic Mirror. After fully covering it, Huang Xiaolong realized that the mirror emitted resplendent green light. There were flashes of black mixed into it and it seemed to work.

Huang Xiaolong burst into joy when he saw what was happening. He had tried countless ways to refine the mirror, but he had never succeeded.

When the four of them saw what happened, they felt unbridled joy in their heart. The Nine Yin Magic Mirror was the inheritance treasure of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. Its might wasn’t something that could be imagined. Moreover, it was also a Supreme Grandmist Artifact. As long as Huang Xiaolong refined it, he would be in possession of two Supreme Grandmist Artifacts!

The second the Nine Yin Magic Mirror emitted blinding rays of green light, the old ancestor of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Shi Ming, opened his eyes abruptly. There were traces of shock, joy, and disbelief as he stared blankly into space. The dense death qi that was surrounding his body started to swirl around at an alarming pace.

The Nine Yin Magic Mirror had some sort of mysterious connection to his bloodline, and the moment it was activated, Shi Ming was able to feel that someone had managed to break the restrictions on it!
