Chapter 2634: Evolved Saint Godheads!

Feitian Longpeng and the others responded hastily when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said, “Your Highness, how can we help you? We are willing to do anything for Your Highness!”

The Flying Heaven Race felt that it would be their honor to be of use to Huang Xiaolong.

Even though they didn’t know why the members of the Golden Buddha Race had let them off, they could make several guesses in their minds. They knew that it had to do with Huang Xiaolong’s final attack.

No matter what, Huang Xiaolong’s display of strength had shocked Chan Yuli into backing off. When anyone thought up to that point, no one dared to continue thinking about it.

Huang Xiaolong’s image in their hearts was comparable to a Primal Ancestor. No, it had long since transcended the Primal Ancestor Realm. He was like a god to them! If anyone were to ask them to evaluate Huang Xiaolong’s future accomplishments, the members of the Flying Heaven Race would say that he would be the next Mansion Master!

No, it would be more appropriate to say that Huang Xiaolong’s image in their hearts had already eclipsed the current Mansion Master. To them, Huang Xiaolong was the son of the Almighty Creator!

As such, they were extremely willing to be of help to him.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly when he noticed the look in their eyes. His initial plan was to head over to the Flying Heaven Race, but he hadn’t thought that he would be saving Feitian Longpeng and the rest when crossing the Golden Buddha Region. With their assistance, the pressure he would face when trying to obtain their hidden treasury would decrease by a whole bunch.

After all, Feitian Longpeng was the young patriarch of the Flying Heaven Race. After saving him and several doyens in their party, Huang Xiaolong’s words in the Flying Heaven Race would hold some weight.

Without hesitation, he retrieved the Flying Heaven Blood Stele.

“This… This… Flying Heaven Blood Stele!” The experts of the Flying Heaven Race widened their eyes in shock when they noticed the artifact in Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

The Flying Heaven Blood Stele is back!

After several hundreds of millions of years, the Flying Heaven Blood Stele had appeared in the hands of a human!

“This…” Even someone like Feitian Longpeng didn’t know what to say. Even though Huang Xiaolong hadn’t said anything, he had a slight guess as to the favor he wanted.

However, it was something he couldn’t agree to easily!

The Flying Heaven Blood Stele belonged to the first generation’s patriarch of the race, and it was the inheritance treasure meant to be passed down through the ages. It was also the reason the members of the Flying Heaven Race had expended ample resources in order to locate it!

The experts of the Flying Heaven Race stared at each other in silence.

Keeping silent, Huang Xiaolong waited for them to come to a decision.

If Feitian Longpeng could agree to help him, everything would be great. If they refused, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t mind it either. After all, his Saint godheads had already advanced into the top ten ranks. He wouldn’t be worried if Chan Yuli showed up personally, and a mere Flying Heaven Race wouldn’t be able to stop him!

Feitian Longpeng’s expression started to flicker, and he didn’t know what to do. The gazes of everyone from the race gathered onto him, and his next words would determine their actions. After all, he was the young patriarch of the race. His words carried the most weight out of everyone present.

“Alright.” After a long while, Feitian Longpeng gritted his teeth, and he nodded in acknowledgment. “We said it before. We will agree to anything Your Highness requests.”

Even though the hidden treasury of the race was extremely important to them, Feitian Longpeng decided to bet on Huang Xiaolong’s future.

Also, he knew that it didn’t matter if he refused. With Huang Xiaolong’s strength, they wouldn’t be able to force him to return the blood stele. Since they couldn’t beat him, they might as well join him.

Whatever the case, they were not able to locate the hidden treasury of their race without the stele. Therefore, helping him could do them no harm.

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he saw their reactions. A look of appreciation appeared in his eyes, and he reassured Feitian Longpeng, “Relax. I only wish to obtain the grand dao treasures within. I’ll leave everything else to you guys.”

The reason Huang Xiaolong had wanted to locate the hidden treasury was for him to increase his strength as best he could. Breaking through to the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm was the most important matter right now, and everything else could wait.

Looks of excitement formed on the faces of everyone present when they heard that Huang Xiaolong was willing to return everything else to them.

“This… Many thanks to Your Highness!” Feitian Longpeng took the lead and kneeled down to thank Huang Xiaolong.

The members of the Flying Heaven Race followed suit.

“Let’s go. Shall we head over to the Flying Heaven Region now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Feitian Longpeng and the others didn’t hesitate to lead the way.

As such, the group continued on their way.

Along the journey, Huang Xiaolong didn’t reveal the existence of the Cangqiong Dao Palace. He boarded the Flying Heaven Race’s flying ship and allowed the members of the Flying Heaven Race to do their thing. Of course, the flying ship was a high-grade holy artifact. Despite its grade, its speed was incomparable to the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

Right now, Huang Xiaolong’s goal was to hide the fact that he was the disciple of the Cangqiong Old Man. If his identity was exposed, it would be nearly impossible to retain his position in the Otherworldly Mansion. It was likely that Long Shengtian would immediately retract his support.

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong was assigned the best cultivation room on the ship.

The decorations and facilities of the best room could be said to rival most of the luxurious cultivation palaces out there. The holy spiritual qi in the air was shocking.

It was even better than the Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave in the Otherworldly Mansion!

Of course, none of it mattered to Huang Xiaolong.

Sitting in the middle of the room, Huang Xiaolong’s godheads appeared in the space above him as all twelve Saint Fates surrounded them.

Since the last time they had evolved, the three Saint godheads were no longer the same as before. Their appearances were completely different, and the light they emitted was something that even the most precious of treasures would lack.

A giant dragon beast formed one of the godheads, and it had the body of a dragon and the face of a man. It emitted a terrifying amount of dragon’s might that no other creature possessed.

Looking at the other godhead, one of them emitted boundless devilish light that contained both darkness and frost attributes.

As for the final Saint godhead, it seemed to contain the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The creations of the heavens were captured perfectly by Huang Xiaolong’s final godhead.

After the evolution, Huang Xiaolong possessed the second, third and fourth-ranked godheads! They were the Xuanhuang Supreme Dragon Saint Godhead, Nefarious Origin Saint Godhead, and the Great Immemorial Saint Godhead, respectively!

The aura they emitted after appearing together was terrifying! It was enough to shake the heavens, and it was a might no individual should possess!

As a horrifying amount of holy spiritual qi descended from the void, all of it poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body. The grand dao didn’t remain idle either as it nourished his Inextinguishable Dao Heart. His Saint Fate Memory Imprint flashed steadily in the middle of his eyebrows.

His Saint godheads weren’t the only thing that had evolved. One had to know that his Saint bloodlines and physiques had entered the top ten ranks during the evolution.

Despite the repeated breakthroughs, Huang Xiaolong knew that his Saint godheads were no longer as stable as they once were. He had to solidify his foundations through focused cultivation. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As Huang Xiaolong made his way over to the Flying Heaven Race with Feitian Longpeng and the others, the Alien Lands trembled.

“What?! Huang Xiaolong has returned?! How can he be in the Golden Buddha Region? He killed hundreds of experts before leaving?!”

“I heard that Huang Xiaolong has a Primal Ancestor as his bodyguard… He even managed to stop Ancestor Chan Yuli of the Golden Buddha Race from chasing him down!”

As the news started to spread around the Alien Lands, Yuan Qianxing soon caught wind of it.
