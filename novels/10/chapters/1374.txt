“You, you, you—!” Black Ice Ancestor’s voice was quivering, and her face was as pale as someone who might have soaked in water for a few years.

She had assumed that void devil beast Xu Baisheng was a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm like Gui Yi. But now, it dawned on her how wrong she was!

Zhu Yi too had an ugly expression on his face, and there a flutter of panic in his heart.

Feng Yingying was shocked as she looked at the void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and she was inwardly trying to guess his strength... Second Order God King Realm? Or mid-Second Order God King Realm, perhaps late-Second Order God King Realm?!

This, this adorable looking charcoal-colored beast is actually a Second Order God King Realm master!

There’s actually a Second Order God King Realm beast by Huang Xiaolong’s side?!

How?!

Feng Yingying shook her head, unable to accept this truth.

At this moment, Feng Yingying realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t relying on Golden Brow, Blood Knife, or on the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate, but on a Second Order God King Realm beast!

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng felt a little shy being at the center of everyone’s attention, and scratched his head while saying, “Don’t look at me like this, my face is going to turn red.”

Everyone nearly plummeted to the ground at his words.

Huang Xiaolong’s frosty eyes were fixed on Feng Yingying and the rest of the sea tribe’s group.

Divine elephant Xiang Xun was still inside the Brimming Snow Palace, as he was assisting the little cow to suppress the evil spirit inside Li Lu’s body. However, with the late-Third Order God King Realm Xu Baisheng around, it was enough to kill the whole sea tribe’s group.

Huang Xiaolong sneered when he detected the fleeting panic and fear over the Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da’s face. ‘Seven great God King Realm masters? Merely seven people who had just broken through to the early First Order God King Realm were threatening him and the Fortune Gate. Even if the seven of them were to combine their strength, they still weren’t enough to fight against the void devil beast Xu Baisheng.’

It would have been a different scenario if Feng Jingxi, Guo Da, and the other five Ancestors would have been late-Second Order God King Realm masters. In that situation, they could have fought Xu Baisheng by combining their powers.

“Kill them!” Huang Xiaolong ordered Xu Baisheng as he pointed at Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi.

Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi’s pupils dilated in fear when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s order.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng respectfully complied and leaped straight at Guo Da and Guo Shi.

“Ancestors and Patriarchs, join hands to form the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation!” Feng Yingying cried out urgently.

The Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation was one of the sea tribe’s heritage from ancient times. The stronger the people forming the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation, the synergy of their strengths greatly raised the formation’s power.

Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da immediately stood at the center, while the rest of the sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs erected several layers of circles around Guo Da to form the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation.

Waves of godforce rushed into the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation from these sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs, casting a shadow over the sky.

Surreal images of various divine beasts appeared into the high sky.

The formation pulsated with heart-palpitating ripples of energy.

Feng Yingying’s heart eased seeing this. She looked at Huang Xiaolong with a faint mocking smile. “Huang Xiaolong, even if your beast is a Second Order God King Realm, our Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation will easily suppress him!”

She then turned to Guo Da and shouted, “Kill this beast for me, kill that slut—!”

Her slender finger trembled in anger as pointed at void devil beast Xu Baisheng and Feng Er.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng snickered coldly; he stepped forth and slapped onto the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation with his claws.

Corrosive devil qi surged like a ferocious beast, banging onto the sea tribe’s formation.

Rumble—!

In the split second of collision the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation was shattered into nothing.

Guo Da’s face turned several shades whiter, and the other Ancestors and Patriarchs were thrown out in various directions. A few of the weaker sea tribe’s Patriarchs were bleeding all over, even Guo Da who had broken through to God King Realm was vomiting blood!

Guo Da and the others crashed heavily to the ground in different locations of the Fortune City.

Zhu Yi, Black Ice Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, as well as Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor gasped at this sight.

Especially Black Ice Ancestor’s lips were quivering with fear and shock.

Feng Yingying’s face was already deathly pale, even so, she refused to believe what she was witnessing. She shook her head, as if she had lost her mind, “Im-possible...?!”

“Why? Why is it like this?!”

“Impossible, I don’t believe this! Even if he’s a mid-Second Order God King Realm, it’s impossible to break the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation!”

Feng Yingying shrieked repeatedly, as she was extremely agitated.

Zhu Yi, Black Ice Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and the others were staring wide-eyed at void devil beast Xu Baisheng.

The Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation was easily broken by this mid-Second Order God King Realm master... How was it possible?!

Late-Second Order God King Realm?!

No! Even a late-Second Order God King Realm won’t be able to break the sea tribe’s Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation with just one move!

In other words, was this adorable looking beast by Huang Xiaolong’s side a peak late-Second Order God King Realm master? He might even be an early Third Order God King Realm master!

Early Third Order God King Realm! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The more Zhu Yi, Black Ice Ancestor, and others thought about it, the more sense it made. This could very well explain why this beast was able to break the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation, which was otherwise unbreakable by even the Second Order God King Realm Master!

This beast is not a mid-Second Order God King Realm but an early Third Order God King Realm!

After clearing the doubt in their minds, Zhu Yi, Black Ice Ancestor, and others looked as if they were having a stroke. Black Ice Ancestor was shaking badly.

Meanwhile, void devil beast Xu Baisheng reached out and grabbed the Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi with his claw, and flung them across the air. As Xu Baisheng gripped them tightly, Guo Da and Guo Shi felt like they would explode to their deaths.

Corrosive devil flames snaked out from Xu Baisheng’s claws and wound around Guo Da and Guo Shi; screams and grunts reverberated in the air. Right before Feng Yingying, Black Ice Ancestor, and the others, Guo Da and Guo Shi were getting completely corroded, and soon only their godheads would be left behind. It was no secret amongst Huang Xiaolong’s group that Senior Xiaoniu loved munching on the godheads. Hence, Xu Baisheng was planning to destroy only their souls, while keeping the godheads intact.

Just like that, the Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi were getting killed in front of everyone.

Black Ice Ancestor almost stumbled from high up in the air, as she witnessed Xu Baisheng killing Guo Family’s Ancestor and Patriarch, who belonged to one of the twelve sea tribe’s prominent families.

Guo Family’s Guo Da shouted madly, “I’m a God King, the king of gods. My body is immortal, my godhead is immortal, you can’t kill me. Huang Xiaolong, there’ll be a day when I will annihilate you, you little pup!”

Upon breaking through to God King Realm, they had comprehended the esoteric of life, turning their bodies and godheads immortal. For example; even if their arms, hands, internal organs were cut off or shattered, they could grow them back. Even if their godhead was broken, it could still be repaired.

This was the frightening vitality of a God King Realm master.

“Can’t kill you?” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng snorted with disdain and mocked, “Although a God King Realm cultivation is said to be immortal, how can it be truly undying? If that was the case, then during the Divine World’s calamity in the past, there wouldn’t have been a sea of God King Realm masters’ corpses!” With that said, corrosive devil flames danced vigorously from his claws.

Guo Da’s body was slowly eaten away by the black flames. As he was getting incinerated, his body started expanding at a rapid pace. Seeing this, void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s corrosive devil flames also grew bigger. Instantly, the burning speed became faster than the speed of Guo Da’s expanding body.

In the end, Guo Family’s Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi were killed just the same! Leaving only their godheads.

Huang Xiaolong was not idle on the side as he swiftly collected Guo Da and Guo Shi’s spatial rings.
