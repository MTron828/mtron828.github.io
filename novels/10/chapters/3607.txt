Chapter 3608 – Stolen!

Huang Xiaolong had no idea what happened in the Limitless Celestial Empire.

As he continued to refine the universe source qi, his understanding of the mysteries of the universe started to deepen. The impurities in his bloodline were slowly purified.

A hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.

On the day when the final strand of universe source qi was refined, Huang Xiaolong slowly opened his eyes.

After the years that passed, Huang Xiaolong improved quite a lot. He felt much lighter when he got to his feet and he discovered that the impurities in his body were one tenth of what it was!

He also discovered that he managed to reach the 18.4 billion mark now that he completed his cultivation session. The golden grand cosmos energy that populated the three great worlds were much more powerful than before.

Huang Xiaolong rejoiced inwardly.

Moreover, he could tell that his connection with the Universe Boat had deepened significantly after so many years of cultivation. According to his estimations, he would be able to enter the second layer of restrictions after throwing in a hundred more high-grade universe-level spiritual veins.

After opening the second layer, he was sure that he could rid his body of all impurities.

Huang Xiaolong noticed that he was far too weak. Even though he managed to increase his strength in the past by devouring other people’s bloodlines, it was an elementary level way of improving his strength. Even with the help of the Universe Boat to purify the hidden threats in his body left behind, he would never be able to break through to the grand completion stage if that kept up.

He would forever be stuck at the large completion stage, never to enter the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm if nothing changed!

Whatever the case, entering the second layer of restrictions was sure to show better effects. He might be able to enter the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm when that happens.

A moment later, he left the grand formation of the Universe Boat.

After a hundred thousand years, Tao Hang and Tao Han’er experienced a significant increase in strength. After all, they had the assistance of the five beast kings.

Tao Hang ran over in a fluster the moment Huang Xiaolong appeared. “Lord, Lin Xian wishes to meet you the moment you leave seclusion! He has something to report!”

“Alright, send him over.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Bowing, Tao Hang ran out of the manor.

Huang Xiaolong sank deep into thought. Could they have deciphered the location on the YIn Yang Treasure Map?

“Lord, I…” Tao Han’er whispered from the side.

“Han’er, what’s wrong?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“I… I wish to travel to the Hengshan Mountain Range to train myself.”

She had been following Huang Xiaolong all these years and she hadn’t left the manor in a long time. Even if she did, she would only travel around the city. She wanted to travel the world for a long time.

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly when he heard her request, “You should travel around to gain some experience.”

Even though Tao Hang and Tao Han’er followed him to the Yin Yang City, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t been able to take care of them throughout the way. All of them were cooped up in the manor and there weren’t many chances for them to experience the world.

Tao Han’er’s face lit up when she heard Huang Xiaolong’s instructions. “Many thanks to the lord!”

“Alright, I’ll get the Azure Eagle King to follow you around.” Huang Xiaolong continued.

A sweet smile formed on Tao Han’er’s lips as she giggled slightly, “I knew that you’ll say that! Hehehe, you really do like me!”

A trace of mischief flashed through her eyes.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t want her to travel into the depths of the mountain range. The Hengshan Mountain Range was the largest mountain range in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire, and it was much more dangerous compared to the Sentient Mountain Range back in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire.

Tao Han’er nodded obediently when Huang Xiaolong explained what she could do.

A moment later, Celestial Emperor Lin Xian appeared and greeted Huang Xiaolong respectfully.

“I heard from Tao Hang that you’re looking for me…” Huang Xiaolong said.

Lin Xian glanced at Tao Han’er, but Huang Xiaolong interrupted him before he could say anything. “It’s alright, you can speak your mind.”

“My report has something to do with the Yin Yang Treasure Map. The treasure map was stolen by the Dragon Overlord!”

“The chicken man stole it?!” Huang Xiaolong blurted out before he could stop himself. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Even though he had long since estimated that the Limitless Master would never be able to keep the treasure map with his strength, he didn’t expect that the Dragon Overlord would be the one to snatch it away. Huang Xiaolong frowned. If that chicken b*star went over to grab the Yin Yang Flame Wheel, his strength would increase by a whole level! That wasn’t good news for Huang Xiaolong.

Lin Xian couldn’t be bothered with what Huang Xiaolong was thinking. He felt the world collapsing around him when he heard how Huang Xiaolong addressed the Dragon Overlord.

That was one of the five strongest experts in the Unknown Space they were talking about! Huang Xiaolong called him a chicken man!

Tao Han’er’s lips curled upwards as she burst out laughing.

A bitter smile slowly formed on Lin Xian’s lips. If the Dragon Overlord heard what Huang Xiaolong called him, he would probably fly into a rage… No. He would probably fly into a rage even without Huang Xiaolong’s provocation.

“When did the chicken freak snatch the map?” Huang Xiaolong asked. Since his mouth slipped, there was no point in upholding formalities.

“Not too long after you entered seclusion, Lord Dragon Overlord personally arrived. Even with the grand formation around the empire, the Limitless Master couldn’t hold him back! During the battle, the Limitless Master was seriously injured. It’s said that he’s still recovering from the battle back then.” Lin Xian explained.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all. As one of the five strongest experts in the Unknown Space, the Dragon Overlord definitely crossed the 20 billion mark. The Limitless Master only had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy, and there was no way he could win.

That was also the reason Huang Xiaolong chose to lie low. He was still lacking when compared to the five experts. If he caught their attention, he would have to fight with everything on the line! When that happened, the existence of the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and four Universe Origin Fires would be revealed. He might be able to fight off a single one of them, but things would definitely go south the moment they ganged up on him.

The only way he would be able to hold them all off would be to enter the grand completion stage. If he managed to accumulate 21 billion units of grand cosmos energy, he would be able to fight one on five with his treasures.

“Also, Ying Ze and Ying Wan’s disappearance has already attracted the attention of the Limitless Celestial Empire.” Lin Xian continued, “They are currently investigating their disappearance.”

If the Limitless Celestial Empire continued their investigations, they would eventually reach Huang Xiaolong.

That was what Lin Xian was afraid of.

“THey can check all they want. There’s no need to obstruct them.” Huang Xiaolong wasn’t affected at all.

Bowing respectfully, Lin Xian continued to make his other reports. He spoke about the matter where the Ocean Race called their forces back, but they didn’t concern Huang Xiaolong in the slightest.

“Check if Zhou Chi is currently residing in the Ice Mountain.” Huang Xiaolong said all of a sudden.

Since everything was over, he wanted to take a trip down to the Ice Mountain.
