Huang Xiaolong shook his head hearing this, “Thank you Third Senior-Apprentice Sister, it is not necessary for now. When the time comes, I will annihilate the Ying Family myself.”

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had decided, Qi Wen merely nodded and did not insist.

Later that day, Huang Xiaolong ordered for all the Martial Spirit World’s Saint realm experts to gather in the Huang Clan Manor.

Moving to the Cloudsea Mainland this time, he was uncertain how many years later he would return once again to the Martial Spirit World, hence Huang Xiaolong decided on a large scale migration.

From the beginning, Huang Xiaolong did not intend to force anyone, bringing only those who were willing to follow him over to the Cloudsea Mainland. As for those preferring to stay, that was fine as well.

However, it would take some time for each and every Martial Spirit World’s Saint realm experts to gather in the Huang Clan Manor. The farthest away would require no less than one month, which meant that Huang Xiaolong needed to stay in the Martial Spirit World for at least that long to settle things.

Going with the flow, Liu Yun and Qi Wen also stayed back, planning to return together with Huang Xiaolong a month later. After all, they had already missed this year’s Black Warrior City annual auction, so they would have to wait for the next auction to get the items they wanted.

In this one month’s time, Huang Xiaolong spent the day with his family, chatting or guiding their cultivation, whereas, at night, he would summon the Gates of Hell and cultivate in Hell’s higher realm environment.

When free, Huang Xiaolong accompanied his Eldest Senior-Apprentice brother and Third Senior-Apprentice Sister sightseeing.

A month later.

Huang Xiaolong, who was a peak early-Second Order God Realm finally advanced to mid-Second Order God Realm. By this time, all Saint realm experts in the Martial Spirit World had assembled in the Huang Clan Manor after receiving Huang Xiaolong’s summon.

Huang Xiaolong then told everyone about migrating to the Cloudsea Mainland.

In the end, around two hundred people were willing to follow Huang Xiaolong to the Cloudsea Mainland. As for the others, Huang Xiaolong did not force them, allowing them to stay behind in the Martial Spirit World.

When the preparations for the big migration were done, Huang Xiaolong brought the Huang Family, Shi Xiaofei, and her father, Blessed Buddha Emperor, the Duanren Emperor, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, the Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Chen, his good friend Xie Puti, and the others, and departed for the Cloudsea Mainland.

When he once again stood in space, Huang Xiaolong turned back to take a glance at the Martial Spirit World behind him before flying off to the Iron Radix World with the rest. Although only God Realm masters and above were capable of traveling by flight in the vast galaxy, this problem was easily resolved with Huang Xiaolong’s Godly Mt Xumi.

It didn’t take Huang Xiaolong’s group long to reach the Iron Radix World. Spending a night to rest in the Iron Radix World, they departed from the transmission array the next morning, and were back in the Cloudsea Mainland some time later.

When the Huang Family members stepped out from the transmission array, their expressions were just like the time when Huang Xiaolong first arrived, absolutely stunned.

Looking at the endless expanse of giant cities on the Cloudsea Mainland, the stone pebbles that were like low-grade spirit pellets strewn on the ground, the neverending streams of extravagant carriages entering and leaving the mainland, everyone was dumbstruck.

Even Shi Xiaofei couldn’t hide her shock from showing on her face, but even so, her shocked expression was still charming.

The Blessed Buddha Emperor, Duanren Emperor, and the others watched as countless numbers of half-step God Realm and peak half-step God Realm were flying past them and humility rose in their hearts.

In the Martial Spirit World, they were one of the few pinnacle existences, but here, they were the same as any other country bumpkins.

Vividly aware of the contemptuous and ridiculing gazes directed their way, the Blessed Buddha Emperor, Duanren Emperor, and the others dared not raise their heads.

This did not escape Huang Xiaolong’s notice, however, he did not say anything. This was a normal reaction, arriving in a new unfamiliar place. Once everyone got used to the environment, things would gradually improve.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong was confident that with his help, everyone would have successive breakthroughs. Although he dared not guarantee that everyone would step into the God Realm, reaching peak half-step God Realm within two to three hundred years was not an issue.

As for his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, and the others limited by their innate talent, unable to advance to the Xiantian realm, it was no longer a cause for worry because he had inquired the matter from his Master Feng Yang. His Master could resolve this issue.

At that time, his parents and siblings would be able to have a breakthrough to the Xiantian realm, adding years to their lifespan. At least they would live beyond three hundred years. As for the years after that, Huang Xiaolong would think of another method to help his parents and the others break through to the Saint realm.

Upon arrival, Huang Xiaolong led the group toward Changzhi City. Now, the first thing he needed to do was buy a property so his family could settle down.

He took into consideration the fact that Changzhi City was closest to the Black Warrior City, thus made it convenient for Huang Xiaolong to visit them at any time. He had decided early on to purchase a property in Changzhi City.

Back when they arrived in the Cloudsea Mainland, Liu Yun and Qi Wen had matters to attend to, so the two bade farewell to Huang Xiaolong and headed to Black Warrior City, separating from Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Reaching Changzhi City, Huang Xiaolong went straight to the Azure Sea Firm with the Huang Family. However, when Huang Xiaolong’s group stepped into the building’s main hall, the other customers around that were at the firm to purchase things immediately noticed them.

“Houtian? Xiantian?!”

“Are my eyes seeing this right? There are actually Houtian and Xiantian ants appearing in Changzhi City!”

Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohai, and the others’ appearance raised a fuss in the hall.

“This Brother, my apologies, our Azure Sea Firm does not permit customers to bring their Houtian and Xiantian realm servants inside.” At one point, an Azure Sea Firm disciple in charge of greeting guests approached Huang Xiaolong, explaining in a polite manner.

If it weren’t for the Black Warrior Institute inner disciple robe on Huang Xiaolong’s body, the disciple would have shooed them away without saying a word, would he have reminded Huang Xiaolong with such courtesy?

The Azure Sea Firm was one of Black Tortoise Galaxy’s largest firms, how could they allow flies like Houtian and Xiantian realms hanging around, lowering the status of their firm?

Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the rest were enraged hearing the disciple’s words; this Azure Sea Firm’s disciple was clearly looking down on them. The servants he talked about were obviously Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohai, Guo Xiaofan, and the others.

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand, stopping Zhao Shu and the rest from taking any further action. The Cloudsea Mainland was not Martial Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong was worried they would attack due to impulse, not knowing the rules of the Cloudsea Mainland.

“Are you sure?” Huang Xiaolong’s icy stare was fixed on the Azure Sea Firm disciple.

The Azure Sea Firm disciple was greatly dissatisfied with the nonchalant look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Wasn’t he just a Black Warrior Institute inner disciple? He actually had the guts to behave so arrogantly in front of their Azure Sea Firm!

Not to mention a mere Black Warrior Institute inner disciple, even an elite disciple wouldn’t dare to behave insolently in their Azure Sea Firm.

The disciple in charge of greeting pulled his face, “I’m very sure, if you refuse to tell these servants to go out, I will make sure they roll out of here!”

A mocking cold sneer emerged on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he took out a purplish gold token, flinging it into the disciple’s hand.

“Su-supreme guest card!” The disciple’s voice trembled, and his face became ashen. His throat felt dry.

This Black Warrior Institute inner disciple actually had their Azure Sea Firm’s highest supreme guest card, representing their firm’s most honored guests! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Call your supervisor out here!” Huang Xiaolong snapped.
