Chapter 507: Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi

Huang Xiaolong’s body shook, immediately noticing that something was not right.

‘This is....?!’ His spiritual sense observed the Dragon Pearl, watching as the shadow of a dragon inside the pearl was growing corporeal! Resurrected!

A thousand zhang long five-clawed golden dragon, hovering inside the Dragon Pearl space resembling an imposing ancient mountain. The bone dragon’s blood essence was like a flood of rapid currents that found an opening as it whirled out of control to the five-clawed golden dragon’s mouth.

Huang Xiaolong was feeling extremely antsy as he tried to manipulate the Dragon Pearl to reduce the speed of the bone dragon’s blood essence flowing into it, but to his dismay, it was futile. The Dragon Pearl was out of his control.

The Dragon Pearl seemed to have merged into one entity with the five-clawed golden dragon, and would only act according to the five-clawed golden dragon’s will.

Very soon, Huang Xiaolong noticed something else. The bone dragon’s blood essence absorbed by the five-clawed golden dragon through its mouth then diffused out through its pores, permeating every corner of Huang Xiaolong’s body.

It seemed like the five-clawed golden dragon was refining the true dragon blood essence before being absorbed by Huang Xiaolong, in exchange for a purer and more potent energy.

Huang Xiaolong stopped resisting and began to absorb the refined true dragon blood essence as fast as he could. A comfortable and pleasant feeling spread through Huang Xiaolong, from his body deep into his soul. A brief moment later, loud crackling noises sounded inside his body.

To his delight and surprise, the barrier to Tenth Order Saint realm finally shattered! The Saint realm power roared in his meridians and veins, moving vibrantly as his Qi Sea continued to spew out abundant vigorous battle qi like an eternal spring that would never dry.

One hour passed by the time the bone dragon’s true dragon blood essence abruptly stopped flowing into the Dragon Pearl. Huang Xiaolong was stunned, especially when he saw that it was because all the true dragon blood essence was already absorbed by the five-clawed golden dragon!

In merely one hour!

At Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, refining the bone dragon at his normal speed would need half a year’s time, but in just one hour, the five-clawed golden dragon inside the Dragon Pearl had absorbed all the bone dragon’s true dragon blood essences!

Another thing that Huang Xiaolong noticed was the fact that the benefits he received this time were much more compared to refining the true dragon blood essence by himself, despite the majority of it going to the five-clawed golden dragon.

What made Huang Xiaolong speechless was that the five-clawed golden dragon’s open mouth actually shifted toward the primordial divine nether dragon beside the bone dragon and started inhaling its true dragon blood essence.

True dragon blood essence from the primordial divine nether dragon was outpouring frantically, straight toward the five-clawed golden dragon.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyeballs almost fell out of their sockets. ‘This is true, right? What the...!’

The Dragon God Grass that he had taken was only enough for him to refine two primordial divine dragons. If he continued to refine another one, would he suffer a backlash from this?

But Huang Xiaolong was not given any option or time, for the upgraded true dragon blood essence was already diffusing from the five-clawed golden dragon’s body, entering his, and it contained a more potent energy than the bone dragon’s true dragon blood essence.

Quickly running the Asura Tactics, Huang Xiaolong began refining the true dragon blood essence diffused from the five-clawed golden dragon. In just a few breaths’ time, he immediately discovered that it did not pose any problem at all despite having no Dragon God Grass. Refining the improved true dragon blood essence brought him no adverse effects, and had even better results.

Next was the devil dragon, followed by the true dragon, sky dragon, and ice dragon.

All the remaining primordial divine dragons were refined by the five-clawed golden dragon and Huang Xiaolong, one after another.

Huang Xiaolong’s strength soared with rapid speed; early Tenth Order Saint realm, the peak of early Tenth Order, mid, peak mid-Tenth Order, and gradually slowed as he broke through peak mid-Tenth Order Saint realm.

Huang Xiaolong continued to run the Asura Tactics until he completed more than a dozen cycles before stopping, then he opened his eyes. Lightly breathing out, space jittered as if a strong squall blew past it.

Before Huang Xiaolong could react, a coruscating light flashed in front of him, revealing a vapory giant dragon. This giant dragon was the very same five-clawed golden dragon within the Dragon Pearl.

Neither of them made a sound. Huang Xiaolong carefully observed the huge dragon scales on its body, the horns that looked like they could tear a hole in the firmament, its bright crimson dragon eyes that were shining like blood. Huang Xiaolong reacted a moment later, jumping to his feet.

“Little guy, fret not, I bear no ill-will.” The giant five-clawed golden dragon enjoyed Huang Xiaolong’s reaction with mirth in its eyes, speaking in the human tongue to reassure Huang Xiaolong. “I am Ao Taiyi, the Martial Spirit World’s first generation Dragon Emperor. My body was destroyed by an enemy, and my soul was heavily injured. Under those circumstances, I ordered the Dragon Elders to seal my soul inside the Dragon Pearl with supreme power, borrowing the dragon qi inside the Dragon Pearl to nourish my soul. More than sixty thousand years have passed, and my soul has finally recovered.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded.

‘Ao Taiyi? Martial Spirit World’s first generation Dragon Emperor?’

Disregarding Huang Xiaolong’s reaction, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi continued, “Fortunately, you have been refining these primordial divine dragons’ true dragon blood essence that helped me rebuild my physical body.”

Huang Xiaolong was dazed by what the first generation Dragon Emperor was saying. The true dragon blood essences he had been refining?

“Although I was sealed inside the Dragon Pearl, I’m also the Dragon Pearl’s second form. I’m the Dragon Pearl, and the Dragon Pearl is me. However, you already refined the Dragon Pearl, therefore, putting it in another way, the current me is considered as an avatar of you.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said.

“You’re my avatar?!” Huang Xiaolong was again, dumbfounded. But he did not sense any blood connection with this Dragon Emperor Taiyi.

Dragon Emperor Taiyi nodded, “That’s right, I know the doubt in your heart, but the truth is, you have yet to truly refine the Dragon Pearl.”

“Have yet truly refined it?” Huang Xiaolong took a small blow.

“Yes. This Dragon Pearl is a heritage treasure of our Dragon Clan, if you want to truly refine it, you must first possess Godforce.”

Godforce!

Wouldn’t that mean that he must first reach the Highgod Realm?! Huang Xiaolong inhaled sharply at the enormity of the matter. At present, Huang Xiaolong felt that the Highgod Realm was too remote a goal, he hadn’t even touched the edge of the God Realm. Highgod Realm, the level above God Realm.

Subsequently, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi imparted information related to the Dragon Clan and about himself to Huang Xiaolong.

From Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, Huang Xiaolong came to know that the Dragon Pearl had already merged with him despite not having truly been refined. It could no longer be separated from Huang Xiaolong. If he was killed or died, then the Dragon Pearl would no longer exist. Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi sealed inside the Dragon Pearl would also die.

Although Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi had rebuilt a new body, which enabled him to move outside of the Dragon Pearl within a thousand zhang radius, the other side of the coin also meant that he couldn’t be separated from Huang Xiaolong more than a thousand zhang.

Unless Huang Xiaolong could undo the seal on the Dragon Pearl, granting true freedom to Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi.

However, the seal was placed by the combined efforts of a group of Dragon Clan Elders, thus undoing the seal was easier said than done. At the very least, Huang Xiaolong would need to reach the Highgod Realm to have any hope.

In between, Huang Xiaolong took the chance to ask Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi some questions, resolving the doubts he had; such as why was Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was able to refine one primordial divine dragon in approximately one hour’s time, about the true dragon blood essence inside the Dragon Pearl, and why did he not suffer a backlash despite the absence of Dragon God Grass.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi chuckled, “My new body is like a vast sea, whereas one primordial divine dragon is a little brook, that’s why it doesn’t affect me regardless of how fast I refine them. Moreover, the Dragon Pearl is capable of purifying all energy.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up hearing that. He understood what Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was telling him, a being’s body was like a container. The stronger one’s body is, the bigger the container; then their refinement speed could also be faster.

And, the Dragon Pearl could actually purify all and any kind of energy?!

Note:

Many times ’Taiyi’ is used in names/titles of cultivation techniques, origins, etc. denotes supremity, greatness, highest existence, and such; mostly an abstract concept.
