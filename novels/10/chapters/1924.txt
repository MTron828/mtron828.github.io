Colorful Balloons Take Flight

A silly smile appeared on Xie Puti’s face as he started giggling non-stop.

The gloomy feeling in the hall dispersed in an instant, and everyone started joking around. The oppressive feeling that everyone had felt in their hearts just a moment ago vanished.

Huang Xiaohai finally released Huang Xiaolong as a trace of embarrassment appeared on his face.

Huang Xiaolong walked towards the members of the Asura Gate as he personally helped them up. When he was done, he made his way towards Xie Puti and punched him lightly on the arm. “Brat, you’re finally at the mid-Tenth Order Highgod Realm after so many years...”

Xie Puti couldn’t help but laugh. “Do you think that everyone is a freak like you?”

The two of them burst out laughing instantly.

Everything felt so familiar, and nothing in the world seemed to matter.

When Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze around everyone in the hall, a frown slowly formed on his face. “Xiaohai, where is everyone else?”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but realize that a few people were missing.

“Big brother, you better take a seat first.” Huang Xiaohai hastily moved aside as Huang Xiaolong took the main seat in the hall.

Nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong made his way towards the main seat.

“A hundred years ago, all of them flew towards the Divine World to look for you.” Huang Xiaohai explained.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank the moment he heard the news. They didn’t wait for the thirty thousand year time limit before ascending.

A hundred years ago?!

If they left the lower world a hundred years ago, it would have been ten years ago in the Divine World.

Ten years ago, he had been looking for the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and the Glaze Devil Stele in the Devil World.

Huang Xiaolong sighed.

He couldn’t help but feel that it was too risky.

The Divine World wasn’t as simple as they thought.

“Big brother...” Huang Xiaohai stared at the complicated look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. He couldn’t help but feel that something was wrong. “Will they run into any trouble?”

A smile broke out on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he saw the worried expression on Huang Xiaohai’s face. “Don’t worry about it. When I return to the Divine World, I’ll look for them immediately.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Divine World might be boundless, but with Huang Xiaolong’s ability, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to look for a few people.

The only thing he was worried about was Xiaofei.

Since she had an innate Buddhist Physique, things could get troublesome if she ascended for the Buddhist World.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but rub his temples.

This is really nerve-wracking.

“What about my master?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The Ascending Moon Old Man wasn’t present as well.

Everyone glanced at each other when they heard his question. Huang Xiaohai finally explained the situation. “The Ascending Moon Old Man is one of the elders of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. However, Wangu Wudi suddenly decided to summon him to the headquarters. According to our sources, Wangu Wudi and several other elders are planning to relieve him of his position.”

A chilly light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Wangu Wudi?! What rights does he have to dismiss my master?!”

“Wangu Wudi might not be the current director of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, but several elders have confidence in him taking up the post after the trial. As such, he has already gained control of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. Everything he says is the law, and none of the elders dare to make a fart in front of him.”

Fart?

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle in amusement. Even Zhao Shu and the others laughed out loud.

Huang Xiaolong continued to ask about his other master, Feng Yang, and his senior martial brother, Liu Yun. He finally relaxed when he learned that they were doing fine.

As they chatted amongst each other, Wangu Changlong and the others were leading an army as they sauntered towards the Abundant Deities Manor.

None of them bothered to conceal their auras, and everyone realized their intentions.

“It’s Wangu Changlong of the Wangu Clan!”

“Wangu Di, Wangu Hanyan, Wangu Suo, Wangu Fei... Wangu Wutan! There are so many elders! All the elders from their Divine Dan City branch are moving out! It seems like they are headed to the Abundant Deities Manor... The Huang Family’s in for it now...”

“Wangi Rui is Wangu Wudi’s nephew! Who else are they going to blame other than the Huang Family? The Huang Family had the chance to submit to the Wangu Clan, but it seems like they have thrown it away!”

Everyone started to discuss among themselves.

With Wangu Changlong in the lead, all the experts from the Wangu Clan charged towards the Abundant Deities Manor with a heated gaze. They exuded an unstoppable aura.

All of a sudden, Wangu Changlong turned to Wangu Hanyan and said, “Get some people to notify the Zhang Family Leader. Get him to bring Zhang Wei and the marriage contract to the Abundant Deities Manor.”

Wangu Hanyan immediately realized Wangu Changlong’s intent.

He wanted to annul the marriage Zhang Wei had to the Huang Family in front of everyone’s eyes. Since the Huang Family had slapped them in the face, he was going to do the same!

“Yes!” Wangu Hanyan acknowledged the order and contacted Zhang Zongyang.

The moment Zhang Zongyang received the order from Wangu Hanyan, he didn’t dare to disobey. He instantly grabbed Zhang Wei and the marriage contract before charging towards the Abundant Deities Manor.

When Wangu Changlong and the others were about to arrive at the Abundant Deities Manor, the Huang Family elders received the news. They ran into the main hall to make their report to Huang Xiaohai.

However, all of them were shocked when they entered the hall and saw an unfamiliar face seated on the throne in the center of the room.

As all of them were promoted after Huang Xiaolong had already ascended, none of them recognized him.

“What’s going on?” Huang Xiaohai asked when he saw everyone charging into the hall in panic.

The elders only snapped back to attention after they heard his question.

“Reporting to Family Head, Wangu Changlong is leading all the experts from the Wangu Clan’s branch in Divine Dan City! There are around a hundred of them!” One of the elders spat out in haste.

Despite the shocking news, Huang Xiaohai merely nodded his head before uttering a single, “Oh.”

All the elders stared at each other in shock.

“Family Head, the Wangu Clan isn’t coming in peace! I have even heard that they want you to hand over Wangu Rui’s killer! They also want you to kneel in front of everyone to admit your mistakes! The Zhang Family’s Leader is also here, and he has brought Zhang Wei with him. They are here to cancel the marriage agreement between our families in front of everyone!” The elder added when he saw that Huang Xiaohai wasn’t taking it seriously.

A frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaohai’s eyes when he heard what the elder said.

Before he could react, a soft laughter emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Nearly a hundred experts? That’s too little. Whatever! We’ll kill Wangu Changlong or whatever his name is before killing Wangu Wudi. When we’re done with Wangu Wudi, we’ll uproot the entire Wangu Clan from their homeland.”

All of the elders felt a bomb going off in their minds when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

They turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a blank expression on their face.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong paid them no heed, and he merely turned to Huang Xiaohai before asking a single question, “I heard that the leader of the Wangu Clan is that little kid, Wangu Yanhui. Is that true?”
