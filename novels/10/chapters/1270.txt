An Ancestor God Realm master no doubt!

“Who dares to kill my sect’s disciple?!” Everyone was guess as to which sect’s Ancestor God Realm master it was, when a thunderous roar reverberated in the air making it feel like even heaven and earth were trembling.

Both Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s faces tightened.

Huang Xiaolong had expected the Short Blade Gate’s Ancestor God Realm masters to rush over because he had killed the peak mid-Eighth Order Ancient God Realm disciple, but he hadn’t expected one to arrive so soon!

However, Chen Jianfeng, and the rest of Short Blade Gate’s disciples were overjoyed.

“Haha, punk, you’re so dead!” Chen Jianfeng pointed at Huang Xiaolong and laughed nastily. But he didn’t laugh for long, as a sword light flashed in the air separating his head from his shoulders.

As Chen Jianfeng’s head dropped to the ground, he was looking at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. Even at this point, he still couldn’t believe that this fat kid had the guts to kill him, despite his sect’s Ancestor God Realm master had arrived.

Huang Xiaolong flicked away the drops of blood from his Mulberry Sword with a turn of his wrist, and coldly said, “What I hate the most in this world, is an ungrateful little scum like you!” He then looked at the rest of Short Blade Gate’s disciples that he had saved before.

The few Short Blade Gate’s disciples turned deathly pale. Just as they tried to run, Huang Xiaolong was like a specter on their heels as sword force formed sharp and howling winds. As these winds blew past them, they froze on the spot and tumbled to the ground. Deep sword cuts completely destroyed their flesh.

Huang Xiaolong collected all their spatial rings, with a wave of his hand.

At this time, another furious roar shook the air. There was a sudden burst of lightning, and in the next second, Shi Long was attacking Huang Xiaolong from the back.

Huang Xiaolong had no plans to retaliate at all. In a flicker, he dodged Shi Long’s attack and leaped onto the little cow’s back.

“GO!”

The little cow swiftly sped away with Huang Xiaolong in a streak of purple lightning, and completely disappeared from the black mountain.

This speed was even faster for a peak late-Ninth Order Ancient God Realm master to chase.

It was the little cow’s natal supreme escape skill called Lightning Bolt. Though the Lightning Bolt consumes energy rapidly, she couldn’t be bothered with it at that moment, as there was no better method to evade the Short Blade Gate’s Ancestor God Realm master.

Shortly after Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had left, a middle-aged man clad in the Short Blade Gate’s Elder armored robe descended on the black mountain, accompanied by thunder and lightning.

“Elder Lin Bi!” Shi Long and other Short Blade Gate’s disciples quickly went up to salute after they saw Lin Bi.

Short Blade Gate’s Elder Lin Bi nodded at them. His gaze swept over the surroundings and his face sank after seeing Chen Jianfeng and other disciples’ corpses. Killing intent roiled within his eyes.

“Who was it?!” He asked sullenly.

"It was a fat kid with a large beast." Shi Long hastened to answer, and then he described Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s looks to Lin Bi. As the little cow had used an illusionary technique, Shi Long described her as a five-horned giant beast.

Lin Bi then asked Shi Long and the others the direction in which Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had fled. His hand ripped space like fabric, then with a Great Space Teleportation, his figure disappeared from the black mountain as he went after Huang Xiaolong.

Whereas, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had fled deeper into the Devil Prison Mountain, instead of going outwards.

Although, the corrosive devil qi would be denser deeper into the Devil Prison Mountain, this element was advantageous to their escape.

The little cow turned into a streak of purple lightning, with Huang Xiaolong on her back, and cut through layers of corrosive devil qi as they escaped deeper into the Devil Prison Mountain. At the same time, aureate light of purification power shone from Huang Xiaolong’s body, as he pushed his Innumerable Buddha Godhead to his limits, and purified the corrosive devil qi along their path to lessen the little cow’s burden.

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong’s face sank.

He sensed the Short Blade Gate’s Ancestor God Realm master tearing through space and getting closer to them. As per his calculations, this Ancestor God Realm master would chase up to them in less than two minutes.

Huang Xiaolong had inwardly praised the little cow’s Lightning Bolt speed, however, the Ancestor God Realm master’s speed had still exceeded his estimation.

The little cow too sensed the Short Blade Gate’s Ancestor God Realm Elder Lin Bi. Layers of purple lightning fire suddenly flowed out from her body. When this purple lightning fire appeared, the little cow accelerated as if she had just been injected with stimulants. From afar, she looked like a glimmering purple fire on the Devil Prison Mountain.

Lin Bi, who was hounding them was utterly shocked. According to Shi Long, the fat kid and his mount were just a bit stronger than him. Thus, based on his own strength, Lin Bi should have been able to catch up with them in a few breaths of time. But now, to the contrary, more than three or four breaths had passed.

However, this only made him more resolute to kill Huang Xiaolong and the little cow. If such a monstrous genius was allowed to grow, and breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm, it’d definitely be a threat to the Short Blade Gate.

“Run, but do you think you can escape from an Ancestor God Realm?” Lin Bi used a nefarious sound technique, trying to befuddle Huang Xiaolong’s mind as he pursued from behind. “If you two submit to my Short Blade Gate, I can spare your lives!”

Lin Bi’s voice clearly passed into Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s ears. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong’s mind shook, making him nearly lose his own will, but the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell emitted silvery moonlight almost immediately. Right away, he returned to his senses; even so, there was a film of cold sweat on his forehead—that was too dangerous!

The little cow’s speed did not slow down at all, and she went zig-zagging into the deeper region of the Devil Prison Mountain. Obviously, Lin Bi’s voice hadn’t affected her at all.

“Kiddo, this Master has eaten more rice than you’ve eaten farts. Your trick is useless against me.” The little cow also employed a sound technique in retaliation, “Wait till I breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm, I’ll pummel you to death.”

‘Eaten more rice than you’ve eaten fart?!’ Huang Xiaolong laughed out loudly.

But Lin Bi was gnashing his teeth. Two measly Ancient God Realm ants still had the mood to joke while being hunted by him, not to mention, they even had the guts to taunt him.

Damn them!

Sword lights burst out from Lin Bi’s body and his speed accelerated. He was now desperately executing consecutive Great Space Teleportation as fast as he could.

Finally, about two minutes later, he saw Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s figures.

“Go die!” A ruthless light gleamed in Lin Bi’s eyes as the long sword in his hand slashed out. A powerful sword light cut through the layers of corrosive devil qi, towards Huang Xiaolong’s back.

This sword attack could easily split a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm master.

The feeling of death gripped Huang Xiaolong’s heart. His face paled, but there was too much at stake here. As his body swayed, he transformed into a primordial divine dragon; a resounding dragon roar reverberated above the Devil Prison Mountain as the dragon might spread out.

His three supreme godheads were spinning at their limits as his dragon claw struck behind him.Almost simultaneously, his primordial divine dragon’s body swerved and dodged the sword attack.

Zheng! Zheng! Zheng!

The sword light missed Huang Xiaolong, piercing into the surrounding mountain ground, leaving a great sword mark.

Still, the impact sent Huang Xiaolong’s primordial divine dragon body tumbling in the air. Dragon scales on his two claws cracked and blood flowed down his claws.

Even though, Huang Xiaolong had transformed into his primordial divine dragon’s body, he was still a mid-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm who was going against an Ancestor God Realm master. The gap in strength was just too big to overcome.

The little cow hastened to Huang Xiaolong’s side, and then grabbed him and bolted away.

“En?!!” Lin Bi was astonished that this fat kid had suddenly turned into a primordial divine dragon. To top it off, this fat kid was still alive after he was impacted by his sword!
