Chapter 53: Bet

Huang Xiaolong’s brows were knitted together. Nonetheless, he still stood up.

Li Lu beside him was full of worry.

“What were you laughing at?” Xiong Meiqi snapped curtly in anger.

A faint smile curved up at the corner of Huang Xiaolong’s lips, “I laughed because it was such a crappy battle skill yet everyone was cheering so much.”

“What?!” anger rose to Xiong Meiqi’s face, “You, a waste with a recommendation letter, are not qualified to judge others’ battle skill.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered and retorted, “I have no qualification to judge? Then what right do you have to say I’m a waste, you female bear.”

Female bear?

Everyone’s face had an excited expression of anticipation seeing that Huang Xiaolong had dared to call Xiong Meiqi a female bear in front of so many students.

“You!” Xiong Meiqi immediately flared up with anger, a finger pointed at Huang Xiaolong as her voluptuous bosom was heaving up and down, “Fine, fine, you won’t admit that you’re a waste. Three days later, there is an assessment test for new students, if you can enter top ten then I will admit that you’re not a useless waste!”

Top ten in the assessment test, this condition was a bit too much.

Despite that, Huang Xiaolong just laughed, “Do I need your acknowledgment whether I am useless or not? Okay, if I enter one of the top ten spots in the assessment test, I want you to growl three times like a bear, kneeling down in the Academy’s square!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Growl three times like a bear!

A sharp, dangerous glint sparked deep within Xiong Meiqi’s pupils as if she wanted to swallow Huang Xiaolong alive; gritting her teeth, “What if you fail to enter one of the top ten places?”

“If I fail, I will voluntarily withdraw from school and also will kneel down in the Academy’s square and bark like a dog three times!” Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice sounded.

Xiong Meiqi gloomy face changed indecisively.

“How about it, don’t you dare to?” Huang Xiaolong smirked.

“Okay!” Xiong Meiqi bit her lips and agreed, a ruthless light flitted across her eyes and disappeared quickly. She simply refused to believe that a waste relying on a family’s background could enter into one of the top ten spots in the assessment!

Seeing that Xiong Meiqi agreed through gritted teeth, Huang Xiaolong sneered inside and walked in the direction of the classroom door.

“Stand still, where are you going?” Xiong Meiqi yelled.

“Do I have to tell you where I go?” Huang Xiaolong paused when he heard that and continued to step out of the classroom, but when he passed beside Jiang Teng, Huang Xiaolong muttered: “A self-righteous idiot!”

Jiang Teng’s face stiffened, then turned red when he understood the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words. A waste that came in through recommendation actually scolded him, calling him an idiot publicly? A strong light flickered around his body, burning with rage as he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s back.

Looking at the receding figure that ignored him and choking with anger that he failed to vent.

Walking out from the classroom, Huang Xiaolong headed to the library. After all, it made no difference whether he sat in class or otherwise. In fact, he felt it was better this way– he could head to the library to find out the information he wanted.

The library was far from Xiaolong’s classroom. Entering the library, he took out his student token for verification. After passing the verification, he searched for the shelf containing books about martial spirits, and randomly picked up a book titled 《Types of Martial Spirits》 and started to read.

This book basically described the many different types of martial spirits and some of the innate supernatural abilities they possessed.

Huang Xiaolong’s memory had always been excellent, flipping past the pages at rapid speed, moments later he had finished reading and gained some understanding to this world’s martial spirits.

After 《Types of Martial Spirits》, Huang Xiaolong took a book called 《The Different Martial Spirits Grades》 that evaluated the distinction between the grades of martial spirits and their cultivation progress.

“Ah, twin martial spirits!” when he reached the last page there were some notations about twin martial spirits that Huang Xiaolong read carefully, paying extra attention.

“Twin martial spirits of the same kind can combine to become one or they could be separated as two individual entities!” This paragraph astonished Huang Xiaolong.

Twin martial spirits can become one?!

No wonder in the early days when his martial spirits had just awakened, it existed in a combined state! When he broke through to the Fourth Order, his twin dragon martial spirits separated into two independent entities.

Huang Xiaolong read the passage below and his eyes lit up; it actually described the method to combine and separate twin martial spirits of the same kind.

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong finished the book feeling elated; great! With this method, he could combine his martial spirits before releasing them in the future so that no one could guess his secret.

He re-read the paragraph explaining the method, committing each word into his brain, before moving on towards the shelves that held books about Beasts language text.

Following the Beast language patterns on the map he had gotten in the Silvermoon Forest, he checked them one by one. Soon, he successfully deciphered the text written on the Beast Cultivator’s treasure map.

“Demon Beast Holy Land, Thousand Tusker Mountain, Windless Tunnel!”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

The location of the treasure was actually in the Beast race Holy Land?!

In this world, the Demon Beast race was bigger and more powerful than the normal Beastmen, and they abhorred humans; wanting to enter their Holy Land, this was too difficult! At least it was impossible for the current Xiaolong.

After he had finished translating the words, it was already high noon. Huang Xiaolong left the library, and he exited the Academy instead of returning to the classroom. When he came out from the Academy, Fei Hou and the three guards immediately saw him and hurried to his side: “Young Master!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Come on, let’s go.” he brought the four of them to Tianxuan Mansion.

On the way, Fei Hou couldn’t resist, so he asked: “Young Master, the Academy hasn’t ended, how come you’re already out?”

The other four guards also looked at Huang Xiaolong with curiosity, having the same doubt in their hearts.

Huang Xiaolong explained, “That female bear from the registration day is my class teacher.”

“What?! That female bear is Young Master’s class teacher?!” Fei Hou was stupefied, then his voice turned sullen as he asked “Young Master, did she make things difficult for you today in the class?”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Some ridicule is unavoidable.” Then, Huang Xiaolong summarized what happened and his bet with Xiong Mei in the new students’ assessment three days later.

When Fei Hou heard it couldn’t resist laughing out loud– he already could imagine three days later, Xiong Meiqi kneeling on the square and growling like a bear.

Soon, the six of them arrived in Tianxuan Mansion. Beastman Boli and the rest of the slaves saw Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou, so they hurried to salute; telling them to stand up, Xiaolong went to the main hall and asked Boli about Tianxuan Mansion’s recent progress and problems.

Beastman Boli answered them one by one with respect.

In the last few days, the necessary furniture was arranged accordingly and the open yard was planted with flowers and plants; Beastman Boli even arranged for the old and moldy walls to be scrapped and painted with a new layer of paint.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “You did well, you can leave.”

Acknowledging respectfully, Beastman Boli turned and brought the servants with him out of the main hall.

After that, Xiaolong left Tianxuan Mansion and returned to the Marshal’s Mansion. Suddenly, a question popped out from Xiaolong’s mouth, “Fei Hou, do you want to breakthrough to the Xiantian realm?”

“Breakthrough to the Xiantian realm?” Fei Hou was stunned, stammering, “Sov- Sovereign, you have a way?”
