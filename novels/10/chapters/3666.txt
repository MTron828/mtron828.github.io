Chapter 3667 – Green Ghost Continent

Huang Xiaolong could also tell that she had probably reached the small completion in both elements!

In a short two million years, Tao Han’er was able to improve so quickly! Hard work had a part to play, but her talent was a much greater factor! Also, the reason she could comprehend the power of time and space so quickly was because Jian Wushuang’s Unparalleled Sword Manual contained both elements.

“I’m going to look for Zhu Chen and I’m also planning to go to the Dragon Lands after. It won’t be convenient for you to follow me this time.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head.

Tao Han’er’s gaze dimmed slightly.

“Next time.” Huang Xiaolong added. “When I return, I’ll bring you to the Fengdu City if you wish to experience life there.”

“Really?!” Tao Han’er’s eyes lit up again.

“Of course.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

“Alright! We’ll pinky promise!” Tao Han’er jumped in excitement and she stretched out her slender finger.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly and he hooked pinkies with her.

It had been a long time since he had heard of a pinky promise.

“Lord, if you have nothing else left to do, let’s go out for a walk!” Tao Han’er asked.

Looking at her smile, he couldn’t refuse. He nodded slowly. “Alright. I’ve been in the Zhu Lan City for so long but I haven’t got the chance to explore it!”

“Me too, me too! I won’t be able to find my way around if I went alone…” Tao Han’er bounced up and down like a little excited child.

“Then… I’ll get Zhu Ji to bring us around? He should be familiar with his city.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“No!” Tao Han’er refused immediately. “The two of us are more than enough! We won’t get lost anyway…” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong snickered silently in response, “Sure. Let’s go then!”

The two of them left the palace and went strolling around the streets of the city.

Huang Xiaolong stayed for a few more days, and he would bring Tao Han’er around the city when the sun was up. At night, he would look for Jian Wushuang, Zhu Ji, and the experts who had broken through the 10 billion units mark to exchange pointers. Even though it had only been a few days, Huang Xiaolong gained some understanding of their special techniques.

Several days later…

Huang Xiaolong left the city under the respectful gazes of Zhu Ji and the rest. As for Tao Han’er, she hid in a corner of the palace and she looked at Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure.

He eventually disappeared into the horizon.

After leaving the city, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Universe Boat. The distance between the Zhu Lan Lands and the Green Ghost Lands was enormous! He needed countless years in order to arrive.

Sitting in the formation in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong started to comprehend the secret arts of the various experts.

Through the exchange he had with them in the past few days, he managed to comprehend quite a bit!

Unknowingly, countless years passed.

The Universe Boat crossed several large continents and he arrived at the Green Ghost Lands!

Standing on top of the Universe Boat, he looked at the vast land mass below.

After entering the Green Ghost Lands, Huang Xiaolong realized that everything around him had turned a dull shade of gray. The sunlight that illuminated the other continents was nowhere to be seen.

There were also occasional roars coming from the distance.

The Green Ghost Lands and the Land of Death were the two most messy continents in the Unknown Lands. One could witness battles going on everywhere, and there was no such thing as law. Cultivators who were traveling around would run into ghosts ever so often.

The ghosts they ran into were called Yin Ghosts, and they were ghost-like creatures with human features. They used something called ghost energy, and they were extremely afraid of sunlight.

Of course, yin ghosts weren’t the only creatures that populated the Green Ghost Lands. There were human races who lived there too. Seventy percent of the population of the Green Ghost Lands was made up of yin ghosts, twenty percent was made up of humans, and the last ten percent was made up of some weird creatures called ghost beasts.

The beasts born in the Green Ghost Lands wielded ghost energy and they greatly resembled ghosts, hence the name.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaoong to see a massive city. After thinking about it, he kept his Universe Boat and descended.

“Nanfeng City…” Huang Xiaolong looked at the plaque on the city gates before walking in.

The city wasn’t as deserted as Huang Xiaolong had thought. It was comparable to the large cities in the Limitless Lands and the Zhu Lan Lands. The city was bustling, and there were many people strolling about! The buildings in the city weren’t weird at all! Inns, shops, entertainment pavilions, they had it all!

The only difference from the other regions was that the city was shrouded in a gray mist. There wasn’t a trace of sunlight, resulting in a type of oppressive atmosphere.

“I heard that the Yin Ghost River is starting to flood!”

“What?! The Yin Ghost River that had remained dry for billions of years finally started to fill up!”

“Yeah! The city master of our Nanfeng City and the city masters all around are heading there as we speak! I heard that many Ghost Kings and even Lord Nether Yang King have started to make their way there!”

“Even Lord Nether Yang King has been alerted!”

The master of the Green Ghost Lands was the Green Ghost, and Gui Chi was the sole expert under him. There were ten great kings under Gui Chi, and the Nether Yang King was one of them!

“The flooding of the Yin Ghost River is an amazing opportunity! We have to go there!”

“Heh… It’s not that easy to enter the river. I’m just a Dao Venerable who comprehended two elements to the grand completion stage. If something goes wrong, I’ll turn into a yin spirit that roams the river forever!”

The discussion from the cultivators around him entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise. Yin Ghost River?

He knew about it. It was one of the secret regions of the Unknown Lands. It would only fill up every few billion years, and the water that filled it would be yin spirit waster!

When that happened, anyone who could cross the river to reach the other side would be able to obtain a rare treasure! There were legends of people who comprehended supreme techniques after reaching the other side, and there were some who obtained rare treasures!

Huang Xiaolong stopped the cultivators of several great families and tossed over several grand dao pills to ask about the matters regarding the river.

After receiving the pills, they revealed everything they knew!

“Lord, are you headed to the Yin Ghost River too?” One person in the crowd laughed. “If you don’t mind, I can bring you there!”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the man from the corner of his eye and agreed. “Sure.”

As such, the two of them left the city for the Yin Ghost River.
