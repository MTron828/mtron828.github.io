The middle-aged looking Grandmist Emperor shuddered and stared at the little cow in disbelief. This cow ancestor?

Could it be?

“You, are you S-Senior Azure Cow?!” The Grandmist Emperor’s voice quivered with excitement.

Senior Azure Cow!!!!!

Hearing the Grandmist Emperor’s salutation for the little cow. Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the rest felt their knees softened, stumbling to the ground. Fortunately, their reflex actions were not too bad, hence they managed to steady themselves in midair.

Watching these people’s reactions, the little cow proudly puffed up her chest and blew air out from her nostrils. “Kiddo Grandmist, your strength has improved greatly within the last several hundred million years since I saw you the last time. Your Grandmist Parasitic Medium must have broken through to the eight level, am I right?”

Meanwhile, after confirming the little cow’s ‘identity,’ the Grandmist Emperor’s demeanor towards the little cow changed completely. He was no longer so calm and unfathomable, but he appeared extremely respectful as he answered, “Yes, Senior Azure Cow’s eyes are as bright and keen as always. Jiang Hong happened to advance to the eighth level Grandmist Parasitic Medium several thousand years ago!”

Jiang Hong was the Grandmist Emperor’s given name.

The little cow’s eyes lit up immediately, but maintained the dignity of an elder as she spoke, “Not bad, not bad, no one in the universe is your match at your current strength.”

The Grandmist Emperor quickly but humbly replied, “Jiang Hong’s meager strength is not worthy of Senior Azure Cow’s praise.” At this time, he had already understood why the black-haired young man knew about the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. In the past, Senior Azure Cow and his Master, the King of Grandmist had made a bet, which Senior Azure Cow had won, thus winning the Grandmist Parasitic Medium’s entire cultivation technique manual.

But Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong had a doubt. Since Senior Azure Cow has passed on the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to this black-haired young man, what is his connection with Senior Azure Cow?

Moreover, this black-haired young man has a darkness element godhead! No wonder Senior Azure Cow would fancy him.

Since this black-haired young man has successfully cultivated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium in a certain aspect, that means he’s...?!

His Junior Brother!

“Little brat Huang, what are you doing standing there in a daze? Your Senior Brother is here, quickly go greet him.” The little cow bombarded Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong finally recovered from the shocking truth that this middle-aged man standing in front of him was the Grandmist Emperor.

“Senior Brother.” Huang Xiaolong took a step and greeted Jiang Hong. His manners were a little stiff. After all, the person in front of him was the Divine World’s number one Emperor Palace force’s big shot, hailed as the Divine World’s strongest person.

The Grandmist Emperor chuckled amiably as he stepped forward to help Huang Xiaolong up. “Junior Brother need not stand on ceremony. I must say this is a pleasant surprise, how many billion years have passed, at last, the third person who has successfully cultivated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium has appeared. Master would be over the moon when he hears this good news.” Grandmist Emperor was trembling with excitement by the end of his sentence.

He was genuinely happy. His Master, the King of Grandmist, had been hoping to see a third person who would successfully cultivate the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. While he had hoped and looked forward with anticipation, several hundred million years had gone by! How many years exactly, even he could not remember.

Finally, now, this third person has appeared!

Moreover, this person’s relationship with Senior Azure Cow seemingly runs deep.

“Senior Azure Cow, my Junior Brother and you are...?” Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong couldn’t resist asking the little cow. He was truly curious about the relationship between the little cow and Huang Xiaolong.

“He is my Master.” The little cow had no thoughts of concealing anything, but sounded slightly depressed.

“Mas-Master?!” Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong froze on the spot with a silly expression on his face. Seconds later, he stared at Huang Xiaolong with a shocked and somewhat strange expression on his face.

This new Junior Brother of his, i-is, is, Senior Azure Cow’s Master?!

But-but-but, how-how-how?!

“I say Kiddo Grandmist, what’s so shocking about this.” The little cow scoffed. “An accident happened to this cow ancestor in the past, so I reincarnated and cultivated again from scratch. I somehow ended up in this kid’s hands and made a blood contract. He is your Junior Brother, just call him how you should.”

The Grandmist Emperor was speechless by these turn of events. His gaze turned a little complicated as he looked at Huang Xiaolong while thinking inwardly, ‘This Junior Brother’s luck is a little too good...’

He knew how shocking Senior Azure Cow’s real identity was.

In the tens of thousands of worlds surfaces, existences that could stand on the same level as his Master, the King of Grandmist, could be counted in one hand, and Senior Azure Cow was one of them.

“Kiddo Grandmist, is your Master doing well in recent years?” The little cow asked sincerely.

Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong replied respectfully, “Many thanks for Senior Azure Cow’s concern. Master has been in seclusion in recent years, attempting to advance to the tenth level of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. I also hardly see him these days, and I would like to see him more.” His tone lightened as he said, “If Master learns Junior Brother has successfully cultivated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, he would surely be very happy and come out of seclusion earlier to see Junior Brother.”

But the little cow said, “Old Man Grandmist still doesn’t plan to give up after so many years? Is the tenth level of Grandmist Parasitic Medium easy to advance? And if it was that easy, why would he be stuck at ninth level for so long.”

The Grandmist Emperor smiled wryly at her words.

Had it been someone else who had uttered these words in front of him, he would have reduced that person into dust without a word.

But Jiang Hong knew that the little cow was merely being frank. It was simply difficult to advance to the tenth level of Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

Like him, he had happened to advance to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium eighth level only by chance several thousand years ago. Otherwise, who knows when he would have reached the eighth level. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Your Master might not be able to do it, but this brat here probably can.” The little cow pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong looked blankly at the little cow. His Junior Brother would be able to reach the tenth level of Grandmist Parasitic Medium? He suspected he might have heard wrong. The Grandmist Parasitic Medium was created by his Master, even so, his Master had yet to step into the tenth level, so how could his Junior Brother do so?

Looking at the obvious doubt on Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong’s face, the little cow was not angry at all. Instead, she asked, “Do you know how long Xiaolong took to cultivate the first level of Grandmist Parasitic Medium?”

Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong had not expected such a question. He knew his Master, the King of Grandmist, had spent over a thousand years to fully comprehend the first level. Judging from Senior Azure Cow’s tone of voice, it sounded as if his Junior Brother had spent less time than that, was it?

“Is Senior Azure Cow trying to say that Junior Brother has succeeded in cultivating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium’s first level in a mere several hundred years?” Jiang Hong responded with a question of his own.

Several hundred years? Not possible.

"Hehe, several hundred years? Aren’t you underestimating your Junior Brother too much? Xiaolong used less than a hundred years to master the first level of Grandmist Parasitic Medium.”

“What? Less than a hundred years!” Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong exclaimed in astonishment. Even though he was aware that the little cow would not make a joke of this sort with her identity, it was too unbelievable for him.

He looked at Huang Xiaolong, trying to get a confirmation from him as well.

Huang Xiaolong shyly nodded his head in confirmation.

Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong’s heart raced after getting Huang Xiaolong’s confirmation. Others might not understand what that represented...

“More accurately, he succeeded in less than fifty years!” The little cow looked like she was addicted to shocking Jiang Hong.

Less than fifty years!

Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong’s eyes were wide as plates.

The little cow continued, “He’s now at the peak of the second level of Grandmist Parasitic Medium, guess how long he spent to get there?”

“Maybe, only ten thousand years?” Jiang Hong took a guess. His breathing was slightly uneven.

The little cow shook her head, “Only several hundred years. More accurately, less than three hundred years!”

Less than three hundred years! The words sounded like a thunderclap in Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong’s mind. He was completely and utterly astounded by this information.
