Huang Xiaolong diligently cultivated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium as much as possible before arriving at the Land of Penalty. Jiang Hong was also cultivating inside one of the Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s cultivation rooms.

Inside the cultivation room, Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars sat cross-legged, all running the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

Above Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars were a hundred top-grade chaos spiritual pills, one hundred dragon pearls, one hundred dragon crystals, and one thousand Fortune Divine Fruits.

Based on Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars’ current strength, their refining speed had reached a super terrifying degree.

These one hundred top-grade chaos spiritual pills, one hundred dragon pearls, one hundred dragon crystals, and one thousand Fortune Divine Fruits were merely the amount of energy Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars absorbed in a day.

As Huang Xiaolong circulated his godforce according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, robust medicinal energy flooded out from the one hundred top-grade chaos spiritual pills. At the same time, pure dragon’s true essence energy and blood essence energy roared out from the dragon pearls and dragon crystals, and dots of fortune energy flowed out from the one thousand Fortune Divine Fruits.

These medicinal energies, dragon’s true essence energy and blood essence energy, and fortune energy all rushed towards Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars’ bodies.

While Huang Xiaolong devoured these medicinal energies and dragon’s essence energies, the purple grandmist dragon inside his godsea also emitted consistent waves of purple grandmist aura energy into his three supreme godheads.

Inside the cultivation room, Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars were enshrouded in mesmerizing purple lights.

......

One month later...

Huang Xiaolong ended his cultivation and stepped out of the cultivation room and headed to the flying ship’s control hall.

“Master!” Seeing Huang Xiaolong walk into the control hall, Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel respectfully saluted.

“We’re close to arriving at the Land of Lightning Penalty, right?” Huang Xiaolong asked, the corner of his eye glanced in Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the other Barbarians Head Chieftains.

“We’ll be there soon!” Lei Budong nodded and went on, “In less than half an hour!” He was trembling slightly due to excitement. Yes ah, they’re close to the Land of the Lightning Penalty. It wasn’t as if he had not been here in the past. He had made this journey no less than a hundred times, but there had never been once he was this agitated. He couldn’t help feeling excited.

Lei Budong looked at Huang Xiaolong, inwardly thinking, this black-haired young man, could he really take them out of this space?!

He was not the only person wondering this same thing. Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, Guang Wenfang, and the rest were also wondering the same thing.

The entire Barbarian race had been waiting for this moment for far too long.

Upon hearing that there was less than half an hour until they arrived at the Land of Lightning Penalty, Huang Xiaolong began to look forward to it.

The Land of Lightning Penalty was a place that spawned chaos divine lightning. The land was covered by chaos divine lightning throughout the year and this was a rare phenomenon in itself. Could the other end be a source of chaos divine lightning?!

One of the nine chaos lightning pools?!

Huang Xiaolong’s speculation was very likely possible!

At this time, Jiang Hong, the little cow, Feng Er, and several others also came out from their respective cultivation rooms.

In a short moment, everyone was gathered in the control hall, talking and laughing in a relaxed atmosphere.

Before they knew it, roughly half an hour went by.

The Dragon Shark Flying Ship stopped in midair.

Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong, and the rest disembarked from the Dragon Shark Flying Ship, looking ahead. Several thousand meters in front of them was a dusty, barren land that stretched into the horizon. Other than brown earth, they could barely see any other colors.

Huang Xiaolong’s group was astounded. The dusty, hazy sight in front of them was actually chaos divine lightning!

Earth element chaos divine lightning!

Earth element chaos divine lightning was extremely rare, thus none of them had expected to see it here, that too on this scale!

How big exactly was the Land of Lightning Penalty?

“Not right...” The little cow said suddenly. Her eyes squinted as she observed the Land of Lightning Penalty a little more.

In truth, she too had thought that the Land of Lightning Penalty was probably one of the nine chaos lightning pools, but now, seeing the sight in front of her, she found that her guess was wrong. Now, she was certain that the earth element chaos divine lightning in front of them was not part of the nine chaos lightning pools.

Like the little cow, Huang Xiaolong also realized that his previous guess was wrong, and he couldn’t help feeling a pang of disappointment.

“Little Brat Huang, act quick. Even though it’s not one of the nine chaos lightning pools, absorbing this earth element chaos divine lightning would bring lots of benefits to you.” The little cow urged Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and pulled himself together, then flew forward.

As the rest watched from afar, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the border of the dusty land.

Huang Xiaolong’s supreme godforce activated the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation. Immediately, the power of chaos golden dragon lightning roared throughout his body and condensed into tiny golden dragons, inches above the skin of his body.

Jiang Hong and Lei Budong were astounded at this sight. Ecstasy dominated Lei Budong’s expression as he stared at Huang Xiaolong with burning eyes. More accurately, he was staring at the golden dragons condensed from chaos divine lightning close to Huang Xiaolong’s body.

This...! Chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool?!

It must be!

It was exactly the power described in the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s legend!

As the others watched with astonished eyes, Huang Xiaolong stepped over the boundary, into the Land of Lightning Penalty.

The moment Huang Xiaolong took the first step, he immediately felt great resistance and heavy gravity.

The heavy gravity of this earth element chaos divine lightning was something Huang Xiaolong had never experienced in the past. He exerted full force to channel his supreme godforce into the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation.

The golden dragons around Huang Xiaolong were spinning at high speed, forming small golden dragon lightning vortices that sucked in the earth element chaos divine lightning. From these golden dragon lightning vortices, the earth element chaos divine lightning flooded into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Huang Xiaolong’s three supreme godheads were emitting coruscating lights that were not visible to the others.

It wasn’t long before Huang Xiaolong felt the heavy gravitational pull lighten, and it finally became nonexistent to him. He was elated and he accelerated as he continued to proceed further inside.

As the Barbarians’ hearts hung high in suspense, Huang Xiaolong’s figure gradually disappeared into the hazy barren land.

“Elder Brother Lei, you say, can he really succeed?” Guang Wenfang couldn’t help asking.

Lei Budong took a deep breath before replying in a solemn voice, “He probably could.” However, inwardly, he wasn’t feeling so certain. Although Huang Xiaolong possibly had the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool out of the nine chaos lightning pools, and it was described to be unimaginably powerful in the legends, Huang Xiaolong’s strength was still in the God King Realm. How much of the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s power Huang Xiaolong could employ was unknown!

At this point though, they had no other choice other than putting all his hopes in that black-haired young man.

While everyone waited in suspense, Huang Xiaolong advanced step by step. Each step was slow but steady and firm. Several hours later, he had traversed three thousand zhang across the Land of Lightning Penalty.

At this point, the dusty earth scenery had changed into blurry gray chaos divine lightning. Huang Xiaolong had no idea from where this gray chaos divine lightning had come from, and it was seemingly infinite. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong persisted on, taking one step in front of another. When he was ten ten thousand zhang from it, he finally stopped for the first time.

“This should be the center of this lightning land.” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. Based on his sense, the spot where he stood was filled with the richest chaos divine lightning power akin to bubbling water. This was the very center of the lightning land.

Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged on the spot. He began circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium and increased the power of the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning at the same time, in order to absorb the surroundings’ chaos divine lightning.
