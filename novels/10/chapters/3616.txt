Chapter 3617: Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, Rong Hua!

 

When Huang Xiaolong arrived, the place was bustling with activity.

Even though not everyone had the qualifications to enter, there were many experts who had comprehended thirteen elements in the Limitless Land. There were also many celestial emperors among them and they were qualified to receive an entry plaque.

Countless flying ships or chariots could be seen all around the giant plaza.

They were all extremely rare treasures and wouldn’t be seen in the outside world. However, they were like cabbages growing by the side of the street.

All of them were at the creation artifact level, and there were even several mid-grade creation artifacts among them.

There weren’t many people like Huang Xiaolong who walked into the plaza.

Moreover, everyone there had tons of bodyguards surrounding them. Huang Xiaolong was a lonely expert who came all by himself.

“Which family did that kid come from? Why did he come alone?” 

Huang Xiaolong’s solo presence was too eye-catching. With his aura, he managed to attract the attention of many young ladies. Those who had the qualifications to enter the night market were definitely princesses of the various celestial empires or young ladies of the super families. Also, most of them had yet to marry.

Many young masters and young ladies went to the night market in order to look for a partner. After all, those there were probably of equal status.

The person who spoke previously was the sixth young lady of the Chen Family in the Limitless Celestial Empire, Chen Hui.

The old ancestor of the Chen Family was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. That made them part of the larger families in the city. However, they were far from being a top power in the Limitless Land.

“This young man is either a supreme expert, or he’s some loser in his family. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be alone.” One of the pretty ladies beside her chuckled.

The pretty lady was Chen Hui’s second aunt, Yang Rong. She was someone important since she could marry into the Chen Family and she was the daughter of the Yang Family’s patriarch. The Yang Family was stronger than the Chen Family as the old ancestor of the Yang Family was a God of Creation closing in on the half step Universe God Realm.

Yang Rong smiled, “The Sixth Miss rejected so many young masters… Are you actually interested in that young man? I’ll look into him when we get back…”

Chen Hui pouted slightly in response, “No I’m not! Second Aunt, you can’t make fun of me!” However, her eyes darted around mischievously and she continued, “However, I think it’s a great idea to look into his identity.”

Yang Rong giggled slightly. “I knew it.” 

Chen Hui’s face started to turn slightly red and she widened her eyes slightly, “I’m just slightly curious… That’s all…”

“Why don’t we say hello and shop around with him?” Yang Rong muttered.

“That… That… It’s too awkward!” Chen Hui shook her head and sighed.

Just like that, Huang Xiaolong had no idea he entered Chen Hui’s radar.

When Huang Xiaolong tried to enter the night market, a random youngster appeared before him and bowed respectfully. “Lord, I wonder if you would mind if I tagged along with you…”

Anyone with an entry plaque could bring two attendants with them into the night market.

Glancing at the youngster, Huang Xiaolong could see the look of determination in his eyes. The kid seemed like a good man and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask, “Which family are you from? Why do you wish to enter the night market?”

It went without saying that the youngster didn’t have his own entry plaque.

“I am a disciple of the Gui Family in the Limitless City… I’m called Gui Xiaoer.” The young man replied instantly. “I wish to enter the night market in order to buy a bone from an ice dragon. It’s extremely important that I get the ingredient, but I don’t have a way to enter the night market alone…”

“Gui Xiaoer?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Your name is pretty unique… Alright. I’ll bring you in because you make me laugh.” 

Gui Xiaoer was stunned. However, wild joy filled his heart in the next instant. He bowed to Huang Xiaolong to express his thanks. He begged many experts of other families only to face rejection at every corner. Even if they were willing to bring him in, they wanted a hundred million dao coins as compensation. The Gui Family was one of the third rate families in the city and there was no way they could find a hundred million dao coins even if they sold off everything they had.

Following behind Huang Xiaolong, Gui Xiaoer entered the night market.

When Chen Hui saw what happened, she muttered to herself, “That young man is really kind…” 

Yang Rong giggled. “Let’s enter the night market. If you’re too shy to bump into him, I’ll do it for you.”

Chen Hui jumped in fright and she quickly pulled Yang Rong by her sleeves, “Second Aunt… Let’s not do that…”

“Nonsense! Everyone has the right to love. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. After all, you’re not a married woman!” After speaking, Yang Rong pulled Chen Hui into the plaza.

After Huang Xiaolong and Gui Xiaoer entered the night market, Huang Xiaolong explained, “Your ice dragon bone should be somewhere on the first level. You can look for it yourself. I’ll be heading up to the second level.”

Those on the first floor usually dealt with ordinary herbs at the creation level. As such, Huang Xiaolong needed to go higher in order to look for universe-level spiritual veins.

“Yes. Many thanks to the lord for bringing me in.” Gui Xiaoer thanked Huang Xiaolong from the bottom of his heart. “May I please know your last name? I’ll definitely pay you back in the future.”

“There’s no need for that.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and waved his hand slightly. He started to head up to the second floor after speaking.

However, someone called out to him before he could enter the formation to bring him up. “Young Master, please wait!” 

The person who spoke was Yang Rong and she dragged Chen Hui along with her as they made their way towards Huang Xiaolong.

When they arrived, Yang Rong smiled, “We saw how you helped the disciple of the Gui Family previously. It’s rare to meet someone as nice as you and we’re wondering which family you’re from!” 

She introduced herself before Huang Xiaolong could say anything. “You can call me Yang Rong. I’m from the Chen Family in the Limitless City. This is the sixth miss from the family.” 

Chen Hui looked at Huang Xiaolong and she felt the words getting stuck in her throat. She lowered her head slightly and she didn’t dare to look into Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Chuckling slightly, Huang Xiaolong introduced himself. “As it turns out, you’re members of the Chen Family! You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master.”

“Could you be someone from the Lan Family?” Yang Rong’s eyes lit up and she asked.

The Lan Family was one of the top tier families in the celestial empire. The old ancestor of the Lan Family was a God of Creation who was at the peak of the grand completion stage!

If Huang Xiaolong was really someone from the Lan Family, he would be more than qualified to ask for Chen Hui’s hand in marriage!

Chen Hui was no different as her eyes sparkled.

“Nope. I’m just a wandering cultivator.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Wandering cultivator? Chen Hui and Yang Rong were equally stunned at the news. They couldn’t help sigh silently.

However, Yang Rong’s smile quickly returned to her face and she continued, “Are you here alone? Where are your subordinates? What about your elders?” She was evidently no longer as interested in him after learning about his background.

“My elders didn’t follow me over. However, my subordinates are somewhere in the city. I didn’t bring them along with me today.”

“How did you get your entry plaque then?” Yang Rong couldn’t help but ask.

“I got my subordinates to look for one…” 

“Are your subordinates experts who have comprehended all thirteen elements?” Chen Hui, who had been standing silently at the side, asked all of a sudden.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

If they were, Huang Xiaolong would definitely be someone important.

“Of course not. They’re not Dao Venerables. Hahaha, even so, I think you’ve heard of them.” A mischievous smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Oh? They should be pretty famous then? I wonder what their names are…” Yang Rong played along.

“Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on hiding their identities.
