Chapter 3662: Conclusion

The deadline of a month quickly arrived. There was only a single hour left till the Heavenly Peak closed, and a disturbance occurred on the one-hundredth step!Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Someone is breaking through to the God of Creation Realm!” Everyone looked at the platform in disbelief!

“It’s Young Master Chen Bi from the Feihong Celestial Empire! This is his third time ascending the mountain and he finally broke through!” Someone yelled.

The voice quickly traveled across the lands and Ancestor Chen Bi caught wind of the news.

Joy filled Ancestor Chen Bi’s heart and he roared with laughter, “Nice! My Chen Family will finally have its second God of Creation!”

There was a legend in the Unknown Lands. When a second God of Creation appears in the family, they will definitely be able to give birth to the third and fourth! Their family would only grow stronger and stronger!

The old ancestors around Ancestor Chen Bi congratulated him.

“Brother Chen, congratulations! Your Chen Family needs to hold a celebration after you return!”

“Of course!”

The smile on Ancestor Chen Bi’s face grew wider and wider.

At that moment, Chen Bi felt the grand cosmos energy in his body rolling about and excitement bubbled in his heart. He finally broke through!

He could finally be ranked among the strongest cultivators in the Unknown Lands!

The difference between a Dao Venerable at the peak level and a God of Creation might be small, but the difference in status was huge! One would only be revered after breaking through to the God of Creation Realm!

Another hour passed in the blink of an eye and the Heavenly Peak ascension ended.

A mysterious power that seemed to come from the universe origin sent them back to the foot of the mountain. Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, and even Huang Xiaolong were sent back to the bottom.

Jian Wushuang and the others quickly gathered around Huang Xiaolong.

A somber expression hung on Gui Chi’s face. It seemed as though his attempt to breakthrough had failed.

In contrast, the subtle smile that hung on Jian Wushuang’s face showed that he gained quite a lot during his trip.

“Your Highness, how is it?” Yu Xiaohong hesitated for a moment before asking.

Jian Wushuang and the rest were equally as curious.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “Reaching the peak is harder than I thought!”

Before he tried, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could do what the Ferocious Devil couldn’t! However, one month proved to be too short! He couldn’t even see the peak, much less reach it! He needed to ascend at least ten more steps before arriving at the top!

There was a rumor going around the Unknown Lands that even though the Ferocious Devil failed to reach the top, he caught a glance of the peak!

That alone told Huang Xiaolong that he was still a distance away from the Ferocious Devil.

It didn’t seem too bad if they thought about it logically. The Ferocious Devil was a supreme overlord who existed since eons ago! It made sense for him to be much stronger than Huang Xiaolong who hadn’t been cultivating for a fraction of the time he had!

Regardless of what happened, Huang Xiaolong had absolute confidence that he would be able to climb to the peak the next time the Heavenly Peak opened!

He wanted to use the chance to break through to the Universe God Realm!

“Where’s Han’er?” Huang Xiaolong asked Jian Wushuang all of a sudden.

All of them finally realized that Tao Han’er wasn’t with them, and they looked at each other in confusion.

Their expressions sank when they noticed a group of disciples of the Zhu Family harassing her in the distance.

They weren’t anyone else, but Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan!

Tao Han’er glared at them and she growmed, “What do you want?!”

Zhu Ding laughed sinisterly, “What do we want? Young Lady Han’er, you will soon find out. Hehe…”

Coincidentally, Zhu Yuan caught sight of Huang Xiaolong and the others from the corner of his eye and he nudged Zhu Ding, “That brat and his slaves are here. I’ll call for Lord Zhu Chenlong right now!”

Zhu Ding turned around and a sneer formed on his face. Zhu Yuan crushed the talisman in his hand to notify their doyen.

When Huang Xiaolong and gang were walking towards Zhu Yuan and Zhu Ding, the disciples of the Chen Family noticed them as well. They quickly reported the discovery to Chen Bi and Ancestor Chen Bi.

At that moment, Ancestor Chen Bi was with Ancestor Du Chengjiang and Xu Fei.

They were in high spirits as Chen Bi had broken through to the God of Creation Realm!

“Oh? You discovered the kid?” Chen Bi smiled when he heard the news.

“Yes! They’re right there! Lords Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan are there too!” The disciples of the Chen Family who made the report explained.

A light flashed in Chen Bi’s eyes. “Lords Zhu Yuan and Zhu Ding are there too? Great!”

“Yes.”

“Zhu Ding? Zhu Yuan?” Ancestor Chen Bi raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Chen Bi explained, ‘The two of them are inner disciples of the Zhu Family. I met them previously and we’re pretty well acquainted. Lord Ancestor, Lord Du, Lord Xu, let's go! I’ll introduce them to you!”

The three of them nodded eventually.

As such, the Chen Family’s group started to make their way over.

It didn’t take long for Ancestor Chen Bi, Du Chengjiang, and Xu Fei to notice the group. As Huang Xiaolong’s party was walking in their direction, they recognized Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Yu Xiaohong instantly.

The faces of the three ancestors changed drastically.

Even though Ancestor Chen Bi was a God of Creation at the small completion stage and was the old ancestor of a small family, he could recognize the heavy weights of the Unknown Lands!

His eyes seemed to pop out of their sockets.

“Yu… Yu… Yu…” Du Chengjiang and Xu Fei felt their souls leaving their bodies.

Chen Bi noticed the flustered expressions of the trio and he couldn’t help but ask, “Lord Ancestors, this…”

He heard a miserable cry in the distance and he couldn’t help but turn to look. He saw the inner disciples of the Zhu Family turn to meat paste with a single slap from Gui Chi! Not even their dao souls managed to escape!
