Chapter 3609 – Rolling Off The Mountain?!

“Lord Zhou Chi?! Ice Mountain?!” Lin Xian jumped in fright.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. “That’s right. I’ll be heading there soon to pay him a visit.”

Lin Xian had a bad premonition rising in his heart. Looking at the way Huang Xiaolong did things, wouldn’t he be going to the Ice Mountain to rob the man clean?! When his thoughts ventured this far, Lin Xian couldn’t help but observe a moment of silence for Zhou Chi.

He didn’t dare to dally since Huang Xiaolong gave the order to investigate. He personally passed down the order to look into the Ice Mountain.

After Huang Xiaolong learned that Zhou Chi hadn’t left the mountain, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. If Zhou Chi was like Lin Qiankun, he would be forced to wait for the man to return.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong left the city as he traveled towards the Ice Mountain.

The Ice Mountain was a mythical mountain in the Limitless Land. The ice qi that surrounded the mountain was extremely powerful, and not even Dao Venerables would be able to venture into the depths of the mountain.

In fact, it was more appropriate to describe it as the Ice Mountain Range as it was made up of multiple peaks.

As one of the ten strongest cultivators in the Limitless Land, Zhou Chi’s presence on the Ice Mountain Range made it a sacred land for cultivators who trained in ice techniques. There were countless experts going over to pay their respects to Zhou Chi, and many of them were Sons of Creation and old ancestors of their races. There were even several celestial emperors who would make a trip over, and there had been instances of half step Universe Gods going over too.

Zhou Chi’s prestige in the Limitless Land was incomparable!

Even a prince of the Limitless Celestial Empire would have to show him some respect.

By the time Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Ice Mountain Range, he saw hoards of experts from the various celestial empires going over to pay their respects to Zhou Chi.

“Brother, are you also here to pay your respects to Lord Zhou?” An expert from the great families asked Huang Xiaolong when he saw the man traveling alone.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the person who approached him, and he realized that it was a Dao Venerable who had comprehended eleven elements to the perfection level. With his strength, his status wouldn’t be low in the Limitless Land.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

The expert became even more enthusiastic when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s reply. “I wonder what present you brought Lord Zhou Chi?”

“Present?”

“Brother, did you really not prepare anything?” The man asked when he noticed the confusion in Huang Xiaolong’s voice. “Everyone who wishes to meet Lord Zhou Chu would have to prepare presents! Moreover, they would need four sets of presents in order to gain an audience with him!”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised. “Four sets?”

“One would be for Lord Zhou Chi, and the three other sets are for his disciples! Everyone who wishes to meet Lord Zhou Chi would have to register with his grand disciples. If you bring along a single set of present, you won’t even be able to step through the entrance of the mountain range!” The man explained.

“There was a Son of Creation who prepared four ordinary sets of presents and he was thrown out by Lord Zhou Chi’s grand disciples!”

There were some experts nearby who sighed, “There are too many people who wish to meet Lord Zhou Chi. Even Gods of Creation at the small competition and large completion stage might not be able to meet him!”

“That sounds right. Lord Zhou Chi is someone who broke through the 10 billion units mark! Why would he meet with ordinary Gods of Creation?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong frowned, “Since you know that you won’t be able to meet Lord Zhou Chi, why would you come all the way here?”

“Many of us who came had a request for Lord Zhou Chi. Even if we can’t see him, getting close to his grand disciples is good enough. As long as they make a move, all your problems will go away.”

“I wonder what you wish to ask of Lord Zhou Chi…” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Hesitating for a moment, the man eventually explained, “I am the old ancestor of the Wang Family in the Standing Darkness Celestial Empire. My family offended a prince of the royal family of the empire, and I wish to ask Lord Zhou Chi to plead on my behalf. Even if his grand disciples do it, the prince wouldn’t dare to do anything to my Wang Family!”

There was an awkward expression when he spoke of his problem.

“Standing Darkness Celestial Empire?” Huang Xiaolong asked. “Isn’t that the celestial empire beside the Yin Yang Celestial Empire?”

“Yes.” The expert nodded slightly. He had no idea why Huang Xiaolong would bring up the Yin Yang Celestial Empire.

“Alright, I know Lin Xian of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. I’ll get him to speak to the members of the Standing Darkness Celestial Empire.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“Lin Xian?! The Yin Yang Celestial Emperor?!” Wang Xin, the man who was speaking to Huang Xiaolong all this time, gasped. “Are you serious?!”

The Yin Yang Celestial Emperor was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. If he spoke on behalf of the Wang Family, there was no way anyone would dare to touch his family. After all, the old ancestor of the Standing Darkness Celestial Empire was only at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.

However…

The Yin Yang Celestial Emperor was like a god! Wang Xin didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong could actually do as he said. After all, everyone knew that above the Yin Yang Celestial Emperor was Lin Qiankun himself, a half step Universe God! That was the most ancient half step Universe God in the Limitless Land they were talking about!

Laughter came from the side before Wang Xin could say anything, and it was directed at Huang Xiaolong. “Brat, do you really expect us to believe you?!” It was a prince from one of the celestial empires. “I know Lord Zhou Chi, but he doesn’t know me!”

Laughter filled the skies.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the person who spoke and sighed, “Are you from the Black Flame Celestial Empire?”

“That’s right. I’m Hei Yu of the Black Flame Celestial Empire.”

The Black Flame Celestial Empire was comparable in strength to the Standing Darkness Celestial Empire, and their founders were at the same level of strength.

Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Alright. I’ll remember that.”

After he spoke, he walked towards the peak of the Ice Mountain Range.

Wang Xin stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. “Brother, you didn’t prepare any gifts! Don’t tell me you brought a message from the Yin Yang Celestial Emperor…”

“Nope.”

“Just go home… Without anything, you won’t be able to step through the gates of the Ice Mountain Range.” Wang Xin sighed. He was warning Huang Xiaolong out of goodwill. After all, there were many people who were sent rolling off the mountain when they turned up without any gifts.

When that happened, their reputations would be dragged through the mud! They would turn into laughing stocks!

When the prince of the Black Flame Celestial Empire noticed what was going on, he laughed loudly, “Things are going to get interesting now… There hasn’t been anyone who dared to enter the Ice Mountain Range without gifts in a long time. What do you think Wei Qi would do to him?”

Wei Qi was Zhou Chi’s oldest disciple. He was in charge of guarding the entrance.

“He’s definitely going to be kicked off the mountain. Hahaha! Lord Wei Qi will kick him so hard he rolls down the mountain!” Someone mocked as laughter filled the air.
