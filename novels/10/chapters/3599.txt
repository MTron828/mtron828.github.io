Chapter 3600 – Prince Ying Wuyou

Huang Xiaolong was in no rush as he enjoyed a stroll through the city on the back of the beast kings.

Three hours later, they arrived in front of Jin Hai’s manor.

As a God of Creation at the large completion stage and the ancestor of a celestial empire, Jin Hai’s manor was located in a pretty good spot. It might not be in the center of the city, but it was close! The manor was in no way lacking to the manor Huang Xiaolong constructed in the Golden Sea City.

A residence in the city would cost an astronomical amount to a creed as it would probably be priced at ten billion dao coins. If they wanted a manor in the heart of the city, it would probably double.

Huang Xiaolong opened the restriction around the manor and strode in.

“Golden Manor!” Two words shone brightly on the entrance of the manor.

Jin Hai personally inscribed the words on the manor, and the prestige of a God of Creation could be felt coming from it.

Huang Xiaoong casually imprinted a blue dragon beside the words before entering the main hall of the manor.

“This place is huge!” Tao Han’er gasped after they toured the manor.

Huang Xiaolong nodded to himself. The manor was comparable to the one he built in the Golden Sea City, and Jin Hai definitely remodeled it after the purchase. He used creation level treasures to strengthen the area.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong casually built his manor in the Golden Sea City as he didn’t plan to stay for long.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t do anything to the manor itself, but he chose to lay his own formations. After an afternoon of work, he completed the formations around the Golden Manor.

Leaving the manor, the three of them left for the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion.

The Bathing Phoenix Pavilion was located in the middle of the city, and it took them less than half an hour to arrive.

As soon as they did, they saw a sea of people seated in the pavilion. The main hall itself was like a mini city, as people streamed in and out of the entrance.

“How can there be so many people?! Are they all here for the Bathing Phoenix? She thought that there wouldn’t be many people due to the sky high price of the dish, but she couldn’t be more wrong.

She frowned, “There might not be any seats for us in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion…” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong nearly broke out in laughter. “There might not be any seats on the first and second floor, but there are definitely some seats for us on the higher floors!”

There were four stories in total, and anyone could enter the first and second stories if they had enough money. As for the third floor, one would only enter if they were a powerhouse in the Limitless Land. Old ancestors and patriarchs of the large families would be able to get a seat there, and only God of Creation Realm experts of those relation to Gods of Creation would be able to enter the fourth floor.

Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the main hall. They noticed that there were ten thousand seats on the first floor, and every one of them was filled. The same could be said for the second level.

When they tried to approach the third level, the experts of the pavilion stopped Huang Xiaolong’s party courteously and asked for their identity plaques.

Getting Tao Hang to show his identity plaque of the Golden Manor, the experts of the pavilion could feel the aura of a God of Creation instantly. Respectful looks appeared on their faces as they invited Huang Xiaolong’s group up to the fourth floor.

The decorations on the third and fourth floor of the pavilion were completely different from that of the main hall. When the experts of the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion brought them up to the fourth floor, they were allowed to choose any seat they fancy. Top-grade tea was served immediately, and they behaved extremely respectfully.

Less than a fifth of the fourth floor was taken up as everyone there had some relationship with God of Creation Realm experts. As a Primal Ancestor and True Saint, Tao Han’er and Tao Hang, stood out immediately. No one knew how they were related to a God of Creation.

Huang Xiaolong was the worst as he looked like an ordinary mortal.

Many people stared at the group as they guessed the identity of the three newcomers.

Ignoring all of them, Huang Xiaolong spoke to the experts of the pavilion, “Send up three Bathing Phoenixes. Get us a table of your signature dishes, and bring us a jar of your best wine each.”

The expert from the pavilion hesitated for a moment. “A jar of our best wine will cost you a hundred million dao coins! It’s extremely expensive, and not even guests who can enjoy a table here will order them…”

“Oh. It doesn’t matter.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The expert of the pavilion quickly left to prepare the order.

On one of the tables in the corner, a young lady was seated elegantly with two old ladies standing respectfully behind her.

The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared, the young lady had been observing him. She spoke to the two old ladies behind her, “The youngster is really interesting. He brings along his slaves in the Primal Ancestor Realm and True Saint Realm for dinner, and he even ordered them a Bathing Phoenix each.”

Experts who were able to get a table in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion definitely had attendants who had comprehended the elements, and they would be Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables at the very least. That was the first time anyone saw a Primal Ancestor and True Saint enjoying dinner on the fourth floor.

One of the old experts sniggered, “What a joke. The youngster really doesn’t care about his reputation.” However, her tone changed suddenly, “Princess Yi, that might be the case, but he’s definitely not someone we can deal with.”

The other old expert nodded, “I used a secret art to look into the youngster’s strength earlier. I’m afraid he’s stronger than we can imagine.”

The young lady gasped softly in response, “Does that mean that the youngster is someone who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level?”

Both experts standing behind her were Dao Venerables who had comprehended the elements to the grand perfection level and closed in on 1.3 billion units of grand cosmos energy. If they weren’t able to see through Huang Xiaolong’s strength, he had to be a supreme expert.

They nodded their heads slowly.

“How do you think he compares to Ying Wuyou?” She asked all of a sudden.

They were taken aback.

“This youngster is definitely far from being able to match up to Prince Ying. However, I sent someone to investigate his identity, and the kid used the plaque of the Golden Manor in order to enter the fourth floor. Jin Hai has a lot of sons, but Jin Chengguang is the only one who has comprehended all thirteen elements to the perfection level. The young man is no Jin Chengguang.”

A look of doubt formed on their faces.

Before anyone could say anything else, commotion broke out in the fourth floor of the pavilion.

“Prince Ying Wuyou has arrived!”

Everyone looked at the entrance of the fourth floor, and a youngster clad in silver robes slowly entered. There was a faint smile on his face, and he exuded a special type of pressure. The moment he arrived, he noticed Princess Yi and he made his way over.
