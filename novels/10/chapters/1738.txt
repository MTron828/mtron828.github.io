“Enemy attack!”

“Someone broke into the headquarters; quickly activate the Nine Yin Grand Array!”

Like a chain reaction, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors were alerted one after another. All of them were immediately enraged that someone had the guts to attack their headquarters.

In a split second, powerful auras soared to the sky from various corners of the Nine Yin Mountain Range as figures whizzed across the air at an alarming speed. All of them were rushing to the square.

Even though Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid of them, the Nine Yin Grand Array was a powerful grand formation that was strengthened many times over several years. Hence, if he were to get trapped within the array, he would fail to break out from the array in a short time.

Time was of the essence when escaping; thus, Huang Xiaolong acted decisively. He circulated the Asura Tactics, and the Gate of Hell appeared above his head.

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong disappeared through the Gate of Hell, leaving the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe headquarters in the blink of an eye.

About three breaths after the Gate of Hell closed, a Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor descended on the square.

As the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors arrived consecutively, the surrounding air currents turned chaotic and turbulent; space became distorted, and cracks emerged.

Moments later, Shi Ming and Shi Wushuang, who were forging the Grandmist artifact within the Nine Yin Space, received reports of the incident from the Ancestors outside.

"What?! Took away a million grains of star sand! And two streams of grandmist aura!" Shi Wushuang’s face ashened reading the report. Even someone as stable as Shi Ming could not maintain his calm composure.

Million-stars sand was nothing to the Nine Ying Giant Corpse Tribe, but the two streams of grandmist aura were Shi Ming and Shi Wushuang’s lives!

Not long ago, both had been mad with joy after finding the two grandmist aura streams. Shi Ming and Shi Wushuang had planned to refine the grandmist aura after successfully forging the grandmist artifact.

"Seven late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Radiance Angels! On top of that, they all have twelve wings!" Gray flames danced in Shi Ming’s pupils. His momentum was akin to an angry volcano on the verge of eruption, and world-destroying power brewed within his body.

"Come, we’re going back!" Shi Ming disappeared from the underground cave in a blur. At this point, forging the grandmist artifact was thrown to the back of his mind. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The land quaked violently with his movement.

Shi Ming flew up several hundred thousand zhang of mountain height and emerged in high air.

Shi Wushuang appeared next to him a moment later.

“Old Ancestor, could it be the Radiance World?” Shi Wushuang spoke first. His eyes gleamed with a sharp and ruthless light.

Shi Ming’s entire body exuded iciness as he spoke, “The Radiance World does not have the guts yet.” There was a trace of doubt on his face as he said the next sentence, “How did Yinyu leave the Nine Yin Space and returned to the headquarters?”

Shi Wushuang also felt suspicious about this and was having difficulty figuring it out. Logically, only the Old Ancestor Shi Ming knew how to open the Gate of Nine Yin.

“The trespasser’s target was clearly the grandmist aura. Only a few people know about the grandmist aura within our treasury.” Shi Ming’s eyes glinted with cold light.

Shi Wushuang’s face was scarily gloomy hearing that. Although only a few knew about the grandmist aura inside the Nine Yin Treasury, somehow, the matter was leaked out! This meant there was a spy amongst the tribe! A spy with high access!

“It seems I’ve underestimated that junior Duwei once again,” blurted Shi Ming.

Shi Wushuang was caught off guard by Shi Ming’s words. He recovered his senses and asked, “Old Ancestor, you mean the attackers are from the Netherworld King’s Organisation?”

Shi Ming explained coldly, “There are no outside experts in the Spirits World, and in the entire Hell, only Duwei has dared to collide with our Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe in such a manner. Moreover, he had appeared in the Spirits World several months ago, so this is no coincidence. Now, it seems he had been plotting something since his arrival in Spirits World."

"Whether it’s really him, we’ll know for certain once we apprehend the spy."

Two beams of light shot out from Shi Ming’s eyes into the void. The Gate of Nine Yin appeared wide open.

Shi Ming and Shi Wushuang passed through the Gate of Nine Yin, appearing high above the headquarters. Without wasting any time, both rushed to the Nine Yin Treasury.

Apart from the two of them, only the four Ancestor guardians knew about the grandmist aura inside the treasury.

In conclusion, the spy was one of the four Ancestor guardians.

And these four people were extremely valued by Shi Ming!

Thick death qi surged violently around Shi Ming. Since the battle with the Ancient Heavenly Court, it had been a long time he had felt such strong killing intent. He had never felt such an intense urge to kill anyone as he did at that moment.

After catching this traitor, he would make sure that the traitor died in the most painful way. He would make every single soul in the world understand the terrible consequences of betraying him, betraying the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe!

Soon, Shi Ming and Shi Wushuang arrived in front of the Nine Yin Treasury’s entrance, however, only three of the Ancestors came to meet them.

, Shi Ming immediately understood what had happened as he saw that one Ancestor guardian was missing from the group.

“Lockdown the entire Nine Yin Plane, and capture the traitor Fan Xiaohong!” Shi Ming was enraged, and violent killing intent surged around him as he added, “Anyone who captures Fan Xiaohong will be rewarded with eight million low-grade chaos spirit stones!”

Shi Ming’s voice reverberated over the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters. Alarming killing intent almost solidified the air, pressing down on everyone on the Nine Yin Plane.

The entire Spirits World was soon in an uproar.

The news about Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s eight million low-grade chaos spirit stones’ reward for capturing the traitor Fan Xiaohong spread out at a startling speed.

"The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor Fan Xiaohong actually belonged to the Netherworld King’s Organisation! He hid within the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe for a billion years until now! They lost a million grains of star sand, two streams of grandmist aura, and even their Young Lord. No wonder their Old Ancestor was close to vomiting blood due to anger!”

Other super forces soon learned about what had happened at the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters.

Some suspected whether Shi Ming would rage war against the Netherworld King’s Organisation in anger!

By this time, Huang Xiaolong had returned to the Divine World through the Gate of Hell, but after some contemplating, he returned to Hell.

He still needed to preside over the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s affairs under the current circumstances.

He summoned Tai Yue and the others back to the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s headquarters on Mohe Plane. Simultaneously, he also issued an order for the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s branches in the Spirits World to move and return to the headquarters on Mohe Plane.

.....

A little over a month later...

Huang Xiaolong was back at the Mohe Plane’s Green Flames Mountain Range. Tai Yue and the rest arrived consecutively.

A while later, the news of the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s headquarters’ location on Mohe Plane spread out like wildfire under Huang Xiaolong’s order.

Before this, the location of the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s headquarters was a mystery. It was time to let people know about it.

Not long after the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s headquarters’ location ‘leaked out,’ the news of Shi Yinyu’s death ensued.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong had killed Shi Yinyu and devoured his godhead.

The Green Flames Mountain Range forbidden land on Mohe Plane had defensive array formations laid out by the previous Lord of Hell. Huang Xiaolong was confident that Shi Ming wouldn’t come attacking Mohe Plane in anger due to this.

After he finished devouring Shi Yinyu’s king of supreme godhead, Huang Xiaolong arrived above a blood pool within the Green Flames Mountain’s forbidden land. The blood pool was light golden-yellow in color and emitted a soft bewitching glow. This was the Demon God Blood Pool.

The first time Huang Xiaolong had entered the forbidden land, he had chosen to receive the Lord of Hell’s inheritance first, because of this he had no time to cultivate inside the Demon God Blood Pool. This time, he planned to refine the two streams of grandmist aura while cultivating inside this Demon God Blood Pool and strive to break through to Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm in one go!

He also wanted to borrow the Demon God Blood Pool’s energy to awaken his own archdevils bloodline’s power!
