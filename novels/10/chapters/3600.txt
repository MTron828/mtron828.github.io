Chapter 3601 – I Wish to Meet Them

Ying Wuyou was the grandson of Ying Ze, a God of Creation! He was also an expert who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level.

God of Creation Ying Ze was a half step Universe God in the Limitless Land. He might not be an ancient existence like Lin Qiankun, but his strength was comparable to the old expert. As Ying Ze’s grandson, Ying Wuyou had an ample amount of resources. With his talent and strength, his reputation in the surrounding celestial empires was large!

Ying Wuyou followed his father, Ying Wan to the Yin Yang City in order to request for Princess Lin Yi’s hand in marriage.

Even though Princess Yi was an expert who had only comprehended twelve elements to the perfection level, her talent was no joke. Her great looks attracted a lot of suitors, and the Sons of Creation of the various celestial empires wished to obtain her hand in marriage.

Ying Wuyou smoked when he arrived before her. “Little Sister Yi, you’re here!”

Lin Yi got to her feet and she nodded slightly, “Big Brother Wuyou…”

The experts behind her called out respectfully, “We greet Prince Ying Wuyou!”

He nodded and sat down beside Lin Yi. He got the experts of the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion to send up three bathing phoenixes before speaking to Lin Yi. “My father tried the dishes here in the past, and he has been craving them ever since. I’ll bring two of them back for him, and I hope Little Sister Yi won’t find it weird.”

Lin Yi smiled, “Of course not. Big Brother Wuyou is such a filial son…”

They started chatting with each other casually after Ying Wuyou placed his order. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In fact, Lin Yi knew the reason behind Ying Wuyou’s appearance in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. She didn’t hate the man, but she didn’t like him either.

Of course, their families would benefit if they were connected by marriage, and she was merely a pawn in the grand scheme of things.

Despite that, Lin Yi’s eyes would unconsciously drift over to Huang Xiaolong’s table as they spoke, and Ying Wuyou’s attention was quickly drawn over.

When he noticed that Tao Hang was a Primal Ancestor and Tao Han’ER was a True Saint, he was shocked.

“Do you know them?” He asked.

Lin Yi shook her head and muttered, “Nope. But he looks pretty interesting. He brought a Primal Ancestor and True Saint over to the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion for a meal.”

One of the old ladies behind her continued, “The youngster came up here using the plaque of the Golden Manor.”

“Oh.” Ying Wuyou heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. “So he’s from the Golden Manor…”

He knew that Jin Hai was a God of Creation at the large completion stage, but that was nothing in his eyes. His grandfather, Ying Ze, was a half step Universe God, and his father was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. No matter who it was, they were people who could crush Jin Hai with a single finger.

When he learned that Huang Xiaolong came from the Golden Manor, he chuckled, “He’s definitely trying to draw attention to himself. What a joke.”

One of the old experts behind Lin Yi laughed, “Prince Ying, you’re right!”

“He’s pretty interesting…” Lin Yi giggled. “He doesn’t care about what others think, and that’s pretty hard to come by!”

A frown formed on Ying Wuyou’s face when he heard her tone. Jealousy filled his heart.

He looked at Huang Xiaolong once again, and the gaze in his eyes became even more unfriendly when he saw his casual appearance.

As thoughts flashed through his mind, the experts of the pavilion brought him his food.

“Go there and call that man over.” Ying Wuyou pointed at Huang Xiaolong and commanded. “Tell him to bring his slaves over, and say that I wish to meet them.”

His words were harsh, and it was as though he gave them an imperial decree.

The expert of the pavilion hesitated for a second, but he chose to follow whatever Ying Wuyou said. He strode over to Huang Xiaolong’s table with his hands trembling slightly. The Bathing Phoenix Pavilion might be backed by a God of Creation, but he was only at the large completion stage! He was far from comparable to Ying Ze!

Lin Yi frowned when she heard the way Ying Wuyou spoke. “Brother Wuyou, why do you wish to meet the young man? This is the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, and if anything happens, your father might be displeased with your actions.”

“From what I’ve heard, he’s not easy to deal with.”

Flames of jealousy burned in Ying Wuyou’s heart when he heard what she said. However, he maintained the smile on his face. “There’s no need to worry. I only wish to talk to him. I won’t do anything else.”

Lin Yi opened her mouth slightly, but she chose to swallow her words.

The expert from the pavilion eventually arrived at Huang Xiaolong’s table and he bowed slightly. “Young master, Prince Ying Wuyou wishes to meet you. He hopes you can bring your subordinates over too.” His tone was polite as he knew that he couldn’t offend someone from the Golden Manor.

The experts sitting on the fourth floor turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Ignoring the man completely, Huang Xiaolong took a swig of wine. “Who the hell is that. Does he know me? Go and tell him that I’m trying to enjoy my meal here. If he dares to affect my appetite, he’ll die a sorry death.”

Huang Xiaolong might be soft, but his words rang in the minds of those sitting around. Of course, Ying Wuyou was no exception.

They stared at him in a daze. Lin Yi felt her head spinning, and so did the two experts standing behind her.

A weird light flashed in her eyes when she looked at Huang Xiaolong. Didn’t he know who Ying Wuyou was? Not even Jin Hai would dare to say what Huang Xiaolong just said!

“Brat, are you crazy?”

“Not even Jin Hai would be able to save him this time… Heh, he might even drag the Golden Sea Celestial Empire into the depths of hell!”

Everyone broke out into discussion.

When Huang Xiaolong used the plaque of the Golden Manor to enter the fourth floor, many people learned of his connection to Jin Hai.

With a chilly light flashing through his eyes, Ying Wuyou roared, “Brat, you better crawl over here right now to apologize! I’ll spare your life on behalf of Jin Hai, but if you refuse, you won’t be leaving this place today!”

Killing intent rageed in his heart when Huang Xiaolong disrespected him in front of Lin Yi and the various experts sitting in the hall.

Everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong, curious about his choice.

A frown formed on Lin Yi’s face. She felt that the youngster was too rash.

Slowly placing his cup down, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Didn’t I tell you not to affect my meal? Too bad you’re retarded.” Huang Xiaolong casually shook his arm and the wine in his cup turned into ten streaks of silver light that shot towards Ying Wuyou.

The light entered his body in an instant.

With his body freezing up, a look of disbelief could be seen on Ying Wuyou’s face. When the silver light faded, he could feel his life force disappearing along with them.
