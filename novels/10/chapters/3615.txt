Chapter 3616 – Qi Wufeng’s Bow

Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, Wu Qifeng left Ye Jingyu’s side and he made his way over to Huang Xiaolong’s group.

“What’s wrong with the crown prince?!”

“Who in the world are they?! Does His Highness recognize them?”

Several old ancestors of great families in the Limitless City exclaimed.

“Your… Your Highness!” Several experts called out to him.

However, he ignored them all and he flew directly to Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua.

“Qifeng greets Senior Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua!” He bowed respectfully after speaking.

Those standing around felt the world spinning around them.

Senior?!

Who in the world was Wu Qifeng?! He was the crown prince of the Limitless Celestial Empire and he was a God of Creation who might be at the grand completion stage! The number of people who could get him to bow could be counted on one hand, but three of them appeared at once!

Ye Jingyu and the experts of the Sleepless Sea were equally as shocked.

“Zhou Chi?! Lin Qiankun?! Rong Hua?!” Ye Jingyu gasped.

Lin Qiankun and Rong Hua didn’t dare to act all high and mighty when they saw Wu Qifeng bowing to them. A smile appeared on their face and they nodded slightly, “Your Highness.”

Zhou Chi was the only one who nodded slightly without saying a word. After all, not even the Limitless Celestial Emperor would put on airs around him. As such, there was no need for him to fawn over Wu Qifeng.

With his gaze turning slowly towards Huang Xiaolong, he asked, “This is…”

Everyone could see how respectful the three of them were behaving towards him.

However, the three of them refused to say a word.

Wu Qifeng felt his heart palpitating when he thought of a shocking possibility.

“You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master.”

Forcing a smile, Wu Qifeng stuttered, “So it’s Lord Blue Dragon…” He turned to the three of them and explained, “If my father knew that seniors have come, he’ll be more than happy to play host to you. Please allow me to invite you over to the palace.”

“There’s no need.” Huang Xiaolong interrupted him, “We have something to deal with now that we’re here. We won’t be going to your palace.”

Wu Qifeng’s expression turned unnatural when he was stopped by Huang Xiaolong. After a slight hesitation, he turned to the three of them and smiled, “Since that’s the case, I won’t bother seniors. I shall take my leave.” Bowing respectfully, he turned to leave.

He quickly returned to the gates before apologizing to Ye Jingyu. After he was done, they entered the city.

When they disappeared into the city, those standing around started to talk about Zhou Chi and the others.

“Senior Zhou Chi?! Could he be the Zhou Chi from the Ice Mountain?”

“If His Highness acts so respectfully, he has to be the one!”

“Lord Zhou Chi hasn’t left the mountain for a long time. Now that he’s here, there might be something important going on!”

Many people started to become excited when they guessed Zhou Chi’s identity. After all, many celestial emperors wouldn’t be able to meet the expert ordinarily!

They didn’t dare to approach Zhou Chi, but that didn’t stop them from getting to their knees. They kowtowed respectfully towards the three.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

He didn’t choose to hide his identity as he no longer had anything to be afraid of.

As such, the four of them entered the city.

Only after a long time after Huang Xiaolong’s group had left did those on their knees dare to get to their feet.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t look for Chen Huanzhi the moment he entered the city. Instead, he went to Zhou Chi’s manor in the city. Existences at their level would definitely own several residences in the Limitless Land. Since the Limitless City was the core of the Limitless Celestial Empire, it went without saying that they all had manors in the city. Zhou Chi’s Ice Manor was on another level compared to the other two and the materials used in his manor were of the universe grade. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After walking around, Huang Xiaolong chuckled happily, “Your Ice Manor is one of the nicest places I’ve seen.”

Zhou Chi laughed and continued, “I’m glad that’s the case. When I bought this residence in the past, I planned out the entire structure. However, I cooped myself up in the Ice Mountain all these years and it’s been abandoned ever since.”

“It’s really nice.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “I’ll head out alone tonight to experience the city life, and you won't have to follow me around.”

There was a night market in the Limitless City and it was also the busiest trade market around. There would be countless treasures exchanged every day, and there might also be universe-level spiritual veins.

Huang Xiaolong’s goal of the trip was the night market there.

“Yes, Lord.” The three of them agreed immediately.

“I’ll need your help to get me an admission pass for the night market.” Huang Xiaolong continued.

With how special the items traded were, not everyone could enter the night market. Only those who had a special plaque would be granted entry.

Naturally, the three of them were more than capable of obtaining a single admission pass.

When the three of them went out to look for a pass, Wu Qifeng reported everything that happened to his father, the Limitless Celestial Emperor, Wu Tianyu.

He mentioned about how he met Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua at the gates while bringing up Huang Xiaolong’s presence.

Wu Tianyu frowned. “Blue Dragon Young Master?”

He thought as hard as he could, but he failed to think of anyone who went by that title.

“Where is he now?” Wu Tianyu asked.

“He’s in Lord Zhou Chi’s Ice Manor.” Wu Qifeng replied. “Father, should we investigate him? Perhaps Emperor Father can summon Lin Qiankun and Rong Hua to ask them about his identity…”

Wu Tianyu shook his head and sighed, “It’s useless to ask the two of them now that they arrived together. Let’s do our own investigation. Look into the Blue Dragon Young Master right now! I want to know everything about him!”

“Yes, Emperor Father!” Wu Qifeng replied. However, he hesitated for a moment before asking, “Should we… Should we report this to the ancestor?”

Wu Tianyu thought about it for a second and he eventually decided against it. “Let’s not alert the ancestor. He was injured by the Dragon Overlord previously and he’s still in the process of healing his wounds. We’ll inform him when he emerges from seclusion.

The night fell soon after.

Huang Xiaolong held the plaque in his hand as he approached the night market.

Even though it was the largest trading platform in the Limitless Land, the night market only operated when the sun was down!
