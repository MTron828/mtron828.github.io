Shortly, Huang Xiaolong descended some distance away from the Divine Dan City’s gates, landing on the main path, blending into the large stream of people heading forward into the city.

A while later, he reached the gates, paid ten high saint grade pills and stepped into the city.

In general, the payment to enter any super forces’ cities was either made with money or spirit stones, only the Divine Dan City set the rule of using medicinal pellets as currency.

Once inside the Divine Dan City, Huang Xiaolong first inquired about the whereabouts of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s headquarters and headed there directly. Although there were roughly two months left until the Grand Competition, he still needed to acquire the official rank of an Alchemist beforehand.

After taking the Alchemist assessment, he could register for the Union’s Grandmaster Competition on the spot and leave to search for a place to stay.

However, he couldn’t help complaining a little, there were really too many people. Even a fly would find it hard to maneuver through the crowd.

Huang Xiaolong was moving forward step by step, covering a pitiful distance of the street after half an hour of walking. By this point, his brows were already scrunched up, feeling vexed.

At this rate, even if he were given half a month he still wouldn’t be able to make it to the Alchemist Grandmaster Union headquarters.

Huang Xiaolong tilted his head upwards, looking at the carriages that occasionally flew past in the air belonging to one family or another. It seemed like he should go and get one himself for convenience’s sake.

The Divine Dan City had a rule that forbid any families or sect’s carriages to enter or fly over the city. Moreover, individuals weren’t allowed to fly as they liked within the city area either, nor could they use Greater Space Teleportation, with one exception. In order to fly freely inside the city, one could do so with the luxury carriages provided by the Alchemist Grandmaster Union.

Naturally, their rental fees were exorbitant. Then again, Huang Xiaolong didn’t lack money.

He asked around for the Alchemist Grandmaster Union Chamber of Commerce and headed there.

The Chamber of Commerce had more than a hundred branches within the Divine Dan City itself. Saying that each street had a branch of it was no exaggeration, hence, Huang Xiaolong was able to find the closest branch in a short time.

After taking a step into the Chamber of Commerce’s Branch building, Huang Xiaolong was bedazzled by the arrays of luxury carriages displayed inside.

There were no less than ten thousand carriages displayed inside!

These carriages were exquisite, grand, majestic, and of course, extravagant. With one look Huang Xiaolong could tell that the carriages were made from top quality spiritual wood and spirit stones,with profound flying formations inscribed on the wheels. Moreover, pulling these carriages were not the common flying horses, but rare and top breed spiritual beasts.

Because there was already quite a number of family disciples inside picking their carriages before Huang Xiaolong entered, he was left unattended, but this didn’t bother him. He walked without the slightest hint of impatience, looking at the different carriage types. At last, Hung Xiaolong stopped in front of a luxurious carriage made from Phantasm Color Crystal.

This Phantasm Color Crystal carriage was pulled by a peak late-Tenth Order God Realm blue Luan Phoenix. The flying formation inscribed on the wheels of this carriage was one of the higher grades.

Huang Xiaolong called over a chamber employee, then pointed at the Phantasm Color Crystal carriage without even asking for the price, stating that he would rent it.

However, the employee revealed a difficult expression as he explained to Huang Xiaolong, “This Young Master, I am truly sorry, but this Luan Phoenix Phantasm Color Crystal carriage is Young Master Jiang Lei’s long term rental carriage. We do not rent it out.”

“Young Master Jiang Lei?” Clearly, Huang Xiaolong had no idea who this person referred to.

The employee elaborated patiently due to Huang Xiaolong’s extraordinary bearing, “Young Master Jiang Lei is our Union’s Eminent Elder Jiang Bi’s personal disciple. Every time he comes over, he only takes this Luan Phoenix Phantasm Color Crystal carriage, therefore, our Chamber of Commerce President had already instructed that this carriage cannot be rented out.”

The Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s Chamber of Commerce was also managed internally by the Union’s own members. Not to mention the fact that their Chamber of Commerce President was merely an Elder, if an Eminent Elder’s personal disciple wanted to use this carriage, he naturally dared not rent it to others.

Right at this time, a young man in fine brocade robes walked in with his arms over two luscious women.

Seeing that young man, the chamber employee who was talking to Huang Xiaolong hurried over to greet him, “Young Master Jiang Lei, your excellent self is here.”

That brocade robed young man was literally walking with his nose pointed to the sky, giving a crude snort as an answer to the employee.

Jiang Lei reached the Luan Phoenix Phantasm Color Crystal carriage, giving Huang Xiaolong a glance over, breaking into a satirical snicker, “What, brat, you want to rent this carriage? Do you know how much it costs? Let me tell you, renting this carriage costs one hundred high divine grade spirit pellets, do you even have them?”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows pulled into a faint frown.

Next, Jiang Lei burst into laughter, “Even if you do have a hundred high divine grade spirit pellets, you still can’t afford to sit your ass on it, only someone with my status and identity could sit in this carriage. But if you can take out those spirit pellets, I’ll be generous enough to consider letting you touch the carriage.”

This Phantasm Color Crystal carriage was his private surrey. Hence, when Jiang Lei saw Huang Xiaolong fantasizing about renting his private carriage he was extremely unhappy and vented his irritation with sarcasm. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jiang Lei let out a wanton laugh after saying that.

The two women in his arms were giggling so hard their milky white breasts were jiggling out of control.

The employee risked a furtive glance at the two young women, swallowing his saliva hard, ‘His mother, these two wenches are really high-grade rumpus ah.’

Huang Xiaolong was as indifferent as ever, looking at Jiang Lei, “Is that so? You will regret your words today very soon.”

Jiang Lei was stunned, but quickly recovered. He started laughing even louder, even more unbridled as he said to the two women in his arms, “Did you two hear him? There’s actually someone who dared to threaten me, Jiang Lei, threaten me, Eldest Young Master Jiang!”

The two women giggled even harder.

“Young Master Jiang, that brat doesn’t know how powerful you are, he’s stupid and naive. Otherwise, if given ten thousand leopard guts, he wouldn’t dare to threaten you.” One of the women said, trying to flatter Jiang Lei.

Jiang Lei ceased laughing, his piercing gaze directed at Huang Xiaolong, “Brat, you’re here to participate in the Alchemist Grandmaster Union Grand Competition, am I right? Do you know the consequences of offending me?”

Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders, “I’m really curious.”

Jiang Lei sneered, “You will know very soon.” He looked over his shoulder at the chamber employee with a smile on his face, “This brat is displeasing to my eyes, get someone to throw him out.”

The man was stupefied, then hesitated at Jiang Lei’s request.

Jiang Lei’s eyes narrowed maliciously, “Do I need to do it myself?”

Just as that employee was about to say something to persuade Huang Xiaolong, an authoritative voice interrupted, “What is happening here?”

Everyone turned over to look, seeing an old man clad in an Alchemist Grandmaster Union Elder robe walking towards them together with several young men with imposing bearing.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly dazed for a second: Wangu Yanhui!

The several young men with the Elder were all Wangu Clan disciples, and one of them was none other than Wangu Yanhui.

“President, you’re here.” That employee quickly scurried over to the old man in Elder robe. After a respectful greeting, he summarized the situation, “This young master wanted to rent the Luan Phoenix Phantasm Color Crystal carriage, conflicting with Young Master Jiang Lei.” He pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

This old man was the Alchemist Grandmaster Union Chamber of Commerce’s President, Lin Xin.

Lin Xin looked at Huang Xiaolong, but before he could say anything, someone else spoke first.

“Brother Huang, we meet again.” Wangu Yanhui stepped forward, greeting Huang Xiaolong with a bright smile on his face, “You’re also here to participate in the Alchemist Grandmaster Grand Competition, right?”

Lin Xin was just about to reprimand Huang Xiaolong, but it never crossed his mind that Wangu Yanhui would know this brat, and judging from his demeanor, there was also caution and awe?

Lin Xin was greatly shocked, who was this black-haired young man? He knew very well Wangu Yanhui’s status and identity, someone even he needed to be courteous to.
