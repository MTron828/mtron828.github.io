Chapter 3440: Discovering a Natural World

 

As he devoured the five of them, Huang Xiaolong continued to train in the Pangu World Creation Art. The grand cosmos energy accumulated by the five became his gains.

His seclusion lasted for more than fifty thousand years.

When he finally opened his eyes, he had long since converted all the grand cosmos energy. He also managed to refine both universe-level spiritual veins along with the bottles of pills.

The grand cosmos energy accumulated in his third world reached a staggering 230 million units.

The grand cosmos energy he obtained from the five experts of the True Dragon Celestial Empire didn’t even make up a tenth of what he had now.

Luckily for him, he had the four Origin Divine Fires! He was able to devour all five of them quickly despite him not being in the God of Creation Realm.

Ensuring that there was no problem with his cultivation, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. A feeling of joy formed in his heart.

He might not have reached the peak of his third great world, but his speed of cultivation was several times greater than when he refined the World of Departed Souls.

“It’s a pity… Only Huang Jia had accumulated more than 1.2 billion units.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

If all five of them were at his level, Huang Xiaolong might be able to be twice as strong as he was!

He eventually left the star he cultivated on.

When he left, he started to roam about the universe. He looked for clues on creation-level herbs and universe-level spiritual veins, and he also got someone to look for the whereabouts of experts from the True Dragon Celestial Empire.

In the next hundreds of thousands of years that followed, there were experts of the True Dragon Celestial Empire disappearing left and right.

Huang Dinghai was jumping in rage, but he failed to find the culprit no matter how hard he tried.

“Old Ancestor, we lost contact with Huang Yu yesterday.” Huang Dinghai kneeled before Huang Sheng in one of the random spaces in the empire as beads of cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

He was the seventh victim since Huang Xiaolong’s killing spree started!

The True Dragon Celestial Empire lost seven experts with more than 1 hundred million units of grand cosmos energy in the past hundreds of thousands of years.

If that kept up, it would be a matter of time before all the noteworthy experts in the empire disappeared!

When that happened, the True Dragon Celestial Empire would be an empire no more! 

The true experts the celestial empires had under their banner were those who had accumulated more than a hundred million units of grand cosmos energy. Without them, Huang Dinghai would be a commander with no soldiers!

Huang Sheng glared at Huang Dinghai for a solid minute. The celestial emperor fell to his knees in fright. Under the gaze of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage like Huang Sheng, Huang Dinghai didn’t dare to breathe loudly.

“You’re useless!” Huang Sheng growled.

“Yes… Yes… I’m useless!” Huang Dinghai added.

“You can’t even find out what happened in the World of Departed Souls after so many years! There’s the matter of the Dao Emperor Palace too! Now, the experts of our empire are killed by a mysterious killer, and you can’t even find out the man’s identity!” Huang Sheng roared, “If not for the fact that you made great contributions to the empire, I would cripple you right here and now!”

Huang Dinghai prostrated on the ground, and he didn’t dare to quibble.

He might be able to save himself if he kept quiet, but if he tried to quarrel with the old ancestor, he was bound to be a cripple.

“What about Huang Xiaolong’s whereabouts?! Have you found him yet?” Huang Sheng asked.

Panicking, Huang Dinghai stuttered, “Not… Not yet… Ever since he killed our men in the Pangu World, he hasn’t shown himself.”

“Go look for him! Look for him right now! Report his whereabouts to me once you discover any traces of him!” Huang Sheng growled. “Even if he appears in the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire, you have to let me know!”

He felt that something was off about Huang Xiaolong. His intuition told him that everything that happened had something to do with the kid, but he refused to believe that a mere Huang Xiaolong had the ability to raise waves in the True Dragon Celestial Empire.

As such, he would personally move against Huang Xiaolong the moment he appeared.

Regardless of the price he had to pay, he knew that he had to kill Huang Xiaolong.

Even if he had to fight with the old dragon, he would sacrifice everything to kill the threat that was growing larger by the day!

After Huang Dinghai left, Huang Sheng appeared beside Huang Long.

The corners of Huang Long’s mouth arched upwards. “Who would have thought that the strongest individual in the universe would be flustered.”

“Huang Long, you won’t be here for long. Let me tell you right now. I plan on creating a world of my own! In my world, I will devour you! I might have needed a billion years to devour you previously, but once we’re in my world, I will only need five hundred million years!”

“As for your son, he won’t be living for much longer. Once I surpass the God of Creation Realm, he won’t be able to hide no matter how large the universe is!” Huang Sheng snorted.

Huang Long’s face changed.

He didn’t expect Huang Sheng to establish a world of his own.

If that were the case, the time Huang Sheng needed to surpass the God of Creation Realm would be cut in half!

Once that happened, it was true that Huang Xiaolong would have no place to hide.

At that moment, Huang Xiaolong was staring at a youngster in one of the random worlds in the universe. The other party was an expert with three hundred million units of grand cosmos energy called Huang Yu.

“Huang Xiaolong, it’s you!” Huang Yu glared at Huang Xiaolong and roared in panic, “Huang Xiaolong, you won’t get away with this!” 

Too lazy to talk to him, Huang Xiaolong sealed off Huang Yu’s energy before devouring him.

Several tens of thousands of years later…Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Huang Xiaolong left the small world in the universe and soared through the universe.

In the years that followed, the experts of the True Dragon Celestial Empire hid in the Blazing Dragon World. Huang Xiaolong didn’t find any chances to make a move on them.

When Huang Xiaolong was planning on sneaking into the True Dragon Celestial Empire to grab some experts, a piece of good news came from the old dragon.

“Discovered a natural large world like the World of Departed Souls?!” That was great news indeed.

After he devoured the essence energy of the world that was discovered, Huang Xiaolong’s third world had hopes of surpassing the 1.2 billion grand cosmos energy mark.

He would be able to break into the God of Creation Realm.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong appeared before the old dragon.

Giving Huang Xiaolong all the details he knew, the old dragon sighed, “Huang Sheng has been keeping a close eye on me. I won’t be able to head over with you, and you need to take care of yourself! The newly discovered world is located at the heart of the Universe Vortex, and it’s a dangerous place!” The old dragon reminded him.
