At that moment, the little cow spun her head around and spoke to Jiang Hong, “Kiddo Grandmist, I trust that you’ll be able to help Kiddo Huang to deal with the chaos demonic beast, right? Huang Xiaolong is still quite weak... He needs several more Emperor Realm bodyguards by his side.”

Beads of cold sweat formed on Jiang Hong’s forehead. Several more Emperor Realm bodyguards?! I’m afraid only Senior Azure Cow can say something like this... Even the son of the celestial emperor wouldn’t be able to bring out so many Emperor Realm masters!

“I’ll give it a shot, it shouldn’t be a problem,” replied Jiang Hong. If this was before Jiang Hong had broken through to the eighth level of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, he wouldn’t have been as confident as he was. However, that was in the past. The current Jiang Hong was more than confident in his ability to keep Huang Xiaolong safe.

Of course, Jiang Hong knew that there was always a possibility of failure.

That was why he decided not to be too full of himself.

“That’s great!” The little cow nodded her head and giggled, “Kiddo Huang, even though you have another Emperor Realm bodyguard by your side, you can’t kick me aside...”

“Even if I kick myself away, I won’t kick you aside...” Huang Xiaolong laughed bitterly.

“That’s more like it! No wonder I developed some feelings for you!”

Developed feelings for him?!

The faces of Xiang Xun and the others regained their usual vigour.

Even Jiang Hong couldn’t help but smile.

Although Huang Xiaolong knew that the little cow was joking around with him, he couldn’t help but feel nervous. He replied with a slight tremble in his voice, “You’re asking for it!”

They laughed and chatted as they journeyed onto the peak of the mountain.

Previously, Huang Xiaolong, Xu Baisheng, and the others weren’t able to detect the nefarious qi that emanated from the chaos demonic beast. Now that they arrived on the peak of the mountain, the nefarious qi blasted against them with full-force.

The constant bombardment of nefarious qi made it hard for them to breathe normally.

“The chaos demonic beast seems to be as strong as me....” Xiang Xun said in a solemn voice.

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback by Xiang Xun’s statement. He knew that Xiang Xun was a peak-First Order Emperor Realm master. With the might of his fleshy body, regular experts at the peak of the Second Order Emperor Realm weren’t his match. That meant that the power possessed by thechaos demonic beast was more than comparable to the power of a peak early-Second Order Emperor!

As a chaos demonic beast, it would be able to hold its own against human experts at the peak of the mid-Second Order Emperor Realm with its peak early-Second Order Emperor Realm cultivation!

The chaos demonic beast was the same as Xiang Xun! It had the battle prowess of a peak mid-Second Order Emperor!

The little cow’s lips curled upwards. “The stronger the beast, the better! I love strong beasts!”

Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong laughed along with her.

“Junior brother, can you sense the location of the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and started to channel his godforce into theBlood Eye Devil Stele.

Despite his efforts, the stele remained silent. The eye on the Blood Eye Devil Stele remained tightly shut.

Huang Xiaolong furrowed his brows and thought to himself, what’s going on? The last time I checked, the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele was located on the peak of this mountain!

“Is someone using some chaos divine art to hide the location of the stele?” Jiang Hong said as he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s increasingly flustered expression.

“Do you mean... Do you mean that the chaos demonic beast has the ability to do that?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Jiang Hong nodded his head in agreement, “That’s right, only this beast has the ability to do such a thing. Being able to seal the eye of the Blood Eye Devil Stele is no easy feat! Without the strength of an Emperor, one can forget about doing so. Moreover, the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range is the breeding grounds of the Blood Demons. Isn’t it strange for a chaos demonic beast to appear here?”

“Well? What else are we waiting for? Let’s go hunt down that chaos demonic beast!” The little cow cried out.

“The chaos demonic beast is right under this mountain. However, it has already set up many ancient restrictions and I’m going to deal with those before we hunt him down.” As soon as the words left his mouth, Jiang Hong’s finger danced about in the air as he pointed at the foot of the mountain. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Initially, there appeared to be no effect whatsoever, however, after a few moments, the ground beneath them quaked violently and a ear splitting boom resounded.

Despite there being no movement of energy, the ground rumbled everytime Jiang Hong pointed at a space in the air.

After some time, the earth regained its former calm.

The ancient demonic restrictions were strong, and if an ordinary Fourth Order Emperor were to try his best, he would take at least several days to break them. It was too bad the restrictions barely managed to hold out against several taps of Jiang Hong’s finger.

“Nice! Let’s head down now!”

Breaking through the void, Huang Xiaolong and the rest charged towards the foot of the mountain.

When they continued to descend after arriving at the foot of the mountain, the scene that greeted them was vastly different from when they were standing on the peak. A wave of nefarious qi greeted them and they found themselves surrounded by darkness.

The nefarious qi seemed to ripple endlessly from within the cavern and its corrosive effect became much stronger. Even an expert at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch realm were to step foot in this place, he would lose his life if he was a little careless.

Luckily, Huang Xiaolong and the others had Xiang Xun and Jiang Hong to protect them. With the godforce of the two experts revolving around them, the nefarious qi became as harmless as water vapor.

Huang Xiaolong glanced around and could only see an endless sea of pitch black darkness around him. The only things that disrupted the sea of black, were sharp stalagmites and stalactites with varying heights, that seemed to appear out of nowhere. Some of them were merely several feet tall. However, there were some that were thousands of feet tall.

The second they entered the dark space, brilliant rays of black light emerged from the Blood Eye Devil Stele. It emitted a loud hum and the eye buzzed non-stop, as if it was meeting its long lost friend.

It’s here!

The second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele was located in the space created by the chaos demonic beast!

The chaos demonic beast had probably carved out the dark void around the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele... It was probably trying to keep it for itself.

A deafening buzz resounded through the void as the Blood Eye Devil Stele in Huang Xiaolong’s hand shook violently.

A sneer appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face in the next instant. “That chaos demonic beast is trying to refine the other half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele!”

Although a Hell’s blood line and a darkness element godhead was needed to refine the Blood Eye Devil Stele, they never knew if the chaos demonic beast had another way to refine the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele. Even though Huang Xiaolong had already refined the first half and in theory, no one should be able to refine the second half, they couldn’t be a hundred percent sure.

If it really managed to refine the second half, things would become really troublesome for Huang Xiaolong.

“Let’s go!” Huang Xiaolong cried out as he hopped onto the little cow and sped off in the direction of the other part of the stele. Everyone snapped to their senses and followed closely behind.

Before long, they noticed the presence of devil qi. Even though it appeared intermittently, everyone could feel that it was the same devil qi that the first half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele emitted. There was only one explanation. The second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele was right in front of them!

It was too bad that there was the presence of nefarious qi in the air. It was extremely strong and it was trying its hardest to suppress the devil qi emitted by the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele.

All of them didn’t waste any more time as they increased their speed.

In a few minutes, they arrived at the source of the qi.

The sight that greeted them was horrifying. The Blood Eye Devil Stele hovered in mid air and a camel-like beast towered over it. Nefarious qi rolled off its body in waves and it opened its mouth to spit out a type of brilliant black light. As the light enveloped the stele, it tried to suppress the light emerging from the eye.

Sensing that it had company, the beast turned its body and stared at them.
