Other experts were smiling and cheering as they watched the sea beasts retreat, feeling as if a burden was taken off their chest.

“Huang Xiaolong, the matter of you wantonly killing my Elephant Genesis Sect’s Elder Li Qingyang will not end just like this.” Great Grand Elder Hu Qing warned Huang Xiaolong with a hateful glare before turning to order Yang Yun, “We’re leaving!” He then leaped into the air and left just like that.

Yang Yun hurried to catch up.

Huang Xiaolong snorted audibly, making no move to stop them.

South Huai City’s perilous situation hadn’t really been lifted, leaving those two alive for the time being could provide some fighting power to the city.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong and Yao Chi were led to the Barbarian God Sect by Elder Guo Xuan. Due to the emergency situation, all three sects had temporarily shifted their branch command to a residence closer to the city walls.

Stepping into the main hall, Huang Xiaolong and Yao Chi took the main seats while Guo Xuan sat down in the seat lower to Huang Xiaolong’s.

After the three of them were seated, Huang Xiaolong asked Guo Xuan about the latest situation of South Huai City and the Green Cloud Island overall.

Only now did Huang Xiaolong come to know that the sea beasts and sea tribes’ assault this time was much more severe compared to the past. Among several hundred cities on Green Cloud Island, more than a dozen of them had been annexed by the sea beasts.

What truly shocked Huang Xiaolong was that, this time, the sea beasts and sea tribes not only launched a large scale assault on Green Cloud Island but also Dralion Island, Perennial Temple Island, Qunxiong Island, and ten other islands in the archipelago. The common point of these islands was that they were all occupied by humans.

The situations of these islands were more or less similar, thus they wouldn’t be able to send any reinforcements to Green Cloud Island.

Everything would depend on Green Cloud Island’s own available sects and forces.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered, what was the reason for the sea beasts and sea tribes to launch such a large scale attack on human occupied islands? Did a conflict arise between the sea creatures of the Endless Sea and other sea territories?

The subsequent few days were calm. Ever since the sea beast tide retreated that day, there were no further attacks on the city.

However, Huang Xiaolong did not relax his vigilance, instead, he had the Barbarian God Sect disciples increased their patrol frequency.

At different times during the day, Huang Xiaolong and Yao Chi would make rounds around the city on the little cow and Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast, whereas at night, both focused on raising their strength.

As the result of absorbing godforce from the Ancient God Realm godhead in recent days, Huang Xiaolong’s strength rose significantly. So much that he was much closer to breaking through to mid-Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm. Huang Xiaolong had a hunch that, within a month, he would be able to step into mid-Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm.

As for the Elephant Genesis Sect’s Hu Qing and Yang Yun, they were also quiet during this time as if they were afraid of Huang Xiaolong’s strength and dared not recklessly make any moves.

A couple more days passed in the same manner.

Huang Xiaolong and Yao Chi were patrolling around the city when all of a sudden Huang Xiaolong felt somehow stifled like there was a great mountain pressing down on his chest.

In the next second, he felt the earth quake beneath his feet. It wasn’t obvious at first, but the tremors soon intensified. Within seconds, the cracks on the streets had reached the buildings, causing walls to crumble and buildings to collapse.

In less than a minute, it seemed like the entire South Huai City was shaking violently.

Out of nowhere, a long resounding cry echoed throughout the whole city.

Both Huang Xiaolong and Yao Chi revealed grim expressions hearing this sound. This was the three sects’ agreed signal when the sea beast tide was attacking, alerting all the experts inside South Huai City the sea beasts were attacking the city.

“Let’s go!”Huang Xiaolong and Yao Chi did not hesitate at all as they sped towards the city entrance on the little cow and the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast.

They were patrolling close to the city walls, hence it didn’t take Huang Xiaolong and Yao Chi to reach the top of the city walls.

However, when they got a view of what was coming at them, even a strong-willed person like Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help looking slightly pale.

On the shores in the distance, more sea beasts than the eye could see were rapidly crossing the land toward South Huai City.

Not only from the shore, even the air was densely dotted with sea beasts that could fly, having giant wings on their bodies that reached a hundred meters in length.

“That is the sea beast called Odd-eye Giant Wings Beast!” A Great Whale Sect Elder exclaimed.

Odd-eye Giant Wings Beast!

When the people nearby heard him, their faces paled.

This Odd-eye Giant Wings Beast was part of one of the many sea beasts tribes, quite a famous tribe as well, possessing powerful attack power, not to mention their speed and agility in the air. A Third Order Heavenly God Realm Odd-eye Giant Wings Beast’s speed was many times faster than a Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm human cultivator’s.

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a breath of cold air.

The sea beast tide this time was at least several hundred million in number?!

Not only were the sea beasts’ numbers ten times more than the last attack, with the addition of the Odd-Eye Giant Wings Beast, South Huai City would also be hard to defend simply just relying on the current number of human experts present within the city.

A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“Yao Chi, you wait here inside the city for me to come back.” Huang Xiaolong turned and said to Yao Chi. Without waiting for her response, Huang Xiaolong left with the little cow, riding towards the swarm of sea beasts rushing toward the city.

“Xiaolong!” Yao Chi cried out anxiously, she was about to chase after Huang Xiaolong when his voice sounded in her ears through voice transmission.

Only after hearing what Huang Xiaolong said through voice transmission did she give up on chasing after him.

The Elephant Genesis Sect’s Hu Qing arrived and saw Huang Xiaolong riding straight into the swarm of sea beasts, sneering in disdain. Inwardly, he was ecstatic, thinking, ‘You want to become a hero? Then you’d better die trampled by these sea beasts!’

In Hu Qing’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong’s death was certain once he was overwhelmed by the raging sea beasts.

Facing a beast tide of this size, only Ancient God Realm masters that could teleport had a chance to survive.

The other of experts had different thoughts watching Huang Xiaolong rushing headlong toward the incoming beasts.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong and sea beasts collided.

Huang Xiaolong was holding the Zhenyu Silver Moon Blade, slashing out mercilessly. Black blade qi smoothly split apart the sea beasts in Huang Xiaolong’s path. At the same time, a ferocious wind vortex was gathering around Huang Xiaolong. Any beast that got too close to him was swallowed up by this wind vortex.

After these sea beasts were swallowed into the wind vortex, dried corpses would be thrown back out in a matter of seconds.

Even though there was a long distance between Huang Xiaolong and the people standing at the top of the city walls, they clearly saw what happened. Each of them secretly sucked in a breath of cold air watching Huang Xiaolong’s battle power, especially the two Elephant Genesis Sect’s Hu Qing and Yang Yun.

The little cow’s weapon of choice was its trusted pair of golden horns. Purple lightning net swept through the battlefield, burning numerous sea beasts into charcoal.

One person and one cow moved onward tirelessly.

Huang Xiaolong pushed his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power to the limit. As he absorbed these sea beasts’ energy, his hands did not stop swinging the Zhenyu Silver Moon Blade, slashing out clusters of black blade qi

A few minutes later, the number of sea beasts that died to Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s attacks exceeded thousands. Although a few thousand sea beasts weren’t that much, at this rate, in a day’s time, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s count would be closer to a hundred thousand.

Still, the movements on Huang Xiaolong’s side immediately attracted more powerful beasts.

Not far away, a late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm sea beast with two heads, eight legs, and three eyes flew toward him. Roaring, its giant palms slammed down on Huang Xiaolong from above. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This big animal had a trace of the primordial divine beast bloodline, the Sea Morning Beast. Despite only being a late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm, its strength was comparable to a peak late-Tenth Order cultivator.

Noticing this, Li Qingyang and Yang Yun could almost punch the air in excitement.
