Huang Xiaolong realized that Senior Brother Chen Hao had specifically waited for him, which made him feel embarrassed.

He understood that Senior Brother Chen Hao had not interrupted him in order to avoid affecting his cultivation, therefore, he had not sent him any message.

“Senior Brother, let us go then.” Huang Xiaolong said and smiled sheepishly.

Chen Hao nodded his head, but stopped abruptly and his head jerked to the side as he looked at Huang Xiaolong and exclaimed, “Mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm? You’ve already broken through to the mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm?”

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded for a second, hasn’t he broken through it already a month ago? Still, he answered honestly, “This is the merit of the Fortune Divine Fruits that Master gave me.”

Chen Hao blanked for a second then smiled wryly as he said, “When I was still in the Ancestor God Realm, Master had given me quite a lot of Fortune Divine Fruits as well, but my cultivation progress was not as fast as yours ah. You kid are a freak, period. Hall Master Zhang Dong did mention that your bone-age is below one thousand even though you have reached this point in cultivation. Now, I’ve finally witnessed your cultivation speed.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “Senior Brother is very talented ah, and based on Senior Brother’s talent, there is hope to breakthrough to Emperor Realm, isn’t it?”

Although Chen Hao wasn’t a supreme godhead genius, his godhead ranking was infinitely close to a supreme godhead; if he had the chance of a fortuitous adventure, he still had a chance to step into Emperor Realm. Otherwise, Zhao Lei wouldn’t have accepted him as his personal disciple.

Chen Hao shook his head, “It’s too difficult to break through to Emperor Realm. How many geniuses of my level has the Fortune Emperor Palace seen in the last ten billion years? However, those who have successfully broken through to Emperor Realm are only a handful of people. Even now, I’m still far away from advancing to high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm, as for Emperor Realm, I don’t dare to dream about it. You will understand when you have broken through to Heavenly Monarch.”

Everyone dreams of breaking through to the Emperor Realm, and Chen Hao naturally had. But as their cultivation realm reaches higher, and the longer they cultivate, they realize how difficult it is to reach the Emperor Realm.

He had almost lost his life when breaking through to Heavenly Monarch, what’s more to the Emperor Realm?

Huang Xiaolong and Chen Hao chatted as they walked out from the Tiger Dragon Palace Gardens and flew towards the Fortune Great Hall.

As the Tiger Dragon Palace Gardens was quite a distance away from the Fortune Great Hall, it took them a little over an hour of flying before arriving at the Fortune Great Hall.

But they made it in good time as there were still two hours before the apprenticeship ceremony started.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong suddenly thought of something and asked Chen Hao, “Senior Brother, our Fortune Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple will also attend the apprenticeship ceremony, right? I’ve heard that our Emperor’s Disciple is one of the few rare geniuses in the Divine World.”

Chen Hao blanked for a moment then chuckled as he said, “Our Emperor’s Disciple went to Hell some years back and hasn’t returned yet, however, he indeed is one of the few rarer geniuses in the Divine World. This is something widely acknowledged by everyone.” There was a revered smile on Chen Hao’s face as he spoke of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple. He added, “You will understand what I mean in the future when you meet our Emperor’s Disciple.”

Went to Hell? This answer was a little unexpected for Huang Xiaolong. At the same time, he was slightly disappointed as well.

In that case, he won’t be able to see the Emperor’s Disciple in person, what a shame?

Huang Xiaolong had always been suspecting if the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple was Fang Chu’s main body? There were times when an avatar’s appearance differed from the main body, which was why he could only be certain if the Emperor’s Disciple was Fang Chu after seeing him in person.

“The Emperor’s Disciple went to Hell for training?” Huang Xiaolong asked casually.

Chen Hao nodded, “This is not a secret. The Emperor’s Disciple has gone to Hell to train, specifically, he went to Hell’s Asura World. A thousand years ago, the Emperor’s Disciple broke through to Heavenly Monarch while he was training in the Devil World. You might not believe it, but our Emperor’s Disciple’s bone-age is not very high, it’s below thirty thousand years.”

Below thirty thousand years. This was really hard to believe, and according to Chen Hao, the Emperor’s Disciple had broken through to Heavenly Monarch a thousand years ago.

In the whole Divine World, a Heavenly Monarch master below thirty thousand years was rarer than rare.

Huang Xiaolong continued to inquire about the Emperor’s Disciple and Fortune Emperor Palace as he chatted with Chen Hao.

Chen Hao did not think too much into Huang Xiaolong’s curious questions, and told him everything he knew about Fortune emperor palace.

In Chen Hao’s opinion, any Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple would be interested to know about the Emperor’s Disciple. It was normal.

The Fortune Emperor’s Disciple was an existence that all the Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples revered.

...

The two flew onwards. Along the way, the disciples who saw them stopped and respectfully salute d and greeted them.

An ecstatic voice suddenly rang in their ears, “Uncle!”

The voice was loud enough to make Huang Xiaolong and Chen Hao stop in midair.

Uncle!

Hearing this familiar voice and familiar greeting, Huang Xiaolong already knew who the voice belonged to.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and an adorable young woman flew happily towards him with a cute smile on her face. There was a large group of people following behind her.

Among this group were the two old men who had taken Bei Xiaomei away the last time. But judging from the attire of the other few in the group, they didn’t seem like they were her guards...? Perhaps, other Emperor Palaces’ young lords or the likes?

“Uncle, it’s really you ah! Haha, Uncle, I’m so happy. I didn’t expect to run into you like this.” Bei Xiaomei stopped in front of Huang Xiaolong, laughing and jumping like a happy kid.

She happily pulled Huang Xiaolong’s arm.

Jaws and eyes dropped behind Bei Xiaomei. All of them stared at Huang Xiaolong in astonishment, and a moment later, each had a different expression on their faces, especially the few Emperor Palaces’ young lords who had accompanied Bei Xiaomei.

Even though Bei Xiaomei usually appeared sweet and innocent, she mostly ignored them. They had never seen Bei Xiaomei treating someone of the opposite gender the way she did Huang Xiaolong!

Even Chen Hao had a dumbfounded look on his face.

As a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder, as well as Zhao Lei’s personal disciple, Chen Hao had naturally recognized that this sweet and innocent looking young woman was none other than the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss, Bei Xiaomei!

The Silver Fox Commerce, the Divine World’s number one trading house’s Second Miss and his Junior Brother knew each other? And judging from what he could see, Bei Xiaomei was specifically pulling Huang Xiaolong’s hand. A weird expression rose to his face. But he was soon elated; if his Master found out about this, he would probably be overjoyed.

At this time, Bei Xiaomei finally noticed Huang Xiaolong’s robe as she was busy pulling his hand. She exclaimed exaggeratedly, “Uncle, you’re a Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple now?”

Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless.

He was a Fortune Emperor Palace’s branch disciple from the beginning. There was nothing strange that he was a Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple now.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and smiled as he said, “Some time back the Fortune Emperor Palace recruited emperor rank godhead disciples from various branches, I registered and passed the examination and assessment.” He tried to pull out his hand from Bei Xiaomei’s grip, but he discovered that she was holding on to it quite firmly and making it impossible for him to do so.

After seeing this, Huang Xiaolong could only endure the several different murderous glares directed at him.

“In the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, you said you would come to find me, but so long has passed, you didn’t come find me.” Bei Xiaomei pouted, looking extremely unhappy.

No matter how one looked at it, she was sulking.

The murderous glares already directed towards Huang Xiaolong intensified.

Huang Xiaolong explained bitterly, “I was planning to visit you after the apprenticeship ceremony.” He was telling the truth, he had planned to visit her after the ceremony, as he had planned to make a trip to the Heavens Avenue to get all the required materials to further repair the Dragon Shark Flying Ship. At that time, he had planned to go see Bei Xiaomei.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
