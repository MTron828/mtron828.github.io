Hearing the golden-robed young man’s words, a dangerous light flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

In the distance, the same waiter shifted anxiously, wanting to persuade the golden-robed young man yet at the same time was afraid to do so, thus ended up hiding in a corner of the back yard when he saw Huang Xiaolong walking over. He hurried over to Huang Xiaolong’s side, “Young master, that is the Cao Family’s Young master, Cao Bishi, he...”

Cao Family?

Cao Bishi?

Huang Xiaolong sneered.

He ignored the waiter and continued marching toward the golden-robed young man.

As for the little cow’s situation, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried at all. The dozen First Order and Second Order Heavenly God Realm cultivators were incapable of hurting it in the lest.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had yet to understand what led to this, he was certain this conflict definitely wasn’t provoked by the little cow.

He knew the little cow’s temperament.

Huang Xiaolong’s appearance caught Cao Bishi’s attention, especially when he saw the waiter anxiously trying to explain the situation to him, Cao Bishi understood that this black-haired young man must be that cow’s owner, thus he vented his anger from being kicked by the little cow on Huang Xiaolong, pointing a finger at his face, “Punk, this cow of yours kicked me just now, roll over here this instant! Your cow kicked me one time, so I’ll kick you a hundred times!”

Huang Xiaolong stopped a few feet from Cao Bishi, a frosty expression on his face. In the next second, he raised his leg and sent a kick onto Cao Bishi’s chest.

Cao Bishi did not expect this cow owner would dare to attack him, not to mention the fact that he was just a First Order Heavenly God Realm, how could he dodge Huang Xiaolong’s kick? The kick sent Cao Bishi soaring high in the air like a pinball.

The waiter was dumbstruck by Huang Xiaolong’s kick, his face becoming ashen as his gaze followed Cao Bishi’s figure in the sky.

Cao Family! That was one of the big families of Green Cloud Island!

This Cao Bishi was a core disciple of the family! If any mishap happened to him or he died inside their restaurant, the restaurant owner would be buried together with him.

The dozen Cao Family guards were pale when they saw their young master being kicked to the sky by the black-haired young man.

“Young Master Bishi!” At this moment, these Cao Family guards couldn’t be bothered with the little cow anymore. Some of them retreated, trying to catch Cao Bishi before he fell, while others flew up to the sky.

Finally, Cao Bishi was rescued by the guards.

Huang Xiaolong ignored these people, striding to the little cow’s side, “Xiaoniū, what happened?” He asked, gently rubbing the little cow’s jadeite body.

The little cow briefly recounted what happened to Huang Xiaolong.

It started when Cao Bishi was passing by the restaurant’s back yard. He caught a glimpse of the little cow and, feeling it was extraordinary, he wanted to take it away. What happened next was obvious.

“All of you, kill this punk, kill this punk and that cow!” Cao Bishi bellowed after he was rescued by the Cao Family guards, enduring the pain of broken ribs in his chest while sucking in shallow breaths with difficulty. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At his order, the group of Cao Family guards exchanged silent looks among themselves, then pounced on Huang Xiaolong.

Although they were aware that Huang Xiaolong’s strength was above theirs, they needed to obey since young master Bishi had commanded.

However, just as these Cao Family guards moved, the little cow threw its head back, letting out a thunderous moo that spread outwards.

Bright streaks of lightning lit up the back yard, turning it into a sea of lightning.

All the Cao Family guards were struck by the zigzagging lightning and knocked backward. When they fell to the ground, their bodies were burnt charcoal black from head to the end of their toes. Even if they hadn’t died on the spot, they weren’t far from death.

Cao Bishi looked in horror at the dozen guards lying on the ground, his face drained of blood. His earlier rage and killing intent disappeared as his gaze finally fell on Huang Xiaolong and the little cow.

That waiter was already stupefied. When he brought the little cow to the back yard earlier, its docile manner and lovely appearance easily misled him, thinking it was just a common mount.

Who would have thought...! Cold sweat trickled down the waiter’s face.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong approached Cao Bishi.

“Don’t, don’t kill me, I’m a core disciple of Cao Family. The Barbarian God Sect’s Grand Elder Cao Yang is my grandfather!” Cao Bishi announced with false bravado.

“Cao Yang.” Huang Xiaolong frowned, his steps stopped for a moment.

Huang Xiaolong had indeed heard of this Cao Yang. He also knew that this Cao Yang was one of the Grand Elders supporting Chen Hao, their relationship tied with great mutual benefits. Huang Xiaolong even heard that this Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei had been adamant to penalize him when he wounded Chen Xiong in the past. They even brought up the request of locking him in the dungeon.

Seeing that his words were effective, Cao Bishi’s tone hardened, “That’s right, the Barbarian God Sect’s Grand Elder Cao Yang is my second grandfather! The reason I came to Pingyi City this time is precisely to meet my second grandfather. If you dare...”

Before Cao Bishi could finish his words, Huang Xiaolong swung a Great Void Divine Fist at him, striking Cao Bishi’s chest.

Cao Bishi howled in pain, crashing into the wall.

Mouthfuls of blood spurted out from his mouth, his eyes filled with fear and disbelief, “You, why?” He could not understand, this black-haired young man wasn’t afraid of their Cao Family? Not afraid of his grandfather Cao Yang? Cao Yang was a Barbarian God Sect Grand Elder.

“Why? When you see Cao Yang, you can ask him. Tell him that my name is Huang Xiaolong.” he smiled coldly then leaped onto the little cow’s back. “Xiaoniū, let’s go.”

The waiter watched dazedly as Huang Xiaolong left on the cow’s back, not daring to hinder him.

‘Huang Xiaolong?’ Cao Bishi repeated the name under his breath, committing it to memory with hatred and killing intent.

After leaving the restaurant, Huang Xiaolong left Pingyi City, making his way to the Barbarian God Sect.

Three days later, he was back in the Barbarian God Sect with seven to eight days left before the three sects inner disciples joint training. He then flew straight to his own mansion and entered seclusion.

Although he had full confidence in obtaining the first place in this joint training, increasing his strength as much as possible wasn’t a bad thing.

As for Cao Yang, Huang Xiaolong already threw him to the back of his mind.

Since Cao Yang was someone who had stood opposite him from the beginning, Huang Xiaolong naturally need not behave depending on Cao Yang’s mood. Moreover, after the three sects’ joint training, he would be able to break through to Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm. At that time, he could advance to a core disciple. Huang Xiaolong was confident that even a Grand Elder like Cao Yang didn’t pose much of a threat to him with the ‘talent’ he displayed.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong returned to his mansion, Cao Bishi and Cao Family guards were meeting Cao Yang. Looking at Cao Bishi and the guards’ sorry state, Cao Yang could barely restrain his anger, “You’re saying that despite knowing I’m your second grandfather, that Huang Xiaolong still injured you to this extent?!”

Thinking of Huang Xiaolong, hatred and killing intent surged from Cao Bishi’s body as he responded, “Yes, Second Grandfather, you absolutely must seek justice for me ah, kick that Huang Xiaolong out from the Barbarian God Sect and capture him for me. If I don’t kill him, the hate in my heart can’t be vented.”

On the way, Cao Bishi had found out that Huang Xiaolong was an inner disciple of the Barbarian God Sect.
