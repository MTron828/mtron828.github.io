Chapter 2681: Pangu World

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised when he heard Long Jianfei’s explanation. The Dragon Fish Creed was indeed related to the God of Creation, Huang Long.

Long Jianfei continued, “The Supreme Master of our Dragon Fish Creed is one of the attendants of the God of Creation himself!”

Huang Xiaolong was finally taken aback. He had guessed that the Dragon Fish Creed had something to do with the God of Creation, but he hadn’t expected that their relationship would be as such! The Supreme Master of the Dragon Fish Creed was actually an attendant of the God of Creation!

Long Haiqin was equally as shocked.

By this time, he finally realized the reason behind their respect for Huang Xiaolong.

If Huang Xiaolong really was the son of the God of Creation, the entire Dragon Fish Creed would be nothing more than his servants!

After all, an attendant was nothing more than a glorified way to address a servant.

That would also mean that the countless Dao Venerables, Primal Ancestors, and the uncountable number of cultivators were nothing more than the members under the Huang Family!

After all, every living creature in the Huang Long World was governed by the Huang Family!

Suppressing the raging emotions in his heart, Huang Xiaolong exhaled a long breath before asking, “Does that mean that I possess the blood of the God of Creation?”

“Young Lord, that is correct.” Long Jianfei failed to contain the excitement in his heart as he continued, “Even though you’re the first person I’ve seen with the Huang Long Bloodline, the records in the clan were clear. I am absolutely sure that you’re someone with Creator Huang Long’s bloodline! Moreover, the bloodline flowing through your veins is extremely pure!”

“Does that mean that Lord Huang Long is currently in your Dragon Fish Creed?” a light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he asked. If that was the case, he might actually be able to meet his lord father when he went to the Divine Tuo Holy World!

Long Jianfei was startled, but he soon shook his head. “Unfortunately, that’s not true. No one knows where His Lordship is. According to the ancient records of our Dragon Fish Creed, His Lordship only appeared in the Divine Tuo Holy World once. Every single Dao Venerable appeared to greet him, and they managed to receive his teachings. Primal Ancestors like ourselves possess no qualifications to greet His Lordship.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned in response.

Only appeared in the Divine Tuo Holy World once?!

“In fact, His Lordship isn’t from our world,” Long Jianfei dropped a massive bomb all of a sudden.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned speechless. However, he soon managed to calm himself. Since the man was called the God of Creation, the entire world was probably created by him. How could his lord father could be an existence of the world he himself created?

Long Jianfei continued, “His Lordship was from a place called the Pangu World.”

“What?! Pangu World?!” Huang Xiaolong jumped in fright when he heard what Long Jianfei said. A look of disbelief was etched on his face.

Pangu?! Earth?!

A possibility flashed through his mind.

“So that’s what happened…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

It seemed as though the legends were true. Pangu was the creator of Earth when he split the heavens and earth.

Wouldn’t that mean that the creator of the world was…?

“Young Lord.” Long Jianfei called out to him when he realized that Huang Xiaolong was spacing out.

From what he saw, Huang Xiaolong seemed to know something about the Pangu World. Moreover, it wasn’t a simple understanding of the Pangu World…

Snapping back to reality, Huang Xiaolong replied, “Oh, I’m fine.” A spark lit up the bonfire of hope in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. In the past, he had been thinking of ways to return to Earth. However, it seemed completely impossible at the time. Now that he learned of the existence of the Pangu World, the fog that covered his eyes seemed to thin out.

The question right now was how to return to the Pangu World from the Huang Long World!

Staring at Long Jianfei, Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled. It was possible that the person before him held the secrets to the connection of the two worlds!

However, a weird look soon formed on Long Jianfei’s face when he heard the question. “Heading over to the Pangu World?!”

“What…?” A bad feeling appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

“If one wishes to enter the Pangu World from our Huang Long World, they will have to cross the Universal Black Hole! It contains terrifying universal space storms and even Primal Ancestors would be torn to shreds if they wish to pass through. Even experts at the Dao Venerable Realm wouldn’t be able to easily cross the universal space storms. One might be able to cross the storms when one becomes a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, but even then, it would be extremely dangerous.”

The sound of shattering rang in Huang Xiaolong’s head.

A Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable would barely be able to pass…

“In so many years, there were tons of Dao Venerables who had wanted to cross over into the Pangu World. However, none of them succeeded. Even Dao Venerables of my Dragon Fish Creed failed. The Dragon Fish Dao Venerable is an expert at the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, and he isn’t an ordinary Dao Venerable. Even someone like him failed to cross over!”

Huang Xiaolong felt the flames of hope dimming once again.

It seemed as though he had to advance to the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm before he could try to return.

However, with his twelve high-level Saint Fates, he would be at a level no other Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable could compare to when he actually arrived in that realm. With his level of strength, it was indeed possible for him to cross over to the Pangu World!

Soon after, he asked Long Jianfei about some matters regarding the Divine Tuo Holy World and the Dragon Fish Creed.

According to Long Jianfei, the Divine Tuo Holy World was truly boundless. It was several tens of thousands of times larger than the Holy World and the Alien Lands, and the number of geniuses there were uncountable! There were nearly infinite number of Holy Grounds, and one couldn’t be considered a peak expert unless they were at the Dao Venerable Realm! Creeds were the true peak powers in the Divine Tuo Holy World and Primal Ancestors were merely slightly stronger experts.

“I wonder, how is my master doing now…?” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. From what Long Jianfei had said, it wouldn’t be easy for Huang Xiaolong to locate the Cangqiong Old Man after entering the Divine Tuo Holy world.

The only part Huang Xiaolong was still curious about was the fact that Long Jianfei had managed to enter from the Divine Tuo Holy World.

“I encountered a crack in space and after trying everything I could, I ended up here.”

Beads of cold sweat dripped down Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.

Is that even possible…?

Huang Xiaolong mentioned the Divine Tuo Mountain in the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds, and Long Jianfei jumped in shock. “Divine Tuo Mountain?!”

“I’ve heard of it before, and it is indeed true that it links the Holy World to the Divine Tuo Holy World. I tried it myself, but I failed to cross over.”

Was it possible that only high-level Primal Ancestors could cross over?

Huang Xiaolong then spoke of the way the Cangqiong Old Man crossed over.

“It’s possible that one can only comprehend the grand dao contained in the Divine Tuo Mountain after reaching the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm. However, nothing is set in stone.” Long Jianfei shook his head while sighing.

He became slightly more depressed when he realized that his hopes of returning to the Divine Tuo Holy World were dashed.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Huang Xiaolong thought in another completely different direction. He wondered if he could bring others along with him when he crossed over, and since Long Jianfei was a member of the Dragon Fish Creed, it would be extremely convenient for him to bring the man over!

After mentioning his thoughts to Long Jianfei, Long Jianfei stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. “It might be possible.” After all, he was someone born in the Divine Tuo Holy World. There needn’t be a problem when he tried to cross into the other world with Huang Xiaolong. Moreover, he was only at the Primal Ancestor Realm. There needn’t be too much trouble.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong found a place to stay in the Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters. He planned to return to the Otherworldly Mansion after several days.
