Zhou Chen, who was reclined in his seat on the main table, shot to attention as he stared at Sun Shihai in disbelief.

His disciple, Sun Shihai, was defeated?!

He was defeated with a single slap from Huang Xiaolong!

Even though Sun Shihai had barely landed on the arena, everyone could see that his face was swollen beyond comparison. It swelled so much that they couldn’t even see his eyes!

“That... that’s Shihai?!” Zhou Chen muttered in disbelief.

Yan Ying nodded her head like a wooden chicken and stared blankly at Sun Shihai, “Yes... It’s junior brother Sun.”

She was shocked as the ending was completely different from what she expected. The person lying there should be Huang Xiaolong, not Sun Shihai!

Fang Gan, Li Shan, Chen Yirong, and the other elders and hall masters were unable to conceal their shock.

Just as everyone stared blankly at the sixth arena in shock, a roaring laughter entered their ears. Even someone who was deaf would be able to hear the unbridled joy behind the laughter.

As they slowly understood what was really going on, everyone turned to look at the source of the laughter.

Who else could it be other than Zhao Lei?

Under everyone’s gazes, Zhao Lei stood up and clapped his hands, “Great! This is awesome! Beautifully done! What an amazing fight!”

He showered praises and compliments non-stop.

He couldn’t really be blamed for being too sarcastic as Zhou Chen was the one who predicted that it would be a spectacular fight.

Right now, the ending was really amazing!

Of course, it was amazing for Zhao Lei. When it came to Zhou Chen and the members of the Snow Moon Palace, it was a completely different feeling.

The smile on Zhou Chen’s face was long gone. Instead, his expression was frosty.

He glared at Huang Xiaolong and he subconsciously tightened his fist.

Huang Xiaolong!!!!

As for Li Lu, Yao Chi, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao, they turned to look at Zhao Lei when he roared with laughter. Expressions of joy could be seen on their pretty little faces.

Fang Xuanxuan looked at Huang Xiaolong’s back and giggled, “This brat is always making us worry for him!”

Yao Chi chimed in, “Sister Xuanxuan, why are you worried for Huang Xiaolong?”

Fang Xuanxuan looked at the crafty smile on Yao Chi’s face and her face flushed red. She tried to defend herself, “Of course I’m afraid that he’ll get hurt! He’s Uncle Zhao’s disciple! If not for the fact that he saved me, I could care less about him!”

Peng Xiao laughed, “Of course! Could it be that you developed feelings for him after he saved your life?”

Li Lu covered her mouth as she chuckled softly.

“Fine! All of you are ganging up on me! Watch me take care of all of you when we get back!”

When they were bantering around, Sun Shihai struggled to crawl to his feet. He swept his gaze across the audience and saw everyone looking at him. A wave of humiliation hit him and he seemed to drown in disgrace.

He felt that it was more shameful than losing to Wang Yongsen in the past!

Sun Shihai screamed towards the sky and he looked exactly like a beast about to go berserk. His screams shook the heavens and murderous intent filled him as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. In the next second, he rushed towards his target.

His speed seemed to double as he lunged at Huang Xiaolong.

The power he unleashed previously paled in comparison to the aura he was emitting right now.

As black light pulsed around his body, jet-black rays pierced into the eyes of all the audience members.

He seemed to turn into a ball of black light as he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone felt their jaws drop.

“What astonishing speed! Is this his hidden trump card? His strength and speed increased by one fold after going berserk!”

“His trump card is too scary if that is the case. One has to know that his bloodline has barely been activated. If he were to carry on training, will he be able to grow stronger in the future? What if his speed and strength can increase by ten, no twenty, no, fifty times?!”

One of the Hall Masters exclaimed in shock.

Fang Gan, Li Shan, and Chen Yirong blanked out for a second.

Zhou Chen, whose expression was one of despair, felt a newfound hope rising in his heart.

When Fang Gan and the others were lost in their shock, Sun Shihai’s attack had already appeared before Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Looking at the berserk Sun Shihai whose speed and power had doubled, Huang Xiaolong casually sent out another slap.

This time, brilliant light wrapped itself around Huang Xiaolong’s palm and its might completely suppressed the black light around Sun Shihai’s body.

“Smack!” A crisp slap resounded through the air.

Under the astonished gazes of everyone present, Sun Shihai was sent flying once again. This time, he did several flips in the air. Ignoring the aesthetic department of his flips, his clothes ripped more and more with every flip he did.

By the time he landed back on the arena, his clothes were in tatters.

The shocked cries of many female disciples filled the hall.

Li Lu, Fang Xuanxuan, and the other ladies hastily covered their eyes with their hands.

Even from the main table, the elders were able to see that Sun Shihai’s face was deformed. Before he was slapped again, they were able to make out his facial features. However, it just looked like a lump of flesh now.

Sun Shihai’s nose was crooked and his eyes were shaking. It seemed as though he was suffering from a seizure.

Trying his best to crawl back to his feet, he failed and crumpled to the ground. Despite his injuries, Sun Shihai’s blood-red eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong, as if he couldn’t wait to devour him whole.

Huang Xiaolong was completely indifferent to whatever was going on.

At that moment, Fang Gan turned to Zhang Chen and nodded his head.

The main hall master of the Hall of Supreme Harmony took a step forward and announced, “Second round of the selections, number six arena. Huang Xiaolong is the victor!”

The moment the words left Zhang Chen’s lips, the whole hall erupted.

“I knew it! Didn’t I say that Martial Uncle Huang was going to win?!”

“Nonsense! I heard you say that you were supporting Martial Uncle Sun!”

“... You heard wrong.”

Fervent discussions broke out among the audience.

Zhao Lei turned and smiled at Zhou Chen, “Ancestor Zhou Chen, I felt that it was an amazing battle. What do you think?”

Zhou Chen’s lips twitched and he refused to reply.

Zhao Lei wasn’t affected by Zhou Chen’s lack of reply and he continued, “I never thought that Sun Shihai would possess the bloodline of an Archdevil from the grandmist era. I really envy you for being able to accept such an outstanding disciple.”

If Zhao Lei had said this when Sun Shihai was displaying his power, Zhou Chen would have laughed in his face. Right now, Zhou Chen couldn’t find it in him to break a smile.

Before long, the results of the second round were out.

There were around 800 disciples who passed the selections and more disciples could be chosen to fill the last 100 spots. It was too bad for Sun Shihai that his injuries were too serious and he wasn’t able to join in the final round of selections. He could only give up the chance to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

The next round of selections rolled around but before they could continue to draw their opponents. Huang Xiaolong decided to leave.

Everyone was shocked at his decision and even Fang Gan couldn’t comprehend his actions.

“Xiaolong, are you really planning to stop competing?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “Yes, Sect Master.” Right now, he already obtained the rights to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. There wasn’t any point in going further. He didn’t care about the rewards anyway and he wasn’t confident of achieving the first place. After all, Liu Yong wasn’t Sun Shihai. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s decision, Fang Gan felt that it was rather regrettable. However, a smile eventually appeared on his face. “Alright then.”
