Chapter 3727: Break His Legs

“You heard me,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince roared with laughter and pointed at Huang Xiaolong mockingly, “Did you hear that? This brat said that he plans to cripple me!”

The experts of the Golden Phoenix Race burst out laughing.

One of the experts of the Golden Phoenix Race approached the crown prince and said, “Your Highness, should we break his legs right now?”

He looked at the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng behind Huang Xiaolong and continued, “Should we break their legs too?”

The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince chuckled, “Alright, break them all. There’s no need to waste time with them.”

“Yes, Your Highness!” The expert laughed and started walking towards Huang Xiaolong and the others.

The expert from the Golden Phoenix Race who approached them wasn’t weak. He was someone who closed in on the 20 billion mark, and his strength was stronger than the experts who were fighting earlier.

Yang Dingsheng might have known how strong Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer were, but he felt a sense of panic sweeping through his heart when he saw the expert from the Golden Phoenix Race approach. After all, the Golden Phoenix Race was known as one of the hegemons in the Fortune Space. An existence like the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince was more than enough to scare the old ancestors of the Yang Lightning Race into submission.

A sneer formed on the crown prince’s face when he saw the expression on Yang Dingsheng’s face. He had long since recognized the man.

When the expert from the Golden Phoenix Race arrived before Huang Xiaolong, the White Deer, and Yang Dingsheng, a golden light surrounded his fist and he punched towards the trio.

He controlled his strength perfectly. Since the crown prince only wanted to break their legs, he would do just that. Moreover, he knew that the crown prince didn’t wish for them to die so soon. He wanted to torture them as he wished later.

It was too bad his attack was stopped a hundred feet away from Huang Xiaolong and the others. The energy wave that was supposed to shatter their legs hovered in the air without dissipating.

The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince gasped in shock and so did everyone else watching the farce.

“Lord Cao Cheng, who would have thought that the youngster is an expert?!” the expert from the Dazzling Black Race who was fighting earlier exclaimed.

All of them knew how strong Yang Dingsheng was. As such, they quickly associated the person who stopped the attack with Huang Xiaolong. From how easily he stopped it, his combat strength should have crossed the 20 billion mark.

Even in the Fortune Space, he would be considered a supreme expert!

After all, very few experts crossed the 20 billion units mark in the Fortune Space.

Cao Cheng might be surprised by Huang Xiaolong’s strength, but a cold snort left his lips. “So what? After offending the Golden Phoenix Race, he’s dead anyway.”

The expert from the Golden Phoenix Race felt his expression sinking and a cold snort left his lips. Golden light surrounded his body. It was clear that he planned to go all out.

An endless amount of power poured out from his body as the golden light lit up the lands.

At the same time, a giant hammer appeared in his hand as it smashed towards Huang Xiaolong. In an instant, the skies seemed to be covered by countless mountain-sized golden hammers.

Huang Xiaolong crossed his arms behind his back as he watched the hammers getting closer.

Everyone couldn’t help but break out into discussion at the side.

“This brat is crazy! Even if he crossed the 20 billion mark, he should defend himself! He’s obviously looking down on Huang Quan!”

“When Huang Quan smashes him into a meat paste, I’ll call out in celebration!”

Several experts in the crown sneered at Huang Xiaolong’s reaction.

Seeing as the hammer was about to slam into his head, Huang Xiaolong casually raised a finger to stop it.

With a light flick, the giant hammer was shattered into countless pieces. The expert from the Golden Phoenix Race, Huang Quan, was sent smashing through god knows how many mountain peaks before landing at the edge of the continent.

The explosions that happened when he crashed through the mountains echoed through the skies.

Cao Cheng and those standing around stared at him in shock.

The faces of those from the Golden Phoenix Race changed.

Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them as he turned to look at the crown prince’s legs. “Right now, you have already crossed the mark that I’ve set.”

The crown prince of the Golden Phoenix Race never intended to listen to Huang Xiaolong. That was why he approached the lake when the exchange was going on.

Everyone thought of Huang Xiaolong’s threat and someone in the crowd gasped, “Don’t tell me he’s really going to cripple the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince?!”

That was an absurd notion! Everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong was messing around when he spoke earlier, but it seemed as though he was going to follow through with his threat!

“Even if he plans to cripple the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince, he might not be strong enough to do so.” An ancient ancestor in the crown sneered, “The crown prince has more than 22 billion units of combat strength. That brat might be strong, but he isn’t a match for His Highness!”

“That’s right! Lord Huang Ruocheng is here too. He’s someone who reached the 23 billion units mark!”

Chaos broke out as everyone chattered among themselves.

The crown prince snorted as a light of mockery flashed in his eyes. “So what if I did? Who do you think…”

Before he could complete his sentence, a ray of light shot through the skies and he felt a sharp pain shooting through his legs. In the next instant, he was sent tumbling through the air.

The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince landed on the ground and his face was covered in dust.

Everyone saw that his legs had been completely shattered.

“What?!”

The experts of the various races yelled in fright.

“Your Highness!” Huang Ruocheng of the Golden Phoenix Race gasped before running to the crown prince’s side.

When he realized what had happened, the crown prince’s heart was filled with endless rage. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and roared, “Who the f*ck are you?!”

“Huang Xiaolong.”

“Huang Xiaolong?!” Everyone looked at each other in surprise. “Could he be the owner of the Blue Dragon Manor?”

“No way… Isn’t he said to only possess 15 billion units of combat strength?”

Suppressing the hatred in his heart, the crown prince growled, “You better not come to the Fortune Space in the future. Otherwise, I’ll make sure you suffer a fate ten thousand times worse than mine!”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Unexpectedly, he ordered for the members of the Golden Phoenix Race to retreat after he laid down his threat!

Before he left, he glared at Yang Dingsheng. “Humph, Yang Dingsheng from the Yang Lightning Race…”
