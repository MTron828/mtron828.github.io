When Sun Man saw that Huang Xiaolong was walking over to him, he felt the blood draining from his face. He shrunk into a ball and stared at Huang Xiaolong with a pitiful look.

With so many precedents, Sun Man didn’t dare to say a word to Huang Xiaolong.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the pitiful expression on Sun Man’s face, he found it a little funny. Am I really so scary?

“Get up.” Huang Xiaolong ordered.

Sun Man was stunned. Get up?!

A frown slowly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he repeated himself. “If I ask you to get up, get up.”

Sun Man didn’t dare to hesitate as he got to his feet in an instant. He felt like he had barely crawled back from the gates of hell as he knew that Huang Xiaolong was planning to spare his life.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong had already asked Huang Xiaohai and the Ascending Moon Old Man about the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s situation before making his way to the plaza. He knew that Sun Man wasn’t on Wangu Wudi’s side. He didn’t support Wangu Wudi’s decision to destroy the Huang Family, and he was merely trying to protect himself by sitting on the fence.

That was the only reason he had managed to keep his life.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t possibly kill all the elders in the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. He still had to leave a few of them to control the overall situation.

“Pass down my order. Activate the protective formation of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. Block off everything from the outside world.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice resounded through the air.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t want the news of Wangu Wudi’s death to spread, in case he were to scare off the experts from the Ancient Demon Race, Ghost Refining Gate, and the members of the hundred superpowers.

If they managed to run away and hide in some desolate corner of the world, it would be a pain to look for all of them.

Since most of his relatives had already ascended to the Divine World, Huang Xiaolong wanted nothing more than to hurry up and return to their side. He no longer wanted to waste his time in the Lower World.

“Yes, President Huang!” Sun Man realized Huang Xiaolong’s intentions, and he quickly passed down the order. He ordered for all the disciples to open the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s protective array.

As soon as Sun Man turned around to give the order, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept through everyone present in the plaza. “I hope no one will try to leak the events that happened here. I’ll kill anyone who does that.”

As soon as Huang Xiaolong spoke, a cold wind blew through the plaza. Everyone who had their transmission symbols out felt a chill in their heart, and they hastily stopped everything they were doing.

Just several minutes ago, no one would have taken Huang Xiaolong seriously. However, everything was different now. His words held more weight than Wangu Wudi’s orders!

Very quickly, the formation started to run.

No one was allowed out of Divine Dan City.

“Big brother, we received news that there were lots of people trying to escape from Divine Dan City. They fought with the members of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union!” Half an hour after Huang Xiaolong had ordered for the protective formation to be opened, Huang Xiaohai returned to report to Huang Xiaolong.

“Oh?” A frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Which family are they from?”

“It’s the Cheng Family. Elder Cheng Ping is from their family.” Huang Xiaohai pointed towards one of the heads and said. “The Cheng Family’s disciples act as though the city belongs to them because they have elder Cheng’s support. They had never placed our Huang Family in their eyes, and there were times when they injured our Huang Family’s disciples.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “It seems as though the disciples of the Cheng Family haven’t gotten news of me killing Cheng Ping...”

If they were to learn of the news, they would probably avoid the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s members, much less clash with them.

“Let’s go and take a look.” Huang Xiaolong turned to Huang Xiaohai and the others and said. “We’ll use the time to hang the heads of Wangu Wudi, You Wuguang, Cheng Ping, and the others onto the city wall.”

Huang Xiaohai broke into laughter. “That’s right!” He paused for a moment before sighing, “What a shame I’m out of urine... I should have drank more water in the morning...”

Everyone roared with laughter when they heard what he said.

It was clear that Huang Xiaohai felt that he had failed to unload all of his grievances onto Wangu Wudi’s head.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong and the other Huang Family members started to make their way to the southern gate.

In less than an hour, the massive gates appeared before them. They could see several thousands of disciples trapped in the city by the protective formation. Some of them were even arguing loudly with the disciples from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. There were even several tens of disciples brawling with the members of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union.

Those fighting with the disciples from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union were precisely the disciples from the Cheng Family. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

One of them grabbed a disciple from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union after injuring him with a heavy blow. A cold voice escaped from his lips. “Who gave you the order to lock down the city? Do you know who we are? How dare you block our way!”

“I gave the order.” Huang Xiaolong’s chilly voice sounded from behind him.

Everyone turned around and stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

When the Cheng family’s disciples turned around, he caught sight of Huang Xiaohai beside Huang Xiaolong, and a trace of surprise flashed through his eyes. However, a sneer soon escaped his lips. “I see that the Huang Family Head is here. Huang Xiaohai, do you really think that you are the head of the Huang Family in its prime? How dare you collude with the disciples of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union to seal the city? Your Huang Family is worth less than a fart! Don’t you know that your family is about to be exterminated? Why are you still wasting everybody’s time by doing all these useless things?”

As soon as he completed his questioning, Huang Xiaohai’s slap arrived on his face. He was sent crashing into the city wall behind him.

Huang Xiaohai turned to Huang Xiaolong and said, “He’s Cheng Ping’s youngest son.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

Cheng Ping’s youngest son spat out mouthfuls of blood before crawling to his feet. He glared at Huang Xiaohai. “The Huang Family is about to be extinct! Huang Xiaohai, how dare you hit me? Aren’t you afraid of offending my father?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to waste his breath, and he simply turned to Huang Xiaohai and said, “Bring out Cheng Ping’s head.”

Under the stunned gazes of everyone present, Huang Xiaohai retrieved a head dripping with blood. Cheng Ping’s head appeared before everyone present, and they saw the look of undisguised fear on his face before he was killed. It even looked like he was begging for mercy before his death!

Cheng Ping’s youngest son stared at his father’s head before him, and he didn’t dare to blink.

“Take out the heads of Wangu Wudi and the others. Hang them all on the city gate.”

Huang Xiaohai did exactly as he was told, and the heads of Wangu Wudi and the others appeared in his hand.

When those around saw Wangu Wudi’s head, the sound of swallowing could be heard. Everyone present felt a bomb going off in their head as cold sweat drenched their back. As perspiration dripped down their foreheads, puddles of water formed on the ground.

Huang Xiaohai waved his hand. In an instant, the heads of Wangu Wudi, You Wuguang, Cheng Ping, and the others flew onto the city gates. With Wangu Wudi’s head in the center, their miserable expressions would welcome the arrival of any newcomers to Divine Dan City.
