Chapter 3142: If I'm Not Out In 10 Years

One finger-strike caused the heaven and earth to crumble!

All living beings crouched before the power of Di Shuang’s finger strike, and silence filled heaven and earth as if the life and death of all living creatures hung upon the power gathering in Di Shuang’s finger. Whoever he allowed to live would live, and who he wanted dead, would die!

Di Shuang’s finger force did not contain any absolute energy, yet Lei Qianqian and the others turned deathly pale. Only when one’s comprehension of grand dao had reached a certain threshold, one could exert this level of force that was comparable to a God of Creation!

“Princess, watch out!”

Sensing the terrifying power gathered in Di Shuang’s finger, the Lightning Phoenix Race’s eminent elders screamed out warnings as they threw attacks of various energies towards Di Shuang. Colors of radiance, darkness, lightning, and blaze splashed over the horizon.

Seeing this, Di Shuang raised his other hand and spread out his fingers, and the moment his fingers spread apart, all the Lightning Phoenix Race’s experts felt like heaven and earth was pulled into his palm. They became small as ants, and Di Shuang’s palm became the sky above their heads, and the earth below their feet!

Six great absolute energies of darkness, poison, metal, frost, wind, and blaze roiled under the suppression of this palm, trying to break out.

Lei Qianqian and the Lightning Phoenix Race’s experts were knocked into the air almost simultaneously.

Blood dyed the surroundings crimson.

After witnessing this sight, Li Tianyao and other Destiny Race’s experts, who were about to flee, stopped their movements abruptly. They didn’t dare to move even an inch.

“You all are the Death Beasts Perila Land’s ten beast kings!” one of the Destiny Race’s eminent elders blurted out with difficulty as he looked at Di Shuang, Di Fan, and the others. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Lightning Phoenix Race and Black Tiger Race’s experts, who were swept into the distance, felt their hearts stopped upon hearing that.

The Death Beasts Peril Land’s ten beast kings!

On top of that, even the leader of the ten beast kings was there!

Lei Qianqian was horror struck as she stared at Di Shuang. Needless to say, this was the leader of the ten beast kings, Di Shuang. She should have thought of this early on because only the ten beast kings from the Death Beasts Peril Land possessed such horrifying strength.

The ten beast kings!

She looked at Huang Xiaolong in bewildered shock. This young man, could he be…?!

Lei Qianqian wasn’t the only one, as even Li Tianyao and other Destiny Race’s experts were looking at Huang Xiaolong with the same bewilderment. Clearly, they had reached the same thought as Lei Qianqian.

Huang Xiaolong had previously defeated the Origin Holy World Master Xiao Tianqi, and battled and subjugated the nine of the beast kings alone. All these things were no secrets. What dumbfounded Lei Qianqian, Li Tianyao, and others was that the leader of the beast kings, Di Shuang, had also submitted to Huang Xiaolong!

Lei Qianqian was aware that the Origin Lands’ ten overlords had considered cooperating with Di Shuang to fight against Huang Xiaolong, yet Di Shuang was already Huang Xiaolong’s slave.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over Lei Qianqian, Li Tianyao, and others, and as he noted the expressions on their faces, he knew that these people had guessed his identity. Thus, he said, “Since you all already know my identity, kneel and submit.”

However, Hao Zheng could be heard muttering under his breath, “Huang Xiaolong, don’t forget that this is the Origin Lands, and even if your strength can pierce the sky, you’re no match against the ten overlords of our land. Our Lords can borrow the power of Origin Lands, and they are invincible on this land!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong asked indifferently.

Hao Zheng thought Huang Xiaolong was feeling the pressure, and he was planning to continue speaking. However, Huang Xiaolong raised a finger, and in the next second, a bloody hole appeared between Hao Zheng’s eyebrows. Hao Zheng’s body stiffened, and never could he have imagined that Huang Xiaolong would kill him so suddenly!

“Your Highness!” Hao Duo and other Black Tiger Race experts’ cries rang across the air as Hao Zheng’s body incinerated and turned into a pile of ashes. Gray ashes scattered across the Origin Sea by the sea wind.

“My words are only said once,” Huang Xiaolong stated coldly. He couldn’t care less about ten overlords.

With his current strength, even if the ten overlords joined hands, he could crush them just the same. Not to mention that he has the ten beast kings by his side now.

…..

An hour later.

Huang Xioalong looked at the people kneeling before him, and Lei Qianqian and Li Tianyao were among them. He shot the creation mark into their dao souls, before allowing them to get up.

Li Tianyao and the Destiny Race’s experts were smart enough, they were the first ones to submit to Huang Xiaolong, and upon seeing that, Lei Qianqian and the Lightning Phoenix Race followed suit. Only the Black Tiger Race continued with futile resistance and ended up having seven to eight of their experts getting killed by the ten beast kings.

Later on, Huang Xiaolong learned about the appearance of the Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle from Lei Qianqian and Li Tianyao.

On the Origin Sea’s side, in the nearby sea area, there were many Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle. How many exactly? Neither Lei Qianqian nor Li Tianyao knew about it, but one thing was for certain that there were a lot.

This was an unexpected pleasant surprise for Huang Xiaolong. In that case, there are more than two stalks of Flower of Time in this area?

Immediately, Huang Xiaolong, Di Shuang, Lei Yu, and the others spread out and searched. With Lei Qianqian’s Mysterious Eye of Ice and Li Tianyao as well as the Destiny Race experts’ deduction abilities, in the subsequent several months, Huang Xiaolong found a dozen of stalks Flower of Time, and even more Void Reincarnation Thistle, and there were more than fifty of them!

Huang Xiaolong was over the moon.

But several months later, after Huang Xiaolong flipped the sea area over, they didn’t find any more Flower of Time or Void Reincarnation Thistle. Huang Xiaolong finally gave up and continued further in the Origin Sea.

Huang Xiaolong ordered Lei Qianqian, Li Tianyao, and the others to return to the Origin Lands, leaving only Liu Shuo among them by his side.

Dangers lurked everywhere in the deeper parts of Origin Sea, and layers of restrictive formations were the norm. Among the three races, Li Shuo was the only one who wouldn't drag him back in this environment.

Moreover, Li Shuo had comprehended the powers of absolute time and space, and having Li Shuo stay beside Huang Xiaolong would assist his comprehension in both powers.

Mastering both the power of time and space, Li Shuo’s deduction ability was higher than others, which was a bigger help to Huang Xiaolong in locating the Son of Mystic.

In the subsequent days, Huang Xiaolong continued deeper into the Origin Sea as he looked for the Son of Mystic and Tree of Origin while refining Flowers of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistles, with the intention of comprehending the power of absolute time and space.

A year’s time went by quickly.

Huang Xiaolong’s group stopped above a certain golden island in the depths of Origin Sea, looking at the roaring waves before them. Space cracks filled their sights, as surging violent energy filled every inch of the world. Even Di Shuang, the leader of the beast kings, looked apprehensive.

“You guys wait for me here, if I don’t come out after ten years, leave the Origin Sea,” Huang Xiaolong said to Di Shuang, Lei Yu, and the rest. “I will contact you when I come out.”

Even someone with Si Long’s strength would have difficulty going further. Thus, it was better to let them wait there for him.

After exhorting Di Shuang and the rest, Huang Xiaolong accelerated and flew further in. At one point, even Huang Xiaolong’s Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, that had gone beyond perfection level, couldn’t endure the volatile energy around him. Therefore, he transform into the golden dragon of creation to continue onwards.
