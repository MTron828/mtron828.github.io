Chapter 3147: I Can’t Cultivate

The beast suddenly felt nervous when it saw Huang Xiaolong hesitate and seemingly ponder its suggestion. Since Huang Xiaolong was able to successfully comprehend thirteen elements’ energies which raised his strength to another level, especially the heavenly might coming from his Huang Long Bloodline, the beast was no longer capable of doing any harm to Huang Xiaolong. If Huang Xiaolong refused, it could only give up and leave.

Without the Tree of Origin, it was nothing but a pipe dream for it to cultivate the remaining six elements power to perfection level!

It had spent many years cultivating under the Tree of Origin by absorbing origin qi from the tree. But until now, only seven elements had reached perfection state, so without the Tree of Origin, how many years would it take to reach eight elements perfection? Or nine elements perfection?

As for the power of time and space, without the Tree of Origin, it was impossible for it to achieve perfection.

While the beast got nervous as time passed, Huang Xiaolong finally nodded and agreed, “Deal!”

Deal!

When Huang Xiaolong agreed, the beast’s nervous heart calmed down, as if a great burden had been lifted off its shoulders. Delighted inwardly, it said, “Then, let’s swear to the grand dao.”

It was afraid Huang Xiaolong would change his mind.

Huang Xiaolong noted the beast’s expression while responding tepidly, “Sure.”

In truth, his main purpose in entering the Origin Sea was the Tree of Origin, and whether the beast followed him or not, or whether it needed to borrow the Tree of Origin to cultivate, neither mattered to him.

At the end of the day, he had achieved his goal.

With the Tree of Origin in his hand, his speed in mastering the thirteen elements’ power would greatly increase.

Naturally, the beast’s hidden thoughts did not escape Huang Xiaolong. The beast agreed to let Huang Xiaolong take away the Tree of Origin, but did not choose to submit. Therefore, this was a treacherous creature! Who knows, once they were out of the Origin Sea, and its cosmos energy recovered fully, it would attack and snatch the Tree of Origin.

Huang Xiaolong sneered.

In that case, he would go with the flow and play the game with the beast.

Huang Xiaolong and the beast subsequently swore on the grand dao at the same time. The beast finally relaxed when it was done.

“You can take away the Tree of Origin now, and we’ll leave the Origin Sea.” The beast smiled amiably at Huang Xiaolong as it spoke, as if they had been friends for many years.

He had stayed in this bloody place for countless years and had long wanted to leave!

At its current strength, it was undefeatable outside the Origin Sea! All creatures would bow before it.

“There is no hurry,” Huang Xiaolong shook his head, and went on, “I have just started to comprehend the power of space and time, both powers are slightly unstable, and I can’t take away the Tree of Origin. I need to cultivate for some time, until my thirteen absolute powers stabilize.”

Didn’t the beast want to leave the Origin Sea as soon as possible? But now, Huang Xiaolong was going to make it wait.

He’s going to make the beast anxious like an insatiable itch.

As expected, the beast’s heart sank to its stomach when it heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted to cultivate for some time.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the beast’s reaction and sat down cross-legged leisurely under the Tree of Origin, and began circulating the Soaring Dragon Art to absorb the sea of origin qi on the supercontinent. He immersed himself in comprehending the thirteen elements of absolute powers.

The beast stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong, full of unstable energy! The brat was clearly making an excuse!

But it merely glared at Huang Xiaolong for a second, and did not do anything. It also lay under the Tree of Origin and began absorbing origin qi to recover its strength.

Didn’t Huang Xiaolong want to cultivate? Then it would take the time to recover its cosmos energy!

Both cultivated under the Tree of Origin, harboring their own thoughts.

It couldn’t deal with Huang Xiaolong here, but once they were out of the Origin Sea, it would make its move!

As Huang Xiaolong circulated the Soaring Dragon Art, he was akin to a great whale swallowing water and absorbing the surrounding’s origin qi at startling speed. Though Huang Xiaolong’s absorption speed was startling, it hadn’t reached an alarming degree. However, as time passed, Huang Xiaolong’s absorption speed increased tremendously, and a whirlwind of energy soon formed around him, rotating as it pulled in the entire supercontinent’s origin qi.

The big movement around Huang Xiaolong roused the beast out from its meditation, and when it opened its eyes and saw the giant whirlwind around Huang Xiaolong, it was genuinely taken aback. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It tried to absorb the surrounding origin qi, but it soon discovered that it could absorb ten percent less due to the whirlwind around Huang Xiaolong.

In the past, it was able to inhale one hundred strands of origin qi at one time, but now, it barely managed to get in a few strands!

In the last hundred years, it had greatly exhausted the cosmos energy within its small world, in order to recover fully, it would take several years at least. But at this rate, it would take several decades!

It circulated its cultivation technique with a frenzy, but it discovered that in a single inhale, it could only grab a few strands of origin qi! It couldn’t grab faster than Huang Xiaolong!

It was incensed. What kind of technique is this brat cultivating?! It was more domineering than the origin grand dao it had comprehended from the Tree of Origin itself.

“Stop!” it bellowed furiously at Huang Xiaolong and soundwaves rippled across, and Huang Xiaolong retreated from his cultivating state.

“What cultivation technique do you practice?” The beast glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong, “You're swallowing all the origin qi. How can I cultivate like this?!”

“That’s your problem,” Huang Xiaolong responded curtly and continued cultivating, circulating the Soaring Dragon Art.

Killing intent roiled within the beast’s pupils, but it made no further move. Both Huang Xiaolong and it had made a vow that neither would attack the other when they were cultivating under the Tree of Origin.

If it attacked Huang Xiaolong, the heavenly dao would punish it.

It had tasted the horror of divine punishment in the past and did not wish to experience it again.

It shot another hateful glare in Huang Xiaolong’s direction. Since I can’t cultivate, I won’t let you cultivate either!

It let out a roar, releasing soundwaves that disturbed the surroundings. It wanted to see how Huang Xiaolong was going to concentrate on cultivating! Causing disturbance to the surrounding was different to directly attacking Huang Xiaolong. This way, it wouldn’t trigger divine punishment.

But the result depressed the beast. In the next moment, Huang Xiaolong activated the Huang Long Armor and erected a protective barrier over himself. The soundwaves vibration did not affect Huang Xiaolong at all!

The beast came up with various methods to disturb Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation indirectly, but none of them worked. After gritting its teeth in resentment and anger for a long time, it gave up and tried to cultivate the best it could.

It regretted making a deal with Huang Xiaolong, as it had thought of many possibilities and situations except for this.

Under the Tree of Origin, Huang Xiaolong fully immersed himself into comprehending the thirteen elements' powers, and forgot about everything else. His state of mind blended into the surrounding that an era seemed to pass in a single breath. He felt he had turned into the Tree of Origin, and the Tree of Origin was him, while origin qi around him surged up and down.

As the lights around Huang Xiaolong grew stronger, dominating the supercontinent’s space, there were howling winds everywhere, but these lights and winds only ran wild within the scope of the supercontinent, and not a wisp leaked out.

Three hundred years and more went by quickly.

Huang Xiaolong’s comprehension lasted for over three hundred years.

His major completion power of radiance improved further, reaching the peak of major completion. It was already not far from perfection level. His absolute power of darkness was close to reaching major completion, and the power of metal, power of wind, and power of earth, had reached minor completion.
