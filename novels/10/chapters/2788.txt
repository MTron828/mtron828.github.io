The other five instantly understood his meaning.

According to Yang Jia’s plan, they would attract the experts in the Immemorial Immortal Cave over to kill Huang Xiaolong.

“If that’s the case, the Qilin Chariot will definitely land in the hands of the Saint Devil Prince. If that happens, we will never be able to fight for it…” One of the Primal Ancestors frowned.

Yang Jia explained as he shook his head, “That might not be the case. When the Saint Devil Prince leads his men over to surround Huang Xiaolong, they might get seriously injured by the Immemorial Qilins. If that happens, we can make our move and suppress the qilins!”

A flash of excitement filled the hearts of those present, instantly.

“That’s right! We’ll leave the moment we obtain the qilins! As long as we leave the Immemorial Immortal Cave, we’ll be able to look for a place to hide. The Saint Devil Prince won’t be able to do anything to us…”

“However, did you think about how Huang Xiaolong managed to defend against the attacks of the Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin previously?!” Yang Jia asked with a face full of doubt. “Could he really be backed by a formations master? Did the expert follow him here?”

He couldn’t think of any other reason why Huang Xiaolong would be able to stop the attacks of the Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin on his own.

Not to mention a Ninth Heaven True Saint, even experts at their level, the peak of the late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, might not be able to escape unharmed! How in the world did Huang Xiaolong do it?!

He felt that there was something wrong about all that. He was apprehensive of the secrets Huang Xiaolong was hiding, and that was the other reason he had stopped the other five from making a move.

“Who cares if there’s a formations master behind him? Even if there is one, he’ll die when he’s surrounded by thousands of Primal Ancestors!” Someone among them sneered.

After Huang Xiaolong left, he didn’t continue to search blindly.

Previously, he didn’t know where the eye of the formation was, and he had no idea how the Immemorial Immortal Cave was built. With the Qilin Chariot, there was no longer such a problem!

The Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin were the mounts of the Immemorial Dao Venerable, and they were extremely familiar with the place.

Very quickly, he asked about the formation that controlled the entire immortal cave.

“Young Lord, the old master refined the Immemorial Sword in the past. As long as you locate the sword, you’ll be able to locate the eye of the formation.”

The person they referred to as their old master was none other than the Immemorial Dao Venerable.

“Immemorial Sword!” Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock. “Do you know where the sword is?”

The Immemorial Fire Qilin spoke up all of a sudden, “ All we know is that the sword is kept in the Immemorial Dao Palace. We have no idea where the palace is…”

Immemorial Dao Palace!

Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated as he brought the two of them along to look for the Immemorial Dao Palace.

Anyone with half a brain would know that the Immemorial Dao Palace was located at the core of the Immemorial Immortal Cave. It was where the Immemorial Dao Venerable cultivated, and one could easily imagine the shocking treasures housed in the palace.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was heading over to the core regions of the Immemorial Immortal Cave, the six Primal Ancestors had already started to spread the news of Huang Xiaolong’s newfound treasure.

As soon as the news spread, thousands of Primal Ancestors in the immortal cave were riled up.

Those who could enter were definitely experts of their factions. If one wasn’t a high-level Primal Ancestor, they could forget about fighting for the Immemorial Immortal Cave. They knew the value of the Qilin Chariot the moment Yang Jia and the others started stirring sh*t.

“The Qilin Chariot actually appeared! Listen to my orders, experts of Ice Soul Sacred Land, hunt Huang Xiaolong down! You have to bring the Qilin Chariot back to me! We can forgo everything else here, but we have to obtain the Qilin Chariot!”

“Regardless of your methods, hunt him down!”

“Seal off the entrance to the Immemorial Immortal Cave!”

Since those who entered were probably patriarchs of their factions, they quickly passed down their order to their followers. They would stop at nothing to kill Huang Xiaolong.

In the spaces above one of the distant mountain ranges, the Saint Devil Prince waved his arm and a divine peak burst apart. A grand dao vein flew into his palm.

The grand dao spiritual vein was like a heavenly river that was filled with grand dao energy. The immemorial grand dao energy in it rolled about like a beast awakening from a slumber and the entire river spanned several hundred thousand miles long.

“What a massive grand dao spiritual vein…” the Saint Devil Prince smiled and commented.

With a flash of light, the grand dao spiritual vein started its struggle. It tore through the skies and charged into the distance.

As if he had expected it, the Saint Devil Prince soared into the skies and saint devil light emerged from his body to lock down the entire area. He suppressed the grand dao spiritual vein in an instant before using his grand dao artifact to subdue it.

When the experts of the Saint Devil Sacred Land saw what happened, they offered their congratulations.

“Hahaha! With this grand dao spiritual vein, I’ll be able to reach the peak of the late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm soon! I’ll definitely obtain the number one spot in the Blue Heaven Creed’s test!”

The test would commence in three hundred years, and as long as he managed to obtain the top rank, he would be able to enter the inner regions of the Blue Heaven Creed to cultivate. When that happened, he would be able to break through to the Dao Venerable Realm with ease!

“Your Highness…” Zhu Yu stepped forward all of a sudden to make a report. “We just received news that the Qilin Chariot made its appearance!”

The experts surrounding him gasped in shock, and the Saint Devil Prince couldn’t hide his excitement.

“Qilin Chariot! Isn’t that the Immemorial Dao Venerable’s mount?” The Saint Devil Prince continued.

“That’s right.” Zhu Yu nodded his head. “According to Yang Jia and the others, they personally confirmed its appearance.” Stopping for a short moment, he continued, “However, Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain it, and he’s riding the chariot around now.”

“What?! Huang Xiaolong?!” The Saint Devil Prince and the others stared at Zhu Yu in stunned silence.

“How on earth did the members of the Cangqiong Alliance enter the Immemorial Immortal Cave?!” A trace of suspicion appeared in his eyes.

There were layers upon layers of restrictions around the entrance, and there were even two Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors guarding the place. It didn’t make sense for members of the Cangqiong Alliance to appear inside the cave.

“This… We have no idea.” Zhu Yu shook his head. “From what we’ve gathered, Huang Xiaolong entered alone! The experts of the Cangqiong Alliance are nowhere to be seen.”

“Huh?!” The Saint Devil Prince couldn’t believe what he heard.

Wasn’t Huang Xiaolong a True Saint?! How on earth did a True Saint enter the Immemorial Immortal Cave?!

Zhu Yu was extremely curious about it too. “Yang Jia said that they only saw Huang Xiaolong acting alone… Could it be that there really is a formations master supporting him?! Did the formations master enter the Immemorial Immortal Cave too?!”

Rage surged through the Saint Devil Prince’s heart when he heard what Zhu Yu said. “Enough! Zhu Yu, you had better not bring up the topic again! Even my Blue Heaven Creed isn’t fortunate enough to nurture a formations master. The Cangqiong Alliance will never be able to gain the support of one! Even if a formations master is tired of cultivating, he’ll never stay beside a True Saint like Huang Xiaolong! If you refuse to stop talking about it and cause our morale to suffer, I’ll deal with you like a traitor all the same! You can forget about all the merits you gained in the past!”

Zhu Yu trembled in his shoes, and he no longer dared to speak a word.

“Where is he right now? Have you located him?!” The Saint Devil Prince snapped once again.

“No… The Qilin Chariot moved too quickly. All we know is that Huang Xiaolong should have gone in the southeastern direction…” Zhu Yu replied hastily.

“Southeast…” The Saint Devil Prince soared through the skies and shot towards where Huang Xiaolong might have headed.

When the others saw him moving, they didn’t dare to dally as they followed closely behind.

Swallowing his words, Zhu Yu could only sigh as he followed behind the Saint Devil Prince.
