Huang Xiaolong looked at Di Jun laughing with barely concealed killing intent on his Nine Dragon Throne. A solemn expression appeared on his face, and he said, “In fact, I do think that the two subordinates behind me will be able to protect me.”

Everyone stared at him in shock.

Even the ancestors from various Emperor Palaces who had lived for billions of years stared at Huang Xiaolong as though they were looking at a fool.

“Huang Xiaolong is too arrogant! He thinks he’s the king of the world! Even though the beasts behind him possess incredible strength, they are merely existences at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. Does he think that they are existences surpassing the Emperor Realm?! How dare he think that he can go against the Heavenly Court with the two monsters of his?”

“This time, I’m afraid that even the president of the Silver Fox Commerce won’t be able to protect him. He crossed the Heavenly Court’s bottom line. There is no way the Heavenly Emperor will let him off!”

Han Qing, Gudu Wuyi, Chen Jianwei, and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong, and they reveled in his misfortune.

Di Jun’s aura grew stronger and stronger, and a terrifying wave of energy shot out from his body. The skies changed color, and countless thunderclouds gathered in the sky. Deafening roars of thunder rang down on the world.

Under the suppression of Heavenly Emperor Di Jun, even the supreme experts standing on the Terrace of Heaven were suppressed.

“Has he surpassed the Emperor Realm?!”

The might he emitted was absolutely something only existences surpassing the Emperor Realm would possess.

“The Heavenly Emperor has broken through the limits of the Emperor Realm! He’s the supreme expert of his generation!”

Many ancestors cheered in celebration.

He was an existence surpassing the Emperor Realm!

It was the peak of strength in the Divine World. No, it signified that he stood at the peak of countless worlds.

The moment an existence like that appeared, no one would be able to stand against him!

No one would ever be able to challenge his prestige!

The aura he emitted could no longer be called Emperor’s might. Instead, it was closer to something of a ruler who dominated the world! He was emitting Ruler’s might!

Everyone kneeled and paid their respects to Heavenly Emperor Di Jun.

None of them could stand against him!

However, there were three people left standing on the plaza.

Without question, they were Huang Xiaolong and the two odd beasts behind him.

The two odd beasts stood their ground like an ethereal mountain. Nothing could shake them, and horrifying amounts of black light emerged from their bodies. Terrifying waves of darkness energy surged towards Heavenly Emperor Di Jun. This energy seemed to possess sentiment of its own as they protected Huang Xiaolong from Di Jun’s Ruler’s might.

As for Huang Xiaolong, rays of resplendent light emerged from his body, and from far, one would think that Huang Xiaolong was the incarnation of the primordial god of light. No matter what happened, even if the world collapsed and the heavens crumbled, Huang Xiaolong would still stand tall.

“How... How is this possible?!”

Everyone stared at the two monsters behind Huang Xiaolong, and a look of amazement appeared on their face.

Even Heavenly Emperor Di Jun was stunned.

Those two monsters serving Huang Xiaolong were actually able to resist the pressure he emitted?! It was indeed a shocking fact. Huang Xiaolong was a mere Heavenly Monarch, but even someone like him managed to withstand his Ruler’s might... What in the world was going on?!

How can Huang Xiaolong not bow down to him?!

Huang Xiaolong saw the changes in Di Jun’s face, and he laughed in his heart. So what if Di Jun has surpassed the Emperor Realm? It was basically impossible for him, the King of Hell, to bow down to anyone! His might and prestige as the King of Hell wasn’t something a mere Di Jun could stand up to, regardless of his strength as someone who had surpassed the Emperor Realm.

There wasn’t even a need to bring up the inheritance of the Heavenly Hall. If he wanted to, Huang Xiaolong could block off the pressure coming from Di Jun by just bringing it out. He hadn’t even bothered circulating his Heart of Hell either.

When Di Jun saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t bowing down to him, unbridled killing intent rose in his heart. His anger seemed to turn corporeal as it crashed towards Huang Xiaolong.

Even an Emperor wouldn’t be able to stand up to him!!!

Despite that, the light surrounding Huang Xiaolong merely increased a little.

In the end, the two monsters no longer concealed themselves under the constant pressure of Di Jun’s Ruler’s might. They roared towards the sky, and blacklight covered the area. It was as though a dark sun was formed.

They started to transform...

Everyone looked at how the beasts’ bodies were expanding, and they turned into giants thousands of feet tall. The tyrannical aura they emitted surged without end, and darkness filled the area.

As soon as they completed their transformation, their strength rose by ten folds.

Everyone felt as though their tongue was caught in their mouth.

“This... What in the world is going on?!” Gudu Wuyi screamed in shock.

Even Yan Tianchen and Xiao Yi from the Heavenly Court felt their blood run cold.

Previously, the beasts behind Huang Xiaolong had suppressed Xiao Yi and the rest on their own. That was before their transformation. Right now, they didn’t know if they could even take a single blow from one of the beasts!

This... FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

How did experts of their calibre submit to Huang Xiaolong?!

Even Di Jun swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock. Even someone like him wouldn’t be able to subdue those beasts. How did Huang Xiaolong do it?!

Di Jun stared at the beasts in shock and the more he looked at them, the clearer a terrifying thought in his mind became.

“Could it be?!” His face changed, and an unsightly expression appeared.

No one had recognized the beasts behind Huang Xiaolong when they were in disguise. People who weren’t too familiar with the beasts couldn’t guess their origins, but things were different the moment they transformed. Chen Wenqian and other Emperor Realm experts of his seniority guessed the beasts’ identities the moment they transformed.

There were even some Emperors whose hearts nearly stopped right there and then.

Even Elder Fu from the Silver Fox Commerce felt cold sweat drenching his back.

“It’s them!” Elder Fu exclaimed in surprise.

“Elder Fu, where did those beasts come from?” Bei Xiaomei noticed the pale-faced Elder Fu, and she couldn’t hold her curiosity back.

Elder Fu opened his mouth, but no words came out. However, he eventually managed to gather his thoughts, and explained, “Go ask Young Master Huang next time...” The identities of the beasts were something so sacred that even he wasn’t sure if he could talk about them.

Bei Xiaomei’s mouth formed a cute little pout, and she decided to pester Huang Xiaolong until he spilled all his secrets.

Just as everyone was fixed in a state of shock, Di Jun’s voice echoed through the air. “Emperor Father, Huang Xiaolong has violated the rules of the Heavenly Court. Your son is incapable and can only allow him to do as he wishes! Please personally make a move to reinforce the rules of the Heavenly Court! Kill Huang Xiaolong right now!”

Everyone felt an explosion going off in their brain.

Huang Xiaolong simply sniggered to himself as he immediately recognized Di Jun’s intent.

Di Jun suddenly relaxed and nodded his head. “Yes, I shall follow your command!” He withdrew his aura, and everyone felt their bodies turning lighter.

Di Jing rose to his feet suddenly and stared at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, do you dare to accept my challenge of life and death? No one is allowed to interfere!”
