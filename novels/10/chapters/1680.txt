The Nethersea was Asura World’s largest sea, and also Hell’s three worlds largest sea.

The Nethersea was not located on any plane, but it floated in the vast space above Asura World, which was an independent space in itself. Sometimes, Asura World’s experts would call the Nethersea as Nethersea Plane.

Of course, the majority simply calls it the Nethersea.

It was two days later when Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Nethersea.

In truth, half a day was sufficient for the Netherking Flying Ship to reach the Nethersea, but Huang Xiaolong’s group did not use the Netherking Flying Ship.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Nethersea, there was already a large crowd there. Both above the Nethersea and by the seaside, there were people everywhere, their numbers exceeding in billions.

Rows of flying ships from Hell’s various forces were halted in midair. These ships were enshrouded in individual halos.

These flying ships came in different shapes and sizes, some even as big as mountains. But above the Nethersea, these flying ships were only a little bigger than dust.

The Nethersea was simply too large. As Hell’s three worlds’ largest sea, it was bigger than most big planes. The Nirvana Plane was Asura World’s biggest plane, however, the Nethersea’s surface was at least twice the size of Nirvana Plane.

From afar, the Nethersea’s calm surface was akin to a blue mirror.

But hidden in the depths of this Nethersea, Huang Xiaolong sensed a surging energy that made his heart palpitate.

After the heart of hell had integrated into his body, as long as he was in Hell, even a high-level Emperor God Realm expert was incapable of killing him, but that energy from the depths of the Nethersea actually gave him a sense of mortal danger.

Does this energy have anything to do with the Holy Mountain that is about to appear?

“Master, shall we head to the center of the Nethersea now?” Tai Yue inquired.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Yes.”

Every time the Holy Mountain appears, it flies out from the central depths of the Nethersea. Therefore, getting as close as possible to where the Holy Mountain appears brings a greater advantage to ascending the Holy Mountain.

Huang Xiaolong’s group swiftly made their way closer to the central area.

There was still half a day until the appearance of the Holy Mountain was estimated. So, they had enough time to reach the central area of the sea.

However, the space above the Nethersea was crowded with people and flying ships. It was not easy to maneuver past them to reach a suitable location. In this situation, Huang Xiaolong did not order Tai Yue or the others to open a path, but released the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin from the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle.

The moment the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin appeared, it let out a rumbling roar, akin to brewing thunder. Experts within several million li radius felt their heads spin with a never ending buzzing noise in their ears.

“Oh God, that’s a Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin!”

“The one from the auction!”

Although the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin merely roared, those blocking Huang Xiaolong’s group path in front were startled, then swiftly retreated to the sides, opening a wide berth.

Even though the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin was merely a mid-Fourth Order Emperor God Realm on the surface, as one of the royal blood qilin most Fifth Order Emperor Realm experts were not a match against him.

In truth, not only Fifth Order Emperor Realm experts, even some Sixth Order Emperor Realm experts didn’t dare to say with confidence that they could suppress this Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

Huang Xiaolong leaped onto the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin’s back, and flew past everyone. Tai Yue and the others followed after him.

“Did that Asura noble tame this Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin?!”

“Did he? It’s barely three months! The Dark Roc Race couldn’t tame it even after tens of millennia!”

Everyone was dumbfounded as they watched the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin docilely allowing Huang Xiaolong to sit on his back, their eyes widened in incredulity, but even more than that there was jealousy and curiosity.

That was the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin ah! There was an old legend that said only a true king could tame a grandmist divine beast like the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the complicated gazes and whispers from the surrounding experts as he sped forward on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, leaving several afterimages of burning qilin hoof prints in the air.

After Huang Xiaolong released the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin and started moving towards the center area of the Nethersea, Song Litao who was closest to the central area received a report of the incident from his subordinate.

“Young Lord, that punk has appeared, and he’s coming this way, but...” One of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors said to Song Litao.

“But...?” Song Litao was baffled.

“The people below reported that he’s riding on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.” The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor replied.

“You’re saying?!” Song Litao was filled with disbelief. “You’re saying that that punk has already tamed the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin? Impossible!”

The Gu Family, Black Ant Clan, and Howling Moon Wolf’s experts all had similar incredulous expressions on their faces.

“That, but this is what the disciple below has reported. Even this subordinate feels it is unbelievable.” The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor hesitated.

Song Litao’s face darkened after hearing that. It was greatly unexpected to him that Huang Xiaolong had succeeded in taming the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

“I didn’t expect that that punk would actually manage to tame the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin within three months!” The Gu Family’s Patriarch Gu Chen frowned deeply, but his tone took a turn as he went on, “But so what? Even if he succeeded in taming that Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, that beast is just a mid-Fourth Order Emperor Realm, whether there is one qilin more or one qilin less cannot change the fact that he’s going to die soon!”

“That’s right, when our three forces’ experts from the headquarters arrive, he’s dead for sure! This Nethersea would be his burial place!” The Black Ant Clan’s Ancestor sneered coldly.

“Pity, a good Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin mount would be wasted just like that!” Song Litao sighed with great reluctance.

Even though there was a chance he could tame the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin after killing Huang Xiaolong, it was a very slim chance. A grandmist divine beast like the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin generally did not accept a second master, moreover, because of a qilin’s protective nature towards his master, a qilin would rather self-destruct.

“Damn, damn him! What method did that punk use to tame that Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin!” The more Song Litao thought about it, the angrier he felt.

Moments later, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Shi Yinyu, Ghost World’s Qin Huangzong, and other forces also received a report that Huang Xiaolong had successfully tamed the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. Each had a different reaction, but the disbelief and astonishment were similar.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know these people’s thoughts, then again, he wouldn’t care even if he knew. At this time, he was making his way towards the center area of the Nethersea on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. As expected of a grandmist divine beast, the qilin’s speed was amazing. Moreover, despite the qilin’s speed, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hear or feel any strong winds at all.

“Tai Yue, tell me in detail what do I need to pay attention to when ascending the Holy Mountain.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Tai Yue and the other three.

“Yes, Master. The Holy Mountain has a total of twelve floors; the first three people who clear each floor would be rewarded with a spiritual fruit called the holy fruit.” As they continued to fly forward, Tai Yue began to explain to Huang Xiaolong. “So, Master must strive to clear the obstacles on each floor in the shortest time. For each floor, the person who clears the obstacles first will be rewarded with three holy fruits, the second person will get two holy fruits, and the third person will get one holy fruit.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Oh, holy fruit?” Huang Xiaolong’s heart moved. “What are the attributes of the holy fruit?”

Jin Yuan replied, “Many times better than the top-grade grandmist spiritual pills. The old master had once mentioned that the King of Grandmist has a Grandmist Tree that bears grandmist fruits, and the holy fruit is as good as the grandmist fruit.”
