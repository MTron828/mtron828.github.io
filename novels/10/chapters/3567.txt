Chapter 3568 – How Can You Be Stronger Than The Star Dragon Couple?!

“What?! Huang Xiaolong?!”

Yu Long, Xu Long, and the others were shocked.

Huang Xiaolong’s status as the Star Dragon Couple’s sworn brother was no longer a secret in the Star Dragon Universe.

“Did anyone else come with him?!” Yu Long panicked.

“No. He came alone.”

Yu Long heaved a sigh of relief silently. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

A light flashed in Xu Long’s eyes. When Huang Xiaolong relied on the Star Dragon Couple’s backing to capture Chu Huaihao in front of him, he was greatly embarrassed. The incident was still stinging his pride after all these years.

“Go. Bring him here.” Yu Long ordered the expert who made the report.

“Yes, Lord Director!”

Before the man could leave the hall, a voice echoed in their ears. “There’s no need for the trouble. I’m here.”

Everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong who was sauntering into the hall.

A frown formed on Yu Long’s face and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong, your position in the Submerged Dragon Institute has already been stripped! How dare you come back?!”

“Do you really think that I won’t dare to do anything to you because of the Star Dragon Couple?!”

Yu Long’s voice rang through the Submerged Dragon Institute.

Huang Xiaolong ignored Yu Long as he swept his gaze across everyone in the hall. Huang Xiaolong saw Xu Long, Ao Wen, and other people he was familiar with. When he entered the Submerged Dragon Institute to look for the Star Dragon Essence, Ao Wen provided him with the news.

Ao Wen lowered her head as she was too ashamed to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Yu Long’s expression sank when he noticed how Huang Xiaolong ignored him.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re going too far!” Yu Long roared as he shattered the table beside him.

Huang Xiaolong took a single step and appeared in the plaza outside the grand hall. “Yu Long, stop yelling like a dead dog. I’ll give you a chance to fight me!”

Everyone in the Submerged Dragon Institute was shocked.

Yu Long stared at Huang Xiaolong while questioning what he just heard. “Huang Xiaolong, did I hear that right?! Are you f*cking crazy?! Do you really think that you’re as strong as the Star Dragon Couple?!”

One of the Gods of Creation at the grand completion stage in the Submerged Dragon Institute could no longer control his rage and he leaped to his feet. “Huang Xiaolong, even if the Star Dragon Couple comes today, I’ll teach you a lesson or two! Who the f*ck do you think you are?!”

They wanted to teach Huang Xiaolong some manners!

As soon as he spoke, he flew towards Huang Xiaolong. “Get down here right now! Get to your knees and apologize to Lord Yu Long!”

A God of Creation at the grand completion stage was horrifyingly strong! The faces of those present changed, and the experts of the various factions fell to their knees.

Just as everything thought that Huang Xiaolong would be beaten to the ground by the God of Creation, he casually waved his hand to nullify the attack coming his way. The God of Creation at the grand completion stage coughed a mouthful of blood. He was sent flying into the crowd and he crashed straight into Ao Wen of the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire!

Ao Wen failed to react in time and the blood of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage stained his body. Despite his status as a celestial emperor, he nearly fell to his knees in fright.

The experts of the various celestial empires were paralysed with shock.

They weren’t the only ones. Yu Long, Xu Long, and the various Gods of Creation present couldn’t believe their eyes.

After Huang Xiaolong’s disappearance, many people had been trying to guess how strong he had gotten. There were some who said that Huang Xiaolong entered the God of Creation Realm and he reached the small completion stage. Others said that he might have entered the large completion stage! A minority of them thought that Huang Xiaolong reached the grand completion stage!

No one expected him to reach the peak of the grand completion stage!

From what they saw, he wasn’t any weaker than Yu Long or Xu Long! Even if he hadn’t reached their level, he wasn’t too far off!

Huang Xiaolong ignored the God of Creation who was sent flying and he turned to Yu Long, “Yu Long, get up here. As the director of the Submerged Dragon Institute, you should behave like one. You can’t let your subordinate die on your behalf.”

“Of course, it doesn’t matter if you come up here or not. The outcome of the battle is already decided.”

His voice stabbed the dao souls of those present.

Intentionally or unintentionally, the gazes of those present drifted to Yu Long.

Reaching the limit of his patience, Yu Long roared with laughter as killing intent spewed from his eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, you’re too arrogant! I’ll show you the end of someone who doesn’t know his place!”

“Even if I offend the Star Dragon Couple, I’ll teach you a lesson!”

As soon as the words left his lips, he charged at Huang Xiaolong. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s palm emerged from the void beside him and slapped him senseless. Yu Long was sent flying as he crashed into the body of the first expert who moved against Huang Xiaolong.

Silence descended on the lands as everyone looked at Yu Long who was defeated by a single slap!

Blood trickled down Yu Long’s cheeks as his teeth scattered across the floor.

As for Ao Wen, he could no longer control himself as he fell to the ground and a wet patch stained his pants.

“Was that what you wanted to teach me?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

Yu Long crawled to his feet as he suppressed the humiliation he felt. With fright filling his mind, he cried, “This… This isn’t possible! How are you stronger than the Star Dragon Couple?! This isn't possible!”

If Huang Xiaolong was stronger than them, why would he need them to capture Chu Huaihao?!

Yu Long was stuck in a state of disbelief and so was Xu Long. No one could believe that someone would be stronger than the Star Dragon Couple!

“That’s because you don’t know how vast the universe is!” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

With a sudden roar, golden light emerged from Yu Long’s body. It illuminated the various spaces in the Submerged Dragon Institute and a staff appeared in his hand.

The Dragon Staff was a top-grade creation artifact, and it was created from the most precious treasures in the Star Dragon Universe. There wasn’t a need to mention how strong it was!

Unfortunately for him, his opponent was Huang Xiaolong. With a simple wave of his hand, he blocked the Dragon Staff that was crashing down on him.

Huang Xiaolong casually flicked his wrist and sent Yu Long flying out once again.
