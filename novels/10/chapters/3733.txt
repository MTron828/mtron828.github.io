Chapter 3734: Location of the Black Nether King

 

Even though he broke through, Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to emerge from seclusion. He continued to comprehend the secrets behind the mirror as he devoured whatever universe source qi was in the formation.

It didn’t take long before the day arrived. It was the day the Universe First Race would activate the Extermination Formation!

Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover that there wasn’t any movement from the Universe First Race!

As soon as he emerged from the Universe Boat, he summoned the White Deer.

“Did Huang Ren and the others do anything out of the ordinary lately?” 

“Nope.” The White Deer shook its head. “Old Man Fortune hasn’t come back either. I asked many experts in the Fortune Space, and all of them said that Old Man Fortune went out to look for a fortuitous encounter to break through to the Universe God Realm. He went to a faraway land, but no one knows where that is.”

“Faraway land?” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “What about the Universe First Race?” 

“They have remained quiet in recent years.” The White Deer shook its head. “We can only be sure that the Black Nether King isn’t currently in the Universe Vault!”

Light sparkled in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

It definitely wasn’t a coincidence that Old Man Fortune and the Black Nether King went missing at the same time.

According to the conversation between Heaven Tyrant and the Star Refinement King, the Extermination Formation should have been activated! However, nothing happened so far, and the Black Nether King was nowhere to be found! There had to be something going on!

Moreover, the Universe First Race was being too low profile and Huang Xiaolong felt that something was off.

Retrieving his transmission symbol, Huang Xiaolong contacted the Blood Phoenix Queen and Titan King. He soon received a reply. The Black Nether King hasn’t started the Extermination Formation and no one knows where he went.

However, they said that Heaven Tyrant might have a clue as to where the Black Nether King went.

“Heaven Tyrant…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

Huang Xiaolong asked them about the Heaven Tyrant’s whereabouts.

After learning that Heaven Tyrant was staying around the Star Refinement King recently, Huang Xiaolong decided to return to the Universe Vault.

“Entering the Universe Vault?!” The White Deer gasped.

“That’s right. We’re leaving in a bit.”

Now, Huang Xiaolong wanted nothing more than to know the Black Nether King’s whereabouts.

Since he entered the half-step Universe God Realm, he was no longer afraid of the Black Nether King. He wanted to figure out what the Black Nether King planned to do exactly. After all, Huang Xiaolong felt that the Black Nether King had always been acting a little weirdly. 

“We’re leaving in a bit?!” The White Deer yelled. It had no idea what the rush was.

“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He didn’t explain too much to the White Deer and quickly looked for Yang Dingsheng. Handing over countless pills and top-grade universe-level spiritual veins, Huang Xiaolong bade his farewell and left for the Universe Vault.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong brought out the Universe Boat.

Even so, it took him an entire year to arrive. When he entered the Universe Vault, he didn’t waste a second as he went straight for the Star Refinement King’s palace.

After several months, Huang Xiaolong arrived.

He used his dao souls to scout his surroundings and discovered that Heaven Tyrant was really hiding in the Star Refinement King’s palace.

The Star Refinement King, Golden Cymbals King, Heaven Devouring King, and the Golden Qilin King were all present!

Other than the White Feather King, every expert in the Universe Vault who crossed the 27 billion mark had arrived!

Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of excitement filling his heart.

Since they were all present, he would take care of all of them at once!

If he hadn’t broken through, he couldn’t be sure that he had the ability to suppress all of them at once. Now, he was absolutely certain that he could take them all down.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

With a wave of his arm, the Star Dragon Divine Tree filled the skies and locked down the entire area.

When he was done, Huang Xiaolong kept the Universe Boat away. He emerged with the White Deer.

“Who?!” The moment they revealed themselves, the Star Refinement King and the others were alerted.

Charging out of the palace instantly, they were shocked to discover Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” The Golden Cymbals King and Heaven Devouring King yelled in unison.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” The Star Refinement King scoffed, “Are you really Huang Xiaolong?!” 

However, his expression changed slightly when he saw the White Deer. “Are you the master of the White Deer Cave?!” 

He had sealed off the White Deer Cave in the past along with the White Feather King, and he was extremely familiar with the White Deer.

Everyone else looked at the White Deer in fright.

“Star Refinement King, are you surprised to see me?” The White Deer sneered. It looked at the palace behind them and chuckled, “That’s a nice palace. Looks like you really know how to enjoy life…”

The Golden Cymbals King shattered a transmission symbol but it was stopped by a wave of starlight. The faces of the various kings changed.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you intrude into our Universe Vault? You’re asking to die!” The Star Refinement King snorted, “Do you really think that you can stop the five of us with just your Star Dragon Divine Tree?” 

“I can try.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

A fan that emitted faint starlight appeared in the Star Refinement King’s hand, and he swung it towards Huang Xiaolong. A torrent of energy surged towards Huang Xiaolong.

The Star Fan was one of the thirteen universe treasures.

Remaining completely calm, Huang Xiaolong reached out a single arm to stop the energy wave.

The faces of everyone changed.

The White Feather King revealed Huang Xiaolong’s strength after returning from the White Deer Cave. Many of them were doubtful of his claims, but now, it seemed as though everything he said was true!

The Heaven Devouring King, Golden Qilin King, and Golden Cymbals King flew into the skies in unison. There were countless black swords flying towards Huang Xiaolong and the Golden Qilin King revealed his true form. Turning into a giant qilin, a golden beam shot towards Huang Xiaolong from its mouth.

As for the Golden Cymbals King, he tossed out his golden cloth once again as a golden rain fell upon the lands.

All of them went all out instantly.

Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive as he sent a slap flying towards the three of them.
