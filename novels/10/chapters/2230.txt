Chapter 2231: Why Are You Rushing to Get Yourself Killed?

Song Shaokang and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong when they heard what he said. In the next instant, everyone broke out into rambunctious laughter, and Song Shaokang’s sneer filled the air.

“Brat, I’ve seen too many arrogant b*stards in my time. However, you’re the most arrogant fool I’ve come across! Do you really think that you have the ability to kill me with your Ninth Order Sovereign Realm cultivation?!”

The aura around him started to swell as he roared, “Do you even know how strong I am?! I’m a mid-Tenth Order Sovereign! I have heavily injured late-Tenth Order Sovereigns before!”

“Even a late-Tenth Order Sovereign won’t be able to defeat me. Who do you think you are?!”

Killing intent surged out from Song Shaokang’s eyes the moment he spoke.

It was humiliating to think that a Ninth Order Sovereign would even think of killing him!

Zhang Wenyue and the others had no idea how strong Huang Xiaolong was. They were only able to make an approximate guess. When they heard that Huang Xiaolong was a Ninth Order Sovereign and Song Shaokang was a Tenth Order Sovereign, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of uneasiness in their hearts.

“Young Master, should we...?” Zhang Wenyue stared at Huang Xiaolong with a worried expression on her face as she whispered softly.

She wanted to persuade Huang Xiaolong to leave while Song Shaokang was preoccupied with the lighting qi restrictions around the Lightning Dragon Divine Tree.

Even a baby would know that a Ninth Order Sovereign would be no match for a Tenth Order Sovereign! Not to mention that Huang Xiaolong was currently injured, and he was only at the early-Ninth Order Sovereign Realm at his peak! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Before Huang Xiaolong could say a word, Song Shaokang’s figure flashed and appeared before them. “Do you really think that you can leave so easily? Isn’t it too late for regrets now?”

He released his aura and completely locked on to Huang Xiaolong and the others.

At the same time, he ordered the two old experts who followed him around. “Hurry up and destroy the restrictions around the tree! I’ll deal with this brat alone!”

“Yes, Young Lord!”

It was clear that they didn’t doubt Song Shaokang’s strength in the slightest.

Song Shaokang turned around and his gaze landed on Zhang Wenyue. “Lady Zhang, if you agree to submit to me right now, I won’t kill you. After you hand over the Treasure Tome, I’ll allow you to return to the Beast Emperor Sect with me to become a core disciple!”

“I’ll even introduce you to several Eminent Elders in the sect and make one of them accept you as a personal disciple!”

“You’ll become a phoenix that soars high above the rest! You’ll be able to attain endless glory!”

Song Shaokang’s alluring voice entered Zhang Wenyue’s ears in an attempt to bring her over to his side.

Even though the Beast Emperor Sect wasn’t stronger than the Big Dipper Sword Sect, the Beast Emperor Sect was only second to the three supreme sects in the Falling Jade Dynasty! If she could become a personal disciple of a Eminent Elder in the Beast Emperor Sect, her position in the dynasty would soar! Even the emperor of the Jinyuan Kingdom would need to lower his head around her!

As a personal disciple of a Eminent Elder of the Beast Emperor Sect, her position would definitely be higher than a normal disciple in the Big Dipper Sword Sect anyway!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t utter a word as he awaited Zhang Wenyue’s reply.

The reason he hadn’t placed restrictions in her body was because he wanted to see the choice she would make when faced with temptations from others.

Zhang Wenyue looked at Song Shaokang and shook her head. “I will not submit to the Beast Emperor Sect, and I will never betray Young Master Huang!” Even though she didn’t say much, her words slammed heavily into Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

“Since that is the case, I’ll kill this brat before r*ping you till you die from exhaustion!”

A sinister smile formed on Song Shaokang’s lips.

“Are you done?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air as he had already obtained his answer.

“What? Are you really eager to die?!” Song Shaokang chuckled coldly. “If that’s the case, I’ll deal with you now!”

He waved both his arms and a massive beast appeared beside him.

The vicious beast that appeared was one that was nurtured by Song Shaokang since he started cultivating. It was a grandmist level spiritual beast, and it was called the Scarlet Blood Black Tiger!

Its body was pitch back in color, but there was a bloody glow surrounding its body.

“I won’t even need to make a move to kill someone like you. My mount will be enough to send you to hell!” Song Shaokang waved his hand and ordered, “Go. Tear this brat apart!”

The Scarlet Blood Black Tiger was an early-Tenth Order Sovereign Realm beast, and when it heard Song Shaokang’s order, it leaped towards Huang Xiaolong with no hesitation.

When it swiped its claws through the space, countless rays of terrifying light emerged from the void.

“Young Master Huang, be careful!” Zhang Wenyue yelled in shock.

As though he hadn’t seen the strength of the beast, Huang Xiaolong punched out with both fists.

When Song Shaokang saw what Huang Xiaolong did, a sneer formed on his face. “Brat, you’re really tired of living... My Scarlet Blood Black Tiger can shred top-grade grandmist artifacts with its claws!”

The Scarlet Blood Black Tiger was famed for its speed, but its claws were equally as sharp!

As soon as the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong’s fist slammed into the beast’s claws. Sounds of shattering bones filled the air as the Scarlet Blood Black Tiger’s claws turned into pieces of flesh that flew all around. A miserable shriek rang through the air, and the tiger slammed into the sea under them.

“Boom!”

A pillar of water erupted from the surface of the ocean when the tiger slammed into it.

Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and Prince Qian felt their eyeballs popping out from their sockets when they stared at the sudden change in situation.

Song Shaokang felt his world spinning when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

When the two old experts from the Beast Emperor Sect heard the tiger’s wail, they couldn’t help but turn their attention back to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother looking at the Scarlet Blood Black Tiger. He turned to Song Shaokang and muttered, “It seems like your mount won’t be enough. I think you should make your move.”

The two old experts no longer dared to leave their Young Lord alone as they quickly arrived beside him. They glared at Huang Xiaolong with a wary expression and they called out their beasts.

Even if they were the ones facing Song Shaokang’s Scarlet Blood Black Tiger, they wouldn’t be able to kill it easily! However, Huang Xiaolong had sent it to the brink of death with a single punch!

“Who are you?!” Song Shaokang stared at Huang Xiaolong with an ugly expression. He could feel that his Scarlet Blood Black Tiger was on the brink of death, and rage bubbled in his heart. God knew how many divine pills it had eaten to become an early-Tenth Order Sovereign Realm beast!

Without the slightest bit of resistance, it was smashed into a pulp by Huang Xiaolong!

“My identity isn’t important.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head before continuing, “I’ve said this before. It’s a shame you won’t be able to obtain the Lightning Dragon Divine Fruit. You know what’s worse? You’ll be leaving your life behind too!”

Song Shaokang’s expression fell even further when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

When Huang Xiaolong had spoken of his intentions previously, Song Shaokang had not taken it to heart. However, it seemed like that was the wrong thing to do.

“Brat, do you really think you have won?” A frosty light flashed through Song Shaokang’s eyes. The glow around his body became a little brighter as a piece of divine armor appeared around him. A massive blade appeared in his arm and there were carvings of countless beasts on the surface of the blade.

“Beast Emperor Blade!” Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes when he saw the weapon Song Shaokang brought out.

The Beast Emperor Blade was one of the most treasured possessions of the sect. It was a supreme spiritual treasure, and even though it was only a low-grade supreme spiritual treasure, it was stronger than most ordinary supreme spiritual treasures.

The divine armor around Song Shaokang’s body wasn’t an ordinary top-grade grandmist artifact. It was exceptionally strong and its defensive properties far surpassed other top-grade grandmist artifacts!

“That’s right! This is the Beast Emperor Blade!” Song Shaokang scoffed, “Even late-Tenth Order Sovereigns won’t be able to break my armor! I refuse to believe that I won’t be able to kill a mere Ninth Order Sovereign like yourself with my Beast Emperor Blade!”
