Chapter 2836: Setting Out On A Journey Soon

Hearing the screams coming from the Immemorial Grand Array, a sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips.

Yan San, who had been suppressed by the array, had been slamming against it for ten years. His hair was in a mess and his eyes were bloodshot. He was nothing more than a madman at that moment.

He couldn’t escape, and he couldn’t withstand the immemorial sword qi that came from the array. His life had been a living hell.

Even though the Immemorial Sword Qi could not destroy his physical body, it had the power to slice into his dao soul.

Huang Xiaolong’s indifference angered Yan San even further and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong, I will kill you and rip you apart piece by piece the moment I leave!”

“I’ve heard this so many times from so many people, but unfortunately for all of them, I’m still alive. Don’t even dream of escaping. I’m going to kill you and refine your cosmos energy soon.” A glint flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Yan San was stunned, but he started to howl with laughter, “You, killing me? Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you can kill me?! Who do you think you are?! A God of Creation?!”

A Dao Venerable was supposed to be indestructible. Only a God of Creation would be able to actually slay a Dao Venerable.

As for the type of restrictions, only the strongest creation level restriction would be able to kill a Dao Venerable!

When Yan San heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted to kill him, he sneered inwardly.

Naturally, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about the man. Other people might be unable to kill Dao Venerables, but he was different. After breaking through to the Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm and crossing the fourth tribulation, his cosmos energy took a huge leap forward.

If that were to continue, the small world in his body might transform into a great world when he entered the Dao Venerable Realm! He would be at the same level as a God of Creation!

The moment he formed a great world, killing Dao Venerables would be nothing difficult!

Of course, he wouldn’t bother explaining himself to Yan San.

“Huang Xiaolong, if you let me go now, I will swear an oath to never look for you again! You can’t trap me in here forever anyway! Using the Immemorial Grand Formation to trap me here will drain a huge amount of your spiritual energy. You won’t be able to kill me anyway! You’re going to lose a lot if you choose to do this!” Yan San attempted to arouse his sympathy.

“I’ll agree to any conditions you have, and I can serve you for ten thousand years!” Yan San continued.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent.

The condition was indeed a little tempting. After all, gaining a Dao Venerable Realm subordinate for ten thousand years was pretty great.

Even so, an oath might not be able to restrict Yan San. Dao Venerables could use the cosmos energy in their bodies to expel the oath formed with his blood essence.

As such, there was no way Huang Xiaolong would trust Yan San to do as he said.

It was true that he would use a ton of spiritual energy to keep Yan San trapped in the formation, but due to his Huang Long Bloodline, spiritual energy had never been an issue.

Yan San was enraged to see Huang Xiaolong’s reaction and he rained curses on all eighteen generations of his ancestors.

When Yan San was in the midst of his scolding, Huang Xiaolong sent a punch towards his chest as the power of nirvana swallowed Yan San.

A blood-curdling screech left his lips.

After crossing the fourth tribulation, Huang Xiaolong’s power of nirvana grew much stronger than before.

Before Huang Xiaolong broke through, Yan San was like a little ant in front of him. One could only imagine how much more painful it was now.

After he was blasted away, Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of Yan San and sent another punch flying to his chest.

Every punch was filled with the power of nirvana, and Huang Xiaolong used his Huang Long Bloodline to torture Yan San. His screams could be heard in every corner of the Immemorial Immortal Cave, and the qilins’ hair stood on end.

Fortunately, the everyone had left the Immemorial Immortal Cave for the Cangqiong City. If they heard Yan San’s screams, they wouldn’t be able to sleep for days.

Huang Xiaolong tortured Yan San for several days, and he only stopped after that. Eventually, Yan San broke down in tears!

Yan San, a First Esteem Dao Venerable, a hall master of the Blue Heaven Creed and a supreme figure in the region was beaten up so badly he cried!

The Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin were dazed when they saw his tears.

They had followed the Immemorial Dao Venerable for countless years and that was the first time seeing a Dao Venerable tortured so badly he cried.

If the news were to spread, the entire Divine Tuo Holy World would tremble!

“Huang Xiaolong, I won’t do it anymore, please stop!” Yan San cried as he begged Huang Xiaolong to stop.

He begged while weeping.

How miserable would a Dao Venerable be if he had to beg a Primal Ancestor to stay his hand?

A few days later, Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Immemorial Immortal Cave with the fire and ice qilins.

As soon as they were out, they looked at him with a weird expression.

They were surrounded by Cangqiong Old Man, Fei Yanzi, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng the moment they appeared. Everyone started chatting happily about the changes to Cangqiong Sacred Land in the past years.

Huang Xiaolong had been in seclusion the entire time, but there were countless sacred lands coming over to join the Cangqiong Alliance. By the time he emerged, the Cangqiong Alliance was the number one power in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave! In fact, it was the strongest alliance in the surrounding regions!

There were eleven thousand Primal Ancestors in the alliance, and the number was terrifying! One had to know that there were only three thousand Primal Ancestors in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed the development of Cangqiong Sacred Land.

He was worried to leave them behind, but it seemed as though he could head over to the Dragon Fish Creed in peace.

But just to be cautious, he decided to warn Yi Beihang, Wang Jin, and He Yugui before he left.

“What, Xiaolong, are you really planning to head over to the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave?!” Cangqiong Old Man asked Huang Xiaolong as soon as the feast ended.

Fei Yanzi, Duan Feng, Fu Daosheng, and Zhou Hong were startled by the sudden decision.

“Xiaolong, I wish to come…” The moment Fei Yanzi spoke, Huang Xiaolong shook his head and cut her off, “I will only bring Long Jianfei and Duan Feng.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He knew that Fei Yanzi only wanted to stay by his side, but the Dragon Fish Creed was too dangerous. Looking for the Huang Long Armor was a massive risk, and it would be inconvenient for her to follow him around.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng were from the peak-level creeds before they left, and they would be the best guides.
