Merely a moment later, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s shock turned to delight. The more it thought about it, the more convinced he was that the icy blue and crimson red fires forming that barrier were two of the four great divine fires, the Black Tortoise Divine Fire and Vermilion Bird Divine Fire!

The Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head erupted in laughter, resounding in the gray space.

“Truly, the Heavens are favoring me!” The Hundred Spirits Beast King’s heard looked up, laughing with a touch of madness, “Little runt, those two fires on your body are the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires, correct? Only the four great divine fires can withstand my hundred spirits demonic qi. I didn’t expect ah, just as I wanted to break out from this seal, that I’d witness the legendary divine fires, moreover, two at the same time!”

“As long as I kill you and refine the two divine fires, I’d be able to regain my peak strength, even surpass my past self! Who other than me is capable of dominating the boundless galaxies?!”

“I, Hundred Spirits Beast King, am the world’s true hegemon!”

In the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s eyes, the young human in front of him was already a dead man.

The Hundred Spirits Beast King’s laughter sounded manic in Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

Although the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires were formidable, it still depended on who was controlling them. A mere God Realm cultivator was far from being a threat to it.

Huang Xiaolong calmed down as he focused on the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head on the altar. A soft light flashed around his hand and a Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellet appeared in his palm. Swallowing the pellet, he immediately initiated Instant Recovery to heal.

The injuries on his body recovered at an alarming speed.

“En? Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellet?!” In a single glance, the Hundred Spirits Beast King had recognized the medicinal pellet that Huang Xiaolong had just consumed as being the legendary Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellet.

“Hehe, little runt, it seems like you’ve quite a few good things on you. However, I want to see just how many of those divine pellets you have!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Hundred Spirits Beast King opened its mouth wide, letting out another bellow. This roar was earth-shattering.

Terrifying sound waves struck every inch of the gray space, covering everything in giant hurricanes. Up against this demonic qi hurricane, even the powerful bodies of the average early First Order Highgod Realm, and mid-First Order Highgod Realm masters would be shredded to pieces in a mere breath’s time.

A large number of giant demonic qi hurricanes spun toward Huang Xiaolong akin to sharp wind blades, about to shred the flesh off his bones. There was also that terrifying sound wave stabbing at his soul like invisible sharp needles.

The sound wave attack this time was even stronger than the first.

Huang Xiaolong’s face paled, but his true immortal essence force and Asura battle qi were coursing madly through his body, both the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires’ spirits flew out, each roaring to counter the assaulting sound wave.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air, his whole body spinning.

Frigid Asura qi gathered into a huge hurricane with his body as the eye of the hurricane, expanding more and more, turning into a dark black divine dragon.

This was a god level battle skill, Dragon Twirling Clouds.

Although the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head was more terrifying than he had expected, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t just stand still and do nothing.

In that split second, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s demonic qi hurricanes had closed in on Huang Xiaolong, colliding with his Dragon Twirling Clouds.

The gray space world intensely shook, as if it would shatter and crumble in the next moment

On the outside, the initially quiet Death God Lake’s water was now rising in great waves that reached a thousand zhang high, splattering everywhere after being affected by the shockwaves of Huang Xiaolong and the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s battle. Even the Death God Lake’s surroundings were shaking due to the powerful energy fluctuations.

It was fortunate that the Death God Lake was a forbidden land, devoid of humans, hence the intense battle here did not alert any natives of the Sea of Flowers World.

Inside the gray space, the Dragon Twirling Clouds’ wind flowing around the dark black divine dragon was continually abraded by the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s giant demonic qi hurricanes. When the last layer of wind was swept away, the remaining gray demonic qi hurricanes struck Huang Xiaolong.

Just like before, Huang Xiaolong was sent flying like a broken kite, crashing to the ground from high air, spurting blood. Again, like before, Huang Xiaolong got to his feet in no time, taking out and swallowing a Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellet. His Instant Recovery ability immediately replenished his battle qi.

“You, impossible!!” The Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head hollered. Despite his all-out attack, that young human was still able to stand up so quickly. Inwardly, it was astounded.

“Hundred Spirits Beast King, is this all the strength you can presently muster?” Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at the golden-haired monkey head on the altar, sneering, “If it is so, you won’t be able to kill me.”

Although he was the one who suffered injuries in both exchanges, heavy injuries at that, Huang Xiaolong was extremely calm at this moment.

Admittedly, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head was indeed powerful, but it would be hard pressed to kill Huang Xiaolong thanks to his Instant Recovery ability!

No matter how grave his injuries were, he was able to heal at a rapid speed. Not to mention the fact that he has several hundred bottles of Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets inside his Asura Ring, reaching up to ten thousand pellets.

With ten thousand Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets and his Instant Recovery ability, as long as the Hundred Spirits Beast King was unable to destroy his soul in one swift attack, then, as the battle dragged on, the one to die would definitely be the Hundred Spirits Beast King!

By now, Huang Xiaolong could clearly see that it was still restrained by the sealing formation. Thus, every time it attacked Huang Xiaolong, it expands a large amount of energy. At this rate, it wouldn’t be able to last very long.

At this time, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head let out a furious bellow. Light gathered in its scarlet eyes, growing brighter every second, then shot out at Huang Xiaolong.

Bloody waves flooded out. Two enormous rivers of blood drilled like pointed arrows toward Huang Xiaolong at a speed that did not allow him to dodge.

However, Huang Xiaolong was prepared this time.

He once again initiated his true immortal essence force and Asura battle qi, whereas the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires’ spirits emitted a blinding radiance of icy blue and crimson red, intertwining.

At the same time, a black armor appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s body. This black armor had blue glimmering symbols, forming layers of black-blue waves.

This black armor was the very same armor that the Saint Mother Yao Chi passed on to Huang Xiaolong before ascending to the Divine World, the Glory of the Water God.

Even Feng Yang, as the Black Warrior Institute Principal, was amazed by the defensive ability of this Glory of the Water God armor.

Right at this point, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s attack arrived.

The two blood rivers slammed into the black-blue water waves of the Glory of the Water God. The black-blue waves surged violently and separated, but the blood rivers continued to strike at the Asura Barrier.

Huang Xiaolong was knocked into the air again.

This time, he immediately bounced back to this feet, popping a Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellet into his mouth and initiated Instant Recovery, similar to the previous two times. But this time he did not cough up blood.

Watching this, the Hundred Spirits Beast King was enraged, attacking again.

The Hundred Spirits Beast King attacked many times, and Huang Xiaolong got back on his feet just as many times.

Just like this, the sun outside set for the night.

On the first day, every time the Hundred Spirits Beast King attacked, Huang Xiaolong would be knocked into the air, injured yet unable to retaliate even once.

On the second day, Huang Xiaolong was able to occasionally dodge the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s attacks.

On the third day, he managed to sneak in a few attacks of his own while dodging.

As days passed, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s energy consumption increased significantly. As it grew weaker, the altar’s sealing formation gained the advantage, whereas Huang Xiaolong grew stronger with every battle. Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong was able to fight to a draw against the Hundred Spirits Beast King.
