Chapter 3167: Tens of Thousands of Years Later

Seeing Huang Xiaolong enter seclusion once more, Lin Xiaoying, Fei Yanzi, Feng Yue, and Yin Yue were in a low mood.

After a while, Fei Yanzi’s eyes turned as an idea came to her, she smiled and asked Lin Xiaoying, “Sister, what techniques and grand dao arts Xiaolong has been teaching you at night these years? Can you talk about it with us sisters?”

Lin Xiaoying blushed until her ears, and she snorted at Fei Yanzi and reached out to tickle her in revenge, “Sister Yanzi, you’re so bad, asking something that you already know.”

Fei Yanzhi laughed as she jumped around to dodge Lin Xiaoying’s evil claws. “We really don’t know. Sister Feng Yue, Sister Yin Yue, do you know?”

Feng Yue and Yin Yue both shook their heads smilingly. “We know nothing.”

“Sister, just tell us, eh? What did Xiaolong teach you?” Fei Yanzi persisted as her laughter rang in the air.

The yard was filled with the four ladies’ laughter as they fool around.

“If you want to know, have Xiaolong teach you all when he exits seclusion!”

“We don’t want Xiaolong to teach us, we just want to hear you say it!”

Inside the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged under the Tree of Origin, absorbing the origin qi coming from the tree, and comprehending the various energies contained within the origin qi.

The Tree of Origin was the source of all forms of energies between heaven and earth. The origin qi not only contain the thirteen elements’ energies, but also many other forms of energies such as yin and yang energy, fortune energy, devil energy, karma, nefarious energy, death energy, and so forth.

Huang Xiaolong who was enshrouded in brilliant rays of myriad lights looked like jade that exuded ten thousand lusters from afar.

While comprehending the various energies within the origin qi, the three small worlds inside Huang Xiaolong’s body were going through rapid changes, enveloped in bright flickering lights. The surface of the three small worlds resembled Huang Xiaolong on the surface, enshrouded in a myriad of brilliant lights as if something amazing was going to break out.

As time passed, the three small worlds shone even brighter.

Several thousand years later, various manifestations appeared around Huang Xiaolong. There were golden dragons frolicking around him, archdevils battling, God of Death creating a ghost realm, great gods shaking heaven and earth, and auspicious beasts worshiping the heavens.

These manifestations that appeared around Huang Xiaolong flabbergasted Yuan Tianyi, and everyone inside the Sun Moon Furnace.

"Senior Tianyi, His Highness is…?" Cang Xun couldn’t resist asking.

There was an unfathomable look in Yuan Tianyi’s eyes as he pondered before he answered, “His Highness’ situation slightly resembles epiphany.”

“Epiphany!” Cang Xun, Di Shuang, and the others exclaimed softly, and the surprised expressions on their faces mirrored each other.

Yuan Tianyi nodded in affirmation. “That must be it. Once one enters a state, his comprehension towards the grand dao improves by leaps and bounds in a single day. It can be said in His Highness’ current state, and his progress in a year is greater than us comprehending grand dao for ten thousand years!”

“What?!” Cang Xun, Di Shuang, and the others exclaimed loudly this time.

“Then, if His Highness can maintain this state for a hundred years, doesn’t that equal to us cultivating for a million years?” Lei Yu exclaimed in disbelief.

Yuan Tianyi stated solemnly, “More or less so, but it’s hard to say if His Highness can maintain this state for a hundred years. Some lasted for several decades, some even less. Of course, there were also those that were in this state for several hundred years. I too have experienced a similar state once!”

Shocked gazes fell on Yuan Tianyi.

“But I could only remain in the state for several decades, and it was at that time that I comprehended the power of time!” Yuan Tianyi went on, “If it wasn’t for the epiphany that time, who knows how much longer I would have needed to comprehend the power of time.”

Everyone was envious.

Noticing the envious faces around him, Yuan Tianyi said, “Some people did not enter this kind of state in their lifetime, and not only it depended on one’s talent, but it also depended on their own chance.”

Worried they would somehow disturb Huang Xiaolong in this state, everyone stopped cultivating and sat in a protective circle around Huang Xiaolong.

Several thousand years passed.

The brilliant rays enshrouding Huang Xiaolong had intensified over the years, and the various magical manifestations around him had not dissipated in so many years. On top of that, the manifestations actually spread into a bigger area, forcing Yuan Tianyi and the others to move further away to the edge.

Even so, they were still affected by the sea of manifestations around Huang Xiaolong because they had filled the entire Sun Moon Furnace’s space.

Submerged by Huang Xiaolong’s manifestations, Yuan Tianyi, Cang Xun, Di Shuang, and the others trembled as they vaguely sensed a kind of ethereal energy entering their bodies.

This is!

Yuan Tianyi was the first to react, and he quickly closed his eyes and tried to comprehend this ethereal energy. Seeing this, Cang Xun, Di Shuang, and the others emulated Yuan Tianyi. All of them calmed down and sat cross-legged as they attempted to grasp the unfamiliar energy.

When Huang Xiaolong woke up from the epiphany state, it was thirty thousand years later. Huang Xiaolong had maintained that state for thirty thousand years!

Counting the seclusion time before he entered epiphany, his seclusion time had greatly exceeded thirty thousand years. All in all, since Huang Xiaolong returned to Cangqiong Holy World, he had spent more than forty thousand years in seclusion.

As Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes this time, there was a deeper understanding of the universe, and he had a new perspective towards the grand dao, and so was his understanding of all living creatures.

From the last seclusion, eleven of his absolute powers had reached perfection realm, and had peeked into the God of Creation Realm, but it was merely a peek. The feeling he had was extremely blurry but now, everything felt so clear!

In comparison, after the last seclusion, there was still the distance of one heavenly cave between him and the God of Creation Realm, whereas this time, the distance had shortened to within the same heavenly cave!

Huang Xiaolong had gained a lot from the seclusion this time. He now understood the various kinds of energies between heaven and earth, and he had higher mastery of use towards the thirteen elements of absolute powers, including integrating the thirteen elements. On top of that, the power of time and space had reached major completion, almost reaching the peak of major completion.

Unfortunately, just a little bit more. Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. If he could have maintained the epiphany state for several hundred thousand years, his power of time and space definitely could have reached perfection level!

Without the epiphany state, it would probably take him a hundred million years or more to achieve that, will it?!

At the latter stages, it was harder to advance the power of time and space, and the difficulty exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s estimation. Huang Xiaolong had thought with the Tree of Origin, both his power of time and space could reach perfection level with ten thousand years of seclusion, but who knew that after entering the epiphany state and cultivating for thirty thousand years, his power of time and space would merely reach major completion.

A hundred million years?

Huang Xiaolong’s head ached, thinking it might take a hundred million years for his power of time and space to reach perfection level.

A hundred million years. He couldn’t wait that long, and even if he could, Huang Rong wouldn’t, and the family behind him wouldn’t either.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong understood that some things couldn’t be rushed. Hence, he exited seclusion with Yuan Tianyi and the others.

After coming out of seclusion this time, Huang Xiaolong had no plans to enter another round of seclusion soon. He and the four ladies set out for another trip around Cangqiong Holy World while he waited for Shi Xiaofei, and his family to ascend. He wasn’t completely idle either, but he delved into the dao of formation.
