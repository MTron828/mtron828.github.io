Chapter 2727: Convent of the Wind and Clouds

Cangqiong Sacred Land? Wang Xueru?

Huang Xiaolong’s heart thumped, was the Cangqiong Sacred Land they were talking about related to his master? Even the name was similar! The Divine Tuo Holy World was large, and it might not have been strange for another expert to possess the same name as his master, but it was too coincidental.

“What a pity. Wang Xueru’s talent can be considered pretty decent. Her godhead is in the top ten ranks, and so is her saint physique. She’s definitely a talented disciple in most of the sacred lands. It’s too bad she chose to join the Cangqiong Sacred Land. Who would have thought that she would seal off her own future by accepting the Cangqiong Old Man as her Master?”

“She must have fried her brain or something to join the Cangqiong Sacred Land. I heard that Young Master Tang Jin is planning to toy with her before he kills her during the Convent of the Wind and Clouds.”

“Don’t tell me Young Master Tang Jin is really going to do that. No matter what, she’s a named disciple of the Cangqiong Old Man!”

“So what if he does? The Cangqiong Old Man wouldn’t dare to touch Young Master Tang Jin anyway!”

The chatter went on and Huang Xiaolong heard everything.

Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and the others turned to look at each other. Could they be talking about the Cangqiong Old Man they knew?!

Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover the whereabouts of his master.

“Hello everyone, can you elaborate more on the Convent of the Wind and Clouds? Especially the part about the Cangqiong Sacred Land,” Huang Xiaolong stepped forward without any hesitation and asked. “I want to understand a bit more of what you guys were saying.”

When they saw a human walking towards them with a question, the disciples barely glanced at him before turning to walk away.

Seeing this, Long Jianfei and Zi Dongping planned to stop them from leaving, but Huang Xiaolong shook his head and tossed over several holy spiritual jadestones.

Huang Xiaolong had learned from Long Jianfei and Duan Feng that the Divine Tuo Holy World didn’t accept any random currency. They only accepted something called divine tuo dao coins.

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t have any on him, he had tons of holy spiritual jadestones. No matter where he went, he knew that they would be accepted.

Indeed, the reactions of the disciples were the same as soon as they received the jadestones. Smiles filled their faces as they turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

“Since you’re so generous, we’ll tell you everything you want to know!” one of the disciples laughed sheepishly.

All of them were half-True Saints, and the strongest among them was a Sixth Order half-True Saint.

Of course, all of them were acting arrogantly as their backings were pretty strong. Their patriarch was a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and they were holy princes of their factions.

“I want to know more about the Convent of the Wind and Clouds and the Cangqiong Sacred Land,” Huang Xiaolong said indifferently. He wasn’t offended by their arrogance at all. He felt that there was no point in creating enmity with random disciples.

“The Convent of the Wind and Clouds is a gathering held by the Singular Sacred Land. The experts of the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and the other surrounding sacred lands will gather together to exchange pointers!” When the disciple mentioned his Singular Sacred Land, he couldn’t help but feel a little prouder.

“The Cangqiong Sacred Land emerged as a power a hundred years ago, and everyone refers to their patriarch as the Cangqiong Old Man. He wasn’t tactful enough, and he offended the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and the Freezing Desert Sacred Land. They plan to use this opportunity to teach the disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land a lesson!” another disciple explained.

As for the ‘teaching’, they were planning to take advantage of the exchange to kill the disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land, including Wang Xueru.

Even though the Convent of the Wind and Clouds was jointly organized by several sacred lands, and they forbade the participation of the patriarchs, it was a huge event! Only twelve disciples of each faction could participate!Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Since the Cangqiong Sacred Land was a new power, the Cangqiong Old Man had sent his named disciple to lead the disciples of the sacred land.

“Even though Wang Xueru is pretty talented, she is nothing compared to Young Master Tang Jin! Moreover, she’s only in the mid-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm. Young Master Tang Lin has already reached the peak of the late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm! She will definitely turn into a cripple at the end of the battle!” The disciples from the Singular Sacred Land shook his head in pity.

“Not only that, I’m sure he will enjoy her body to the fullest!” another disciple mocked.

He turned to Huang Xiaolong and chuckled, “Are you related to the Cangqiong Sacred Land? If you’re not, I shall give you some advice. Keep your distance from them. They are a new power without any backing, and they won’t be able to survive for long. They will only be able to hold out for a little while before the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land join hands to eliminate them.”

“The only reason they haven’t acted is because the Cangqiong Sacred Land is too damn small! After a few more years, they will definitely take action.”

Huang Xiaolong gained a gradual understanding of the entire situation.

Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and the others looked at each other in surprise.

Huang Xiaolong then proceeded to ask about the situation regarding the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and the Freezing Desert Sacred Land.

When he heard that the masters of the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land were only at the late-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

Late-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestors were nothing in his eyes.

According to the disciples, the two factions weren’t under the protection of any superpower either.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong knew that as disciples of the Singular Sacred Land, their knowledge might have been limited. He decided to look for more information regarding the two sacred lands when he left.

Only after a few more questions did he dismiss them.

Now that Huang Xiaolong and the others knew where they were, they could think of their next step. The Divine Tuo Holy World had tons of continents, and they were in a tiny region called the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave.

Based on Long Jianfei’s memories, they were quite a distance away from the Dragon Fish Creed. It would be impossible for them to head over in the near future.

“Young Lord, should we take part in the Convent of Wind and Clouds?” Long Jianfei asked. “If we make our way there, we should be able to make it before it begins.”

The Convent of the Wind and Clouds was held in a sacred land near them. It wouldn’t take long for them to rush over.

“Alright, let’s head over before going to the Cangqiong Sacred Land to pay a visit to my master,” Huang Xiaolong said.
