Although it was hailed as one of the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s perilous lands, the Hailstone Mainland was reachable through transmission arrays. Still, one was unable to reach the Hailstone Mainland from the Cloudsea Mainland with a one-time direct transfer. Huang Xiaolong had to pass through six transmission arrays before he arrived in the Hailstone Mainland.

Stepping out from the Hailstone Mainland’s transmission array, Huang Xiaolong was assaulted by biting cold gales all around, and even he felt the intense chill on his skin.

Looking to the horizon, nothing but a boundless span of ice and snow entered his sight. Huang Xiaolong leaped to the air, flying off at high speed.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong spotted a big towering city not far ahead, built in the middle of the ice snowfield.

“This is Hailstone City, also the sole human city on the Hailstone Mainland.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said, “In the deeper parts of the Hailstone Mainland, the yin element within the frigid cold is extreme, you can stop by Hailstone City and equip yourself with a good fire element armor.”’

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement, flying toward the Hailstone City’s entrance. A short while later, he reached outside the city. Looking closely at the hundred zhang tall city walls, he noted that every inch of the city wall was piled up using a kind of stone called ice stone. This ice stone was extremely hard and transparent like ice, emitting a soft lustre. The drifting snow actually skimmed off its surface.

Entering the city, Huang Xiaolong surprisingly discovered that the city wasn’t as deserted as he had imagined. The streets were wide, similar to the streets in the Black Warrior City, pedestrians going one way or the other and carriages filled the streets on both sides. Truly a hive of activity.

Shops were everywhere in sight.

“The Hailstone Mainland is rich in minerals and elixirs. As it is also the kingdom of the ice element demonic beasts, many families, trading firms, and experts would frequently come here to purchase elixirs and demonic beast cores.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi explained. “There are also many family disciples that come to Hailstone Mainland to hunt ice element demonic beasts as training.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded as he listened, then a thought crossed his mind, asking, “Do you know which family the Hailstone City’s Castellan belongs to?”

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi shook his head, “Each generation of Hailstone City’s Castellan is very mysterious, no one knows their origin, yet each generation of Castellans possesses unfathomable strength, even those super forces’ Ancestors dare not underestimate the generations of Castellans.”

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised. Even those super forces’ old monsters were apprehensive against the Hailstone City’s Castellan?

“But, you need to be careful, fighting and killing are not prohibited inside Hailstone City.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi reminded Huang Xiaolong. “Many God Realm masters came to purchase materials in Hailstone City, but many of them died inside these city walls as well. Although you’re wearing the Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciple robe and those with ill-intent might not have the guts to kill you in broad daylight, there’s always an exception.”

“I know.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. He already noticed the faint rusted scent of blood the moment he entered the city, which was why Huang Xiaolong had been vigilant ever since he entered.

“Hailstone Inn?” When Huang Xiaolong was passing by an inn, his footsteps stopped.

“This Hailstone Inn’s Hailstone Wine is excellent.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi commented, “I’ve tasted it in the past, you should go in and have a taste.”

Huang Xiaolong entered without needing much persuasion.

Stepping into the inn, Huang Xiaolong took a quick glance at the environment inside. There weren’t many people inside, close to half of the tables were empty, merely seven to eight tables were occupied, consisting of both men and women, young and old, with different styles of clothing.

The inn fell into a momentary silence when Huang Xiaolong stepped inside.

That was because Huang Xiaolong was more eye-catching than the others, clad in his Black Warrior Institute inner disciple robe, causing many pairs of eyes to take an extra glance at him. A Black Warrior Institute inner disciple would always attract attention regardless where they went.

Greeted by the inn’s worker, Huang Xiaolong sat down at an empty table in a corner, ordering two jugs of Hailstone Wine and some accompanying dishes.

The inn worker returned shortly with two jugs of Hailstone Wine and several small dishes, serving them on the table.

Huang Xiaolong opened up one of the wine jugs. The fragrance that floated out wasn’t strong, in fact, it was a little weak in Huang Xiaolong’s opinion. Pouring out some into the wine bowl, he took a big gulp, instantly feeling an icy sensation flowing through his body. A layer deeper to the iciness was a crisp bite, providing a fiery hotness after the icy coldness, leaving a warm, comfortable feeling throughout his body.

“Good wine!” Huang Xiaolong praised out loud.

While Huang Xiaolong was praising and drinking by himself, a group of people walked into the inn.

Huang Xiaolong noticed the big group of people walking in and was stunned when he glanced in their direction. It was actually Zhao Chen and Xie Hui! Also Sin City’s Castellan, Zhao Yi! Other than these three people, the rest seemed to be masters from both Zhao and Xie Families.

‘Truly, what a coincidence! To run into Zhao Chen and Xie Hui here of all places.’

A cold glint flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The last time, if it weren’t for him rushing back in time, his family and Shi Xiaofei would have died in the hands of those two Ying Family masters!

As if sensing Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, after entering the inn, Zhao Chen, Xie Hui, and the rest of the group looked over in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

“Huang Xiaolong!!” Both Zhao Chen and Xie Hui cried out in unison. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The look in the eyes of Sin City Castellan’s Zhao Yi and the middle-aged man standing beside Xie Hui sharpened. This middle-aged man was none other than the Cosmos God Cult Leader, Xie Chao.

“You actually did not die?” Was the next sentence Zhao Chen blurted out.

Zhao Chen and Xie Hui exchanged a glance, did the Ying Family’s masters not go to Martial Spirit World? Or perhaps Huang Xiaolong did not rush back after hearing the news last time?

“Both of you are very disappointed?” The corner of Huang Xiaolong’s mouth curved up with heavy ridicule.

“Hehe, indeed a little disappointed.” Xie Hui’s eyes were filled with thick hatred, “But, Huang Xiaolong, this let’s see who can save you this time!”

“This little punk is that Martial Spirit World’s so-called Beast God, Huang Xiaolong?” One of the old men within the Zhao Family suddenly spoke, his voice was shrill and piercing.

“Yes, Elder Zhao Rui.” Zhao Chen answered respectfully.

The Cosmos God Cult Leader Xie Chao was brimming with killing intent, “Huang Xiaolong, you destroyed my Cosmos God Cult, even if you’re a Black Warrior Institute inner disciple, today I’ll make you wish you were dead!” The Cosmos God Cult was his blood, sweat, and tears over a thousand years, the blood grudge of a sect’s annihilation was tantamount to killing one’s father. Xie Chao wished he could tear off Huang Xiaolong’s flesh and drink his blood even in his sleep.

Of course, neither the Zhao Family nor the Xie Family knew that Huang Xiaolong was the Black Warrior Institute Principal’s personal disciple, merely taking him for an ordinary inner disciple.

Huang Xiaolong already half-guessed that this middle-aged man was the Cosmos God Cult Leader Xie Chao, though it did not change the indifference on his face, “Is that so? I could annihilate your Cosmos God Cult in the past and I can kill you today just the same!”

“You’re courting death!” Cosmos God Cult Leader Xie Chao roared with fury, leaping forward. His momentum fully released as he aimed both fists at Huang Xiaolong.

The ferocious fist force tore space, all the furniture in his path was thrown into the air, bursting into fragments. Customers all around retreated to safety in haste.

Huang Xiaolong harrumphed coldly as he sat there, casually pointing a finger. The Absolute Soul Finger shot out, instantly shattering the force of Xie Chao’s fists, and it continued forward, piercing a hole through Xie Chao’s chest.

Xie Chao’s body was thrown back in the air from the opposing force, blood spurting out from his body like arrows.

The sudden turn of events shocked everyone.

Xie Chao was a peak mid-First Order God Realm, he needed just a little bit more to advance to late-First Order God Realm, but he was defeated in one move!

“FATHER!” Xie Hui regained his senses, arriving next to Xie Chao in a flicker, crying out loud.
