Chapter 2386: Four Seas Holy Grounds

Seeing that the aggressors had finally left, Lin Xiaoying rode on her Snow Beast and approached Huang Xiaolong. “Little Brother Thirteen, how about it?! I saved you again!”

She swept her gaze over Huang Xiaolong’s mount and a pout appeared on her face. “Where’s the little piggy! Why did you change your mount?”

Beads of cold sweat dripped down Huang Xiaolong’s forehead. He had never expected her to remember his Golden Pig Treasure! Right now, he was riding on a regular Ninth Tribulation half- True Saint Realm profound beast. The Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast, the Golden Pig Treasure, and the Rainbow Phoenix were kept in his Darkness Holy Ring.

All of a sudden, Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi approached Huang Xiaolong with the other experts from the Clear Snow Palace.

“Young Master Thirteen....” The ladies greeted Huang Xiaolong with smiles on their faces.

Huang Xiaolong returned their greeting with a smile.

“Thirteen, where’s Little Piggy?” Lin Xiaoying asked again.

Huang Xiaolong was at a loss for words. He hadn’t expected that she would continue to harp on the topic.

With a helpless sigh, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Golden Pig Treasure.

“Little Piggy!” A look of excitement appeared on Lin Xiaoying’s face. She leaped towards the pig and caressed it as though it was her baby.

Li Xinyu laughed, “Junior Sister, if you really like this pig, why don’t you ask Young Master to give it to you?”

Glancing at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of her eye, Lin Xiaoying pouted, “He’s not willing to part with Piggy! What a miser!”

In the past, she had begged Huang Xiaolong, but failed to convince him.

The ‘anger’ she held in her heart could only be vented whenever she pestered Huang Xiaolong.

Hearing her complaints, Huang Xiaolong didn’t know how to react.

“Young Master, did you remain in the Profound River all this while?” Tan Juan seemed to have realized something, and she asked.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t planning on lying, and he simply nodded his head. “That’s right. I cultivated in the Profound River for a period of time.”

“You... You reached the Ninth Order Venerable Realm! How?!” Tan Juan stared at Huang Xiaolong as though she was looking at a monster.

The ladies stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

“Ninth... Ninth Order Venerable?!”

They jumped in fright.

Over ten years ago, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t even in the Seventh Order Venerable Realm when they first met! When they met him again in the Profound River, he had barely broken into the Seventh Order Venerable Realm! However, he was already a Ninth Order Venerable when he stood before them!

If they knew that he had entered the Ninth Order Venerable Realm three years ago, they would probably be too shocked for words.

“Thirteen... You wouldn’t be a reincarnated Primal Ancestor, right?!” Lin Xiaoying muttered.

As soon as the words left her lips, she found it incredulous. None of them had heard of a Primal Ancestor falling in the Holy World.

The only one would probably be the suspicious black corpse in the Black Corpse Continent.

However, a reincarnated Primal Ancestor wouldn’t be able to cultivate as quickly as him!

“I might be...” Huang Xiaolong joked.

In the past, there were times Huang Xiaolong had doubted his origins. He had felt that his talent was indeed a little too suspicious. He had even felt that there was a chance he was the incarnation of some bigshot!

Whatever the case, he wasn’t willing to dwell over it. “Were you guys in Profound City all along?”

Li Xinyi stared at him, and she continued, “We returned to the palace previously. We’re here because we heard that the black corpse in the Black Corpse Continent has reappeared. We’re here to check it out.”

The appearance of the black corpse was public knowledge by now, and she wasn’t planning to hide it from Huang Xiaolong.

Hearing their reason, Huang Xiaolong nodded in surprise.

“Other than us, the members of the Devil Palace have come as well. It’s not just the six Devil Princes of the palace now. The mid-level True Saint experts of the Devil Palace will be present as well. Our trip to the Profound River will probably be filled with dangers.”

Even though she didn’t state it, the experts of the Clear Snow Palace would probably show up really soon.

“I’ve heard that the hall master of the Holy Heavens, Shi Feng, and Holy Prince Li Tan will personally lead the members of the Holy Heavens here!”

“The True Saints of the Holy Lands Alliance are here as well. Every single one of the Holy Grounds in the top ten ranks sent high-level True Saints!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath.

He was surprised that the Hall Master Shi Feng would personally head over! Neither had he expected for Holy Prince Li Tan to come.

There were too many experts who had set their sights on the Profound River!

“Thirteen, what do you think of the current situation? The Profound River is in chaos right now, and you should travel with us.” Lin Xiaoying persuaded Huang Xiaolong.

However, he shook his head.

It was impossible for him to travel with them into the Profound River! After all, he had basically plundered the entire river for their stock of holy herbs!

Eventually, he parted ways with the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace.

Before they left, Lin Xiaoying stared at Huang Xiaolong with a burning gaze and Huang Xiaolong could only shake his head silently.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong turned and spoke to the others when he saw that the ladies were gone.

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong left, the people who were hunting him down, showed themselves.

“That brat has pretty good luck.”

Lan Jinfu sneered, “Even if the Clear Snow Palace saved him this time, they won’t be able to do so forever! He’s definitely going to die.”

...

A month later...

In a certain spot in the space of the Holy World, a massive flying ship appeared. It was the Winged Dragon Flying Ship. When Huang Xiaolong parted ways with the ladies of the Clear Snow Palace, he realized that the Profound City was no longer a safe place to be with all the high-level True Saints’ arrival. He didn’t mess with the experts of the Blue Whale Race and the others, and he simply concealed the presence of the Winged Dragon Flying Ship and left the city.

“Young master, the Four Seas Holy Grounds is just up ahead.” The Departing Sword Sage pointed into the space before them and a massive Holy Grounds entered their view. It was a pretty shade of blue, and it resembled an endless blue ocean.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. In the Profound River, he discovered a cave in a restricted area where the Four Seas Holy Emperor used to live. The holy emperor had carved his techniques on the wall, and he had even left his holy artifacts in there! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Four Seas Holy Emperor had also left behind his will for anyone, who obtained it, to gain control of the Four Seas Holy Gate.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as to the ownership of the Holy Gate. The most important thing to him was the inheritance the Four Seas Holy Emperor left behind.

When the holy emperor had entered the Profound River in the past, he had known that there was a chance of him falling, and he had prepared his inheritance in the depths of the forbidden region of the Four Seas Holy Gate.

If Huang Xiaolong could obtain his inheritance, his strength would balloon in an instant! It was even possible for him to enter the half-True Saint Realm directly!

One had to know that the Four Seas Holy Emperor wasn’t a mere expert at the Third Heaven True Saint Realm.
