Chapter 3281: Is Huang Shengan the Patriarch?

Everyone was stunned when they heard Tan Jian’s address.

“Huang Xiaolong?! Is he the new grand elder of the Huang Family?!” Chen Feiliang was stunned.

“Isn’t the patriarch of the Huang Family Huang Shengan? How is he so respectful to Huang Xiaolong?” Many experts exclaimed in amazement.

The way Huang Shengan treated Huang Xiaolong had exceeded their expectations.

Sun Yao and Sun Cheng stared at each other in confusion. They had no idea what was going on.

Murong Deng, Sun Yao, Tan Jian, and even Huang Ming were stunned. He looked at Huang Xiaolong who looked exactly the same as he did before, and a trace of coldness shot through his eyes. “You motherf*cker! It’s you! You caused the death of several hundred disciples of the Huang Family and formed an alliance with Huang Shengan to usurp the position of the patriarch! Kneel before me!”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression froze when he heard what Huang Ming said. With a cold expression, he pointed casually at Huang Ming.

Killing intent rose in Huang Ming’s heart when he saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t getting to his knees. He roared in rage, “I’ll kill you right now, you disrespectful fool!”

Using all the energy in his body, he summoned a giant blade before slashing towards Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone present already knew that Huang Ming had a shockingly powerful blade art. After all, he trained with the Demon Blade, Fan Yidong! They were sworn brothers, and their skills were pretty close.

With the power of Huang Ming’s energy pouring into the blade, hundreds of blade light shot through the skies and a terrifying energy surrounded those present.

Even Murong Deng, the old ancestor of the Murong Family, was stunned by his strength.

A ray of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s finger and slammed into the blade lights, shattering them easily. It continued to smash into Huang Ming’s chest and sent him flying.

Crashing into the ground in the Blue Dragon Orchard, chaos ensued.

“What?!”

Sun Yao, Sun Cheng, Tan Jian, and the others felt a bomb going off in their heads.

“He’s not at the high-level Nascent Soul Realm!” Someone yelled.

Everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, and their faces changed. At that instant,everyone could see that Huang Xiaolong had surpassed the Enlightenment Realm.

Moreover, he was an expert several times more terrifying than Huang Ming!

A terrifying possibility flashed through Sun Yao’s mind.

The question that plagued him several days ago was no longer as perplexing.

When everyone was shocked at Huang Xiaolong’s sudden display of strength, a loud snort came from the skies. Everyone saw Demon Blade Fan Yidong’s giant blade appearing right in front of Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Fan Yidong was a Second Level Enlightenment Realm expert, but he was stronger than Huang Ming by a whole level! His blade was too damn fast, and no one managed to react to his attack!

Slashing downwards, Huang Xiaolong casually raised his hand to stop the blade with his index and middle fingers.

Fan Yidong’s eyes widened in shock.

So did everyone else as they stared at the blade between Huang Xiaolong’s fingers.

The reason Fan Yidong was hailed as the Demon Blade was not because of his obsession with blades. There was another reason, and that was the demonic blade in his hands! He obtained the blade from some random demonic lands outside of Earth, and it was a peak-grade artifact! Even experts at the peak of the mid-level Enlightenment Realm wouldn’t dare to meet the blade head on!

However, Huang Xiaolong grabbed it with two fingers!

Casually flicking his fingers, the blade between his fingers shattered into countless pieces. In the next instant, Huang Xiaolong stretched out his hand and grabbed Fan Yidong’s head! With a slight twist, Fan Yidong’s head was twisted off his shoulders.

With the lower half of his body falling from the skies, it landed not too far away from Huang Ming’s body. Huang Ming caught sight of Fan Yidong’s corpse falling as he crawled to his feet.

A ray of light emerged from Fan Yidong’s body, and his nascent soul tried to escape.

“Lord, please have mercy!” He got to his knees before Huang Xiaolong and begged for his life. Terror filled his eyes.

Expressionless, Huang Xiaolong reached out and sent a flame flying towards Fan Yidong’s soul. He failed to escape and was engulfed by the flames.

Miserable screams filled the air as Fan Yidong’s soul tumbled in the air.

“This… This cannot be real!” A grand elder of the Chen Family, Chen Feiliang revealed a frightened expression as he muttered to himself.

All of a sudden, a weird liquid started to fall from the skies. It landed on his face, and when Chen Feiliang wiped it off with his hands, he was greeted with a sight of red. It was the blood dripping from Fan Yidong’s head that was in Huang Xiaolong’s hands!

Chen Feiliang wasn’t the only one affected by it. The blood landed on the faces of many people present, but weirdly enough, no one tried to dodge the blood droplets. Not a single person dared to move a muscle.

Casually tossing the head to Huang Shengan behind him, Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards Murong Deng and the others. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

With four Enlightenment Realm experts and more than a hundred Nascent Soul Realm experts present, they trembled in their boots. Even the experts in the Nascent Soul Realm sent by the Huaxia Alliance’s government didn’t dare to move.

Without showing off the slightest bit of his aura, Huang Xiaolong’s presence alone made everyone feel a mountain pressing down on their hearts.

“Are you the old ancestor of the Sun Family?” Huang Xiaolong asked when he arrived before Sun Yao.

Unable to withstand the fear in his heart, Sun Yao fell to his knees and he stuttered, “Lord… Lord… I am Sun Yao of the Sun Family!”

“Lord, we are from the Sun Family…” Sun Cheng wanted to explain the matter of how they tried to swallow the Huang Family’s businesses, but a ray of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s finger and incinerated the man before he could finish.

The experts standing around felt the hair on their body standing on end.

“I don’t like interruptions when I’m talking.” Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across those present.

Lowering their heads in an instant, no one dared to look him in the eye.

“Lord, mercy!” Sun Yao smashed his head into the ground and started to explain, “I only learned of the matter after it happened! Lord, please spare my life! I am willing to submit to Lord’s rule as long as you don’t kill me!”

Sun Yao continued to smash his head into the ground and his forehead split apart. Despite his injury, he didn’t stop.

Every time his head slammed into the ground, the hearts of those present would tremble.

The experts of the Sun Family fell to their knees as they mirrored their old ancestor’s actions. Tan Bi, the old ancestor of the Tan Family, followed soon after with the members of the Tan Family. They explained the matter of swallowing the Huang Family’s businesses hoping Huang Xiaolong would let them off.

When they were finally done with their explanations, Huang Xiaolong casually uttered, “Alright. Get up.”

Sun Yao and the others were shocked as they raised their heads in disbelief. They thought that all of them would die there that day.

“Are you planning to kneel there forever?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Snapping back to reality, their hearts trembled in fear as they thanked Huang Xiaolong in haste before getting to their feet.
