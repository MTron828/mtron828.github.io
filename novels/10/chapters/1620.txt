Jia Yuan stared at Gu Zheng with a cold gaze. “That’s right. Gu Zheng, you had better kneel down and beg for forgiveness. The Lord might actually forgive you after taking Wang Sinan into account and spare your life.”

Gu Zheng roared with laughter, but hidden behind it was unrestrained killing intent. He stood in mid air as he mocked Huang Xiaolong, “Kneel and apologize? Beg for forgiveness? Jia Yuan, did you cultivate yourself into a retard?!” Fury masked his voice and he yelled, “Who do you think you are? Do you think that I won’t dare to kill you because of your elder status in the organization?’

Huang Xiaolong had killed Gu Fei right before his eyes. According to him, nothing could be more humiliating. Jia Yuan didn’t even speak up on his behalf and was even asking him to kneel and apologize to Huang Xiaolong... How could he remain calm?!

The rage in his heart reached the boiling point.

As soon as the words left his mouth, he slammed his palm down towards Jia Yuan. “Kneel before me and apologize, RIGHT NOW!” A giant palm print smashed towards Jia Yuan’s head as though a mountain was falling from the sky.

Gu Zhen snorted in disdain.

Even though he really didn’t dare to cripple Jia Yuan, making him kneel wasn’t something Gu Zheng feared. He wanted Jia Yuan to kneel before him before everyone’s eyes. He wanted to let Jia Yuan know the outcome of offending him for that Asura noble!

Seeing the power of Gu Zheng’s attack, Jia Yuan’s expression changed. Even though he was in the First Order God King Realm and had already entered the God King Realm for several tens of years, he would never be able to protect himself from Gu Zheng’s Fourth Order God King Realm strength.

“Protect Lord Jia Yuan!”

The Netherguards circulated their godforce and a terrifyingly strong protection formation appeared before Jia Yuan, blocking Gu Zheng’s attack.

Looking at the twenty thousand troops before him, Gu Zheng shickered. Even though the formation possessed a shocking amount of godforce, it wasn’t anywhere near enough to block his attack. They would be able to deflect only fifty percent of the power regardless of how hard they tried.

The remaining fifty percent of his power was more than sufficient to slam Jia Yuan into the ground, forcing him to kneel before him.

It was indeed as he thought.

The godforce mustered by the army slammed into his blood colored palm and a storm was swept up.

After a horrifyingly loud blast, Gu Zheng’s giant blood red palm weakened by about half and continued to shoot towards Jia Yuan.

All the experts witnessing the scene sucked in a cold breath.

Just as Gu Zheng’s attack was about to land on Jia Yuan’s head, a finger poked out from the void.

The finger appeared out of nowhere. It seemed to somewhat resemble a pillar, supporting the weight of the heavens, but it also seemed to be a spear shooting across the annals of time as it pierced through Gu Zheng’s attack with a single strike. Without stopping, it headed towards Gu Zheng.

Gu Zheng’s expression changed and he tried to dodge. However, the finger was too quick and the instant it appeared, he was struck by it. Like a kite with a broken string, he was sent flying. He slammed into the ground below.

“Boom!”

After a loud blast, Gu Zheng landed somewhere on the street and cracks formed like spider webs around him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Everyone felt their jaws dropping at the sight before them.

This... Gu Zheng was actually... Their gaze turned to Huang Xiaolong and they stared at him in shock.

The person who had made the move was precisely Huang Xiaolong.

Other than Jia Yuan, everyone felt an incomparable shock in their hearts.

“You... You’re not at the First Order God King realm?!” Gu Zheng crawled up from the ground and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. A look of disbelief flashed past his eyes when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

“I never said I was in the First Order God King Realm.” Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he continued, “You guys assumed that I was in the First Order God King Realm.”

Gu Zheng felt rage overwhelm him as he screamed at Huang Xiaolong, “You were the one who said that you broke into the God King Realm tens of years ago. What else can you be other than a First Order God King?! How dare you lie to all of us!”

From the attack Huang Xiaolong had sent out previously, he was definitely stronger than a Fourth Order God King. According to Gu Zheng, there was no way Huang Xiaolong could have broken through to the God King Realm tens of years ago.

It is definitely impossible for someone to break through past the Fourth Order God King Realm in several tens of years!

“Do you have any more last words?” Huang Xiaolong completely ignored Gu Zheng’s accusation.

Gu Zheng chuckled to himself and snapped, “Brat, do you really think that you will be able to kill me? I was merely caught off guard previously. Moreover, I only used sixty percent of my strength in my previous attack. I have many ancient divine arts in my arsenal!”

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s strength was a little too shocking for him to comprehend, he was confident that he would be able to win if he gave it his all.

As soon as he spoke, the aura around him started to balloon.

The blood colored aura around him congealed and formed crimson clouds around his body.

As the crimson clouds rose above his head, they formed a sea of blood-red clouds, blotting out the sky.

He stood right below it, seemingly turning into an undefeatable existence.

Of course, how could Gu Zheng ever imagine that Huang Xiaolong had merely flicked his finger when he had unleashed that ‘terrifying’ attack on him previously? The move he made was merely a millionth of the strength his True Dragon Physique had to offer.

Looking at Gu Zheng’s confident expression and the surging aura around him. Huang Xiaolong shook his head. He raised his left hand and formed a claw. With a light slap, he sent it flying towards Gu Zheng.

In an instant, a giant claw that was big enough to cover the heavens and earth formed. The phantoms of ghosts, devils, demons, and asura appeared out of nowhere and charged towards Gu Zheng along with the massive claw.

It was precisely the Asura Demon Claw that Huang Xiaolong hadn’t used in a long time.

Looking at the unending phantoms, everyone felt their scalp go numb.

Gu Zheng wasn’t an exception.

Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, The sea of crimson-colored blood above Gu Zheng was shattered by Huang Xiaolong’s Asura Ghost Claw and all the phantoms charged into Gu Zheng’s body.

Gu Zheng’s body was sent flying once again and he smashed heavily in a distant building. As he slid down onto the ground, frightening sounds of explosions came from inside his body and it rang out non-stop.

Everytime an explosion was heard, it was followed by Gu Zheng’s miserable shriek.

After all the screams had subsided, Gu Zheng remained motionless on the ground and the expression of his face was one of shock. His body was mangled beyond recognition and he wasn’t able to move the slightest muscle. Rather than saying that he wasn’t able to move a muscle, it was more appropriate to say that his body was no longer under his control. He was as dead as could be.

Huang Xiaolong stared at his corpse with an indifferent expression. Even though there was the Gu Family and Wang Sinan behind him, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with the trouble they would bring to him.

As long as he passed the test the next day and became a six star Netherking, no one would dare to touch him.

He hadn’t been afraid of the Fiend God Emperor Palace when he was back in the Divine World, much less the Gu Family.

As the Gu Family’s inspector, Gu Zheng’s death in the Brookspring Plane shook the higher ups of the Gu Family.

Two tall middle aged men who were located in one of the cities not too far away from the Brookspring Plane were notified of the current events. One of them had a head full of white hair while the other had blood-red colored, long hair.

The man with white hair was precisely the Gu Family’s grand elder, Gu Cheng. As for the person with red hair, he was the grand elder of the Netherworld King’s Organization, Wang Sinan.

“Zheng’er!” Gu Cheng’s eyes turned bloodshot when he read the summoning signal and he released a mournful cry.
