Hu Dan’s mind was still blank when the tip of the Mulberry Sword in Huang Xiaolong’s hand slightly tilted, picking out Liu Lei’s godhead from his head before putting both the godhead and Liu Lei’s spatial ring into his Asura Ring.

A moment later, Hu Dan came to her senses. She turned to look at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief, “Y-you, you killed him!”

Previously at the square in the Fortune Gate City, Hu Dan felt that this black-haired young man’s strength was on par with hers, never had she imagined that his strength would actually be so terrifying.

Killing a Dragon Origin Sect early First Order Ancient God Realm with just one slash of the sword? What concept of strength was this?

Not to mention the fact that this black-haired person had the guts to kill a Dragon Origin Sect disciple! Perhaps he couldn’t tell that Liu Lei was a Dragon Origin Sect disciple? No, that was impossible, she would never believe he couldn’t tell Liu Lei’s Dragon Origin Sect disciple identity.

The buzzing noise in Hu Dan’s head didn’t seem to stop.

Huang Xiaolong was too lazy answer a silly Hu Dan asking if he killed a Dragon Origin Sect disciple, the question was literally stupid. A sliver of flame flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s finger, burning Liu Lei’s corpse until nothing remained.

Then, he walked away.

“You, hey, wait!” Realizing Huang Xiaolong was leaving, she called out in panic.

Huang Xiaolong stopped and turned around, looking at Hu Dan. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong really stopped and turned around, but Hu Dan didn’t know what to say, stammering nervously she asked, “You, you’re not afraid of the Dragon Origin Sect?”

Huang Xiaolong joked, “If I’m not telling and you’re not telling, then the Dragon Origin Sect won’t know. You won’t go out and tell the Dragon Origin Sect, right?”

“No no no no!” Hu Dan shook her head and waved her hands.

Huang Xiaolong continued half-jokingly, “If you dare to leak a word about this, I’ll have Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo to banish you from the Golden Dragon Gate.”

Hu Dan dazed for a second blurted out, “You know our Ancestor and Gate Chief?!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, neither admitting nor denying. Not only did he know them, after he obtained the Golden Dragon heritage, Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo had to call him Ancestor.

Then, what should Hu Dan call him? Great-Great Ancestor?

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong sped away.

Hu Dan looked lost as she stared in the direction where Huang Xiaolong’s figure sped away, contemplating how this black-haired young man knew their Golden Dragon Sect’s Ancestor and Gate Chief.

‘Once the preliminary round ends, I’ll go ask the Ancestor and Gate Chief.’ Hu Dan decided. Her gaze then fell onto the place Liu Lei was killed; even now, she had a surreal feeling.

A moment later, Hu Dan sped away.

At this point of time at the Fortune City square, the Dragon Origin Sect Chief Chen Ding and other Dragon Origin Sect experts saw, on the crystal wall, their eighty-third ranked disciple Liu Lei’s name exploding in a shower of light After the glaring light dissipated, the names on the ranking shifted.

Chen Ding and the present Dragon Origin Sect experts were dumbfounded.

The spectators on the square also noticed Liu Lei’s demise. After a while, more and more people noticed, causing the square to be in an uproar.

The Dragon Origin Sect was the head of the top ten islands, thus their disciples were the subject of attention during the All-Islands Great War. In fact, disciples in the top one hundred attracted the most attention.

No one had ever expected the eighty-third ranked Liu Lei to actually die!

“It seems this Liu Lei’s luck wasn’t good, did he die in the hands of a magic beast, ghoul, or evil spirit?”

“If Liu Lei didn’t die, in the end, he could have definitely stayed in the top one hundred!”

People in the crowd shook their heads at Liu Lei’s unexpected death. The general opinion was that Liu Lei’s death in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield was most likely due to a magic beast, ghoul, or evil spirit, for none of them thought that other participants would dare to kill a Dragon Origin Sect disciple.

Chen Ding sullenly ordered, “After the preliminary round ends, find out Liu Lei’s cause of death.” Each of the Dragon Origin Sect’s disciples participating in the All-Islands Great War had been nurtured by numerous herbs and other resources, each of their deaths was a great loss to the Dragon Origin Sect. Not to mention that Liu Lei wasn’t just a Dragon Origin Sect disciple but also the nephew of Chen Ding’s distant relative, and he had always appreciated Liu Lei’s talent.

“Yes, Sect Chief!” The group of Dragon Origin Sect Grand Elders respectfully complied.

A cold light glinted in Chen Ding’s eyes, exuding an overwhelming pressure from his body, if Liu Lei’s death was related to the nature of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, nothing could be said, but if other disciples dared to kill their Dragon Origin Sect’s people, they were seeking death!

...

Huang Xiaolong continued flying toward the deeper part of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield after killing Liu Lei.

Even though the preliminary round duration was limited to three months, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried that he wouldn’t be able to make it back in time. The token given to each participant had a small transmission array inscribed within. Once three months’ time was up, Gong Fei would activate the transmission array on the token, transferring all disciples back to the starting place.

As the sword in Huang Xiaolong’s hand slashed and cut on the way, magic beasts, ghouls, and evil spirits were turned into points, rising at a rapid pace that, by the end of the day, Huang Xiaolong’s position had risen to twenty-sixth! This was his current position.

The surroundings slowly darkened. Just as Huang Xiaolong decided to look for a safe cave and cultivate for the night, he suddenly sensed two strange energy fluctuations ahead of him.

This wasn’t the same type of energy fluctuations coming from magic beasts, ghouls, or evil spirits, yet these two energy fluctuations felt familiar to Huang Xiaolong.

Asura!

This was a Hell Shura’s energy fluctuation!

When Huang Xiaolong was still in the lower realm, he cultivated the Asura Tactics and had, at one time, refined an Asura, obtaining the Asura bloodline.

There were Asuras in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield?! This was unexpected news for Huang Xiaolong.

‘Could it be?!’ A second later, he remembered. A few years back, the Soul Tribe’s Young Lord Hun Dishan came to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield precisely for these two Asura Kings.

Huang Xiaolong immediately flew in the direction of the two Asura Kings’ energy fluctuations. Soon, he spotted two burly monsters with a thick horn at the center of their heads and bodies covered with scales.

Indeed, they were two Hell Asuras!

But these two Asuras in front of him were several times bigger than the Asura he had refined in the lower realm, not to mention the alarming pressure from their bodies. Huang Xiaolong could feel their frightening Asura force.

The two Asura Kings that were feasting on raw magic beasts’ flesh when they sensed Huang Xiaolong approaching them. Raising their heads, their scarlet eyes were looking straight at him, a ferocious light gleaming inside. In the next instant, they lunged at Huang Xiaolong.

These two late-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm Asura Kings’ strength was comparable to the regular early Fifth Order Ancient God Realm cultivator. Their movements were too fast for Huang Xiaolong to see clearly. Fortunately, he had prepared himself in advance. The moment the two Asura Kings moved, Huang Xiaolong had summoned out the Black Baboon.

A second later, the Two Asura Kings were slapped away by the Giant chaos spiritual beast, crashing into the mountain in the far distance.

The earth shook as rocks and pebbles rolled down.

In a few breaths’ time, Huang Xiaolong was standing in the air, observing the two Asura Kings. The Black Baboon’s attack did not kill these two Asura Kings, merely rendering them unable to resist.

Huang Xiaolong believed that after refining these two Asura Kings’ blood, his strength would rise once more, as well as strengthening his True Divine Dragon Physique.

Pulling the two Asura Kings out, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered, he was curious to know how these two Asura Kings arrived in the Divine World from hell. Of course, he also wanted to know their purpose in coming to the Divine World.

Huang Xiaolong quickly began searching through their memories.
