Even after Huang Xiaolong had disappeared from their view, no one dared to make a single sound. Even the leader of the Devil Ape Cult, Zhao Chengyu, failed to open his mouth.

The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor stood rooted to his spot, and the devil qi around him rolled about unceasingly. The killing intent and rage boiling in his heart rose by several times.

“We’re going in as well.” The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor broke the silence, and he walked towards the entrance of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce. However, his steps were no longer as commanding as it once was.

The once tall figure of the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor seemed to have shrunken a little.

As Zhao Chengyu followed behind the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, the other members of the Devil Ape Cult carried the two injured ancestors as they walked through the entrance of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce. It was hard for them not to cut a sorry figure.

When the members of the Devil Ape Cult entered the auction venue, the originally silent square started to stir.

“Who in the world is that black-haired young man?! The creature behind him is too terrifying! I’m afraid it has power comparable to the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor!”

“Rubbish! The Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor has already surpassed the Emperor Realm! How can the beast following behind that young man be in the Sovereign Realm?!”

“Even though it might not be as strong as the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor, it should be comparable to the Chiyou Archdevil Ancestor or the Yellow Springs Archdevil Ancestor, right?!”

This time, no one dared to reject the idea.

The Chiyou Archdevil Ancestor ranked second among the twelve, and the Yellow Springs Archdevil Ancestor ranked third.

Discussions flew around, and everyone came up with tons of conclusions.

By the time they were racking their brains to come up with more interesting comparisons, Huang Xiaolong and his group had already arrived at the auction’s venue.

For the Eternal Auction, there were a total of twenty VIP suites. However, they had already been arranged and assigned to the twelve Archdevil Ancestors and their respective factions and some of the Devil World’s ancient superpowers. Huang Xiaolong and the rest could only sit together with the general audience.

The position Huang Xiaolong chose wasn’t bad. It wasn’t too eye-catching, but neither was it too quiet that the auctioneer would miss him.

After sitting down, tons of eyes landed on him. It seemed as though every expert in the hall wanted to dig out the secrets of Huang Xiaolong and the four odd beasts beside him with their gazes.

Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them, and he sat there with an indifferent look hanging on his face. The only thing he cared about was the start of the auction.

The auction hall was extremely huge, and it could easily house several million participants. There was an endless stream of people, and Huang Xiaolong and his group soon blended into the crowd.

There weren’t too many restrictions to enter the auction. All one needed to do was bring an Emperor Realm expert and pay a certain number of spirit stones. As such, the millions of seats were filled before long.

Noise filled the hall.

Of course, that was to be expected. Even if one person just said a single sentence, the resulting soundwave from millions of voices would be enough to raise the roof.

“Young Lady Xing Yinuo has arrived! She’s in the number one suite!”

“Chen Weijian has arrived as well! He’s in the number Sixteen suite! I’ve heard that almost half of the upper echelon of the Hundred Transformation Sect have come! Even Elder Long has made a personal appearance!”

The discussions flowed endlessly, and all of it made its way into Huang Xiaolong’s ear. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The hottest topic of discussion was obviously the three supreme geniuses of the Devil World.

Of course, the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor, and Huang Xiaolong came in a close second. The Six Nether Gate also managed to enter the sights of many superpowers in the Devil World.

The event that had happened at the Eternal Chamber of Commerce entrance couldn’t be forgotten in such a short amount of time. Huang Xiaolong and his group turned into the center of attention the moment the topic was brought up.

In the number One VIP suite, Xing Yinuo’s pretty gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong’s figure.

She had entered the venue a step ahead of Huang Xiaolong and the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, and she had failed to witness the scene that had played out at the entrance. However, the news had long reached her ears.

When the report was made, everyone in the room was shocked; from Xing Yinuo to the ancestors, there was no exception.

He managed to push the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor back?!

“Is there still no information on his identity?!” Xing Yinuo asked.

The person she was referring to was naturally Huang Xiaolong.

“No...” Li Yu, an ancestor of the Heavenly Punishment Sect, shook his head and continued, “It’s like this brat doesn’t exist in our Devil World! It is impossible for us to dig up anything on him!”

Xing Yinuo’s pretty eyes widened, and a brilliant light flashed through them. “Maybe, he isn’t a cultivator from our Devil World!”

All the ancestors in the room widened their eyes in shock.

They hadn’t even considered that possibility.

Li Yu shook his head again. “That isn’t possible. The devil qi around his body is extremely pure, and there is no way to fake that. If he isn’t someone from our Devil World, there is no way for him to possess such pure devil qi!”

He had merely made a suggestion, without expecting Xing Yinuo to think down that line.

Xing Yinuo fell into thought, and she muttered, “There’s a chance he might possess some sort of treasure from the Devil Race. It’s one way to explain the pure devil qi around him.”

All the ancestors looked at each other and didn’t know how to react.

That’s even more unlikely...

“If he’s not someone from our Devil World, his identity would be even harder to trace.” Wang Zhiqiao, another ancestor from the Heavenly Punishment Sect, said.

Xing Yinuo chuckled. A smile that rivaled the beauty of a hundred flowers bloomed on her face. “You forgot someone.”

All the ancestors looked at her with a curious expression.

“Gao Changran!”

However, the boisterous hall fell into complete silence all of a sudden. A group of Heavenless Devil Troops opened a path through the crowd and escorted the two auctioneers up onto the stage.

There were extremely few cases where more than one auctioneer headed the auction. However, this was one of the rare few cases where two auctioneers were in charge of the same auction.

The only time where more than one auctioneer was used was when the items were too precious.

This time, there were two anchoring treasures up for auction. One of them was the Tushita Flying Ship, and the other was the Devil Holy Water.

The Devil Holy Water was produced at the heart of the Devil World’s holy grounds. One drop would be born every one million years, and to gather one hundred drops, they would need a hundred million years. The Devil Holy Water was a holy object of the Devil World, and it was a supreme treasure. It could be used for many things, and for every race in the Devil World, the Devil Holy Water was something that couldn’t be obtained even if they had spirit stones.

In this auction, a total of a hundred drops of Devil Holy Water would be auctioned off!

One hundred drops! That was the accumulated amount over a hundred million years!

Huang Xiaolong was determined to obtain the Devil Holy Water in addition to the Tushita Flying Ship.

The moment he obtained it, he could repair the Yellow Springs Devil Robe. Not just that, he could also enhance its abilities. There was also no need to mention that the Devil Holy Water would be extremely beneficial for the Blood Eye Devil Stele and Heart of Hell he had.

In a flash, the auction started.

The first item was a bottle of mid-grade fire attributed grandmist spiritual pills.

Fire attributed grandmist spiritual pills were something one couldn’t lack if they wanted to head over to the Kingdom of Devil Beasts. As such, countless people started a bidding war.

After the first item was sold, the second item appeared. It was a fire attributed divine armor, and it was also a mid-grade grandmist artifact.

The auction progressed, and the items were sold one by one.

In a flash, several tens of items were sold.

“Now, we will start to auction off our anchoring treasures. First, up will be the Tushita Flying Ship!” The loud voice of the auctioneer filled the hall.

Everyone felt as though their heart skipped a beat in that instant. There were tons of people who had only come for the auction because they had received news that the Tushita Flying Ship was going on sale.
