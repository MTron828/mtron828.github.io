Chapter 03: Only Xiaolong Did Not Get Any? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

If others discovered that Huang Xiaolong not only managed to convert battle qi, but also broke through to become a First Order Warrior in just a few hours’ time, it would probably scare them half to death.

Even Huang Xiaolong himself found it hard to believe, much less the others.

Although from early on Huang Xiaolong had the suspicion that his martial spirit was not just some simple grade seven martial spirit, still, this result was too heaven-defying. According to his father, the higher the grade of a martial spirit, the higher the cultivation talent and the faster one’s cultivation speed. His grandfather, Huang Qide, possessed a top-tier grade eight Six-winged Golden Ape martial spirit and yet it took him half a year to breakthrough to First Order warrior, whereas he had only spent a few hours. In other words, his martial spirit’s grade was even higher than his grandfather’s!

Grade ten martial spirit? No, a grade ten martial spirits cultivation speed wouldn’t be this terrifying. A thought streaked across Huang Xiaolong’s mind ...

Superb talent martial spirit!

Superb martial spirits existed only in myths and legends.

Above grade ten there was said to exist grade eleven and even twelve! Although people were unsure about the highest grade a martial spirit could reach, it was certain that Huang Xiaolong’s martial spirit was definitely above grade ten.

Moments later, Huang Xiaolong managed to calm the excitement in his heart and continued running the Xuan Qin cultivation technique. The double-headed serpent once again emerged behind him with its mouths wide open, devouring the world’s spiritual energy while battle qi circulated along his meridians, following the First Order Warriors’ meridian route.

This time around, the battle qi’s circulation speed was a lot faster than before and Huang Xiaolong clearly noticed the battle qi within his meridians had grown thicker. Although the difference was not obvious, after circulating his battle qi a dozen times, the battle qi’s thickness increased by almost half the original density.

By the time Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, the gentle moonlight had dissipated and was replaced by a ray of sunlight streaming in through the window onto his small body.

Under the warm morning sun, Huang Xiaolong stretched lazily and got out of bed. During last night’s practice, not only did he experience a breakthrough and became a First Order Warrior, he actually reached mid-First Order.

“Mid-First Order.” Huang Xiaolong’s deep eyes watched the rising sun. According to this practice speed, within three days he would be able to reach late-First Order, perhaps even have another breakthrough and become a Second Order warrior!

Huang Xiaolong walked out from the room to the little yard, his small hands clenched into a fist. Gathering his battle qi in his fist, Huang Xiaolong punched towards a half-meter big rock at the corner of the small yard.

"Boom!" The sound of an explosion rang out and the half-meter big rock flew back and fell, rolling a few meters away. A corner of the rock crumbled into pieces and scattered on the ground.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the result and nodded his head in satisfaction. In general, a late-First Order warriors’ battle qi has the strength of one stone. While he was only at mid-First Order, because he trained in the Body Metamorphose Scripture, his attack power was comparable to a late-First Order warrior.

The power of one stone was calculated at one hundred and twenty pounds.

Huang Xiaolong also noticed after one night of practicing battle qi, the muscles in his body were stronger and more firm.

Warriors from the First to Third Order were grouped into the initial stages of cultivation. In this initial stage, as battle qi flows along the meridians, it refines the body’s muscles. By the time Huang Xiaolong reaches the pinnacle of Third Order warrior, his muscles will be fully developed, enhancing his reflexes, strength, and defense several times over compared to his current self.

At this moment, sounds of light footsteps could be heard from outside the yard. Huang Xiaolong was startled for a moment and then shook his head, smiling when he realized the visitor was his little sister, Huang Min.

Sure enough, Huang Min’s innocent, tender voice sounded: "Big Brother, Big Brother!

Huang Xiaolong turned around and saw Huang Min running into the yard. When she reached Huang Xiaolong, Huang Min was panting heavily: "Big brother, Mom and Dad are arguing.”

“Mom and Dad are arguing? What’s the matter?” Huang Xiaolong was confused for a moment. To his recollection, his parents had never quarreled.

"I don’t know the reason, but it seems it’s related to Eldest Uncle.” Huang Min said.

"Eldest Uncle?" Huang Xiaolong frowned slightly, saying: "We’ll go and see." Leaving the small courtyard with Huang Min, they hurried to the Eastern Courtyard. However, even before they reached the Eastern Courtyard’s hall, from some distance away, the sound of their parents quarreling echoed out.

"Big Brother is too much!" Su Yan’s anger filled voice exclaimed. “After the martial spirit awakening ceremony, all the children received a Battle Qi Dan except for our Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong’s pace halted.

Battle Qi Dan?− a second-grade pill. After awakening a martial spirit, if one could get a Battle Qi Dan, it would speed up battle qi conversion. Of course for warriors belonging to the initial stages, a Battle Qi Dan also aided in enhancing battle qi’s quality.

"Didn’t Big Brother already say the Manor’s supply of Battle Qi Dan just ran out? He will compensate Xiaolong next time.” Huang Peng’s irritated voice was heard coming from inside the hall.

“There was a total of twenty-six children during the martial spirit awakening ceremony and even those with low-level and waste martial spirits received a Battle Qi Dan. All others received one except for our Xiaolong who has a grade seven martial spirit!” Su Yan raised her voice in anger.

“Why is it so? Our Xiaolong is his nephew!”

Huang Xiaolong furrowed his brow. Listening to his parents’ quarrel, he understood clearly – other than him, all other children were given a Battle Qi Dan to aid their cultivation.

Two years ago, when Huang Xiaolong seriously beat up Huang Wei, Huang Ming did not say anything at the time. It seems Eldest Uncle Huang Ming’s resentment towards him had been stewing for a long while.

Although his grandfather Huang Qide had yet to pass the Manor Lord position to his Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, it was irrefutable that most matters of the manor were handled by him, especially in recent years. Just as his mother Su Yan said, even those with waste and low-level martial spirits were given a Battle Qi Dan. Only Huang Xiaolong, his nephew, did not get any. This was blatant bullying!

No matter what, Huang Xiaolong was Huang Ming’s nephew-- was it really necessary for Huang Ming to act so crudely?

Huang Ming’s action not only proved he resented Huang Xiaolong, it also equaled sweeping face for Huang Xiaolong’s parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, in front of all the Huang Clan Manor Elders.

"This cannot be. I’m going to ask Dad to judge the fairness of this matter!" Inside the hall, Su Yan discontentedly retorted for she was unable to swallow this down.

"You come back here!" Huang Peng shouted furiously, "For some small matter, you are going to trouble Father. Do you think that I haven’t lost enough face?”

Outside the hall, when Huang Xiaolong heard this, he silently turned to leave. A small matter, is it? A glint flashed across Huang Xiaolong eyes. His Uncle Huang Ming has yet to obtain the Manor Lord’s position, but once he has officially taken over, these types of small things will become much bigger!

Huang Min saw Huang Xiaolong remain silent, turning to leave without a word. She could not help but stand there in a daze for a moment before reacting. She tried to catch up to Huang Xiaolong: "Big Brother, Big Brother!”

Huang Xiaolong did not reply, the two of them left the Eastern Courtyard. Coincidentally, just as he stepped out they came face-to-face with Huang Wei. Trailing behind him was his usual gang of brothers, the same group that bullied Huang Min.

Seeing both Huang Xiaolong and his sister exiting the Eastern Courtyard, Huang Wei was startled for a moment before he stepped towards Huang Xiaolong with the group.

Note:

Sweeping/Slapping face- actions of insult.
