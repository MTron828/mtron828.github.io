The next scene rendered everyone dumbfounded.

Huang Xiaolong’s fist was akin to a giant chaos hammer, as he sent the sea tribe’s patrolling disciples flying high and far away, with every punch.

As for the little cow, she cheerfully swung her tail like a whip. Every strike of her tail sent a sea tribe’s patrolling disciple flying into the air. Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were both paralleled in sending the sea tribe’s patrolling disciples flying up into the air.

In the blink of an eye, the sea tribe’s patrol group of a hundred disciples was completely swept away by Huang Xiaolong and the little cow.

At one end of the street, the sea tribe’s patrol was sprawled in various postures. Many were crippled, and covered in blood while some had large holes in their bodies, and were grunting in pain.

The Golden Phoenix Pavilion and Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s disciples as well as the experts from other forces were astounded by the outcome.

The weakest of these sea tribe’s patrol disciples were at least Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, and the strongest were at least early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm. In between, there were a lot of Ninth Order Ancient God Realm disciples, but unbelievably Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had dealt with them easily!

But Huang Xiaolong is merely a peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm ah.

Huang Xiaolong, who is merely a peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm has actually crippled an early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm sea tribe’s disciple!

For a moment, no one made a sound. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As the Golden Phoenix Pavilion and Black Region’s Fortune Gate’s disciples’ shock receded, they felt the atmosphere turn icy cold.

Whereas Guo Gang, and the Guo Family’s guards were slightly ashend, and their arrogance from earlier had completely disappeared, especially Guo Gang’s. His eyes were wide in disbelief, but more so from terror.

Huang Xiaolong did not pay attention to the crowd’s expressions as he walked towards Guo Gang.

“Huang, Xiaolong!” Guo Gang stepped back fearfully, “I’m...” Although he was in a denial that Huang Xiaolong would not dare to attack him in the Sea God City, he still couldn’t help being afraid.

But, before Guo Gang could utter another word, Huang Xiaolong clenched his jaw, and squeezed his mouth into a shape of an ‘o’.

Terror and anger were intermingled in Guo Gang’s eyes as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. Never had he imagined that Huang Xiaolong would really dare to touch him in the Sea God City!

“I know that you are Guo Family’s core disciple Guo Gang, and your father is Guo Jin.” Huang Xiaolong added coldly, “My memory is not that bad that I need your reminder.”

Huang Xiaolong’s words were clearly heard by Guo Gang and his guards, along with Golden Phoenix Pavilion, Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s disciples, as well as other world surfaces sects’ experts!”

"Huang Xiaolong, release our Young Lord immediately!"

"How dare you lay a hand on our Young Lord in Sea God City! You’re going to pay for this... you’re dead!" A Guo Family’s guard emphasized that Huang Xiaolong would pay for his action to vent his anger, and to reiterate the severe consequences of his actions.

As the Guo Family’s guard had said, attacking someone with Guo Gang’s status and identity in Sea God City could only lead to dire consequences.

“I’m dead?”The corners of Huang Xiaolong’s lips curved into a faint smile as he exerted force on Guo Gang’s chin. Guo Gang shrieked like a pig being slaughter.

Huang Xiaolong had crushed all of Guo Gang’s teeth.

Guo Gang’s inhuman scream sent cold shivers down Guo Family’s guards, but they were also enraged at the same time.

“Stop!”

“Stop right now!”

All the Guo Family’s guards drew their swords, slashing and thrusting at Huang Xiaolong.

Despite being wary of Huang Xiaolong’s startling strength, they couldn’t care to think of it right now. It was crucial for them to swiftly save Young Lord Guo Gang from Huang Xiaolong’s grasp, otherwise, they would die more miserably.

Huang Xiaolong ignored these Guo Family’s guards’ attacks and punched Guo Gang’s chest with his other fist. Guo Gang’s chest caved-in from the force from Huang Xiaolong’s punch.

In a split second, others saw multiple Guo Family guards’ swords slash on various parts of Huang Xiaolong’s flesh.

Watching this, Guo Gang endured the pain in his chest and roared, "Huang Xiaolong, your death has arrived! Kill him!"

But to his horror, Huang Xiaolong repelled all of the guards in front of his eyes. Not to mention, there wasn’t a single scratch of Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The experts in the crowd were just as shocked.

This was mainly because they could see that Huang Xiaolong was not wearing some wondrous ancient divine armor, and his robe was made from common cloth, nor had he defended with his godforce. Not to mention the swords used by the Guo Family’s guards were forged by the Guo Family using a rare iron and a secret forging method. These swords were sharp enough to split even a mountain.

But Huang Xiaolong had remained unhurt!

How strong was Huang Xiaolong’s flesh exactly?

At this point, a cloud of lightning struck down like a thunderstorm from above them. Guo Family’s guards were all sent flying, as smoke curled out from their bodies as they crashed to the ground.

"Presumptuous! A mere Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, dares to be insolent in my Sea God City!" Suddenly, a sonorous voice reverberated from afar like rumbling thunder, shaking the city.

Experts in the Sea God City looked up fearfully.

A finger force pierced through the air, reaching Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye.

The finger force seemed calm and quiet, but Huang Xiaolong felt danger and death from it.

On top of that, Huang Xiaolong discovered that he couldn’t move at all. This feeling reminded Huang Xiaolong of the time he had encountered Xiao Family’s Ancestor in Xiao City.

’Is it a sea tribe’s Ancestor generation? Or a Patriarch from the twelve prominent families?’

As the finger force was about to piercing through Huang Xiaolong’s body, a golden sword qi appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong. The golden sword qi quivered for a second, and the finger force was scattered without a trace.

The crowd was stunned.

Space rippled as Guo Family’s Patriarch Guo Shi and several Guo Family’s Grand Elders appeared on the street.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor also appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Golden Brow Ancestor calmly said to Patriarch Guo Shi, "Guo Shi, it’s just some scuffles between the juniors. Attacking a junior, despite being an elder and Guo Family’s Patriarch is a bit too much."

In the meantime, a Guo Family’s Grand Elder ran towards Guo Gang’s side and began healing him.

Guo Shi gave a fake smile as he said, "Senior Golden Brow is joking, I had no ill-will just now. I was just too happy seeing a talent like Huang Xiaolong, therefore I merely wanted to give him some guidance."

Golden Brow Ancestor calmly retorted, "In that case, we should say thank you to you..."

The smile on Guo Shi’s face did not falter as he spoke, "The God of the Sea Grand Ceremony is just days away, I also hope that Senior Golden Brow and Senior Blood Knife would not interfere in the competition between juniors when the time comes."

“No need to trouble Patriarch Guo to remind us of this.” Golden Brow Ancestor said. With that said, Golden Brow Ancestor took Huang Xiaolong and the little cow away with a Great Space Teleportation. Blood Knife Ancestor followed as well.

“Patriarch, we’re letting them leave just like this?” Asked a Guo Family’s Grand Elder.

A cold light gleamed in Guo Shi’s eyes as he answered, “Let them leave. Wait until the day of the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, I’ll let them know what’s bitterness!” Of course, Golden Brow’s strength had made him apprehensive to go against Huang Xiaolong any further. He was not confident that he could delay Golden Brow.

Guo Shi frowned as he looked in the direction Golden Brow had disappeared, ‘This Golden Brow, has probably broken through to the realm that their Guo Family’s Ancestor had mentioned...’
