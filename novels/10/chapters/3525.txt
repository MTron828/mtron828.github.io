Chapter 3526: Envoy of the Dark Shadow Race

When they heard how Wang Yi described the Dark Shadow Race, Huang Xiaolong, Ao Guang, and Ao Shenghai couldn’t help but snicker.

A weird expression formed on Wang Yi’s face when he saw their reaction. “Naturally, they are nothing to experts like yourselves.”

Indeed. The Dark Shadow Race was nothing to Huang Xiaolong and the others. However, they were an insurmountable mountain to the members of the Fantasy Butterfly Race. One had to know that the Fantasy Butterfly Race didn’t possess a single high-level Dao Venerable.

Several days later…

Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at the territory of the Fantasy Butterfly Race.

They were currently located on a mountain range that was named the Resurgence Mountain Range by one of their earlier ancestors. The meaning was clear enough. He wished for the Fantasy Butterfly Race to rise once again.

Looking around, they saw countless disciples training hard. They lived their lives in peace, and the atmosphere was tranquil.

Seeing the four newcomers, along with their patriarch’s respectful behavior towards them, the disciples were shocked.

However, an eminent elder quickly approached and bowed to Wang Yi. “Patriarch, this…”

Wang Yi quickly turned to Wang Meiqi.

“Gather the Dao Venerables in the main hall,” Wang Meiqi muttered.

“Yes, Lord Ancestor!” 

The doyen was shocked, and he looked at Wang Meiqi, “Lord Ancestor?” 

Wang Meiqi didn’t bother with the doyen as Wang Yi brought them all to the main hall.

When they arrived, Wang Meiqi asked, “Did the previous patriarch build the main hall?’

The hall didn’t differ much from the main hall back in the original location of the Fantasy Butterfly Race. Wang Meiqi nearly mistook the place for the original main hall.

“Yes. Our old patriarch used a ton of resources to build the main hall following the one that was destroyed in the past,” Wang Yi explained. “However, there are some slight differences.”

Wang Meiqi nodded.

When they received Wang Yi’s summons, the eminent elders in the Dao Venerable Realm quickly gathered in the main hall. That included the previous patriarch of the race, Wang Xinming.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Wang Yi, did something happen for you to gather us here?” Wang Xinming asked. “Did the Dark Shadow Race send another envoy?” A look of hatred flashed in his eyes when he looked at Huang Xiaolong and the others.

Wang Yi explained in haste when he saw the look on Wang Xinming’s face. “No, no, no! Old patriarch, this is our Lord Ancestor!” 

“Lord Ancestor?!” More than twenty people present in the hall gasped in shock.

“Wang Yi, what a joke! Since you’re the patriarch, don’t you know how serious it is for someone to impersonate Lord Ancestor?!” a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable growled.

The person who just spoke was an eminent elder of the race, Wang Ce.

Wang Ce and Wang Yi had always been at odds, and they vied for the position of the patriarch. The old patriarch, Wang Xinming, decided to give the position to Wang Yi despite his lower cultivation realm, and Wang Ce had been indignant about it ever since.

The experts of the race stared at Wang Meiqi when they realized that she was the person Wang Yi referred to. They didn’t believe him at all, and no one could blame them. After all, none of them knew that there was an ancestor who survived the previous massacre.

Not even Wang Xinming believed Wang Yi.

Panicking, Wang Yi wanted to say something but he was interrupted by Wang Meiqi.

Ten wings appeared behind her all of a sudden, and blinding rays of light showed into the skies. It covered the mountain range, and the entire area was engulfed in multi-colored lights.

Like Wang Yi, everyone felt their bloodline faintly suppressed and all of them were shocked.

Wang Xinming and the others revealed a trace of reverence when they saw the ten wings behind Wang Meiqi.

They fell to their knees instantly, and Wang Ce revealed a terrified expression. He didn’t expect to offend their Lord Ancestor, and he apologized profusely.

She didn’t blame him, and she quickly allowed them to rise. She introduced Huang Xiaolong and the others, and the members of the Fantasy Butterfly Race greeted them respectfully.

“Lord Patriarch, an envoy from the Dark Shadow Race is here!” an elder of the race barged into the hall and reported in haste.

Wang Xinming and the others were taken aback.

“He said that if we refuse to hand over the grand dao spiritual veins, he’ll bring his troops and exterminate our race!” the elder continued.

“The Dark Shadow Race is going too far!” Wang Xinming and the others growled in anger.

The Dark Shadow Race was a super race, but it wouldn’t be easy for them to take out two grand dao spiritual veins, much less a race like the Fantasy Butterfly Race!

“Your Highness, Lord Ancestor, do you think…” Wang Yi turned to Wang Meiqi.

Wang Meiqi looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Chuckling softly, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Let’s go meet the envoy.”

Under Wang Yi’s lead, they left the main hall.

Along the way, Wang Yi spoke about the reason behind the Dark Shadow Race’s obsession over spiritual veins. There were core disciples of the Dark Shadow Race who were killed and they pinned the blame on the Fantasy Butterfly Race. As such, they were requesting two grand dao spiritual veins as compensation.

Huang Xiaolong and the others saw the envoy in the distance, and they saw he was followed by several hundred disciples of the Dark Shadow Race. All of them were experts in the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm or above, and the envoy was a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable.

They were soon noticed by the party sent by the Dark Shadow Race. A look of surprise appeared on the envoy’s face, but he quickly turned to look at Wang Meiqi.

It went without saying that his gaze was attracted to the pretty lady before him.

Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived in front of the group, and they were greeted with an outburst. 

“Are you the people recruited by the Fantasy Butterfly Race? You better not interfere in this. Otherwise, you might offend some people you cannot afford to offend! You’ll only be creating trouble for yourself!” The envoy frowned.

“Creating trouble for myself?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled, and Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang roared with laughter.

When the envoy heard them, his expression sank. “What are you laughing at?!”

Without any of them moving a muscle, the envoy of the Dark Shadow Race started to fly towards the members of the Fantasy Butterfly Race. 

A look of fear appeared on his face when he realized that the energy in his body was sealed.

“Lord Envoy!” The experts of the Dark Shadow Race finally reacted. When they were about to charge at Huang Xiaolong and the others, they realized that they couldn’t move a muscle.
