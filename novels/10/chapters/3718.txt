Chapter 3719: Dazzling Black Race

“Why do you need to locate the White Deer?” Huang Xiaolong asked. “The White Deer isn’t a creature you can meet as you wish. Even if you did run into it, you might not be able to capture it.”

If one could find the White Deer easily, a lot more people would have seen it.

Also, there wasn’t anyone who could capture the creature.

Experts from the Universe First Race tried time and time again, only to return empty-handed every time.

Yang Dingsheng’s voice turned sullen, and he sighed, “My wife was seriously injured by someone in the past. Her physical body was shattered and her dao heart was destroyed. Not even her dao soul could remain intact.”

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. That would make her no different from a corpse!

“All these years, I tried countless ways to save her… I heard that the bloodline of the White Deer has the ability of rebirth and I’m here to try that.”

Even though he knew that the chances of locating the White Deer were slim to none, he wanted to try his luck.

Huang Xiaolong could tell how much he loved his wife, and he clapped Yang Dingsheng’s shoulder and comforted, “Brother Yang, you can rest assured that I’ll follow you on your journey to locate the White Deer. We’ll definitely be able to find it.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but think about his wives. The figures of Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others flashed through his mind.

Yang Dingsheng revealed a comforted look and thanked Huang Xiaolong, “Brother Huang, I am extremely heartened by your intentions. However, looking for the White Deer won’t be easy. I do not wish to distract you.”

“It’s alright. Even if we have to turn the White Deer Cave upside down, we’ll find it. It won’t take long for us to look through the entire area anyway.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hands casually.

That was an exaggeration. The White Deer Cave was massive and it was comparable to the Universe Vault in size. It wouldn’t be easy to look through the entire area.

Not to mention the fact that they might not locate the White Deer. The Universe First Race turned the place upside down in the past but failed to see its shadow! It wasn’t an object that would remain quietly in place for someone to find it. The White Deer could escape to any corner of the White Deer Cave in order to escape detection!

The White Deer’s strength was also known to the universes. It was no weakling! It was basically unbeatable as long as they remained in the White Deer Cave!

Yang Dingsheng felt a trace of hope burning in his heart after hearing what Huang Xiaolong said.

“Oh? Isn’t this old man Yang Dingsheng?” A voice rang through the skies.

Even though he wasn’t loud, his voice was extremely annoying to the ears.

Huang Xiaolong turned around to see three figures soaring across the skies as they rode on demonic beasts.

The demonic beasts were called Black Demons and they were extremely terrifying existences. They were born with the ability to control darkness, and their speed when traveling in the dark was faster than anyone could imagine.

Yang Dingsheng’s expression changed slightly when he saw the newcomers.

“They’re from the Dazzling Black Race.”

The three of them quickly arrived before the duo.

“Yang Dingsheng, are you also here for the fourteenth universe treasure?” The person in the lead sneered, “The old ancestor and patriarch of your race didn’t come because they know their place. You should know better as an ancient ancestor of your race! You better leave this place when you can and run back to your Yang Lightning Race… If a fight breaks out, I might cripple you with a single punch!”

The two experts behind him roared with laughter.

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face but a hand held him back when he wanted to approach the three. Yang Dingsheng shook his head slowly.

“Brat, what do you think you’re doing?” The middle-aged man leading the trio snorted when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s actions.

Cupping his fists, Yang Dingsheng sighed, “Brother Huang failed to recognize Brother Cao Cheng. I hope you can forgive him.”

Cao Cheng tilted his head upwards and sneered, “Brat, I’ll forgive you because of Yang Dingsheng. If this happens again, I’ll cripple you!”

After he spoke, he tore through the air with the two experts following behind him.

After Cao Cheng had left, Yang Dingsheng heaved a sigh of relief and explained, “Brother Huang, you were too rash.”

“It’s just the Dazzling Black Race… They’re nothing but ants.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

A bitter smile appeared on Yang Dingsheng’s face when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “You probably don’t know them. You should know that they remained hidden for a long time. Not many people in the Thirteen Universes know about them. The ancient ancestor of the Dazzling Black Race is an expert with 25 billion units of combat strength!”

“Even if the old ancestor of our race meets the old ancestor of the Dazzling Black Race, he will have to lower his head. Cao Cheng is an expert who has broken through the 20 billion mark and I won’t be able to protect you if he makes a move on you!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the serious look on Yang Dingsheng’s face. “Is that so? If you didn’t hold me back, I would have crippled him with a single punch.”

With his eyes widening in shock, Yang Dingsheng shook his head. “Alright, let’s go take a look. We’ll go look for the White Deer. If we’re lucky, we’ll be able to find the treasure too!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

The two of them traveled deeper into the White Deer Cave.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle. As they went deeper, Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls in order to look for the White Feather King and the Universe Source Stone.

As the Universe Source Stone was created during the formation of the universes, not even people like the Ferocious Devil or the White Feather King would be able to detect it easily. Luckily for Huang Xiaolong, he had the Universe Boat, Nameless Devil Mirror, and the Universe Transformation Art. It was much easier for him to detect traces of the Universe Source Stone.

Several dozen days passed in an instant.

The only creatures they ran into were the monsters that lived in the White Deer Cave. With their strength, they dealt with the threat easily.

Other than the creatures, they ran into several experts who were there to search for the treasure. As Yang Dingsheng knew all of them, no fights broke out. Everyone went their separate ways.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When they saw a giant continent floating in the space before them, Yang Dingsheng suggested, “Brother Huang, let’s go take a look.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded and the two of them flew towards the land mass. Even with his dao souls, he couldn’t detect the end of it.

The moment he stepped foot onto the continent, Huang Xiaolong felt a strange feeling that came from deep within the land.

Yang Dingsheng might not be able to discover the strangeness of the continent, but Huang Xiaolong was an existence close to the Universe God Realm!

They slowly made their way forward.

“Strange… There are many fierce creatures in the other parts of the White Deer Cave. Why isn’t there a single one here?” Yang Dingsheng asked.

A chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Probably because it’s the territory of some terrifying existence.”

?!

Taking out a spiritual vein from the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong allowed it to hover in the air before him.
