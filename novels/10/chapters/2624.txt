Chapter 2625: Finally Emerging

Zi Yutong looked at the magnificent rays of light in the skies, and her chest heaved up and down.

Soon after, her face started to turn deathly pale. If Huang Xiaolong really managed to comprehend all ten thousand dao laws, wouldn’t that mean…?

It was undeniable that Zi Yutong exuded a different type of charm, and anyone who saw her panicked look would pity her. However, things were different this time. No one paid attention to her and they stared at the skies above the Dao Gate, afraid that they would miss a once in a lifetime miracle.

Yuan Qianxing, who was extremely relaxed, clenched his fists to the point his knuckles flashed white. Terrifying light burst forth from his eyes.

He stared at the void stubbornly, as if he was willing Huang Xiaolong to fail at the final step.

Of course, a method as stupid as that would never work. Yuan Qianxing could only stare at it from afar.

The disciples from the three races who held grudges with Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of helplessness swallowing their hearts, and anger threatened to overwhelm them.

Long Shengtian's original worry quickly turned into joy as a brilliant smile blossomed on his face. If anyone could see Long Shengtian as he was, they would realize that the weird old man was actually pretty damn handsome!

Even Yin Zhangguo’s appearance couldn’t be compared to the vice mansion master of the Otherworldly Mansion!

“He finally comprehended the last dao law!” Feitian Longpeng laughed happily. He wasn’t jealous or envious of Huang Xiaolong, but instead, joy filled his heart. He was happy for the future of the Otherworldly Mansion, and the person who could finally comprehend all ten thousand dao laws in the Dao Gate had finally appeared!

“Nice! Huang Xiaolong outdid himself this time!” Feng Tianwei laughed out loudly.

Even though Feng Jiu was stunned, a slight smile managed to form on her face.

The disciples of the Purple Spider Race released the excitement in their hearts as they roared towards the heavens.

“Our Young Patriarch comprehended all ten thousand dao laws!”

“Our Young Patriarch will become a mansion master candidate! Waahaha!”

The humans were no different.

When Chen Muguang stared at the skies above the Dao Gate, his expression sank. “How can this be?! How can a human actually comprehend all ten thousand dao laws?!”

When he cursed in his heart, he seemed to have forgotten that he was also a human… Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When the experts of the human race saw how dispirited Chen Muguang was, the respect for him died in their hearts. Only disgust and contempt were left, and they shook their heads inwardly.

The dazzling light illuminated the Otherworldly Mansion, and the various regions around it.

When the outside world was buzzing with different emotions, Huang Xiaolong was sitting under the Dao Gate as rays of light poured into his body. All ten thousand dao laws swirled around him, and they shrouded him in mythical light.

A mysterious power flooded his body all of a sudden, and a terrifying power started to awaken in his veins!

Dao origin energy!

That was something every expert in the Alien Lands dreamed of wielding! The Dao Gate had accumulated a frightening amount of dao origin energy over the billions of years, and even medicinal pills of the highest grades wouldn’t be able to compare to the power that was flowing into Huang Xiaolong’s body!

Even if he swallowed ten thousand holy pills at once, the energy he consumed would be like a drop of water in the sea when compared to the energy contained in the Dao Gate!

As the energy surged through every inch of Huang Xiaolong’s body, his godheads, holy souls, and inextinguishable dao heart received endless benefits.

When more and more energy poured into his dao heart, resplendent rays of light started to emerge.

As for his holy souls, they started their transformation towards dao souls. When all the holy energy in them was converted to grand dao energy, they would finally complete their transformations!

The power of the dao heart could destroy a holy soul, but a dao soul was a truly indestructible presence!

With the help of the dao origin energy contained in the Dao Gate, Huang Xiaolong quickly reached the peak of the early-Second Heaven True Saint Realm. As he continued to cultivate, he entered the mid-Second Heaven True Saint Realm after one short year.

After breaking through to the mid-Second Heaven True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong continued to cultivate diligently.

After six whole years of cultivation, it was close to the ten-years mark since Huang Xiaolong had entered the Dao Gates. He reached the peak of the late-Second Heaven True Saint Realm and everyone standing outside the Dao Gate eagerly awaited his reappearance.

“It’s been so long since he comprehended the dao laws! How can he still remain in the Dao Gate?!” Several disciples started whispering to themselves. “Did something happen when he tried to harmonize with the dao origin energy?”

“It’s hard to say… It’s like when someone obtains an inheritance. There’s a chance an accident might occur at the end, and he would fail to receive anything,” someone else speculated.

“Nobody knows how strong the dao origin energy contained in the Dao Gate is! Not to mention the fact that Huang Xiaolong is only a Second Heaven True Saint… There’s a high chance he could have failed to withstand the sudden surge in energy!”

“That’s right, maybe Huang Xiaolong is facing the backlash of the dao origin energy! Hahaha! Legend has it that the backlash would be able to slay even peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saints!”

The members of the three races started to jeer as they hoped for something bad to happen to Huang Xiaolong.

Yin Zhangguo frowned.

…

More than eleven months passed.

When there were ten minutes left until the deadline of ten years, Yuan Wangfeng whispered into Yuan Qianxing’s ears, “Young Master, did something happen to Huang Xiaolong when he was absorbing the dao origin energy?”

As an expert himself, he didn’t believe the explanation from random members of the Myriad Origin Race. However, there were only ten more minutes till the ten-years mark, and he couldn’t help but allow his imagination to run wild.

Yuan Qianxing stared at the Dao Gate, and his expression remained sombre.

Nine minutes, eight minutes… Three minutes!

Many people turned to look at each other.

“Young Patriarch, could he…?!” one of the disciples from the Purple Spider Race felt the blood draining from his face, and he muttered.

“Huang… Huang Xiaolong! That’s Huang Xiaolong!” A yell broke everyone out from their delusions, and they turned to stare at the entrance of the Dao Gate.

A shadowy figure started to walk towards them, and as the only person had entered the Dao Gate ten years ago, there was only a single possibility.

Huang Xiaolong!

Yin Zhangguo, Feng Jiu, and the others heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that Huang Xiaolong had finally emerged from the Dao Gate!

As soon as he emerged, a cold flash entered Yuan Qianxing’s eyes. Killing intent surged through his heart, and just as he was about to make his move, another figure appeared in front of him. The figure who blocked him started to walk towards Huang Xiaolong.

Realizing it was none other than Long Shengtian, Yuan Qianxing could only curse silently in his heart.

Tightening his fists, Yuan Qianxing thought of many possibilities, but he eventually decided against doing anything stupid. He glared at Long Shengtian’s back and a trace of rage formed in his heart.

As soon as I enter the Primal Ancestor Realm, I’ll deal with this b*stard, who keeps ruining my plans!

Other people were probably no match for Long Shengtian at the First Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, but Long Shengtian was different! He had the Origin Saint Godhead, and he was a lot stronger than ordinary experts at the same level!
