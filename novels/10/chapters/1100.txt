This ape-like arm also slammed down on Cao Weiran the instant it appeared.

To Cao Weiran’s horror, the second ape arm was more terrifying than the first! A lot more!

A horrifying destructive palm force exuding nefarious energy slammed onto his back. Cao Weiran had no time to think; without even looking back, his palm struck at the attacker.

Rumble~!

Resounding blasts rang like neverending divine punishment lightning.

The one hundred beasts occupying the mountain were alerted, all of them looked fearfully in the direction of the mountain slope. Demonic beasts that were closer in proximity to the slope were spitting blood again and again, their bodies continuously trembling after being impacted by the overwhelming shockwaves.

Even though these demonic beasts were strong, most of them were between late-Tenth Order and peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm.

Even the three most powerful demonic beasts on this mountain were only between early and mid-First Order Ancient God Realm.

Cao Weiran’s body shot forward, savagely crashed into the rocky mountain surface. The mountain shook, raising a thick curtain of dust and sand.

Cao Weiran ignored his heavy injuries, staring at the two stalwart figures looming over him in the air.

“Ancient God Realm Nefarious Devil masters!” He screamed. Furthermore, one could be a late-Second Order Ancient God Realm master while the other, an early Third Order Ancient God Realm master!

‘Impossible!’

How could two Ancient God Realm Nefarious Devil masters leave the Nefarious Devil Island?

High in the air, Xie Tu and Xie Du were respectfully saluting at Huang Xiaolong, “Master.”

Master!

Cao Weiran’s head buzzed as if a thunderbolt struck him, ‘This, this, this..!!’

Two Second Order and above Ancient God Realm masters actually addressed a late-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm young man ’Master’?!

’That means...!’ Cao Weiran’s gaze fell on the Green Ice Hail Devil Bing Jiuyi standing beside Huang Xiaolong, ‘That Green Ice Hail Devil is the same?’

When Bing Jiuyi first appeared, Cao Weiran had assumed he was just a hired help to protect Huang Xiaolong, while Huang Xiaolong was just paying for a service.

In the Divine World, if the price offered was high enough, a person could indeed hire an Ancient God Realm master to protect them for a certain period of time.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Cao Weiran, saying, “Cao Weiran, the treasure map.” as his right hand extended out.

Enduring the pain from his injuries, Cao Weiran struggled to stand straight. When Huang Xiaolong first spoke his full name, he had thought this weak little kid wasn’t qualified to speak to him, but now, he didn’t think so anymore.

’However, you want to take away my Ancestral Dragon Fruit treasure map?’

A gloomy light flickered in Cao Weiran’s eyes as his gaze swept over Xie Tu, Xie Du, and Bing Jiuyi.

“Fine, I can give you the Ancestral Dragon Fruit treasure map, but you must promise to let me go.” Cao Weiran negotiated after struggling internally.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, stating matter-of-factly, “You aren’t qualified to negotiate terms with me.”

Not qualified!

Anger raged in Cao Weiran’s heart. How many years had it been? This was the first time someone said to his face that he was not qualified.

“What do you want then?” Cao Weiran forcefully suppressed the raging fire in his chest, half snarling, “Don’t go overboard! If I destroy this treasure map, neither of us will get it.”

“The map, I want, and you also need to make a blood oath of one hundred years of allegiance to me.” Huang Xiaolong said coldly.

“What, blood oath?!” Cao Weiran’s angry bellow resounded.

Once someone violated a blood oath they made, they would suffer divine punishment, therefore Cao Weiran would be bound to Huang Xiaolong for a hundred years.

In fact, this was the only method Huang Xiaolong could think of in the lack of other options.

Indeed, with Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du’s strength, they could capture Cao Weiran, however, Cao Weiran himself was a Second Order Ancient God Realm master with a strong will, it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to control him as he did with Bing Jiuyi and the rest.

Therefore, he could only attempt to control Cao Weiran through the blood oath.

Although a blood oath couldn’t ensure that Cao Weiran would be completely loyal to him, it was a method to control him to some extent and make him listen to his orders for a hundred years.

Huang Xiaolong was confident he would have already broken through to the Ancient God Realm a hundred years later, branding Cao Weiran’s godhead at that time wouldn’t be late.

Huang Xiaolong calmly watched Cao Weiran seethe with anger, waiting for his reply.

Between dying and a blood oath, Huang Xiaolong believed Cao Weiran would make the right decision.

As Huang Xiaolong expected, the enraged Cao Weiran gradually calmed down, and after some thought, he nodded in the end.

When he was finished, his blood oath formed two sigils that flew into Huang Xiaolong and Cao Weiran’s own forehead separately. Sensing the existence of the blood sigil inside his body, Cao Weiran sighed heavily in his heart. He then passed the Ancestral Dragon Fruit treasure map over to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong took the treasure map, looked over it, then compared with the surrounding mountainous terrain. There was doubt in his eyes.

According to the indication on the map, the Ancestral Dragon Fruit should be somewhere in this open space.

“The Ancestral Dragon Fruit is certain to be around here!” The little cow suddenly spoke.

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement. He moved to the center of the open space where two faint handprints could be seen on the ground, which was caused by Cao Weiran earlier.

Looking at the two palm prints, Huang Xiaolong was inwardly shocked. For an early Second Order Ancient God Realm to barely leave any marks on the ground surface, how hard was this ground?

Huang Xiaolong pondered briefly, then instructed the little cow and the others to move further back, having Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du simultaneously attack the same spot. Yet the ground merely quivered, not even a small crack appeared!

Huang Xiaolong subsequently thought of various methods and tried them one by one to no avail.

“This place must have been tampered with by some ancient master. Breaking the ground surface is unlikely unless you have a Seventh Order Ancient God Realm strength.” The little cow summarized, tiny purple sparks crackling on its two golden horns.

Disappointment was written all over Huang Xiaolong’s face at the little cow’s words.

Seventh Order Ancient God Realm!

It seems he wouldn’t be able to find the Ancestral Dragon Fruit until then.

Although he still wasn’t absolutely certain that the Ancestral Dragon Fruit was below this part of the mountain, there was a ninety percent chance it was! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, who arranged these formations around here? Could it be that ancient divine beast Blood Phoenix?

Huang Xiaolong looked at his surroundings. Failing to find any clues, he could only leave the Blood Phoenix Forest. Before leaving, though, he subjugated the most powerful demonic beast on the Hundred Beasts Summit, the Nether Fire Sparrow.

A month later, his group was out from the Blood Phoenix Forest territory. From here on, Huang Xiaolong decided to make a trip back to the Barbarian God Sect, whereas Cao Weiran, Wei Chao, the Three Evils, and the rest were allowed to return to the Berserk Lion Sect. Huang Xialong did not forget to give them a list of the herbs he needed.

Since he was in no hurry to rush back to the Barbarian God Sect, Huang Xiaolong trained as he traveled. By the time he reached the sect, three months had passed. During this period of training, his cultivation made a great leap toward peak late-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm.

“I heard Senior Brother Chen Hao went to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield to train. In a short time, his strength improved by leaps and bounds, and now he’s close to breaking through to Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm!”

“I heard that too. Not only that, at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, Senior Brother Chen Hao received the appreciation of the Giant Tribe Patriarch, who wanted to accept Senior Brother Chen Hao as his godson.”

“The Giant Tribe Patriarch is a Third Order Ancient God Realm master!”

Huang Xiaolong had just returned to the Barbarian God Sect and he already heard quite a few disciples discussing Chen Hao’s latest adventure.
