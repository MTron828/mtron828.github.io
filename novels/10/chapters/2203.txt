Chapter 2204: Arriving at the Holy World

Before long, Huang Xiaolong located Feng Tianyu. At the same time, Feng Tianyu was flying towards Huang Xiaolong with a relieved expression on his face.

Just as the two of them were about to meet, a massive bolt of lightning slammed into the space between them and separated the two of them.

Under the shocking impact of the lightning bolt, Hung Xiaolong was sent flying thousands of miles away even with the protection of the lightning bead and the four divine fires. By the time he stabilized himself, Feng Tianyu was nowhere to be seen. Regardless of how loudly he screamed, there was no reply.

No matter how hard Huang Xiaolong tried to search for Feng Tianyu, he failed.

In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong tried his hardest to move forward in the sea of lightning. He used the lightning bead and four great divine fires to surround himself as he forced his way forward.

Despite that, the strength of the lightning bolts in the spatial vortex overwhelmed him. Even the weakest bolt had the ability to kill a peak-late Tenth Order Sovereign. The strongest attack was comparable to an all-out attack from a First Order Venerable!

The deeper Huang Xiaolong went, the stronger the lightning bolts. Even with the lightning bead and four great divine fires, Huang Xiaolong felt as though he was about to be blown apart.

The glow around the lightning bead started to fade, and the four great divine fires began to dim.

No matter how strong the offensive capabilities of the four great divine fires, they weren’t good at defending.

As for the lightning bead, Huang Xiaolong had failed to restore it even after a thousand years of effort. At his current level, a saint artifact wasn’t something Huang Xiaolong could fix even if he wanted to.

After several more days of protection, the lightning bead and divine fires exhausted themselves. With no choice left, Huang Xiaolong recalled them and activated his saint bloodlines to resist the impact of the lightning.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong succeeded in withstanding the lightning storm. However, the lightning slowly started to increase in strength, and Huang Xiaolong felt as though his body was about to explode.

The terrifying lightning tore apart his defenses and struck at his body directly. His veins and meridians tore in the face of the frightening bolts of lightning.

His body was like a piece of shattered glass as streaks of blood streamed down his skin.

When things seemed bleak, Huang Xiaolong had no choice but to transform into the Primordial Blue Divine Dragon in order to defend himself. It was too bad it wasn’t enough as the horrifying bolts of lightning tore apart everything in their path.

The scales on Huang Xiaolong’s body shattered one by one, and a burnt smell filled the space around him.

Even if he wanted to use all his strength to activate his tenth layer Grandmist Parasitic Medium, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to withstand the lightning storm.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a weakling either. No matter how the lightning tried to attack and overwhelm him, his three complete dao saint godheads remained bright as his soul burned with everlasting brightness.

Not stopping for a second, Huang Xiaolong forced his way through the spatial vortex. He knew that there was no way for him to return now, and advancing was the only thing he could do.

He could only live was if he passed through the lightning storm to arrive in the Holy World. If he stopped for even a second, there was no doubt he would die.

Throughout the journey, he had already lost count of how many spiritual pills he had consumed. Eventually, he lost track of time. Twenty days passed without him knowing it, and a trace of golden light finally appeared in front of him.

Huang Xiaolong was startled at first, but his surprise soon transformed into joy as he moved towards his new target, the golden light, with all his might.

Just as he was about to arrive at the golden light, a blast of lightning slammed into him with unimaginable force. The last thing Huang Xiaolong felt was a jolt running through his mind before his vision went dark.

The moment he lost consciousness, Huang Xiaolong felt his body become lighter as if he was free-falling.

Crashing into the ground, Huang Xiaolong remained motionless as he fell into a deep slumber.

A few days later...

A group of convoys appeared from afar.

There were approximately three to four hundred people in the group, and each carriage carried the insignia of a fire lion’s head. The guards were riding on the same type of divine beast and it was clear that they weren’t a force to be trifled with.

Be it the decorations on the carriage, or the Dragon Horse Divine Beasts the guards were riding, it was clear they belonged to a proper force.

However, they stopped all of a sudden when they arrived at the spot where Huang Xiaolong lay.

“What’s the matter?” In the main carriage, a beautiful and charming voice rang through the air.

“Princess, an unconscious man is lying on the ground. He seems to have sustained serious injuries!” A maid who held a sword in her hand arrived beside the main carriage and reported respectfully.

“What do you mean?” The curtains were pulled open and the appearance of a gorgeous lady was shown to the world. She quickly emerged from the carriage with the help of the maid.

“Princess, you must be careful!” One of the guards who was standing at the side yelled when he noticed the princess’ actions.

However, she waved her hand and brushed him off. “There’s no need to worry.” With light footsteps, she made her way towards the unconscious man at the side of the road.

Since the person was lying flat on his stomach, the guards at the side quickly approached to flip him over. They were shocked when they realized the extent of his injuries. He was covered in blood, and he looked like a horrifying beast who had emerged from hell.

After the chief guard confirmed that Huang Xiaolong was unconscious, he stepped forward and started examining his injuries. The more he checked, the greater the shock he received. He quickly completed his diagnosis, and he reported, “Princess, the injuries on his body are extremely serious! His meridians are destroyed, and his internal organs are ruptured! Even his spirit sea has been shattered! Even with his serious injuries, he’s alive!”

Everyone stared at the captain in shock.

How could someone with a shattered spirit sea, ruptured organs, and destroyed meridians be alive?!

The princess took several steps forward to look at Huang Xiaolong’s blood-stained face before taking out a spiritual pill.

“Princess, are you planning on using the Resurrection Pill to save this person? Even if it works, he will be crippled!” The guard captain, Bai Yan, advised.

The Resurrection Pill was a supremely precious pill. According to him, there was absolutely no point in wasting it on the person blocking their way.

“That’s right! Princess, we have no idea who this person is and where he comes from. For all we know, he might be trying to cheat you!”

“Looking at the way he’s dressed, he’s probably not from our country! There’s no point saving someone like that!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Some of the guards voiced their objections successively.

However, the princess remained unmoved and ordered them to open Huang Xiaolong’s mouth. Pushing the pill through his lips, he swallowed it.

Once the Resurrection Pill was swallowed by Huang Xiaolong, the princess commanded, “Bring him along with us.”

When they heard that the princess was planning to bring the cripple of a man along with them, the soldiers could no longer restrain themselves. They stated their rapid persuasion in hopes that their princess would listen to reason and leave the man to die. However, they failed to change her mind and could only reluctantly bring the man along with them.

...

After quite some time, Huang Xiaolong finally woke up.
