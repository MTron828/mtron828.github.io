Colorful Balloons Take Flight

As thousands of Fifth Order God King Realm evil spirits fell down like withered leaves, an enormous whirlpool of divine lightning emerged high in the air above the mountain range. These dead evil spirits’ blood essence, life essence, and godforce all floated towards the spinning divine lightning whirlpool, and were absorbed into it. In a few seconds, corpses turned into gray dust and disappeared without a trace.

A light flashed as Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the rest appeared above the mountain range.

The whirlpool of divine lightning moved until it was right above Huang Xiaolong’s head. It sent the blood essences, life essences, and godforce it had sucked from the evil spirits’ corpses into Huang Xiaolong’s body. Huang Xiaolong felt rejuvenated and comfortable all over, as his vigorous godforce drummed like a heartbeat in his ears.

This ‘divine’ lightning was none other than the chaos golden dragon lightning. After Huang Xiaolong had broken through to God King Realm, he was able to control a great amount of chaos golden dragon lightning by taking it outside of his body, forming a whirlpool. All the evil spirits’ blood essences, life essences, and godforce were refined by the chaos golden dragon lightning whirlpool, expelling the impurities before being absorbed by Huang Xiaolong. The effect was actually better than consuming low-grade chaos spiritual pills!

Then again, only magical beasts and evil spirits’ blood essence, life essence, and godforce from Fifth Order God King Realm and above could have such an amazing effect. If it were blood essence, life essence, and godforce from low-level God King Realms, then, the effect would be lower than a low-grade chaos spiritual pills.

Hence, while searching for the grandmist aura in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, Huang Xiaolong mostly killed magical beasts and evil spirits that were Fifth Order God King Realm and above.

When the chaos golden dragon lightning whirlpool finished refining the blood essences, life essences, and godforce, it shrunk and returned to the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space in Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.

With the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s presence, Huang Xiaolong didn’t even need to use his Innumerable Buddha Godhead’s power to purify and refine these evil spirits and magical beasts’ essence energies, which saved him time and effort.

"Hehe, Little brat Huang, it looks like your luck is not so good this time ah.” The little cow’s teasing words sounded in the group’s ears.

During this year of roaming around the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, Huang Xiaolong had killed countless magical beasts and evil spirits, however, there was not even a shadow of the grandmist aura that Huang Xiaolong was looking for.

Huang Xiaolong was feeling surly, especially now due the little cow’s schadenfreude teasing.

A year had passed while he had roamed around, and now, there were only nine years left until the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition. Time was running out, and he could not afford to continue in this manner. His other option was to leave the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield to the Floating Twilight Land to look for the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele instead.

Though Huang Xiaolong’s strength had improved significantly during this time, he was not satisfied with the speed. This speed wouldn’t allow him to advance to Fourth Order God King Realm in nine years, at most, his cultivation would only reach peak late-Third Order God King Realm.

“Let’s look around for another month.” Huang Xiaolong decided after some thoughts.

If he still couldn’t find the grandmist aura in a month’s time, then they would head to Floating Twilight Land!

One month went by in the blink of an eye. Huang Xiaolong’s group stopped above a dead sea in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

Suddenly, a mid-Fifth Order God King Realm evil spirit flood-dragon drilled out from the dead sea with its jaws wide open to swallow Huang Xiaolong’s group.

With a light wave of Huang Xiaolong’s hand, the evil spirit flood-dragon exploded silently into a mist of blood.

“We’re heading to the Floating Twilight Land!” Huang Xiaolong said helplessly.

He still had not sensed any grandmist aura in this one month, thus, he could only move on and head to the Floating Twilight Land.

Having decided to leave the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, Huang Xiaolong did not dally anymore. Riding on the little cow, Huang Xiaolong sped through the layers of dense devil qi towards the border. Xiang Xun and the rest followed closely behind them.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had planned to head to the Immortal Phoenix Faith Palace to look at the Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix, see if he could awaken the Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix. He had also wanted to try subjugating the four odd beasts sealed under the Great Abyss of Ghosts, Gods, and Devils Formation. However, after listening to the little cow’s opinion, he scratched out both plans.

According to the little cow, based on his current strength, and even with Xiang Xun helping him, he still won’t be able to awaken that Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix nor subjugate the four beasts. It would be a trip in vain, and wasted time.

When Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation would step into the Heavenly Monarch Realm, and Xiang Xun’s strength recover to the peak, along with adding his Grandmist Parasitic Medium and chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool to that equation, he would be able to awaken that Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix and subjugate those four odd beasts.

Well, he would need to make another trip to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield after advancing to the Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Huang Xiaolong once again started looking forward to the Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix and four odd beasts’ strength.

Based on the little cow’s words, the Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix and four odd beasts were certainly four odd beasts, otherwise, why would she want him to wait until he advanced to Heavenly Monarch Realm?

Low-level Emperor Realm? Or mid-level? Perhaps high-level Emperor Realm?

Since those four odd beasts were infamous during the chaos era, and were said to have destroyed tens of thousands of world surfaces in the past, they probably weren’t as weak as low-level Emperor Realm...

“Xiaoniu, what was the strength of those four odd beasts in the chaos era? The top of mid-level Emperor Realm? Or high-level Emperor Realm?” Aboard the Dragon Shark Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong could not resist asking the little cow, as they flew over the Great Abyss of Ghosts, Gods, and Devils Formation.

However, the little cow’s attitude was nonchalant as she drawled, “Wouldn’t you come to know about that after subjugating the four odd beasts? What’s the use of knowing it now? Though their reputation is loud, it is still not worse compared to their previous Master.”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart tightened, “You mean that Archdevil master?”

The little cow nodded her head in affirmation, “That’s right, their Archdevil master’s name used to send terror in countless world surfaces, even the Devil World’s twelve Archdevils at the time kept their distance and stayed as far away as they could from him.”

Huang Xiaolong shuddered, that Archdevil master was so powerful!

At this moment, Huang Xiaolong realized that his many guesses about the Archdevil master in the past were still much too far from the truth.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s expression, the little cow snorted, “Scared? That Archdevil master is of the same era as the Lord of Hell, the Devil World’s Archdevil Lord and the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, more or less, he stands at the same height as me.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The same era as the Lord of Hell, Devil World’s Archdevil Lord, and the Ancient Heavenly Emperor!

But the last part of the sentence rendered Huang Xiaolong speechless. This old cow really can blow and talk big!

“What’s with that expression on your face? You don’t know, during my days of glory ....” The little cow couldn’t help start arguing.

“Alright, alright, you can talk about your history next time.” Huang Xiaolong promptly stopped her. “If that Archdevil master is of the same era as the Lord of Hell, the Devil World’s Archdevil Lord and Ancient Heavenly Emperor, then what happened to him? How come he disappeared? And why were his four subordinates chained and sealed in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield?”

The little cow harrumphed proudly, “I know the answer to your question, but why should I tell you?”

Clearly, this was her revenge against Huang Xiaolong because he had cut off her words earlier.

But under Huang Xiaolong’s ferocious and murderous glare, the little cow relented and explained, “That year, in order to cultivate a supreme evil technique, the Archdevil master had collected souls and blood essences, slaughtering countless cultivators and destroying more than ten thousand world surfaces. In the end, his actions had alarmed the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and other big shots. They gathered to vanquish him and his four odd beasts.”

“That battle was a tragedy.”

“Several hundred big world surfaces’ overlords took part in that battle, and more than half died. I can’t even count how many world surfaces were dyed red with their blood, and even Ancient Heavenly Emperor that kid suffered severe injuries.”
