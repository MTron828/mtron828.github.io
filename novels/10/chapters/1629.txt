“Your chief wishes to see me?” Huang Xiaolong asked curiously.

Jiao Qingshan nodded in affirmation and looked at Huang Xiaolong with envy, “That’s right.”

Not just anybody could meet the chief of the Netherworld King’s Organization! Even as a senior commander, it was extremely hard for him to even see chief Tai Yue.

Huang Xiaolong pondered for a moment and agreed, “Alright.”

Since they had already requested to see him, he felt that it would do him no harm to meet them.

Even though he didn’t know why the chief of the Netherworld King’s Organization wanted to see him, nothing bad should happen to him.

Hence, the two of them left the Brookspring Plane, and appeared in the vast and boundless space of the Hell Asura World.

The moment they entered the space above the Brookspring Plane, a brilliant light flashed before their eyes and a massive flying ship appeared before them.

This flying ship seemed to originate from the primordial era, and the ancient mysterious runes engraved on the hull of the ship emanated a pressure that made Huang Xiaolong’s heart tremble.

Looking at the flying ship in front of them, Jiao Qingshan fell to his knees respectfully, “This subordinate, Jiao Qingshan, pays his respect to the chief.”

“Alright, you can head back.” A majestic voice sounded from within the flying ship. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Yes, chief!” Jiao Qingshan didn’t dare to question his orders and he quickly flew away after bowing.

The moment Jiao Qingshan left, the door of the flying ship opened and four massive figures walked out.

As soon as the four massive figures appeared, the surrounding space started to buzz endlessly. It seemed as though the void was about to rupture under the air these four individuals were emitting before Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback when he saw the four of them. Four of the chiefs came to meet me!

Moreover, the aura that they emitted could only be described in one word... Strong!

When the four of them joined hands, Huang Xiaolong was afraid they would easily be a match for his senior brother, Jiang Hong!

It was absolutely possible that all four of them were at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong took a closer look at them and nearly yelled out in shock. The three horned Asura King, the twelve winged Demon King, Desolate Giant, and Ancient Golden Lionman?!

While Huang Xiaolong was still in a state of shock, the four of them arrived in front of him. At that moment, Huang Xiaolong felt as if he was nothing more than a grain of sand standing before four massive mountains that supported the heavens.

“Greetings, Master!” Suddenly, the four of them kneeled down respectfully before him. The excitement on their face was more than obvious.

“Mas... master?!” Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of terror wash over him.

Huang Xiaolong’s mind flashed as he recalled his guess earlier.

Don’t tell me the Netherworld King’s Organization really is... ?!

Tai Yue broke the silence and yelled happily, “Master, we have been waiting for you for more than ten billion years!”

“After more than ten billion years, you have finally arrived, Master!” Wan Yutian said heatedly.

More than ten billion years!

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded.

“Master, we watched your test and know that your darkness supreme godforce has the power of the Netherworld King’s Jade. You have to be the inheritor chosen by our old master!” Jin Yuan said as he choked with emotions.

“Master, your talent is unparalleled and only you can be our new Master!” Fan Hui waved his arms animatedly..

Huang Xiaolong felt his mind blank out and he didn’t know how to reply.

Even though he had quite a number of Emperor Realm experts under him, the majority of them were in the middle or early stages of the Emperor Realm.

However, the four chiefs of the Netherworld King’s Organization were peak late-Tenth Order Emperors! They were peak late-Tenth Order Emperors!

Huang Xiaolong then took a deep breath, and said as calmly as possible, “All four of you can get up.”

It seemed as though the Netherworld King’s Organization was left behind by the king of hell himself.

Once Huang Xiaolong understood this, he was unable to control the excitement bubbling up in his heart.

The Netherworld King’s Organization was the undisputed number one power in Hell.

The moment he gained control of the Netherworld King’s Organization, he would be able to control the massive superpower!

After the four of them paid their respect to Huang Xiaolong, they stood up.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the four of them and muttered in a low voice, “Seniors, even though I refined the fourth set of restrictions in the Netherworld King’s Jade, I have yet to receive the true inheritance of the king of hell. It isn’t appropriate for you to call me your Master yet.”

However, Jin Yuan shook his head and said, “Master, since you have the Netherworld King’s Jade and have even refined the fourth set of restrictions in it, it is only a matter of time before you receive the inheritance of our old Master. It’s only natural for us to call you our Master now.”

The three of them agreed one after another.

Looking at how insistent the four of them were, Huang Xiaolong could only drop the matter.

The four of them quickly completed their self introductions and they roughly explained the situation of the Netherworld King’s Organization.

“Master, are we heading to old master’s inheritance right now?” Wan Yutian asked.

“Let me return to Mongolia City first. We can move out tomorrow. ” Huang Xiaolong thought for a bit before giving his reply.

He had no idea how long the trip to the Mohe Plane would take and he decided to tie up the matters with the Keshen Mountain Range before leaving.

“Alright. We shall wait for master here!” Fan Hui replied respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and returned to Mongolia City on the Brookspring Plane.

Not long after returning to his residence in Mongolia City, Jiao Qingshan and Jia Yuan came over to look for him.

When Jiao Qingshan saw Huang Xiaolong, he smiled and asked, “Brother Duwei, no one will ever be able to break the record you set...”

Since Tai Yue was afraid of leaking Huang Xiaolong’s identity, he didn’t send a message to Jiao Qingshan. With Huang Xiaolong’s identity, Jiao Qingshan wouldn’t have dared to call him ‘Brother Duwei’ as soon as he learned of his true status.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Big Brother Jiao, you must be joking.”

“Brother Duwei, did our chief summon you to ask you about your test result?” Jiao Qingshan hesitated before asking.

Summon?

Huang Xiaolong laughed and didn’t deny it, “Yes.”

Jiao Qingshan decided to remain on the Brookspring Plane for another day to enjoy a conversation with Huang Xiaolong before personally giving him the rewards.

The rewards for the test weren’t much and there were only two items. There was a six star Netherworld King’s Divine Armor and a Netherworld King’s spatial ring that contained quite a number of spiritual stones and spiritual pills.

Before long, Jiao Qingshan and Jia Yuan bade him farewell.

After Huang Xiaolong settled everything regarding the Keshen Mountain Range, he left the Brookspring Plane and made his way to the Mohe Plane with Jin Yuan and the others.

Sitting on the Netherworld King’s flying ship, Huang Xiaolong felt the astonishing speed of the flying ship and asked Jin Yuan and the rest, “Is this a high-grade grandmist spiritual artifact?”

Even though the speed of his Black Dragon Throne was frightening, the Netherworld King’s Organization’s flying ship was even faster! It was many times faster than his Black Dragon Throne!

“Yes, Master, this was the flying ship our old Master left behind. It is indeed a high-grade grandmist spiritual artifact. Once you obtain old Master’s inheritance, you will be able to control it.” The few of them answered respectfully.

During the trip, Huang Xiaolong asked them lots of questions regarding the king of hell. As long as they had the answer, they would reply him.

More than a month later, the few of them finally arrived at the Mohe Plane.
