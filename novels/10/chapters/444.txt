Chapter 445: Refining Another Primordial Divine Dragon

Huang Xiaolong understood that his Senior Brother was persuading him for his own good, however, if the Ten Directions Continent had the Dragon God Grass that he needed, Huang Xiaolong was determined to make the trip.

He faced Shi Fantian saying, “This Dragon God Grass is very important to me, therefore this trip to the Ten Directions Continent is inevitable.”

Detecting the conviction in Huang Xiaolong’s voice, Shi Fantian didn’t try to persuade him further. Subsequently, Shi Fantian recounted his experience when he ventured into the Poison Dragon Valley so that Huang Xiaolong would have a minimum understanding of the place.

Huang Xiaolong quietly took note of everything his Senior Brother said.

At first, he had planned to stay in the Blessed Buddha Empire to refine two primordial divine dragons, but knowing that there was Dragon God Grass on the Ten Directions Continent, Huang Xiaolong changed his plan.

After staying for two more days in the Blessed Buddha Palace, Huang Xiaolong departed for the Ten Directions Continent.

When he left, Shi Xiaofei walked with him until ten thousand li outside the Blessed Buddha Imperial City.

As he turned to leave, Shi Xiaofei suddenly hugged him, vowing: “Big brother Huang, I will practice hard!” Then she turned around and left.

Huang Xiaolong caught a glimpse of the reluctance and sadness in her eyes.

It was quite some time later when Huang Xiaolong turned around and flew into the air, moving further away from the Blessed Buddha Imperial City.

Before going to the Ten Directions Continent, Huang Xiaolong decided to make a small detour toward the secret space at the bottom of the Broken Tiger Rift to see his family.

It had been a long time since he left the secret space and Huang Xiaolong wondered if his parents and siblings were doing well. Apart from that, he planned to refine two more primordial divine dragons in the Eminent Holiness secret space.

Flying the entire way, Huang Xiaolong reached the Eminent Holiness secret space five days later.

Huang Xiaolong’s return instantly brought a burst of cheer and liveliness in the Eminent Holiness space, sounds of laughter filled the air.

In little over a year since Huang Xiaolong left, everyone had improved greatly.

His younger brother Huang Xiaohai was already a Second Order Xiantian, Fei Hou had entered the Third Order Xiantian realm and was a peak early-Third Order Xiantian realm expert, whereas Marshal Houtian had reached the Fourth Order Xiantian realm.

After taking the hundred over Ghost King Dans bestowed by Huang Xiaolong, Yu Ming’s current strength had the reached the boundary limit of peak-half Saint. Although he had yet to break through to Saint realm, it was only a matter of time.

His parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, looked more and more youthful with the spirit pellets and elixirs given by Huang Xiaolong. Though both of their cultivations stagnated at peak late-Tenth Order Houtian, an average First Order Xiantian realm expert wasn’t their opponent.

His sister Huang Min and Guo Tai both advanced one order, whereas his nephew, Guo Xiaofan, had grown a lot taller. At seven years old, the little guy’s martial spirit was awakened and he began to cultivate battle qi.

What surprised Huang Xiaolong was that Guo Xiaofan’s martial spirit was a superb talent martial spirit, although being only a first-rank grade eleven martial spirit. With Huang Xiaolong’s guidance, Guo Xiaofan had a good chance of breaking into the Saint realm.

After spending ten carefree and relaxing days with the family, Huang Xiaolong once again went into closed-door practice to refine the primordial divine dragons.

This time, Huang Xiaolong planned to refine the primordial divine water dragon.

Like the fire dragon, the water dragon ranked at the bottom amongst the thirteen primordial divine dragons that Huang Xiaolong had, which made the refining process easier.

He sat cross-legged at the center of the Ten Buddha Formation after swallowing eight stalks Dragon God Grass. Breathing in, Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth and began sucking the faint blue water element true dragon essence as it slowly floated out from the primordial divine water dragon corpse, assimilating into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

At first contact, an overwhelming energy rushed into every corner of Huang Xiaolong’s body, extremely cold! This was Huang Xiaolong’s first sensation, subsequently, the coolness turned colder and colder, akin to pieces of thousand year old ice that couldn’t be melted.

As time passed, Huang Xiaolong’s skin, hair, eyebrows, his entire body turned blue.

Just when Huang Xiaolong felt like he could no longer endure the cold, a warm energy emerged from inside his body. This warm energy source came from the primordial divine fire dragon true essence he had refined.

The warm energy spread, reducing the coldness inside his body, bringing an indescribably comfortable feeling.

Blue-colored light and fiery-red glow continued to blend with each other. The whole Xumi Temple shone brightly with the blue and red lights enveloping Huang Xiaolong, his figure could no longer be seen.

Similar to the time when he refined the fire dragon, Huang Xiaolong had a long dream. In the dream, he turned into a primordial divine water dragon.

Time flowed by... Huang Xiaolong gradually woke up at one point.

Crystal blue light shone in his pupils as he opened his eyes, the space around was suddenly filled with droplets of water that turned into a small blue ocean.

Those droplets were the purest water element energy hidden in nature.

With a wave of his hand, the blue droplets gathered and turned into a blue water dragon, swimming in the blue ocean. When Huang Xiaolong’s hand stopped, the water dragon disintegrated and disappeared.

After refining the water dragon, Huang Xiaolong discovered that water and fire actually complemented each other, like the balance between yin and yang. His dragon essence body was once again enhanced, although still remaining extremely soft.

Huang Xiaolong ran his battle qi and actually tried stretching his body, extending more than a hundred meters! No matter which part or which direction, he was able to extend his body to a certain limit.

This was something he couldn’t do before!

It also definitely wasn’t something a Tenth Order Saint realm expert could do! Huang Xiaolong hadn’t imagined that there would be such a benefit after refining the primordial divine water dragon.

Other than that, his battle qi broke through to Sixth Order Saint realm, a great difference from a Fifth Order Saint realm. His true essence and spiritual force also improved greatly.

Huang Xiaolong sat down again at the center of the Ten Buddha Formation a short while later, planning to continue refining the second primordial divine dragon.

The next one Huang Xiaolong picked was the black dragon.

Among the thirteen primordial divine dragons, the black dragon was ranked middle in terms of strength. He chose the black dragon next because one of his martial spirits was the black dragon.

He believed that refining the primordial divine black dragon would bring great benefits to his black dragon martial spirit. To refine this black dragon, Huang Xiaolong swallowed all the remaining nine stalks of Dragon God Grass at one go.

The passage of time flowed by.

Multiple strands of black dragon true essence entered Huang Xiaolong’s body. What surprised Huang Xiaolong this time was the fact that there wasn’t any pain, instead, he was engulfed in an endless darkness.

One year and two months passed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

In the Eminent Holiness secret space, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others waited patiently for Huang Xiaolong to exit his closed-door practice. Before entering his seclusion, Huang Xiaolong told them that he would probably be in seclusion for fourteen months this time. Now, it was already fourteen months.

As Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the rest waited for Huang Xiaolong to come out, a sudden big tremor came from the Eminent Holiness’ space entrance.

Everyone’s face tightened.

“What is happening?!” Huang Peng questioned.

“Patriarch Huang, let me go have a look.” Yu Ming stated respectfully. In a quick flicker, he disappeared, but very soon, he returned, laden with bloody wounds.

“Yu Ming (Master)!” Huang Peng, Fei Hou, and everyone were shocked as they hastened to Yu Ming’s side.

“Patriarch Huang, it’s not good. This Eminent Holiness secret space has been discovered by others, these people are from Snow Dragon City!” Yu Ming heaved heavily, vomiting a mouthful of blood after barely uttering the last word.
