Chapter 2056: Implore Lord Wan Shi To Take Action

“Kill Huang Xiaolong!”

“Execute the Nine Yin Corpse Transformation Arts now and pull in Huang Xiaolong to die with us!”

Anguished screams came from some of the sorrowful Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors as they made a mad dash towards Huang Xiaolong. Their eyes were red with a vengeance and killing intent. Gray-colored blood burned throughout their bodies. It seemed to have condensed from corpse qi. When these Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors burned their blood, it triggered some kind of power within their bodies, one after another.

The little cow exhorted Huang Xiaolong, “Be careful. That is the Nine Yin Corpse Transformation Arts. It’s the most wicked technique of the tribe. It will be troublesome if you get stained with their corpse blood.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, indicating he understood.

He had somewhat bare knowledge about the Nine Yin Corpse Transformation Arts.

From the moment they had come into existence, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse’s tribesmen’s bodies were dead bodies, corpses. As they grew into adulthood, the innate corpse qi from their bodies accumulated and lurked inside them. Once this qi was triggered, the shocking explosive power was absolutely lethal.

However, only when forced to a dead-end would the Nine Yin Giant Corpse’s tribesmen resort to using the Nine Yin Corpse Transformation Arts. It was because once this method was used, they would turn into true corpses, unable to revert back. In other words, after executing the Nine Yin Corpse Transformation Arts, these Ancestors would lose their lives.

Facing a group of Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s desperados, Huang Xiaolong launched himself towards them instead of avoiding them with the Radiance Divine Scepter in his hand.

“DIE!”

The Radiance Divine Scepter pieced through the frontmost Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor’s head. Robust radiance godforce surged out from the scepter, shattering his soul and godhead in an instant.

The Radiance Divine Scepter was swiftly pulled out, and Huang Xiaolong was already throwing it at the next target.

Huang Xiaolong repeated the actions, piercing through the heads of several Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors, directly shattering their souls and godheads.

These Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe Ancestor’s corpse blood was extremely terrifying. Especially after executing the Nine Yin Corpse Transformation Arts, these Ancestors were immortal for a short time. Therefore, the only way to kill them was shattering their godhead and completely erasing their soul from this world.

Then again, probably only radiance divine artifacts such as Huang Xiaolong’s Radiance Divine Scepter could penetrate the layer of corpse blood above their skin. Had it been other divine artifacts, even a top-grade grandmist artifact, it wouldn’t have worked against the corpse blood. It would have been even less likely to have killed these Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors with it.

That was because of the corpse blood’s terrifying corrosive attribute. Any average top-grade grandmist artifact would be corroded the moment it came in contact with the corpse blood, greatly weakening the artifact’s power.

Every time the Radiance Divine Scepter was thrust out, it resulted in the death of one Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor.

Moments later, Huang Xiaolong had killed all the desperado Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors.

Whereas other Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors had either fled or knelt down in submission.

One hour later...

Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and Du Hai killed all of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s members who had chosen to flee. Only the Ancestors and disciples, who had chosen to submit, remained.

Without Shi Ming around, Huang Xiaolong’s group was literally unstoppable, leaving a great shadow looking over the Nine Yin Giant Corpse’s tribesmen’s hearts.

The other restrictive formations on the Nine Yin Mountain Range were destroyed by the little cow, King of Darkness, and Du Hai consecutively.

Although the majority of these restrictive formations were arranged by Shi Ming personally, they failed to impede Huang Xiaolong’s group’s advance.

“Boneless Mind Confounding Flower!”

“Yang Core Nether Divine Fruit!”

......

“Good stuff ah, Shi Ming, that old guy actually has so much good stuff!”

Scanning the treasures placed within the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s forbidden land, even someone with the little cow, King of Darkness, and Du Hai’s standards tsked in amazement with sparkling eyes.

Both the Boneless Mind Confounding Flower and Yang Core Nether Divine Fruit were level one origin treasures. More than a dozen kinds of level one origin trees were planted on the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s forbidden land.

“Pity, they have not ripened yet!”

The only regret was that these level one origin treasures had yet to mature. The earliest to ripen would take at least one million years to ripen, or they would really have reaped a big harvest this time.

“Is there a way to enable these level one origin treasures to mature faster?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The King of Darkness shook his head, “It is impossible to speed up the ripening process of a level one origin treasure.”

“Actually, it’s not like there is no way.” The little cow suddenly said. “If you can gather all nine chaos lightning pools, integrate them, and let them evolve into a grandmist lightning pool, it could spur the growth of these origin-level treasures. For example, that Boneless Mind Confounding Flower needs another one million years to bloom. If we place it inside the grandmist lightning pool and nourish it day in and day out with grandmist lightning vitality, it might bloom in ten thousand years.”

The Six-Winged Green Mosquito Race’s Old Ancestor Du Hai also shook his head, “To gather all nine chaos lightning pools is easier said than done. I have never heard of anyone succeed in that feat. Forget all nine chaos lightning pools, no one has even gathered three chaos lightning pools.”

The little cow chuckled mischievously as she pointed at Huang Xiaolong, “There are currently six chaos lightning pools in Xiaolong’s body.”

“WHAT?!!!” The Six-Winged Green Mosquito Race’s Old Ancestor Du Hao and King of Darkness exclaimed in unison. They looked incredulous as their eyes stared unblinkingly at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was embarrassed being stared at by the two men for so long, and he coughed, “It’s just some luck.”

Du Hai looked like he was looking at a maverick monster as he questioned, “This is called just some luck?!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and changed the subject as he said, “Let’s go. We need to move things. This Nine Yin Treasury should have a lot of good stuff!” Finishing that, he flew forward to the Nine Yin Treasury.

Before long, the four of them were standing in the air above the Nine Yin Treasury’s entrance. The little cow and the other two Sovereigns opened the entrance, and the whole group stepped inside.

Although Huang Xiaolong had managed to enter the Nine Yin Treasury the last time by controlling the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Young Lord Shi Yinyu to steal some Star Sand and grandmist aura, he had not gotten a good look at the entire treasury. Thus, similar to the little cow and the rest, this could be considered his first time inside there.

Looking at the richness accumulated within the Nine Yin Treasury, even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t stop whistling in admiration. So did the little cow, King of Darkness, and Du Hai. Their eyes had not stopped shining ever since stepping inside the treasury.

While Huang Xiaolong’s group was admiring the wealth of treasures inside the treasury, in the Demon World billions and billions of miles away, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming suddenly exuded a frenzy killing intent, roaring towards the sky, “Huang Xiaolong, I’m going to kill you even if that’s the last thing I do!”

Old Monster Lun Zhuan, King of Shadows, and others exchanged a suspicious glance.

“Brother Shi Ming, is something the matter?” The King of Shadows asked, feeling puzzled.

Shi Ming briefly told the others that Huang Xiaolong had wiped out the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe headquarters.

“What? So fast! This... how did Huang Xiaolong reach Hell Spirits World from the Radiance World in such a short time!?”

Old Monster Lun Zhuan, King of Shadows, Old Crow Ancestor, and the rest were visibly shocked.

Shi Zhen spoke in a solemn voice, “There must be a secret we are unaware of behind why Huang Xiaolong could arrive in the Spirits World from the Radiance World in such a short time.”

Old Crow Ancestor’s pupils glimmered with an obscure light. Since Huang Xiaolong had already wiped out the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters, then the next place Huang Xiaolong destroyed might very well be his Demon Mountain.

Old Monster Lun Zhuan looked at everyone present as he spoke, “Now, in the universe, only Lord Wan Shi can suppress Huang Xiaolong. Therefore, we must stay together right now, and head over to the City of All-Heavens, and implore Lord Wan Shi to take action. As long as Lord Wan Shi is willing to come out, Huang Xiaolong’s dead for sure!”

“Agreed!” Shi Ming and the King of Shadows were the first people to agree.

Old Crow Ancestor hesitated briefly before bidding his head in agreement. Lastly, it was Shi Zhen.

The group hastened to the City of All-Heavens.
