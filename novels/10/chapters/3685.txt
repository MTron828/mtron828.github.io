Chapter 3686 – Subduing the Five Kings

Zhu Chen snorted coldly, “Dream on!”

Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed once again and Zhu Chen became the target of the Three Gods Halberd. The Three Gods Halberd was no Reversal Sword! When it slammed into the Golden Sun Circlet, Zhu Chen lost feeling in his arms. The universe treasure was sent flying into the air as Zhu Chen spat out mouthfuls of blood.

A terrifying wave of energy appeared behind Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden. The five monster kings were back, and they weren’t planning on giving Huang Xiaolong a good time. They attacked him in unison and Huang Xiaolong no longer held back. The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd turned to sweep towards the five monster kings and Huang Xiaolong summoned the four Universe Origin Fires to protect himself.

As soon as the origin fires appeared, the four fires’ spirits charged out as flames covered god knew how many miles around him. The entire space was turned into a sea of flames.

The five monster kings were able to defend themselves, but the tiny monsters weren’t so lucky. They were charred beyond belief by the sea of flames.

The four Universe Origin Fires were the source of all fire in the universe. It was the best counter to anything related to the Netherworld.

As such, Huang Xiaolong managed to burn off all the poison around him.

Even though the five monster kings were existences who lived since the creation of the Netherworld, they had to retreat in the face of the four Universe Origin Fires.

If they were only facing one of the fires, the five monster kings might not be afraid at all. However, all four of them appeared at once and even if the five monster kings were two times as strong as they were, they wouldn’t be able to suppress the combination of the fires.

“Universe Origin Fires!” Zhu Chen yelled.

First there was the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

Then, the kid summoned the Reversal Sword and the Three Gods Halberd!

Now, he revealed the existence of the four Universe Origin Fires!

How in the world did someone gather four universe treasures?!

What kind of dog-sh*t luck did one have to have in order to obtain so many universe treasures?!

The five monster kings stared at each other in an attempt to communicate among themselves.

Soon after, they turned around to flee without any hesitation.

Since the Netherworld came into existence along with the universe, the five monster kings were more than experienced. They could see that Huang Xiaolong was no Zhu Chen! They had no chance of winning against him! As such, they decided to back off.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t allow any of them to get away. He made his preparations the moment he summoned the flames.

Starlight fell from the void and it transformed the space around them. An endless amount of star dragon qi filled the area.

The Star Dragon Divine Tree branches extended out at a speed faster than anything the monster kings could imagine and they quickly caught up.

The four origin fires also managed to catch up with the fleeing monster kings before long.

With the combination of the Universe Origin Fires and the Star Dragon Divine Tree, they were forced back towards Huang Xiaolong.

The branches of the Star Dragon Divine Tree started to extend in all directions, cutting off the space from the outside world.

Zhu Chen jumped in fright as he discovered that the seal trapped him in place too!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with Zhu Chen at the moment and he made his way over to the five monster kings.

Zhu Chen was barely able to threaten him.

As such, he decided to deal with the five monster kings before anything else.

With the Star Dragon Divine Tree separating them from the outside world, Zhu Chen couldn’t escape even if he wanted to!

Soon, the battle between one man and five monster kings began.

Heaven shattering blasts rang through the space.

In the star dragon world that was created, not a single creature was left other than the five monster kings and the two humans.

As the battle raged on, even Zhu Chen didn’t dare to approach. He hid in one of the furthest corners of the star dragon world.

Despair filled his heart when he saw how Huang Xiaolong was suppressing all five monster kings.

The fear in his eyes grew stronger and stronger as time passed.

He tried his hardest to shatter the barrier created by the Star Dragon Divine Tree, but with his strength, he wasn’t even close to causing a scratch in the barrier!

Even with his Golden Sun Circlet, he couldn’t do a thing!

The Golden Sun Circlet might possess strong defensive abilities, but there was no way they were as strong as the Reversal Sword and the Three Gods Halberd!

The battle had the ability to shatter the heavens and split the earth. The space within the star dragon world was a mess and as the battle raged on, Zhu Chen could only use his Golden Sun Circlets to prevent himself from getting injured by the shockwaves.

No matter how strong it was, it failed to stop the impact completely.

Every time a blast rang through the skies, his heart would jump as he got ready to receive the incoming strike.

The battle raged on for one entire day.

After the day had passed, Huang Xiaolong finally subdued all five monster kings.

As they prostrated before him, they became five cute creatures that no longer possessed any threat to Huang Xiaolong.

When he saw the look in their eyes, he felt a weird feeling running through his body.

It was truly a weird feeling for five ferocious beasts to look at him that way.

After subduing them, Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards Zhu Chen.

When he arrived, Zhu Chen had sealed himself in the defensive barrier created by his universe treasure.

“What… What do you want from me?!”

Even when he faced the Green Ghost, he wasn’t as afraid as he was now!

“You know what I want.” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “You saw what happened to the five of them. I’ll give you three minutes to consider your fate.”

Zhu Chen’s expression flickered uncontrollably.

Eventually, he fell to his knees as he submitted to Huang Xiaolong. He handed over his Golden Sun Circlet.

With Huang Xiaolong’s strength, there was no way he could escape! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the treasure and sighed.
