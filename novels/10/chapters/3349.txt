Chapter 3350: Devil Creatures on Earth

 

Several minutes later, Huang Xiaolong returned to earth. An hour later, he arrived in the Blue Dragon Orchard. Wang Meilan and the others cried out in fright, “Xiaolong, you’re finally back!” 

“What’s going on?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“Something big happened!” Wang Meilan held Huang Xiaolong’s arm and cried, “Something happened on the African Continent!” 

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised. Matters in the African Continent didn’t seem to affect them.

“Two days ago, cracks started forming all over the continent. A massive valley appeared and countless monsters poured out from it.” Wang Meilan explained, “Now, those monsters are all over the world. All the alliances would suffer hundreds of thousands of casualties a day!” 

“That’s right. The problem isn’t so serious in our Huaxia Alliance, but the situation in Africa and Egypt is the worst! Millions of people are devoured by the monsters each day.” Huang Jiyuan continued, “Everyone is hiding in fear right now. No one dares to leave their house at night!” 

“Every night, the monsters will become extremely active.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

A bottomless valley in Africa?

“Did the Divine Court Sect and the others send out their men?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“They sent out practically everyone in their sect to kill the monsters. The alliances formed an army of one hundred million to combat them, but it’s useless! More than ten thousand monsters are appearing every second, and we’re overwhelmed!” Huang Jiyuan shook his head and sighed.

“Even the weakest of the monsters are in the Xiantian Realm. There are many more in the Foundation Building and Golden Core Realm. It’s said that the strongest among them has reached the Enlightenment Realm!” 

“Luckily for us, there are no Spirit Severing Realm monsters.”

Huang Xiaolong was slightly surprised. 

If there were so many pouring out from the valley, there would be more than thirty million in an hour! 

That would mean that there are hundreds of millions of them appearing in a day!

It has already been two days, and there should be almost a billion of them! 

It was no wonder the great sects and alliances were unable to do anything.

“Did anyone go to investigate the valley?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Huang Shengan said that Yuan Hui of the Purple Flame Sect went over personally. However, he failed to discover a thing.” Wang Meilan sighed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. 

Yuan Hui was at the peak of the late Ninth Level Enlightenment Realm. He was one of the six strongest experts on Earth, and if he failed to find anything, the problem should be more serious than they thought.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong contacted Yuan Hui and Huang Shengan. He asked for a report on everything that had happened in the past few days.

A frown formed on his face after he got their report. The situation was worse than he thought. Countless cities in Africa had already been reduced to rubble, and the monsters were still pouring out endlessly. The territory of the humans had been greatly reduced and if nothing was done about it, Africa and the various countries around it would be lost!”

Now, refugees were fleeing as far away as they could.

“Didn’t the sects and alliances send their members to fight the monsters, is a hundred million troops unable to secure the continent?” 

Yuan Hui shook his head. “The monsters are mostly gathered in Africa. Forty percent of them went to the various alliances, and all of us are only able to slay those that ventured out of the continent. The alliances are protecting their major cities, and no one has the ability to send troops over to the African Continent to fight the source of the problem.”

Huang Shengan continued, “Our Huaxia Alliance sent 20 million troops but we were unable to protect the territory of the alliance. I’m afraid that there are more than 20 million monsters roaming about the Huaxia Alliance, and they are attacking the cities closest to the waters.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

Huang Xiaolong spoke to the heads of the various alliances and great families before passing down an order. He ordered everyone, including the old ancestors, to head out to kill the monsters.

No one dared to hold back after receiving the order from Huang Xiaolong.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong contacted Zhang Yuhan to ask about matters regarding the family.

As the Zhang Family wasn’t too far away from the Blue Dragon Orchard, Huang Xiaolong had long since laid down a grand formation to protect them. No harm would befall them.

“Why don’t you come over to the Blue Dragon Orchard?” Huang Xiaolong asked Zhang Yuhan.

Her heart fluttered slightly, but she shook her head eventually. “I can’t abandon all the disciples of my Zhang Family. After all, all of them have devoted their lives to the family.”

“Dummy… No harm will befall them when they stay in your Zhang Family Manor.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “There’s no need for you to worry. I’ll head over in a little bit and seal up the valley.”

“What?! You’re going to Africa?!” Zhang Yuhan’s expression changed. “Xiaolong, you can’t go! It’s too dangerous! Even Lord Yuan Hui was unable to go deep into the valley. It’s too dangerous there! Lord Yuan Hui’s true essence protection crumbled after he went nearly a thousand meters deep… Moreover, there are terrifying restrictions all around the valley! Even a nuke can’t do anything to the monsters there.” 

“Even if you go, you won’t be able to do anything!” 

Zhang Yuhan panicked.

She knew that Huang Xiaolong was strong, but all she knew was that he could defeat Yuan Hui in a battle. She had no idea the true extent of his strength!

“Relax… Nothing will happen to me.” Huang Xaiolong chuckled. “If anything happens, I’ll leave as soon as I sense the slightest bit of danger.” 

As his body was stronger than ordinary God of Creation Realm experts, there was no need to be afraid of the devil qi in the valley. Even though he restricted his strength, he couldn’t force his body to regress back to a weaker state. Even if the devil qi was a billion times stronger, it wouldn’t harm Huang Xiaolong in the slightest. 

“You have to be careful… I… I’ll wait for you to return!” Zhang Yuhan sighed as she stared at Huang Xiaolong with a deep gaze.

“Alright!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.

After chatting for a little while longer, they disconnected the call.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong left the courtyard for the African Continent.

Huang Xiaolong took less than an hour to cross the ocean. 

When one of the cities in the African Continent appeared in his sights, he was distracted by a yell.

“Are you crazy?! The city has already been invaded by the monsters! Why are you still heading there?!” 

The person who screamed at him was a female, and she was in a party of six. The group was mixed, and there were several old people among them. The girl who yelled at him had dark skin, and she was clad in purple robes. From her accessories, Huang Xiaolong could tell that she was a disciple of one of the great families on the African Continent. The others should be the guards sent to protect her.
