Chapter 3004: Huang Xiaolong, Who Would Have Thought!

Huang Xiaolong slammed into a mountain range located at the edge of the Dragon Cloud Sea.

Explosions rang through the skies, and the experts in the crowd yelled in excitement.

“Nice!” It was especially so for those from the Radiant Winged Dragon Race, Heavenly Phoenix Race, and the Coiled Dragon Race. They clapped with glee when they saw the exchange.

“Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would be on the receiving end!” Feng Nana gnashed her teeth together, and she roared with laughter.

“Huang Xiaolong was too careless! If he had summoned his Huang Long Armor, he wouldn’t have to suffer from the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor’s attack!” The White Dragon Patriarch sighed. “He was too confident in his defense! Confidence is great, but too much of it makes him arrogant!”

“Even if he had used the Huang Long Armor, he might not have been able to block Lord World Master’s Lightning’s Fury!” The Blue Dragon Patriarch sneered, “The Huang Long Armor might be the strongest armor in existence, but one needs the appropriate strength to utilize the armor! Huang Xiaolong is a mere Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, and he won’t be able to bring out the armor’s true power!”

The Coiled Dragon Patriarch clapped his hands in joy as he laughed at Huang Xiaolong’s misfortune, “I said it before, and I’ll say it again! Lord World Master has already reached perfection level in both the power of lightning and darkness! Huang Xiaolong is bound to lose! Not to mention the fact that Lord World Master only used the power of lightning previously… If he used the power of darkness, Huang Xiaolong would be in an even worse state!”

Among the thirteen elements, darkness was ranked even higher than the power of lightning!

After Ao Heng sent Huang Xiaolong flying, he didn’t press on to end the battle. Instead, he hovered in the skies silently while looking at the fallen Huang Xiaolong.

Several breaths later, a figure shot into the skies from the rubble.

With his body looking like a withered branch that was struck by lightning, his skin was charred black. The power of lightning swirled around his body, and it continued to wreak havoc in his body.

Those watching the battle sucked in a cold breath, and they couldn't believe how strong Huang Xiaolong’s grand dao physique actually was. Of course, no matter how strong it was, he wouldn’t be able to hold out for long if he was in such a sorry state after the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor’s opening attack.

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath, and he activated the power of his Huang Long Bloodline. As the power of nirvana enveloped him, the power of lightning that was destroying his insides was flushed out in an instant. The charred skin started to peel off his body, and he seemed to return back to his peak state.

Ao Heng stared at Huang Xiaolong as his expression changed. “Major completion in the power of nirvana!”

The power of nirvana was ranked third among the thirteen elements, and it ranked behind the power of space! It was something much stronger than his power of absolute lightning!

It was too bad… Huang Xiaolong hadn’t reached perfection level in the power of nirvana.

When Feng Ming and the others noticed what happened, they were taken aback.

“Who would have thought that Huang Xiaolong would reach major completion in the power of nirvana…” Ao Ji swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock as his expression turned complicated.

“Even so, it’s useless against the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor,” Feng Nana snorted. “He’s still going to lose!”

Ao Heng started walking towards Huang Xiaolong slowly when he saw that Huang Xiaolong was fine. “Your Highness, your power of nirvana might have reached major completion stage, but you’re not a match for me. You should admit defeat now. If you force me to continue, I won’t hold back.”

“I only used fifty percent of my power when I unleashed the Lightning’s Fury previously.”

Ao Heng’s words shocked those watching the battle.

“What?! How could that only be half of his strength?!”

“If he goes all out, wouldn’t Huang Xiaolong be crippled?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t respond, and he stared at the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor silently. He didn’t want to use the Huang Long Armor as it was a creation-level artifact. He felt that using the Huang Long Armor gave him an unfair advantage, but it seemed as though he wouldn’t be able to win if he didn’t use it.

With a single thought, the Huang Long Armor appeared around his body. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The Huang Long Armor had remained in its first form previously, and it was a mere tattoo surrounding his body. Now, the armor materialized and formed around his body, reaching its second form.

With three forms in total, the dragon tattoo possessed the weakest defensive abilities. The armor was strengthened in its second form, and it would be the strongest when Huang Xiaolong used the third form! If he decided to unleash the third form of the armor, he would be able to hide in the armor, like a baby in an egg! As long as the Huang Long Armor remained intact, Huang Xiaolong would never be injured!

Of course, there was a drawback to the third form of the armor. It might possess the strongest defense, but he wouldn’t be able to attack effectively!

With the armor clad around his body, Huang Xiaolong looked like a dragon with golden scales. The scales shone in the light, and they looked like the most magnificent items in all the lands.

“Huang Long Armor!”

A burning gaze could be seen in the eyes of those all around when he revealed the armor. Even Feng Ming and the others couldn’t contain their desire for the item.

That was a creation-level artifact they were talking about!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with what they thought, and he moved the moment the armor appeared. He turned into a streak of golden light that shot towards the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor.

Not even experts at the level of Ao Ji and Feng Ming could make out Huang Xiaolong’s figure.

How could he be so fast?!

“Wasn’t the Huang Long Armor known for its defense?! How can it improve his speed?!” Ao Ji yelped in shock.

No one understood what was going on.

Of the four items in the Set of Creation, the Huang Long Armor was known for its defense. The Huang Long Cape was made for speed, and the Huang Long Twin Blades were made to be the strongest weapons in all the lands! The Huang Long Heart allowed one to revive infinitely, and that was something everyone thought when they learned about the Set of Creation, but all of them were wrong.

The Huang Long Armor might have been built for defense, but it could also boost the power contained in his attacks and his speed when he moved! The only difference was that the increase wasn’t as exaggerated as the other items in the Huang Long Creation Set!

Boom!

The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor was clearly taken aback by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden increase in strength, and he was beaten back several miles.

Everyone gasped in shock.

“Nice!” Yelling in joy, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor started his counterattack. He turned into a streak of light as he clashed with the golden ray of light that Huang Xiaolong had become.

Every time they slammed into each other, the Dragon Cloud Sea would tremble under the impact.

In several breaths of time, no one knew how many times they had clashed with each other.

In the eyes of others, the two of them were merely smashing into each other with brute force. However, the exchange wasn’t as simple as it seemed, as Huang Xiaolong came to blows with the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor every time they came into contact with each other. That was the true battle, and they were comparing their grand dao arts whenever they exchanged attacks.
