That insidious devil qi was dense and suffocating, even some high-level God Realm devil cultivators would have a hard time enduring it. However, for these devil cultivators who were peak late-Tenth Order God Realm and above, the demonic devil qi was still bearable.

Moreover, to those old devils with high cultivation, this insidious devil qi was in fact a treasure. If they could stay and cultivate inside this Devil Cave for a hundred years, it would definitely be comparable to their improvement in a thousand years outside.

As Huang Xiaolong flew deeper into the cave, he continuously circulated the Asura Tactics, drawing the surrounding devil qi into his body, refining and absorbing it. Huang Xiaolong was inwardly delighted after absorbing that insidious devil qi for some time, for he discovered that this devil qi also contained the Hundred Spirit Beast King’s demonic qi!

Even though the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s demonic qi contained within the devil qi was extremely weak and others might not detect it, Huang Xiaolong had refined the other parts of the its body parts, hence he was familiar with its demonic qi.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had only deduced that the Devil Cave could be one of the places where the last part of the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s body was sealed, but he was sure of it now.

Right at this moment, Pan Hai who had been flying at the front suddenly stopped and turned his piercing gaze toward Huang Xiaolong.

“Bai Zhisheng, come here,” said Pan Hai.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart tightened, did this Ghost Demon see through him?

However, Huang Xiaolong had no option but to step forward, saluting respectfully, “Lord Ghost Demon.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I heard that some time ago you got your hands on a Ghost Emperor Scripture?” Ghost Demon Pan Hai asked.

Ghost Emperor Scripture? Huang Xiaolong secretly breathed in relief hearing this.

This Ghost Emperor Scripture was one of ancient devil sects’ Ten Great Devil Tenets. Some time back, Bai Zhisheng found the Ghost Emperor Scripture by luck and had been cultivating it in secret ever since. No one knew about it, who would have thought that this Ghost Demon found out.

“This subordinate indeed found the Ghost Emperor Scripture some time back, only waiting for the day of the Devil Cave’s opening to offer it to Lord Ghost Demon.” A brief pause later, Huang Xiaolong took out a square black metal token that emitted a soft golden glow.

The said Ghost Emperor Scripture was embedded within this black metal token.

The day he killed Bai Zhisheng, he found this Ghost Emperor Scripture inside his spatial ring.

Huang Xiaolong was glad that he threw the Ghost Emperor Scripture into his Asura Ring, otherwise, he would be suspected right now.

Ghost Demon Pan Hai’s hand sucked the black square metal into his hand and used his divine sense to check it, smiling at Huang Xiaolong, “Not bad, it really is the Ghost Emperor Scripture. When you return later, come to Ghost Demon Valley, you can cultivate in the Ghost Demon Pool for two months.”

The Ghost Demon Pool was created by Ghost Demon Pan Hai by collecting countless various medicinal herbs from the Devil Domain Mainland and other treasures to refine a spiritual pool. Needless to say, the benefits of cultivating in the pool were enormous.

Other devil sect heads revealed envious looks at Huang Xiaolong hearing this.

Huang Xiaolong quickly made a show of gratitude.

“Alright now, everyone separate and search for the treasures. When we leave, I’ll tabulate your merits according to the number of Demonic Devil Beads you’ve gathered.” Ghost Demon Pan Hao said to everyone.

Inside this Devil Cave, other than Demonic Devil Beads that were condensed every thousand years, there were quite a few other treasures. This was also one of the reasons why Ghost Demon, Crimson Devil, and the other two would lead a group of people every time they entered.

Each time they opened the Devil Cave’s sealing formation, it would only remain open for ten days’ time.

Ghost Demon, Crimson Devil, Flaming Devil, and Gorb Fiend mainly focused on snatching Demonic Devil Beads and had no time to search for other treasures within the cave, leaving this task to people like Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

Naturally, these treasures needed to be handed out once they were outside the Devil Cave.

At Ghost Demon’s order to disperse and search for treasures, all the devil sects heads acknowledged respectfully, elation in their hearts as they went off in different directions.

“This Bai Zhisheng’s quite ambitious, cultivating in secret after obtaining the Ghost Emperor Scripture. Today, if it weren’t because Valley Master asked him about this, he wouldn’t have offered up the Ghost Emperor Scripture.” One of Ghost Demon’s Grand Enforcer stared coldly at Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure.

Ghost Demon Pan Hai nodded in agreement, “The most important task right now is to search for the Demonic Devil Bead. Wait till he comes to the Ghost Demon Pool to cultivate, I will personally deal with him. My Ghost Demon Banner is just missing a few devil cultivators’ corpses.”

“Go, first find the Demonic Devil Bead.”

“Yes, Valley Master.”

Ghost Demon Pan Hai and his Grand Enforcers disappeared from the spot in a flicker.

After Pan Hai’s group left, the spot where they stood earlier rippled as Huang Xiaolong’s figure emerged.

Huang Xiaolong looked coldly in the direction where Pan Hai’s group left, sneering, ‘These old devils, each and every one of them is ruthless.’

“Ghost Demon Banner,” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

Huang Xiaolong pushed the thoughts of Pan Hai out of his mind and flew towards the deeper parts of the cave, following the trails of the devil qi.

Other than treasures, the cave was plentiful with demonic creatures as well. Especially in the deeper parts of it, some of the more powerful demonic creatures were comparable to First Order Highgod Realm masters, and a few were even as strong as Second Order Highgod Realm masters.

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong dared not be careless despite having confidence in his own strength.

Just as he was flying toward the deeper part of the Devil Cave, a sharp sword qi suddenly pierced through the air, blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path. Two people appeared in front of him, one of them being the Skeleton Sect’s Mo Leng. Other than Mo Leng, there was also an old man with bulging arms.

From Bai Zhisheng’s memories, this old man was the Venomous Scorpion Sect’s Chief, a perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm master.

“Bai Zhisheng! Today, the Devil Cave will be your burial place!” Mo Leng gnashed his teeth, a sword forged from an earth dragon’s bone appeared in his hand, pointed at Huang Xiaolong. The bone sword was exuding a harsh green light.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the two people blocking his way with cold indifference, “You can still make it if you flee now.”

Mo Leng and the old man were stunned, then broke out in mocking laughter.

“Bai Zhisheng, what did you just say? My ears didn’t hear wrong, right?” The Venomous Scorpion Sect Chief ridiculed, “You think you’re a Highgod Realm master?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, he couldn’t be bothered to waste any more time. With a wave of his hand, the Venomous Scorpion Sect Chief was pulled right up to him. Huang Xiaolong’s fingers clenched and the old man exploded.

Mo Leng was stunned watching this. As fear crept into his eyes, he turned around and tried to flee.

Looking at Mo Leng, a wisp of true immortal essence force shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s finger, piercing through his back in an instant. Starting from Mo Leng’s chest, the true immortal essence fire began to spread outward, reaching his four limbs in less than a breath’s time, burning him to ashes.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stay there for long, continuing to fly deeper into the cave.

The Devil Cave was only open for ten days, and Huan Xiaolong needed to find the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s legs, subdue them, and take them away in this short period. Otherwise, once ten days passed and Pan Hai and the others left the Devil Cave, he wouldn’t be able to leave for a thousand years.

There were seventy years left until the Highgod Advancement Tournament, being trapped here was not on Huang Xiaolong’s list.

One day later, after killing several hundred demonic creatures, Huang Xiaolong finally arrived at the deepest part of Devil Cave. Here, the devil qi was at its densest, forming dark green yin clouds. Those dark green clouds exuded an invisible power that greatly suppressed one’s soul, even Highgod Realm masters would not have an easy time inside.

As Huang Xiaolong went deeper into the green clouds, his face was looking ever grimmer. Stopping on top of a rock stalagmite, he performed the Blood Sacrifice Law with a drop of his blood essence, dropping it onto the ground. Almost immediately, a strange energy fluctuation came from below.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone with joy, drilling down into the earth until he reached the source of the strange fluctuations.

Soon, he reached the familiar gray space that sealed the Hundred Spirits Beast King.

Just as Huang Xiaolong entered the gray space, Flaming Devil Ruan Ji, Ghost Demon Pan Hai, Crimson Devil Shi Jiutian, and Gorb Fiend Wang Han arrived at the deepest region of the cave, for the Demonic Devil Bead always appeared somewhere within the Devil Cave’s deepest parts.
