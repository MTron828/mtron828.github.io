Six days later...

Huang Xiaolong, who had been flying across the sea, finally stopped. Ahead of him was a megacity floating above the sea surface. The majestic city walls were made from materials unknown to Huang Xiaolong, reflecting rings of opulent white halos. This white halo illuminated the surrounding several million li radius sea area.

This was the Nightless City.

The entire Night Sea resembled a giant black hole, and the Nightless City was the bright shining pearl on the Night Sea, giving a ray of hope to those in despair around the Night Sea.

Huang Xiaolong nudged the Thunder Bone Roger to accelerate. Moments later, they reached the Nightless City’s gates.

The guards at the Nightless City’s gates were core disciples of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. These disciples escorted Huang Xiaolong, no, ‘Grand Elder Luo Haoming’ into Nightless City upon his arrival.

Other forces’ disciples were required to pay a large number of spirit stones to enter Nightless City, but Huang Xiaolong was naturally exempted from this.

The brightness inside Nightless City resembled day time in the Divine World. Almost in every corner of the city was luminance night pearl and radiant stone walls. Grand architectures decorated the streets. However, Huang Xiaolong was not in the mood to appreciate the Nightless City’s scenery. He headed straight to the Nefarious Dragon Inn.

Fang Mingyu was currently residing at the Nefarious Dragon Inn.

As Huang Xiaolong headed to the Nefarious Dragon Inn, Fang Mingyu was frowning deeply. His eyes were filled with uneasiness and anxiety.

Fang Mingyu had disguised as a devil to sneak into the Nine Yin Plane, and his current identity was a Grand Elder of Piercing Moon Cult called Yang Jun.

He had already killed the real Yang Jun.

The Piercing Moon Cult ranked sixth amongst the Spirit World’s super forces. Initially, Fang Mingyu had thought that Yang Jun’s identity as the Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder would be more convenient for him to take actions. However, today, he had learned through some channels that the Piercing Moon Cult’s higher echelons had begun to suspect him. Probably, they had already sent someone over to capture him.

Although the Piercing Moon Cult wasn’t aware that he was the Divine World’s Fortune Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple, his identity would be exposed once they captured him. At that time, he would surely die.

“What to do?!” Fang Mingyu inwardly asked himself again and again.

Right about now, the Nightless City was probably on high alert to prevent him from escaping. The Piercing Moon Cult’s experts were probably waiting to ambush him at the city gates, and even if he wanted to make a run for it now, he would fail to leave Nightless City.

At every corner of the Nightless City were Piercing Moon Cult’s experts, and it won’t take long for them to find him in this inn.

Fang Mingyu had been hiding in Nightless City for some time now. Initially, he had wanted to wait for an auction that was scheduled half a month later, to buy a better divine armor so he could withstand the frigid qi in the depths of the Night Sea. At the same time, he planned to find a group that would venture deeper into the Night Sea. This would make it safer to deal with the sea beasts in the Night Sea.

Had he known that he would fall into this predicament, he wouldn’t have entered Nightless City a few days back, entrapping himself in the city.

The more Fang Mingyu pondered his current situation, the more desperate and helpless he felt.

In the end, Fang Mingyu decided to leave Nightless City. An inn was too conspicuous after all. He would search for a way out of Nightless City later.

Fang Mingyu changed his disguise before stepping out of his room.

Fang Mingyu barely took one step out from the inn, and his footsteps halted. At the end of the street stood more than a dozen Piercing Cult Moon’s experts blocking his path. Three of them were clad in the Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder’s robes.

Each of them exuded a more substantial pressure than him.

Fang Mingyu’s face tightened.

The Piercing Moon Cult’s people arrived so fast?

“Grand Elder Yang Jun, where are you going ah?” One of the Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elders asked with a sheepish smile as he stared fixedly at Fang Mingyu. “We were just about to look for you to have a few drinks.”

Fang Mingyu squeezed a smile on his face as he said, “What Grand Elder Yang Jun? I think you have got the wrong person.”

The three Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elders exchanged a glance then laughed a little too loud.

Some passersby noticed the tense atmosphere, and their curiosity was stoked. Thus more of them stopped to watch.

The first Piercing Moon Cult Grand Elder who spoke laughed, “Kiddo, I know you’re not Grand Elder Yang Jun, once we’ve captured you, we’ll know who you really are.”

Fang Mingyu’s face turned ash-gray. In the next moment, his body blurred in a flicker as he sped away. But his feet had just left the street when someone faster than him blocked his path. It was the same Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder, who had spoken earlier.

Fang Mingyu couldn’t even react, the other side’s actions were a series of blurry images, and in the next second, Fang Mingyu felt a dull pain as an overbearing force knocked him in the chest. He was lying on the street a moment later.

His cultivation was merely at the mid-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm while the Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder was a peak late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch. Against him, Fang Mingyu was powerless to resist.

The Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder landed lightly on his feet while looking at Fang Mingyu. He strode slowly until he reached Fang Mingyu. He looked at Fang Mingyu condescendingly and said with absolute coldness, “Take him away!”

“Yes.”

Other Piercing Moon Cult’s experts complied and stepped in to carry Fang Mingyu away.

However, just as these Piercing Moon Cult’s experts moved towards Fang Mingyu, suddenly, numerous sword qis shot towards them. These sword qis contained a terrifying death qi, and each ray of sword qi had a small, ethereal skull swirling around it.

The Piercing Moon Cults experts were alarmed as they dodged by reflex.

Many of them were injured by these sword qis and tumbled in the air by the sword qi force. For a moment, screams reverberated in the air.

The three Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elders’ faces darkened.

Fang Mingyu stood blankly for a second. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The others turned to look and saw a middle-aged man clad in the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Grand Elder’s robe sitting on a Thunder Bone Tiger mount coming towards them.

This person was naturally Huang Xiaolong.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong was clad in the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Grand Elder’s robe, the Piercing Moon Cult’s experts’ faces tightened nervously.

Huang Xiaolong stopped in front of Fang Mingyu as he rode on the Thunder Bone Tiger, while the Piercing Moon Cult’s experts gave way vigilantly.

“I am the Piercing Moon Cult’s Chen Dongyue, may I know who you are?” The peak mid-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder took a step forward and cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong.

“Luo Haoming.” Huang Xiaolong flatly stated.

“I see, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Grand Elder Luo Haoming. We suspect this person here killed our Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder Yang Jun, and our Head has ordered us to capture this person. Please make it convenient for us. I hope Grand Elder Luo Haoming won’t interfere in this matter. I will express my gratitude to Grand Elder Luo Haoming on another day.” Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder Chen Dongyue said politely.

If someone else had killed his Piercing Moon Cult’s disciples, Chen Dongyue would have retaliated, but due to Luo Haoming’s identity, he had to be polite.

“This person has a grudge with me, so I cannot give you this person. You can leave now.” Huang Xiaolong brushed off Chen Dongyue’s request.

Chen Dongyue and other Piercing Moon Cult’s experts’ faces turned ugly. Saying there was a grudge was merely an excuse.

“Are you bent on interfering in our Piercing Moon Cult’s affair?” Chen Dongyue regained his composure, but his thoughts were already swaying.
