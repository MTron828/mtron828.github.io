Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu and Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi’s attacks were blocked by the City of Eternity.

Bang! A thunderous explosion rang. The City of Eternity stood steady after the collision while Feng Chu and Lan Zhu were thrown several li back.

Even though Feng Chu and Lan Zhi’s strength had risen significantly by borrowing the Fiend King Star and Radiant Divine Armor’s power, they were no match against the City of Eternity controlled by one hundred high-level Undead Netherguards.

In the past, with the one hundred Undead Netherguards driving the City of Eternity, even the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang had to flee with heavy injuries. Feng Chu and Lan Zhi were nothing compared to him.

However, after the City of Eternity knocked Feng Chu and Lan Zhi back, it did not attack anymore. Instead, the City of Eternity flew further out and attacked one of the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s big planets.

The planet shattered into pieces under the City of Eternity’s powerful blow. Various formation arrays placed within and around the planet were destroyed by the City of Eternity in one blow. Yet the City of Eternity’s speed did not diminish at all, and it continued to ram forward.

In an instant, countless pieces of shattered mainlands ricocheted into space. Mountains and seas collapsed, and another planet was destroyed.

Seeing this, Feng Chu immediately understood Huang Xiaolong’s intention. He was infuriated. His ten blade-like fingers swiped towards Huang Xiaolong while he roared in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you?!”

If Huang Xiaolong continued to destroy these Fiend God Emperor Palace’s planets, the Grand Fiend God Formation would lose the nefarious qi support from the planets, weakening the formation’s power considerably. Not to mention, his strength would also drop drastically without the aid of these planets’ nefarious qi.

,It was obvious how the Fiend God Emperor Palace would end with the destruction of more palaces!

Huang Xiaolong looked at the infuriated Feng Chu attacking him in a frenzy, and he leaped back agilely while the two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels flew straight towards Feng Chu.

The two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels’ fourteen wings spread out majestically, forming a radiant energy wall barrier.

Feng Chu’s attack fell onto the fourteen-winged Radiance Angels’ wall barrier. The radiant energy wall barrier quivered and scattered away silently. Even so, Feng Chu’s attack was successfully blocked.

Weng—!

Unknowingly, the Heavenly Hall had appeared above Feng Chu’s head. The golden hexagon light pillar, brimming with radiant destructive power shot down.

Feng Chu pale as he swiftly retreated, escaping the area of the golden hexagon light pillar’s area of attack.

He had already witnessed its destructive power just now. If the golden light hit him, not even the nefarious qi of his body could completely block it. The injury was inevitable.

Feng Chu had barely dodged the attack when another wave of boundless radiant energy fell from space above. Feng Chu broke out in cold sweat, looking at the boundless radiant destructive energy falling from above, feeling he had survived a catastrophe.

While Feng Chu dodged the Heavenly Hall’s attack, a curtain of vigorous radiant sword qi suddenly slashed down on Huang Xiaolong.

Every radiant sword qi was powerful enough to pierce through a world surface.

The attacker was naturally the Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi trying to kill Huang Xiaolong in a sneak attack.

However, the curtain of radiant sword qi was blocked by the two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels with ease even before the attack got close to Huang Xiaolong.

When Lan Zhi’s powerful attack fell on the two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels’ barrier, it was akin to boulders sinking into the sea or raindrops falling into the ocean. It was completely assimilated into the barrier!

Lan Zhi was astounded.

What was going on?!

These two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels actually can absorb other radiant energy?

Then, thunderous booms sounded from the distance as another planet was destroyed by the City of Eternity, turning into numerous pieces of shattered mainland.

Every time a planet was destroyed, the Grand Fiend God Formation weakened by a degree, and the Fiend King controlled by the Fiend King’s consciousness weakened as well. Feng Chu’s strength was also affected.

Feng Chu bellowed as he rained tumultuous attacks on Huang Xiaolong.

He couldn’t stop the City of Eternity, therefore he could only lay his hope on killing Huang Xiaolong. ,The City of Eternity and Heavenly Hall would lose control once Huang Xiaolong died, and his dire situation would be reversed.

However, what enraged Feng Chu was, no matter how hard he and Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi attacked, it was blocked by the two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels.

Moreover, the Heavenly Hall would appear out of nowhere from time to time, scaring them out of their wits.

In the meantime, the Fiend God Emperor Palace and Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestors could only protect themselves by dodging the Heavenly Hall, much less think of attacking Huang Xiaolong.

....

Time flowed by.

Minutes became an hour.

The City of Eternity had destroyed several tens of planets that were part of the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Grand Fiend God Formation.

Though this amount of planets were nothing more than a few drops of water overall, the Fiend God formation lost the support of nefarious qi from these planets, which caused a small hole in it.

On another side, the Fiend King’s body that was suppressed by the two odd beasts was now at a disadvantage. If this continued, it wouldn’t take long for the Fiend King to be defeated and get scattered!

The loss of the Fiend King condensed from the nefarious qi would only result in the six Emperor Palaces’ Ancestors’ death. No one would be left to deal with the two odd beasts. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Chu and Lan Zhi grew anxious and hurriedly attacked in desperation.

However, the two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels successfully blocked all of their attacks.

Another hour passed inside the Grand Fiend God Formation.

By the time the Fiend God Emperor Palace lost a hundred planets, the Grand Fiend God Formation had weakened significantly once again. The Fiend King’s consciousness’ huge figure took a punch from both odd beasts and smashed into the distance. A large portion of nefarious qi scattered away from his body.

“Huang Xiaolong, since you aim to rescue Fang Gan, I’m willing to return Fang Gan to you. You can take him away!” Feng Chu screamed. “We will never cross each other’s path in the future, agreed? Our Fiend God Emperor Palace’s disciples will retreat ten thousand li if they encounter you in the future!”

Seeing the situation growing from bad to worse, Feng Chu finally relented.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, hearing that. “What? You don’t want to kill me now and get those peerless treasures on me—the heart of hell, and sixteen wings anymore? I will definitely take away Fan Gan. I can leave if you want me to, as long as all of you submit to me and offer the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s treasury and Brightness Emperor Palace’s treasury!”

Feng Chu and Lan Zhi’s fury was beyond eruption.

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t go overboard!” Feng Chu shouted.

As Emperor of an Emperor Palace, both Feng Chu and Lan Zhi were used to others begging them, summoning the winds and calling for rain with a wave of their hands. Now, not only did Huang Xiaolong reject their offer, but he also demanded additional terms and conditions! Not only did Huang Xiaolong want the Fiend God Emperor Palace and Brightness Emperor Palace’s treasuries, but he also had the guts to ask them to surrender to him. Putting it in ugly words, it meant becoming Huang Xiaolong’s slaves!

Feng Chu’s eyes were bloodshot as he stared furiously at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, you’re the one who forced me—let’s die together then!” In the next second, his entire body’s nefarious qi surged violently.

This nefarious qi condensed into various figures of fiends.

Each of these fiends exuded shocking momentum.
