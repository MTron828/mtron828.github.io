Huang Xiaolong and the others gulped audibly. A peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm cultivator still wasn’t qualified to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court?

In other words, only those above the Ancestor God Realm were qualified. Moreover, they merely had the qualifications to participate!

“In truth, our Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate is just a branch.” Subsequently, the Fortune Gate Chief added another sentence.

Both Huang Xiaolong and Li Lu were genuinely shocked, the Fortune Gate they were currently at was merely a branch of the main sect?

Golden Brow Ancestor added, “The Divine World has seventy to eighty thousand Fortune Gate branches similar to ours. Among these branches, our Vientiane World’s branch is ranked somewhere around thirty thousand. The overall force of our Fortune Gate’s headquarters isn’t something you can imagine at this point!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t calm down after hearing this information. The Divine World actually had seventy to eighty thousand branches similar to the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate!

Not to mention the fact that they were ranked somewhere around the thirty thousands.

“Then, where is the main sect located?” Li Lu asked.

“This you will know after you breakthrough to the Ancestor God Realm, it’s useless to know about it now.” Myriad Flames Ancestor said, shaking his head.

Ancestor God Realm! Huang Xiaolong’s fists were tightly clenched with determination.

He understood the underlying meaning of Myriad Flames Ancestor’s words. Unless they reached the Ancestor God Realm, they didn’t even qualify to know the location of the main Fortune Gate!

Strength! He needed to become stronger!

Although he had advanced to peak mid-Second Order Ancient God Realm, in the vast Divine World his strength was still too low. He must strive to breakthrough to the Ancestor God Realm as soon as possible!

“Alright, now that Xiaolong has successfully broken through, everyone should disperse.” Golden Brow Ancestor said.

Everyone nodded before leaving in different directions.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor stopped Huang Xiaolong before he left and had him accompany them to Blood Knife’s cultivation palace as they had something to say to him.

Coming to the main hall, all three took a seat.

Blood Knife Ancestor had a wide smile on his face as he said, “Xiaolong, the fact that you could reach peak mid-Second Order Ancient God Realm in one go has exceeded our expectations, but you still need to make every effort to raise your strength. Strive to breakthrough to early Third Order Ancient God Realm before the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle!”

Golden Brow Ancestor added in agreement, “That’s right. Based on your True Dragon Physique, if you could reach early Third Order Ancient God Realm, you might be able to fight You Wuxin, perhaps win second place. The second place’s reward is much nicer than the third place.”

Huang Xiaolong could only nod his head and agree.

Blood Knife Ancestor laughed looking at Huang Xiaolong’s expression. “During the apprenticeship ceremony, the two of us did not prepare any gifts for you. Since you advanced straight to peak mid-Second Order Ancient God Realm, tell us what gift you want.”

Seemingly agreeing with Blood Knife’s words, Golden Brow Ancestor smiled softly as he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts raced. A second later, he asked, “Disciple wants to refine a kind of chaos spiritual pill, but is lacking three kinds of chaos spiritual herbs, the Golden Radiant Needle Mushroom, Deep Sea Crystal, and Enigmatic Yang Thistle.”

Blood Knife Ancestor pondered slightly before saying, “I have the Golden Radiant Needle Mushroom, but not the other two.” A small light flashed as Blood Knife took out an entirely translucent golden mushroom that emitted gentle light element force.

Delight rose to Huang Xiaolong’s face as he received the Golden Radiant Needle Mushroom from Blood Knife Ancestor’s hand.

In truth, Huang Xiaolong was just saying it out loud, he did not expect Blood Knife Ancestor to really have one of the chaos spiritual herbs. Even though there was only one, it saved him from searching high and low for it.

Golden Brow Ancestor asked, “I have neither the Deep Sea Crystal or Enigmatic Yang Thistle, what else do you want other than these?”

Huang Xiaolong threw all politeness out the window, saying, “Disciple is currently searching for chaos grade five-colored heaven refining stone, as well as chaos green flame spiritual liquid, chaos ice jade spiritual liquid...” In a single breath, Huang Xiaolong gave over a dozen names of chaos spiritual liquids that he needed to repair the Pill Blending Tower.

The long list rendered Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor dumbfounded.

“What do you want to do with so much chaos spiritual liquid?!” Golden Brow Ancestor couldn’t help blurting out in a high tone.

“Some years back, disciple obtained a divine artifact in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, but it was damaged. In order to repair it, chaos grade five-colored heaven refining stone, and various types of chaos spiritual liquid are needed.” Huang Xiaolong answered frankly.

Repairing a damaged divine artifact required so many precious types of chaos spiritual liquid? Golden Brow and Blood Knife exchanged a glance.

“Is your divine artifact a top rank chaos grade spiritual artifact?” Blood Knife Ancestor asked. “However, wasting over a dozen types of chaos spiritual liquid to repair a damaged top rank chaos grade grade spiritual artifact isn’t worth it!” Shaking his head, Blood Knife Ancestor added, “Moreover, chaos grade five-colored heaven refining stone is hard to find even in a hundred million years, finding it is harder than ascending to Heaven!”

“Take out your divine artifact, let me have a look.” Golden Brow Ancestor said.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t at all worried that his two Masters would be able to recognize the Pill Blending Tower’s origin, thus, without any hesitation, he took it out for them to see.

Looking at the ugly little tower with big and small cracks all over its body, lacking any extraordinary aura, Golden Brow and Blood Knife were feeling a little speechless.

Huang Xiaolong wanted to repair such a little tower with rare and precious chaos grade five-colored heaven refining stone and various kinds of chaos spiritual liquid?!

Blood Knife Ancestor couldn’t help saying, “Xiaolong, this little tower... are you sure it needs chaos grade five-colored heaven refining stone and over a dozen types of chaos spiritual liquid to repair it?” Neither of them could see what was precious about this ugly little tower.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, a wry smile on his face, “Probably, yes.” That was what the little cow said, but it couldn’t be wrong, right?

Golden Brow Ancestor hesitated for a second before taking out four bottles from his spatial ring and said to Huang Xiaolong, “These are four types of chaos spiritual liquid that are on your list, as for the chaos grade five-colored heaven refining stone and the other types of chaos spiritual liquid, I don’t have them. However, you can try the Infinite Circles Commerce Hall. Some years back, I bought two kinds of chaos spiritual liquid from them.”

“The Infinite Circles Commerce Hall?” Huang Xiaolong repeated.

Blood Knife Ancestor nodded, “This Infinite Circles Commerce Hall is one of our Divine World’s super trading houses. They have more than ten million branches scattered over thousands of Divine World surfaces, and they also have a branch in our Vientiane World, located on Wu Island.

More than ten million branches!

Huang Xiaolong was slightly astonished, this Infinite Circles Commerce Hall’s force covered so many Divine World surfaces!

Following that, Huang Xiaolong asked about Wu Island and its location, which wasn’t far from the Fortune Mainland. Hence, Huang Xiaolong decided to stop by there a few days later on his way back to Green Cloud Island.

Before that, he wanted to go over to the Sans Devil Stele and try refining it if he could.

He then asked Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor other questions before taking his leave. Walking out from the Assembly Shrine, Huang Xiaolong saw Zhou Xu, Tan Lin, and Luo Yunjie. The three of them were standing on the terrace in front of the Sans Devil Stele. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In front of the stele, the three young men’s faces were scrunched up in frustration. The three of them had most likely tried all methods they could think of, but there was no reaction from the Sans Devil Stele.

In a few steps, Huang Xiaolong reached the terrace.

Luo Yunjie noticed Huang Xiaolong’s presence and greeted him. His action could be considered as amiable, whereas Zhou Xu and Tan Lin both harrumphed, then ignored Huang Xiaolong.
