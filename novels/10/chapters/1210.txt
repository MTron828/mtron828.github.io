Huang Xiaolong, Song Chengli, and Liu Zhuo were already Ancient God Realm masters. Their flying speed was faster than the flying ships. Therefore, they didn’t consider taking South Huai City’s flying ships services from Green Cloud Island to Dralion Island.

Huang Xiaolong’s group flew past South Huai City and half a day later, they arrived at Dralion Island’s Golden Dragon Gate.

Golden Dragon Gate Grand Elders and Elders had long been waiting for Huang Xiaolong, Song Chengli, and Liu Zhuo’s arrival.

Among the welcoming party, Huang Xiaolong spotted Liu Qingyang— the person who had sent someone to kill him.

While Liu Qingyang, the Golden Dragon Gate Grand Elders and Elders were inwardly guessing Huang Xiaolong’ identity; Huang Xiaolong spoke to Liu Qingyang, “Grand Elder Liu Qingyang....”

Gazes from all around turned to Liu Qingyang. Liu Qingyang was stunned, but he asked politely, “Senior do you know of me?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Do you still remember your Golden Dragon Gate disciple, Tang Hong?”

Tang Hong!

Liu Qing Yang’s heart tightened nervously; laughing innocently, he said, “Senior is joking. There are hundreds and thousands of Golden Dragon Gate disciples.It is not possible for this Liu Qingyang to remember every disciple’s name.”

A knowing smile flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Is that so?” But Huang Xiaolong did not pursue the matter further and continued flying into the Golden Dragon Gate great hall with Song Chengli, Liu Zhou, and the rest.

As the Golden Dragon Gate had prepared a banquet early on, Huang Xiaolong had to participate in it, if not he would have to see Song Chengli and Liu Zhou’s disappointed expressions.

Golden Dragon Gate Grand Elders and Elders were astounded when they saw that Ancestor Song Chengli and Gate Chief Liu Zhou invited Huang Xiaolong to take the main seat, whereas they both took the lower seat.

Seeing shocked faces around him and after receiving Huang Xiaolong’s permission, Song Chengli announced, “This is our Fortune Mainland All-Islands Great War first place, Senior Huang Xiaolong!”

In an instant, gasps of shock echoed in the great hall. No doubt Song Chengli’s words had astounded the present Golden Dragon Gate Grand Elders and Elders.

The All-Islands Great War had ended about a year ago. The news that Barbarian God Sect’s Huang Xiaolong had won the first place had spread through various sects and forces big and small.

Any forces that have qualifications to participate in the All-Islands Great War knew about this.

After learning Huang Xiaolong’s identity, Golden Dragon Gate’s Grand Elders and Elders respectfully toasted to Huang Xiaolong, except for Liu Qingyang who seemed like he was sitting on needles. Dread tightened around his heart as he tried to guess when Tang Hong would have met Huang Xiaolong. What was the connection between them?

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as he noticed Liu Qingyang’s unease.

The next day morning, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow strengthened the Golden Dragon Gate’s grand defense formation, increasing the defensive formation’s power over by many times.

On the third day, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow left Dralion Island flying towards the Nefarious Devil Tribe Island. As for Liu Qingyang, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to deal with him personally, thus he left this task to Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo.

After leaving Dralion Island, Huang Xiaolong summoned out the chaos spiritual beast Black Baboon to carry him and the little cow to the Nefarious Devil Tribe Island. Based on the Black Baboon’s speed, they could reach their destination in a day.

It was already noon when Huang Xiaolong left Dralion Island. Five to six hours later, the sky gradually darkened.

“There’s an island up ahead. Should we go and have a look?” The little cow asked Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement, “That’s a good idea, we’ll rest here for the night and continue tomorrow.” He then sent the chaos spiritual beast Black Baboon back and rode on the little cow, heading to the island that was not far ahead.

But when they got closer to the island, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow heard screams and angry shouts.

“The Black Devil Battle Armor is my family’s ancestral item, you cannot take it away!”

“Your ass of an ancestral item? Our interest in the armor is your honor! Also, you can get lost now, and the girl stays!”

Subsequently there were furious bellows and intense clashes of a battle.

Huang Xiaolong frowned, his legs nudging the little cow to increase its speed.

A few moments later, Huang Xiaolong saw that above the island in front of him, there was a group of disciples clad in brocade crimson-gold robes. They were besieging a black brocade-robed young man, and not far from them, stood two disciples in Ouyang Family robes who were forcefully holding two female disciples captive. It was obvious these two female disciples were together with the black brocade-robed young man.

Ouyang Family! Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed dangerously.

Looking at the situation in front of him and thinking of what Gu Ling had mentioned earlier, Huang Xiaolong immediately understood what was going on.

‘Looks like the crimson-gold disciples’ force has submitted to Ouyang Clan. Ouyang Family is therefore, forcefully collecting toll on this part of the sea region!

The black brocade-robed young man’s strength was not bad. It was at peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm cultivation, however, the group of crimson-red robe disciples besieging him were not weak. either They averaged at Ninth Order Heavenly God Realm strength. And soon, the young man was laden with injuries.

If this continues, in less than ten minutes, this young man is dead for certain. Huang Xiaolong patted the little cow’s head. The little cow responded— seemingly without any action—merely a purple lightning flashed in its eyes. The group of crimson-gold robe disciples was sent flying in various directions. Their bodies charred black with fine streaks of purple lightning occasionally crackling.

This was too sudden that everyone was stunned. The two Ouyang Family disciples were astonished and they turned towards Huang Xiaolong’s to look at him.

“Punk, who are you? Dare to stick your nose in our Ouyang Family’s business!” One of the Ouyang Family disciples pointed at Huang Xiaolong and scolded while trying to conceal his apprehension.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to waste his time with this nonsense. With a casual lift of his hand, the Ouyang Family disciple was split into two halves.

The other Ouyang Family disciple was deathly terrified.

“Go back and tell Ouyang Bin Ouyang Xuguang, soon, I, Huang Xiaolong, will reap their lives.” Huang Xiaolong coldly stated.

“Get lost!”

Huang Xiaolong!

When the Ouyang Family disciple heard Huang Xiaolong’s name, his body trembled violently but quickly fled in fear.

“Senior is none other than the All-Islands Great War first place winner, Senior Huang Xiaolong!” The black-robed young man knelt in front of Huang Xiaolong, speaking respectfully. “This one is Nine Palaces Cult’s Lin Chen, I am deeply grateful for Senior’s saving grace!”Looking at Huang Xiaolong, there was reverence in Lin Chen’s eyes.

The other two female disciples knelt in gratitude.

Huang Xiaolong had the three of them rise and checked on their condition. Then, he had them leave the island. The three disciples thanked Huang Xiaolong once again before flying away.

“Then, are we still resting on the island up ahead” The little cow pointed to the front.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No, continue onwards.”

Since the island’s forces had submitted to Ouyang Family, it would be nothing but trouble resting on that island. Huang Xuiaolong did not wish to delay any further.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong summoned the chaos spiritual beast Balck Baboon out again, continuing towards their destination.

Deep into the night, thick cold and eerie fog dominated the air above the Nefarious Devil Tribe Island.

Black fog roiled, intimidating trespassers.

Under the dim greenish moonlight, several figures appeared above the Nefarious Devil Tribe Island. They were none other than Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the Black Baboon.

Concealing their presence, in a turn of space teleportation, three figures flickered in and out under the moonlit sky.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had been there before. Due to their familiarity with the terrain, they arrived at the Nefarious Devil Tribe ancestral burial ground within a short time of five hours.

The sky was still dark when they reached the Yama Plains where the ancestral burial ground was located. So much thick death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy roiled, that one could barely see their fingers.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
