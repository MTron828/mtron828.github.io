From the time he entered the Kingdom of Devil Beasts, Huang Xiaolong had been traveling on the Tushita Flying Ship. It could be said that he knew nothing of the current affairs. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong wanted to enter the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire’s capital city, mostly when he was completely ignorant of the current situation between the Devil Race and Kingdom of Devil Beasts. Thus, entering the city to gather information was the best way.

Then again, he wouldn’t stay long in this Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire’s capital city, one night at most. They would resume their journey the next day.

The Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire’s pursuers would appear at any time. Hence, this was the main reason why he could not linger in one place for too long.

Upon entering the Violet Python Capital City, Huang Xiaolong, and the others first went to settle their accommodation.

Huang Xiaolong then gave Gao Changran and Wang Fanning one million low-grade chaos spirit stones each before sending them off to gather information. He encouraged them that there was no need to save any spirit stones.

As long as the information was worth it, it didn’t matter the price.

Gao Changran and Wang Fanning respectfully complied and went out.

Huang Xiaolong remained at the residence to cultivate while he waited for the information from Gao Changran and Wang Fanning upon their return. In the last few days, after popping more than a handful of Great Brahma Sarira Pill, the injuries he had gotten from Shi Ming’s attacks had almost healed completely. Hence, it was only a matter of time when he returned to his peak condition.

Gao Changran and Wang Fanning returned a few hours later.

With sufficient low-grade chaos spirit stones in their pockets, Gao Changran and Wang Fanning had managed to obtain some useful information.

One of the information they had gotten was related to Shi Ming, Chu Han, Feng Chu, Xing Tian, Violent Lightning, and Chen Xie’s whereabouts.

Shi Ming, Chu Han, and Feng Chu, as well as the Silver Devil Sect’s people, were seen in the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire. They had even fought with the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire’s experts.

The Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire was the strongest empire in the entire Kingdom of Devil Beasts. The Two-headed Devil Dragon’s Great Emperor, Long Baiyi, was the devil beasts’ most powerful expert.

There were casualties on Shi Ming and the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire’s side.

Whereas Xing Tian, Violent Lightning, and Chen Xie’s group did not act together with Shi Ming, Chu Han, and Feng Chu. Xing Tian and Violent Lightning were seen around the Metal Mountains. They even killed several Metal Mountain native tribes’ Patriarchs.

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly relieved hearing Xing Tian was not together with Shi Ming. As long as Shi Ming and Xing Tian were not in the same group, it was less dangerous for him.

Gao Changran and Wang Fanning went on to report to Huang Xiaolong other information they had gathered.

After the Mara Plains’ miasma stopped spewing, six of the Devil World’s Archdevil Ancestors had crossed the Mara Plains, entering the Kingdom of Devil Beasts with their teams. Apart from these six teams, some hidden ancient forces such as the Hundred Transformation Sect, Taiji Devil Sect, and Emperor Devil Gate had also formed teams and entered the Kingdom of Devil Beasts.

The majority of Devil World’s first-ranked families and sects in the thirty-six regions had also entered the Kingdom of Devil Beasts.

Due to the generations of feuds between the Devil Race and devil beasts, news of scuffles and killings between the two sides had increased drastically in recent days.

There was news of Emperor Realm Ancestor’s death circulating every day.

Even Emperor Realm Ancestors were dying, the casualties among the Heavenly Monarch Realm geniuses were naturally greater.

The Kingdom of Devil Beasts was swept up in the carnage.

Then again, the Devil Race was at a disadvantage on this part of the land, and their losses were still greater.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. The appearance of the two devil steles had stirred the entire Devil World into chaos. This was just the beginning, yet blood was already flowing like a river.

“Your Majesty, I also heard another news.” Gao Changran paused in hesitation, “... A few days ago, the Yin Crow Sect also sent a group over this side. But they were besieged after the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire discovered them. The Yin Crow Sect’s Young Lord and several Yin Crow Sect’s disciples were killed on the spot.”

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback by the information.

Other than the Six Nether Gate, the Yin Crow Sect and Rear Demon Cult were also part of the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s hidden forces in the Devil World. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When Huang Xiaolong had first arrived at the Eternal Devil City, he had not summoned Yin Crow Sect and Rear Demon Cult’s experts to keep their connection with the Netherworld King’s Organization a secret.

“What about the rest? Where’s the Yin Crow Sect’s Chief?” Huang Xiaolong asked with a sullen expression.

“There were thirty plus experts in the Yin Crow Sect’s group, and almost all of them were killed by the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire’s experts. Currently, only the Yin Crow Sect’s Chief and three Ancestors are still alive, but they are imprisoned in a certain secret location somewhere in the capital city. The word is that the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire plans to execute the four of them tomorrow in public on top of the city walls!”

Huang Xiaolong furrowed deeper as he listened on.

Since he knew about this matter now, naturally, he couldn’t pretend otherwise and do nothing about it.

After all, the Yin Crow Sect was a force under the Netherworld King’s Organisation. Hao Changran, the Yin Crow Sect’s Chief, and Rear Demon Cult’s Leader had been loyal to the Netherworld King’s Organisation. Because of this, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t sit back and watch them being executed in public.

“Did you find out where they are being imprisoned?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“...This, your subordinate failed to find out.” Gao Changran shook his head despondently.

Gao Changran was aware of the Yin Crow Sect and Rear Demon Cult’s connection with the Netherworld King’s Organisation. This had prompted him to report the matter to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. At the moment, their best option was to wait for the next day’s arrival, when Yin Crow Sect’s Chief and Ancestors would be led to the Violet Python Capital City’s city walls before taking action.

“Your Majesty, we don’t have to wait until tomorrow to rescue them.” Wang Fanning suddenly interjected.

“Oh, what makes you say that?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Your Majesty, we’ve found out that the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire’s Crown Prince Huo Liuyun would visit the Female Emperor Pavilion.” Gao Changran chuckled.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up as he immediately understood the meaning of Gao Changran’s words. Kidnap Huo Liuyun and exchange him for the Yin Crow Sect’s fur people. But Huang Xiaolong’s focus at the moment was, “Female Emperor Pavilion?”

“It’s a brothel.” Gao Changran stated simply. “Huo Liuyun goes to the Female Emperor Pavilion to see a woman called Hu Qianmei. She is said to be a great beauty, the Kingdom of Devil Beasts’ number one beauty. She has many admirers among the empires’ crown princes. She is skilled in playing musical instruments and well-versed in many ancient songs that captivate the audience. On top of that, listening to her songs could nurture and cleanse the soul, making a person want more.”

Huang Xiaolong was speechless.

He couldn’t believe that the grand-sounding Female Emperor Pavilion was actually a brothel, and Huo Liuyun’s purpose was to see Hu Qianmei.

This Hu Qianmei must be really beautiful, and not so simple. Or else, as the Crown Prince of Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire, Huo Liuyun wouldn’t fall into such depravity.

“Huo Liuyun is at the Female Emperor Pavilion right now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“He should be there if we head over to the Female Emperor Pavilion now. He would have arrived not too long ago.” Gao Changran replied.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Lu Xiaoqing’s group of four and asked, “Do you have any opinion?”

Lu Xiaoqing and the other three replied in a hurry, “We follow Your Majesty’s order.”

“Good, then let’s head to the Female Emperor Pavilion now.” Huang Xiaolong stated as he stood up.

Gao Changran and the rest complied respectfully.

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong’s group stepped out from the residence and left in the direction of the Female Emperor Pavilion.

As the Female Emperor Pavilion was merely a short distance away from their residence, and the speed of Huang Xiaolong’s group was fast, they reached the Female Emperor Pavilion roughly an hour later. Moreover, they arrived before Huo Liuyun.

Upon arriving, Huang Xiaolong stated clearly to the brothel hostess that he wanted to see Hu Qianmei.

But the brothel hostess showed a troubled expression as she spoke, “Young Master, this is troubling, Miss Hu Qianmei has a daily booking with Crown Prince Huo Liuyun, and Crown Prince Huo Liuyun would be arriving soon, so we...” Her subsequent words were cut off before she could finish. Her eyes rounded as she stared at the spatial ring in Huang Xiaolong’s palm.

Inside that spatial ring, low-grade chaos spirit stones were piled several mountains high. Waves of spiritual energy rushed past her. The purity of the spiritual energy nearly suffocated her.
