Chapter 3031: That Only Proves That He’s a Glutton

When the members of the Devil Curse Creed surrounded Peng Fei and Jia Zhen, someone couldn’t help but step forward to mock them. “Aren’t you guys Peng Fei and Jia Zhen from the Leiyu Creed? Did everyone important in the creed die? Why would they allow two puny little Primal Ancestors to waste their time in Xuan City?” One had to know that the person who spoke was also a Primal Ancestor.

With his expression sinking, Peng Fei growled, “Xue Fei, you’re a Primal Ancestor too. If you can come, why can’t we?”

Raising his eyebrows casually, Xue Fei sneered, “You must be so full of yourself. Who do you think you are? With nothing but pieces of shit in the Leiyu Creed, all of you are lucky to be protected by the Golden Fox Dao Venerable. Otherwise, we would have long since exterminated your creed! No! We would have killed you guys a hundred times over!”

Seeing as the members of the Devil Curse Creed were blocking their path, Jia Zhen growled, “Get out of the way, please.”

Xue Fei snorted in response, “If you wish to pass, you’ll have to crawl through my legs.” As soon as he spoke, he stood before Jia Zhen and opened his legs wide.

Laughter erupted all around them, and the faces of Peng Fei and Jia Zheng sank.

“Xue Fei, you're going too far!” Jia Zhen roared in rage. “We are under orders from our young master to look for a place to stay.”

“Did that fellow, Zhou Kang, come to Xuan City? If Zhou Hong and the other two old b*stards are here, we might have just let you off. If Zhou Kang is the only one who came… Hehehe, we don’t give half a sh*t about him!”

Zhou Kang was precisely Zhou Hong’s son, and he was the young patriarch of the Leiyu Creed. He was a half-step Dao Venerable, and he was also the first person who sprung to their mind when Jia Zhen spoke about their ‘young master’.

With an unsightly expression, Peng Fei and Jia Zhen looked at each other. The members of the Devil Curse Creed wouldn’t dare to insult them to the face. Who would have thought that they would act so arrogantly the moment they met?

“Do it!” Xue Fei ordered the disciples behind him. “As long as they’re not dead, it’s fine!”

The two of them failed to react when the disciples of the Devil Curse Creed came at them. They were stronger than average disciples, but they were overwhelmed by the sheer number of people coming from the Devil Curse Creed.

Even after they were sent flying, the assailants didn’t let up.

…

In the Heaven Seizing Inn…

Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu demolished all one hundred bowls before them.

Looking at how the two of them did it, the experts in the restaurant were shocked beyond belief.

“One… One hundred bowls?! Even if they’re Dao Venerables, they shouldn’t be able to eat a hundred bowls, right?!” An expert from the Five Seas Creed muttered.

The Five Seas Creed might sound like a superpower, but they were ranked thirty-second in the region.

“Fifty bowls per person… They’re definitely high-level Dao Venerables!”

“That might not be true. They might have trained their body to the extreme, allowing them to devour fifty bowls each!”

Discussion rang across the hall, and the duo ignored all of them as Lei Yu called for the attendant once again.

When he ordered another hundred bowls, a frown formed on their faces as they looked at Peng Fei and Jia Zhen rushing into the restaurant with swollen faces.

“Your Highness, Lord Beast!” The two of them fell to their knees the moment they arrived, and a look of shame crept up their faces.

“What’s going on?” Lei Yu growled.

“The disciples of the Devil Curse Creed stopped us along the way!” Peng Fei’s body trembled as he didn’t dare to raise his head to look at Huang Xiaolong.

“Your Highness, they took everything from us! Even the one hundred million dao coins you gave us was taken away!” Jia Zhen slammed his head into the ground in apology. “We are willing to accept any punishment for our mistake!”

That was a hundred million dao coins they were talking about. Even their lives weren’t worth that much!

The experts sitting in the restaurant erupted when they heard the report.

“Are they from the Leiyu Creed?”

“That’s not possible. We will recognize any experts the Leiyu Creed sends. They are definitely not from the Leiyu Creed, but they might be related in some way!’ Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“A hundred million dao coins were stolen! If I were them, I would kill the two Primal Ancestors with a single slap!”

No one could believe what had just happened.

“Oh? Devil Curse Creed…” Huang Xiaolong sighed before allowing them to get to their feet. “Get up. It’s just a hundred million. It doesn’t matter if you lose it.”

The jaws of everyone in the Heaven Seizing Inn dropped.

Doesn’t matter if they lose it?!

Peng Fei and Jia Zhen were ready to die when they made the report. They were stunned when Huang Xiaolong pardoned them.

“Your Highness, we…” Peng Fei looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

“Since His Highness pardoned you, just get up,” Lei Yu spoke as a chilly light flashed through his eyes. “The Devil Curse Creed seems to be tired of living!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered.

They weren’t on their way to exterminate the Devil Curse Creed and the other party was already knocking on their door.

Waving his hand, a ray of light containing the power of nirvana landed on their bodies. In the blink of an eye, they were brought back to their peak state. Looking at themselves, they were shocked by their recovery speed.

“Your Highness, are we going to deal with them now?” Lei Yu looked at Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t know if Huang Xiaolong wanted him to go kill them all with a single slap.

“Forget it. They’re just a bunch of ants. After the auction ends, we’ll kill them all.”

Lei Yu nodded slowly.

In the corner, an expert from the Panhu Creed heard what they said and sneered, “What a loser. A hundred million was stolen by the other party, and he doesn’t even dare to fart in their direction.”

“The Devil Curse Dao Venerable is a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable. There are several dozen mid-level Dao Venerables under his command, and it’s no wonder he doesn’t dare to do anything to them.” Experts at another table from the Devil Blade Creed chuckled.

Their factions were ranked eighth and eleventh, respectively, and they were a force to be reckoned with. They were stronger than the Leiyu Creed, and they were eager to embarrass Huang Xiaolong. After all, Huang Xiaolong had flaunted his wealth after entering the Heaven Seizing Inn and they were happy to see that he lost a hundred million.

The experts from the two factions didn’t keep their voices low, and everyone in the restaurant heard them. People started to lower their heads to laugh as they mocked Huang Xiaolong for being an incompetent fool.

“Do you really think you’re strong because you have the cash to back it up? Do you really think you’re an expert after eating fifty bowls of Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice?” The expert from the Panhu Creed sneered. “I can also eat fifty bowls if I want to!”

The expert from the Devil Blade Creed clapped and roared with laughter, “Brother Chen Huo is right! Eating fifty bowls of Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice only shows that you’re a glutton!”
