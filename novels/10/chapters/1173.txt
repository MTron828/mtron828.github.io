When Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the square, many participants and various sects’ experts were already there.

Yao Chi, Lu Zhuo, and the others weren’t allowed on the square, so they stood outside to spectate, just like other sects’ experts.

Among the Green Cloud Island’s five participating disciples, Huang Xiaolong was the only one who had entered the top five thousand in the preliminary round, which was why he walked in the square alone. However, just as he stepped inside, he felt a sinister gaze following him. Looking toward the source, Huang Xiaolong saw Ouyang Yunfei in the distance.

Ouyang Yunfei and the other four participants from the Ouyang Clan were standing beside the Twin Cities Sect’s group.

Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed by this sight, musing to himself ’Looks like Ouyang Clan managed to hook onto the Twin Cities Sect.’

On the other side, Ouyang Yunfei sent a provoking gaze when he saw Huang Xiaolong looking over. The corner of his lips curved into a cold sneer as he walked over to the Twin Cities Sect’s Tan Lin before his cold sneer turned into a flattering smile, “Senior Brother Tan Lin, that’s Huang Xiaolong, the one who bet three hundred billion on Zhou Xu not winning the first place.”

Tan Lin and the present Twin Cities Sect disciples followed Ouyang Yunfei’s gaze and looked at Huang Xiaolong.

The Twin Cities Sect’s Yang Liming looked at Huang Xiaolong and mocked, “So, it was this punk.”

Tan Lin directed a confused look at Yang Liming asking, “Junior Brother Yang knows this kid?”

Yang Liming shook his head, “I can’t say I know him. On the day the preliminary round ended, this punk told his woman not to worry, as he would get the Blue Flaming Heart Fruit. Aat that time, I was nearby and heard what he said.”

All the Twin Cities Sect disciples let out a whoop of laughter.

“This punk bet three hundred billion on Zhou Xu not winning first place, does he think the first place is already his?” A Twin Cities Sect disciple mocked.

Tan Lin shook his head, "I didn’t expect him to be a delusional fool, overestimating himself.” Other than this, he could not think of a more apt description.

“However, where did a mere Barbarian God Sect disciple get three hundred billion?” Yang Liming’s eyes glimmered with doubt, “Did this punk get some ancient treasures?” Speaking of this, his eyes shone brightly.

Tan Lin and the others had a look of anticipation as well.

Yang Liming decisively approached Huang Xiaolong and came to a stop right in front of him, showing a cold smile, “Punk, I didn’t imagine you were so rich, it seems you found an ancient treasure. As long as you hand over the treasure, we’ll consider being merciful when you meet me or any Twin Cities Sect disciples.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Yang Liming like he was looking at a fool, throwing out one word: “Idiot.”

“What?!” Yang Liming’s face warped in anger and godforce burst out madly from his body.

The atmosphere around the Twin Cities Sect disciples in the distance turned palpitating cold in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong directly ignored Yang Liming, looking away.

“Good! Punk, you’re dead now!” Yang Liming forcefully suppressed his anger and spat out the words one by one. Participants were not allowed to fight on the square, otherwise their competition qualification would be revoked. Therefore, he could only endure for now, wait until the stage battle began, he was going to make sure this Huang Xiaolong will die miserably.

Yang Liming returned to the Twin Cities Sect group.

The other participants who watched the whole exchange both consciously and subconsciously moved away from Huang Xiaolong, afraid that the Twin Cities Sect would think they were close to Huang Xiaolong.

Noticing this behavior, Huang Xiaolong snickered. This suited him just fine, his ears would have some peace.

“It’s you!” All of a sudden, a surprise exclamation rang in the square.

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder. Hu Dan, one of the Golden Dragon Gate ‘s Twin Golden Dragons, was walking toward him with a happy smile.

Seeing it was Hu Dan, Huang Xiaolong nodded his head at her with a faint smile.

After the preliminary round ended, Huang Xiaolong took a glance at the ranking list, finding Hu Dan’s name in the top five hundred. Hence, he wasn’t surprised to meet her here.

Standing in front of Huang Xiaolong, Hu Dan smiled brightly, “Hello, my name is Hu Dan, thank you for saving me. You left too quickly, I didn’t have the time to thank you.” Saying this, Hu Dan’s eyes glimmered with goodwill toward Huang Xiaolong.

After returning from the preliminary round, she especially asked her Holden Dragon Gate Ancestor and Gate Chief about Huang Xiaolong’s identity. After she described his features to them, Hu Dan didn’t expect both elders to clam their mouths tight, unwilling to disclose the black-haired young man’s identity.

This caused her curiosity toward Huang Xiaolong to soar.

In short, this black-haired young man was overly mysterious in her eyes.

Huang Xiaolong smiled at her, “A simple helping hand, no need to be polite. I’m familiar with your Gate Chief and Ancestor, helping you is something I should do. I am Huang Xiaolong.” When the final round would begin, Hu Dan would know his name, Huang Xiaolong saw no point in hiding it.

“You are that Huang Xiaolong?” Hu Dan’s mouth was agape hearing Huang Xiaolong’s name, obviously not expecting it. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A Barbarian God Sect named Huang Xiaolong placed a three hundred billion bet, she had also heard about this.

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly and said, “It seems I’m quite famous.”

Hu Dan realized that her question seemed a bit rude and smiled to cover her embarrassment.

A while later, all five thousand participants arrived at the square, followed by the appearance of Elder Gong Fei.

Standing on the stage, Gong Fei first congratulated the top five thousand disciples who successfully entered the final round, then went on to state the final round’s stage battle rules.

The final round was divided into three days. On the first day, four thousand out of five thousand participants would be eliminated, while the remaining one thousand participants would be accepted into the sect, officially becoming Fortune Gate disciples.

The second part of the battle stage would take place the next day, and the top one hundred would be accepted as Fortune Gate Elders’ personal disciples. The status and benefits of these personal disciples were like heaven and earth compared to the common disciples.

The stage battles on the third day were the most important, as the final round’s top ten participants would be accepted as personal disciples by the Grand Elders.

The first day of the battle was conducted on a thousand stages simultaneously. Five participants went up on the stage at the same time, and the last one standing would enter the top one thousand.

“Now, all participants please grab your token.” After explaining the rules, Gong Fei shouted. His right hand waved, causing five thousand competition tokens to fall to the ground from above the square.

These five thousand tokens had restrictions placed on them so that no one could tell the stage number inscribed on it.

The crowd of participants leaped into the air to grab a competition token, whereas Huang Xiaolong raised his arm and a competition token fell onto his palm. Opening the restriction, inscribed on the token was the number fifty-six, indicating Huang Xiaolong’s battle stage was the fifty-sixth battle stage.

Seeing that all the participants were holding a token, Gong Fei’s hands danced in the air. One thousand battle stages rose from the ground, each of them merely twenty square meters.

Huang Xiaolong flew up, descending on battle stage number fifty-six. The other four disciples on the same battle stage descended one after another.

Huang Xiaolong observed the four disciples one by one. Lastly, his gaze fell onto a short and fat young man, a Twin Cities Sect disciple! What a coincidence.

The corner of Huang Xiaolong’s lips tilted up in a faint smile.
