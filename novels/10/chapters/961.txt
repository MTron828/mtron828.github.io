Huang Xiaolong covertly made his way back to the Spiriting Demon Gates Ancestor’s courtyard, reconvening with the Ascending Moon Old Man and Fan Yuxiao.

Because Huang Xiaolong had altered his physical appearance to that of the Ghost Refining Sect’s young lord, when he old man and Fan Yuxiao saw him, both of them panicked for a good while until Huang Xiaolong reverted to his original appearance, causing the two of them to feel frightened for nothing.

Immediately after he returned, he gave both men more than a dozen escaping talismans and communication talismans. If they felt something wasn’t right, they were to immediately flee the Ghost Refining Sect using the escaping talismans, and contact him later on using the communication talismans. At the right time, Huang Xiaolong would take them away from here.

As a precaution, he imprinted the method of leaving the Nightmare Forest into their minds. Due to an afterthought, he also gave the old man and Fan Yuxiao several bottles of rank ten tribulation grade Myriad Cure Holy Pills and a few divine armors, as well as some cautionary words before leaving, heading out of the Ghost Refining City once again.

The Ghost Refining Sect’s treasury wasn’t located inside the headquarters, but at the mountain behind the city.

In less than fifteen minutes, Huang Xiaolong stood in front of a mountain with a peak akin to the tip of a sharp blade.

The Ghost Refining Sect’s treasury was right in this place!

Moments after Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of the mountain peak, a bright light rippled in the air as four white-haired old men emerged.

They were the four guardian protectors of the treasury.

“We greet the young lord.” The four old men came up to Huang Xiaolong, greeting respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “I came over to pick something from the treasury. The four of you can withdraw, I’ll call you if there’s anything.”

“Yes, young lord.” The four guardians once again saluted and left quietly.

He then formed a strange seal with his hands and waved toward the mountain. Instantly, the blade-tip peak emitted a brilliant light, a small scale transmission array emerged at the slope of the mountain.

This transmission array was drawn using ghost talisman symbols that finally formed a big ghost face, giving off an eerie feeling.

This array was used to transfer directly into the Ghost Refining Sect’s treasury, but it required a secret method to activate it.

In a flash, Huang Xiaolong was standing at the center of the transmission array, then flicked two hand seals into the center of it.

The ghost eyes of the transmission array glimmered with a black light, causing the entire array to subsequently shake and light up. This continued for several breaths before the scenery in front of Huang Xiaolong changed. He was now standing above a big planet.

The Ghost Refining Sect’s treasures were actually kept above a big planet. Huang Xiaolong would have found it hard to believe it if he didn’t already know about it from the young lord’s memories. Even so, it was hard not to be amazed looking at the view in front of him.

Before him were various mountain ranges of piled up divine armors and weapons that extended further than the eye could see.

All of these divine armors and weapons were forged from rare ores and iron from the Divine World, every single piece was a treasure that cultivators outside could only dream of.

Moreover, there was a strong aura of divine pills coming from the unseen edge of these mountain ranges.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had obtained the Hailstone and Xuanji Treasures in the past, compared to what laid before his eyes right now, the difference was akin to that between a grass hut and a grand palace. Even ten thousand Hailstone Treasures couldn’t compare to this Ghost Refining Sect treasury in size and wealth.

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath to calm his excited heart. In a flicker, he arrived above one of the mountain peaks his palm facing downwards, then all three of his supreme godheads rotated at the same time. In the next second, the whole mountain of divine armors was sucked off the ground. This mountain was at least twenty thousand li long, and several thousand zhang tall!

He had moved the entire mountain into his spatial ring. Six breaths later, Huang Xiaolong locked onto another mountain of divine armors.

Ten minutes later, he had lost count of how many divine armor mountains he had shifted away. Even with his astonishing strength, after consecutively moving such a large amount of treasures, he was gasping for breath after ten minutes.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong could only stop and rest. He threw a rank ten tribulation grade Myriad Cure Holy Pill into his mouth and began adjusting his breathing, which caused his exhausted godforce to recover shortly.

Seeing he didn’t even make a dent in the long stretch of mountains, Huang Xiaolong actually had a wry smile on his face at this predicament. Who would thought there would be a day when he was reduced to being a porter!

‘Still, this kind of porter work doesn’t come along often, I’d better continue working hard!’

Huang Xiaolong began to move mountains of divine armors again.

At last, slightly over an hour later, Huang Xiaolong finished moving all the divine armors and stood at the beginning of the mountain high piles of weapons.

At this moment, he was extremely glad, glad that he didn’t discard the spatial rings of the Highgod Realm masters he had killed and kept them with him. Otherwise, he would be sitting on a pile of treasure with no way to take them out.

Although he had expanded the space inside his Asura Ring many times over, it still couldn’t fit so many divine armor mountains. Not to mention the mountains of weapons that were even more numerous than the divine armors. Thus, it took Huang Xiaolong two hours to move all them.

Next, Huang Xiaolong came to the divine pills section.

“Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets!”

“Undying God Pills!”

“Myriad Cure Holy Pills!”

Looking at the seemingly endless mountains of divine pellets, Huang Xiaolong swallowed audibly, every kind of divine pills found here was top grade and above! In fact, most of them were tribulation grade! With a single glance, Huang Xiaolong noticed a large number of rank nine and rank ten tribulation grade divine pellets!

Some of the divine pellets were as tall a person, with a golden cyan color or purple-silver, even emerald gold. Even with his knowledge, Huang Xiaolong actually couldn’t name some of these divine pills. Still, from the rich auras coming from them, they could be a higher grade than the Myriad Cure Holy Pill.

A hint of green flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. If he refined all of these divine pellets, he could probably break through to Ninth Order Highgod Realm, right?

‘Their grandmothers, this Ghost Refining Sect, how long have they been hoarding to accumulate so many divine pellets?!’

But now, all them were his!

Huang Xiaolong no longer dallied. His godforce roared to life again as he began to shift a mountain of Myriad Cure Holy Pills into a spatial ring.

In order to save time, he decided to forgo the lower grade Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets.

Also, Huang Xiaolong would feel slightly guilty in his heart if he really emptied out the entire Ghost Refining Sect’s treasury. No matter what, he should leave some ‘sweets’ for the kind host.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong had moved almost all of the divine pill mountains. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

While he was working hard in the treasury, the Ghost Refining Sect Master received the Infernal Ghost Messenger’s report saying the young lord had exited the Spiritual Pond Palace and was now in the treasury.

“The treasury?” The Ghost Refining Sect Master frowned, perplexed. He then gave an order to the Infernal Ghost Messenger, “Make a trip to the treasury, see what’s going on and tell the young lord to come see me.”

“Yes, Sect Master.” The Infernal Ghost Messenger acknowledged respectfully and retreated from the hall, flying toward the treasury.

A short while later, the Infernal Ghost Messenger arrived at the mountain peak.

“We greet the Ghost Messenger.” The four guardians appeared in front of him and saluted.

“All of you stay guard here, I’m going into the treasury to pick the young lord. The Sect Master wants to see him.” The Infernal Ghost Messenger said to the four guardians.
