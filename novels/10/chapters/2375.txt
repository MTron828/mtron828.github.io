Chapter 2376: Separating From Lin Xiaoying

“Life Reaping Sword Dao!” The Departing Sword Sage’s voice was as cold as his sword.

Life Reaping Sword Dao!

Everyone felt the stinging killing intent roiling around them.

Wang Yuan’s expression was ugly to the extreme, and despite feeling apprehensive of the Departing Sword Sage’s sword dao, he couldn’t lose face on the surface. “You’ve got a big tone there. It’s just a low-level trick. Wu Wo, as strong as your sword dao attainments might seem, you’re only capable of killing ants below True Saint Realm!”

Indeed, for True Saint Realm experts, once they successfully integrated with a Saint Fate, transforming his soul to holy soul, it meant that they had broken off from the shackles of the natural law of death and reincarnation. Their holy soul was indestructible. Even though the Departing Sword Sage’s sword dao was powerful, he wouldn’t be able to annihilate Wang Yuan’s holy soul unless the Departing Sword Sage could transcend True Saint Realm, stepping into Primal Ancestor Realm.

Yet the Departing Sword Sage scoffed, “Killing you is only a matter of time! Even if I can’t kill you now, I can destroy your flesh, and damage your holy soul!”

Wang Yuan’s face sank in displeasure having that pointed out.

And the Departing Sword Sage’s words gave Huang Xiaolong food for thought.

Although a True Saint’s holy soul was indestructible, his flesh was not indestructible. If a True Saint’s physical body was destroyed, and his holy soul suffered severe damage, there were only two methods to deal with the situation; the first method was to enter reincarnation and start cultivating from scratch, whereas the second method was to find a suitable physical body. The problem was, finding a suitable physical body was not easy.

This situation was similar to a saint artifact that was broken. With half of the saint artifact missing, it was difficult to find an exact part to fit it back, and to reforge it back as one entity. Some times, one might fail to meet a suitable body after searching for several hundred thousand years, even million of years.

Then again, even if one found a suitable body, he would have to spend a lot of effort to temper the flesh and bones. To temper the new body until it was as strong as how it used to be was a long and laborious process. Therefore, if a True Saint’s physical body was destroyed, and he suffered severe soul injury, the best choice was to enter reincarnation and start from zero, like what Wan Zhuoyuan did.

There was one advantage to starting from zero, and that was retaining a part of one’s True Saint Realm memories which increased one’s cultivation speed. But there was a downside as well, the holy soul only retained a small fraction of power. The holy soul’s power would recover as one’s cultivation rose.

Right at this time, Xie Bufan’s voice rang, “Retreat!”

He then exerted a powerful palm strike at Tan Juan and seized the chance to leap away, retreating with Dou Rui and the rest of the Devil Palace’s disciples.

After seeing the situation was worse for the Devil Palace’s disciples, and Huang Xiaolong had the protection of Departing Sword Sage, Xie Bufan felt that there was no hope of getting the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast. Hence he decided to withdraw.

In seconds, Xie Bufan, Dou Rui, and the rest of Devil Palace’s experts had all run away, leaving twenty or so corpses of Devil Palace’s disciples on the ground.

“We’re leaving as well.” Wang Yuan barely hesitated before instructing the Nine Plains Holy Gate experts, cupping his fists towards the Clear Snow Palace’s group then sped away.

Upon seeing this, the Holy Lands Alliance’s Yu Fujiang and those with him also bid their farewell in a haste.

The Blue Whale Race, Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, and other forces’ experts hurriedly greeted the Clear Snow Palace’s three beauties and took their leave.

When Yu Fujiang and Chen Zifeng were leaving, their gazes lingered a second longer on Lin Xiaoying.

Huang Xiaolong watched the True Reason’s Saint Fan Xia follow the Holy Lands Alliance and leave without any intention to stop. There would be time to avenge Di Huai’s family annihilation.

As for Dou Rui!

Huang Xiaolong glanced coldly in the direction Dou Rui had left. The day would come when he would devour Dou Rui’s flesh.

In a short while, all parties had left except for the Clear Snow Palace’s group.

“How dare you hide that from me, Thirteen!” Lin Xiaoying stood in front of Huang Xiaolong in a huff, and questioned angrily before Huang Xiaolong could utter a syllable.

A wry smile flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s face, knowing very well that this missy was talking about the Departing Sword Sage.

“You didn’t ask me.” Huang Xiaolong answered.

Tan Juan smiled warmly and said to Lin Xiaoying, “Alright now, Junior Sister Lin, don’t make trouble.” She then nodded her head at the Departing Sword Sage in greeting, “Brother Wu Wo, long time no see. Your sword dao has improved significantly.”

She and the Departing Sword Sage had met several times before this. Thus they could be considered as familiar with one another.

The Departing Sword Sage nodded slightly and smiled as he returned the greeting, “Miss Tan Juan.”

“Brother Wu Wo, you and Young Master Thirteen are?” Ji Xinyi jumped in with her curiosity.

Lin Xiaoying’s ears perked up hearing that, she too very much wanted to know what was the connection between Huang Xiaolong and the Departing Sword Sage.

The Departing Sword Sage glanced at Huang Xiaolong and then looked away while he stated frankly, “I will be serving Young Master Thirteen!”

“What?!” Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, Lin Xiaoying, and other Clear Snow Palace’s female experts were flabbergasted.

Serving?!

They understood very well what this serve meant.

Serving was not merely protecting like a bodyguard, but in essence, this was a master-servant relationship!

The Departing Sword Sage had actually become a Venerable’s servant!

This was the Departing Sword Sage!

He stood at the same heights as the Clear Snow Palace’s three beauties, and the Devil Palace’s six Devil Palace, yet he was serving a Seventh Order Venerable!

In the past, the Clear Snow Palace and Holy Lands Alliance had both tried to invite the Departing Sword Sage to their camps as a hired elder with huge benefits, but the Departing Sword Sage declined.

But now?!

Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, Lin Xiaoying, and others were now looking strangely at Huang Xiaolong.

They really could not understand what method Huang Xiaolong had used to get Departing Sword Sage to serve him.

Noticing these women’s strange gazes, Huang Xiaolong smiled sheepishly, “I made a bet with him, which he lost. So he’s promised to serve me.”

“A bet? Just like that?” A sense of speechlessness washed over Lin Xiaoying and everyone else. This explanation was too out of the box for them.

“That’s right,” Huang Xiaolong’s smile widened, then he cupped his fists at them as he said his farewell. Since Lin Xiaoying had found Tan Juan and the rest of her group, she was no longer in any danger. It was time to separate from them, it was after all inconvenient for him to travel with them.

He had too many secrets.

“You, you want to leave?” Hearing Huang Xiaolong say he was leaving, Lin Xiaoying could not accept it.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and said, “Since Senior Sister Lin Xiaoying has found Senior Sister Tan Juan and the others, it’s time I leave.”

He cupped his fists at Lin Xiaoying again, “I’ll visit Senior Sister Lin Xiaoying at the Clear Snow Palace. Senior Sister Lin Xiaoying, please send me out with a broom when the time comes.”

“Farewell!” Huang Xiaolong sped away on the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast, and the Departing Sword Sage followed closely behind.

Lin Xiaoying’s cherry lips parted but no sound came out. As she looked at Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure, she suddenly felt empty.

“The person has already left!” Ji Xinyi teased Xiaoying.

Lin Xiaoying curled her lips at her, with her gaze dodging, “Who is looking at that guy. If he shows up at the Clear Snow Palace in the future, I’ll send him out with a kick!”

Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and the others were struggling to keep their mouths from curving up, and making Lin Xiaoying feel embarrassed. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Let’s go!”

The Clear Snow Palace’s group also flew away from the location.

After Huang Xiaolong separated from Lin Xiaoying’s group, he did not leave the Profound River. He needed to find a few more herbs to complete the tasks he had picked up. Not to mention he planned to find more holy herbs for himself. At the same time, Huang Xiaolong wanted to try his luck and see if he could find more grandmist holy spiritual aura or something similar to the Fire and Ice Lake.

Although his divine souls had successfully transformed to holy souls, wouldn’t his holy souls continue to strengthen if he could find something similar to the Fire and Ice Lake again?!

Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that if his holy souls continued to improve, there would be a day when his holy souls transformed into dao souls of a Primal Ancestor!

If that happened, he would be able to kill True Saint experts, and devour True Saint experts’ holy souls!
