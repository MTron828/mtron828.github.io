Chapter 2966: Huang Xiaolong, How Dare You?!

Though the Sword Venerable had not created a creed, he had created the Supreme Sword Palace!

In the ranks within the Supreme, Sword Palace were numerous talented sword cultivators since the genesis era, and more than half of them had a resounding reputation in the Divine Tuo Holy World. On top of that, the Sword Venerable had accepted ten outstanding personal disciples. Each of these ten great personal disciples was rare geniuses. They were known for practicing the sword dao. One possessed the Unparalleled Sword Physique, while another was born with a divine sword in his hand, and a few of them had triggered heavenly manifestations when they were born.

These two Sword Venerable’s personal disciples weren’t as strong as Yan Bubi, but they were still mid-level Dao Venerable experts, with one at the peak late-Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable, and another at early Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, respectively.

The several Boundary Emperor Creed’s disciples that were knocked to the ground got up with furious faces. They neither offended nor collided with the other side. The Supreme Sword Palace’s disciples attacked them just because they didn’t like Boundary Emperor Creed’s disciples. More accurately, it was because the Boundary Emperor Creed was in Huang Xiaolong’s camp the Supreme Sword Palace’s disciples found them displeasing.

“His Highness Huang Xiaolong is the Son of Creation, you disrespected His Highness Huang Xiaolong and blasphemed him, you will suffer retribution for it!” One of the Boundary Creed Emperor’s disciples yelled.

“Retribution?” The Sword Venerable’s peak late-Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable disciple, Chen Lixing, snorted loudly in disdain, “Our Sword Venerable has allied with the Poison Valley and World Tree, moreover, the Stonemen Race, Inferno Race, Darkness Demon Creed, and Devouring Sun Creed have all joined our alliance. At this point, even the Dragon Fish Creed’s ten creeds’ alliance cannot overpower us, what can Huang Xiaolong do to us?!”

The Supreme Sword Palace was built by the Sword Venerable, the Poison Valley was the force formed by the Poison Bodach, and World Tree was a force belonging to the Nine-headed Tree Demon. Both Stonemen Race and Inferno Race were genesis races that ranked quite high amongst the rest of the genesis races, second only to the Holy Dragon Race and Heavenly Phoenix Race. The Darkness Demon Creed and Devouring Sun Creed were top-tier creeds just like the Dragon Fish Creed and Divination Creed.

The Sword Venerable’s other disciple, the early Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, Kong Ling, grinned menacingly. “In the future, more top-tier creeds, genesis races, and hidden families would join our alliance, so what if Huang Xiaolong has twelve high-order Saint Fates and that he’s the Son of Creation? It would be better if he surfaces, we’re quite troubled having to search for him!”

Right at this time, an icy cold voice sounded, “Is that so?”

No one could pinpoint which direction the ethereal cold voice came from, but anyone could detect the strong killing intent within.

Chen Lixing and Kong Ling were startled for a split second, they looked around and saw a wide berth open through the crowd, and at the end of it stood a young man approaching with his hands clasped behind him, long hair fluttering without any wind blowing. The young man’s stride was unhurried yet the young man reached them in a single step.

Just as the two of them were inwardly guessing who Huang Xiaolong might be, the crowd around them stirred.

Their ears repeatedly captured three words-Huang Xiaolong. Chen Lixing and Kong Ling were stunned, Huang Xiaolong?

Kong Ling’s eyes narrowed as he observed Huang Xiaolong from head to toe like a curious cat, “So, you’re Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong, it’s a surprise that you still dare to come to Dragon Fish City!”

Huang Xiaolong responded without any expression, “In the entire Huang Long World, there’s not a place I can’t go.”

Chen Lixing and Kong Ling exchanged a glance, then erupted in roaring laughter.

“Huang Xiaolong, we know that you’re the Son of Creation, however, this identity of yours is useless in front of us,” Kong Ling sneered, “Do you think because this is place is within the Dragon Fish Heavenly Creed, and you have the protection of Dragon Fish Creed, we won’t dare to do anything to you? You’d better hand out the Tree of Beginning before suffering!”

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent, “If I refuse?”

“Refuse?” Chen Lixing chuckled maliciously, “We might not be your opponents, but our Senior Brother Yan Bubi is also in the city, he’s a mid-Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable expert that has inherited our master’s invincible sword dao. He could abuse half to death before Bi Cheng and the others arrive to save you!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Therefore, you better hand it out now!” Chen Lixing chuckled, “Moreover, apart from our Supreme Sword Palace, the Poison Valley, and World Tree’s experts are also in the Dragon Fish City, a few of them are early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts, you won’t be able to run if they want to snatch the Tree of Beginning!”

Huang Xiaolong did not speak, instead, he took a glance at the several Boundary Emperor Creed’s disciples.

In the short time Huang Xiaolong exchanged sentences with the other side, these Boundary Emperor Creed’s disciples endured the pain in their bodies and knelt towards Huang Xiaolong in salute.

Seeing this, Chen Lixing laughed even louder, “Huang Xiaolong, you want to save these few Boundary Emperor Creed’s disciples? You can’t even save yourself, so you better think how you’re going to escape later.”

“Pity you didn’t see me in action when I was slaughtering through those Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciples. Oh, they were screaming so miserably, so tragic, and before their death, they were still hoping you would come to save them. Well, pity you didn’t come, we didn’t even see a strand of your hair.” Chen Lixing guffawed.

Kong Ling was laughing too loudly.

Other experts that were gloating inwardly also laughed out loud.

Looking at the laughing Chen Lixing, Huang Xiaolong punched out with the force of shattering the earth. Chen Lixing’s laughter came to an abrupt stop the moment his head exploded into pieces, intelligible pieces of flesh and bones, and golden blood splattered from high air.

The world fell into silence.

All shocked widened eyes were staring at the headless Chen Lixing!

Earlier, Huang Xiaolong used the power of absolute blaze to devour the Royal Peacock Creed’s Guo Borong bit by bit, many in the crowd had witnessed that. However, Guo Borong was merely a mid-Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable, whereas Chen Lixing was a peak late-Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable expert ah!

Yet his head exploded from one punch!

This!

Everyone was flabbergasted.

Kong Ling’s face turned deathly pale in an instant and dared not make any abrupt movement for the time being. He was genuinely frightened. Although it was long-rumored that Huang Xiaolong’s battle prowess was amazing, he did not believe it for one second. In his opinion, Huang Xiaolong was merely a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable, how strong could he be?

But now, that one punch!

“You!” Kong Ling finally managed to spit out one word with quivering lips.

“Don’t worry, I won’t burst you with one punch, I will slowly crush you bit by bit, from your inextinguishable dao heart, your dao veins, and your head, crush them one by one!”

Huang Xiaolong was cold and indifferent, and at this time, Chen Lixing’s dao soul was going to make a run for it. The suction force from Huang Xiaolong’s palm pulled it back, then he wrapped Chen Lixing’s dao soul in a layer of absolute blaze, just like how he had burned Liu Xinxin’s dao soul in the past, he was burning Chen Lixing’s dao soul.

Chen Lixing’s dao soul wailed tragically.

Kong Ling ashen, but put up a brave front, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you!”

“How dare I?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Just see if I dare?!” With that said, his palm reached across space and grabbed onto Kong Ling, and dragged Kong Ling up to himself.

To Kong Ling’s horror, he, an early Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, was powerless to resist Huang Xiaolong.

A sudden heart-piercing pain came from his right arm, Huang Xiaolong had crushed his arm into pieces, scaring the daylights out of the spectating experts. Kong Ling was an early Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable expert, how strong was his dao physique? Yet it was crushed under Huang Xiaolong’s fingers like toasted bread!

While Huang Xiaolong was crushing parts of Kong Ling’s body, Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and the others who had been discussing merely finally got news of Huang Xiaolong’s emergence in the Dragon Fish City.

“Huang Xiaolong, you sure got a lot of guts to destroy my junior brother’s dao physique!” Yan Bubi furiously jumped to his feet, exuding an overwhelming killing intent from head to toe, “Even if Bi Cheng old man comes, he can’t save you!”

He turned into a streak of metallic sword light that shot out of the mansion, disappearing from others’ sight.

Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and the others followed up quickly. There was the Tree of Beginning on Huang Xiaolong, naturally, they can’t allow others to snatch it away for nothing.
