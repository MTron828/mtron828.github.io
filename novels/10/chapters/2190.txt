Chapter 2191: Is Huang Xiaolong Dead?

When Jian Qintian and the others were finally gone, the unstoppable lightning barrage descended on Huang Xiaolong and his party. A flash of lightning appeared from the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows as a majestic lightning pool emerged.

The lightning pool was currently in the process of fusion as all nine great lightning pools combined to form a single entity. The massive lightning spirit stood tall in the space above the lightning pool as blinding rays of light surrounded its body.

The lightning barrage that was raging across the lands finally arrived and swallowed Huang Xiaolong and the others. Unable to contain the sense of fright in their hearts, everyone closed their eyes.

Even the ever-confident Huang Xiaolong felt his scalp tingle as his heart started to pound.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. The lightning spirit summoned a colossal world of lightning that protected them from the frightening bolts of lightning.

No matter how strong and destructive the lightning barrage was, it failed to enter the world of lightning.

The Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler slowly opened their eyes. When they saw that they were protected from the raging bolts of lightning, they couldn’t help but wipe the cold sweat that was about to drip off their foreheads.

According to them, they had barely escaped the jaws of death.

The lightning barrage didn’t stop after sweeping past Huang Xiaolong and the others. It filled the space outside the 33 heavens, and Jian Qintian and the others had nowhere to go other than back to the 33 heavens.

Even though the lightning barrage failed to destroy the world of lightning protecting Huang Xiaolong and the rest, they were able to clearly see the situation around them. Bolts of lightning danced in the space around them, and everyone felt immense pressure crushing down on them. It was a weird but miraculous sight, burning itself into their minds for eternity.

Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong realized that the lightning spirit was sucking in shocking amounts of lightning spiritual qi from the lightning barrage as it refined it without end!

With the never-ending stream of lightning spiritual qi, the lightning spirit’s transformation started to speed up. Even though Huang Xiaolong had no idea how quickly it was transforming, he knew that it was definitely going faster than before.

A trace of surprise flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

In the past, Huang Xiaolong had estimated that it would take an extremely long time for the fusion process to complete. But now that it was absorbing the lightning spiritual qi from the space outside the 33 heavens, the transformation would complete in less than thirty years!

It was definitely an unexpected surprise for him!

Huang Xiaolong turned his gaze to the Lightning Origin Divine Tree.

As it emitted burst upon burst of lightning qi, it defended itself against the lightning barrage. Like the lightning spirit, it was also sucking in the lightning spiritual qi contained in the lightning barrage.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head silently. It definitely deserved its name as the number one divine tree in the myriad of worlds. It was able to withstand the destructive might of the lightning barrage! Moreover, it could absorb the lightning qi to strengthen itself!

Heaving a sigh of relief, Huang Xiaolong made his way to the Lightning Origin Divine Tree. It was time for him to harvest both the tree and its fruits.

When Huang Xiaolong moved towards the tree, Jian Qintian and the others had finally escaped a trillion miles away from the storm.

“It seems like Huang Xiaolong and the others failed to escape!” One of the elders of the Sword Race said, “He should still be trying to obtain the Lightning Origin Divine Tree... If he stayed, he should have been swallowed by the lightning barrage!”

A smile broke out on Jian Xiaofu’s face when she heard the news. “Is it true?!”

“He should be swallowed up by the lightning barrage...” Another elder continued, “They were definitely swallowed by the lightning barrage.”

The smile on Jian Xiaofu’s face started to spread as she broke out into laughter, “The lightning barrage isn’t formed by ordinary divine lightning! Even late-Tenth Order Sovereigns wouldn’t be able to escape from it! Someone like the leader of the 33 Heavens Race might not be able to survive if he was trapped in it! It seems like Huang Xiaolong and the others are really dead!”

It’s great that that hateful b*stard is dead!

A trace of delight rose in her heart.

She really hated Huang Xiaolong. In fact, she was happy that he was dead!

Jian Qintian felt a weight lifted off his chest. He knew the horrors of the lightning barrage. The chances of Huang Xiaolong living through it was definitely zero!

Never in his life had he heard of anyone surviving the lightning barrage!

“What a shame...” Jian Qintian hesitated before continuing, “What a shame we failed to obtain the Lightning Origin Divine Fruits!”

“The battle between the Giant Kun Ruler and Yang Tianchen was so intense! If not for that b*stard’s appearance, they would have fought each other with everything they had! At the right time, all we would have needed to do was to swoop in and grab the fruits! That f*cking b*stard! He wasted all our efforts!”

The Giant Kun Ruler and Yang Tianchen quickly received the news of Huang Xiaolong’s ‘death.’ According to the reports, Huang Xiaolong was unwilling to leave the Lightning Origin Divine Tree and was swallowed by the lightning barrage.

As soon as they listened to the reports. Brilliant smiles appeared on their faces.

“Great! It’s good that he’s dead!” The Giant Kun Ruler roared with laughter.

Initially, he was sure that he wouldn’t be able to return to his heavenly country even if he left the space outside the 33 heavens. He was planning to look for a nice location to hide in case Huang Xiaolong sought him out. Who would have thought that Huang Xiaolong would die in the space outside the 33 heavens?

“Even though that b*stard, Huang Xiaolong, is dead, we can’t let him off so easily!” A sinister smile appeared on Giant Kun Heavenly Ruler’s face. “When I get back, the guards and soldiers of the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country will have to die! Capture Huang Xiaolong’s master, the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the others! We’ll torture them with all the methods available to us!”

Yang Tianchen grinned. “Of course! Huang Xiaolong killed too many experts of my 33 Heavens Race! Exterminating the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country won’t be enough to lessen my hatred for him!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The two of them stared at the lightning barrage raging behind them and they quickly fled from the space outside the 33 heavens. They only relaxed after returning to the Heavens Path.

Half a month later, Yang Tianchen and the ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country glared at the Heavenly Saint Country before them. In just half a month, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s achievements and battle prowess spread through the Heavens Path. The battle where the experts of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, 33 Heavens Race, and Heavenly Terror Country had surrounded Huang Xiaolong was raging across the Heavens Path!

The stories became more and more exaggerated and the reputations of the three factions were dragged through the mud.

There were even some people saying stuff like this, “The ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country and Yang Tianchen screamed like a pig in a slaughterhouse when fighting against Huang Xiaolong! They were bullied to the point they were crying for their parents!”

“The Giant Kun Heavenly Country, the 33 Heavens Race, and the Heavenly Terror Country sent out more than a hundred experts, but not a single one of them managed to escape! They were more useless than the trash along the streets! Number one superpower in the Heavens Path? More like number one trash!”

These sorts of discussions could be heard all around the Heavens Path.

The reputation of Giant Kun Heavenly Ruler reached rock bottom.

The prestige of the 33 Heavens Race also took a huge hit.

Listening to all the discussions going around, Giant Kun Heavenly Ruler placed all the blame onto Huang Xiaolong’s head!

“Kill them all!” A roar resounded through the heavens as the ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country lost the last of his patience. In a flash, the experts of the 33 Heavens Race and the Giant Kun Heavenly Country entered the Heavenly Saint Country.

It was too bad they failed to locate anyone. The expression on Giant Kun Heavenly Ruler’s face sank. The King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, the King of Darkness, and various experts and generals of the Heavenly Saint Country had already fled.

Staring at the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace, the ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country smashed it with a single punch before raging, “Pass down my order! Find them even if you have to flip the Heavens Path over!”
