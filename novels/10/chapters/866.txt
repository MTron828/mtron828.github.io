After those Yelu Family disciples were done with relaying the message to Yelu Tianfeng and other family disciples, they noticed that someone was there with them.

“Huang Xiaolong!” The Yelu Family group leader blurted out when he saw the person’s face. He was surprised, excited, then his face went grim, “We searched high and low for you, who would have thought we’d find you here. Huang Xiaolong ah, Huang Xiaolong, you ignore the path to Heaven and come running toward the Gates of Hell, let’s see how you’re going to escape this time.”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong retorted, direct and indifferent.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s indifference, the Yelu Family group leader sneered, “You’re probably still ignorant. Our Big brother Yelu Tianfeng and Big brother Yelu Wei will arrive here very soon, together with the others!”

A snicker sounded from Huang Xiaolong’s mouth at that Yelu Family disciple’s intimidation. This suited him just fine, he could deal with them all at once, saving him the trouble of searching for them everywhere.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong could afford to wait. He stood there with his hands clasped behind him, waiting for Yelu Tianfeng and the other Yelu Family disciples to arrive.

The present Yelu Family disciples secretly breathed in relief when they saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to run.

The ten of them were aware of Huang Xiaolong’s strength that was comparable to a peak mid-Third Order Highgod Realm master. Had he chose to run, not a single one of them would have been able to delay him. However, the group leader’s sneer became even deeper; since this Huang Xiaolong was so blatantly waiting for death, they would fulfill his wish in a little bit!

About ten minutes later.

Sounds of piercing wind came from the distance as a group of Yelu Family disciples flew toward the square at high speed.

When the disciples on the square saw this group, obvious elation was displayed on their faces.

The leader of this group was none other than the person close to stepping into peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm, Yelu Wei.

Yelu Wei descended gracefully on the square. His sharp gaze made a quick sweep around the square and saw Huang Xiaolong standing there, calm and indifferent, with his hands behind his back. Yelu Wei was stunned.

The first batch of Yely Family disciples that arrived hurried forward to greet Yelu Wei, and their group leader immediately protested, “Big brother Yelu Wei, this Huang Xiaolong is really too arrogant, not putting our family in his eyes. Should we teach him a lesson right now?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A frown wrinkled Yelu Wei’s forehead, answering in a solemn voice, “There’s no hurry, we’ll decide after Big brother Yelu Tianfeng arrives.”

The leader of the first group was surprised by Yelu Wei’s answer, but he did not object. Throwing a piercing look at Huang Xiaolong, he said, “Then we’ll let this punk live for a few more minutes.”

Soon, another group arrived at the square, their leader none other than Yelu Tianfeng himself. However, he was joined by a number of Beitang Family disciples.

There was a stalwart Beitang Family disciple who flew beside Yelu Tianfeng, the aura coming from his body not losing out in the least to Yelu Tianfeng’s. This person was none other than the Beitang Family’s most distinguished and greatest genius of the last ten million years, who had reached peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm in a little over one thousand and seven hundred years. He was Beitang Wuji.

Currently, Beitang Wuji’s ranking was slightly below Yelu Tianfeng’s, at the 16th place.

“Big brother Tianfeng!” Yelu Wei and the rest of Yelu Family disciples were excited when they saw him arrive.

Yelu Tianfeng nodded slightly at them before turning to look at Huang Xiaolong.

“Mid Second Order Highgod Realm?” Standing beside Yelu Tianfeng, Beitang Wuji saw through Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation in a single glance, laughing in disdain, “Yelu Tianfeng, this kind of small shrimp needs you to take care of it personally?”

He did not pay attention to Beitang Wuji’s ridicule, walking up to Huang Xiaolong. Yelu Tianfeng’s momentum was rising with every step and his long spear appeared in his hand, his gaze chilling cold, “Mid-Second Order Highgod Realm, this is your true strength, right? No wonder Yelu Xin, Yely Bi, and Yelu Xuan all died in your hand. But, there’s something else I’m curious about, you actually aren’t trying to run. Since you didn’t try to run, is it because you know you won’t be able to escape, and hence, the better option is to wait for me here and hope you’ll be lucky enough to win against me?”

The tip of Yelu Tianfeng’s long spear was pointed at Huang Xiaolong’s face, but just as he was about to send Huang Xiaolong on his way, Yelu Wei interjected, “Big brother Yelu, maybe I should start first?”

Yelu Tianfeng pondered for a moment before agreeing, “Alright, but don’t kill him yet, I still want to break every bone in his body and skin him alive.”

Yelu Wei reassured him, “Don’t worry, Big brother Tianfeng.” He then approached Huang Xiaolong with a longsword in his hand.

Hearing this conversation between the two, Huang Xiaolong shook his head, a faint smile on his lips, “No need to make it so troublesome, both of you can attack together, or all your Yelu Family disciples can attack together, that would save me the trouble of going after you lot one by one.”

Huang Xiaolong’s words enraged all present Yelu Family disciples.

“Punk, you’re seeking death!”

“I alone am enough to kill this punk!” An early Third Order Highgod Realm disciple shouted in anger.

Yelu Wei’s longsword suddenly resonated, emitting a clear vibrating hum, a whelming rush of godforce swirled around him.

“Ten Thousand Snakes Sword Formation!”

Yelu Wei thrust his sword at Huang Xiaolong.

The surrounding disciples immediately saw sword lights flying out, vibrating as they whistled in the air, resembling pounding snakes. Those sword snakes actually formed a sword formation. Sword lights sliced all lightning force between the two, arriving in front of Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong did not give more than a glance to Yelu Wei’s attack. He merely gave a casual flick of his hand, akin to brushing off an annoying fly. Before the spectating Yelu and Beitang Families’ disciples, that snake-sword formation that could seemingly slice everything in its path suddenly burst apart, as if it a giant hand slammed down on it.

Whereas Yelu Wei, the shockwave from the impact sent him reeling backwards all the way to the edge of the square before managing to forcefully steady himself.

Rounded shocked eyes were many watching what just happened.

Yelu Wei, who was infinitely close to advancing to peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm lost!

One move!

Even Beitang Wuji was shocked.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over Yelu Tianfeng and the Yelu Family disciples, his voice indifferently cold, “I’ve already said, the lot of you should attack together, it’ll save me the trouble of going through you one by one.”

Yelu Tianfeng’s expression was extremely grim, but he took a deep breath and calmed himself. He then pointed at Huang Xiaolong once again with the long spear in his hand, cold and merciless, “I admit you have the strength to be my opponent, however, I alone am more than enough to kill you! Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you die under my spear skill!”

“I will use my most powerful attack that even a common early Fourth Order Highgod Realm wouldn’t be able to withstand. Hopefully, you can.”

Yelu Tianfeng bellowed, his voice shaking the air like thunder as he lunged forward, akin to a submerged dragon flying out from the bottom of the sea. The long spear in his hand howled at Huang Xiaolong.

“Killing God, Extermination of Ten Thousand Gods!”

In the blink of an eye, Yelu Tianfeng’s spear had stabbed out ten thousand times!

Not one more, not one less!

Every stab of his spear condensed a terrifying spear qi that filled the surroundings, seemingly able to destroy all that stood in its way.

This was the metal element godforce that Yelu Tianfeng imbued into his spear.

The metal element godforce had the highest attack power compared to water, fire, earth, and wood amongst the five elements. Moreover, Yelu Tianfeng’s spear technique was a powerful ancient technique.

The instant Yelu Tianfeng attacked, the airspace above the square was riddled with small space black holes!

Yelu Tianfeng’s attack was ten times more powerful than Yelu Wei’s.

The ‘Killing God, Extermination of Ten Thousand Gods’ technique was too fast, so fast that Huang Xiaolong seemed unable to block it in time. Ten thousand stabs all landed on his body.

Seeing this, Yelu Tianfeng was inwardly relieved. The surrounding Yelu Family disciples were all cheering out loud with beaming smiles.
