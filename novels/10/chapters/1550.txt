Jiang Hong raised his hand. This time, he did not attack with merely a finger as he did when dealing with the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Emperor Mo Xiao. Instead, he waved once in the air like he was waving away an annoying fly.

There were no energy fluctuations nor noises.

Jiang Hong’s action did not attract Lei Budong, Shui Luosheng, Guang Wenfang, Feng Chen or Huo Haibo’s attention.

Standing among the Barbarians’ small chieftains, venomous excitement sparked in Feng Shili’s eyes as he watched Feng Chen and Huo Haibo attacking Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel.

The Barbarians watched with anticipation as Feng Chen and Huo Haibo’s palms struck towards Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel. In the next moment, the awe-inspiring Feng Chen and Huo Haibo flew out as if they were hit by a great impact. Their robes exploded into fragments in mid air and their bodies smashed into the mountain peaks in the distance.

Echoes of thunderous booms shook the air.

Rocks and gravel flew out in various directions.

The abrupt change in situation dumbfounded the Barbarians.

Lei Budong, Shui Luosheng, Guang Wenfang and the others stared at Feng Chen and Huo Haibo who were half buried in dirt.

This!

What actually happened just now?!

Lei Budong, Shui Luosheng, and Guang Wenfang were filled with disbelief. Until now, they still had not figured out what had happened.

But the dumbfounded Barbarians soon reacted. Some of the experts hastened to Feng Chen and Huo Haibo’s sides, and helped them out from the ground and began healing their injuries.

Jiang Hong had not intended to kill Feng Chen and Huo Haibo, so both regained their consciousness after some rescue efforts.

Awakened, Feng Chen and Huo Haibo ignored the various strange expressions on the experts’ faces around them, instead, both were looking at Jiang Hong with horror.

Lei Budong, Shui Luosheng, and Guang Wenfang were still unaware it was Jiang Hong who had attacked Feng Chen and Huo Haibo, but they did realize that whoever had attacked from Huang Xiaolong’s group was a high-level Emperor Realm master!

No, maybe a Tenth Order Emperor Realm master!!

“You, who are you?!” Feng Chen asked feebly while being helped up from the ground. His voice quivered slightly from dread.

This time, Lei Budong, Shui Luosheng, Guang Wenfang, and other Barbarians took another look at Jiang Hong with shock and apprehension. It would be stupid if they still couldn’t guess it was Jiang Hong who had attacked just now.

Jiang Hong did not answer them but casually raised his hand and waved. A storm of golden purple lights shot out. Lei Budong, Shui Luosheng, Guang Wenfang, Feng Chen, and the others had yet to distinguish what the golden purple shiny things were, but these golden purple things entered their bodies.

In the next second, Lei Budong, Shui Luosheng, and all the Barbarians’ experts discovered that their godforce was completely restrained, so was their physical body’s strength!

Even though they could still move and talk, they had completely lost any power to resist!

What ability was this? Or some kind of ancient prohibition restriction formation that could be thrown out with a wave of the hand? It was so powerful that it could have restrained five Emperor Realm masters and hundreds of Heavenly Monarch Realm masters simultaneously?

They had never heard of something like this before!

“You, what do you want to do?’ Lei Budong had lost the arrogant confidence on his face as he stuttered, “You, you want to kill us all?!”

Hearts tightened nervously as they looked at Jiang Hong with great wariness.

Jiang Hong sighed and said, “I have merely suppressed your strengths temporarily. The restraints inside your bodies will resolve by themselves in a couple of decades.”

Of course, before that time came, Lei Budong’s group was no different from ordinary people...

Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the others relaxed when Jiang Hong stated that he would spare them but the latter part of the problem sent them into a reel of panic.

Huang Xiaolong interjected at this point, “You tribe have a rule passed down from your ancestors that anyone, regardless of who they are, as long as they could take the Barbarians out of this place will make that person your tribe’s king, right?”

The five Head Chieftains exchanged a perplexed glance among themselves after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s unexpected question.

“You, you mean, you have a way to leave this space? You can cross the Land of Lightning Penalty?” Lei Budong asked several questions in shock.

“Yes, I do have a way.” The little cow smugly replied.

Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the others’ gaze fell on Jiang Hong consecutively. In their opinions, if Huang Xiaolong’s group really had a way out, it would naturally rely on the most powerful person—Jiang Hong.

But the little cow pointed at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Accurately speaking, he has a way out of here.”

What?!

Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the others were astounded as they stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

How is that possible? A mere God King Realm brat has a way to take them out of this space?

“Him? Impossible!” Huo Haibo was the first to jump out. He looked at Huang Xiaolong in contempt and scolded, “For how many millions of years our tribe has tried to cross the Land of Lightning Penalty? Even the generations of Tenth Order Emperor Realm ancestors could not find a way. He’s just a God King Realm snot-nosed punk, how could he have any method to cross the Land of Lightning Penalty?”

Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the rest too had a look of disbelief on their faces. They even thought that the little cow was playing a joke on them for her pleasure.

“Believe it or not, it’s up to you.” Huang Xiaolong said indifferently and ignored Lei Budong’s group. He left the Chaos Black Camel to keep an eye on them, then sped into the purple peak with Jiang Hong, Xiang Xun, and the rest of his group.

With their entire body’s strength and godforce restrained, the Barbarians watched powerlessly as Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the Dragon Rain Sacred Peak.

Not to mention, they did not dare to make any move with the Chaos Black Camel watching them from the side.

“Could that kid really have a way to get out of here?!” Shui Luosheng watched Huang Xiaolong’s back with heavy disbelief in his voice.

“Unless!” A possibility flashed in Lei Budong’s mind.

Seeing the sudden change on Lei Budong’s face, Feng Chen, Huo Haibo, Shui Luosheng, and Guang Wenfang seemed to understand Lei Budong’s thoughts.

“Elder Brother Budong, are you saying that he has one of the nine chaos lightning pools?!” Guang Wenfang’s chest tightened with excitement as she voiced the question in everyone’s mind. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Feng Chen and the other three Head Chieftains’ breathing quickened.

The nine chaos lightning pools!

Lei Budong tried his best to suppress the bubbling excitement in his heart as he said, “It is possible! If he really has the nine chaos lightning pools, it is highly possible he could help our tribe to exit this place!”

Imagining that the Barbarians would be able to walk out of this space to see the real world outside, Lei Budong could hardly contain the joy in his heart.

The Barbarians had been confined to this space for too long, too long. Every generation of their tribe’s experts had longed for the outside world. They had prayed that they would get to walk out of this space one day and take a breath of the outside air as well as look at the wonderful sceneries!

“According to our ancestor’s rule, if there is someone who could take our tribe out of this place, he will be our tribe’s king, but he’s merely a God King Realm brat...?” Huo Haibo refuted weakly.

“If he really could take our tribe out from this space, so what if he becomes our tribe’s king?” Lei Budong’s eyes shone as he went on, “Not to mention, if he really has one the nine chaos lightning pools, he would definitely become a peerless master in the future. Didn’t you see it for yourself that even though he is a God King Realm, he has two Emperor Realm pet mounts? Also, don’t forget, that middle-aged man is his Senior Brother! How could that kid’s identity be simple!”

Recalling Jiang Hong’s strength, there was dread on Lei Budong, Feng Chen, Huo Haibo, Guang Wenfang, and the others’ faces.

“That kid’s Senior Brother is probably a Tenth Order Emperor Realm master?” Feng Chen said with much difficulty.

Lei Budong shook his head. “I don’t know, maybe he’s a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm master, even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm master!”
