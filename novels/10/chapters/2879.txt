Chapter 2880: Appeared!

The female disciple went out and saw a stalwart young man with extraordinary bearing waiting outside in the yard, and the Dragon Sword hung from his waist.

As he saw the female disciple come out, the young man’s eyes lit up, and he took a few hurried steps forward, “Junior Sister Li Nan, is Young Lady Yin Yue willing to…?”

The female disciple shook her head, looking a little embarrassed. “Young Lord Yong Luosheng, my young lady doesn’t want to see anyone during this period. I hope Young Lord Yong Luosheng won’t mind.”

The young man was none other than the Ten Swords Creed’s leader, the Dragon Sword’s chosen person, Yong Luosheng.

The smile on Yong Luosheng’s face stiffened when he heard the reply, but he still forcefully maintained his smile, “It’s alright. In that case, I will pay Young Lady Yin Yue a visit another day!”

The female disciple Li Nan nodded and uttered another word of apology before turning around and returning inside.

Yong Luosheng watched Li Nan as she returned, and the amiable smile on his face gradually vanished into a thin line.

“Eldest Senior Brother, isn’t Young Lady Yin Yue putting herself on a pedestal too high? Even though Eldest Senior Brother came to see her from far away, she couldn’t even be bothered to spare some time to see Eldest Senior Brother. She didn’t even let Eldest Senior Brother enter the courtyard.” A Ten Swords Creed’s disciple behind Yong Luosheng fumed.

Although the three moons were famous and belonged to the younger generation of outstanding talent, however, Yong Luosheng was the leader of the ten swords, was stopped at the door. They didn’t even get a cup of tea. This made the Ten Swords Creed’s disciples seethe with anger.

“Let’s go!” Yong Luosheng’s face sank as he turned around to leave decisively.

The disciples quickly followed after him.

“Senior Brother, I’ve heard rumors that Young Lady Yin Yue is here specifically to look for that young man,” another disciple mentioned.

Yong Luosheng’s face turned gloomier upon hearing that.

That young man was the sinner, who had defeated his Junior Brother Zhou Hong and destroyed Junior Brother Chen Dingtian’s dao physique!

He had already put out the word that he was going to kill that young man personally!

But now, the person of his heart had traveled millions of miles to the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave to search for that young man and just to see that young man!

Yong Luosheng’s killing intent roiled violently at this thought.

“Young Lady Yin Yue is not the only one, but Young Lady Yu Yue and Feng Yue have also been at the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave for more than a decade. It is said that both of them are waiting to see that young man,” another disciple chimed in a jealous tone. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The three moons were the Divine Tuo Holy World’s three most beautiful women, and they had been prolonging their stay at the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, waiting for the same man!

Anyone would be jealous and madly envious of this.

These were the three moons! Not to mention just their beauty, but each of them was also highly talented. Each one of them had ten high-order Saint Fates, and they were personal disciples of their respective creed’s patriarchs. It also meant that they held the position of young patriarch in their respective creeds.

Marrying any one of these women would make everyone in the Divine Tuo Holy World envy them to death.

Before, no one man had garnered this level of attention from the three moons.

And now, the three moons had stayed for more than a decade in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave for a man!

As expected, when Yong Luosheng heard what the disciple said, his killing intent almost ran amok.

“I, Yong Luosheng, vow that if I don’t cut that punk into a million pieces, I am not a man!” Yong Luosheng gnashed through every word with hatred.

“Then, Eldest Senior Brother, where are we going now?” one of the disciples asked. “Should weo search for that punk? Then again, that punk can really hide well as no one has been able to find him even after so long. It won’t be easy to dig him out in the vast Divine Tuo Holy World.”

A brutal cold light gleamed in Yong Luosheng’s eyes as an idea came to him. “We’re going to the Monarch Yu Sacred Land’s Dragon Emperor Continent!”

“Dragon Emperor Continent?” No one reacted for a moment.

Yong Luosheng elaborated simply, “Long Jianfei is a member of Long Family. Therefore, that punk and Long Jianfei will surely return to the Dragon Emperor Continent’s Long Family. We just need to wait for the prey there!”

“My gut tells me that the punk is still here in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, and as long as that kid dares to return to the Long Family with Long Jianfei—!” Killing intent threatened to spill out from Yong Luosheng’s eyes as he continued, “I’ll make sure he dies under my Dragon Sword, to avene Junior Brother Zhou Hong and Junior Brother Chen Dingtian!”

With a goal in mind, Yong Luosheng led the group of Ten Swords Creed’s disciples and set off to the Monarch Yu Sacred Land.

The reason why Yong Luosheng was so certain that Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei would still return to the Long Family was because the result of his investigation had showed that Huang Xiaolong had hidden the Long Family somewhere in the Dragon Emperor Continent. Hence, Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei would definitely return to the Dragon Emperor Continent.

……

Deep in the Blue Lotus Creed’s void, where boundless turbulent chaos energy surged, the void around the Qilin Chariot suddenly emitted a blinding light, spreading outwards rapidly.

If a Dao Venerable Realm expert were to see this sight, he would be able to see an amazing energy gushing out around the Qilin Chariot. This energy actually pushed out the surrounding chaotic turbulence.

And under the Qilin Chariot’s formation space, a dark green light flowed out ofHuang Xiaolong’s body. There was also an icy blue light, a blazing crimson light, and an ink-black light.

A giant golden dragon hovered behind Huang Xiaolong, exuding the boundless might of the Huang Long Dragon.

In the past, the Huang Long Dragon was merely a vague shadow, but now, as Huang Xiaolong’s strength rose over the years, and advanced through the cultivation realms, it was no different than an actual dragon.

A ten thousand zhang giant golden dragon hovered behind Huang Xiaolong, covering the sky as it overlooked the world below. Those enormous dragon eyes glimmered with the mysterious gleam of profound grand dao laws, as if the eyes were two small worlds.

Terrifying Primal Ancestor’s might filled the entire space.

Half a day later.

The multi-colored lights around Huang Xiaolong dissipated as he slowly opened his eyes.

Feeling the seemingly inexhaustible energy running through his body, Huang Xiaolong exhaled a long breath, and the space rumbled as he exhaled.

This time around, he had been in seclusion for forty years, and he had refined all blue lotuses that were three-seeded and above.

He advanced to the Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm six years ago, and now, he was already a peak mid-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

“Unfortunately, still lacking a bit.” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. Just a bit more and he could have entered the late-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm.

Looking at the remaining four blue lotuses for a good while, he finally decided against refining them. Although his cultivation would improve a bit by refining these four blue lotuses, he wouldn’t necessarily enter the late-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. In that case, it would be better to keep them to be auctioned in exchange for some Tuoshen dao coins, grand dao pills, or dao spiritual veins.

Huang Xiaolong stood up.

What’s the latest situation outside?

Although he had been cultivating in seclusion all this time in the Qilin Chariot, he could imagined the situation outside more or less.

The Ten Swords Creed has probably issued a kill bounty for his head, right? The Dragon Fish Creed might have issued the same order.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned cold as he thought of it.

At this time, Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng were flying over from the distance.

“Congratulations Your Highness!” The three stood in front of Huang Xiaolong, bowing respectfully as they congratulated him.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and smiled at the three of them, telling them to rise.

Half an hour later, a grand chariot appeared above the Blue Lotus Creed. When the Qilin Chariot appeared, some experts noticed it immediately, and the word spread from one to two, to a hundred, and in less than a day’s time, the entire Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave knew about it.

“What?! That young man has appeared! He really did not flee out of the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave?!”

“He might not be able to flee even if he wanted to! After hiding for several decades, he finally couldn’t hide anymore!”
