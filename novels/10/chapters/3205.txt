Chapter 3206: Working With The Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire

Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls locked onto the other party.

Too fast!

Even Huang Xiaolong was shocked by their speed.

The other party had to be someone who also reached perfection level in twelve elements!

If he didn’t use the Huang Long Cape, his speed should be comparable to the other party!

Soon, the other party somewhere above them.

If their entry to the sea of flames was coincidental, their current location gave it away. They had a way of locating Zeng Ying’s party, and they should also know about the Mysterious Magician’s Treasury!

Was there a traitor?!

That was the first thought in Huang XIaolong’s mind.

When Huang Xiaolong was still thinking of the possibility, the other party remained above them without moving in the slightest.

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips when he noticed what they were doing. The other party was definitely waiting for Zeng Ying and the others to break the Five Directions Grand Formation before swooping down for the kill. They would be able to obtain an easy victory against someone who spent all their energy shattering the formation.

“Purple Lightning Young Master, where are they now?” Chen Zhenghong, one of the experts protecting Zeng Ying, asked.

He was one of the four super experts she brought along with her, and he was the strongest among the four.

He couldn’t help but ask when he noticed that Huang Xiaolong chose to remain silent after saying that people were approaching them.

In fact, he was also suspicious about Huang Xiaolong’s claim. Even though his understanding of the power of space wasn’t at perfection level, it was at the large completion stage! With his strength, he felt that no one would be able to escape his detection if they entered the sea of flames. He made several checks previously, and he failed to detect anyone.

A sense of suspicion formed in his heart when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Glancing at Chen Zhenghong from the corner of his eye, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “They’re right above us. However, they’re probably planning to make their move after the formation is destroyed.”

Zhu Wuxing, another one of the four experts, frowned. “Making a move after we break the restriction? How do they know we’re destroying the formation?” He turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong doubtfully. Even though no one said it, they felt that Huang Xiaolong was the one who notified the other party.

Hua Xingfeng, another one of the four, looked at Huang Xiaolong and sneered, “How would they know of our location?”

Every single expert on Zeng Ying’s side locked onto Huang Xiaolong’s group instantly.

Yuan Tianyi couldn’t help but snort in amusement when he looked at them. “One of you betrayed your princess, and now you’re trying to push the blame onto someone else? Are you stupid?”

“Do you really think His Highness is some sort of pushover you can blame as you like?”

Yuan Tianyi released his aura as soon as he spoke.

The experts serving under Zeng Ying exclaimed in shock when they noticed his strength.

“Nine elements at perfection level!”

During the auction, Yuan Tianyi had only comprehended eight elements to perfection level. That was well-known to everyone, but now, there was another element!

The difference between someone who reached perfection level in eight elements and nine elements was huge!

The atmosphere instantly turned stale.

The smell of gunpowder was in the air, and the two parties seemed to be ready to come to blows at any time.

One of the Silver Haired Old Men stood out and tried to diffuse the situation. “Alright. There’s no need to get so worked up. There’s no need to suspect anyone here. The Purple Lightning Young Master is a friend of Her Highness, and there’s no way he will betray us. We’ll talk about it when Her Highness emerges!”

As the five of them were focused on breaking the formation, none of them knew about the situation going on with Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

Finally, the experts on Zeng Ying’s side backed down. However, they remembered to keep their guards up against Huang Xiaolong.

Chen Zhenghong growled, “We’ll definitely talk about this when Her Highness emerges! If I discover anyone who betrayed us, I’ll kill you whoever you are!” It was clear he referred to Huang Xiaolong.

Yuan Tianyi snorted and the urge to beat Chen Zhenghong up rose in his heart. Luckily for Chen Zhenghong, Huang Xiaolong stopped him.

“We’ll talk about it after they emerge.”

Something fishy was definitely going on.

According to logic, Chen Zhenghong and the others were working for Zeng Ying. There was no way they would betray her. Otherwise, she wouldn’t dare to bring them along anyway.

However, if they weren’t the ones who did it, who else could it be? Could it be Hao Yi, Xu Fu, or Bai Xugang?

However, all of them swore an oath before starting on the journey.

According to logic, they would be punished by the grand dao if they violated their oath!

Unless…

As they needed more than a month to shatter the restriction, Huang Xiaolong and his party decided to cultivate peacefully. He didn’t think much about Chen Zhenghong’s outburst previously.

Even though they were pretty strong, Huang Xiaolong could get rid of them in several breaths of time if a fight broke out.

The only reason he didn’t slap all of them into oblivion was because of Princess Zeng Ying. otherwise, all of them would be beaten up so bad their parents wouldn’t be able to recognize them.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes snapped open all of a sudden and a ray of frosty light flashed through them.

He detected another group who entered the sea of flames, and they were headed straight for them!

Getting to his feet, Huang Xiaolong could feel that the newcomers were much stronger than those who arrived half a month ago.

“Your Highness?” Yuan Tianyi frowned when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s behavior.

“An expert is here.” Huang Xiaolong wasn’t careless this time. He even reminded Yuan Tianyi and Li Shuo that the newcomers were strong.

When they heard what Huang Xiaolong said, they knew that the person who arrived was no weakling. Anyone Huang Xiaolong was wary of was definitely a supreme expert.

“Get ready for battle.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Replying softly, the two of them started to circulate the energy in their bodies.

When Chen Zhenghong failed to detect anyone, he sneered, “Stop being pretentious.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong’s pupils constricted. This time, a giant flying ship was making its way over!
