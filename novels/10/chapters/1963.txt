“Siege and kill?” Suddenly, Dun Ei snickered mockingly as he looked at Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi. “You are capable of besieging and killing Huang Xiaolong? Before Huang Xiaolong broke through to Emperor Realm, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming and Chiyou Archdevil joined hands yet they failed to kill Huang Xiaolong in the Devil World. Even when they failed to kill him, can you?”

Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi was embarrassed by Dun Ei’s words and could not find any retort.

“Even if we won’t be able to kill him, we could stop him from refining the Radiance Ancestor’s other half of the inheritance.”

Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi went on stubbornly, “As long as Huang Xiaolong can’t get the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance, we still have a chance. At the same time, we can delay Huang Xiaolong while waiting for the reinforcements from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts!” They had expected Huang Xiaolong to come there, so they had got in touch with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe early on.

Dun Ei shook his head, “Shi Ming is still forging the grandmist treasure artifact Blade of Death. So, he won’t be able to come here personally. Without Shi Ming, it’s useless no matter how many Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts they send over.”

“Then, are we going to sit and watch Huang Xiaolong get the other half of Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance?!”

Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi almost roared out his unwillingness. His hatred towards Huang Xiaolong had long passed the point of reconciliation. His Brightness Emperor Palace would not be destroyed if it wasn’t for Huang Xiaolong, and he wouldn’t need to flee and hide in the Radiance World like a beaten-down dog.

“It doesn’t matter even if Huang Xiaolong really gets the other half of the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance and acknowledged by the Radiance World’s pure origin energy.” Dun Ei sneered coldly and went on, “I have the Radiance Divine Seal in my hands. As long as I hold the Radiance Divine Seal, I am the Radiance World’s Radiance Lord.”

“Huang Xiaolong’s dreaming if he thinks he can make me hand over the Radiance Divine Seal! Moreover, the Radiance Divine City is infallible as it’s built using various divine materials by the Radiance Ancestor. It’s comparable to a grandmist treasure artifact. Even if Huang Xiaolong steps into Sovereign, he won’t be able to break past the Radiance Divine City’s defenses. As long as I remain in the Radiance Divine City, it’s not Huang Xiaolong’s turn to swagger in this Radiance World!” Dun Ei’s grim voice echoed through the hall.

That was also his last line of defense. The Radiance Divine City was also known as the strongest fort in existence, and some even compared it to the Ancient Heavenly Court. Thus, Dun Ei was confident that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to do anything to him even if he got the other half of the inheritance.

“But it’s a pity. The Radiance Ancestor has left a word that whoever obtains his inheritance, that person would be the master of the Radiance Knight Corp.” Dun Ei sighed hopelessly. In other words, after obtaining the full inheritance, Huang Xiaolong could take over the Radiance Knight Corp, and that meant half of the Radiance World’s power.

......

In the meantime, above the Sea of Radiance, Huang Xiaolong had disappeared into the Heavenly Hall through the door in a flicker.

Similar to the first time, the moment Huang Xiaolong passed through the Heavenly Hall’s door, he was entirely enveloped by a gentle radiant light. It was so comfortable that his soul wanted to groan in pleasure.

Based on his previous experience, Huang Xiaolong proceeded with more familiarity this time. He quickly sat down and circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to absorb the sacred light’s energy. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This was the Radiance World’s pure origin energy, and its preciousness was comparable to the grandmist aura.

The moment Huang Xiaolong started absorbing, the radiance origin energy began to rush toward him and entered his body, reaching every part of him. He was the sacred light itself.

While Huang Xiaolong refined and absorbed the pure radiance origin energy, the one hundred Undead Netherguards removed the one hundred Radiance Divine Stone from the core points per Huang Xiaolong’s earlier instruction.

The Array of Origin’s power stopped circulating when all the Radiance Divine Stones were removed from the core points. The Heavenly Hall’s door slowly shut itself, and the Heavenly Hall once again sunk to the hidden space at the bottom of the sea.

Subsequently, the Radiance Angels and four odd beasts executed methods to hide the Array of Origin and then concealed themselves in various corners in the vicinity. They waited for Huang Xiaolong to come out after obtaining the complete inheritance.

Calmness returned to the surrounding sea.

While Huang Xiaolong was refining the other half of the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance, a piece of shocking news spread out from the Radiance World.

“What!? The Son of Light has broken through to mid-level Emperor Realm in one fell swoop, advancing to Fourth Order Emperor?! Impossible, right? The Son of Light hasn’t been cultivating for more than thirty thousand years!”

“Realer than gold, when the Son of Light was breaking through, there were many Emperor Realm pontiffs present. The Son of Light is our Radiance World’s number one genius. His talent has superseded the past Radiance Ancestor. He would definitely be able to control the Radiance Divine Seal and take over His Highness Archbishop’s position. He will unify our Radiance World!”

“Also, our Son of Light has put up a battle stage at the Reverence Moon Divine City. He has invited talented peers of other worlds for a battle. Anyone below the bone-age of one hundred thousand years can challenge him. It can be any disciple, who meets the criterion, from the Divine World, hell, Devil World, Buddha World, or even the Demon World!”

“For real? Challenging the whole universe’s same generation’s geniuses? That...! I’ve heard the Divine World’s Heavenly Prince Di Jing has the number one Heavenly Dao Godhead. There is another terrifying individual called Huang Xiaolong with three king of supreme godheads. Not to mention, the Buddha World’s Pu Ti is said to be the reincarnation of a Great Buddha! Could our Son of Light defeat him?!”

“What’s Huang Xiaolong considered as? He merely got better luck than others, getting hit by the Lord of Hell’s inheritance. Although his cultivation speed is shocking, it’s all piled up by treasures. His foundation is definitely not stable. Not to mention, Huang Xiaolong has only advanced to Emperor Realm for a short time. How is he a worthy opponent for our Son of Light? Much less the Heavenly Prince Di Jing and Buddha World’s Pu Ti!”

“The battle stage will be put up for a decade. Let’s see if that Huang Xiaolong, Heavenly Prince Di Jing, and that Pu Ti would dare to challenge!”

The Son of Light had been cultivating for less than thirty thousand years, yet he had already reached the mid-level Emperor Realm. He has also issued a challenge to the younger generation of geniuses from the Divine World, Hell, Buddha World, Devil World, and Demon World. The news caused a big stir.

In a short time, geniuses from various worlds made their way to the Radiance World to challenge the Son of Light.

......

The Divine World’s Heavenly Court.

When the Heavenly Prince Di Jing heard the news, he harrumphed coldly, “That Son of Light has merely cultivated for twenty thousand years more than me. There will be a day where I’ll pinch him to death like an ant!”

But at his current strength, Di Jing had to admit he could not defeat the Son of Light unless he too advanced to Fourth Order Emperor Realm. At that level, he could probably defeat the Son of Light. Even though he had the first-ranked Heavenly Dao Godhead, he couldn’t help but acknowledge that the Son of Light was highly talented as well.

“I’ve heard that Huang Xiaolong went to the Radiance World.” A light glimmered in Heavenly Emperor Di Jun’s eyes as he went on, “If the other half of the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance falls in his hand, it will be even harder to suppress him.”

Hearing that, the Heavenly Prince Di Jing suddenly said, “Father, in a few days, I’m going to the City of All-Heavens.”

Heavenly Emperor Di Jun’s eyes widened in astonishment, “What? Do you want to go to the City of All-Heavens? No, absolutely not! Although you’ve already broken through to Emperor Realm, it’s still too dangerous for you to go to the City of All-Heavens! It’s too risky. Ninety percent, you’re going to lose your life!”

Heavenly Prince Di Jing shook his head, “I know the City of All-Heavens is dangerous, but if I don’t go, I will never be able to defeat Huang Xiaolong. Especially if Huang Xiaolong obtains the other half of the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance, his strength would far surpass mine. The City of All-Heavens is my only hope.”
