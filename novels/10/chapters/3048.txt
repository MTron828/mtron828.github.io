Chapter 3049: Jin Hongyuan Is Not Qualified to Challenge His Highness

No one believed this was true.

More accurately, it was Jin Xiaoxiao, Jin Hongyuan, and Li Xu, who hadn’t believed that Senior Commander Liu Yu and the several million strongmen of the Golden Fox Army could get wiped out!

Ever since Jin Hongyuan had taken the helm of Golden Fox Heavenly Cave, becoming the Golden Fox Dao Venerable, something like this had never happened before. Although there were casualties in the Golden Fox Army, it was one or two soldiers at most, as assassinations were carried out through detailed planning and various disguises.

The Golden Fox Army had never lost any Dao Venerable level expert.

Never!

But now, exactly one hundred of Golden Fox Army’s Dao Venerable experts were wiped out!

Even a powerful expert like Senior Commander Liu Yu had fallen! And the other party had done all of this openly, and the whole world knew about it!

There were one hundred Dao Venerable experts, and several million Golden Fox Army strongmen!

While having a hard time believing it, his heart twisted in pain because whether it was the one hundred Dao Venerables or the several million experts of Golden Fox Army, it made his heart ache equally.

His Golden Fox Army was divided into three battalions, and the several million soldiers Liu Yu led was one of the three battalions. In other words, his Golden Fox Creed had lost one-third of the overall force!

One-third, ah!

How many years of accumulation, time, effort, and resources were spent to cultivate them?

“Leiyu Creed!” Jin Hongyuan’s frosty voice seemed to originate from hell, sending chills down everyone’s spines.

Li Xu and the others dared not utter a word.

Jin Xiaoxiao sat with a forlorn expression, her eyes clouded with a turmoil of complicated emotions. She still had not recovered from the news, and she trembled after recalling the scene at Xuan City where Old Monster Flame had slapped Li Dongjun and Yu Dong into the ground. If she had tried to stop Old Monster Flame with her Golden Fox Princess identity at that time, would he have slapped her into the ground as well?!

The more she thought about it, the more terrified she became.

“Does anyone know what exactly happened at that time?” Sometime later, Jin Hongyuan solemnly asked Li Xu, “How were Liu Yu and the others killed? Who killed them?”

Although they had received news that the entire battalion was wiped out, and even though the news had been verified, they still had no details on what exactly had taken place. No one had reported the details to him.

Li Xu hesitated before speaking, “We have an eyeliner at the Nine Vision Creed, but these eyeliner disciples have lost contact with us, hence, the details of what happened is still unclear!”

“But I don’t think it is the two of them that did it!” Li Xu explained his thoughts and conjecture, “If it’s only one or two people, it’s impossible that one person from Senior Commander Liu’s battalion survived!”

Another senior commander, Liang Fangyi, stepped forward and said, “This subordinate is of the same opinion as Senior Commander Li Xu. Except for that three-headed beast, flame old man, and the two Leiyu Creed’s disciples, there are twelve other people by that young man’s side.”

Jin Hongyuan inhaled deeply, then asked Li Xu, “Zhou Hong, Tan Hua, and Sui Hengyi, are they on their way here after receiving my order?”

Li Xu lowered his head. “Zhou Hong, Tan Hua, and Sui Hengyi are still at the Leiyu Creed’s headquarters, and there is no movement on their side.”

No movement!

Although Li Xu had not laid everything out on the table, it was clear to everyone that Zhou Hong, Tan Hua, and Sui Hengyi had disregarded Jin Hongyua, the Golden Fox Region Lord’s order.

Hearing the answer from Li Xu, Jin Hongyuan's gloomy face darkened further.

“Very good!” Cold light glinted in his eyes, “Since the Undefeated Creed was wiped out, I have not taken any action for many years. So now, even a small creed like Leiyu Creed dares to violate my order! Very good!”

“Lord, shall I lead the Golden Fox Army to the Leiyu Creed now, and annihilate the Leiyu Creed from top to bottom!” Li Xu went on, “At that time, I will capture Zhou Hong’s, Tan Hua’s, and Sui Hengyi’s dao souls back for you.”

Jin Hongyuan’s eyes narrowed dangerously, he suddenly asked, “That young man, where is he now?”

Li Xu froze for a second, and then hurriedly answered., “That young man is still at the Nine Vision Creed, but it is said his next target is the Devil Curse Creed, then the Panhu Creed, and Devil Blade Creed!”

“Release the word that I want to challenge him to a battle, and the time will be three months later at the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s highest peak!” Jin Hongyuan let the words roll off his tongue in a lazy drawl.

Everyone present was stunned by Jin Hongyuan’s words. No one had expected that he would make such a decision abruptly.

“Lord, you want to take action personally?” Li Xu asked dazedly, “Your status is noble, there is no need to lower your status to challenge him to a battle, that young man is only an unknown punk!”

In Li Xu’s opinion, there was no need to use a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken.

Jin Hongyuan was the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s highest authority, and on top of that, Jin Hongyuan was an expert on the Extermination List, ranked in sixtieth place. So, dealing with Huang Xiaolong personally was like raising his status.

“That’s right, Lord, we are enough to kill them all!” another senior commander chimed in.

Jin Hongyuan snickered harshly, “You all? Can any of you defeat him?”

The present Golden Fox Creed’s experts lowered their heads as no one said a word. Even when Dao Jianchou and Liu Yu couldn’t be that young man’s opponent, then who were they?

Although they had confidence in their own strengths, their strength was only as strong as Dao Jianchou and Liu Yu.

“Then, what do we do about the Leiyu Creed?” Li Xu asked. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

‘We’ll deal with Leiyu Creed after we’re done with that kid,” Jin Hongyuan said sullenly. He knew that the young man was the key, or it wouldn’t matter whether he annihilated the Leiyu Creed or not. Once that young man was dead, the Leiyu Creed would be akin to a fish on the chopping board that he could chop or slice as he pleased!

“Father, should we discuss this matter with godfather first?” Jin Xiaoxiao suddenly spoke. Although she believed in her father’s strength, for some reason, she felt insecure, or more accurately, uneasy.

Jin Hongyuan shook his head, “After your celebration banquet, your godfather entered the Heavens Burial Lands for something important. He won’t be able to come back in a short time.”

Seeing his daughter’s troubled expression, Jin Hongyuan laughed casually, “Don’t worry, your Father is confident about this!”

A world deterring aura spread from his body.

Under the Golden Fox Army’s deliberate promotion, soon, the news of Jin Hongyuan wanting to challenge Huang Xiaolong to a battle reached every corner of the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave.

The Golden Fox Heavenly Cave boiled with excitement.

“The Golden Fox Dao Venerable wants to challenge that young man to a battle at the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s highest peak!”

The Panhu Creed Patriarch Wu Shengyuan, who had been anxious like an ant on a hot pan, was overjoyed when he heard the news.

“Haha, I didn’t expect that Lord Golden Fox Dao Venerable would handle this matter personally, that young man and his subordinates are dead for sure!”

The Panhu Creed’s Eminent Elders laughed exuberantly after hearing the news, as if they were reborn.

“He’s courting death. How dare he have several million of Golden Fox Army’s strongmen killed? It’s granted that Lord Golden Fox Dao Venerable would be furious, and wants to kill that punk with his own hands!”

One after another creed and forces were discussing the same subject, each with their own reaction.

Huang Xiaolong who was organizing the Nine Vision Creed headquarters’ forces, laughed unconcernedly when he heard the news. “Jin Hongyuan finally couldn’t sit back any longer.”

Lei Yu followed up, “Jin Hongyuan is not qualified to challenge Your Highness, better let me take the challenge!”
