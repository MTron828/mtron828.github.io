Chapter 2208: Young Master Huang is Fine

Under Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze, Wang Junhai and the rest of the guards felt a sense of fear creeping up their hearts.

“It won’t be too late if you guys scram now!” Huang Xiaolong said with indifference.

Wang Junhai was startled for a second before he snapped in rage, “How dare a piece of trash like you tell me what to do? Do you believe...”

Before the words could leave his lips, his eyes were bedazzled, in the next second, a strong force sent him flying. He landed on the ground outside the courtyard.

A loud “thud” echoed through the air. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Wang Junhai slumped on the ground, and no one knew if he was still alive.

The guards who had come along with him stared at the scene before them in fright. Their bodies froze, and none of them dared to make a single move.

Of course, Wang Junhai wasn’t the only housekeeper in the manor. Even though he wasn’t the strongest amongst them, he was still an expert in the God King Realm! Moreover, he was a late-Third Order God King!

Did the cripple just...?

“Get lost!” Huang Xialong yelled.

The guards felt their bodies trembling and they ran out of the courtyard in fright. Grabbing Wang Junhai, they disappeared from Huang Xiaolong’s sight.

When they were gone, Huang Xiaolong started to practice the Final Boundless Sword Art.

Even though he no longer had a sword, it was nothing for him to form a sword using the natural spiritual qi in the air. With a single thought, sword light flashed in the courtyard continuously.

The sword qi around his body was like a tide as it flooded the entire courtyard. His control over the sword qi was perfect as not a single bit spilled out of the yard.

As he practiced the Final Boundless Sword Art, Zhang Wenyue was training her sword art in her personal courtyard. Whenever she waved her sword, a dragon would emerge and soar across her courtyard.

The sword art she practiced was one of the highest grade divine arts the manor possessed. It was called the Coiling Dragon Sword Art, and at the highest level, one would be able to summon ten thousand dragons.

After several moves, Zhang Wenyue paused as a frown appeared on her face. No matter how hard she practiced, the number of dragons she could produce was capped at nine hundred. She failed to break through the limit of a thousand regardless of the method she used.

When the nine hundredth dragon was condensed, something would go wrong and obstruct the rest of the sword qi she controlled.

“There are only several more days until the Big Dipper Sword Sect starts their recruitment...” Zhang Wenyue muttered to herself. No matter what, she had to break through the one thousand dragon’s mark before the recruitment exercise!

The Big Dipper Sword Sect was one of the three supreme sects in the Falling Jade Dynasty.

The Falling Jade Dynasty possessed countless kingdoms and there were an uncountable number of races under their umbrella. There were tons of geniuses fighting for a slot in any of the three supreme sects. After obtaining a place in the Big Dipper Sword Sect, her father’s status in the kingdom would rise to insurmountable heights. The Prince Qian Manor would undoubtedly become one of the powerhouses! Even the king himself wouldn’t be able to do a thing to them!

Despite staying at home for a period of time, she had heard from outside sources that Prince Long of the Long Prince Manor was trying to instigate the king to take action against them. According to the rumors, the Long Prince was moving against them under the guise that Prince Qian was of another race! According to Prince Long, the Prince Qian Manor was colluding with the Black Devil Sect to expand their forces!

Due to Prince Long’s instigation, the king was losing his trust for the Prince Qian Manor. The moment the king turned his spearhead towards her father, Prince Qian, it would spell their demise!

The only way for her to prevent anything of the sort from happening was for her to enter the Big Dipper Sword Sect. It was even better if she could catch the eye of an elder in the Emperor Realm. If she became a personal disciple of such an expert, all their problems would be solved.

There was one problem though. Entering the Big Dipper Sword Sect was harder than ascending to the heavens!

The Big Dipper Sword Sect only accepted a hundred disciples every time they opened their doors. Every time a selection took place, the number of disciples who signed up would number in the millions. Every genius in the Falling Jade Dynasty would sign up in hopes of joining one of the three supreme sects!

When the Big Dipper Sword Sect recruited disciples, one of the most important tests was to assess the disciple’s swordsmanship. No matter what, she had to reach the next level in Coiling Dragon Sword Art in order to be considered!

Just as Zhang Wenyue was deep in her thoughts, a maid walked in with an anxious expression plastered on her face.

“What’s the matter?” Zhang Wenyue asked.

“Princess, Housekeeper Wang brought several guards over to the Elegant Courtyard to chase Young Master Huang out!” The maid reported.

In the past few days, Zhang Wenyue had sent the maids to snoop around, and she had managed to learn of Huang Xiaolong’s true name.

Zhang Wenyue’s expression turned chilly. “How dare Wang Junhai chase my guest out of the Elegant Courtyard?!”

“According to sources from Young Master Zhang’s courtyard, Young General Chen is coming over tomorrow and he wanted to empty the Elegant Courtyard to host the general!”

Zheng Wenyue was startled for a second. However, she quickly asked with concern, “How is Young Master Huang’s injuries? Did anything happen to him?” Sheathing her sword, she prepared to charge over to the Elegant Courtyard.

“Young Master Huang is fine!” The maid stared at Zhang Wenyue with a weird expression on her face. “Housekeeper Wang was sent flying out of Elegant Courtyard!”

Zhang Wenyue stopped and stared at the maid in disbelief. Were her ears playing tricks on her?

“Housekeeper Wang was sent flying? Are you sure Young Master Huang wasn’t the one who was hurt?”

The maid hesitated for a second and she stuttered, “This... I’m not too sure about the specifics! I heard from the others that Housekeeper Wang was sent flying by Young Master Huang with a single strike.” The maid was unsure of what she had heard as it seemed completely impossible for the ‘cripple’ to send a God King flying.

Zhang Wenyue no longer bothered with the maid as she quickly made her way to the Elegant Courtyard.

By the time she arrived in the Elegant Courtyard, Wang Junhai had already arrived in the physician’s courtyard.

“Physician Lin, how is Housekeeper Wang’s condition?” The little prince, Zhang Haochen, asked the manor’s physician.

Physician Lin shook his head, “His opponent’s technique is rather unique. Wang Junhai won’t be able to regain consciousness without a month of rest. It seems like his opponent showed mercy. When he wakes up, he shouldn’t suffer from any long-term injuries.”

“Young master, who exactly did Housekeeper Wang offend?” Physician Lin asked.

Zhang Haochen thought for a second, and he growled, “Several days ago, my sister saved an ugly b*stard whose meridians and spirit sea were shattered. Housekeeper Wang was done in by that *sshole!”

Physician Lin couldn’t hide his shock as he yelled, “What? How is that possible? That kid is on the verge of death and I personally diagnosed him! He’s no different from a cripple, and he shouldn’t be able to circulate qi in his body!”

Zhang Haochen thought about it for a second and asked, “Is it possible for that brat to fake his injuries?”

“Impossible!” Physician Lin shook his head. “It’s absolutely impossible to fake an injury of that degree.”

“How else can he harm Housekeeper Wang?” Zhang Haochen continued, “The guards around are sure that the kid was the one who made the move! It’s impossible to be staged!”

Physician Lin groaned as he had no idea how to explain the situation to the young master.

A light flickered in Zhang Haochen’s eyes. “He shouldn’t be that weak if he dealt with Housekeeper Wang with a single move. He might even be a high-level God King Realm cultivator!”

“Young Master, should we... hire Master Yin to take action?” One of the guards stepped forward and suggested.

There were a few esteemed masters in the Prince Qian Manor. Every one of them was a Heavenly Monarch, and the Master Yin they spoke of was an early-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm expert!
