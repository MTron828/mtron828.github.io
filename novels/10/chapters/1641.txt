Another Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Zhang Xiaomeng also laughed. “Here I was thinking I could have some fun slaughtering. My Black Phoenix Blade hasn’t drunk fresh blood to her content for a long time. It seems I could only wait for the next opportunity.”

“Who would dare to defy our Massacring Gods Gate’s army? Now, even the Devil Scorpion Tribe has submitted to us, and soon, it would be the Dragon Bone Sect, Wind Devil Sect, and the Black Gold Cult. In a few thousand years, we can begin slaughtering the Netherworld King’s Organisation!” Another Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor, Kang He laughed wantonly.

“I don’t think it would take a few thousand years, in another several hundred years, we would be able to uproot the whole Netherworld King’s Organisation!”

“Not just the Netherworld King’s Organisation. If it was up to me, we could go and attack all the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s branches right now and cut them clean! If they know what’s good for them like the Devil Scorpion Tribe and submit to us, we can consider sparing their dog lives!”

The remaining Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors spewed similar sentiments, one laughing louder and madder than the other.

For a moment, the Massacring Gods Gate’s camp was full of happy laughter.

“Let’s go, have all the Grand Elders gather the army and enter the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s palace together!” Ancestor Gao Yu loudly issued an order, cutting short the happy atmosphere.

The rest of Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors complied and went off to instruct the Grand Elders under them to gather the army, as they prepared to enter the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s land!

A short while later, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors flew into the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s land with the intimidating army of one billion right behind them.

Soon, the Massacring Gods Gate army saw the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s opulent palaces that stretched farther than the eye could see. The eyes of the Massacring Gods Gate’s army shone with undisguised greed at the sight of these opulent palaces.

“I’ve heard the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Tong has a baby daughter, what’s her name again? Shi Mei’er, isn’t it? She is hailed as one of the Mohe Plane’s three great beauties. Moreover, it seems that she’s born with an innate Ice Charm Physique that could charm the life out of you.” Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Gao Yu suddenly laughed lecherously.

“Haha, even Brother Gao Yu has heard of Shi Mei’er. Tell Shi Tong to bring his daughter Shi Mei’er out later so she can pay her respects to Brother Gao Yu. Brother Gao Yu can give her some cultivation advice, and Shi Tong couldn’t be happier with that.” Ancestor Zhang Xiaomeng grinned meaningfully.

“Brother Gao Yu is an inexorable expert, and his ‘treasure sword’ is not rusted at all. It is Shi Mei’er greatest fortune that she will get the cultivation ‘advice’ from Brother Gao Yu.” Another Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor joined in the joke.

As the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors joked around, they had arrived at the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s main palace buildings.

At this time, several hundred figures flew out from the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s main palace building, stopping in midair. This group was naturally Huang Xiaolong, Jin Yuan, and the group of Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Eminent Elders, Grand Elders, and Elders.

As Huang Xiaolong did not want to expose his identity so early on, he, Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, Tai Yue, and Wan Yutian concealed themselves and followed at the back of the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s group.

Upon seeing the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Ancestor Shi Yihai, Patriarch Shi Tong, and the rest coming outside, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors flew forward, stopping several hundred meters opposite the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s group.

Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Gao Yu looked at Shi Yihai and Shi Tong, and a meaningful smile curved up the corners of his mouth as he spoke, “Shi Yihai, Shi Tong, a wise man recognises current affairs. It’s a good thing that you understood your circumstances and made a better decision. Opening the grand formation array and submitting to our Massacring Gods Gate is the best choice. Don’t worry, we will not mistreat the Devil Scorpion Tribe!”

Shi Yihai and Shi Tong were stunned for a moment hearing Gao Yu’s words, then laughed out loud.

Upon seeing that Shi Yihai and Shi Tong had suddenly burst out in a loud laughter, the Massacring Gods Gate’s side also joined them in their laughter, assuming that Shi Yihai and Shi Tong had agreed to submit to the Massacring Gods Gate.

The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Zhang Xiaomeng spoke. “Shi Tong, I’ve heard that you have a precious baby daughter named Shi Mei’er. It has been a long time since our Brother Gao Yu last accepted a disciple and he wants to accept your daughter as his disciple. This is double happiness ah, quickly call your daughter to come pay her respects to her Master.”

“Congratulations, Patriarch Shi Tong.”

The other Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors were quick to congratulate with a mean spirit.

Shi Yihai’s laughter stopped abruptly and his expression was icy and gloomy as he said, “Who said that because we let you inside, it means that we’re going to submit to the Massacring Gods Gate? What the f*ck is the Massacring Gods Gate? Why don’t you go look at yourself in the mirror?”

The atmosphere turned deathly quiet the moment Shi Yihai finished speaking.

The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors’ laughter was stuck in their throats.

But suddenly, Ancestor Gao Yu’s laughter reverberated in the air once more.

“Shi Yihai, are you certain the words you just spoke are not a joke?” Ancestor Gao Yu stared at Shi Yihai. His laughter now bore thick malice.

The Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Tong chimed in, “Gao Yu, if you and the army behind you choose to submit to my Devil Scorpion Tribe right now, I can spare your lives.”

Shi Tong’s words stupefied the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors. In the next moment, all of them exaggeratedly erupted in laughter.

Icy coldness spread in Ancestor Zhang Xiaomeng’s eyes. A black light flashed from his hand as a big blade appeared in his hand. On the big blade’s body was the totem of a black phoenix.

Zhang Xiaomeng caressed the edge of the big blade lovingly as he spoke, “I thought my Black Phoenix Blade won’t be able to drink blood to her content this time around, so I was feeling a teeny bit disappointed just now. Isn’t it great? She can drink happily now.” As he said this, he pointed the tip of the blade at Shi Yihai and Shi Tong, “Shi Yihai, Shi Tong, which of you wants to die first?!”

Rays of blade light shot out, whizzing in the air.

“Wait!” Someone flew out from the back of Shi Yihai’s group and knelt on one knee in front of Zhang Xiaomeng, “I, Zhang Hongbo, am willing to submit to the Massacring Gods Gate!”

“I, Ma Bing, am willing to submit to the Massacring Gods Gate!”

“I, Zhang Haining, am willing to submit to the Massacring Gods Gate!”

Subsequently, another two people flew out from Shi Yihai’s group and knelt in front of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Gao Yu and the rest.

These three people were exactly the same three Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Eminent Elders who were keen to form an alliance with the Massacring Gods Gate. Their strengths were between First Order and Second Order Emperor Realm.

As these three Eminent Elders chose to submit to the Massacring Gods Gate, the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Grand Elders and Elders under them followed their leads and submitted as well.

The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Gao Yu was extremely satisfied looking at the group of Devil Scorpion Tribe kneeling in front of him. He nodded his head and said, “Very good, stand up all of you. In a little while, all of you will realize how wise this decision is.”

Zhang Hongbo and the others stood up and retreated to the side. Gao Yu’s eyes were filled with bloodlust as he stared at Shi Yihai and Shi Tong. He smacked his lips and split them into a big grin. “Don’t worry, after you die, I will take real good care of your daughter. But I’m very curious to know what your trump card is that you dare to stand up against our Massacring Gods Gate? You even have the face to say that you would spare our lives?”

Shi Yihai and Shi Tong’s actions made him suspicious and doubtful. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this time, Huang Xiaolong, Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, Tai Yue, and Wan Yutian also walked out from the back of the group.

Seeing this, the Massacring Gods Gate’s side was even more baffled.

Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, Wan Yutian, and Tai Yue had not appeared in public for many years, moreover, they had changed their outer appearances, therefore, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors failed to recognise them.

“Close all exits.” After appearing, Huang Xiaolong ordered Shi Yihai.

“Yes, Master!” Shi Yihai respectfully complied.

What? Master?!

After hearing the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Ancestor Shi Yihai address an Asura noble as Master, not only the Massacring Gods Gate, but even the others on the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s side were shocked.

Under Shi Yihai’s order, the opened pathways through the grand formation arrays were instantly closed off. The grand formation arrays now trapped all the Massacring Gods Gate’s army inside.

Seeing this, the several Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors exchanged a glance with surprised expressions mirroring each other.
