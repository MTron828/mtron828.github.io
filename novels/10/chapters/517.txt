Hence, Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti left the Xie Manor, walking in the direction of the Duanren Institute. It didn’t take long for the two of them long to reach the institute.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the institute’s entrance. In his eyes, it was as if nothing had changed, everything gave the same sense of familiarity, just as he remembered them to be.

The two of them walked through the entrance, casually strolling along the corridors.

“I really cannot figure out how you cultivate. Even the Deities Templar’s Temple Preceptor was done in by you!” Xie Puti sighed with many conflicting emotions.

By now, the news of Temple Preceptor Ying Tian’s death had spread, raising another great wave of shock through the Martial Spirit World. But then again, the Deities Templar headquarters’ destruction was an open secret.

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “In cultivation, other than talent, one’s luck is also very important.” Undeniably, luck played a big role in Huang Xiaolong’s road of cultivation, helping him achieve the strength he had today. If it weren’t for the many fortuitous encounters he had over the years, it would have been impossible for him to breakthrough to peak mid-Tenth Order Saint realm. Who knows if he would have stepped into Saint realm at this point at all?

Xie Puti too laughed, “If only I had half of your luck.” He himself possessed a grade thirteen superb talent martial spirit, and although it could hardly stand on par with Huang Xiaolong’s talent, it wasn’t worse by far. Despite that, he was only a mid-Ninth Order Xiantian realm.

Huang Xiaolong faintly smiled as a reply.

Both men took a stroll around the institute’s perimeter.

Two hours later, just as Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti were ready to leave Duanren Institute, suddenly, a panicked figure could be seen running in their direction. From that person’s wobbly movements, it seemed like that person was injured.

And there were five people chasing behind him.

Usually, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be bothered by these matters, but when he saw the wounded person’s face, he was a little surprised.

“Chen Cheng!” Huang Xiaolong called out.

Huang Xiaolong enrolled into Duaren Institute by participating in Duanren Empire’s Imperial City Battle through Luo Tong Kingdom’s Cosmic Star Academy. To his knowledge, other than him, there was only one other person who that went the same route, and that was Chen Cheng.

On the first day, when Huang Xiaolong came to report in at the Duanren Institute, he ran into Chen Cheng. Later on, because there were too many things happening, he did not pay much attention to Chen Cheng. He didn’t expect to meet him again today.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s voice, Chen Cheng raised his head. When he saw Huang Xiaolong’s face, there were shock and disbelief in his eyes, “Huang-Xiao-...!” But his voice faltered, not knowing how he should address Huang Xiaolong.

Should he call him by his name, Huang Xiaolong? Lord Beast God? Or Asura’s Gate Sovereign?

However, Huang Xiaolong already took a medicinal pellet out, cutting off his words, “This is a Water Fire Essence Pellet, good for healing, quickly swallow it down.”

Chen Cheng was touched, his hands trembling when he received the Water Fire Essence Pellet! Even though he was ignorant of the pellets’ grade, he believed that it would not be lower than a grade ten pellet.

He did not immediately swallow the healing pellet, instead, Chen Cheng looked at Huang Xiaolong, for this pellet was too valuable.

Huang Xiaolong nodded encouragingly as if knowing his thoughts, smiled as he said, “This kind of pellets, I have many, they are not useful to me.” This level of saint grade medicinal pellet, he truly did not attach much value to them, they weren’t much difference from garbage to him.

However, it wasn’t because Huang Xiaolong was unwilling to spend a divine grade spirit pellet on Chen Cheng, it was just that Chen Cheng’s cultivation was too low. His body and meridians were too fragile to withstand the medicinal effects of a divine grade pellet.

Hearing this, Chen Cheng no longer hesitated, immediately swallowing the pellet. Huang Xiaolong clapped a palm onto Chen Cheng’s body, channeling a strand of his saint power to assist Chen Cheng in refining the pellet before turning over to look at the five people pursuing Chen Cheng.

The five people caught up, stopping a few meters away from Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti, their eyes rolling over them before yelling, “We’re from Demon Sword Hall, I advise you two to better not stick your noses into other people’s affairs. Leave now, or else, hehe...!”

Demon Sword Hall? Huang Xiaolong turned to Xie Puti.

Xie Puti explained, “Demon Sword Hall was established by Young Noble Demon Sword.”

Huang Xiaolong immediately understood.

Huang Xiaolong was aware of the Duanren Empire’s famous five Young Nobles during that time; Young Noble Heartless Yao Fei, Young Noble Wuhen, Duan Wuhen, Young Noble Demon Sword, as for the other one, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t remember.

“Since you already know we’re from Demon Sword Hall, know your place and scram right now.” One of the five pursuers snickered, “I will count to three, and after that, you won’t be able to leave even if you want to.”

“One!” “Two!” That person barked: “Three!”

When he counted to three and saw the two men on the other side still standing there, a cold sneer appeared on his face as he looked over to his four comrades, “Move, cripple these two!”

The other four people pounced on Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, there was mirth concealed in his eyes. He barely made any move, a light flickered in his eyes and the four attackers were thrown back like they had received a heavy blow. Tremors ran through the earth as four bodies crashed to the ground.

Xie Puti, who was ready to retaliate, was stupefied for a second before a helpless smile hung on his face. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The person who seemed to be the leader of the five was baffled watching the other four others fly back for no apparent reason.

The passing Duanren Institute students heard the commotion on this side and a crowd began to gather.

“It’s those people from Demon Sword Hall!”

“Am I seeing things? There are people who dare to beat up the Demon Sword Hall’s people!”

Not so low whispers from the surrounding Duanren Institute students could be heard.

Heartless Young Noble Yao Fei was killed by Huang Xiaolong, while Young Noble Wuhen had been cultivating inside the Duanrean Palace. In the current Duanren Institute, Young Noble Demon Sword’s Demon Sword Hall inevitably became the hegemony power.

In the eyes of all Duanren Institute students, Demon Sword Hall was an existence that couldn’t be offended. It was bad luck to whoever offended them, it may even implicate their family.

The man turned over, glaring venomously at Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti, “Good, just you wait!” With that, that man wanted to leave to call for reinforcement.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent: “Come here.”

To the man’s horror, he actually discovered that his body was moving backwards out of his control, all the way until he was right in front of Huang Xiaolong.

“Go back and tell Young Noble Demon Sword to come see me.” Huang Xiaolong said.

All the gathered students were stunned when they heard Huang Xiaolong ordering Young Noble Demon Sword to come see him.

“Has this kid gone crazy? He actually ordered Young Noble Demon Sword to come see him? Who does he think he is!”

“It has been many years since Young Noble Demon Sword battled, do you think we have the chance to see him fight? I heard someone say that Young Noble Demon Sword is already a half-Saint!”

Huang Xiaolong’s words raised another round of buzzing whispers from the students all around. The last man from Demon Sword Hall was furious, but before he could curse out he caught the look in Huang Xiaolong’ eyes. The sharp piercing gaze akin to staring at the tip of a blade sent a bone biting chill in his heart. All the words he was about to say were swallowed back down.

With a light tap on the Demon Sword Hall disciple’s body, Huang Xiaolong sent him out in a beautiful arc across the sky, vanishing from everyone’s sight.

Although Xie Puti’s reputation in Duanren Institute was not small, he rarely appeared on the institute grounds, which was why only a small number of students could recognize him. As for Huang Xiaolong, it had been more than a decade since he last stepped into the Duanren Institute, people who knew him were even less. Even in the past, not many of the students had seen Huang Xiaolong.

That Demon Sword Hall disciple fell hard on the ground. Repressing the fury in his heart, he scrambled away in panic back to the Demon Sword Hall. The instant he got back to Demon Sword Hall, he headed straight toward the yard where Young Noble Demon Sword was cultivating.
