Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s confident expression, Liu Yun added an afterthought, “After advancing to mid-Second Order God Realm, Wang Biaoyuan’s Indestructible Vajra Physique is at least ten times stronger than it was three years ago.”

Due to Huang Xiaolong converging his aura, not even Liu Yun was able to see through his real cultivation. Therefore, despite knowing that Huang Xiaolong had amazing talent, he didn’t hold much confidence in Huang Xiaolong defeating Wang Biaoyuan tomorrow.

In fact, not only Liu Yun, the whole of Black Warrior Institute’s disciples, not a single person believed that Huang Xiaolong would be able to snatch the top spot this time. Nine-tenths of Black Warrior Institute’s disciples were trading words back and forth, and most agreed that the outer disciple assessment’s first place holder this time would be either Gudu Leng or Wang Biaoyuan.

To this point, Liu Yun continued, “Moreover, not only has Gudu Leng advanced to Second Order God Realm, I heard he has cultivated the Gudu Family’s supreme secret technique to the hundredth layer—reborn state, possessing regeneration power! His strength is probably more frightening than that Wang Biaoyuan’s!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. During the time of his closed-door practice, he had asked Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi about the Gudu Family’s Solitary God’s Infinitude, thus he was aware of this technique formidable powers. Despite knowing that Gudu Leng had successfully practiced the Solitary God’s Infinitude to the hundredth layer, Huang Xiaolong did not place the matter in his heart.

Noticing the indifference on Huang Xiaolong’s face, Liu Yun knew that Huang Xiaolong really did not mind Gudu Leng and Wang Biaoyuan, but he could only shake his head in secret. However, he did not say more to his Junior-Apprentice brother.

Both of them continued to drink while Liu Yun talked about matters related to cultivation. It was two hours later when Liu Yun took his leave.

After Liu Yun left, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said with a hint of mirth, “Little rascal Huang, obviously not even a single person believes that you’ll be able to take first place tomorrow ah, even your eldest Senior Apprentice-brother feels that you’re not Gudu Leng or Wang Bioyuan’s opponent. You must perform well tomorrow.”

Huang Xiaolong grinned, “Three years ago I was just a half-step God Realm, I cannot blame others if they don’t believe I can win the first place.”

A quiet night passed.

Inside a certain manor in the Black Tortoise World, Wang Biaoyuan’s stature flickered in unpredictable trajectories, resembling an agile butterfly in midair.

Moments later, Wang Biaoyuan landed noiselessly on the ground.

“Congratulations to Young Lord for reaching the ninth stage of the Flower Butterfly Fantasy Maneuver movement technique.” A similar Black Warrior Institute outer disciple from the Wang Family stepped forward with a flattering smile, “In tomorrow’s outer disciple assessment, the first place will surely belong to Young Lord!”

Wang Biaoyuan nodded with satisfaction, confidence surging from his body. Both of his fists tightly clenched as a sharp glint flickered in his eyes, “Huang Xiaolong, just you wait! The humiliation from three years ago, I’ll pay it back a hundred times. Tomorrow, in the assessment arena, I want you to kneel before me in front of everyone!”

Sensing the horrifying aura coming from Wang Biaoyuan’s body, that Wang Family disciple was frightened, taking a step back involuntarily.

“How are the things I ordered you to find out?” Wang Biaoyuan converged the aura surging out from his body, questioning the disciple.

That Wang Family disciple approached respectfully reporting, “In these three years, Huang Xiaolong has been in closed-door practice inside the Institute Principal’s Manor, he has yet to take one step out. Therefore, this subordinate is unable to find out the extent of his strength, however, according to this subordinate’s judgment, regardless of how they praise his heaven-defying talent and how bitterly he is cultivating, he cannot be more than a peak half-step God Realm.”

Wang Biaoyuan nodded in agreement.

“In this subordinate’s opinion, Young Lord defeating Huang Xiaolong tomorrow will absolutely be an easy matter. This time, Young Lord’s real opponent is Gudu Leng. From what this subordinate found out, that Gudu Leng has advanced to Second Order God Realm, moreover, his Solitary God’s Infinitude already reached the hundredth layer, definitely a formidable adversary.” That Wang Family disciple added.

Wang Biaoyuan said, “That Gudu Leng really succeeded in cultivating the Solitary God’s Infinitude to the hundredth layer, but, so what, I have the confidence to defeat him.”

At this time, the other outer disciples were also busy sharpening their swords and knives in order to compete for a chance to enter the top ten, top three, or even the first place!

Many outer disciples with hundred years of cultivation who participated in the previous assessments were vying for the same chance to be promoted to an inner disciple, and these outer disciples’ strength rivaled some inner disciple geniuses.

...

The night trickled by, giving way to the rising sun on the horizon, brightening the dark sky as the Black Warrior Institute began to hustle with an energetic buzz.

Although today was merely the outer disciples’ assessment, due to Huang Xiaolong’s status, as well as Gudu Leng, Wang Biaoyuan, and the others, the outer disciple assessment this time attracted the attention of many inner and elite disciples. Even the institute’s Elders and Grand Elders showed up.

Inside the inner hall of his yard, Huang Xiaolong, who was meditating, opened his eyes. Looking at the sunlight coming through the window, he stood up and walked out of the inner hall. Just as Huang Xiaolong passed by the main hall, he caught sight of the Institute Principal Feng Yang sitting in the main hall.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. Guessing that the Institute Principal was waiting for him, he approached saluting respectfully: “Master.”

Institute Principal Feng Yang nodded lightly with a smile on his face, his eyes took in everything as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “I have heard about the situation with Gudu Leng and Wang Biaoyuan, if you meet these two persons in the outer disciple assessment today, there’s no need force yourself, it’s good enough if you can enter the top three.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly in his heart. He didn’t expect the Institute Principal waited for him here just to say this. Looks like even his Master wasn’t so confident that he’d be able to win the first place.

Top three? That meant third place.

Was this the highest expectation his Master had for him in this outer disciple assessment?

“Yes, Master.” Huang Xiaolong replied.

Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang nodded, “Go, be careful.”

Huang Xiaolong answered affirmatively again, saluted, and left the manor, heading toward the assessment location. The outer disciple assessment was not conducted in the Supreme Harmony Hall but at the Hidden Dragon Arena. The Hidden Dragon Arena wasn’t that far away from Supreme Harmony Hall, it was built on the peak of a mountain several thousand li away from the it.

It didn’t take Huang Xiaolong much time to reach the peak where the Hidden Dragon Arena was located.

The mountain peak was lopped off by the Black Warrior Institute’s experts using Godforce and the Hidden Dragon Arena was built on the flat mountain surface. The large arena was forged from an extremely hard rock kernel, elevated half a meter from the ground, and was able to accommodate a few tens of thousands of people, whereas the area outside of the arena could take up to several hundred thousand.

“It’s Huang Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong’s arrival immediately stirred the crowd. The disciples that had arrived earlier all turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Ignoring these people’s gazes, Huang Xiaolong descended beside the Hidden Dragon Arena.

“I wonder how high Huang Xiaolong’s strength is after three years.”

“I’ll bet he’s a peak half-God Realm at most. Without great fortune, there’s no way he can break through to God Realm.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“If it’s like this, I’m afraid he can only enter the top three.”

“Top three? It’s already considered not bad if he can enter the top five.”

Similar mocking voices filled the arena.
