Chapter 2476: In Truth, I am Huang Xiaolong

A harsh derisive snicker escaped Ji Yu’s lips upon hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, and she responded menacingly, “Little guy, are you trying to frighten me? This area is merely the outer periphery of the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds, so I advise you not to be nosy. I am warning you that you’ll die miserably for offending our Blood Qilin Race!”

Although the Holy Heavens organization prohibited outsiders from taking aggressive actions within the holy grounds’ territory, it was not absolute. In general, actions taken in the outer peripheral region of the holy ground were usually ignored by the Holy Heavens’ law enforcement patrol as long as they didn’t make too big a movement, and the Holy Heavens generally did not pursue the matter after that.

This was also the reason why Ji Yu dared to make her move.

“I will die miserably for offending the Blood Qilin Race?!" Huang Xiaolong’s tone turned icy, “You lot better get lost right now, or else...!”

The Blood Qilin Race was one of the bigger races of the Holy World, and they were comparable to the Black Inferno Race, and Yang Dragon Race. The Blood Qilin Race’s status might intimidate others, but....

“Or else what?!” Ji Yu retorted in mockery, killing intent surging from her body.

“Die!” Huang Xiaolong said without any emotion.

Ji Yu was enraged, and just as she was about to order the Blood Qilin Race experts to attack, one of them came to her side and said something to her through voice transmission which made her eyes widened in surprise.

“Punk, you’re a Holy Heavens disciple?!” Ji Yu asked as she took a closer look at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly surprised by her change of tone, but he did not show it, “That’s right.”

Ji Yu frowned deeply as she tried again, “My father and the Holy Heavens’ Mission Hall’s Elder Ceng Ze are good friends. Looking at the sake of this connection, please do not interfere in this matter. We can give you ten high-grade holy spiritual jade stones for your troubles.”

After learning that Huang Xiaolong was a Holy Heavens organisation’s disciple, her attitude was much better.

Ten high-grade holy spiritual jade stones was quite a generous sum. Ji Yu planned to use this chance to leave a good impression on Huang Xiaolong, and build a connection with him. Using ten high-grade holy spiritual jade stones in exchange for the friendship of a Holy Heavens disciple was worth it.

As if worried Huang Xiaolong did not believe her, Ji Yu signaled one of the experts with her to take out ten high-grade holy spiritual jade stones, and offered them to Huang Xiaolong.

As he looked at the ten high-grade holy spiritual jade stones, Huang Xiaolong snickered in disdain. Am I merely worth ten high-grade holy spiritual jade stones?

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent, and threw back the ten high-grade holy spiritual jade stones with a flick of his sleeve.

Ji Yu’s face sank at Huang Xiaolong’s action.

Does he think it’s too little? Thinking of this, she had the expert add another two high-grade holy spiritual jade stones.

Upon seeing this, Huang Xiaolong smiled sarcastically. Twelve high-grade holy spiritual jade stones? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Naturally, Huang Xiaolong threw the twelve high-grade holy spiritual jade stones back to their faces.

“Little brother, one should not be too greedy.” A hint of anger seeped into Ji Yu’s voice, “Twelve high-grade holy spiritual jade stones could purchase a lot of pills for your cultivation needs.”

The sarcasm on Huang Xiaolong’s face deepened at her words, and he shook his head.

Twelve high-grade holy spiritual jade stones were enough to buy him a lot of pills? If Ji Yu knew that he only consumed holy pills to cultivate, Huang Xiaolong wondered what expression she would show.

Twelve high-grade holy spiritual jade stones could not even buy a piece of a holy pill’s skin. One could probably take a whiff of a holy pill’s scent if there were twenty high-grade holy spiritual jade stones.

Upon seeing Huang Xiaolong shake his head in disdain, Ji Yu’s face sank completely.

The Blood Qilin Race’s expert once again said something to Ji Yu through voice transmission.

Ji Yu nodded, and said to Huang Xiaolong, “In that case, we’ll take our leave for now!” She waved her hand towards the experts, who accompanied her, with a crisp order, “Let’s go!”

With that said, she left with the group of Blood Qilin Race’s experts, but they did not leave the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds. They flew towards the center region of the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds instead.

As she passed by Ji Cai, Ji Yu warned resentfully, “Don’t for one second assume that you’re safe after grabbing onto his thigh. He might not be able to protect you.”

Ji Cai’s calm face was immediately colored with anger.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Ji Yu and the Blood Qilin Race experts leave, and snickered. Judging from the direction they were going in, they were heading to the Holy Heavens City, probably looking for their backing, and their closest backing would naturally be the Mission Hall’s Elder Ceng Ze?

“Elder Brother, thank you!” After Ji Yu’s group was out of sight, Ji Cai approached Huang Xiaolong and gratefully thanked him.

“It’s alright. It was a small matter.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand with nonchalance.

“Elder Brother, are you really a disciple of the Holy Heavens organisation?” Ji Cai hesitated before braving herself to ask the question.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “A hundred percent genuine.”

Ji Cai’s eyes lit up as she asked, “Then, do you know His Highness Huang Xiaolong?”

Upon hearing that, Huang Xiaolong could already guess the little lassie’s intention. He smiled and asked, “You want me to introduce you to His Highness?”

Ji Cai nodded heavily, “Yes, I have heard that His Highness Huang Xiaolong is righteous and possesses heroism that reaches the sky. My purpose for coming to the Holy Heavens City is not only to pay homage to His Highness, but I also want to serve His Highness for a chance to avenge my father and several brothers in the future.”

Huang Xiaolong failed to hold back a chortle. Righteous with heroism that reaches the sky? Who started promoting me this way?

In truth, Huang Xiaolong was unaware that after the battle stage had ended that these rumors about him had grown increasingly out of hand, as if Huang Xiaolong had ten thousand arms and ten thousand legs. In short, there had never been any genius like Huang Xiaolong in history.

Huang Xiaolong stopped laughing and admitted, “Actually, I am Huang Xiaolong.”

Ji Cai and the old man were a little dumbfounded, looking at Huang Xiaolong’s very serious expression. Ji Cai suddenly covered her mouth to reduce the sounds of her giggles, “Elder Brother, this is not good, you are pretending to be His Highness Huang Xiaolong. If His Highness Huang Xiaolong finds out about it, the consequences would be severe.”

For a moment, Huang Xiaolong didn’t know how to explain it.

“Elder Brother, do you really know His Highness Huang Xiaolong? Can you introduce us?” Ji Cai asked. She was desperate, and coming to the Heavenly Master Holy Ground was her last hope.

“This is our Blood Qilin Race’s Blood Qilin Jade. If you can help introduce me, I can give this to you.” Ji Cai gritted her teeth with determination and took out a deep-red jade token after an episode of internal struggle.

“Blood Qilin Jade?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the Blood Qilin Jade in the young girl’s hand, and was inwardly surprised. The Blood Qilin Race attached great importance to the Blood Qilin Jade, and needless to say it was precious. Hence, Blood Qilin Jade was quite famous in the Holy World. This little girl was willing to take this out and give it to him?

Not to mention, she trusted him so much?! After all, they had not known each other for long.

“Princess!” The old man yelled upon seeing this, trying to keep the anxiety out of his voice as he dissuaded, “This cannot be done!”

Ji Cai shook her head, “Guard Chen, don’t persuade me. This Elder Brother can be trusted. Moreover, if I cannot avenge my father and my elder brothers, what’s the use of holding the Blood Qilin Jade in my hand!”

“Alright, I can help with this.” In the end, Huang Xiaolong nodded, but he did not collect the Blood Qilin Jade. Although a piece of Blood Qilin Jade was very valuable, Huang Xiaolong did not lack this kind of treasure.

After seeing Huang Xiaolong agree, Ji Cai was extremely happy, “Really? Thank you, Elder Brother!”

A while later, the group traveled onwards, flying towards the Holy Heavens City.

“Do you trust me so much?” As they traveled onwards, Huang Xiaolong asked Ji Cai out of curiosity, “Aren’t you afraid I might have ill-intentions towards you? Maybe, I might not really know His Highness Huang Xiaolong, and I might be tricking you.”

Ji Cai smiled sweetly at him as she answered, “Eyes are the windows to the soul, and Elder Brother’s eyes are clear, so I know Elder Brother won’t trick me.”

This was the reason?

“Right, Elder Brother, what is your name? I still don’t know your name until now.” Ji Cai asked again.

Huang Xiaolong was in a dilemma, but he still answered honestly, “My name is Huang Xiaolong.”
