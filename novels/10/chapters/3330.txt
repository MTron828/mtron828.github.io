Chapter 3331: Don’t Go Too Far

Everyone stared at the crater created by Chen Xingjian’s corpse with a look of disbelief.

“He… He dares?!” Ying Zhi stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. He didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would dare to make a move on anyone in the Purple Flame Sect.

Ying Tian couldn’t believe his eyes either. He shook his head and sighed, “If he tried his best to endure the humiliation, he might have lived. Now, he’s doomed. When Lord Ren Qi makes his move, Huang Xiaolong will die a horrible death.”

“That’s right. Lord Ren Qi probably used the shards of glass and nails to anger Huang Xiaolong into doing something wrong. Now, Huang Xiaolong is in a lot of trouble.” He Yuankang shook his head in pity.

“Huang Xiaolong is still too young. He doesn’t know how to control his temper.” Ying Tian sighed.

One of the eminent elders of the Purple Flame Sect roared in rage, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you touch our patriarch! You’re dead! You’re definitely going to die!” 

“Whap!” With a single slap, Huang Xiaolong sent the eminent elder down to the ground too. This time, cracks started to spread through the mountain.

“How dare you?!” a majestic voice emerged from the Purple Flame Sect and the soundwave contained enough power to wipe out several cities. The experts standing around felt their brains shaking in their skulls.

Another massive group of experts emerged from the mountain, and the three people in the lead were Ren Qi, Cao Gang, and Wu Guangsi. The experts of the three factions stood behind them obediently, and there were more than a few hundred experts in the Nascent Soul Realm or higher.

When Ren Qi looked at the corpses of Chen Xingjian and the eminent elder, a cold light flashed through his eyes. “I have decided that I won’t allow you to die alone. I will ensure that every one of the Huang Family and those related to you will die a death one thousand times more painful than those you killed!”

Ren Qi’s voice resounded in the minds of everyone present.

He released his aura completely, and the clouds in the skies started to move. A terrifying hurricane surrounded him, and he turned into the god of storms as he stood in the middle of the frightening wind flow.

A crushing pressure came down on those standing around the mountain, and they found it hard to breathe.

Everyone looked at Ren Qi with terrified expressions on their faces. Is that the strength of a Ninth Level Spirit Severing Realm expert?!

All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong reached towards the middle of the hurricane where Ren Qi stood.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re overestimating yourself! Senior Ren Qi’s strength is more than enough to tear ordinary experts in the mid-level Spirit Severing Realm into pieces!” Wang Xiwen cackled with laughter.

When everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong would be torn into shreds, his hand pierced through the howling gales. He casually grabbed Ren Qi’s neck as he dragged the man towards himself.

The terrifying winds stopped all of a sudden, and the world returned to its natural state.

A look of fear formed in Ren Qi’s eyes as he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

He used all the true qi he could muster, but he realized that he couldn’t move a single muscle in his body.

He was like a frail chicken dangling in the skies.

Everyone who was at the scene felt a bomb going off in their minds. The world seemed to stop as their jaws dropped in disbelief.

There were more than ten thousand experts from all over the world present, but not a single one dared to take a breath. Silence fell on the lands.

“Release Lord Ren Qi at once!” One of the eminent elders roared, “Otherwise, our Purple Flame Sect will…”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Before he could complete his sentence, Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and sent everyone from the Purple Flame Sect smashing into the mountain.

In an instant, several hundred holes that went deep into the ground appeared.

If one were to look at the mountain from afar, one would think that a shooting star split into several hundred pieces and struck the mountain.

Those who went crashing into the mountain were beyond dead. They were smashed into meat paste!

Sucking in a cold breath, the bodies of the experts from the Divine Court Sect and Ghost Valley froze in fear.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother looking at them as he looked at Ren Qi who was trying to struggle his way out. “Kill me? Killing everyone related to me?” With a single slap, he sent Ren Qi’s head spinning around his neck.

As his head spun clockwise around his neck, screams filled the air.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong made sure that he didn’t die. That was the extent of it. Ren Qi would have to suffer from the pain of getting his head twisted off his shoulders multiple times.

Heart-wrenching screams emerged from his lips.

As Ren Qi’s head spun around, the experts from all the other factions felt the world spinning around them.

After more than ten rounds, Ren Qi’s head finally stopped spinning. However, his face was facing the wrong way.

“Making sure everyone related to me dies a death a thousand times worse than those I killed?” 

Frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he slapped Ren Qi’s face again. This time, it spun the other way.

When his head finally stopped spinning, Huang Xiaolong sealed off Ren Qi’s true qi before throwing him to the bottom of the steps. “If you manage to climb up to the gates of the Purple Flame Sect in an hour, I’ll spare your life.”

“Remember to kowtow thrice every step.”

That was Ren Qi’s order before Huang Xiaolong had arrived.

Looking at the shards of glass and nails lining the steps, Ren Qi felt the blood draining from his face. However, he roared with laughter all of a sudden, “Huang Xiaolong, even if I die, I won't listen to you! You can kill me if you like!”

“Kill you?” Huang XIaolong raised a single eyebrow in amusement. “Not to worry. You shall experience a life worse than death.” Casually pointing at Ren Qi’s forehead, a ray of light entered his body. The squeals that came out from his lips were a thousand times more miserable than when his head was spinning around his neck. “I… I’ll climb! Please, please stop!”

“Too late.” 

Huang Xiaolong ignored Ren Qi who was trashing and rolling about the bottom of the steps.

The experts who were watching everything unfold felt their hearts trembling in fear. They didn’t know how much pain Ren Qi had to be in for a Ninth Level Spirit Severing Realm expert like him to be screaming as such.

As he turned to look at the experts of the other factions, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother thinking of a specific punishment for all of them. Their faces changed when they saw that Huang Xiaolong’s attention had turned to them.

With his gaze stopping on Cao Gang, Wu Guangsi, Wang Xuwen, and Liu Xulong, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “The four of you shall suffer the same punishment. Climb up from the bottom. If you arrive in an hour, I’ll allow you to live.”

Their expressions sank instantly.

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t go too far!” Liu Xulong roared in anger, “The experts from my Ice Palace will arrive in a few days! When that happens, you…”

Huang Xiaolong pointed at him and a ball of fire appeared on Liu Xulong’s eyebrows. With that as the origin, it started to spread towards other places of his body. He was reduced to ashes in the blink of an eye.
