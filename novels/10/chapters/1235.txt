Huang Xiaolong made an internal note of Wang Shi’s hostility towards him, on the other hand, he believed that the reason for Wang Shi’s hostility would surface in time.

When the round of greetings finished, Wang Shi led Golden Brow Ancestor and the rest into the residence that they had already arranged for them.

The residence was grand, imposing, and the environment had rich spiritual energy. Though, it couldn’t be compared to the spiritual energy inside the Fortune Divine Kingdom, it was better than Huang Xiaolong’s Myriad Gods Manor.

Huang Xiaolong guessed that there was a high grade five spiritual vein sealed under the Golden Wheel City and the residences in this area were close to the center of the spiritual vein.

The residence had a lot of rooms, enough to accommodate all of them with their own private courtyards. On top of that, each courtyard had a restrictive formation that made things convenient for Huang Xiaolong and the other disciples to cultivate with ease before the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle began.

Huang Xiaolong took a stroll around the courtyard that was arranged for him, and then went inside his room to activate the courtyard’s restrictive formation. He laid another formation around his room before finally sitting down cross-legged to cultivate.

Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had reached the limit of peak early Fourth Order Ancient God Realm; he had a feeling he could breakthrough to mid-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm in the next few days. Thus Huang Xiaolong decided to enter seclusion until he broke through to mid-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong circulated the four divine fires inside his body, and soon after,the chaos spiritual energy rushed down from the void like a waterfall within him; concurrently, the purple grandmist aura dragon started emitting a purple light and Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell, a silvery moonlight.

Huang Xiaolong’s three supreme godheads became even more radiant.

Times flew by as five days passed.

Inside the room, Huang Xiaolong was completely enshrouded by the chaos spiritual energy, purple grandmist aura, and silver moon essence. Suddenly, these three energies rippled; turning into waves, and then a high tide!

Rumble~!

The chaos spiritual energy, purple grandmist aura, and silver moon essence exploded suddenly. Shocking energy rose inside Huang Xiaolong’s body and spilled out like fireworks.

Mid-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm!

This exploded chaos spiritual energy, purple grandmist aura, and silver moon essence roiled backward and was completely swallowed up by Huang Xiaolong. When he finally stopped, an hour had passed.

As Huang Xiaolong had activated the courtyard’s restrictive formation along with an additional formation around his room, his breakthrough did not alert others in the residence.

Huang Xiaolong stood up and walked out of his room to the small yard outside and begin practicing with his sword.

In the next instant, sword qi started crisscrossing in the yard.

These rays of sword qi floated like water in the air, but strangely none of them flowed out of the yard area. They were also ever-changing—sometimes they exuded penetrating sharpness, sometimes they were as gentle as the drizzling rain, and the other times they became violent or even sullen without any warning.

At one point, all the rays of sword qi merged into a dragon, but then the dragon scattered into flowers in the next moment. Dazzling sword qi flowers bloomed in the yard, and it was an amazing sight.

These exceptional sword moves were attributed to Huang Xiaolong’s efforts and knowledge of using the Asura Sword Skill as the foundation; which he had then further developed through the combination of several technique manuals from the Ghost Buddha Depository, the Immortal Phoenix Palace, Barbarian God Sect, Golden Dragon Gate, as well as Fortune Gate, in combination with other sects’ sword techniques.

This new sword technique did not have anything fancy, but it enabled him to combine his knowledge about the law of water, fire, earth, metal, wood, wind, and lightning elements.

The blooming sword qi flowers in the yard suddenly crumbled into sword raindrops, falling to the ground. This rain gradually rose to a storm and a murderous aura filled the yard with rumbling thunder and streaks of lightning!

Lightning has a great destructive power and destruction was also the main intention of Huang Xiaolong’s new sword technique.

Huang Xiaolong circulated his godforce and the raindrops of sword qi suddenly expanded and exploded in the air. A myriad of sword qi resembling several radiant suns shot out in all directions.

Huang Xiaolong stopped after practicing his new sword technique after two hours and stood in the yard.

The new sword technique he had created was unpredictable and powerful, but it consumed a lot of godforce.

Huang Xiaolong took out several ancestor-grade divine pellets and threw them into his mouth all at once. Shortly after, he recovered ninety percent of his godforce.

“Looks like I will have to ask for Xiaoniū’s guidance for mastering the vitality of lightning element force.” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath. There were still several weaknesses to his new sword technique, and despite its powerful attacks and unpredictable changes, it lacked vitality.

Huang Xiaolong believed that sword technique shouldn’t just kill people, but it should also be able to save lives. Similarly, the little cow’s purple lightning not only contained a great destructive power, but it also contained the ability to birth vitality.

When Huang Xiaolong’s new sword technique would reach the point where it could save people’s lives, he would consider this as its minor completion.

"I say, Brother Huang, you finally came out." Footsteps sounded and in the next moment, a delighted Luo Yunjie walked into Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, "Perhaps there’s a good wine in this Golden Wheel City?"

"Indeed, there’s good wine here in the Golden Wheel City named Blood Wine.” Luo Yunjie laughed and went on, “Hearsay, they use water refined from the Blood Sea to make this wine and enhance it by adding blood grass, blood ganoderma and other precious herbs. But there is something more famous than Blood Wine in Golden Wheel City—golden beads!

“Golden beads?!” Huang Xiaolong looked at Luo Yunjie with confusion in his eyes.

Luo Yunjie nodded, “These golden beads are natural spiritual energy beads spit out by a special volcano not far from the outskirts of Golden Wheel City. Swallowing these golden beads not only raises one’s strength, but also tempers the physical body and strengthens the soul. Do you know why these golden beads attract cultivators from all around, throughout the seasons?

“They all come for the golden beads?” Huang Xiaolong asked in return.

Luo Yunjie grinned, “That’s right, the majority of them come for the golden beads, and luckily, the time of our arrival coincides with the period when the volcano will spit out these golden beads.”

“Are these golden beads useful to Ancestor God Realm cultivators?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“This is not the case.” Luo Yunjie shook his head. “It is only useful to those below the Ancestor God Realm, however, just the fact it could strengthen the soul is enough to have Ancestor God Realm cultivators flocking towards the volcano.”

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong and Luo Yunjie left the residence together, heading straight to this volcano.

In reality, the golden beads didn’t stir Huang Xiaolong’s interest hugely, but he was merely curious since these could strengthen the soul. Now that he had the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell, he didn’t feel any fervor towards these golden beads.

On the way, Luo Yunjie told Huang Xiaolong, “The volcano spits out golden beads only three to four days in a year, roughly ten thousand golden beads. Thus, most of the cultivators that find these golden beads use them for cultivation. You won’t be able to buy these golden beads even if you had money.”

It didn’t take Huang Xiaolong and Luo Yunjie long to arrive at the volcano area. When they arrived, Huang Xiaolong could see cultivators from various sects and families waiting, many of them were high-level Ancient God Realm masters.

The two of them chose a spacious area that was empty and waited like the other cultivators did.

Huang Xiaolong surveyed the surroundings with his divine sense. He discovered that both Zhou Xu and Tan Lin were there as well, along with Chen Kai and Sun Qiang. A moment later, Huang Xiaolong also found Li Lu and Wu Qian’er.

Needless to say, Huang Xiaolong was happy seeing Li Lu. Just as he was about to make his way over to them, the crowd stirred.

“People from the sea tribe are here!”

“It’s Guo Gang!”

“Every year when the volcano spits out the golden beads, anyone that finds two golden beads and above must give a payout of one golden bead to Guo Gang. He is bullying us to a great extent!”

“What can we do? His father is Guo Jin!”

Some human race cultivators complained amongst themselves with hatred.

Huang Xiaolong followed everyone’s gaze and saw a young man with icy blue hair and frosty blue eyes walking over with an arrogant gait. He had a group of sea tribe guards following behind him.
