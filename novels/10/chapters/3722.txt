Chapter 3723: Retrieving the Universe Source Stone

When the White Deer heard what White Feather King said, a wave of suspicion filled its heart. What the hell was he talking about? Why would Huang Xiaolong assist the Universe First Race in their quest to obtain the Universe Source Stone?! Is he someone from the Universe First Race?!

As questions raced through the White Deer’s mind, Huang Xiaolong continued to dig deeper towards the Universe Source Stone. After several days, he finally arrived.

Huang Xiaolong saw a separate space within the wall of Black Source Ice that contained the Universe Source Stone. It was the size of a fist with countless facets. Resplendent light was emitted from every single angle, and Huang Xiaolong felt as though it contained the power that fueled the universes.

Every single surface of the Universe Source Stone seemed to be a great world of its own! Huang Xiaolong felt the boundless power coursing through the stone.

Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Xiaolong tried to calm himself.

The Universe Source Stone had far surpassed any universe-level spiritual vein he knew. No matter how many top-grade universe-level spiritual veins he obtained, he would never be able to replicate the energy contained in the Universe Source Stone.

It was no wonder the Universe First Race wanted to use the Universe Source Stone as the eye of the formation. With the power contained in it, they would be truly able to activate the Extermination Formation! Only with the Universe Source Stone would they be able to destroy the Thirteen Universes and harvest all lives within!

Huang Xiaolong reached out slowly to grab the rock, but a wave of energy stopped him.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly. “Are you thinking of resisting me?”

A flash of light came from inside the Universe Source Stone as though it was challenging Huang Xiaolong.

He also felt like the Universe Source Stone was looking down on him.

Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter, “Even if you do not wish to follow me, you don’t have a choice! The Universe First Race was able to bring away your brother, and I’m more than capable of taking you with me today!”

Huang Xiaolong released his grand cosmos energy before reaching for the rock.

No matter how powerful the light it emitted, the Universe Source Stone realized that it wasn’t able to push Huang Xiaolong away! It could only watch as Huang Xiaolong’s hand arrived close to its surface. In a desperate attempt to stop Huang Xiaolong, it used everything it could, and Huang Xiaolong was forced to stop right before he could touch it.

Raising an eyebrow in surprise, Huang Xiaolong increased the amount of power he used once again. In response, the Universe Source Stone did the same.

As Huang Xiaolong increased his energy bit by bit, he was finally about to touch the Universe Source Stone when he released 29.9 billion units.

A tsunami of energy emerged from the Universe Source Stone, pushing Huang Xiaolong away.

Huang Xiaolong snickered when he realized that that was all the Universe Source Stone had. “I refuse to believe that you have much more left in you!”

As soon as he spoke, he circulated the Universe Transformation Art and 29.9999 billion units of grand cosmos energy flooded towards the rock.

Boom!

The moment he used his full power, the entire space started to shatter. The Universe Source Stone trembled where it stood.

The rays of light that came from the stone could no longer resist Huang Xiaolong, and he quickly grabbed the stone.

Tossing it into the third level of restrictions on the Universe Boat instantly, Huang Xiaolong suppressed it.

After he was done, he heaved a sigh of relief. When he returned, he would refine the Universe Source Stone slowly.

Huang Xiaolong used the Universe Origin Fires to cut a path towards the surface.

It was much faster when he left, and it took him less than a day.

When he emerged, he was greeted with the sight of the White Feather King.

Before the White Deer could say anything, the White Feather King spoke, “Huang Xiaolong, hand over the Universe Source Stone, and I’ll spare your life today!”

The White Deer was shocked.

It thought that Huang Xiaolong was in cahoots with the Universe First Race, but it seemed to be mistaken.

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he heard what the White Feather King said. “Spare my life? White Feather King, do you really think that you’re strong enough to determine my fate? I remember the Golden Cymbals King saying the exact same thing back in the Netherworld of the Unknown Space, but I’m still alive and kicking. Didn’t he flee with his tails tucked between his legs?”

“Golden Cymbals King? Hahaha, you must be mistaken. I’m no Golden Cymbals King!” The White Feather King looked at the White Deer and sneered, “Even if you work with this beast, you won’t be able to escape.”

As the words left his lips, he retrieved a Black Ghost Spike that the Black Nether King refined.

The Black Ghost Spike emitted dense rays of dark energy, and everyone could see how terrifying it was from a single glance. When they looked at it, they felt as though their souls were torn apart by horrifying beings.

The White Deer’s expression changed slightly.

“The Ghost Spike is refined by the Black Nether King in order to suppress the White Deer.” The White Feather King grinned. “White Deer, you better not interfere with the matter between my race and Huang Xiaolong. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind unleashing its full strength on you.”

A figure appeared beside the White Feather King when he spoke up to that point and in a state of shock, the White Feather King could only swing the spike out to protect himself.

Clang!

The Ghost Spike slammed into the wall that separated the White Deer Cave from the outside world and a punch landed on his chest. He was sent flying god knows how many miles away.

When he finally stabilized himself, he looked at his chest where a terrifying dent could be seen.

Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong in shock, he gasped, “You… How… How can you?!”

Yang Dingsheng was equally as stunned.

The White Feather King of the Universe First Race was sent flying by a single punch from Huang Xiaolong!

According to the information they had, wasn’t Huang Xiaolong, the master of the Blue Dragon Manor, someone with only 15 billion units of combat strength?!

“Are you curious as to my increase in strength?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “You can go back and ask the Golden Cymbals King when you return!”

Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred once again as he appeared before the White Feather King. His fist came crashing down.

A radiant staff appeared in the White Feather King’s hand and the power of radiance gushed out from it unceasingly.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

That was one of the thirteen universe treasures, the Radiant God Staff!

The Ghost Staff appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand as it countered the Radiant God Staff.

The White Feather King was forced to retreat once again.
