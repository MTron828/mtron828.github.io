Chapter 3729: Unescapable!

 

A feeling of rage filled its heart when it realized that someone was in its way. However, an awkward smile soon formed on the White Deer’s face when it saw that it was Huang Xiaolong’s arm.

“That…”

“I told you. I’m definitely going to grab that treasure,” Huang Xiaolong stated blandly.

“Do you really think that I’m afraid of you?!” The White Deer yelled.

“Well, I’m sure as hell not afraid of you,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Bouncing around with rage, the White Deer eventually chose to swallow its anger before negotiating with Huang Xiaolong for a part of the treasure.

After several tens of minutes, the two of them reached an agreement. Half of the petals would belong to the White Deer and the others would go to Huang Xiaolong. 

In order to obtain half the petals, the White Deer chose to work for Huang Xiaolong for a hundred million years.

Of course, it was only planning to work for Huang Xiaolong. Being a mount was out of the question.

When the two of them were negotiating, the experts all around broke out into discussion. However, none of them chose to make a move. After all, the Black Heart Old Ancestor’s fate was there for all of them to see. All of them saw how serious the old expert’s injury was. Even if he could use universe-level spiritual veins to recover, he would take several hundreds of millions of years.

It was extremely likely that he would never return to his peak level!

Eventually, Huang Xiaolong split the treasure with the White Deer.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong brought along the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng as they left.

The experts who were standing around only left reluctantly when Huang Xiaolong was nowhere to be seen.

“Lord, should we investigate that little brat’s identity?” someone in the Dazzling Black Race asked.

Cao Cheng nodded. “Find out if he’s really the owner of the Blue Dragon Manor!”

“What if he is?” 

A light flashed through Cao Cheng’s eyes.

After leaving the White Deer Cave, the three of them flew straight for the Fortune Space.

At the same time, the members of the Golden Phoenix Race were doing the same. They were in a sorry state as they flew back all by themselves.

When the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince thought of Huang Xiaolong, anger filled his heart. He turned to an expert beside him and growled, “Doesn’t Yang Dingsheng have a son?” 

“Your Highness, do you mean…” 

“Capture him right now!” The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince snapped, “Cut off a piece of his flesh every day. I’ll torture him to the end of time when I return!” 

“As for Huang Xiaolong, go investigate his identity! If he really is the owner of the Blue Dragon Manor, get someone to kill everyone in there!” 

The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince passed down several orders instantly.

He never suffered such humiliation before.

“What if Huang Xiaolong finds out? Wouldn’t he…” Huang Ruocheng asked.

A snort left the crown prince’s lips. “So what if he does? When I return to the Fortune Space, he won’t be able to do anything to me! Does he dare to pick a fight with our Golden Phoenix Mountain? Humph! He’s asking for death if he dares to come!” 

The old ancestor of the Golden Phoenix Race was the third strongest expert in the Fortune Space! He was an existence whose combat strength crossed the 29 billion mark!

…

After leaving the White Deer Cave, Huang Xiaolong was too annoyed by their slow flying speed, and he quickly brought out the Universe Boat.

The White Deer and Yang Dingsheng stared at him in disbelief when they saw the ranked-number-one universe treasure.

A complicated gaze formed on the White Deer’s face.

Ignoring the animal, Huang Xiaolong entered the third layer of formations and brought out his portion of the White Flower. Plucking off a single petal, he tossed it into the eye of the formation.

Sitting down, he circulated the Universe Transformation Art to devour the universe source qi.

After several moments, Huang Xiaolong realized how much better the quality of universe source qi was! The qi produced from the petal of the White Flower allowed him to comprehend the mysteries of the universe at a faster rate compared to the past!

The treasure really came at the right time!

Excitement filled his heart. 

With the universe source qi produced from the petals of the White Flower, Huang Xiaolong felt that he could enter the half-step Universe God Realm in less than a hundred thousand years!

Now, the Universe First Race was several hundred thousand years away from activating their Extermination Formation. He could definitely break through before they tried anything!

When that happened, he wouldn’t even be afraid of the Black Nether King!

The White Deer and Yang Dingsheng cultivated quietly on the ship. As they were unable to enter the grand formation, they couldn’t see Huang Xiaolong’s situation.

All of a sudden, Yang Dingsheng’s transmission symbol buzzed, and his expression turned ugly to the extreme after he read the contents.

“What’s wrong?” The White Deer asked.

“Lord White Deer…” Yang Dingsheng fell to his knees and bawled, “I received a report from one of my trusted friends from the race! He said that the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince ordered for my son’s arrest! He plans to cut off his flesh every single day and the old ancestor of my race doesn’t dare to say anything about it! Lord White Deer, please save my son!” 

The White Deer was stunned for a second, but a sneer soon formed on its lips. “That dumb*ss dares to ignore Lord Huang’s order… He’s definitely tired of living.” 

Helping Yang Dingsheng up, it continued, “You’re Lord Huang’s friend. Not to worry, I promise to get your son out!” 

Yang Dingsheng thanked the White Deer profusely.

Several months later…L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the Fortune Space and he emerged from the third layer of formations. That was when he learned that the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince captured Yang Dingsheng’s son. His expression sank.

“Do you know where your son is held?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“He’s currently in the Lion King City in the Central Plains!” 

“That’s where we’re going then.” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he steered the ship towards the Central Plains.

A month later, they arrived.

“I heard that the second piece of Universe Source Stone has appeared! It should be in the hands of someone called Huang Xiaolong!”

“The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince ordered for Yang Dingsheng’s son’s arrest. Now, he’s held in Lion King City in order to draw Huang Xiaolong out. Nearly all the patriarchs have surrounded the city in wait for Huang Xiaolong!” 

It didn’t take long before Huang Xiaolong overheard their secret voice transmissions.
