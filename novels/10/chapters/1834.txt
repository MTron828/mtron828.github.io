When Huang Xiaolong looked at Wu Jingnan roaring with laughter, an indifferent expression hung on his face.

After a full minute, Wu Jingnan’s laughter finally died down. However, a smile remained on his face, and he looked extremely amused.

Before anyone could react, the expression on Wu Jingnan’s face changed in an instant. His smile froze, and a frosty look appeared on his face. Killing intent burst out of him, and he glared at Gao Changran. “Gao Changran, I was planning to let your Six Nether Gate live for a few more days. I had planned on taking care of you after Lord Archdevil Ancestor came. I had never thought that you would be stupid enough to run all the way here to spout your b*llshit in front of me! Right now, I am unhappy... I am extremely unhappy!”

“As such, I have decided to destroy you!”

He pointed at Huang Xiaolong, and his eyes turned completely bloodshot. “This little b*stard will die as well. I will let him die a horrible death, and after killing the two of you, I will head over to your headquarters. I have heard that your daughter is rather pretty. I can allow her to live for a few more years after she agrees to be my slave...”

The killing intent in Wu Jingnan’s heart rose to the extreme.

Huang Xiaolong had managed to trigger him this time.

He had initially thought about killing off the Six Nether Gate’s disciples and teaching them a small lesson after tens of thousands of them died. After his father and the Archdevil Ancestor’s arrival, he was going to allow Gao Changran to live if he were to submit to the Devil Ape Cult.

When his words entered Gao Changran’s ears, Gao Changran glared at him. It was too bad he didn’t dare to move without Huang Xiaolong’s order.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Wu Jingnan, and he shook his head slowly. “I never wanted to blow things up. Since you refuse to take the chance given to you, I have no choice. You know what, I’ll give you one final chance. If you manage to take a strike from me without dying, I will consider not wiping you guys out.”

Wu Jingnan erupted with laughter once again, and his figure started to blur. When he reappeared, he had already arrived before Huang Xiaolong. He sent out a punch without holding anything back. “There’s no need for a single move. If you manage to block half a move from me, I’ll spare your life!”

He was an early-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch, and his fist contained all the power he could muster.

Moreover, he was using the Devil Ape Cult’s divine skill, the Devil Ape Heaven Shaking Fist.

The might of a single fist was enough to shake the heavens and earth.

As the devil qi fluctuated around his fist, it seemed as though a Devil Ape had awakened in him. A terrifying might surged out of his body towards Huang Xiaolong.

His fist broke the space around it, and it emitted a high pitched whistle as it shot towards Huang Xiaolong. With the strength to topple mountains and overturn seas, it seemed as though it would destroy anything in its path! If God blocked it, he would kill God. If Buddha stood in his way, he would exterminate Buddha!

Li Tong and Tian Changyue didn’t bother stopping him. They locked on to Gao Changran and made their move.

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the fist coming his way, he chuckled. He raised his arm and returned the favor.

Without even circulating his godforce and Archdevil bloodlines, Huang Xiaolong relied completely on the might of the True Dragon Physique.

Boom!

The air around them seemed to explode, and all the structures around them collapsed. The buildings made from stone and special materials turned into tofu in the face of the shockwave produced from the blow between them. Everything was reduced to a pile of dust.

As for Wu Jingnan, he was sent flying like a dead dog. After blasting through god knew how many structures, he finally stopped when he smashed into a massive pillar. The pillar failed to withstand the impact and came crashing down on him.

“WHAT?!”

Li Tong, Tian Changyue, and the other ancestors, who were about to make a move on Gao Changran, felt their minds going blank.

“Young master!”

They finally reacted after some time, and all of them rushed over to Wu Jingnan. They sent the pillar flying with a single strike, and they supported Wu Jingnan out of the rubble.

The armor on his body was shattered beyond repair, and blood seemed to burst out from every single part of his body. He was like a glass-plane on the verge of shattering. The aura of life in him had already dimmed, and his arm had turned into a pile of mangled flesh.

Everyone who looked at him sucked in a cold breath, and they felt their hearts shaking in terror.

However, they didn’t have the luxury of time to be shocked. They had to save Wu Jingnan before it was too late.

After their initial fluster, Wu Jingnan slowly opened his eyes.

All the ancestors heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Wu Jingnan returning to his senses. If something were to happen to him under their care, they wouldn’t be able to give a proper explanation upon their Archdevil Ancestor’s arrival.

Li Tong, Tian Changyue, and the rest turned around and stared at Huang Xiaolong gloomily.

“Who are you?” Li Tong glared at Huang Xiaolong, and all of them released their aura to lock him in place. Even though they looked calm, waves crashed around in their hearts.

As the young master of the Devil Ape Cult and an early-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch, Wu Jingnan had the combat strength of someone at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. Not to mention the fact that he possessed heaven-defying talent.

However, before them, the black-haired man had managed to beat Wu Jingnan to an inch of his life using a single punch!

Someone at the Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm actually had the combat strength of a First Order Emperor! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This... Even the word ‘horrifying’ wasn’t enough to describe Huang Xiaolong.

“You don’t need to know who I am.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head once again and continued, “There’s no difference whether you know about my identity or not.”

Tian Changyue’s expression sank. “What do you mean? Brat, you better reply obediently when I ask you a question. Do you believe that I will not tear out all the bones in your body one by one?”

“No, I don’t.”

“Since that is the case, I will show you right now! I want to see if Gao Changran can stop me!” As soon as he said that, Tian Changyue sent a slap towards Huang Xiaolong.

The energy contained in his palm had the might of a multitude of chaos mountains. Before his palm arrived, the ground around Huang Xiaolong started to crack and shatter.

That was the Devil Ape Cult’s Earth-Shattering Divine Palm! It was able to shatter anything in its path.

Gao Changran’s face changed, but before he could make a move, another giant palm appeared behind Huang Xiaolong. It received the attack from Tian Changyue. The power of withering wood immediately shattered the blow from Tian Changyue, but that wasn’t all. It broke through space itself and landed on Tian Changyue’s chest.

In an instant, Tian Changyue’s chest burst open, and he drew a beautiful arc in the sky.

The sudden change in the situation caused Li Tong and the others to stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock. They turned to look at the source of the counterattack and realized that they had failed to detect that someone had already appeared behind Huang Xiaolong. The figure hid his aura, and it seemed like he was an ordinary man. However, his presence alone caused Li Tong and the rest to feel suffocating pressure.

The feeling they got was the same as when they stood before the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor!

They felt as though a bomb had gone off in their head. How is this possible? Lord Archdevil Ancestor is at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. Even experts at the early-First Order Sovereign Realm wouldn’t be able to kill Lord Archdevil Ancestor... How can the person behind the little brat possess comparable strength to Lord Archdevil Ancestor?!

Of course, the palm that had appeared from behind Huang Xiaolong belonged to one of the four odd beasts. It had merely made a move in its human form.

Despite that, the human form beast had more than enough strength to cause Li Tong and the rest to wet their pants.
