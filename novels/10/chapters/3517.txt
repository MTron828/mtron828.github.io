Chapter 3518: Meeting Ao Guang Again

 

Eventually, he decided against it.

When he was completely destroyed by the little brat’s parents in the past, he had carved that memory into his mind. He never wanted to enter the Dragon’s Impasse ever again.

Of course, he didn’t leave either. Instead, he entered the void to wait for Huang Xiaolong once again.

He believed that Huang Xiaolong would definitely emerge from the Dragon’s Impasse, and it wouldn’t take too long.

Several dozen years passed in an instant.

One day, when Yu Long was waiting for Huang Xiaolong to leave the Dragon’s Impasse, a figure appeared.

Joy flashed through Yu Long’s heart when he realized that Huang Xiaolong was finally out.

Right before Yu Long could do a thing, three other figures appeared behind him. 

The happiness he felt disappeared in an instant, and his soul froze. Terror clouded his eyes and he didn’t bother staring at them for another second before he turned tail to run.

A couple, along with a little dragon appeared behind Huang Xiaolong.

The couple was clad in robes that emitted pretty starlight, and the universe trembled when they moved.

“That little brat ran really quickly…” The middle-aged man chuckled lightly when he noticed Yu Long’s departure.

“Of course he did. Did you forget what you did to him?” His wife suppressed a smile as she chided him.

The two of them laughed happily in response.

“Big Brother, Sister-in-law, I’ll have to trouble you with Chu Huaihao.” Huang Xiaolong joined in the laughter.

The two of them were the little dragon’s parents, and the man was called Ao Xing! As for his mother, she was called Ao Meixia.

The relationship between them was a long story.

“It’s nothing. Xiaolong, you don’t have to worry about us.” Ao Xing smiled. “I believe that Xu Long will choose to show us some respect.”

“Also, we have to thank you.” Ao Meixia continued, “That’s right, Xiaolong, there’s no need to worry about Xu Long. After all, we’ll need some help when you enter the grand completion stage in the future.”

The little dragon interrupted, “Enough, enough! There’s no need for all these formalities! Big Brother, do you think there’re delicacies in the Bearded Dragon World?”

Ao Xing frowned. “Brat, call him uncle.” 

“But I like calling him big brother!” The little dragon pouted.

With his eyes widening slightly, Ao Xing stared at his child.

“Alright, alright, let him call Xiaolong whatever he wants.” Ao Meixia giggled. “We’ll address him how we like, and the kid can do what he wants.”

“Sister-in-law is right,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. He turned to the little dragon and continued, “There’s a ton of great food in the Bearded Dragon World, and I’ll bring you around when we get there!”

“Yay!” The little dragon clapped his hands in celebration.

When they were chatting happily, Yu Long finally stopped after running god knows how far. His chest heaved up and down, and even so, he quickly looked behind him with fear clouding his eyes. He was afraid that Ao Xing would hunt him down.

The fear he had for Ao Xing had already surpassed anything one could imagine.

It affected him straight down to his bones.

He only managed to calm himself after a long time.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When his mind finally settled, many questions appeared in his head. He couldn’t understand why Ao Xing and his wife would follow behind Huang Xiaolong to leave the Dragon’s Impasse. Could Huang Xiaolong have convinced them?! Or could it be because of the little dragon?!

From what Yu Long knew, the couple never meddled in affairs regarding the Star Dragon Universe.

Now that they were finally emerging from the Dragon’s Impasse, the universe would be thrown into a state of chaos!

Half a day later…

Huang Xiaolong and three others appeared above the Bearded Dragon World.

“The Bearded Dragon World is so lively!” The little dragon looked at the countless flying ships and gasped in shock. “Big Brother, are you going to bring me around now?!”

“Alright!”

However, Ao Xing quickly stepped in. “Starly, don’t mess about. Your Uncle Xiaolong and I came here to do something important.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his hands and laughed, “Brother Ao, there’s no need to worry. Whatever the case, Chu Huaihao won’t be able to escape. We’ll deal with him after getting some food.”

“Hehe! I knew that Big Brother was the best!” The little dragon grinned at his father.

“Xiaolong, you’ll spoil the little brat… Look at him now. He’s getting more mischievous by the day!” 

Huang Xiaolong smiled in response. “It’s alright. He’s just a child.”

A smug grin appeared on the little dragon’s face when he turned to look at his father.

Faced with the little brat, Ao Xing could only reveal a helpless smile.

“That’s the Zhao Long Holy World in front of us. I’ve heard that the Fire Bugs there are pretty famous in the Bearded Dragon World,” Huang Xiaolong introduced.

“Fire Bugs?” Ao Meixia raised an eyebrow in surprise.

“They’re bred with a special method by the Hundred Fragrance Pavilion. It’s said that a single bug will take several dozen years to mature, and one needs more than a million dao coins to nurture them. As such, they are extremely hard to come by. A single Fire Bug costs two million dao coins. Even so, there’re many people dying for a taste of it. There’s never enough to go around!” Huang Xiaolong explained.

“The meat of the Fire Bug is extremely tender, and it contains fire spiritual qi. A single bite can soothe one’s dao soul.”

“Oh?” Ao Xing was intrigued, and he chuckled, “Then let’s go have a taste.”

Ao Meixia added a question all of a sudden. “Is the Hundred Fragrance Pavilion owned by the Bearded Dragon World?”

“Nope. It’s from the White Dragon Race.”

“Oh? It belongs to that little brat Ao Cheng!” Ao Xing nodded.

The old ancestor of the White Dragon Race once entered the Dragon’s Impasse, and Ao Xing was no stranger to the man.

Soon after, all four of them entered the Hundred Fragrance Pavilion.

When they arrived, the entire pavilion was full, and hundreds of people were waiting outside for a spot in the restaurant.

Ao Xing stared at them in shock. “Are they all here to eat Fire Bugs?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded his head. “That’s right. The Hundred Fragrance Pavilion has a rule that only customers who wish to order their Fire Bugs will be able to get a spot in the restaurant.”

“Looks like there are many rich people in the Bearded Dragon World…” Ao Meixia laughed.

There was no way they could be poor if they could spend millions on Fire Bugs.

Huang Xiaolong smiled in response. 

“What do we do now? Are we going to join the queue?” Ao Xing chuckled. “I don’t think I’ve ever queued for anything.”

Before Huang Xiaolong could reply, a commotion broke out in the crowd.

“It’s the second prince! Second Prince Ao Guang is here!”

“Second Prince Ao Guang graces the Hundred Fragrance Pavilion!”

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the group of newcomers, and the corners of his lips slowly curled upwards. He saw hundreds of experts following behind Ao Guang as they walked towards the pavilion.

With his head held high, Ao Guang was about to walk into the entrance when he noticed a familiar face. With his eyes widening in shock, his expression sank. “Huang… Huang Xiaolong?!”

He never expected to meet Huang Xiaolong in the Zhao Long World.

Sweeping his gaze all around, he tried to see if there was anyone else present. After all, he knew that Wang Meiqi was an existence nearing the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.

“There’s no need to look. Meiqi isn’t here,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.
