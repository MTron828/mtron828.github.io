’What is this feeling?’ The scene from the past, when he was being chased by an ancient magic beast flickered in his mind.

That’s right, the feeling of being preyed on by an ancient magical beast!

Goosebumps ran down Lin Bi’s neck. His sword slashed a path to the surface of the water and he fled from the seabed. He heaved a sigh of relief, the moment he got far away from the sea surface.

This feeling of escaping death made Lin Bi break out in cold sweat.

Lin Bi took another glance at the blood-red sea below him, and then sped away, no longer caring about Huang Xiaolong and the little cow. In his opinion, both Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were heavily injured by his sword qi, and even if they survived, they would be wasted.

Not long after Lin Bi left, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow gradually came to their consciousness inside someplace on the seabed.

Huang Xiaolong slowly opened his eyes. He felt an extreme weakness in his whole body that he had not felt in a long time, and even lifting a finger was strenuous.

He reverted to his human form and was slightly alarmed as there was no reaction from the four divine fires. Fortunately, the purple grandmist aura dragon and the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell were glowing softly, albeit dimmer than usual.

His three supreme godheads were barely spinning, but they had lost much of their radiance.

Huang Xiaolong was unable to sense the little cow’s condition, while he was stuck to lying down on the ground for the moment. But it seemed like their situation was more or less the same—they were conscious and alive! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Roughly an hour had passed, when Huang Xiaolong could finally exert some strength as he struggled to a sitting position, as his True Dragon Physique’s Instant Recovery ability had mended his injuries.

Enduring sharp pains all over his body, Huang Xiaolong circulated his little godforce according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. Immediately, rich spiritual energy rushed towards him from the surroundings, which started nourishing and mending him.

Three days passed, while Huang Xiaolong maintained this posture. About sixty percent of his injuries were healed within these three days, and at this rate, he would fully recover in another seven days.

Huang Xiaolong stopped running the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. He got up and looked at the little cow; purple lightning was enshrouding the little cow, which clearly meant that she was still healing.

Although the little cow’s injuries were healing at an amazing speed, it was slower compared to Huang Xiaolong’s Instant Recovery.

Huang Xiaolong clenched his fists as he breathed out foul qi. The injuries this time were the gravest he had ever suffered since he had ascended to the Divine World.

Had it been some average Tenth Order Ancient God Realm cultivators, they would’ve probably died ten times or more, if they would have gotten chased to the same extent as him and the little.

Huang Xiaolong took some time to survey their location. He found himself inside a great hall, and the four walls around him reflected in the ripples of water. It was made of materials that he couldn’t name. However, the great hall reminded him of the underwater Dragon Palace.

Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense spread outwards but to his astonishment, he was met with a resistance that constricted his divine sense within the great hall.

Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment, but then he stepped deeper inside the great hall. At the other end of it, he came across two tunnels.

Brimming vitality rushed out from the tunnel on the left side, whereas an overwhelming death qi and devil qi rushed out from the tunnel on his right.

He frowned as he sensed vitality as well as death qi from these two separate tunnels. After some thought, he decided to go through the tunnel on the right where death qi and devil qi were flowing out.

The tunnel was so dark that as soon as Huang Xiaolong stepped inside it, he couldn’t even see his own fingers. Even after Huang Xiaolong opened his Eye of Hell, he could barely see ten meters in front of him.

He started walking very cautiously inside this tunnel.

The tunnel was longer than Huang Xiaolong had expected. He walked for almost two hours before he could see the exit.

Huang Xiaolong closed his eyes as he stepped out from the tunnel, as the glaring lights hit his eyes. Moments later, he finally saw what was at the end of the tunnel as he opened his eyes.

In front of him was an enormous square!

And right at the center of this square were eight giant stone pillars with various ancient symbols carved on their surfaces. There was a big bright sphere at the top every stone pillar that was quivering continuously, sending out ripples of some mysterious force.

These ripples of the mysterious force from the eight light spheres were connected as they formed a light shield that covered all eight stone pillars. Under the light shield was an enormous magical beast with a horn, a tail, and a cute face!

Corrosive devil qi was flowing out from this magic beast’s body.

Huang Xiaolong immediately discovered that the corrosive devil qi flowing out from this magic beast was many times thicker than the outside corrosive devil qi.

‘The void devil beast?’ A thought flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Suddenly, the void devil beast sealed within the stone pillars’ space opened its eyes—its pupils were the color of extreme icy blue. As the void devil beast opened its eyes, the entire Devil Prison Mountain’s corrosive devil qi roiled for a brief second.

After opening its eyes, the void devil beast was obviously surprised to see Huang Xiaolong. After a long time of several million years, did a human manage to actually get here?

“You are the imprisoned void devil beast, aren’t you?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The void devil beast’s eyes widened slightly in surprise. It looked at Huang Xiaolong and rose to its full height, then said, “I can’t imagine that someone still remembers me after such a long time!” The pressure it exuded caused the light shield to tremble.

A light glinted in its icy blue eyes as if it wanted to see through Huang Xiaolong.

“Ei!” It exclaimed in amazement, “True Dragon Physique?!’ Then it shook its head, “Cannot be, the True Dragon Physique cannot be so strong, a variant physique?”

Just as the void devil beast’s gaze shifted to the space of Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness, it retreated hastily as if it had run into a terrifying giant.

“You—you actually have a defensive divine artifact in your soul?!”

“Top grade chaos spiritual artifact?”

Although the void devil beast could see Huang Xiaolong had a soul defensive divine artifact, it did not know about the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell. Therefore, it could simply guess that it was a chaos spiritual artifact.

Huang Xiaolong did not bother to explain anything to the void devil beast. His gaze turned towards the eight stone pillars instead, as he started studying the ancient symbols on them.

“These are the ancient Burning Purgatory Magical symbols.” At this time, a voice sounded from behind Huang Xiaolong. The little cow had passed through the dark tunnel and had arrived at the square.

“Yo-you know about these burning purgatory magical symbols?!” The void devil beast was flabbergasted as it looked at the little cow. In the whole Divine World, there were only a handful of people that could recognize the Burning Purgatory Magical symbols, and this little cow was one of them?!

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had already restored their original forms.

The little cow rolled her eyes at the void devil beast and said, “I also can tell this Burning Purgatory Magical Formation was arranged by old monster Qing.”

The void devil beast shook with excitement as it asked, “Then, then, do you know how to break this ancient Burning Purgatory Magical Formation?!” It stared fixedly at the little cow.

“Correct!” The little cow nodded.

“You!” The void devil beast’s body shook even harder when it heard that the little could break the Burning Purgatory Magical Formation, which was trapping him.

“Little Azure Cow, what do you want, just tell me! As long as you free me from this ancient Burning Purgatory Magical Formation, I’ll give anything to you!” The void devil beast’s words began to sound incoherent due to excitement.

It had been waiting for this day to retain its freedom, since several hundred million years.

Little Azure Cow? Huang Xiaolong shook his head and smiled inwardly, as he heard the void devil beast address the little cow as Little Azure Cow. Looks like this void devil beast has taken the little cow for granted to be an Ancient God Realm junior...
