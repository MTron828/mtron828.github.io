Chapter 3367: Path to the Immortal World

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong entered the Central Star System, the patriarchs received news of him breaking through the formation.

“What?! How in the world did the Nine Rainbow Immortal Gate shatter?!” Han Li gasped.

That was basically the reaction of those present.

How could something as absurd as that happen?!

It was absolutely absurd!

“Could the Nine Rainbow Immortal Gate be worn out after the years of existence?” Ning Qiyu muttered.

Everyone looked at each other awkwardly.

“Perhaps…” Yuan Hong frowned. Other than that, he couldn’t think of another reason.

“From the reports from the various disciples, Huang Xiaolong and the little black spirit seem to be heading towards the path to the Immortal World!” Jiang Lin said.

“Path to the Immortal World? Is he planning on crossing the tribulation to ascend to the Immortal World?” Ning Qiyu guessed.

“No! We cannot allow him to ascend! Tell everyone that they have to delay the two of them no matter the cost!”

As such, everyone started passing down orders to their subordinates hastily.

One hour later…

Huang Xiaolong and Liu Huang stood in the middle of space as they looked at a weirdly shaped tunnel before them.

“Is this the path to the Immortal World?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Yes. When you arrive at the end of the tunnel, you’ll enter the Immortal World. However, it has been sealed off by the great immortals, and they left behind countless restrictions along the way. The further down the tunnel you go, the stronger the restrictions!” Liu Huang explained, “Not even peak late-Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm experts would be able to cross a tenth of the tunnel!”

“Moreover, the immortal palace is right in front of us. We need to obtain permission from the Immortal Palace if we wish to enter the tunnel. Otherwise, they’ll kill anyone who dares to try!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly.

The Immortal Palace is a tiny faction established by the Heavenly Court. They convey the will of the Heavenly Court and anyone who refuses to listen to them will be going against the Immortal World!

When Huang Xiaolong and Liu Huang were observing the tunnel, a whole new group arrived.

It was the patriarchs of the immortal factions.

There weren't too many of them, and there were ninety-nine experts in total.

Moreover, all of them were experts in the Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm.

A flash of cold light crossed Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Throughout their journey, they were intercepted more than thirty times!

Liu Huang became annoyed, and he started killing those from the immortal faction. Even though he eliminated more than ten thousand of them, they didn’t give up!

“That’s them!” Han Li pointed at Huang Xiaolong and yelled.

Seeing as they hadn’t entered the path to the Immortal World, Yang Hong and the others heaved a sigh of relief. If Huang Xiaolong were to enter the Immortal World, things would be troublesome. After all, not even people like them would be able to enter the tunnel without permission from the Immortal Palace.

They surrounded Huang Xiaolong and Liu Huang with many others guarding the tunnel.

“Are you the new devil lord of Devil Hell?!” Jiang Lin glared at Huang Xiaolong as killing intent emerged from his body.

During the war against Devil Hell countless years ago, almost half of the experts who died at the hands of devils came from the Hundred Buddha Immortal Gate!

Huang Xiaolong ignored Jiang Lin as he swept his gaze across the others.

“I can give you one final chance if you kneel and submit to me.”

They stared at Huang Xiaolong like he was a mad man.

However, Jiang Lin soon roared with laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, no matter how strong you are, you won’t be a match for all of us! Stop embarrassing yourself right before you die!”

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong dragged him over by the neck the moment the words left his lips.

Yuan Hong and the others felt their jaws dropping in fright.

Jiang Lin was an expert at the peak of the Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm! He had the Ancient Golden Buddha Physique, and his combat strength was terrifying! He was only slightly weaker than Yuan Hong, but he was easily captured by Huang Xiaolong!

Losing all strength in his body, Jiang Lin stuttered, “You… You… You’re not a Void Immortal!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

How else could the other party deal with him so easily?

Could Huang Xiaolong actually be a Heavenly Immortal?

There was no way! A Heavenly Immortal couldn’t exist in the Mortal World! They had to ascend the moment they crossed the tribulation!

Yuan Hong and the others were flabbergasted by his revelation!

All of a sudden, a group of experts flew over from the path to the Immortal World.

“Senior?!” someone yelled in surprise.

When Yuan Hong and the others turned to look at the newcomer, they discovered that it was Ye Zhaolong of the Panwu Immortal Gate! There were experts from the Immortal Palace with him.

The person who spoke was Ye Zhaolong, the expert Huang Xiaolong found after he entered the Mortal World.

Their hearts thumped when they heard how Ye Zhaolong addressed Huang Xiaolong.

Did he know who the new devil lord was?!

When Yuan Hong and the others were still confused, Ye Zhaolong ran over to Huang Xiaolong and kneeled on the ground. “Ye Zhaolong greets the great senior. I didn’t think that I would be able to meet you again after our fateful encounter in the past.”

Huang Xiaolong had located him after entering the Silver Star System of the Pangu World, and he even had imparted a set of techniques to the man.

“Patriarch Ye, do you know what you’re doing right now?!” Yuan Hong snorted in anger. “Senior?! He’s the new devil lord of the generation! As the leader of the immortal factions, you dare kneel before a devil?!”

“What?! He’s the new devil lord?!” Ye Zhaolong gasped in shock. He didn’t think that it was possible.

“Oh? Patriarch Yuan, is he really the new devil lord?” Liu Bing, the Palace Master of the Immortal Palace frowned.

The reason behind their emergence was to look for a certain treasure. They didn’t think that they would run into something like that.

As the palace master, he definitely knew about the Devil Hell.

“Yes, Lord Liu Bing,” Yuan Hong replied respectfully. “He’s called Huang Xiaolong and he’s the new devil lord! It has barely been an hour since he entered the Central Star System, but he killed more than ten thousand experts of our immortal factions! He’s even more violent than the old devil lord! Moreover, his strength surpasses anything we understand! Lord Liu Bing, please take action and kill this murderer!”

Killed more than ten thousand experts of the immortal factions.

The experts of the Immortal Palace were surprised as they looked at Huang Xiaolong who was holding Jiang Lin in his hand.

A snort left Liu Bing’s lips. “Release Patriarch Jiang Lin immediately!”
