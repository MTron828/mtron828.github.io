Chapter 3578 – Limitless Continent

“My Sword Dao Gate will remember this!” Xu Qi growled before turning around to leave.

“Did I tell you to leave?” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

Xu Qi and the others turned around, flabbergasted.

“Haha, what do you think you’re doing? Do you really think you’re capable enough to capture all of us? Are you planning to kill us all?”

He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would be crazy enough to touch the disciples of the Sword Dao Gate, much less the direct disciple of the patriarch!

The moment the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong stomped once on the ground below him. The city trembled violently, and the skies seemed to crumble before their very eyes. In an instant, Xu Qi and the experts of the Sword Dao Gate exploded into a mist of blood.

The disciples of the Zhang Family met the same fate. The only exception was Zhang Shaohuang, and Huang Xiaolong left him alive on purpose. Even though he managed to keep his life, his meridians were completely shattered and his Saint Fate was destroyed. As he crashed into one of the walls surrounding them, he stared at Huang Xiaolong in fear.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Tao Hang and Tao Han’er who were staring at the nasty scene before them. Hugging Tao Han’er, he laughed, “Han’er, are you afraid?”

“No I’m not!” Tao Han’er shook her head resolutely. “They are really bad people!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.

When Huang Xiaolong left the scene, the Falling Water City was thrown into complete chaos. If the sword qi summoned by the core disciple shocked the experts in the city, Huang Xiaolong’s stomp was a hundred times more terrifying! They fell to their knees in fright.

The old ancestor of the Zhang Family was in his secret chamber, cultivating, when he plopped to his knees in fear. Gasping for breath, he panicked, “I wonder which expert at the Dao Venerable Realm paid a visit to our city…”

After everything calmed down, he rushed out of his secret chamber to order the patriarch of the Zhang Family to investigate everything that happened.

It didn’t take long before the patriarch dragged Zhang Shaohuang back.

“You.. What?! What did you say?! Xu Qi was killed by someone? Dozens of core disciples of the Sword Dao Gate were killed along with him?!” The old ancestor of the Zhang Family felt the world spinning around him.

The patriarch of the Zhang Family was similarly terrified.

When Huang Xiaolong returned to the newly bought manor, Tao Hang used the tablet to control the formation protecting the residence.

Walking around the entire manor, they discovered that it was hundreds of acres large. There were lots of natural structures, and it was something extravagant in the eyes of ordinary Primal Ancestors. However, the residence was comparable to trash in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Ignoring the small details, Huang Xiaolong knew that he was only going to stay there for a period of time. Nothing else was as important as locating the Universe Boat. Deciding to settle down for a period of time, Huang Xiaolong continued to search for the strongest universe treasure in the thirteen universes!

As there were many rooms in the manor, Huang Xiaolong allowed Tao Hang and Tao Han’er to choose one for themselves. When everyone had settled in, he summoned Tao Hang to the main hall to inquire about the matters regarding the Unknown Lands.

Tao Hang might be a True Saint, but he traveled to a lot of places in his life. He was extremely knowledgeable about various regions in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire.

Huang Xiaolong discovered that unlike the various universes, the Unknown Lands was made up of various continents. Not a single great world was contained within, and they were currently situated in a region called the Limitless Continent. Tao Hang had no idea how many celestial empires there were on the Limitless Continent, but he knew that the old ancestor of the Golden Sea Continent was called Jin Hai, and he was a God of Creation at the large completion stage.

The Golden Sea Celestial Empire managed countless cities, and the Falling Water City was one of them.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong gained a better understanding about the Unknown Lands.

Tao Hang might not know much, but Huang Xiaolong managed to extrapolate the information he obtained. It seemed as though the large continents were created by the supreme experts who managed to transcend the destruction of the thirteen universes.

Every single continent was the territory of one of the overlords!

As for the celestial empires, they were all under the control of a single entity!

“Are there any forbidden areas around the Golden Sea Celestial Empire?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

Tao Hang had no idea what Huang Xiaolong’s intention was, but he replied all the same. “Yes. Tehre is a place called the Sentient Mountain Range located in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. It’s a place where ferocious beasts thrive. It’s the most dangerous region in the celestial empire, and the mountain range stretches across ninety percent of the region!”

“It has been a place where the various factions would send their disciples to undergo life or death training. I heard that the crown prince of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire would frequently go there to train! The princess would do the same!”

“However, they would only dare to remain on the outskirts of the mountain range. Ferocious beasts comparable to Dao Venerables who comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level stay in the depths of the Sentient Mountain Range!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and he asked about the location of the mountain range. Getting Tao Hang to stand back, Huang Xiaolong tore through space.

Several minutes later, he returned with five beasts beside him.

Tao Hang stared at Huang Xiaolong as a strange look formed on his face. Could the five beasts he brought back be… There was no way… They had to be ordinary beasts Huang Xiaolong caught on a whim.

His guess was on point. Huang Xiaolong took a trip over to the Sentient Mountain Range and captured all five beasts kings. Their strength was comparable to Gu Yuan and Long Yi back in the First Universe before they ascended to the God of Creation Realm.

As Zhu Qiming and the others had some sort of restriction in their bodies, Huang Xiaolong was unable to control them as he wished. He could only choose the next best option. With the five beast kings, he wouldn’t have to dirty his hands every time he wanted to do something.

It was too bad he failed to find any beasts at the God of Creation level.

From their memories, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Sentient Mountain Range had two beasts comparable to Gods of Creation. However, they went to the Land of Death and were nowhere to be seen.

In the following month, Huang Xiaolong went out with three beast kings, Tao Hang, and Tao Han’er everyday to scour the markets. The two other beast kings were left behind to guard the manor.

Even after a month, there was no clue on the location of the Universe Boat.

As night fell…

Huang Xiaolong looked at the stars twinkling in the skies and he sighed. The stars seemed to be a little brighter than those in the thirteen universes. Even so, his mind was stuck on the Universe Boat.

He looked through every corner of the city, only to be disappointed time and time again. Could the Universe Boat be located outside the city? Perhaps, it was located in the surrounding regions.

Retrieving the Universe Sphere, Huang Xiaolong looked at the faint glow surrounding it. Despite his actions, he failed to receive any reaction from it.

A moment later, he retrieved the Universe Sphere and muttered, “I wonder if there are any antique shops or marketplaces in the city…”
