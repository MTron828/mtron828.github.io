Chapter 491: Let You Live A Few More Days

Lei Hua was sitting beside his father, Thunder Human King. Just as he filled his father’s wine cup, the corner of his eye caught a glimpse of Huang Xiaolong. His action paused for a second from surprise before flying to his feet with killing intent raging in his heart.

“You little punk, I didn’t expect you to really dare to run all the way here to Nine Dragons City to see some liveliness!” Lei Hua laughed out loud in a manic manner, his eyes had turned scarlet at the sight of Huang Xiaolong, akin to a berserk lion running amok.

In that split second, everyone on the first floor turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. Thunder Human King and his group of subordinates were the first who looked over.

“Father, that’s the punk who killed Zhou Yuchu!” Lei Hua was quick to point out Huang Xiaolong to the Thunder Human King.

“Oh!” A streak of light flashed deep within Thunder Human King’s pupils. The incident related to Zhou Yuchu’s murder, incurring Zhou Yunpeng’s wrath that required him to go apologize to him, kneeling before Zhou Yunpeng in front of all the Ape Deity Temple experts as to keep his son’s life had greatly made him lose face and dignity.

All of it was because of this punk!

Other experts dining on the first floor were stunned at the revelation. All of them knew about the Ape Deity Temple Master’ son, Zhou Yuchu, who was killed in Vermillion City, but it had never crossed their minds that the murderer would be a young human like the one before them.

By now, Elf Queen Kelly and Grand Elder Celine had also seen Huang Xiaolong. Seeing Huang Xiaolong, Elf Queen Kelly’s expression was filled with pleasant surprise. Her alluring eyes sparkled seemingly holding a thousand unspoken words.

Without needing the Thunder Human King to speak, his subordinates jumped to their feet, spreading out to encircle Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong raised an arm to stop the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey that was impatient to start fighting.

“So, you guys want to fight here?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Thunder Human King and Lei Hua with indifference.

The Thunder Human King frowned. This was the Nine Dragons City after all, and the Nine Dragons Temple had clearly decreed that anyone who dared to stir trouble or fight inside the city would be put to death regardless of their identity! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Although he, Thunder Human King, stood at the top of the human race on the Ten Directions Continent, in front of the Nine Dragons Temple he was nothing more than a fart. He wasn’t reckless to the point of ignoring the Nine Dragons Temple’s clear order.

“Father, we mustn’t let this punk go!” Lei Hua urged his father anxiously.

Thunder Human King waved his hand, recalling his subordinates, “Don’t worry, he won’t be able to run!” He looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Punk, I’ll let you live a few more days.”

Once the beastmen tribes and demonic beast clans’ merging ceremony concluded, the kid would need to leave the Nine Dragons City and they would deal with him then! The Thunder Human King was swift to decide and concoct a plan.

Hearing that these people dared to threaten Huang Xiaolong, the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey was greatly angered, his momentum surged, laced with thick killing intent. Demonic qi swept the first floor of the restaurant like a hurricane.

“Fifth Order Saint realm!”

Everyone who felt it was dumbfounded.

Still, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand, stopping the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey a second time. His gaze shifted coldly between the Thunder Human King and Lei Hua, “Let me live a few more days? Then I shall wait and see.”

In Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, these two were nothing but jumping clowns.

“Young Noble,” Elf Queen Kelly led Grand Elder Celine and some of the elves’ Elders, walking over with a faint smile on her face as she called out to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong could only smile in return, nodding his head in greeting.

“Young Noble healed the Tree of Life. After parting in the Elf Forest, I didn’t expect to run into Young Noble here. Would Young Noble like to sit with us?” Elf Queen Kelly took the initiative to invite Huang Xiaolong.

Waves of shock were hitting the hearts of the experts around, staring at Huang Xiaolong in astonishment. Some time ago, there was a rumor saying that the Tree of Life was cured. Once again, they did not expect that person to be this young man

Who exactly was this young man?! He even had a Fifth Order Saint realm demonic beast expert with him!

Those present tried to guess Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

Both the Thunder Human King and Lei Hua were also surprised hearing that this young man was the one who cured the Tree of Life, but even so, the Elf Queen’s initiative to invite Huang Xiaolong made the father and son’s expressions turn grim.

Seeing the Elf Queen taking the initiative to invite him, Huang Xiaolong contemplated for a moment, but still shook his head, “Many thanks for the Elf Queen’s kindness, but as I haven’t seen this good brother of mine for many years, it might be inconvenient as us brothers would like to share a few drinks in private. We’ve made a reservation for a private room on the second floor.”

He could see that the Elf Queen extended an invitation to him out of kindness, intending to protect him, indirectly telling the Thunder Human King that Huang Xiaolong was in good terms with the elf race. This way, the Thunder Human King would need to think twice before making a move on him.

However, when did Huang Xiaolong ever rely on a woman for protection?

Elf Queen Kelly couldn’t conceal the disappointment in her eyes at Huang Xiaolong’s refusal. Before, in the Elf Forest, Huang Xiaolong already refused her once. She believed that Huang Xiaolong was aware of her feelings. For the first time in her life, she began to doubt her own charm.

The surrounding patrons’ jaws fell agape when hey heard Huang Xiaolong turning down an invitation from the Elf Queen.

However, the Elf Queen recovered swiftly from her disappointment. Taking a glance at the human form Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey beside Huang Xiaolong, she smiled and asked, “It is Kelly who was inconsiderate. May I ask how many days Young Noble plans to stay in Nine Dragons City?”

Huang Xiaolong answered: “Most likely around two months.”

For the beastmen tribes and demonic beast clans’ merging ceremony, Huang Xiaolong needed some time to overlook the various aspects of integration and clear out the Deities Templar’s hidden forces on Ten Directions Continent. Thus, he estimated that he would need to stay for two months at least.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong says that he would be staying in Nine Dragons City for two months’ time, a bubble of joy filled the Elf Queen.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong spoke a little while more with Elf Queen Kelly before moving up to the second floor with the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey.

Watching the two people disappear up the second floor, the first floor broke out in a flurry of discussions, whereas a hesitant light flickered in Thunder Human King’s eyes following Huang Xiaolong’s disappearing silhouette.

“Lord, it seems like this kid is not so simple. Should we send someone to investigate his background?” A high-level Saint realm expert sitting beside Thunder Human King spoke.

The Sun Moon Restaurant’s private rooms on the second floor were reserved for important guests. Moreover, not just anyone could go up. The basic condition was that one had to possess a card specially issued by the restaurant. Just this point alone proved that the two young men’s identities weren’t simple.

“So what if it’s not simple?” Lei Hua interjected with a cold sneer, “Would we be afraid of him? Just a little white-faced lamb that has a tad bit of relationship with the Elf Queen. What can the Elf Queen do after we kill him?”

But Thunder Human King ordered in a solemn voice, “Investigate that demonic beast expert beside him.” A Fifth Order Saint realm demonic beast expert following beside a young human was strange in his eyes.

But then again, he wouldn’t put a mere Fifth Order Saint realm in his eyes.

“Yes, Lord.” The same subordinate beside the Thunder Human King acknowledged.

“But Father, if that punk really plans to stay in Nine Dragons City for two months, that would pose a small problem.”

It wasn’t convenient for them to deal with Huang Xiaolong within the city.

Thunder Human King reassured his son, “Don’t worry, I’m familiar with one of the Nine Dragons City’s small guard captains, we can let the small guard captain frame some crime on that kid and expel him out of the city.”

“Father is wise!” Lei Hua grinned, “Arrogant as that punk is, I bet he dares not offend the Nine Dragons Temple.”

At this time, in one of the private rooms on the second floor, the brothers ordered a table full of dishes, and wine cups clinked nonstop. Neither placed any importance on that Thunder Human King.

“Big brother, do you think Sister Li Lu will come to the Nine Dragons City?” The Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey suddenly said.

He was aware of certain things between Huang Xiaolong and Li Lu.
