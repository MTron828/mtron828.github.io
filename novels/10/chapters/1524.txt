Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help feeling surprised. Even though Senior Brother Jiang Hong was not a hundred percent certain, there was a source of grandmist aura in the Floating Twilight Land, and judging from his tone, there was a fifty percent probability. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Senior Brother, you told me about the grandmist aura, aren’t you afraid that I would...?” Huang Xiaolong hesitated before asking.

Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong understood the meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s question. He shook his head, then smiled and said, “The grandmist aura existed even before the Divine World came into being, but in these billions and billions of years, there has never been anyone other than you Junior Brother, who has actually obtained and refined it. In short, something like the grandmist aura, it is fated. It doesn’t change anything even if I tell you.”

Though that may be the case, Huang Xiaolong was moved.

“Then, based on Senior Brother’s estimation, the grandmist aura could be in the Floating Twilight Land’s Scarlet Blood Mountain Range?” asked Huang Xiaolong.

Jiang Hong nodded, and went on, “Not really, then again, even if the grandmist aura is not at the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range, it is in the proximity. It’s a place called the Ghost River.”

“Ghost River!” The little cow frowned when she heard that name.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the little cow. Was there something special about this Ghost River? Was it more dangerous than the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range?

The little cow explained, “The Ghost River is extremely strange. Those who have passed by the Ghost River have claimed hearing ghost calls, but they could not find the source of the noises. Moreover, in hundreds of millions of years, no less than ten million experts have gone missing around the Ghost River, including the Emperor Realm masters!”

Even Emperor Realm masters have gone missing!

Huang Xiaolong and the others were genuinely astonished hearing that.

“Based on my judgment, there should be another independent space in the proximity of the Ghost River, but it’s hard to find. The so-called ghost calls probably originate from this space, and the missing experts were probably ‘swallowed’ by that space.” The little cow went on, “Since Kiddo Jiang Hong says there is a source of grandmist aura around the Ghost River, I suspect that the grandmist aura is within that space!”

Jiang Hong nodded his head in agreement and said, “Senior Azure Cow’s opinion is the same as mine.”

Huang Xiaolong said to Jiang Hong, “Senior Brother, if truth be told, we’re going to the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range to look for the Blood Eye Devil Stele.”

Upon hearing ‘Blood Eye Devil Stele,’ Jiang Hong was nonchalant for a moment, then reacted with a shocked expression, “You’re talking about the Devil World’s Blood Eye Devil Stele, one of the Devil World’s six devil steles?!”

Huang Xiaolong had half expected Jiang Hong’s shocked expression, so he explained, “Yes, Senior Brother. In truth, I have already obtained the Blood Eye Devil Stele’s upper half, and learned from it’s broken memories that the lower half of the stele fell somewhere in the Floating Twilight Land. We thought it might possibly be at the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range, Black Flames Devil Cave, Death God’s Fortress, or the Martial Demon Emperor Palace headquarters’ Martial Demon Mountain. We plan to try the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range first!”

Since Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong had told him about the grandmist aura, Huang Xiaolong did not want to conceal the matter about the Blood Eye Devil Stele from him.

Moreover, he had already refined the upper half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele, thus even if Senior Brother Jiang Hong managed to find the lower half, he wouldn’t be able to refine it.

“Junior Brother’s luck is really good ah.” Jiang Hong said enviously after learning Huang Xiaolong had already obtained the upper half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele. “The Blood Eye Devil Stele is a top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact personally refined by the Archdevil Lord. No other average top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact can be compared to it."

Although Jiang Hong controlled the Divine World’s number one Emperor Palace while possessing the top-grade grandmist spiritual artifacts, he still couldn’t help feeling a bout of envy." Let’s go. We can talk on the way to the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range." The little cow interjected.

"Senior Azure Cow is right, Junior Brother, let’s make a move on." Jiang Hong agreed crisply.

"Sure!"

Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong, and the rest whistled over the forest, flying towards the deeper region of the Floating Twilight Land.

There was an indescribable feeling in Jiang Hong’s heart as he watched Huang Xiaolong riding on the little cow.

Anyone who knew what the little cow’s identity was in the past would feel the same.

Jiang Hong couldn’t help wondering how his Master would react to this sight?

While Huang Xiaolong’s group headed to the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range, the Demonic Python City’s Mayor had fled back to the Demonic Python City. By this time, the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace had received his message and already learned that the two Hall Masters Chen Xinde and Cui Wei were killed by Huang Xiaolong.

Furious roars shook the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace from top to bottom when they learned of the news.

Inside a certain space within the Martial Demon Emperor Palace, there was a middle-aged man sitting cross-legged in the midst of giant dragons condensed from blood.

These blood dragons were condensed from the middle-aged man’s own blood qi, and each of these blood dragons exuded a powerful aura that was no weaker than the average high-level Emperor Realm masters!

This middle-aged man was none other than the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Emperor, Mo Xiao!

When Mo Xiao received the message and read it, he stilled with disbelief. A mere Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple who had just arrived at the Floating Twilight Land had not only killed a disciple of his Martial Demon Emperor Palace, but also their Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Hall Master Cui Wei?!

This!

His first reaction was denial!

But when he read the rest of the message, it sounded even more unbelievable to him. This Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple actually has an Emperor Realm master mount!? A divine elephant at that!

This...! Since when did the Fortune Emperor Palace get so bullish?! A mere disciple actually has an Emperor Realm mount!

In the whole Martial Demon Emperor Palace, only he and several other Ancestors possessed Emperor Realm mounts!

In a flicker, Mo Xiao’s figure disappeared into a blur.

Half an hour later, inside the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s great hall, Mo Xiao sat on the main seat with an ugly expression as he looked at the gathered Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Hall Masters, and Grand Elders.

By now, he had confirmed that their Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Hall Master Cui Wei was dead, and the killer was merely a Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple!

The several Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Ancestors seated in a row on Mo Xiao’s left and right sides looked gloomy and sullen as well. It had been a long time since someone with such a standing from their Martial Demon Emperor Palace had been killed.

“Everyone, what do you all think of this matter?” Mo Xiao’s voice broke the great hall’s heavy atmosphere.

“Emperor, I’m willing to shoulder the responsibility of capturing the sinner to bring him back to the Martial Demon Emperor Palace!” A muscular man standing in the front row spoke in a gruff voice, his eyes were filled with murderous gleam.

This muscular man was the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Chief of Hall Masters Zhang Rong, a peak late-Sixth Order Emperor Realm master.

“It’s merely an early First Order Emperor Realm Ten Thousand Elephant, so there is no need for the Chief of Hall Masters to act personally. We two brothers are enough to capture him.” At this time, one of the silver-haired identical twins standing behind Zhang Rong spoke up.

These two identical young men were two of the most powerful among the many Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Hall Masters. Although their strengths were not at the same level as Zhang Rong, both were mid-level Emperor Realm masters. One was called Wang Shuchen, a mid-Fifth Order Emperor Realm master, and the other was called Wang Shuyu, a Fourth Order Emperor Realm master.

“However, how come an ordinary Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples has an Emperor Realm Ten Thousand Elephant mount? Isn’t it strange?” Ancestor Zhang Lu who was sitting beside Mo Xiao stated and frowned as he went on, “Moreover, he dared to kill Cui Wei despite knowing Cui Wei’s identity.”

“Old Man Zhang, you’re being overly cautious!” Another Ancestor, Chen Kaiwen sneered. “Regardless of who it is, or what kind of identity they have, since they dared to kill one of our Hall Masters, there is only one ending for this person—death! As the sixth ranked Emperor Palace, since when has our Martial Demon Emperor Palace been afraid of anyone?!”
