Chapter 3656: Severe Injuries

When Kun Feng and the rest thought that Mei Jie was there to seek justice on their behalf, Mei Jie bowed respectfully to Huang Xiaolong. “Lord Huang, I have long since left the Creation Palace. They have nothing to do with me. Right now, I am of the Zhu Family. Lord Huang, please understand that their fate has nothing to do with me.”

Entered the Zhu Family!

Their fates had nothing to do with him!

Kun Feng and the others stared at him in shock and those in the hall stared at each other in stunned silence.

However, his pleas seemed to have fallen of deaf ears as Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “I made a promise to Wang Meiqi to take revenge on her behalf. No matter what you say, I won’t let you off today.”

Mei Jie’s expression changed instantly. However, he looked a little confused. “Wang Meiqi?”

It was clear he didn’t know who Huang Xiaolong referred to.

“Wang Meiqi of the Fantasy Butterfly Race, First Universe.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Fantasy Butterfly Race?!” Mei Jie gasped. One of the memories he had tried to bury resurfaced.

Wang Meiqi!

Unwilling to give up his life like that, Mei Jie continued, “I wonder what relationship Lord Huang has with Wang Meiqi? Are you willing to offend my Zhu Family because of a mere woman? Are you planning to infuriate the master of our Zhu Lan Lands?”

Huang Xiaolong flung his sleeve once and he chuckled, “Do you think I’ll be afraid of your Zhu Family? Zhu Chen isn’t powerful enough to make me think twice about my actions.”

Mei Jie didn’t think that it was possible. Even though Huang Xiaolong blocked Jian Wushuang’s sword qi earlier, he still felt that Huang Xiaolong was some distance away from the other five overlords of the Unknown Lands.

In his eyes, there was no way Huang Xiaolong could challenge Zhu Chen! The brat should be afraid of the old ancestor of the Zhu Family!

From the words that came out of his mouth, it seemed as though…

The faces of Jian Wushuang and the rest changed when they realized the meaning behind his words.

Jian Weifeng felt the energy draining from his body. Why on earth did he offend an expert at Huang Xiaolong’s level?!

Zhu Jian had it the worst. He wasn’t even half as strong as Jian Weifeng, but he caused trouble for Huang Xiaolong time and time again! He was even plotting to kill the man! Despite no one doing anything, Zhu Jian felt as though he would suffocate at any time!

When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, Mei Jie leaped into the air and he disappeared. Just as he was about to leave the city, a thick branch appeared in the air above to stop him.

Mei Jie didn’t hesitate and the axe in his hand chopped at the branch that appeared.

A loud blast reverberated through the air and a burst of light filled the space above the city.

To everyone’s surprise, the third strongest expert in the Zhu Lan Lands, Mei Jie, who had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy, failed to destroy the obstruction that stood in his way! He was sent flying backwards from the impact.

Panic filled the hearts of those present.

Mei Jie’s axe was a pseudo Universe Treasure! Even so, it failed to destroy the branch!

Their gazes turned to the massive branch hovering in the air.

Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, and the others seemed to have thought of something and their eyes widened in shock.

“Star Dragon Divine Tree!”

Gasps of shock filled the air.

Countless roots and branches tore through the void at that instant and starlight fell upon the city. In an instant, day turned to night.

“Quick! Everyone, work together and destroy the Star Dragon Grand Formation!” Elder Baixuan Tian yelled. “We cannot allow the roots to link up! Otherwise, none of us will be able to escape!”

Elder Baixuan Tian moved the moment she spoke. The white staff in her hand emitted a bone-chilling glow and it smashed into a corner of the void around her.

Jian Wushuang and Gui Chi moved in unison.

An uncountable number of sword qi filled the skies and the river of time twisted under the power.

At the same time, countless devils filled the skies. The world seemed to turn into hell on earth as the devils charged into the void.

The experts in the hall circulated their grand cosmos energy and followed the actions of the trio. The combined might of more than a hundred experts who had broken through the 10 billion units barrier was a sight to behold! The world trembled around them as a terrifying amount of power smashed at the Star Dragon Grand Formation.

Boom!

Elder Baixuan Tian’s staff struck first, and Jian Wushuang’s attack came next. Gui Chi’s sea of devils came after and the Star Dragon Grand Formation trembled violently. Cracks started to form around the roots of the tree.

Almost everyone in the hall had attacked!

As everyone focused their attack on a single corner of the formation, it looked really possible that they would be able to destroy the point they were attacking!

When they sent another round of attack at the corner, a massive ship appeared. It was millions of miles long, and it emitted a dense universe energy. It stopped all the attacks dead in their tracks.

A slight tremble was all it suffered and considering the sheer size of the ship, it was as though nothing happened at all!

“Universe… Universe Boat!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets and his beard trembled.

The number one treasure in the thirteen universes! It actually appeared today!

It was in the hands of the Blue Dragon Young Master, and not only did he possess the Universe Boat, he also had the second ranked treasure in the thirteen universes, the Star Dragon Divine Tree!

The reactions of Elder Baixuan Tian, Gui Chi, and the rest were the same.

As despair filled their hearts, Huang Xiaolong’s figure emerged from the Universe Boat. He held the Three Gods Halberd in his hand and the four Universe Origin Fires surrounded his body. Those standing against him felt a searing pain shooting through the dao souls as they looked at him.

“Three… Three Gods Halberd!”

“Universe Origin Fires!”

It seemed as though there was no hope of winning any more.

As Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed, he appeared before Mei Jie. Panicking, Mei Jie didn’t know how to react! It was at that moment, Huang Xiaolong’s halberd stabbed towards his chest. Even though he raised his axe to block the strike, the Three Gods Halberd tore through the axe like it was paper! Blowing a hole through Mei Jie’s chest, the tip of the halberd exited from his back!FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mei Jie’s body froze in mid air as he stared at his wound in shock.

The experts who were thinking of bombarding the Universe Boat with everything they had stopped.

“Father!” Zhu Jian cried.

Huang Xiaolong pulled out the halberd mercilessly. His dao heart was in tatters and the Universe Origin Fires entered Mei Jie’s body the moment the halberd was retrieved. It burned his dao soul and Mei Jie fell to the ground in pain. His body was charred black and from afar, he looked like a piece of charcoal.

Sharp intakes of breath could be heard all around.
