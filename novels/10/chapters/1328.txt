Half an hour had passed, but the chaos lightning pool space was still shrinking in size.

As the chaos lightning pool space continued to shrink, everyone was now able to see the other edge of the pool that they had not been able to see initially.

The edge of the chaos lightning space was a lightning barrier formed from numerous golden-colored symbols. Even at this point, none of them could tell how thick or how tall this lightning barrier was.

Feng Er, Xu Baisheng and the rest paled slightly as they felt the barrier’s terrifying and destructive lightning power, while they watched the chaos lightning barrier growing smaller and getting closer to them.

After spending more than a decade of focused cultivation and recovery in the chaos lightning pool space, void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s strength had exceeded Feng Er’s, returning to his peak power before he was imprisoned in the Devil Prison Mountain.

Unfortunately, as he faced the chaos lightning barrier, he couldn’t even evoke the thought of resistance. Desite he had returned to his peak strength, he felt as small as an ant.

Xu Baisheng didn’t doubt in the slightest that if he were to get struck by this chaos lightning barrier, he would be smashed into dust to be forgotten forever.

Everyone felt an overwhelming sense of danger as they continued to watch the shrinking chaos lightning.

Ten thousand li!

Eight thousand li!

Seven thousand li!

Five thousand, four thousand, three thousand, one thousand, several hundred li, a dozen li...!

Less than ten li!

The chaos lightning barrier was akin to an overpowering lightning god with violent streaks of lightning whipping out at them

Everyone leaped and jumped back repeatedly in dread.

However, the chaos lightning barrier closed in on them from all directions. There was no place left for them to hide or escape.

“Don’t be afraid.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice suddenly sounded in their ears.

Feng Er and the others blanked for a second at Huang Xiaolong’s words. In the next second, they watched the chaos lightning pool space turning into a golden lightning symbol that flew into Huang Xiaolong’s forehead. A golden lightning symbol appeared between his brows, and at the same time, his body was bathed in flickering golden streaks of lightning. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone looked around them; the lightning energy, devil qi, death qi, and nefarious qi were floating in the air. Below them was a mainland. This was the Lightning Pool Mainland that they were in before.

Back outside, everyone was beaming with joy, but at the same time, there was a sense of lost.

Huang Xiaolong looked at his own True Dragon Physique that was recreated by the golden lightning liquid. His fists clenched as he enjoyed the terrifying defenses and power in his muscles. He punched towards the mountain range by employing all his physical power.

The several million li mountain range that had existed for an unknown million years suddenly exploded into pieces of rocks, and was reduced to a flat land. Lightning energy rose from the ground with an astounding intensity.

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air as they watched this.

The mountains in Lightning Pool Mainland were tempered by lightning energy for millions of years, hence, they were almost impenetrable. The full force punch from a First Order Ancestor God Realm master would merely break a few pieces of gravel at most. But now, Huang Xiaolong had crushed the entire mountain range. What was the power of Huang Xiaolong’s two fists’ punch?!

Not to mention, they could see that Huang Xiaolong was still a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm—he had yet to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm!

There was no surprise on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he looked at the flattened mountain range. Based on his current strength, even without his primordial blue divine dragon transformation, he could easily send a Second Order Ancestor God Realm master flying with a single punch...!

His True Dragon Physique had evolved further through these years of tempering by the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool. Hence, even though he had yet to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm, he was stronger than the average late-Second Order Ancestor God Realm master.

However, a wry smile rose to his face. In the end, he was still stuck at peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.

To breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm, his flesh, godforce, and soul had to reach a state of perfection. Huang Xiaolong’s flesh and godforce met this condition, however, his soul was still too weak, hence, he was still unable to take the next step to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm.

“Brat, what’s with that face? You broke through to peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm from Eighth Order Ancient God Realm, and you are still not satisfied?” The little cow went up and chided to Huang Xiaolong when she noticed Huang Xiaolong’s expression, and added, “If Wang Wei, Zhu Feng, Wangu Ziyi, Guo Jun, or even Feng Yingying came to know about this, they would go die by banging their heads against a cow.”

Die banging their heads against a cow!

Feng Er and others laughed out loud, momentarily forgetting about their shock.

Huang Xiaolong laughed as well. In truth, the little cow Xiaoniu was right. In a little over a decade, he had broken through to peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm from Eight Order Ancient God Realm, therefore, he should be satisfied. Furthermore, he had comprehended the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s esoteric and now was it’s master. He had reaped an abundant harvest.

“Xiaoniu, how far do you think my soul is from achieving the state of perfection?” Huang Xiaolong said to the little cow.

The little cow’s golden horns moved in the air, shooting out a streak of purple lightning that wrapped around Huang Xiaolong. A while later, she retrieved her purple lightning and shook her head, “It’s still far from perfection. To put it this way, if your soul’s perfection stage is 100, then you’re not even one, maybe just around 0.2”

If 100 was perfection, he hadn’t even reached 1! Only 0.2!

Despite knowing his soul was far from achieving the state of perfection, the little cow’s answer rendered Huang Xiaolong speechless.

In recent years, he had swallowed many precious treasures that had nourished his soul, moreover, he had the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell, therefore, he was surprised that his soul was still weak.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong was not in the mood to ask the little cow about how he could improve his soul, as he was concerned about Li Lu. As he was trapped inside the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool for more than a decade, he was now wondering what had happened to Li Lu? Subsequently, he thought of the Fortune Gate. Did his Masters have news of Li Lu?

Thinking of this, Huang Xiaolong quickly took out a special communication artifact that was given to him by Golden Brow Ancestor and sent a message to him.

His Masters, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor replied almost immediately. There was delight in their replies; they mentioned that they had news of Li Lu and that she was safe, he didn’t need to worry about her. They also asked where he had disappeared for the last decade, and why they couldn’t get in touch with him? They also inquired if there had been any accident?

From these chain of questions it was apparent to Huang Xiaolong that they had been anxious.

Joy and warmth intermingled in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. He was joyous because he had news of Li Lu’s safety. He was rest assured now.

He then replied to Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, and assured them of his safety, as he explained to them that his group was trapped in a wandering space, and they had just broken free from it.

Huang Xiaolong replied to a few more of his Masters’ questions before ending the conversation. At this moment, he turned to the little cow and finally asked how he could strengthen his soul.

The little cow searched through her memories, and then said solemnly, “The fastest way is the divine pills that could strengthen the soul. The most effective one I know of is a chaos spiritual pill named Brilliant Black Soul Divine Pill, the ingredients to refine it are hard to find. One of the hardest herbs could be found in the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield, but that place is extremely dangerous.”

Huang Xiaolong was happy, and he asked urgingly, “Where is that?”

“Soulless Star!” The little cow answered.

“Soulless Star!” Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er exclaimed in shock just hearing the name.

While Huang Xiaolong’s group was discussing about the Soulless Star, the furrows between Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s brows relaxed, as they sat within the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s Assembly Shrine main hall. After Huang Xiaolong had gone missing, the two of them were as anxious as ants on a hot pan, but now they were relaxed.

“But, are we really not going to tell Xiaolong about what happened to Li Lu?” Blood Knife Ancestor asked with hesitation.

Although Li Lu had returned to the Fortune Gate, there was something wrong with her body. She was comatosed, as she was affected by the evil spirits.

Golden Brow Ancestor said, “If all of us join our hands, we might be able to force that evil spirits out of her completely. Therefore, for the time being, let’s keep this from Xiaolong.”
