Chapter 3535: Every One Left

 

The moment he entered seclusion, Huang Xiaolong turned into the Star Dragon Divine Tree.  Countless roots pierced straight into the two peak-grade universe-level spiritual veins.

Huang Xiaolong planned to refine them both at once.

After fusing with the Star Dragon Divine Tree, his physical body was comparable to the toughest treasure! Absorbing both spiritual veins at the same time wasn’t an impossibility.

In the blink of an eye, several hundred thousand years passed.

Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang, who had been guarding him the whole time, stared at him from time to time.

“His Highness should be emerging soon, right?” Ao Shenghai asked.

“When he emerges, I will no longer be his opponent!” Ao Guang sighed as complex emotions filled his heart. When Huang Xiaolong had saved him in the Dragon’s Impasse, he barely had 4 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Now, he had long since surpassed Ao Guang!

“I’m afraid His Highness will be able to surpass me in less than ten million years…” Ao Shenghai was similarly conflicted.

“I’m afraid it will only take half the time…” Ao Guang chuckled.

Since they returned from the Dragon’s Impasse, five million years had barely passed. Yet, Huang Xiaolong had already caught up to Ao Guang.

“Brother Shenghai, you should be near the peak of the God of Creation Realm, right?” 

In the past, Huang Xiaolong gave them the remaining Star Dragon Scales before he entered seclusion. Ao Guang could clearly feel the change in Ao Shenghai, and he should be close to the peak of the God of Creation Realm.

A smile formed on Ao Shenghai’s face. “I can probably break through soon. It won’t take more than several million years.”

He had been stuck at the grand completion stage for quite some time now. After refining the scales, he had hopes of breaking through to the next level. The moment he crossed the giant barrier, he would be a peak-level God of Creation!

“Congratulations, Brother Shenghai!” Ao Guang cupped his fists and sighed.

“It’s all thanks to His Highness,” Ao Shenghai waved his hands and explained.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When the two of them were happily chatting with each other, the space Huang Xiaolong hid himself in started to emit flashes of light. A figure tore through the skies, and they quickly identified Huang Xiaolong as the person who emerged.

“Your Highness!” They rushed over in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong nodded casually at the both of them.

“Your Highness, did you refine all of them?” Ao Shenghai couldn’t help but ask.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong knew he referred to the more than seventy universe-level spiritual veins he obtained from the members of the alliance.

The two of them were shocked.

It had been less than six hundred thousand years, and Huang Xiaolong refined more than seventy universe-level spiritual veins!

The two of them would never know that Huang Xiaolong not only did that. He also managed to raise the level of the Sun Moon Furnace and the Purple Lightning Peak.

“Your Highness, what about your strength now?” Ao Guang asked.

Huang Xiaolong raised his finger, and a ray of light shot towards Ao Guang. Without time to react, Ao Guang could only gather all his strength in his fist to stop the ray of light.

Boom!

Retreating countless of miles, Ao Guang found himself in the middle of space when he finally found his footing.

The four of them chose a random planet to settle down in the alliance, and it wasn’t a tiny little one like Earth. It was several tens of thousands of times larger than Earth, but Huang Xiaolong sent Ao Guang out with a single stream of power. He clearly didn’t use his full strength, and it would be amazing if he utilized half of what he was capable of.

Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang gasped in shock.

Ao Guang was a God of Creation with more than 7.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy, but his actual combat strength was higher than that!

Even so, he was sent flying!

Huang Xiaolong spoke when the two of them were still stuck in a state of shock. “How many universe-level spiritual veins do you think the Gods of Creation in the Solitary Alliance possess? What about the Hundred Kingdoms Alliance?”

Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang stared at him in shock. It was clear they didn’t expect a question like that.

“Do you mean… Do you wish to trade your Star Dragon Scales with the other alliances?” Ao Shenghai understood what he meant instantly.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He wanted to look for naturally formed great worlds in the Black Sea to increase his strength, but since he could obtain universe-level spiritual veins, the effects were the same! After all, the Black Sea was too dangerous. Trading for universe-level spiritual veins was much safer.

Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang stared at each other silently.

“Even though Your Highness might be able to obtain a lot of them, you will definitely attract the attention of every single power in the First Universe. Their suspicions will rise, and some of them might start plotting against you. If the true experts start to move, you will be in serious danger.” Ao Shenghai frowned.

Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter, “They can guess all they want. After all, I’m afraid that they won’t move against me.”

If he could obtain a hundred more universe-level spiritual veins, he would be able to enter the large completion stage! When that happened, he would no longer be afraid of experts at the peak of the God of Creation Realm! After all, he still had the Star Dragon Divine Tree. As such, he wouldn’t be afraid that anyone would covet his Star Dragon Scales when he traveled around.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong’s desire to trade Star Dragon Scales for universe-level spiritual veins started to rock the First Universe.

Other than members of the Creation Palace, everyone was welcome to trade with him!

On the very first day the news started to spread, Gods of Creation of the various factions flocked to the Eternal Heaven Alliance.

The Star Dragon Scales were extremely precious treasures to the Gods of Creation. It wasn’t something people could obtain even if they had countless treasures. Everyone who had universe-level spiritual veins couldn’t wait to make the trade with Huang Xiaolong.

When Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong heard what Huang Xiaolong did, strange looks appeared on their faces. However, they couldn’t say a thing as the scales belonged to Huang Xiaolong. He could trade with anyone he wanted, and they had no reason to stop him. After all, they traded away everything they could previously. They could only watch as the Star Dragon Scales entered the hands of the experts of the other alliances. 

In the initial half a year, the number of spiritual veins Huang Xiaolong obtained didn’t increase by much. That was because those who wanted to make the trade had to travel far and wide in order to arrive at the Eternal Heaven Alliance. When they finally arrived, the number of universe-level spiritual veins Huang Xiaolong possessed increased to a terrifying level.

Three years later, he obtained more than a hundred!

In the fourth year, he had a hundred and twenty universe-level spiritual veins in his possession.

They only stopped coming after four and a half years!

Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi stared at the spiritual veins in Huang Xiaolong’s possession, and they were struck speechless.

“This… This should be all the universe-level spiritual vein in the First Universe!” Wang Meiqi muttered to herself.

The First Universe might have existed for a long time and produced quite a number of universe-level spiritual veins, but they were limited in quantity! According to their estimations, Huang Xiaolong probably had a huge portion of it!

“Even if there are more out there, there won’t be too many of them left…” Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

The universe-level spiritual veins in the First Universe were about to be refined by a single man!
