Chapter 3463: Surpassed That Level

Before Huang Xiaolong arrived, many world masters said that they would take Huang Xiaolong down on the Northern Court Celestial Empire’s behalf. However, none of them dared to make a peep when the demon king was actually walking towards them.

“Young man, you’re pretty strong,” Bei Ting muttered. “As long as you’re willing to admit your mistakes and serve my Northern Court Celestial Empire, I’ll forgive you.”

Everyone stared at Bei Ting in shock, including Bei Yanrui!

“After you enter the Northern Court Celestial Empire, I’ll allow you to follow by my side. You can ask me any questions on cultivation.” Bei Ting continued, “You can ask me anything, including the way to enter the God of Creation Realm.”

The world masters present sucked in a cold breath. They stared at Huang Xiaolong enviously. Every single one there wished to enter the God of Creation Realm, but it was just too difficult! If they had the assistance of a God of Creation, breaking through would be much easier!

Moreover, Bei Ting was an expert who had reached the peak of the small completion stage in the God of Creation Realm!

Not even the celestial emperor, Bei Yanrui, was allowed to follow at Bei Ting’s side! Much less Huang Xiaolong, a complete outsider!

A trace of envy formed in Bei Yanrui’s heart.

When everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong would thank Bei Ting profusely, he muttered softly, “I never had the habit of submitting to anyone else.”

Everyone stared at him with their eyes wide open.

Did he just reject Lord Bei Ting?!

“I don’t need your help to break through to the God of Creation Realm.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed.

What a joke! Huang Xiaolong’s master was the Blazing Dragon, a God of Creation at the grand completion stage! The old dragon was an existence with 9 billion units of grand cosmos energy, and his father, Huang Long, was a God of Creation who had 8 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Why the hell would he need a God of Creation who hadn’t broken through to the large completion stage to guide him? Bei Ting wasn’t even as strong as him to begin with!

Bei Ting couldn’t even compare to Xuan Hai who was beaten up so badly that he had to run away from Huang Xiaolong with all his might!

A frown formed on Bei Ting’s face when he heard the rejection. He didn’t expect anyone to reject the teachings of a God of Creation! There would be people dying to take his place!

Staring at Huang Xiaolong, Bei Ting’s tone grew colder. “Are you sure? If you follow my teachings, your chances of entering the God of Creation Realm will grow by leaps and bounds!”

“Do you really think that you can break into the God of Creation Realm anytime you wish? You might never be able to break through without my help!”

A flash of cold light crossed his eyes, and he continued, “If you refuse my offer, do you really think that I’ll let you leave after you killed so many experts of my empire? According to the rules I set, I’ll execute you on the spot!”

Execute him?!

Killing intent filled the skies as soon as he made the declaration!

Everyone felt their hearts turning cold.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, Huang Xiaolong chuckled nonchalantly, “Excuse me? We’ll see if you’re capable of that.”

Bei Ting’s expression sank to the freezing point.

“Old Ancestor, please allow me to do battle!” Bei Yanrui stood out all of a sudden to make his request.

?!

Everyone turned to stare at him in shock.

Snorting coldly, Bei Ting agreed, “Alright.”

Since Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a God of Creation, he felt that Bei Yanrui wouldn’t lose too badly no matter how strong he was.

He really wanted to see the depths of Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

Slowly walking over to Huang Xiaolong, a pair of long swords appeared in Bei Yanrui’s hands. A powerful aura filled the space around him the moment they appeared.

“Twin Dragon Swords!”

Various experts yelled in unison.

The Twin Dragon Swords weren’t at the level of a creation artifact, but they were both pseudo-creation artifacts. When they were used together, their might could rival a creation artifact!

When everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong would fight Bei Yanrui, Gu Yuan stepped out from behind Huang Xiaolong and bowed. “Your Highness, please allow me.”

“No. There’s no need.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head.

Even though Gu Yuan was more than capable of suppressing Bei Yanrui, Huang Xiaolong didn’t wish to waste his time with them.

Huang Xiaolong took a step forward and gestured for Bei Yanrui to start.

“Bring out your weapons!” Bei Yanrui tutted. The Twin Dragon Swords in his hands rang incessantly as the dragon qi around his body started to fluctuate wildly. It was clear that he was dying to fight!

“There’s no need for that either,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Everyone looked at him like they were looking at a madman.

“How can he be so arrogant?” Jing Wenxiu, the world master of the Black Jade Holy World, growled.

Jing Wenxiu was the strongest world master in the Shi Li World! His strength was comparable to Bei Yanrui, and he was extremely discontent with Huang Xiaolong’s attitude.

“When Bei Yanrui’s swords tear through his skin, that kid’s expression will be a sight to behold…” Someone else sneered. Everyone there was more than happy to watch Huang Xiaolong embarrass himself.

Bei Yanrui moved instantly. Sword qi filled the air and two giant dragons appeared behind Bei Yanrui. If anyone was struck by the dragons, they would be skewered by countless strands of sword qi!

Seeing as the two dragons were about to turn Huang Xiaolong into a human kebab, he stretched a single hand out to grab the dragons by the neck. The sword qi that filled the air disappeared instantly.

Bei Yanrui’s figure appeared in front of everyone.

Jing Wenxiu’s eyes widened when he saw how easily Huang Xiaolong dealt with Bei Yanrui! He used his bare hands to counter the attack of an expert who was second to only God of Creation Realm experts!

When everyone was stuck in a daze, Huang Xiaolong’s palm landed on Bei Yanrui’s chest.

Bang!

A dull thud rang through the air as Bei Yanrui’s armor was shattered completely. Huang Xiaolong’s energy shot through Bei Yanrui’s back, and the celestial emperor was sent flying. He was stopped by the Ice Palace, and the wall shook violently upon impact.

The Twin Dragon Swords stabbed straight into the ground below.

“Your Majesty!”

“Celestial Emperor!”

The experts of the Northern Court Celestial Empire roared and their expression changed instantly. All of them flew towards Bei Yanrui to render their assistance.

Spitting out mouthfuls of blood, Bei Yanrui ignored them all as he stared at Huang Xiaolong in trepidation.

The palm strike that landed on him surpassed anything a Dao Venerable could do! Huang Xiaolong had long since surpassed their level!
