Just as the few of them were discussing with each other, Huang Xiaolong arrived at another mountain range. There, he saw several rhinoceros types of hell beasts.

These hell beasts stood ten meters tall and there was a jet-black horn growing out of their faces. Their eyes were completely red in color and they were emitting a faint green glow around their body.

This was a type of hell beast called the Venomous Wind Rhinos and they moved extremely quickly. The horns on their heads were incomparably sharp and poison would be released in their victim’s body as soon as a tiny cut was made. Even a Heavenly Monarch would be unable to resist this poison.

Looking at the Venomous Wind Rhinos rushing towards him, Huang Xiaolong released sword qi all around him and they seemed to bloom like wildflowers. The sword qi he released pierced through the bodies of all the rhinos and all of them were turned into sieves in a matter of seconds.

The pack of Venomous Wind Rhinos charging at him suddenly stopped and their bodies shattered in the next instant.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop there. The moment he arrived in the space above the pack of Venomous Wind Rhinos, all seven to eight hundred of them were slain.

“That’s one hell of a sword qi...” The Demon King Fan Hui exclaimed in shock.

“It isn’t just strong...” Asura King, Jin Yuan, praised in shock, “His sword qi has already reached an unimaginable level. Even if a genius in the way of the sword were to try to comprehend to his level, he would take at least several million years!”

“His bone age test results stated that he isn’t even a thousand years old yet...”

“That means that his comprehension abilities are just as terrifying as his natural talent for cultivation!”

......

In a flash, one day passed.

Huang Xiaolong appeared in one of the mountain valleys, and he swept through the test token on his body. There were several lines already inscribed on it and Huang Xiaolong read through them all.

“Seventh Order God King Realm, 32312.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Eighth Order God King Realm, 12213.”

“Ninth Order God King Realm, 3124.”

“Tenth Order God King Realm, 628.”

This was the result of him running around on a rampage in a single day.

He had killed more than forty thousand beasts on his first day in the plane!

If the number of hell beasts he had killed were to start spreading, the three great worlds in hell would probably erupt into a massive upheaval.

Anyone who had taken the Netherking test in the past would only be able to kill a hundred or so hell beasts in the same realm as them in a day. That would also mean that they would be barely able to pass the test. As for Huang Xiaolong, he had killed more than 3700 hell beasts in the Ninth Order God King Realm or higher on his first day!

That wasn’t a mere thirty times the other participants...

Even the four chiefs who had looked through the results of countless participants in the past millions of years couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

“He killed more than 3700 hell beasts at the Ninth Order God King Realm or higher on the first day!” Demon King Fan Hui, revealed a complicated expression as he continued to predict, “Doesn’t that mean that he will be able to kill more than a hundred thousand of them in a month?!”

Thirty times three thousand was only ninety thousand!

A hundred thousand hell beasts was way more than thirty times the required amount!

If that were to happen, Huang Xiaolong would set an unprecedented record in the Netherworld King’s Organization!

If that were to happen, he would be able to raise any request to the organization! Since the creation of the organization, this would be the first time anyone would be able to raise an undeniable request to the entirety of the Netherworld King’s Organization!

Wan Yutian shook his head and said, “This is just the first day. Even though his performance is extremely shocking, his consumption of godforce and the fatigue accumulated in his body wouldn’t be small. His speed will greatly decrease in the coming days and in my honest opinion, he wouldn’t be able to hit thirty times the required number.”

The Desolate Giant, Tai Yue, muttered to himself, “That’s true. Weren’t there horrifying talents in the past who were able to kill ten thousand beasts on the first day itself? Didn’t their efficiency of killing the hell beasts drop to around three thousand on the second day?”

Jin Yuan didn’t reply, but he nodded silently in his head. It was obvious he didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong would be able to kill more than ninety thousand beasts by the end of one month.

In a flash, the second day of the test passed.

Huang Xiaolong scanned through his token again.

“Seventh Order God King Realm, 71322.”

“Eighth Order God King Realm, 25461.”

“Ninth Order God King Realm, 7234.”

“Tenth Order God King Realm, 1558.”

On the second day, the number of hell beasts that died under his hands numbered more than a hundred thousand already!

Out of all of them, the number of hell beasts that were in the Ninth Order God King Realm or higher numbered more than eight thousand!

It didn’t matter if it was the total number of hell beasts Huang Xiaolong slayed the second day, or the number of beasts stronger than a Ninth Order God King; he killed more of them on the second day than the first.

At the end of the second day, all four chiefs fell into silence as they stared at his battle record.

If the shock on the first day was like a tremor in their heart, the tremor turned into a full-blown earthquake on the second day.

The number of hell beasts he killed on the second day was more than the first!!!

“This kid... His True Dragon Physique allows him to recover both his godforce and energy at the same time...” Fan Hui hesitated for a long time before forcing the words out of his mouth.

This was his findings on the second day of Huang Xiaolong’s test.

The rules of the test stated that they weren’t allowed to consume any spiritual pills to regain their lost godforce throughout the entire duration. However, all of them realized that Huang Xiaolong had not weakened in the slightest on the second day.

“Even though it’s a type of unique divine physique that allows him to regain his lost godforce and energy, how can the speed be so terrifying?!” Jin Yuan chuckled in a bitter voice.

“If he keeps up his pace, won’t he be able to kill forty times the required number?!” Tai Yue said all of a sudden.

The four of them looked at each other and fell into silence.

Forty times!

When they thought of the massive number, all of them felt their hearts shudder.

On the third day of Huang Xiaolong’s test, a massive flying ship appeared in the skies above Mongolia City. The words ‘Netherworld King’ was inscribed on the body of the ship and the pressure it emitted was massive.

A group of people flew out of the ship and the people in the lead were naturally Wang Sinan and the Gu Family’s grand elder, Gu Cheng.

A hundred thousand Netherguards followed behind them and the moment Wang Sinan emerged from the flying ship, he headed towards the Netherworld King’s Organization branch. His face was gloomy and it was clear he was out for blood as he led the hundred thousand Netherguards over.

With the appearance of so many experts at once, everyone in Mongolia City noticed their arrival.

Under the lead of Wang Sinan and Gu Cheng, everyone felt a massive weight pressing against their heart.

“It’s Lord Wang Sinan!”

“The grand elder of the Gu Family has arrived, Senior Gu Cheng is here as well!”

“Gu Zheng was Gu Cheng’s one and only disciple. They were as close as father and son, and there is no doubt he was going to show up the moment Gu Zheng was killed. That Asura noble is going to die a horrible death this time!”

The streets of Mongolia City were filled with experts from all the different families and all of them broke out into discussion as they stared at Gu Cheng and Wang Sinan with a trace of fear in their eyes.

In the main hall of the Netherworld King’s Organization branch, Jia Yuan quickly received the news of their arrival.
