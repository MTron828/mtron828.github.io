“It seems like all these superpowers are invited by the Asura Gate. Are they celebrating something?” The Golden Lionman Wan Yutian asked.

“We’ll know as soon as we ask someone about it.” A brilliant light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Just as they were talking about it, a group of disciples wearing deep yellow armor flew towards them.

“They are the disciples of the Dragon Lion Sect.” Jin Yuan instantly revealed their identity.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and he recalled the information about them. The Dragon Lion Sect might be strong, but they didn’t rank high among all the superpowers. They were ranked in the 130s.

Of course, they might seem weak to Huang Xiaolong, but that wasn’t the case for everyone else. They were an unrivaled existence to the weaker powers and possessed a type of indisputable prestige as one of the top superpowers in the Hell Asura World.

Huang Xiaolong and the four of them quickly flew towards the group of the Dragon Lion Sect’s disciples.

“May we know why the Asura Gate invited so many experts? Is there some grand event going on right now?” The moment they arrived before the group of disciples of the Dragon Lion Sect, Fan Hui immediately opened his mouth and asked.

Huang Xiaolong and the four of them were disguised at the moment, and Huang Xiaolong wore the robes of a seven star Netherking. As for the four chiefs, they wore the robes of a ten star Netherking.

Seven star meant that he was in the Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Ten star meant that they were at the very least, Emperors!

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother taking the test to officially become a seven star Netherking, who would be able to stop him from declaring himself as a seven star Netherking?

Anyone would feel offended when stopped by random people on the street, and the Dragon Lion Sect disciples were no different. However, when they saw the robes of a ten star Netherking on Fan Hui and the rest, all of them felt their hearts shake a little. They hastily stopped and the ancestor of the Dragon Lion Sect stepped forward to reply to Fan Hui’s question.

“The disciple of the ancestor of the Asura Gate, Wei Hong, is getting married today!”

When Huang Xiaolong and the four chiefs heard what he said, they were stunned for a second.

What a coincidence!

“Is the bride an Asura Gate disciple going by the name of Wang Mengqin?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask.

Even though Huang Xiaolong asked the question, the Dragon Lion Sect’s ancestor didn’t dare to dally as he replied, “Yes, that’s right.”

Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes and a chilly light flashed through them.

“How many superpowers did the Asura Gate invite today?”

“This... I’m not too sure. However, there should be several tens of superpowers attending today. Other than them, the thousands of families and clans under the Asura Gate will be participating.”

Huang Xiaolong continued to ask several questions and the general situation formed in his mind.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong turned around and spoke to Jin Yuan and the rest.

Seeing the four Emperor Realm experts follow behind Huang Xiaolong after a single order from him, everyone from the Dragon Lion Sect felt a tremor run through their heart.

Even if the young sect master of one of the top hundred superpowers went out on an adventure, there was no way that they would be able to bring four Emperors as their bodyguard.

“Ancestor... Could that seven star Netherking be the young master of the top ten superpowers?!” One of the grand elders couldn’t hold his curiosity in and asked.

The ancestor simply shook his head and he didn’t bother replying. Instead, he sank deep into thought.

The pressure Jin Yuan and the three released was enough to suppress even himself. He was already in the early-Second Order Emperor Realm. Even a Third Order Emperor Realm expert would be unable to suppress him with just their aura. He was sure that Jin Yuan and the others were at the very least, in the middle stages of the Emperor Realm.

He had done his research and knew every single young master in the top ten superpowers. That seven star Netherking that had appeared in front of him definitely didn’t belong to any of them.

The more he thought about it, the more confused he became. A trace of doubt even formed in his mind.

“It seems like things are going to get interesting...” The ancestor of the Dragon Lion Sect muttered to himself.

The five of them are probably not on the invitation list. Otherwise, why will they be asking for the purpose of our visit?

“Ancestor, do you mean that the few of them are here to cause trouble for the Asura Gate?” Another grand elder seemed somewhat bewildered.

“Causing trouble in the Asura Gate?! Unless they are late stage Emperors, none of them are going to survive!”

“Could they be here to snatch the bride? I felt something off when the seven star Netherking asked about Wang Mengqin...”

A few of the disciples from the Dragon Lion Sect started to joke around.

Before long, all of them returned to their mounts, the Dragon Lions, and flew towards the headquarters of the Asura Gate.

As for Huang Xiaolong’s party of five, they arrived at the plane located on the top of the Divine Tree of Darkness.

Due to the Divine Tree of Darkness, the plane was named the Divine Darkness Plane.

The Asura Gate’s headquarters was made up of thousands of planes. The Divine Darkness Plane was the true heart of the Asura Gate and it was precisely where the main hall was located.

Of course, the wedding would take place in the main hall but there was another surprising fact. The Black Prison of the Asura Gate was also located on the Divine Darkness Plane.

Even though everyone was on guard and all the invitations were checked before the guests were allowed in, it wasn’t an issue for Huang Xiaolong to get the five of them in.

“Why don’t we scout the area to look for the Black Prison before doing anything else?” Huang Xiaolong said as he stood in the space above the Divine Darkness Plane.

Their main goal this time was to rescue his master, Ren Wokuang from the Black Prison.

“Yes, master.” The Desolate Giant, Tai Yue, agreed respectfully.

The five of them broke through the space and flew towards the Divine Darkness Plane.

“I heard that Wei Hong is going to sentence Ren Wokuang to death after the wedding ceremony.”

“Ren Wokuang has always been an upright person... Alas, his fate really is a miserable one... Previously, his master, Deng Zhilong, had announced to the world that they were breaking off all relations as master and disciple. Now, even his woman, Wang Mengqin, is betraying him!”

“I heard that Wei Hong would be releasing Ren Wokuang after Wang Mengqin accepted his proposal. I’m pretty sure that’s the only reason Wang Mengqin agreed to the marriage. It’s too bad Wei Hong plans to secretly kill Ren Wokuang after obtaining Wang Mengqin’s body after the marriage... It seems like he is a despicable b*stard after all...”

“Wang Mengqin is too naive... Didn’t Wei Hong order people to drag senior brother Ren into the wedding hall for him to witness the wedding? He is simply too cruel...”

Huang Xiaolong managed to hear lots of rumors and news regarding the marriage while trying to locate the Black Prison.

When he saw the disciples of the Asura Gate leaving, his body stopped moving.

“Master, are we going to...” Tai Yue hesitated for a moment before asking.

“We’re heading to the main hall right now.” Huang Xiaolong’s frosty voice echoed through the air.

Since Wei Hong was going to force Ren Wokuang into watching the wedding ceremony, there was no longer a reason to look for the Black Prison.

In the next moment, the five of them headed straight towards the main hall.

Huang Xiaolong saw that the mountains and rivers in the Divine Darkness Plane were decorated with crystals the color of the rainbow. These crystals emitted brilliant light, in honor of the celebrations about to take place.

As he followed the rest of the participants of the wedding ceremony, Huang Xiaolong made his way to the peak of a mountain where all the preparations were already done.

Huang Xiaolong and the four chiefs arrived at the plaza in the waist of the mountain and the atmosphere was at its peak by the time they arrived.

It was bustling with excitement as everyone greeted the people they knew from the other factions.

Huang Xiaolong chose a relatively quieter location and sat down before releasing his divine sense. As soon as his master, Ren Wokuang, appeared, he would immediately know.

Along the way, he picked up the conversations of all the disciples around him. Before long, the image of his master formed inside his head and as soon as he appeared, Huang Xiaolong would be able to discover him.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
