Chapter 3630 – Try Me

Someone barged into the Sleepless City!

Everyone in the hall stared at the messenger in shock.

“How many people attacked the city?!” Ye Ye’s expression sank.

“Just… Just one! It’s a youngster from the Human Race!”

Youngster from the Human Race?!

Everyone in the hall stared at each other as an awkward silence filled the area. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ye Ye opened the dao mirror in the grand hall and they saw a youngster strolling into the Sleepless City. Not a single guard could stop the man, and all of them were sent flying by a formless energy when they approached.

Wu Qifeng and Ye Jingyu gaped in shock when they saw the person in the dao mirror. “It’s him!”

Their reactions caused Ye Ye and Wu Xin to stare at them in bewilderment.

“Do you know him?” Wu Xin asked Wu Qifeng when he saw the animated expression on the latter’s face.

“Lord Ancestor, that’s the Blue Dragon Young Master!” Wu Qifeng didn’t dare to hesitate as he quickly made the report.

Ye Ye was equally as confused. In the past, Ye Jingyu entered the Limitless Celestial Empire and reported the fact that Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua had submitted to a youngster. He was curious about their relationship, but he wasn’t too concerned.

Wu Tianyu looked at Huang Xiaolong and he frowned, “What do you think he’s trying to do?”

The Blue Dragon Young Master definitely knew that there were countless experts residing in the Sleepless City. Even so, he decided to attack the city alone!

What in the world was he up to?!

Wu Tianyu and the various experts in the hall were clueless as to Huang Xiaolong’s intentions.

Wu Xin looked at Ye Ye and muttered, “Brother Ye, how strong do you think he is?”

“His strength hasn’t crossed the 14 billion units mark!” Ye Ye declared after observing Huang Xiaolong.

He was right. The strength Huang Xiaolong displayed hadn’t crossed the 14 billion units mark. After all, he only used two great worlds.

Wu Xin nodded his head and muttered, “He probably has a little more than 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy. However, it’s not possible for him to subdue Zhou Chi if that was the case…”

“Father, there might be a supreme overlord supporting the kid!” Wu Tianyu guessed. “That should be the reason behind his subordinates’ obedience…”

Ye Ye frowned and looked at the patriarch of the Jade Whale Race. “Patriarch Bi Chengyin, teach him a lesson! If he doesn’t know what’s good for him, teach him a lesson he will never forget!”

Getting to his feet, Bi Chengyin bowed before leaving the hall.

Wu Xin looked at Bi Chengyin who was headed for Huang Xiaolong and he laughed, “Patriarch Bi has already broken through the 16 billion units mark. Brother Ye is fortunate to have such a capable general!”

Ye Ye chuckled in amusement, “Brother Wu Xin, there’s no need to be envious of me. You have a ton of experts under you too…”

The two of them laughed casually.

Opening their dao eyes, the two of them decided to watch the upcoming battle.

In a few steps, Bi Chengyin arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

By the time he arrived, Huang Xiaolong had already entered the inner city.

Yu Xiaohong and the others didn’t follow him during his assault on the Sleepless City as they would be nothing more than a burden to him during the final battle. They were no match for the Limitless Master or the king of the Ocean Race anyway! Huang Xiaolong felt that they would be better off supporting the formation on the outside, preventing anyone from getting away.

When Bi Chengyin stood before Huang Xiaolong, he touched his chin and growled, “Were you the one who crippled Bi Shifei?”

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong grinned. “Are you the second strongest expert of the Sleepless Sea?”

“If you cripple one of your arms now, you can leave.” Bi Chengyin muttered. “The Sleepless City isn’t somewhere you can come and go as you please.”

“What if I refuse?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.

“Then it won’t end with you losing one of your arms. If you refuse to heed my advice, you’re going to suffer a miserable death.”

“Try me.” Huang Xiaolong said as he took a step forward.

Under the gaze of everyone in the hall, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Bi Chengyin.

With his expression sinking, Bi Chengyin growled, “Do you really think that I’ll spare you because of the courage you’ve shown?! I detest delusional kids like you!”

After he spoke, he made his move.

He appeared before Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye as he grabbed at Huang Xiaolong’s arms. Since the youngster before him wasn’t willing to listen to his warnings, he would cripple both his arms! It would count as a small lesson.

He managed to grab Huang Xiaolong’s arms without much difficulty.

Tightening his fists, he wanted to tear Huang Xiaolong’s arms off his shoulders. However, he soon discovered that he wasn’t able to do a thing to the youngster before him! Huang Xiaolong’s arms were like massive rods made from the strongest of universe materials! His hands actually hurt from squeezing too hard!

He stared at Huang Xiaolong as confusion filled his mind.

How in the world could someone refine their body to such a terrifying degree?!

In the main hall, Ye Ye and Wu Xin were equally dumbstruck.

“What’s going on?! Did he wear some sort of pseudo universe treasure level armor?!”

As the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong moved. The second strongest expert of the Sleepless Sea, Bi Chengyin, was sent flying when Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders once. Blood sprayed out from his lips.

“What?!”

No matter who it was, they failed to contain their shock.

Wu Xin and Ye Ye leaped to their feet as their expressions changed drastically.

Staring at each other, they took a single step and appeared before Huang Xiaolong.

The experts who were in the hall followed closely behind.

“Do you have any business in my Sleepless City?” Ye Ye growled. “Who are you anyway?”

“Aren’t all of you looking for the Three Gods Halberd?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.

Wu Xin and Ye Ye frowned.

Did someone leak the news of the universe treasure?!

“You must be mistaken.” Ye Ye explained in a low voice, “I invited Brother Wu Xin here to discuss matters between my Ocean Race and his Human Race.”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong laughed and summoned the Three Gods Halberd.
