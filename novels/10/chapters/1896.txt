No one had expected Huo Liucheng to flee towards Zhao Rou and Chen Qin. However, in an instant, everyone understood his intentions.

Indeed, Huo Liucheng urgently pleaded as he dashed towards Zhao Rou and Chen Qin, “Princess Zhao Rou, Senior Chen Qin, save me!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother stopping him.

In the blink of an eye, Huo Liucheng arrived beside the two of them.

Zhao Rou frowned at the turn of events. Initially, she had planned not to interfere with this matter, but now that Huo Liucheng had openly asked her and the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire for help, she could no longer sit by idly.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Zhao Rou, Chen Qin, and the rest.

The experts of the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire tensed up, and their aura locked onto Huang Xiaolong. If Huang Xiaolong wanted to make a move on their princess, they would not hesitate to attack him.

Even Chen Qin couldn’t help but stare nervously at the two ice dragons beside Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Huo Liucheng was startled when he saw Huang Xiaolong walking over, he forced himself to calm down when he thought about the numerous experts from the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire around him.

Even though he wasn’t very close to Zhao Rou, their countries were somewhat related. He was extremely sure that Zhao Rou wouldn’t sit back and do nothing if Huang Xiaolong tried to kill him.

Huang Xiaolong arrived somewhere around ten meters in front of Zhao Rou and the others.

Zhao Rou muttered, “Young master, even though Prince Huo Liucheng is in the wrong, he has already received his punishment. As the saying goes, it’s better to squash enmity than to keep it alive. How about ending the matter here?”

Everyone then turned towards Huang Xiaolong.

When almost everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong would take a step back, he shook his head, “I have already given him two chances. No one will be able to save him now.”

Everyone was dumbfounded! He actually rejected Zhao Rou!?

Who was Zhao Rou? She was the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire’s princess and was the most favored Dual Head Devil Dragon Emperor’s daughter! Her talent was superb, and she was the ranked number two beauty of the Kingdom of Devil Beasts! There was also a possibility of her rising to the Empress of the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire’s position!

However, Huang Xiaolong had actually refused her!

All the Dual Head Devil Dragon Empire’s ancestors were startled, and their expressions turned unsightly.

What type of person was their princess? To think that someone would refuse her when she had pleaded for mercy on behalf of the other party.

At this time, Huo Liucheng sneered, “Brat, I don’t believe that you would dare to kill me! Do you really think that you can go against the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire?!”

If Huang Xiaolong wanted to kill him after Zhao Rou had asked him to stop, he would be slapping the Dual Head Devil Dragon Empire’s face!

Chen Qin then berated Huang Xiaolong, “Youngster, you must leave a way out for yourself when you do things. Don’t think that you are invincible simply because you have a few strong subordinates. It’s still not too late for you to take a step back now.”

There were plenty of warnings in his words.

Huang Xiaolong had openly refused Zhao Rou and ignored her. Chen Qin felt the rage boiling in his heart.

With Zhao Rou’s identity, if she asked for something, not even an Emperor Realm expert from an empire can ignore her.

“What if I refuse to take a step back?” Huang Xiaolong said indifferently.

Chen Qin and everyone felt their jaws dropping to the ground.

Who was Chen Qin? He was the right-hand man of the Dual Head Devil Dragon Great Emperor! He had already warned Huang Xiaolong, but the youngster before him refused to take a step back no matter what!

“Fine, let me have a taste of your Ice Dragons’ frigid qi!” A brilliant light flashed through Chen Qin’s eyes as he raised his head to roar towards the heavens. His aura climbed, and it was as though an ancient chaos beast had awakened.

In reality, Chen Qin’s original body was actually a giant beast called Floating Star Beast. He could command the energy of the stars, and he swallowed the light from heavenly objects to cultivate.

Huang Xiaolong said calmly, “What if you lose?”

Chen Qin was startled and turned towards Zhao Rou. Her beautiful eyes flickered, and she spoke for Chen Qin, “If Chen Qin loses against you, we won’t interfere with this matter any further.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

If someone like Chen Qin were to lose, Zhao Rou wouldn’t be able to save Huo Liucheng even if she wanted to.

At that time, the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire would have nothing to say even if Zhao Rou washed her hands off the matter. If the strongest expert in her group from the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire lost at the hands of a youngster, no one would be able to save Huo Liucheng.

Of course, Zhao Rou had absolute confidence in Chen Qin’s ability.

Even though there were two ice dragons hovering beside Huang Xiaolong, Chen Qin was sure that he could take them both on.

“Alright!” Huang Xiaolong said with a face full of indifference.

Chen Qin walked out slowly and looked at the two ice dragons beside Huang Xiaolong. “I’ll let your ice dragons take the first move.”

Starlight appeared all over his body, and it was as if a vast starry sky had materialized behind him.

Starlight continuously poured out from within the void and fell onto Chen Qin’s body. The brilliance of the starlight illuminated the entire Thousand Constellation Mountain Range.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “One of them is more than enough to defeat.”

Chen Qin’s face turned cold when he heard this. This brat actually dares to underestimate me?! He was confident of taking them both down, even if the two dragons were to attack him at the same time. Right now, Huang Xiaolong had said that he was only planning to send out a single ice dragon to defeat him! If that wasn’t an insult, he didn’t know what was.

It was too bad an icy light appeared behind Huang Xiaolong before Chen Qin could react.

Everyone’s eyes widened in surprise as they saw another ice dragon appear beside Huang Xiaolong! Moreover, based on the aura that it was giving off, it was even stronger than the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm ice dragon from earlier!

“This... peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm!” Chen Qin stuttered.

Zhao Rao and the surrounding experts felt a bomb going off in their heads.

It’s a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm ice dragon!

Didn’t Chen Qin say that Huang Xiaolong would only be able to control two ice dragons?!

Chen Qin’s face turned ugly. He had never thought that Huang Xiaolong would bring out another ice dragon, much less one at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

Of course, if he knew that Huang Xiaolong had over seventy ice dragons, with thirty of them being Tenth Order Emperors, he might have even fainted on the spot.

After summoning the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm ice dragon, Huang Xiaolong commanded, “Go.”

Without the slightest delay, the ice dragon charged towards Chen Qin.

Huang Xiaolong, Lu Xiaoqing, and everyone else retreated.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded in the air, and the entire Thousand Constellation Mountain Range shook violently. The battle had begun!

In the battle, the mountain peaks were split apart, and everyone in the surrounding countries felt endless rumbling coming from the ground under them.

Half an hour later, both parties stopped. Chen Qin’s limbs had already turned into ice sculptures as he fell to the ground.

Chen Qin had fallen!

Although Chen Qin’s combat strength was extremely formidable, it was still quite far off from the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm ice dragon.

Seeing Chen Qin’s defeat, Huo Liucheng’s face changed, and he tried to turn around to escape without anyone noticing. As soon as he turned around, he was immediately stopped by Huang Xiaolong.

Just as Huo Liucheng was about to speak, a figure blurred, and Huo Liucheng’s body stiffened. His head separated from his neck, and his body began turning into small light particles that dissipated between heaven and earth.
