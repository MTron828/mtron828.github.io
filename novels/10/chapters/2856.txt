Chapter 2857: The Stake Is Too Small

A thought flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s mind, and he took the initiative to approach the young man. Huang Xiaolong stood in front of Wang Xin, and he was full of mockery as he spoke, “In other words, you’re the biggest expert around, aren't you? Why don’t you make a bet with me?”

Wang Xin and the disciples from the other sacred lands were startled.

No one had expected Huang Xiaolong to propose to make a bet with Wang Xin, that too, in a taunting tone!

“Brat, who do you think you are? Are you qualified to make a bet with our Senior Brother Wang Xin?!” a disciple behind Wang Xin yelled grumpily and pointed at Huang Xiaolong, “F*ck off, or I’ll break your legs!”

This disciple was a Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong coldly glanced at the Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple.

However, Wang Xin waved his hand at the outer disciple, and then looked at Huang Xiaolong with interest. “Not bad. You’ve got guts to make a bet with me. Speak, what do you want to bet on? And how do you want to bet?”

Huang Xiaolong spoke tepidly, “Since you think you’re an expert in stone guessing, then we’ll compete in stone guessing. Both of us will simply choose one jade stone, and see who gets a jade stone with a higher grade embryo. If you lose, you’ll admit that you’re an idiot in public a hundred times. You will also break the legs of that dog-slave of yours!”

“What?!” Everyone was dumbfounded.

No one had expected Huang Xiaolong to put forward these kinds of conditions.

Yell loudly that he’s an idiot?! A hundred times?!

This had gone beyond provoking Wang Xin.

The gazes from experts all around looking at Huang Xiaolong had long turned strange. There’s actually someone who dares to show hostility to Wang Xin. Isn’t this looking to die early?

“Little mongrel, you’re seeking death!”

The Dragon Fish Creed outer disciple behind Wang Xin was enraged being called a dog-slave by Huang Xiaolong. Not to mention, if Wang Xing lost the bet, Wang Xin would have to break his legs. His eyes were bursting with killing intent.

But just as the Dragon Fish Creed outer disciple was about to attack, Wang Xin reached out and stopped him.

Wang Xin looked at Huang Xiaolong, and the smile on his face was long gone. “Fine, I’ll bet with you. However, if you lose, you will have to say that you are an idiot ten thousand times, and you’ll also break your own legs, as well as the legs of the two dog-slaves behind you!”

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng’s expressions turned frosty immediately.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, and he agreed, “Agreed. However, the stake is too small, so let’s add ten billion Tuoshen holy coins!”

“What?! Ten billion Tuoshen holy coins?!” the surrounding experts exclaimed.

Ten billion Tuoshen holy coins was an amount many sacred lands’ young patriarchs couldn’t take out.

Wang Xin was stunned.

“What is it? A prestigious Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple like you can’t take out ten billion Tuoshen holy coins?” Huang Xiaolong snickered, “Well, it’s fine if you don’t have ten billion Tuoshen holy coins, just leave behind everything on your body when you leave, including your clothes. Strip down to your birthday suit if you lose!”

“What?!”

The experts in the crowd became interested, with obvious anticipation.

That literally lit up the fuse of the disciples accompanying Wang Xin.

“Punk, are you certain you want to make this bet with me?” Wang Xin asked sullenly as iciness roiled in his eyes. He hadn’t expected that when merely taking a casual stroll at the Blue Lotus Creed’s trading market, he would encounter someone who dared to provoke him, the kind that seemed to seek death.

“Do you know the consequences of your action?” Wang Xin did not conceal his murderous aura.

Yet, Huang Xiaolong continued to mock, “I estimate that everything on you is only worth a few hundred million Tuoshen holy coins compared to the ten billion Tuoshen holy coins that I put out. You still don’t dare to take the bet?! Or you’re merely a fool and a waste. You don’t have the guts to bet, knowing that you won’t be able to beat me.”

Wang Xin’s anger had reached a peak by the time Huang Xiaolong finished, “D*mn you!” And a powerful force shot at Huang Xiaolong from his finger.

The finger force tore through space.

Wang Xin was an early Seventh Heaven Primal Ancestor, a high-level Primal Ancestor expert.

When Wang Xin’s finger force was less than a meter from Huang Xiaolong’s face, Duan Feng punched out with his fist. An enormous fist appeared in the air, and collided with Wang Xin’s finger force. A blast rang and Wang Xin’s finger force dissipated.

The result dumbfounded the crowd.

“Divination God Fist!”

Wang Xin stared at Duan Feng in astonishment.

“What?! Divination God Fist, the Divination Creed’s grand dao art?!”

Upon hearing Wang Xin’s exclamation, the crowd was in a furor, and their faces paled, including the Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples behind Wang Xin.

“You’re a Divination Creed’s inner disciple?” Wang Xin’s astonished eyes were locked onto Duan Feng.

Divination Creed’s grand dao art at the level of Divination Fist was not something an outer disciple could learn. Hence, that could only mean that Duan Feng was a Divination Creed’s inner disciple.

“Correct,” Duan Feng admitted coldly as he and Long Jianfei stood respectfulyl behind Huang Xiaolong.

At Duan Feng’s admission that he was a Divination Creed’s inner disciple, the various sacred lands’ disciples and experts now looked at Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng in a new light.

Only complicated expressions remained on the Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciples’ faces, who had clamored behind Wang Xin and scolded Huang Xiaolong and his group that they were unqualified to bet with Senior Brother Wang Xin.

The murderous-looking Wang Xin suppressed his killing intent in an instant as he took another look at Huang Xiaolong. Doubt and suspicion flickered across his eyes.

Clearly, he was inwardly trying to guess Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

“Who are you?” Wang Xin asked solemnly and there was an obvious change in his tone.

Huang Xiaolong let out a derisive snort, “What? Scared to bet? Or have you got no confidence in your rubbish bloodline? Why don’t you just admit you’re garbage?”

Wang Xin’s face and faces of the disciples behind him were distorted with anger.

“Aren’t you being too arrogant? It’s wiser not to step on other’s bottom line,” Wang Xin warned gloomily.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, if Wang Xin had not recognized Duan Feng as a Divination Creed’s inner disciple, he would have definitely had a different response.

“Since you’re scared to bet with me, then f*ck out of the way with your bunch of slaves. Don’t disturb me from opening these stones.”

By opening stones, it meant that one would shave off the surface of selected stones layer by layer until they determined if there was an embryo in the stone the buyer had selected.

Most people liked to open stones on the spot after buying jade stones.

After hearing Huang Xiaolong tell him to f*ck out of the way, and insulting him again and again, the killing intent that Wang Xin had barely managed to suppress erupted out of control.

“Fine, I’ll bet with you!” Wang Xin’s bloodshot eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong, “According to the stakes you’ve mentioned!”

As a Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple, and Zhu Hui’s named disciple on top of that, his bloodline was naturally not weak. In fact, his bloodline ranked very high!

Not to mention, apart from the bloodline, one also required skills in stone guessing! He had dabbled in stone guessing for many years and was very experienced. He had been praised by many Dao Venerables because of this. Therefore, he didn't believe he would lose.

Despite knowing full well that Huang Xiaolong had deliberately stimulated him, he still decided to bet with Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled coldly, then called for the shop owner to be the judge for his bet with Wang Xin.

After that, Huang Xiaolong and Wang Xin began selecting jade stones.
