By tradition, every term of the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition was held in the Royal Pill City.

Hearing the Ascending Moon Old Man saying that they would depart almost immediately, Huang Xiaolong felt it was too abrupt, “We’re departing right after this?”

The Ascending Moon Old Man once again fumed with rage, “Then do you want to wait until the competition begins one month later before going there?”

Huang Xiaolong flashed a cunning grin, “Old man, you have that move, Greater Space Shift, right? We’ll reach there in time with just one Greater Space Shift.”

The Ascending Moon Old Man made an act of scolding Huang Xiaolong, “I already guessed that you kid want to take advantage of this, do you think space shifting is like cracking peanuts? Easily teleporting from Golden Dragon Peak all the way to the Royal Pill City? This time we’ll be flying the entire way. Now, quickly go get ready!”

Huang Xiaolong only mentioned it casually, he knew that using space teleportation consumed a great amount of godforce.

Exiting the hall, Huang Xiaolong went to inform his parents and the others that he’d be heading to the Royal Pill City with the Ascending Moon Old Man for the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition, and that he would probably return three months later.

But, Shi Xiaofei wanted to go with Huang Xiaolong.

The Ascending Moon Old Man looked at Shi Xiaofei, “Why, are you reluctant to part with your sweetheart even for a few months?”

A crimson blush instantly colored Shi Xiaofei’s face.

“It’s fine, you can tag along with Xiaolong, gaining some experience is good for you,” the Ascending Moon Old Man said seriously. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Shi Xiaofei was more than happy after getting the Ascending Moon Old Man’s permission. The truth was, she heard Huang Xiaolong mention that the Vermillion Bird Institute’s He Feifan would also be participating in the competition, hence, her main motive for tagging along was to ask He Feifan about her Master, Yang Yi.

Several years had passed, yet there was no news of her Master.

However, the Ascending Moon Old Man spoke again, “You’re worried about your Master, right? Actually, your Master is alright, but because of some issues, she couldn’t come back from the Vermillion Bird Galaxy right now.”

Both Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were stunned. The Ascending Moon Old Man actually had news of Yang Yi. Huang Xiaolong was especially surprised.

Relief washed over Shi Xiaofei, and it clearly showed on her face, “Senior Ascending, you’re saying that my Master is alright?”

The old man laughed and nodded, “Since when has this old man lied to my disciple-in-law?”

This ‘disciple-in-law’ easily made Shi Xiaofei blush again, but after confirming with the Ascending Moon Old Man that her Master was alright, the worry in her heart finally disappeared. Although the Ascending Moon Old Man had reassured her that her Master was doing fine, Shi Xiaofei still decided to follow Huang Xiaolong to Royal Pill City.

Hence, the three were sent off by the Huang Family as they left the Golden Dragon Peak.

Despite the fact that space teleportation consumed a large amount of godforce, the Ascending Moon Old Man still brought Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei from the Golden Dragon Peak to the Black Warrior City’s transmission array using Greater Space Shift.

The Royal Pill City wasn’t built within any of the four galaxies. Instead, it was located in a constellation where the Black Tortoise, Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, and White Tiger Galaxies intersected.

From the Black Warrior City’s transmission array, the three of them transferred more than thirty times before arriving at a Black Tortoise Galaxy world surface called West Crow World.

This West Crow World was the westernmost location in the Black Tortoise Galaxy that was closest to Royal Pill City. Coming out from the West Crow World’s transmission array, the Ascending Moon Old Man, Huang Xiaolong, and Shi Xiaofei headed to Royal Pill City by flight.

Because Shi Xiaofei was with them, their flying speed was much slower. Then again, according to the Ascending Moon Old Man, based on their current speed, they should be able to reach the Royal Pill City in twenty days, right on schedule.

“Old man, since the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s headquarters is in Royal Pill City, and moreover, the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition has always taken place there, why is there no transmission array in the Royal Pill City?” On the way, Huang Xiaolong asked the most obvious question. Logically speaking, it was impossible that the Alchemist Grandmaster Association couldn’t afford to build a transmission array with its wealth.

The Ascending Moon Old Man rolled his eyes and retorted, “You ask this old man, but who should I ask?”

“Aren’t you the only Special Rank Alchemist of the association? How could you not know?” Huang Xiaolong obviously didn’t believe the old man.

The Ascending Moon Old Man was quiet for some time before speaking, “In truth, there was a transmission array inside the Royal Pill City in the past, but sixty thousand years ago, the Royal Pill City’s transmission array was destroyed!”

“Destroyed?!” Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei exclaimed in astonishment.

Who was it that dared to destroy the Royal Pill City’s transmission array!

Not even a Highgod Realm master such as the Azure Dragon Institute Principal would be reckless enough to destroy the Royal Pill City’s transmission array! One must know, the consequences of this act were equivalent to thoroughly offending the Alchemist Grandmaster Association.

“Destroyed by who?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t resist asking, being morbidly curious about that person’s identity.

But, all of a sudden, the Ascending Moon Old Man became extremely irritated, “Why are you asking so many questions? If you want to know, go find out yourself later!” His old face sank as if recalling something unpleasant.

Watching the old man’s reaction, Huang Xiaolong was even more curious.

Who was it that destroyed the Royal Pill City’s transmission array? It was obvious that the old man knew, but why was he refusing to speak of it? Huang Xiaolong was tactful enough and did not continue pestering the old man.

The group of three continued flying at high speed in space as planets grew smaller and disappeared behind them as time passed.

It was a smooth journey the whole way.

After speaking of the Royal Pill City’s destroyed transmission array, the Ascending Moon Old Man was much more silent and reserved the rest of the journey. Huang Xiaolong was more comfortable this way, if the Ascending Moon Old Man had chattered the entire way, he wasn’t sure that he would be able to remain sane.

Very soon, twenty days passed.

The three of them arrived at the radiant stretch of a constellation.

Both Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofeu were awestruck looking at the majestic city hovering among the stars in front of them.

This larger than life city that stretched further than the eyes could see, its size bigger than a mainland, was the Royal Pill City?!

Before arriving, Huang Xiaolong knew that the Royal Pill City would not be small, but the city in front of his eyes had far surpassed his imagination! How was this ‘not small’, this was literally...! Huang Xiaolong was at a loss for a word to describe what he was seeing.

How many of these tall undulating palaces and towers were there? A hundred thousand, or millions?! How tall was that city wall that pierced into the clouds above? A thousand zhang, or above ten thousand zhang?!

“What, startled?” Watching the expression on their faces, the Ascending Moon Old Man showed a triumphant grin as if this Royal Pill City belonged to him.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were indeed startled.

“Come on, let’s go down and find a good inn with a restaurant and feed our stomachs with some delicious food.” the Ascending Moon Old Man declared sonorously, “The Royal Pill City’s Royal Pill Wine is the genuine stuff!” Not waiting for Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei to react, the old man flew down toward the Royal Pill City.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head helplessly and chased after the old man with Shi Xiaofei.

Coming closer to the Royal Pill City, the city seemed even bigger in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Surrounding the city were nebulous clusters, and above the city itself were stars emitting a soft glow, projecting a kind of surreal beauty.

After another two hours of flight, Huang Xiaolong’s group of three finally reached the Royal Pill City.

Standing before the city, staring at the enormous city gates that were ten kilometers wide, Huang Xiaolong suddenly felt that humans were no different than ants.

After paying three hundred saint grade spiritual pellets, the three of them stepped into the Royal Pill City.

Rich spiritual energy mingling with a faint medicinal fragrance rushed over Huang Xiaolong.
