Chapter 2219: So This is Where the Six Eyed Ice Lion is Hiding!

Even though ordinary people would find it hard to harvest these origin treasures, it was a piece of cake for Huang Xiaolong.

Despite vicious beasts in the Sovereign realm protecting these origin treasures, Huang Xiaolong didn’t feel troubled in the slightest. Instead, a spark of joy flashed through his heart. He could obtain the origin treasures and subdue all the Sovereign Realm vicious beasts while he was at it! It was basically like a buy-one-get-one-free offer!

Ten days later...

The treasury of the Radiance Chamber of Commerce added eight origin treasures to their collection, and there were five divine beasts beside Huang Xiaolong.

The five divine beasts Huang Xiaolong obtained were like the Phoenix Eagle Huang Xiaolong had subdued previously. They all possessed the ice attribute. After adding them all up, there were six divine beasts by Huang Xiaolong’s side. Moreover, not a single one of them were low-level Sovereigns. The weakest was at the Fourth Order Sovereign Realm, and the strongest was the Six Eyed Ice Lion at the peak of the late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm!

Even though it was only at the peak of the late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm, its battle prowess was comparable to an early-Seventh Order Sovereign.

It was the beast that was protecting the mid-grade, level-two origin treasure that Huang Xiaolong had set his eyes on. This origin treasure was called the Dark Yin Flower.

In order to subdue the Six Eyed Ice Lion, Huang Xiaolong nearly exhausted himself. Not only did he employ all three complete dao saint godheads’ power, but he even activated all three saint bloodlines! Huang Xiaolong finally managed to suppress the Six Eyed Ice Lion by calling for the help of all the other divine beasts!

As soon as Huang Xiaolong succeeded in his attempt to tame the lion, he realized that the deeper he went, the stronger the beasts he would face. Giving up on his search for more origin treasures, Huang Xiaolong decided to return to the Radiance Chamber of Commerce to refine the treasures stored in the treasury before doing anything else.

After his adventures, the number of origin treasurers stored in the treasury rose to ten. Huang Xiaolong knew that he would regain a huge part of his strength after he refined all of them. Running into a peak late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm beast would no longer be as dangerous as it once was! As he stepped closer and closer to his peak form, he would be able to deal with existences like the Six Eyed Ice Lion easily.

Entering a mountain cave deep within the peak of a snowy mountain, Huang Xiaolong sat down and sent all six divine beasts out to guard his surroundings. He quickly laid down several restrictions at the cave entrance before retrieving all ten origin treasures.

As per usual, Huang Xiaolong decided to refine all of them at the same time.

Even though he wasn’t at his peak, he knew that refining all ten of them wouldn’t be a problem.

Huang Xiaolong swallowed the Lightning Snow Grass, Dark Yin Flower, and several other origin treasures one by one. They quickly turned into streaks of origin energy that flowed through his body.

Circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, the three complete dao saint godheads appeared and started to refine the strands of origin energy flowing through his body.

With the appearance of the three complete dao saint godheads, strands of holy spiritual qi poured down from the void as they entered Huang Xiaolong’s body.

A resplendent glow soon enveloped Huang Xiaolong.

As light covered his body, traces of black qi poured out from the pores of his body. The black qi that emerged wasn’t darkness energy that Huang Xiaolong could use, and neither was it something he could absorb to aid in his cultivation. Instead, the black qi that was forced out from Huang Xiaolong’s body seemed extremely foul.

When Huang Xiaolong had forced his way through the lightning storm, he had suffered from serious injuries from the destructive lightning qi. The lightning flame that was part of the lightning bolts that struck Huang Xiaolong had hidden itself in his body. The black qi that was forced out was precisely that.

Huang Xiaolong was never able to force them out with his weakened cultivation and now that he could, he knew that his cultivation would soon return to its peak state.

Time slowly passed and the skies slowly darkened.

Stars twinkled in the night sky and as moonlight fell on the land, the icy forest was painted with a light silvery glow.

The silver light accentuated the pure white snow, and it seemed to emit a soft radiance.

An uneventful night passed and by the time the sun rose again, black qi was pouring out from Huang Xiaolong’s body non-stop.

Warm rays of light from the sun illuminated the lands and as snow-flakes fluttered about in the wind, the brilliant rays of light reflected off them. It seemed as though they were tiny blue stars flickering in space as they fell slowly to the ground.

The Six Eyed Ice Lion surveyed the surroundings around the mountain peak, watching out for any abnormalities.

Suddenly, it leaped to its feet as an icy light shot out from its eyes.

The five other divine beasts jumped in unison as they turned their gaze to look at the horizon.

A group of experts, who was wearing scarlet battle robes, speedily charged through the space to surround the mountain peak.

Each and every one of them wore a scarlet battle robe with the words ‘Ancient Incineration’ embroidered on their chests. The words emitted a tyrannical vibe and battle intent rolled off their bodies.

“Look! It’s a Six Eyed Ice Lion!”

One of them yelled out in surprise.

“Who would have thought that a Six Eyed Ice Lion would hide itself!”

The reason for their appearance in the icy forest was to kill a Six Eyed Ice Lion. They wanted to use the six eyes of the lion to refine a certain innate spiritual pill.

“Hey! Other than the Six Eyed Ice Lion, there’s a Phoenix Eagle, Giant Horned Ice Locust, the Yin and Yang Serpent, Black Earth Bear, and a Nine Headed Snow Toad!”

When they discovered the other divine beasts, the experts were shocked. Divine beasts at their level wouldn’t choose to gather together.

Of course, none of them placed the other five beasts in their eyes. Even if the five beasts joined forces, they wouldn’t be able to match up to the Six Eyed Ice Lion. They had brought more than twenty members along, and they were confident of killing the Six Eyed Ice Lion. Even if they added the five divine beasts into the mix, it was but a little more effort. They were extremely confident in taking all six beasts down and they didn’t hesitate to start their attack.

“Wait! There’s someone here!”

One of them managed to notice the fluctuations in origin energy in the mountain peak behind the Six Eyed Ice Lion.

“It seems like he has managed to subdue all six beasts... Is he a Beast Master or is he an expert from the Beast Emperor Sect?”

The Beast Emperor Sect was one of the superpowers in the Falling Jade Dynasty. Even though they weren’t comparable to the Big Dipper Sword Sect, or the other supreme sects, they were still a monstrous existence. When all was said and done, they had a half-step Venerable as their patriarch!

“Humph... So what if he’s someone from the Beast Emperor Sect? We came under the orders of the grand hall master! We have to obtain the eyes of the Six Eyed Ice Lion no matter the cost! Without them, we won’t be able to refine the Six Flames Ice Reversal Divine Pill! If the grand hall master rages, everyone will suffer! We have to kill the Six Eyed Ice Lion no matter what!”

“Who cares about the Beast Emperor Sect? Just kill it! If the other five beasts dare to obstruct us, we’ll kill them too! I haven’t eaten the meat of a Black Earth Bear in a long time! You guys know how delicious the meat of a Black Earth Bear is, right?”

“Form up! Everyone, move out!”

In an instant, the sounds of battle echoed through the air as the mountain range started to shake.

A flurry of ice and snow-filled the air as destructive might swept through the lands.

Luckily for Huang Xiaolong, he had remembered to set up restrictions around the entrance of the cave. No matter how strong the shockwaves of the battle were, they were stopped before they could affect him.

Of course, the restrictions wouldn’t be able to hold forever. As the battle raged on outside, the shockwaves battered against his restrictions and they started to dim. In less than an hour, they would be completely destroyed!

Half an hour passed just like that.

The air around Huang Xiaolong started to tremble as the light around his body burst out in all directions. An enormous aura expanded to fill the space around the mountain range as he turned into a streak of light that emerged from the cave. Without a care in the world, Huang Xiaolong sent out a punch into the space in front of him.

A loud cry rang through the air when Huang Xiaolong’s fist arrived in front of one of the other party’s members.

The other party felt his inner organs churning as he was forced to retreat. He couldn’t help but stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Huang Xiaolong stopped in midair and turned to look at his divine beasts. He could see that they were exhausted as the Six Eyed Ice Lion and Phoenix Eagle had suffered from the most serious injuries. Half of the lion’s body was charred and two of the Phoenix Eagle’s wings were broken.
