When they heard how the Reverence Moon Old Man declared Huang Xiaolong as the leader of the Radiance World, their faces paled. There was no need to mention the fact that the old man had ordered them to listen to Huang Xiaolong.

Even though the Reverence Moon Old Man hadn’t appeared before the world in the past several hundred million years, no one doubted his authority. His words were like an imperial edict in the Radiance World. In fact, his orders used to hold more weight than the Radiance Ancestor in the past.

Now that he was openly supporting Huang Xiaolong, there was no doubt that it was a matter of time before the power of the Radiance World shifted. Those churches who didn’t know which side they wanted to stand on would definitely gather to support Huang Xiaolong.

Bai Hui, Bin Ge, and the others refused to acknowledge the old man’s order. In an instant, boundless might emerged from the depths of the Reverence Moon Academy, and a crushing pressure descended on Reverence Moon Divine City.

In that instant, everyone who failed to leave felt a horrifying weight pressing down on them.

“Who?! That’s a Sovereign’s will! Could it be that deputy directors Bin Ge and Bai Hui are making a move?!” Qin Huangzhong looked at one of the ancestors beside him and exclaimed in shock.

The ancestor was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. He was about to break through at any time, and ordinary Sovereign’s will wouldn’t be able to stop him. It was a shame the Sovereign’s will belonged to the Reverence Moon Old Man. Before the horrifying pressure, he felt no bigger than an ant.

Since the strongest person in their party was suppressed, there was no need to mention the other ancestors. When the Reverence Moon Old Man’s Sovereign’s will covered the city, every single Emperor Realm cultivator was forced to their knees. A look of desperation flashed across their faces, and it felt as though someone was grabbing their soul, intending to tear it apart.

“Bai Hui, Bin Ge, Bai Luo, Ban Ke, did I make myself clear? If this happens again, I’ll break both your legs! From now on, Huang Xiaolong’s orders are my orders! After receiving the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance, Huang Xiaolong is now the Radiance World’s leader! His status will be no lower than mine!” The Reverence Moon Old Man’s voice resounded through the air. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Previously, the Reverence Moon Old Man had only allowed everyone surrounding Huang Xiaolong to listen in on their conversation. However, he no longer bothered hiding Huang Xiaolong’s identity the second time he spoke. His voice resounded through the Reverence Moon Divine City, into the ears of everyone present.

“It’s the Reverence Moon Old Man!” When the ancestor beside Qin Huangzhong heard the voice, his heart skipped a beat, and he stuttered anxiously.

He finally realized whose Sovereign’s will he was facing!

It was the Reverence Moon Old Man!

Even though the news of the Reverence Moon Old Man reappearing in the world had started to spread, everyone had felt a little suspicious as none of them had seen the old man in person.

Right now, their doubts were cleared.

Everyone felt their hearts pounding in their chests.

The Reverence Moon Old Man was standing on Huang Xiaolong’s side! There was no doubt about it.

The Reverence Moon Old Man didn’t intend to let everyone off so easily. Instead, the pressure he exerted on them increased again. With the mountain-like pressure crushing down on them, the four deputy deans were flattened against the ground. The Reverence Moon Old Man’s sovereign’s will was like countless ancient mountain ranges pressing down on them. They could hear crackling and popping sounds coming from their bones.

“Old... Old Dean, we will obey your order!” Bai Hui was finally unable to endure it, and he yelled, “From now on, we will listen to Huang Xiaolong! He shall be no less important than you!”

Waves of terror rose in his heart. As a mid-Second Order Sovereign, he was no weakling. However, the Reverence Moon Old Man had managed to suppress him with just his will!

Could it be that the Reverence Moon Old Man has already stepped into the high-level Sovereign Realm?! Did he become the second high-level Sovereign in all the worlds?!

Bin Ge’s thoughts mirrored Bai Hui’s. Even though he was weaker than Bai Hui, it only served to amplify the fear he had for the Reverence Moon Old Man.

After Bai Hui responded, the three of them realized that it was no use trying to resist. In the end, they agreed to whatever the Reverence Moon Old Man said.

Gu Ting hastily forced his lips open to openly praise the Reverence Moon Old Man to prove his loyalty.

“Good!” Even though it seemed as though the Reverence Moon Old Man’s anger had dissipated, a hidden killing intent lingered in the air. He was ready to kill anyone who wanted to remain stubborn. As long as they were unwilling to take Huang Xiaolong as their new leader, the Reverence Moon Old Man was prepared to kill all of them in order to pave the way for Huang Xiaolong.

Feeling the lingering killing intent in the air, the four deputy directors felt cold sweat dripping down their forehead. They were clear that they had managed to escape from a calamity.

Like a receding tide, the Reverence Moon Old Man’s Sovereign’s will returned to the Reverence Moon Academy. The feeling of suppression disappeared suddenly, and it was as though color returned to the lives of everyone present in the Reverence Moon Divine City. They felt as though they had managed to crawl back from the gates of hell.

Only after several minutes did the four deputy directors struggle to their feet. A complicated look filled their faces as they stared at Huang Xiaolong. Regardless of how angry or indignant they felt, they had no choice but to suppress the feeling and hide the look of resentment they had.

“World Lord... “ After a short hesitation, Bai Hui greeted Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing as the strongest out of them had already taken the first step, the three others stared at each other before greeting, “Lord World Leader!”

As for Gu Ting, he slowly made his way towards Huang Xiaolong with a cautious expression on his face. Forcing out a smile that had the intensity of a thousand suns, he yelled, “World Lord!”

Huang Xiaolong stared at Gu Ting for a second before slapping him across the face.

Gu Ting went reeling with a single slap from Huang Xiaolong.

After spinning a few rounds, he held his cheek as he cried out, “World Lord, you...”

“Didn’t you say that based on the rules of your Reverence Moon Divine City, you had to capture me?” Huang Xiaolong growled.

A twisted smile appeared on Gu Ting’s face, “World Lord, that... that was a misunderstanding!”

Huang Xiaolong swept a cold gaze across everyone present before turning around to leave with Ao Ping.

Bai Hui and the others stood rooted to their spot with an ugly expression on their faces. They were the ones who people sucked up to, not the other way round! They were used to the compliments, but they hardly ever gave them out. Even Dun Ei had to respect them! When had they ever suffered such ‘indignation?’

“Deputy deans, do we...” Gu Ting saw that there was no point in staying, and he quickly spoke up.

“Leave.” Bai Hui waved his arm and dismissed everyone. He was clearly irritated as he didn’t bother to pacify Gu Ting.

...

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong and Ao Ping arrived before the Radiance Flame Volcano.

Looking at the massive mountain before them, a look of shock flashed through their eyes.

The mountain really lived up to its name. As though it was formed from light itself, the mountain emitted resplendent rays of light. Bursts of flames occasionally shot out from the center of the mountain. The flames were clearly different from ordinary flames as they emitted blue, purple, green, and even red light!

“Go, I’ll wait here,” Ao Ping said.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, and he soared towards the peak of the mountain. In a flash, he disappeared.

Even though he had already accepted the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance, the heat he felt after approaching the center of the mountain made him feel as though he was placed in a boiling cauldron.

After gritting his teeth and flying for several thousand feet, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the bottom of the flames. It was a world formed from lava, and white-hot lava emitted bursts of ashen flames. It was an eye-catching sight indeed.

Huang Xiaolong wasted no time as he summoned the fourteen winged angels.

After several minutes, Ao Ping saw Huang Xiaolong reappearing. When he emerged, even his eyebrows were emitting white flames.
