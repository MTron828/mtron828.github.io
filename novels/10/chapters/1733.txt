Unexpectedly, Yang Jing looked in Huang Xiaolong’s direction at this time. Her phoenix eyes glared fiercely at him, but soon, the corners of her lips curved into a faintly mocking smile. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The mocking smile on her face did not escape Huang Xiaolong’s notice. Obviously, Yang Jing thought that Huang Xiaolong was unaware of Shi Yinyu arranging his quota into the Gate of Nine Yin through her suggestion. Maybe, Yang Jing was even under the impression that he was beyond himself with joy at this moment.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent.

The square became livelier with Yang Jing and Shi Yinyu’s arrival. Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders fawned over at Shi Yinyu and Yang Jing’s side, conversing about something.

It seemed like Yang Jing had heard some good news that she was laughing modestly, demurely covering her lips with a hand.

“The Old Ancestor and Patriarch arrive!”

Suddenly, a loud shout rang in the air.

Airflow rippled vigorously as two overwhelming pressures enveloped the square like endless giant waves crashing down on the land. These overwhelming pressures seemed to originate from a time far gone, from the heaven above.

Under these pressures, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders felt their breaths getting stuck in their chests.

Huang Xiaolong furtively glanced up and saw the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang and several Ancestors flying toward them, surrounding a massive figure.

Overpowering coercion came from the massive figure.

Startling death qi enshrouded the massive figure, blocking others from viewing his real appearance.

Shi Ming!

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor, the strongest person of Spirits World! He was the existence that had led the Spirits World to war against the Heavenly Court, the existence that had fought a world-shattering battle against the Ancient Heavenly Emperor!

Despite being mentally prepared, actually seeing Shi Ming in person sent waves of shock through Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

“Welcome, Old Ancestor! Welcome, Patriarch! Welcome, several Ancestors.”

In a moment, the Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders on the square all knelt in salute toward Shi Ming and Shi Wushuang. Shi Yinyu and Yang Jing were no exception.

Huang Xiaolong had no choice but to emulate Shi Yinyu and the others’ actions and greet Shi Ming.

“Stand up.” Shi Ming’s voice came from the dense, roiling death qi, like a scratching metal, yet loud as thunder, and inviolable.

“Thank you, Old Ancestor!”

Everyone complied respectfully before standing up on their feet.

Shi Ming moved to the center of the square. He stood in midair, in no hurry to open the Gate of Nine Yin. His gaze swept around the faces of the Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders on the square, who were about to enter the Gate of Nine Yin.

His eyes seemed to penetrate one’s soul, seeing a person’s truth.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart tightened nervously, and he converged everything about himself. He even let the heart of hell fall into temporary slumber.

After scanning a circle around the square, Shi Ming spoke, “All of you are the next generation that carries our tribe’s hope. The Gate of Nine Yin’s opening is an opportunity, I hope all of you will make full use of this opportunity, cultivate and train to your best effort in the Corpse Soul Land, improve your strengths, especially those peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Hall Masters. I hope you will seize this chance and breakthrough to the Emperor Realm! Anyone that successfully advances to the Emperor Realm will be heavily rewarded, and a glorious future awaits you!”

“Yes, Old Ancestor!”

Everyone responded in sonorous voices.

Shi Ming nodded. After that, he turned to face the other way. Two beams of light flew out from his eyes and shot into the void above the square. Almost immediately, dazzling bright lights shone in the sky. Air currents became turbulent as a colossal door opened in space and appeared before everyone’s eyes.

This was the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s most important inheritance, the Gate of Nine Yin!

Although the Gate of Nine Yin’s entrance was located at the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters, it leads to a space outside Hell.

According to Desolate Giant Tai Yue, this Nine Yin space could have been born even before Hell came into existence. It was an innate grandmist space.

Huang Xiaolong stared deeply at the Gate of Nine Yin.

There were dense swirling threads of black and gray colored energy.

...Is this soul energy?

Soul energy originated from a place called Corpse Soul Land behind the Gate of Nine Yin. It was a kind of high-quality spiritual energy. In fact, in the entire Hell, or even the universe, only the Corpse Soul Land behind the Gate of Nine Yin generated soul energy.

“Enter!” Shi Ming ordered the others and leaped through the Gate of Nine Yin ahead of the others. His massive figure vanished from sight in the blink of an eye. Shi Wushuang flew in right after Shi Ming, then it was Shi Yinyu, Yang Jing, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Emperor Realm Ancestors, Hall Masters, and finally, the Grand Elders and Elders.

Huang Xiaolong was among the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Grand Elders that leaped through the Gate of Nine Yin.

When everyone on the square had entered, the Gate of Nine Yin slowly closed on its own.

Only Shi Ming could open the Gate of Nine Yin; thus, those who had entered the Gate of Nine Yin had to wait for Shi Ming to open the Gate of Nine Yin in order to come out.

Of course, this was for others. For Huang Xiaolong, who could summon the Gate of Hell, he could come out anytime.

After entering the Gate of Nine Yin, Huang Xiaolong passed through a long and black space tunnel and arrived at a space filled with a myriad of colors.

Shi Ming, Shi Wushuang, Shi Yinyu, other Hall Masters, and Grand Elders who entered before Huang Xiaolong were nowhere in sight.

Whereas, behind Huang Xiaolong, the remaining Grand Elders and Elders entered. However, they did not stop. Everyone sped away, forming groups of two or three.

Behind the Gate of Nine Yin, other than the Corpse Soul Land, there were also numerous other treasures. If lucky, one could even find a mid-grade or high-grade grandmist spiritual vein.

When all the Grand Elders and Elders, who had entered after him, made groups and sped away, Huang Xiaolong decided on a direction and flew southward at a leisurely pace.

The moment Yang Jing had flown through the Gate of Nine Yin, Huang Xiaolong had placed a soul marking on her. Huang Xiaolong would be able to sense her. Anywhere inside this space, no matter where she went, based on this marking.

Wherever Yang Jing was, Shi Yinyu would be there as well.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to find Shi Yinyu. At the moment, Shi Yinyu was probably accompanied by Shi Ming and Shi Wushuang’s side.

Huang Xiaolong flew onward, aimlessly.

After a while, Huang Xiaolong found that this Nine Yin Space was quite big as he flew past one mountain range after another, one stretch of sea after another, large primordial forests, and numerous corpse soul beasts. These corpse soul beasts were the combination of corpse beasts and soul beasts. Not only did they have the annoying sturdy physical defenses and attack power of corpse beasts, but they also had the speed of a soul beast.

Huang Xiaolong did not conceal his presence. Hence the nearby corpse soul beasts detected him almost immediately and attacked.

However, Huang Xiaolong did not make any move. He merely used his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power to swallow all of them.

These corpse soul beasts were born in this Nine Yin Space. Other than the toxic corpse qi around their bodies, their entire body from blood to flesh and their souls were excellent supplements.

Of course, in the myriad worlds, only Huang Xiaolong was unafraid of the toxic corpse, thus he dared to swallow these corpse soul beasts directly.

“Spirit Dragon Blossom.”

“Wind Sea Divine Tree.”

“Golden Corpse Jade Core.”

As Huang Xiaolong flew over one mountain range after another, he spotted some treasures only heard of in legends. But Huang Xiaolong was not tempted to pick them. These were treasures to others, but for Huang Xiaolong, having them or not made no significant difference.

More than a dozen days later, Huang Xiaolong stood in the air, above a vast mainland.

This was the Corpse Soul Land!
