Chapter 3021: Nice Blade!

Holy herb?! Huang Xiaolong was stunned silly. He thought the Ice Soul Fruit was some sort of treasure!

When the white-haired old man saw the expressions on their faces, he was shocked, “Are you not here for the Ice Soul Fruit?”

Chuckling softly, Huang Xiaolong explained, “This is the first time I’m hearing of the Ice Soul Fruit…”

Staring at Huang Xiaolong with widened eyes, the white-haired old man was stunned. The Ice Soul Fruit was a holy herb, and its worth was immeasurable! How could the youngster before him be unaware of it? There was no way he would believe a lie like that!

With suspicious eyes, he stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Ignoring the white-haired old man, Huang Xiaolong continued to eat his Fiery Light Maize. He felt as though he had returned to Earth when he picked at the grains.

“What a pity… We don’t have meat to go with it.” Huang Xiaolong sighed after finishing a bowl.

Lei Yu roared with laughter all of a sudden. “I grabbed a whale beast earlier for Your Highness. You should really try it! The meat of the whale beast is really smooth and fragrant!” Waving his hand, a massive beast slammed into the ground.

The white-haired old man and the youngster stared at the massive beast before them. They didn’t expect a whale beast to drop from midair.

After all, the whale beast was a high-level spiritual beast in the Origin Holy World! It would only be served in banquets organized by the various creeds. The meat of the whale beast was extremely tender, and it was something ordinary people wouldn’t be able to buy with money! The white-haired old man also recalled that there were no whale beasts around the Bearded Dragon Scared Land.

He wondered how in the world had the two individuals sitting opposite him captured a whale beast?!

A look of suspicion flashed through the old man’s eyes as he stared at Lei Yu.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he stared at the whale beast suspiciously. “Is the whale beast really as delicious as you say? Do you think it will taste good if we cook it with the absolute blaze?”

A light lit up in Lei Yu’s eyes. “Your Highness, that’s a great idea! Why didn’t I think of it in the past?” As soon as he spoke, a fireball emerged from one of his heads and it flew towards the whale beast. In the next instant, a dense fragrance filled the courtyard.

Retrieving a short knife, Huang Xiaolong sliced off a piece of meat and carefully placed it in his mouth. The meat of the whale beast was delicious, and it melted on his tongue. Lei Yu was right. The meat was extremely tender and fragrant, and after they used the power of absolute flame to grill the meat, it contained an extraordinary amount of energy. As long as one took a bite, they would feel as though their body was floating on clouds.

“Nice!” Huang Xiaolong’s mind wandered back to the time when he was back in the Asura Gates in the lower world. When he had traveled out on journeys in the past, he would grill the meat of various beasts he slew along the way.

Gulps could be heard as the youngster sitting opposite him started swallowing mouthfuls of saliva. He stared at the piece of meat in Huang Xiaolong’s hand with glistening eyes and the old man was no different. A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he sliced off a large part of the whale beast for the two of them.

“Lei Yu, go grab some for yourself.” As soon as he spoke, Huang Xiaolong threw the blade in his hand towards the lightning beast.

Slicing off a huge chunk of meat, Lei Yu stared at the short blade in his hand and exclaimed in shock, “Nice blade!”

Of course it was. Huang Xiaolong had obtained it after he had defeated the Sword Venerable, and it was a top-grade cosmos artifact.

Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu seemed to be the only ones wasteful enough to grill the meat of a whale beast before slicing it up with a top-grade cosmos artifact…

After feasting for one entire day, the hill-sized whale beast was finally reduced to bones by the four of them. The meat of the whale beast was fatty, but it was something they couldn’t get enough of. After eating a slice, they quickly went back for another slice.

When the day finally ended, the white-haired old man’s impression of Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu changed. He became extremely respectful, and a trace of fear could be seen in his eyes when he looked at them. He might not know how profound the power of absolute blaze was, and neither was he aware of the blade in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. All he knew was that the flames could instantly roast the meat of a high-level True Saint Realm beast and the blade could slice it up effortlessly.

Throughout the meal, the old man spoke to Huang Xiaolong and mentioned the Bearded Dragon Sacred Land and the Ice Soul Fruit. They even talked about the village they were in and the Fiery Light Maize.

When the topic of the Ice Soul Fruit was brought up, the old man sighed, “Rumors are going around that an Ice Soul Fruit appeared in the vicinity. Many families from the Bearded Dragon Sacred Land sent out their experts to look for it. In the past month, experts of various families passed through this place.”

Huang Xiaolong finally understood why the old man thought that they were there for the Ice Soul Fruit.

“Little kid, answer a question of mine.” Lei Yu turned to the old man and spoke all of a sudden.

The white-haired old man looked old, but he was as young as a baby when compared to Lei Yu. After all, Lei Yu was a lightning beast born eons ago.

“Lord, please.” The old man bowed respectfully.

“I want to ask about the Lei Yu Creed. Tell me everything you know about it.”

“Leiyu Creed!” The white-haired old man felt as though his brain was struck by a lightning bolt. “As it turns out, you’re disciples of the Lei Yu Creed!”

Disciples?

Lei Yu didn’t bother explaining himself and he continued, “Yeah, whatever. Tell me everything you know.”

The look of reverence in the old man’s eyes grew deeper, and he started to tell them everything he knew.

Even though he wasn’t too knowledgeable, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu could tell that the Leiyu Creed was doing pretty well for itself.

Before the two of them could leave, a massive blast rang through the skies as the earth started to shake under their feet. A destructive energy started to spread towards the courtyard.

Shock overwhelmed the white-haired old man. It was clear that there were True Saint Realm experts exchanging blows.

As the shockwaves became stronger and stronger, they realized that the battle was slowly progressing towards them. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Several people charged towards the village all of a sudden, and Huang Xiaolong soon saw a group of people chasing one poor soul. It didn’t take long for the lone runner to arrive before them.

“Senior Brother Liu, save me!” The man stopped after arriving in front of them. He stared at the white-haired old man and pleaded for help.

With his expression changing, the old man exclaimed, “Junior Brother Lin?!”

It was clear the two of them knew each other, and by the time they spoke to each other, the large group caught up to them.

Surrounding the courtyard, someone in the group yelled, “Lin Tong, hand the Ice Soul Fruit over!”

The person who spoke was a young man who exuded an imposing aura.

Ice Soul Fruit!

The white-haired old man turned to stare at his junior brother.

A bitter smile formed on Lin Tong’s face as he nodded towards the old man. Turning to the young man who spoke earlier, he snapped, “If I hand it over, are you willing to let me leave?”

A sneer formed on the young man’s face as he swept his gaze across Huang Xiaolong and the others. “The news of the Ice Soul Fruit can never leave this place. All I can promise you is that I’ll allow you guys to die a quick death. I’ll exterminate this entire village after I obtain the Ice Soul Fruit.”

Huang Xiaolong stared at the young man with a placid expression.

As for the white-haired old man, he glared at the young man with an icy gaze and snorted, “Humph. You’re too arrogant!”

Two experts behind the young man released their auras all of a sudden, and the white-haired old man’s expression changed abruptly. “Ninth Heaven True Saints!”

“Old man, I’ll let you die in peace! I'm a disciple of the Scarlet Blood Clan!” The young man sniggered.

“Scarlet Blood Clan?!” The white-haired old man was shocked. The Scarlet Blood Clan was one of the strongest powers in the Leiyu Creed! Even if the youngster was a random disciple in the family, his status would be higher than all of them combined!

The white-haired old man couldn’t help but turn to Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu for help.
