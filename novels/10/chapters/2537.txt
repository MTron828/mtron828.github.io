Chapter 2538: Accepting the Inheritance

Not a single person expected it to be Tan Juan!

Even people like Tyrant Chu and Mo Cangli stared at her in disbelief. They weren’t the only ones as the Cangqiong Old Man raised a brow in shock.

Everyone was basically certain that Tan Juan was the first to enter the sixth floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor, and even if she wasn’t the first, she should be a close second.

However, she was transported out of the manor before three other people!

They screamed in shock when Tan Juan appeared.

“Master, I’m sorry.” Tan Juan quickly approached Xue Lingyun to apologize.

She knew that her master was extremely confident in her abilities, and she had failed to live up to her expectations. She hadn’t even seen the shadow of the key to the seventh floor before leaving the manor.

Snapping back to reality, Xue Lingyun forced herself to laugh, “It’s fine…”

However, was it really fine? The trace of bitterness in her laughter told everyone it wasn’t fine.

She was the Cangqiong Old Man’s daughter in name, and she could be counted as a nominal disciple of his. If Tan Juan accepted the old man’s inheritance, it would be the best-case scenario for three generations of master and disciple.

The greater the expectations were, the greater the disappointment was.

“Master, is Xie Bufan still in there?” Tan Juan asked. From what she knew, Xie Bufan was the only other person capable of holding the key. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“That’s right. However, Xie Bufan isn’t the only one inside. Li Chen and Huang Xiaolong are both still there.”

“What?! How can there be three of them? Is Huang Xiaolong still in the manor?!” A terrifying possibility flashed through her mind.

Was the mysterious third person Huang Xiaolong?!

“Yes.” Xue Lingyun nodded. “Huang Xiaolong isn’t out yet.”

Complicated feelings welled up in Xue Lingyun’s heart when she looked at her disciple. Even Tan Juan was transported out, but Huang Xiaolong managed to remain in the manor. It was an extremely embarrassing fact for her.

One had to know that Tan Juan was ranked number-one in the Trial of Blood!

“Senior Sister, are you alright?!” Ji Xinyi and Lin Xiaoying rushed over the moment Tan Juan returned.

“I’m fine.”

Even though she had managed to obtain several holy herbs and a treasure rarely seen in the Holy World, she couldn’t cheer herself up. After all, she failed to obtain the biggest treasure of them all! If she was being honest with herself, she was a little reluctant to resign to her fate.

However, everything was already set in stone now that she was out.

Not too long after she emerged, the light around the sixth floor disappeared.

Everyone stared at the sudden change in the situation with their jaws agape.

The light would only disappear after everyone from the floor was transported out! From what they could see, there wasn’t anyone left on the sixth floor of the manor!

However, there were three more people who hadn’t made it out!

How was this possible?!

“This can’t be… Li Chen, Xie Bufan, and Huang Xiaolong are still in the manor! Don’t tell me the three of them managed to enter the seventh floor…,” Jin Nu gasped in shock.

As soon as he spoke, everyone felt their heads spinning.

Three people entered the seventh floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor?!

Was something like this even possible?

Everyone stared at the Cangqiong Old Man and waited for a reply.

Xue Lingyun was the first to open her mouth to question her master, “Master, did the three of them really enter the seventh floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor?”

“Hehe, since they’re no longer on the sixth floor, where else can they be?” The Cangqiong Old Man chuckled softly.

“Didn’t you say that only a single person can obtain your inheritance?! You were the one who said that only one person could enter the seventh floor!” Xue Lingyun asked in confusion.

That was the point that puzzled everyone present.

A smile appeared on the Cangqiong Old Man’s face as he explained, “Only a single person can comprehend the grand dao law on the key to the seventh floor. However, I didn’t say that he couldn’t bring anyone else into the seventh floor…”

Everyone felt question marks popping up in their heads.

The Cangqiong Old Man might have tried to make it clear, but they still didn’t understand how three people had managed to enter the seventh floor.

Only after several seconds did they piece the puzzle together. It seemed as though the key was obtained by one of the three, and they brought the other two onto the seventh floor after a series of threats.

After all, no one would hand over the key to someone else.

So the ultimate question remained.

Who obtained the key?!

“I bet Xie Bufan managed to obtain the key! After all, he has an Undead Heart. He’s stronger than Li Chen when all is said and done.”

“It’s definitely Xie Bufan. Li Chen’s chance of obtaining the key is a little lower than Xie Bufan.”

All the patriarchs started guessing.

Practically everyone felt that Xie Bufan was the person who obtained the key. Not a single person mentioned Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Huang Xiaolong was a creator of miracles, he was only a Fifth Tribulation half-True Saint. His holy soul couldn’t compare to either Li Chen or Xie Bufan, and there was no way for him to be the one to obtain the key.

As for Cao Nan, he was extremely confident that Xie Bufan was the final winner and the smile on his face started to brighten up.

“Congratulations to you, Lord Cao Nan!” Several patriarchs came up to him and offered their congratulations.

Nodding his head, Cao Nan roared with laughter.

People like Duan Xuan and Shen Jiewen stared at Cao Nan with jealous expressions.

When Tyrant Chu looked at Cao Nan, who was laughing his *ss off, he couldn’t help but feel that the other party was doing it intentionally.

Day by day, time slowly passed.

Several patriarchs brought their disciples to bid farewell to the Cangqiong Old Man before taking their leave. Even Mo Cangli and the other experts from the Holy Lands Alliance took their leave.

The only ones who remained were those from the Clear Snow Palace, the Holy Heavens, and the Devil Palace.

Several years passed and on one fine day, a burst of light pierced into the skies as the grand dao descended on the lands.

“Someone is finally accepting the inheritance! Could it be Xie Bufan? How can he possibly comprehend the runes so quickly?” Ji Xinyi asked in shock.

Tan Juan was equally surprised.

Xue Lingyun, Tyrant Chu, and Cao Nan frowned in suspicion.

No matter who it was, it was impossible to comprehend the runes on the Cangqiong Old Man’s statue so quickly. Despite the confidence Cao Nan had in his disciple, he knew that Xie Bufan couldn’t accomplish a feat like that.

As for the Cangqiong Old Man, he sank into contemplation.

In the middle of the seventh floor, layers of runes emitted brilliant rays of holy light as the grand dao swirled about Huang Xiaolong. Traces of grand dao law emerged from the statue’s eyebrows, and they surged towards Huang Xiaolong.

After calming his mind, Huang Xiaolong started to circulate the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to devour the grand dao qi.

As time slowly passed, the aura Huang Xiaolong emitted was filled with traces of the grand dao.

His cultivation base didn’t remain stagnant either. From the early-Fifth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong quickly entered the mid-Fifth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

Years passed, and his cultivation base approached the Sixth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

The skies above the Cangqiong Hold Manor started to tremble as tribulation clouds gathered. Lightning dragons swarmed the skies as Huang Xiaolong’s sixth tribulation arrived.

Compared to the fifth tribulation, the sixth tribulation was several times stronger. The skies above the seventh floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor were filled with dark clouds almost instantly as the scope was four times larger than when he entered the Fifth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.
