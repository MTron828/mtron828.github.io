Chapter 2101: Location of the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele

When the little cow stared at the corpse, she raised her leg and smashed it into a paste. A cold harrumph left her lips, “How dare Wan Shi’s dog bark in front of me?!”

The three Skull Ancestors looked at the corpse before them, and they couldn’t believe their eyes. The other party had come with the All-Heavens Decree. After Huang Xiaolong killed him, Old Ancestor Azure Cow even had to trample on his corpse!

Huang Xiaolong retracted his gaze and looked at the three Skull Ancestors as he asked, “What about the thing I asked you to check up on?”

The three of them lowered their heads as they stammered, “Replying to Your Majesty, there isn’t any news about it yet... Please do not worry! We will definitely locate the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele soon!”

Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of disappointment fill his heart. He nodded before asking about the Saint Devil City and Devil World’s situation before dismissing them. Soon after, he summoned Zhao Yuan and questioned him about some things.

Half an hour passed, and Zhao Yuan finally left.

“Even though we can confirm that the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele is still in the Devil World, the Devil World is boundless! We won’t be able to locate it in a short amount of time!” Cang Mutian shook his head and said.

“Why don’t we head over to the Corpse Pool in the Rotting World?” The little cow thought for a moment before continuing, “Didn’t the Reverence Moon Old Man say that there is a level three origin treasure located in the corpse pool? If we manage to obtain it, the effects wouldn’t be worse than the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Cang Mutian shook his head again. “It’s impossible to obtain a level three origin treasure so easily. Dean Reverence Moon remained in the Corpse Pool in the Rotting World for several billion years, and he could only be certain that there was a level three origin treasure there. He failed to locate it. Moreover, the Corpse Pool is comparable to the Devil Holy Ground in size...”

A light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and he decided, “We’ll stay in the Devil World for a little bit more. If we still fail to locate the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele in two years, we will head over to the Rotting World!”

“That will have to do...” The little cow nodded in agreement.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the Flying Devil Python beside him, and his heart trembled. He asked about the Heavenless Archdevil Lord as there could be a clue hidden within the Archdevil Lord’s actions! After all, the Flying Devil Python was the Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s mount!

When Huang Xiaolong was listening to the experiences of the Flying Devil Python, Wan Yue was listening to the report in the main hall of his All-Heavens Divine Palace. When he heard about what had happened to the envoy and Huang Xiaolong, he crushed the cup in his hands as killing intent filled his eyes.

“Huang! Xiao! Long!” He gnashed his teeth and spat word by word.

How dare Huang Xiaolong kill someone from the City of All-Heavens! Lord Wan Shi was about to emerge from his secluded cultivation! Not to mention killing someone from the City of All-Heavens, Huang Xiaolong even tore the All-Heavens Decree to shreds!

Old Monster Lun Zhuan, the Old Crow Ancestor, King of Shadows, Shi Zhen, and the others were in the hall with Wan Yue, and they also heard the news.

“Huang Xiaolong is being really stubborn... He doesn’t know what’s good for him!” Lun Zhuan snorted, “Since he won’t repent even in the face of death, the day Lord Wan Shi emerges will be the day he dies!”

The Old Crow Ancestor chuckled, “This brat really doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. He even dares to destroy the All-Heavens Decree!”

The killing intent in Wan Yue’s heart rose the more he heard them speak.

He had even got people to spread the news about the All-Heavens Decree! Now that Huang Xiaolong had shredded his decree and killed his envoy, it was clear that Huang Xiaolong had delivered him a heavy slap to the face in front of the world!

“If I don’t kill Huang Xiaolong, I’m not a man!” A sinister light flashed through Wan Yue’s eyes.

“Pass down my order! Since Huang Xiaolong dares to disregard my order and refuses to repent, everyone related to him has to die! He killed someone from my City of All-Heavens, and for that, everyone related to him can be killed on sight!”

“Let’s see if everyone is the same as Huang Xiaolong! Let’s see if everyone dares to go against my City of All-Heavens!”

Wan Yue’s voice resounded through the room.

Soon, his order started to spread.

The myriad of worlds fell into chaos once again.

“Is Huang Xiaolong really not afraid of Lord Wan Shi?!”

“Lord Wan Shi is about the leave seclusion. Let’s wait for the good show to play out!”

...

After two days of staying in the headquarters of the Skull Devil Sect, Huang Xiaolong left and started to look for the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele.

Since he wasn’t able to pinpoint the approximate location of the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele, he could only fly around to try his luck.

Luckily for him, the radius he could sense after breaking through to the mid-level Sovereign Realm was much larger than before. Looking for the devil stele would be much easier.

Of course, he ordered everyone under him to look for traces of the devil stele to not waste time.

In the blink of an eye, a month passed.

Despite all his attempts, he failed to detect anything.

By then, Huang Xiaolong and the others had already arrived in the Cloud Sea Region in the Devil World.

The Cloud Sea Region was a special region in the Devil World. Beautiful clouds of different colors covered the space, and it was formed by both devil qi and spiritual qi. From afar, the region was covered in a mesmerizing glow. As everyone there seemed to be affected by the beauty of the clouds, the Cloud Sea Region was the region with the lowest amount of bloodshed.

Another month passed, and Huang Xiaolong finally reached the end of the Cloud Sea Region... No matter how he tried, he failed to locate the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele!

“D*mn it! I refuse to believe that we won’t be able to locate the devil stele even after searching through all thirty-six regions!” The little cow had long since been irate over their failure to locate the devil stele.

If they had all the time in the world, she wouldn’t be so annoyed. However, time was of the essence right now! The longer they took, the closer they got to Wan Shi’s emergence from secluded cultivation!

Huang Xiaolong shook his head as helplessness filled his eyes. He was really wasting time by looking for it aimlessly. It was too bad he couldn’t do anything to change it.

The only thing he was afraid of was that he wouldn’t be able to locate the devil stele after searching through all thirty-six regions in the Devil World. The Devil World wasn’t just made of the thirty-six regions. There were countless desolate grounds and death lands. All of them were vast and boundless. A single death land might even be bigger than one of the thirty-six regions itself!

Even if they had ten full years, they wouldn’t be able to search through the whole Devil World!

An hour passed as they flew about aimlessly. Suddenly, the other five Devil Steles in Huang Xiaolong’s body started to emit resplendent light.

This...

Concealed Scripture Devil Stele!

They finally located the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele!

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned to one of the cities located in the clouds. Based on the reaction he got from the five devil steles, the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele was located there!

“What’s wrong?” The little cow asked when she noticed the change in Huang Xiaolong’s mood.

Huang Xiaolong revealed a brilliant smile as he laughed, “The Concealed Scripture Devil Stele is in that city!”

“WHAT?!” The little cow and Cang Mutian didn’t dare to believe their ears. However, joy soon took over, and smiles blossomed on their faces. They had finally located the final devil stele!

“Haha! I knew that we wouldn’t be so unlucky!” The little cow roared with laughter, “Let’s go!” They turned into streaks of light as they charged towards the city located in the clouds.
