“Late-First Order Ancestor God Realm!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng exclaimed as he stared stupidly at Huang Xiaolong.

That’s right! This time, Huang Xiaolong had not only successfully broken through to Ancestor God Realm, but his cultivation had risen straight to late-First Order Ancestor God Realm!

Seven to eight years ago, Huang Xiaolong had just come out of the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space, when he was still a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm. During that time, Huang Xiaolong had consumed countless chaos spiritual pills. The chaos lightning qi had also supplemented his cultivation. Due to this, his godforce had long surpassed the average peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm masters back then. During this time, these past achievements had helped Hang Xiaolong to break through all the way to late-First Order Ancestor God Realm.

“Late-First Order Ancestor God Realm; my strength is still a bit too low.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head at the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s exclamation.

The little cow and void devil beast Xu Baisheng nearly choked on their own saliva. Even though he has broken through to late-First Order Ancestor God Realm, he is still complaining that it’s too low?!

“Kid, did you think you could have the same result as compared to when you broke through to Ancient God Realm? Did you expect to reach Second Order Ancestor God Realm?” The little cow couldn’t help rolling her eyes at Huang Xiaolong.

“This is the Ancestor God Realm! Not Ancient God Realm! In the past, when the Ancient Heavenly Emperor broke through to Ancestor God Realm, he had only reached the mid-First Order Ancestor God Realm!” The little cow added as if she couldn’t be any angrier at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was a little embarrassed listening to the little cow’s words. He defended by saying, “I was just saying that. There is no need to get so excited.” In truth, he understood that being able to advance to late-First Order Ancestor God Realm in one go was already hard to come by.

“Master, then your soul force...?!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng asked.

The little cow’s head jerked towards Huang Xiaolong, and she fixed her eyes on him as she waited for the answer.

Huang Xiaolong felt goosebumps running down his arms, but he nodded and answered, “Above 9,000!”

“Above 9,000!”

Both the little cow and void devil beast were ecstatic ‘As expected!’

As expected, Huang Xiaolong’s soul force had exceeded 9,000!

Even though they had already expected this, hearing it from Huang Xiaolong himself astounded them.

“... Compared to the King of Grandmist?” The little cow asked cautiously.

Huang Xiaolong answered honestly, “Higher than the King of Grandmist!

The little cow and void devil beast were quivering with excitement!

Yes, higher than the King of Grandmist!

The King of Grandmist had triggered six days and six nights of manifestations, whereas Huang Xiaolong had triggered nine days and nine nights of natural manifestations!

“Is it 9,500?” The little cow asked again.

Huang Xiaolong was a little speechless. Does this old cow need to guess so accurately? But he nodded and answered, “Yes!”

To be more precise, when Huang Xiaolong broke through to Ancestor God Realm, his soul force had reached 9,999! Just one small step, he would have reached 10,000!

Even so, 9,999 was already a number that could make other cultivators go crazy if they were to know about this. However, there was a small pang of regret in Huang Xiaolong’s heart for being unable to achieve the perfect score of 10,000.

Maybe, only the Son of Heavens Dao can reach 10,000? Huang Xiaolong thought to himself...

After they heard Huang Xiaolong’s affirmative answer that his soul force was higher than 9,500, both the little cow and void devil beast were too excited. It was as if their own soul force that had exceeded 9,500.

One could hardly blame the little cow for being so excited. Every one hundred increase in soul force above 7,000 represented the difference in future achievements. And for those with soul force above 9,000, every one hundred increase brought even bigger differences in achievements.

Huang Xiaolong’s soul force had actually exceeded 9,500. This meant Huang Xiaolong’s future achievements would surpass the King of Grandmist! As long as Huang Xiaolong did not die, he would become a hegemon of the Divine World one day! No, he would become the overlord of ten thousand worlds!

The little cow said excitedly, “This old cow already knew the Master this old cow follows is extraordinary!”

“Enough now. Let’s go out, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and the others have been waiting for a long time.” Huang Xiaolong said with a smile.

Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and void devil beast Xu Baisheng walked out of the palace together.

The black light casting a shadow over the Long Sun Mainland had already dispersed. Feng Er, Gui Yi, and the others immediately turned towards the entrance with surprise and joy when they heard the door open. They hurried over to meet Huang Xiaolong. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Manor Lord!” Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, Deng Qishun, Li Ye, and the rest saluted.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at them with a faint smile.

“Manor Lord, you’ve already broken through to Ancestor God Realm?!” Feng Er was shocked as she looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Gui Yi, Gui Er, Deng Qishun, Li Ye, and the others were shocked as well. Huang Xiaolong had not concealed his cultivation, therefore they could see that he had broken through to Ancestor God Realm. On top of that, it was the late-First Order Ancestor God Realm!

Late-First Order Ancestor God Realm!

They had never heard of someone’s cultivation realm reaching late-First Order Ancestor God Realm when breaking through to Ancestor God Realm!

Watching the shocked expressions around him, Huang Xiaolong grinned. “Yes, already broken through to Ancestor God Realm. Pass my down my order that all of the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples’ monthly allowance of divine pills and spirit stones will be doubled. Also, there will be a three-day celebration banquet!”

Huang Xiaolong was in a good mood after his cultivation had advanced to Ancestor God Realm.

“Yes, Manor Lord!” Deng Qishun and Li Ye complied respectfully.

“These are your rewards.” Huang Xiaolong took out two jade bottles. With a flick, the two jade bottles arrived in front of Deng Qishun and Li Ye.

When they opened these bottles, they saw alluring blue-colored water in them. They exclaimed in unison with ecstasy, “Blue Spectre Springwater!”

Previously, Huang Xiaolong had rewarded Zheng Guowen, Chen Zheng, and other Grand Elders with the Blue Spectre Springwater. This was also the reason why these two had known about the Blue Spectre Spring.

“Many thanks, Manor Lord!” The two Ancestors thanked Huang Xiaolong respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. He subsequently asked about the Sand Waves Sect’s affairs that had taken place during his seclusion.

Deng Qishun reported that a rumor about Song Qi and Liang Luwen’s death had been circulating in the Reverence World for a long time. The Reverence World’s Vast Cloud Sect and Clear Mind Sect were investigating this matter to verify the rumor’s credibility. It seems like they are preparing to attack the Sand Waves Sect. Huang Xiaolong calmly nodded, indicating that he had noted the matter.

On the same night, a grand celebration banquet took place at the Sand Waves Sect’s headquarters. It went on for three days, filled with a joyous atmosphere.

It was the fourth night since Huang Xiaolong had exited his seclusion. On this night, Huang Xiaolong was hovering high up in the air above the Sand Waves Sect. His three avatars were sitting cross-legged on the surface of his three supreme godheads, and each one was cultivating.

When the average geniuses’ avatars are condensed upon their break through to Ancestor God Realm, these avatars’ strength is somewhere between Xiantian Realm and Saint Realm. From there, the avatars cultivate and breakthrough to higher levels.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s three avatars were directly ‘born’ at peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm. Just a little bit more, and the three avatars could have stepped into the Ancient God Realm.

Although he didn’t know what kind of divine physique his three avatars had, he could feel that their physiques were not weaker than his True Dragon Physique.

Each of their godhead was also a supreme rank godhead, that was 499,999 li in diameter.

Each of the avatars’ supreme godhead was similar to the main body, but also different at the same time.

Huang Xiaolong decided to wait a few days for the three avatars to breakthrough to Ancient God Realm before heading back to the Vientiane World surface.

Just as Huang Xiaolong had made that decision, the Vast Cloud Sect’s Ancestor Li Qingwei and Sect Chief Yang Shi were perplexed when they heard their disciples report about the Sand Waves Sect three-day celebration banquet.

“Ancestor, can it be that one of the three Ancestors has broken through to God King Realm? Could it be the reason that the Sand Waves Sect was holding a three-day celebration banquet?” Vast Cloud Sect Chief Yang Shi made a guess.
