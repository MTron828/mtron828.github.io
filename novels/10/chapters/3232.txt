Chapter 3233: Meeting Huang Long

When he returned to the Blazing Dragon World and met his master, he was met with a torrent of abuses. The old dragon’s face sank as he went off.

After he was done, he sighed, “Where have you been?! Do you know that every single second counts?!”

“A billion years will pass in the blink of an eye!”

“You might be talented, but if you fail to break through to the grand perfection level of the God of Creation Realm, you won’t be able to save your father!”

The old dragon’s face was gloomy as he held back the urge to beat Huang Xiaolong up.

A helpless smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. From the looks of it, the old dragon probably thought that he went out to roam the universe.

“Master, I’ve been in seclusion this whole time…” Huang Xiaolong could only try to explain himself.

“Heh! How strong have you gotten since then? Have you reached three hundred million units of grand cosmos energy?” The old dragon stared at Huang Xiaolong and snorted angrily. “Alright, since you’ve been in seclusion all this time, I’ll let you off if you manage to show me three hundred million units of grand cosmos energy! Otherwise, you’ll have to stay here for the next one hundred million years until you enter the God of Creation Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong snickered when he heard his master’s estimation of his newfound strength. “Three hundred million units?”

“That’s right you little brat! It’s fine if you fail to reach four hundred million units of grand cosmos energy. I’ll let you off if you managed to accumulate three hundred million units!” He stared at Huang Xiaolong who was trying his best to force himself to remain expressionless and continued, “Don’t tell me you’re not even close to accumulating three hundred million units of grand cosmos energy?!”

A terrifying aura emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body all of a sudden. In an instant, the power of a cultivator who had one hundred million units of grand cosmos energy surged through the space around them.

Two hundred million!

Three hundred million!

The old dragon stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, but a look of joy soon formed on his face. It seemed as though the little brat wasn’t lying! He was really cultivating for the past twelve million years!

Just as he thought that Huang Xiaolong was about to stop there, another wave of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. The space around him started to crack and mountain ranges started to crumble. Even the rivers stopped flowing.

“Four hundred million!” The old dragon was so surprised he yelled in shock.

Of course, that wasn’t the end.

“Five hundred million?!” The old dragon was so shocked he jumped in fright.

His disciple actually managed to accumulate five hundred million units of grand cosmos energy after twelve million short years!

Even though he knew that Huang Xiaolong possessed unparalleled talent, he knew that gathering grand cosmos energy would get more and more difficult. He thought that four hundred million would be Huang Xiaolong’s limit, but it seemed as though his disciple’s limit was actually five hundred million!

That was five hundred million units of grand cosmos energy they were talking about! When he cultivated for ten million years in the past, he only managed to accumulate a little more than a million units. The difference between a million and five hundred million was… Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Huang Xiaolong stopped after revealing five hundred million units of grand cosmos energy.

He knew that if he showed off all the grand cosmos energy he managed to accumulate during his twelve million years of seclusion, the old dragon might just die from fright.

Whatever the case, five hundred million units of grand cosmos energy was shocking enough. If news were to spread, many people would be looking for a brick wall to smash their head in. It was especially so for the Extreme East Old Man, You Ming, and other people who had Huang Xiaolong as their enemy.

“Good, good, very good!” The old man was so happy he didn’t know what to do with his hands. Grabbing Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders all of a sudden, he roared with laughter, “Little brat, you’re too f*cking awesome!”

?!

Huang Xiaolong was stunned the old dragon would be able to use such a fashionable phrase, but he laughed nonetheless.

“Master, that’s…”

“I don’t care.”

Black lines formed on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead when he saw the old dragon’s reaction.

After indulging himself in his excitement for a short while, the old dragon turned serious. A smile remained on his face as he continued, “You didn’t disappoint you master! With your current speed, you will definitely be able to enter the God of Creation Realm in a hundred million years!”

A hundred million years? Huang Xiaolong shook his head inwardly. If his master knew his actual strength, he would probably change his evaluation. After all, the kid was right on the edge of entering the God of Creation Realm!

According to Huang Xiaolong, he would definitely be able to enter the God of Creation Realm in twenty million years!

“Master, can you use your secret art now?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

That was the reason he was so desperate to increase his strength in the first place.

The old dragon mentioned in the past that as long as Huang Xiaolong reached the grand perfection level, he would be able to meet his father with the help of the old dragon.

Now, his strength was more than enough to reach the old man’s standard.

“With your current strength, you can probably hide for an hour and a half. However, you failed to obtain the Soul Burying Orb. with it, you will be able to hide for longer!”

It was evident that Huang Xiaolong’s achievements in the World of Departed Souls hadn’t made its way around.

“Master, I actually obtained the orb a long time ago!” Admitting sheepishly, Huang Xiaolong retrieved a purple orb.

A look of surprise appeared on the old dragon’s face, and he roared with laughter, “You little brat, why didn’t you say so? Alright. Make your preparations. I’ll send you over with my secret art in a little bit.”

Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Xiaolong suppressed the anxiety in his heart. Nodding to the old dragon, he was ready.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong was good to go, the old dragon waved his arm and grand cosmos energy poured out from his body. It tore a hole in the void, and it stretched towards the edges of the heavens.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but exclaim eilently in his heart. He might have reached a whopping 2.59999 billion units of grand cosmos energy, but he felt like an ant before the old dragon. He could see that the grand cosmos energy that his master used remained in the void without any signs of dissipating, and even after being stretched thin, the strength contained within didn’t waver.

As the old dragon displayed his power, a spatial tunnel was formed. All Huang Xiaolong could see was weird fluctuations inside the runnel.

“Alright. Hurry and enter!” The old dragon said all of a sudden.

Without the slightest hesitation, Huang Xiaolong’s body flashed and he entered the spatial tunnel. He appeared on the other end in an instant.

Using the Soul Burying Orb, he hid his aura completely.

He found himself in a special space where runes spun around like webs, The runes covered the entire space they were in, and he saw a giant golden dragon that was trapped by the runes in the middle of the space, unable to move!

Huang Xiaolong could see that the body of the dragon was skewered by the runes, and it was clear that the runes were sucking away the golden dragon’s vitality and strength.

A sense of familiarity formed in Huang Xiaolong’s heart when he looked at the dragon. There was no need for any confirmation as Huang Xiaolong instantly recognized the golden dragon.

“Father!” With tears in his eyes, Huang Xiaolong rushed over with all his might.

Forcing his eyes open, the giant golden dragon looked at Huang Xiaolong. Traces of joy and excitement flashed in his eyes when he saw Huang Xiaolong. “My son, you’re finally here!”

My son, you’re finally here!

Tears streamed down Huang Xiaolong’s face when he heard the voice ringing in his head.
