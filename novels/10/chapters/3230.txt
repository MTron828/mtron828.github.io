Chapter 3231: Missing

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong looked at the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor who was on the brink of death.

The five celestial empires brought with them over ten thousand experts, but all of them were slain. The only person left was the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor who had eight hundred million units of grand cosmos energy.

With his body covered in blood, the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor’s appearance was no longer what it once was. With a distressed smile on his face, he sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, even the old dragon won’t be able to protect you now that you exterminated the experts of our celestial empires.

“Unless you remain in the World of Departed Souls your entire life, you will be hunted down to the ends of the universe!”

The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor knew what was about to come, and he had come to terms with fate.

“There’s no need for you to worry about me.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

He thought of the countermeasures a long time ago.

So what if he offended the five celestial empires?!

Moreover, there was no one who could prove that he was the one who killed them! As an expert who had eight hundred million units of grand cosmos energy, the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor was a powerhouse in the universe! Even if Huang Xiaolong personally admitted to killing them all, no one would believe him!

Several moments later, Huang Xiaolong destroyed the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor’s body and he threw every single one of their dao souls into the depths of the World of Departed Souls.

After dealing with all of them, Huang Xiaolong started to look through the loots of his battle.

Huang Shengdao had two creation artifacts with him, and Fu Luosen had a single creation artifact. The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor had one, and the Son of Creation of the Grand Myriad Celestial Empire also had one. There was the Soul Burying Silver Tree, and Huang Shengdao’s universe source spiritual vein. There were countless other treasures, and Huang Xiaolong managed to locate a ton of creation level spiritual pills on their bodies. There were both Extreme Bliss Spiritual Pills and Dao Emperor Spiritual Pills.

Even Sons of Creation at the level of Fu Luosen didn’t possess creation level pills. One could only imagine how precious they were. Only celestial emperor level figures would bring some along with them, and Huang Shengdao managed to obtain his from the Dao Emperor’s Treasury.

Since there were only several years left till the restrictions around the World of Departed Souls recovered, Huang Xiaolong decided to completely refine the world before they did.

The time passed in the blink of an eye, and the restrictions around the world started to shine.

The experts from the various factions departed immediately, and Huang Xiaolong followed closely behind.

He had completely refined the World of Departed Souls in the last few years, and he could enter whenever he pleased.

The old dragon questioned him the moment he left. “How was your trip to the World of Departed Souls?”

“It was great!” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Great was an understatement. Huang Xiaolong’s gains could be said to be overwhelming! He even managed to refine the entire world!

Not to mention the fact that the treasures on the bodies of Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor, Huang Shengdao, and the others fell into his hands the moment he killed them.

The old dragon laughed happily and he didn’t bother asking what Huang Xiaolong obtained. “That’s great then.” After he spoke, he brought Huang Xiaolong and they started their journey back to the Blazing Dragon World.

After the experts left the World of Departed Souls, they started to return to the worlds they came from.

There were extremely few people who paid attention to the disappearance of Fu Luosen, Huang Shengdao, and the others, but there were still several people who noticed.

“That’s weird. The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor and the experts of the Extreme Bliss Celestial Empire haven't emerged…” The Encompassing Essence Celestial Emperor frowned.

His relationship with the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor was pretty good, and he wanted to discuss something with the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor when they returned.

“The World of Departed Souls would close in half an hour. They should be out soon…” One of the marshals behind him muttered without thinking too much about it.

The Encompassing Essence Celestial Emperor nodded slowly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, by the time the restrictions around the World of Departed Souls recovered, the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor was nowhere to be seen! The world sank into the Soul Burying Silver River, and the expression of the Encompassing Essence Celestial Emperor finally changed.

“The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor didn’t emerge!” The experts of the Encompassing Essence Celestial Empire stared at each other in shock.

“They might have left a long time ago…” The Encompassing Essence Celestial Emperor sighed. Even though one wouldn’t leave the World of Departed Souls early, he didn’t wish for anything to happen to his good friend.

Several days later, the disappearance of the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor started to spread through the lands. The experts of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire, Great Myriad Celestial Empire, Buddha Yang Celestial Empire, and the True Dragon Celestial Empire were also missing! The experts sent by the five celestial empires were completely gone!

The news caused the entire universe to shake.

The disappearance of anyone among those would cause a stir in the universe, not to mention the fact that a celestial emperor was among them! There were also Huang Shengdao and Fu Luosen!

“The experts of the five celestial empires should be besieged by a group of Silver River Beasts…” Experts guessed.

“Impossible! The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor is an expert who has eight hundred million units of grand cosmos energy! Even if he ran into a group of Silver River Beasts, he will be able to remain alive!”

In the various great worlds in the universe, discussions flew about.

“Elder Lu, do you think it had something to do with the expert who laid down the space seal?” Zeng Ying asked all of a sudden.

“Sixth Princess, please speak with caution!” Elder Lu jumped in fright. That was a matter that concerned five celestial empires! If any of them heard it, a giant problem would land on their heads if the celestial empires held Zeng Ying accountable for her words.

However, Elder Lu shook his head eventually. “It doesn’t seem like it. The expert who laid down the space seal might be strong, but he wouldn’t be able to trap the experts of all five celestial empires! Only God of Creation Realm experts possess that level of power…”

Zeng Ying nodded her head.

On the way back to the Blazing Dragon World, Huang Xiaolong heard the rumors going around and like what he thought, his name didn’t even come up once.

As soon as they returned, Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion and he started to refine all the creation level pills he obtained.

Several tens of thousands of years passed in the blink of an eye, and Huang Xiaolong completed the refinement of the universe source spiritual veins along with the various pills.

He went to visit the old dragon, and he spoke of leaving the Blazing Dragon World for several years. The old dragon didn’t think too much about it, and he only told Huang Xiaolong to take care of himself. He handed over ten protection runes he refined himself.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stand on ceremony and kept them all.

“Master, about my family…”

“Relax. I’ll take care of them.” The old dragon reassured Huang Xiaolong.

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong felt at ease. With the old dragon watching over them, the Huang Family wouldn’t run into trouble. Huang Sheng might be the strongest expert in the universe, but he wouldn’t be the old dragon’s opponent in the Blazing Dragon World. The only way would be for Huang Sheng to surpass the God of Creation Realm.

Before he left, Huang Xiaolong went back to the Huang Family for a short visit.

After a few short years, Huang Xiaolong returned to the Soul Burying Silver River. He entered the World of Departed Souls once again, and this time, he planned on staying until he refined all the universe origin energy contained in the world origin! He knew that he wouldn’t emerge until he reached a billion units of grand cosmos energy!
