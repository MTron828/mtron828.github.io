Chapter 2244: What Kind of Godhead Would It Be

The Zhuoyuan Holy Grounds had a heritage passed down for several hundred billion years. While other continents had produced two, even three Holy Princes, the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent, and the neighboring Verdant Emerald Continent had only one Holy Prince each. This embarrassing record had made Du Gen, who was in charge of the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent, less than glorious in front of other continents’ branch masters.

But now, a Holy Prince has once again appeared in their Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent. This time, their Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent wouldn’t rank at the bottom like the Verdant Emerald Continent!

The more Du Gen thought about this happy event, the brighter the smile on his face was.

The experts behind him also smiled, seeing the brilliant smile on their branch master’s face. It had been a long time since they had seen the branch master smile so happily. Then again, a new Holy Prince appearing in their Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent was indeed a matter to be happy about.

“I heard this new Holy Prince is called Huang Xiaolong.” An old man with a head of white hair behind Du Gen mentioned.

This white-haired old man was the Head Enforcer of the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent’s Holy Gate branch. His name was Hu Gengyi. His status in the branch was only second to Du Gen.

“However, we’re unable to find out the exact information about his background and foundation.” Another Enforcer of the Holy Gate branch, Yang Chunmei, said with a shake of the head. “So far, we only managed to find out that when he first appeared, the Jinyuan Kingdom’s Princess Zhang Wenyue rescued him from the roadside. It is said that he had severe injuries on his body.”

Du Gen chuckled nonchalantly in response, “Since he could pass the Falling Jade Dynasty’s division test, it proves that there is nothing wrong with his origin. As for his background and foundation, there is no need to investigate further. Remember, he is our Holy Gate’s new Holy Prince. His background and foundation are not something we should investigate too deeply into!”

Yang Chunmei’s heart tightened, and he hurriedly complied, “Yes, Branch Master. This subordinate overstepped!”

She detected the hint of warning in Du Gen’s voice. As the Holy Gate’s Holy Prince, how noble was his identity? A branch enforcer like her had no right to delve too much into a Holy Prince’s background. Only the Holy Gate’s Eminent Elders had the authority to investigate a Holy Prince in detail.

“I wonder what kind of complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique the new Holy Prince has!” Hu Gengyi wondered aloud. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Although Huang Xiaolong had passed the Holy Gate division’s preliminary test, rising to the status of Holy Prince, the division’s large ancient array could merely detect that Huang Xiaolong possessed a complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique.”

Further details about Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique remained unknown.

Du Gen nodded his head, feeling the same. “However, according to the report of the testing scene, the new Holy Prince’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique are definitely not those low-ranking ones!”

In the Holy World, there were four thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine kinds of complete dao saint godheads. There were also the same number of saint bloodlines and saint physiques—four thousand, nine hundred, and ninety-nine kinds!

Hu Gengyi couldn’t help lamenting, “None of the Holy Princes from our Zhuoyuan Holy Grounds possess a complete dao saint godhead in the top ten ranking, and none have saint bloodline or saint physique within the top one hundred. This is not good for our Zhuoyuan Holy Grounds!”

Du Gen too sighed at the mention of this, and he agreed, “Yes ah, the Evolving Dragon Holy Grounds has been eyeing us, and treating our Zhuoyuan Holy Grounds like a thorn in their eyes.”

......

Back at the Lingering Fragrance Inn, Huang Xiaolong smiled looking at the hesitant Zhang Wenyue, and said, “Ask whatever you want to.”

A pinkish hue colored Zhang Wenyue’s delicate face as her fingers tugged the corner of her dress. She looked a little nervous as she asked, “Young Master, you really passed the Holy Gate’s test, becoming a new Holy Prince?”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “It’s probably true, they say I have a complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique. If the testing large ancient array did not malfunction, then I am the Holy Gate’s Holy Prince.”

Naturally, during the test, Huang Xiaolong had sealed off the Archdevil and Golden Buddha Complete Dao Saint Godheads, as well as two of his saint bloodlines, thus the large ancient array had merely detected one complete dao saint godhead, one saint bloodline, and one saint physique.

After hearing Huang Xiaolong’s answer as ‘it’s probably true,’ Zhang Wenyue became nervous. “Then, Young Master, do I have to call you Your Highness Holy Prince?”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were filled with mirth as he responded, “It’s up to you. You can still call me Young Master, or Your Highness Holy Prince.”

“Young Master, would you not want us by your side anymore after this?” Zhang Wenyue mustered up her courage and asked cautiously.

Huang Xiaolong found Zhang Wenyue’s expression funny, so he blinked playfully at her and said, “If your service is not good, then it’s hard to say.”

Upon realizing that Huang Xiaolong was teasing her, Zhang Wenyue’s face reddened and she quickly lowered her head.

At the side, far away, Zhang Haochen and Prince Qian stood straight, in a respectful manner, and they even looked a little fearful. The entire time, they didn’t dare to utter a sound.

Both of them felt the situation was too surreal and unbelievable.

The person they had once assumed to be a member of Black Demon Sect had turned out to be the Holy Gate’s new Holy Prince!

Some time passed when the Six-Eyed Ice Lion reported that the Lingering Fragrance Inn’s real owner had come to pay his respects.

Huang Xiaolong pondered for a second and allowed him to enter.

At the end of the day, Huang Xiaolong was staying at this person’s Inn. Even the big boss behind this Inn had shown up to pay his respects, so it wasn’t nice for Huang Xiaolong to put on an act.

Moments later, the Lingering Fragrance Inn’s real boss appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected him to be an old man with a carefully combed moustache and a goatee, with big eyes and a big nose.

The inn’s boss was extremely respectful towards Huang Xiaolong. He saluted Huang Xiaolong on his knees then offered the gifts he had prepared early on to Huang Xiaolong with both hands.

“Spiritual Camel Wood!” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help exclaiming in surprise upon opening the jade box the owner gave him as he found himself looking at a piece of glowing spiritual wood.

From Wan Zhuoyuan’s memories, Huang Xiaolong had learned that this Camel Spiritual Wood was one of the rare spiritual woods found in the Holy World. Needless to say, it was precious and expensive, and it was also one of the crucial ingredients in refining a level-five origin pill.

The Lingering Fragrance Inn’s boss’ eyes narrowed as he smiled, “Your Highness Holy Prince has a good eye.”

Huang Xiaolong went on to look at the treasures inside other jade boxes. All of them were Holy World’s rare treasures. One of the jade bottles contained a dozen level-four origin pills, which delighted Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was scheduled to set off to the Holy Gate’s headquarters, and his most urgent matter right now was raising his strength. This dozen of level-four origin pills was exactly what he needed the most at this point.

A while later, the Lingering Fragrance Inn’s boss tactfully took his leave instead of overstaying his welcome. Before leaving, he urged Huang Xiaolong to contact him if he needed anything and promised him that he could come running in the shortest time.

Not long after the Lingering Fragrance Inn’s boss left, the Falling Jade Dynasty’s Emperor Bi Liang, Big Dipper Sword Sect’s Chief Wang Tian, Incineration Valley Master Qin Zhixu, and other forces’ experts also came to pay respects.

Emperor Bi Liang and these people also offered the treasures they had carefully selected and prepared to Huang Xiaolong.

But when the Nine Heavens Gate’s Chief Du Youze came to pay his respects, Huang Xiaolong left him hanging outside for half a day. When Du Youze’s nerves were at the limit, he was allowed in.

The treasure Du Youze offered to Huang Xiaolong exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s expectation. It was something even more valuable than the Lingering Fragrance Inn boss’s or Emperor Bi Liang’s gift.

The stern expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face eased slightly.

Du Youze inwardly breathed in relief and spoke respectfully, “Rest assured, Your Highness Holy Prince. Both Zhou Heng and Zhao Ruigan, this pair of master-disciple, would be meted with severe punishments by the sect!”

After Du Youze left, other top-ranked forces’ Patriarchs, Old Ancestors, Sect Chiefs of Falling Jade Dynasties came to show their faces in front of Huang Xiaolong. Naturally, none of them manage to see Huang Xiaolong in person.

In the next several days, the emperors of dynasties around the Falling Jade Dynasty’s arrived consecutively, hoping for a chance to pay their respects to Huang Xiaolong.

Therefore, during these days, Huang Xiaolong received gifts until his hands were sore.

Sun Huage and Liu Cheng came to see Huang Xiaolong by the end of the week.

“Your Highness Holy Prince, the Branch Master will arrive in the late afternoon today.” Liu Cheng reported respectfully, and inquired, “In your opinion, should we...?”
