Chapter 2897: Make you Pay Ten Times as Much!

It was no wonder the members of the Mystical Pavilion would rage.

According to them, the status of their branch pavilion master was high above the masses. The four of them were sent to invite Huang Xiaolong, and that was an honor a Primal Ancestor should be more than thrilled to receive. How dare an ant-like Huang Xiaolong request for a strand of genesis energy!

Zhang Wen’s smiling face froze, and a trace of coldness flashed through his eyes. He didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would dare to ask for something so valuable!

However, the smile soon returned to his face. “Young Master Huang, the genesis energy isn’t as cheap as purple grandmist aura. A hidden expert once bought a strand from us, but he used ten billion grand dao coins in exchange.”

He might not have raged like the other two, but he was extremely displeased with Huang Xiaolong’s request.

Anyone would be able to hear the trace of mockery in his voice.

Glancing at Zhang Wen, Huang Xiaolong muttered coldly, “I was merely asking about the fact that someone managed to buy a strand of genesis energy. Did I mention I wanted a strand as compensation?”

The four of them stared at him in stunned silence when they heard what he said.

Raising the cup of tea in his hands, Huang Xiaolong causally took a sip, and he continued, “I might be easy-going at times, but I hate it when people question my ability. Who do you think you are? I changed my mind. Tell your branch pavilion master that he needs to bring out a strand of genesis energy if he wants my help.”

“What?!” The four of them thought that Huang Xiaolong was merely cracking a joke and that he would change his terms. They didn’t think that he would immediately request a strand of genesis energy in return.

The skinny elder glared at Huang Xiaolong and snapped, “Huang Xiaolong, who the f*ck do you think you are? With our branch pavilion master’s identity, even the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable will have to lower himself to refine a pill with him if he wills it! Moreover, the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable wouldn't dare to ask for any remuneration!”

“You’re just a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor. Who do you think you are? Do you really think that you’re invincible because of your talent? If you dare to offend our Mystical Pavilion, we’ll crush you any time we wish!”

Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred as he appeared in front of Chen Shaoen. “Crush me?”

Chen Shaoen failed to react in time before Huang Xiaolong sent him flying off with a single kick.

With Huang Xiaolong’s foot slamming straight into his belly, Chen Shaoen was sent flying like Xuanyuan Potian.

Of course, he didn’t forget to use his nirvana energy in the kick.

With a miserable howl, the skinny elder was sent flying out of the Dragon Emperor Manor.

“What?!”

Zhang Wen and the others were shocked. They didn’t expect that Huang Xiaolong would dare to move against them.

As high-level enforcers of the Mystical Pavilion, even the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable wouldn’t dare to make a move on them!

“You!” Shi Chuan, the white-browed expert, roared in rage as he locked his aura on Huang Xiaolong.

Before he could do anything, Zhang Wen stretched out his hand to stop them from going any further.

Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, Zhang Wen snapped, “Young Master Huang, do you know the outcome of offending us?”

“It seems like Xuanyuan Potian said the same thing to me several days ago.”

Zhang Wen’s throat spasmed as he thought about the reports he had heard.

Indeed, their statuses were exalted, but they were slightly lacking when it came to challenging Xuanyuan Potian’s status. They might be Fourth Esteem Dao Venerables, but they were mere enforcers of the Mystical Pavilion. Xuanyuan Potian was the young patriarch of the Xuanyuan Creed, and he was one of the two tigers of the Divine Tuo Holy World!

Zhang Wen glared at Huang Xiaolong for a whole minute before speaking. “Our branch pavilion master sent me over to express his sincerity. I hope Young Master Huang will change his condition.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. He didn’t expect that the other party would still request for him to refine a pill after sending one of them flying.

It seemed as though the pill was extremely important to the Mystical Pavilion Branch Master!

Of course, it made sense after he thought about it. How trashy could a pill be if it required the power of absolute frost, flame, and his nirvana flame?

“Alright. I can change my condition.” Huang Xiaolong snickered. “I want thirty strands of beginning qi.”

He knew that it was impossible for the other party to bring out a strand of genesis energy, and he changed it t beginning qi. It might not be comparable to the genesis energy, but it was several times more valuable than purple grandmist aura! If he managed to obtain thirty strands, he would definitely be able to enter the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm!

The most important thing to Huang Xiaolong was entering the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

Beginning qi might be precious, but Huang XIaolong believed that the branch pavilion master of the Mystical Pavilion would definitely be able to obtain them!

“...” The faces of Zhang Wen and the others sank.

It was true that the beginning qi wasn’t as rare as genesis energy, but it was still something extremely valuable! Even Fourth Esteem Dao Venerables like them wouldn’t be able to afford one easily, much less thirty of them!

Zhang Wen frowned. “Young Master Huang, thirty strands of beginning qi is too much… Why don’t we give you three strands of it if the refinement is successful?”

Three? Huang Xiaolong sneered in his heart. He wondered if he was the one requesting for them to help him refine a pill or if they were the ones asking for a favor.

“Go back and tell your branch pavilion master that my price is thirty strands of beginning qi. I want twenty strands before the refinement process. As for the other ten, you can give them to me after we successfully refine the pill.”

“What?! Twenty strands upfront?!” Shi Chuan raged. “Huang Xiaolong do you think you’re…”

“Enough!” Zhang Wen glared at the white-browed expert before turning to Huang Xiaolong, “I will relay your request to our branch pavilion master after I return.”

Huang Xiaolong stared at him with an expressionless face and muttered, “If your branch pavilion master doesn’t give me a reply in ten days, I’ll void the deal.”

With his expression turning dark, Zhang Wen didn’t say a word.

No longer staying around, the four of them brought Chen Shaoen away from the manor.

“Your Highness, wouldn’t the Mystical Pavilion…” Long Jianfei and the others couldn’t help but worry when Zhang Wen and the others left.

Huang Xiaolong merely waved his hand and sighed, “It’s fine.”

As long as they needed his help, they wouldn’t dare to move rashly.

Moreover, his strength wasn’t something they could look down on.

By the time Zhang Wen and the others left Monarch Yu Sacred Land, the rage in their hearts overwhelmed them.

“Brother Zhang Wen, he’s f*cking crazy! Who the hell does he think he is? How dare he ask for thirty strands of beginning qi?” Chen Shaoen growled, “Are we really going to agree?”

Killing intent had formed in his heart after Huang Xiaolong had sent him flying away.

Glancing at Chen Shaoen, a frosty light flashed through Zhang Wen’s eyes. “It doesn’t matter. After the refinement, I’ll make him spit out ten times as much!”
