The temperature in Feng Yang’s gaze dropped a few degrees lower. With a flip of his palm, the Jiang, Wang, and Gudu Families’ Elders were sent flying into the air, then slammed down heavily. Sprawled on the floor, the three Elders’ bodies twitched without control while white foam frotted out from their mouths. Their eyes rolled back as if they were suffering an episode of epilepsy.

Although the three Elders weren’t weak, being Seventh Order God Realm masters, in front of the Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang, hailed as the strongest person in the Black Tortoise Galaxy, the three families’ Elders were no different than newborn babies, incapable of putting up even an ounce of resistance!

All of a sudden, a piercing foul stench assaulted Huang Xiaolong’s senses. Tracing the source, he saw that the three female disciples manning the counter were shaking, fear paralyzing their delicate faces, and a dark wet patch on the lower part of their dresses.

In a residence not far from the gambling house, a few streets away, Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Gudu Ye were still sipping spiritual tea in a leisurely manner.

Jiang Wuhuang smacked his lips after taking a mouthful, contentment obvious on his face, “This Immortal Tea produced by the Heavenly Mountain is really soothing.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Gudu Ye smiled in agreement, “It’s a pity that the quantity is just too little, just enough for us old men.”

Wang Dingyi was also savoring the fragrant spiritual tea, a smile emerged on his face, “Then again, only us few old men can afford to drink it. If anyone could drink this tea, then it wouldn’t taste as good.”

Jiang Wuhuang chuckled, “Brother Wang is wise!”

While the three were enjoying their tea, a Jiang Family Elder ran in flustered, his face ashen with fear, “ Patriarch, it’s bad, that kid hired a master and came over to collect his winnings!”

Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Gudu Ye were fully enjoying their spiritual tea, being interrupted severely soured their mood, “Which kid?” Jiang Wuhuang failed to connect the matter for a second.

“It’s that twenty billion kid!” Not daring to conceal the matter, the Jiang Family Elder blurted in a strained voice.

Twenty billion!

The three old men were instantly jolted to their senses.

“Hired a master?” Jiang Wuhuang’s eyes narrowed to cold thin slits, “How many people does the other side have?”

“O-only, two.” The Jiang Family Elder hesitated.

“Only two people?” Jiang Wuhuang and the other two people’s tensed faces relaxed immediately, while Jiang Wuhuang himself burst out laughing, “I thought the kid brought over a large army of ten thousand equipped with horses and spears. Good, I’ve been feeling a little bored here, let’s go over and see if the two experts that the kid brought have three heads and six arms.” He then looked at Wang Dingyi and Gudu Ye, inquiring, “What about these two Patriarchs?”

Wang Dingyi chuckled softly, “I shall join you to relieve my boredom a little.”

Gudu Ye chimed in, “I hope those two people won’t piss their pants after seeing the three of us making this trip personally.”

All three men’s laugh echoed in the air as they each stood up, heading toward the gambling house.

Following behind the three Patriarchs were masters from each family, moving at a leisurely pace as they chatted and laughed the entire way to the gambling house.

Even so, it didn’t take them long to arrive at the gambling house. Seeing that many of their three families’ guards and disciples laid injured all around the gambling house entrance, a sharp gleam flickered across the three Patriarchs’ eyes.

Just when Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Gudu Ye stormed inside the gambling house with a face full of wrath, they were momentarily stumped. At this point, both Huang Xiaolong and Feng Yang had their backs toward the main entrance, thus the three Patriarchs only saw their backs, yet it was enough to give them a sense of familiarity. Even so, they failed to grasp why it was so.

In the next moment, the Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang and Huang Xiaolong turned around.

When Feng Yang’s face was clearly facing them, Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Gudu Ye shuddered inwardly, crying out in unison before they could stop themselves: “Black Warrior Institute Principal!”

Hearing the loud exclamation of their own family Patriarchs, the three families’ masters who were trailing from behind with fierce momentum into the gambling house felt their legs grow weak at the knees, their bodies leaning backward.

The Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang’s cold gaze swept over the three Patriarchs, a cold satirical tone could be detected in his voice, “The three Patriarchs have such lofty airs.”

Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Gudu Ye’s expressions were as ugly as they could be.

“Feng Yang, don’t think we’re afraid of you.” Jiang Wuhuang was quick to compose himself, speaking with extreme sullenness, “Both of you, Master and disciple came over to raise trouble at our gambling house, injuring our three families’ guards, disciples, and even Elders. I will file a complaint to the Cloudsea Mainland’s Enforcers, demanding an explanation!”

Feng Yang laughed aloud, “Truly, the characters of the disciples and slaves reflect on the kind of Patriarch they have! Us Master and disciple came to cause trouble? I say, Little Jiang punk, what do you eat that makes your farts stink so badly? Enough, I’m not that idle to spend the whole day here listening to you farting away. A few days earlier, my disciple placed a bet of twenty billion at your place here, and today, I have come to collect the money!”

Little Jiang punk?! Farting?!

Jiang Wuhuang’s face turned red and purple at those words.

Amidst their anger, Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Gudu Ye still had spare time to look in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

“Several days ago, I was in disguise.” Huang Xiaolong nonchalantly admitted.

Just when Jiang Wuhuang wanted to speak again, Feng Yang brusquely interjected, “You lot shouldn’t even think of weaseling out of it. In the Black Tortoise Galaxy, there has yet to be anyone who dared to do so in front of me! I’ll give you three one hour, if I do not see three hundred and forty billion in front of me in one hour’s time, don’t blame me if I dismantle all your three families’ shops, residences, and gambling houses in the Cloudsea Mainland!”

All three Patriarchs were hollering with boundless wrath in their hearts. This was a blatant threat flung right at their faces! However, based on their understanding of the Black Warrior Institute Principal, he never went back on his words. Not to mention, as the strongest person in the Black Tortoise Galaxy, Feng Yang had this power and strength!

Even if the Ancestors of their three families combined their efforts, they still wouldn’t have a hundred percent confidence to defeat the strongest person of the Black Tortoise Galaxy, Feng Yang.

In the end, the three Patriarchs could only repress and swallow their raging fury, striving to have three hundred and forty billion placed in front of Feng Yang and Huang Xiaolong within one hour’s time.

Looking at the neatly organized three hundred and forty billion Xuanwu coins in front of him, Feng Yang flashed a radiant smile, “Next time, if there’s such a good deal, remember to tell me, I can place a few billion bets and win some small change to spend.”

Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Gudu Ye’s faces twitched, blood almost flowing in reverse inside their heart capillaries, making them feel like they were about to vomit blood.

Feng Yang patted his youngest disciple’s shoulder, laughing as he said, “Three hundred and forty billion seems a bit little, you should have bet forty billion that time!”

Forty billion, that would bring Huang Xiaolong’s winnings to six hundred and eighty billion! Listening at the side, the three Patriarchs’ eyes turned scarlet, battling the strong impulse of committing murder on the spot.

Feng Yang ignored the three people’s murderous gazes, still laughing vibrantly as he stood up and walked toward the exit with Huang Xiaolong.

While Feng Yang was crossing the door’s threshold, he suddenly stopped and turned halfway around, looking at the three Patriarchs, “This gambling house of yours violated the Black Warrior City’s rules, injuring innocents. I’ll order the Black Warrior City disciples to come to seal the building! I’m giving face to your old men (Ancestors) so I won’t detain you lot!”

Seal the building!

The volcano of fury that Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Gudu Ye had barely suppressed completely erupted.

Even so, they could only watch the Master and disciple, Feng Yang and Huang Xiaolong, leave with fire spitting from their eyes

“Feng Yang, that old monster, is too much!” After the two people’s figures disappeared from view, Jiang Wuhuang roared at the top of his lungs, akin to a wounded fierce beast.

‘Wait till the next God Ranking List Battle, we’ll pay you back with interest!’ The killing intent in Wang Dingyi’s eyes exploded.

Whereas the Master and disciple duo did not immediately return to the Black Warrior Institute after that. Instead, they chose a big restaurant in the Black Warrior City, preparing to have several jugs of good wine.

It was half a day later when the two of them headed back to the Black Warrior Institute.

Returning to the Golden Dragon Peak, Huang Xiaolong spent the rest of the day with his family before entering closed-door practice in order to advance to mid-Fifth Order God Realm.
