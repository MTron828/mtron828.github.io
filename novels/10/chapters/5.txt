Chapter 06: It Is Useless to Beg Me!

As he sat in the hall, although Huang Ming found Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong’s visit a little sudden, he remained seated and did not rise when Huang Peng entered the hall.

"Second Manor Lord." Zhou Guang and his son, Zhou Xuedong, seeing it was Huang Peng, immediately stood up and greeted Huang Peng, not daring to remain seated like Huang Ming.

Huang Peng first nodded at the Zhou father and son pair and then he turned to Huang Ming: "Big brother.”

Huang Xiaolong followed with a somewhat reluctant voice: "Eldest uncle."

Huang Ming’s face was expressionless as usual and said: "Second Brother, you’re here. Sit."

Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong sat down on the chairs to the side. As Huang Peng was sitting down, he was contemplating how he should word his request to Huang Ming. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

"Second Brother, what brings you over here?" At this moment, Huang Ming asked.

Huang Peng hesitated for a moment before honestly saying: "Big brother, I heard Huang Wei had said that at the end-of-the-year annual Clan Assembly, he will cripple both of Xiaolong’s arms, so...” Huang Peng’s words trailed off here.

"Oh, is there such a matter?" Huang Ming looked astonished.

Huang Xiaolong looking at his Uncle Huang Ming’s deadpan expression and snickered inwardly. Even his father, Huang Peng, has heard about the matter, which means the news had already spread to the entire Huang Clan Manorㅡthere is no way that Huang Ming did not know about it.

"Huang Wei, is there such a matter?" Huang Ming turned over and asked his son, Huang Wei.

Huang Wei answered with unblinking eyes and an unchanging facial expression: “There is no such thing.” Glancing at Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong, Huang Wei continued: “In my opinion, there are people who are deliberately using this as an excuse to cause trouble for our Northern Courtyard.”

Huang Peng’s face turned beet red from anger when he heard this. Did this mean that he and his son were idle people with nothing better to do so instead would run over to cause trouble for Huang Ming and his son?

Huang Xiaolong was watching Huang Ming and Huang Wei. This pair of father and son’s ‘performance’ where one person asks innocently and the other answers in kind was ridiculous. He sneered in his heart.

"Big brother, what do you say about this matter?!" Holding back his anger, Huang Peng turned to Huang Ming.

Huang Ming waved, still maintaining his deadpan expression: "Well, Second brother since there is no such thing, you can go back now."

No such thing! The meaning behind Huang Ming’s words was extremely clearㅡthat Huang Peng came over to look for trouble.

Repressing his rising anger, Huang Peng said: "Big brother, you mean to say that us, father and son, have nothing better to do, so we came over here to make trouble for you?!”

Huang Ming frowned as his face turned cold: "Even if the matter is true, what about it? Sparring between same age peers during the Clan Assembly is a common event.”

Huang Ming said this frivolously but he did not mention anything about Huang Wei wanting to cripple both of Huang Xiaolong’s arms.

Huang Peng stood up in a rage, staring at his Big Brother Huang Ming: "Are you saying even if Huang Wei wasted both of Xiaolong’s arms, this is normal?!"

With indifference on his face, Huang Ming said, "Then, are you implying that I should ban the peer sparring event during the annual Clan Assembly? The peer sparring event is a rule set by Father. Do you mean to say the rules set by Father are wrong?”

A harsh light glinted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. His father’s intention was just to have Huang Ming advise his son to let Huang Xiaolong off. Everyone in the hall knew what his father’s intention was. But Huang Ming twisted the facts, claiming that Huang Peng was requesting him, Huang Ming, to ban an event set by their Father to make things difficult for him.

Zhou Guang and Zhou Xuedong, both father and son, sat there without speaking. In their eyes, their gloating pleasure was obvious.

Huang Peng’s face flushed red with anger. Clenching both of his fists and taking a deep breath, he said to Huang Ming: "Xiaolong is your nephew!”

Huang Ming raised his eyebrow, glanced at Huang Xiaolong and said to Huang Peng, "Do I need you to remind me about this? Don’t I know he is my nephew? Even if he is my nephew, it is useless for you to beg me!"

Huang Peng laughed despite his anger. "Good, good." Now, he finally sees his big brother’s true face and a chilling feeling filled his heartㅡdecades of brotherhood, yet they are no better than strangers!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t resist saying in a cold voice: "Huang Ming, do you truly think that your son is capable of crippling me during the Clan Assembly?

“Impudent!” Seeing a little brat like Huang Xiaolong daring to refer to him by name in front of Zhou Guang, he furiously stood up and he raised his palm to strike at Huang Xiaolong. An overbearing battle qi was aimed towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest. Suddenly, a silhouette flashed and blocked the battle qi for Huang Xiaolong.

"Boom!" An explosion resounded and the silhouette blocking the attack in front of Huang Xiaolong staggered back heavily with a “deng deng” sound.

"Dad, are you okay?!" Huang Xiaolong was anxious as he sped to his father’s side.

Huang Peng waved his hand, shaking his head: "I’m fine.”

In the end, Huang Xiaolong was still Huang Ming’s nephew. Although he was angered, Huang Ming struck with control. Otherwise, with Huang Peng’s late-Sixth Order strength, it would be insufficient to block a palm from Huang Ming, a late-Seventh Order warrior.

Huang Xiaolong seeing that his father was not injured breathed a sigh of relief.

At this time, Huang Wei who was quietly standing on the side came up and said: "Second uncle if you want me to let Huang Xiaolong off, it is not impossible as long as Huang Xiaolong kneels down, kowtows three times loudly, and lets me slap him twenty times at the end of the year Clan Assembly. Then I will let him off!”

Kowtow three times and twenty slaps? Huang Peng’s brows creased tightly and he looked at his son.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Wei and said with a cold voice, "In the past or now, I, Huang Xiaolong, kneel before Heaven and kneel before Earth, but never before a person!” Then, turning to Huang Peng he said, "Father, let’s go!”

Kneeling before Heaven, kneeling before Earth, but never before a person! Huang Peng was startled but he smiled appreciatively: "Good, son! Let’s go!" Saying that, Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong turned to leave.

Huang Wei looked at Huang Peng and Huang Xiaolong’s departing silhouettes and with anger rising in his heart he started yelling at Huang Xiaolong’s back: "Huang Xiaolong, do you think I wouldn’t dare to cripple your arms during the Clan Assembly?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even turn around as he left the Northern Courtyard entrance with his father. Huang Ming looked at the two disappearing figures, his face complicated.

“Eldest Manor Lord, just because of Huang Xiaolong’s identity was he disrespectful to family elders, even daring to refer to Eldest Manor Lord by name. This is too-" At this time, Zhou Guang walked up to Huang Ming and was speaking.

However, the words had yet to finish before Huang Ming’s palm swept past Zhou Guang’s face, leaving behind a clear red five-finger mark on his face.

Huang Ming looked at Zhou Guang, his face expressionless but his eyes were as sharp as knives: "This is something between us brothers, you are not qualified to butt in!"

"Yes, yes, Eldest Manor Lord, it is subordinate’s mistake, subordinate’s mistake!" Zhou Guang panicked and apologized over and over again.

After a while, Huang Xiaolong and his father, Huang Peng, returned to the Eastern Courtyard. Su Yan, knowing that Huang Xiaolong and Huang Peng had returned, quickly walked up to them and asked in a worried voice: “How was it?”

Huang Peng did not know how to explain. Instead, it was Huang Xiaolong who said: "Mom, you don’t have to worry about the Clan Assembly, I will be fine. Nothing will happen to me.”

After hearing this, Su Yan thought Huang Wei had promised to let Huang Xiaolong off during the Clan Assembly‘s sparring event and her worried heart was finally appeased. Smiling, she said, "That’s wonderful, then all is good!"

Huang Peng opened his mouth wanting to say something, but looking at his wife’s happy smile, he said nothing in the end.
