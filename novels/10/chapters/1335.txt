“Go!” Huang Xiaolong urged the little cow and she was the first to leap into the air, and fly towards the black hole on the eastside of the cave wall. Void devil beast Xu Baisheng quickly followed behind them. He was followed by the group of Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders, while Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er entered last.

The cave tunnel was less than spacious, and none of them could even see their own fingers within the cave’s darkness. However, the ghostly wind and the Soulless Frigid Wind was considerably weak inside this part of the cave. On top of that, Huang Xiaolong’s group also encountered less number of ghostly creatures. This greatly eased their journey.

Huang Xiaolong had retrieved the Yellow Springs Magic Robe. It hung on his shoulders like a cloak, the glimmering magic symbols and the diagram of a great devil holding an axe on its surface had dimmed, but everyone could still feel its majestic aura, making their hearts palpitate.

The Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders had been staring feverishly at Huang Xiaolong’s Yellow Springs Magic Robe for a long time now. Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder at the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elder Zheng Guowen, "Zheng Guowen, what do you think about my magic robe?’

Zheng Guowen was caught off guard by Huang Xiaolong’s abrupt question and ’ah!’. Noticing that Huang Xiaolong was looking at him with unfathomable meaning, he hastened to reply, “Very good, very powerful. I have never seen such a powerful magic robe.”

Huang Xiaolong went on nonchalantly, "In truth, this magic robe has suffered severe damages, and its power has fallen by ninety percent, otherwise, it would be even more powerful!"

What!

Severe damages, at ninety percent less power!

The hearts of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders quivered. In other words, what they had seen so far was only one-tenth of the magic robe’s power? If that was the case, if the magic robe were returned to its peak power, then...!

For a moment, they did not even dare to think further. But soon, their desire and obsession towards the robe intensified.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, as their expressions had not escaped his eyes. He was certain that if it wasn’t for the void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the others, these people would have pounced on him to snatch his robe.

"As long as all of you are loyal to me, I won’t ill-treat any of you." Huang Xiaolong added suddenly.

Zheng Guowen quickly complied, "Please rest assured, Manor Lord. All of us are undoubtedly loyal to Manor Lord, we pledge to follow Manor Lord forever."

After the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders had ’submitted’ to Huang Xiaolong, he had ordered them to address him as their Manor Lord, just like Feng Er and others did.

Other Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders also joined in, each righteously announced their loyalty to Huang Xiaolong.

The conversation ended and silence returned in the black tunnel.

...

The group continued flying deeper into the black tunnel.

Almost two hours later, the black tunnel path gradually widened and grew brighter. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong and the others smelled faint scents of spiritual herbs which made them quickened their speed.

"Based on our current speed, we will reach there in half a day’s time." The little cow informed Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Another two hours passed when the path in front of them turned bright.

Everyone dazed for a second when they saw the scenery in front of them as they flew out from the tunnel to an open space. They had reached the other end of the tunnel.

In front of them was an endless range of mountains, and all they could see were tall mountains. The lush green vegetation on these mountains consisted of various spiritual herbal ingredients along with different kinds of towering old trees. The air was filled with the scent from these herbs.

On top of that, the cold, ghostly wind and death qi didn’t exist here; even if there were any remnants of ghostly wind or death qi,herbal scents in the air negated them.

Huang Xiaolong’s group flew towards the mountains.

When they were flying over one of the many mountains, one of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders exclaimed, “That-that, is that the Water Magic Fruit?!”

Everyone looked at the mountain below them. Several giant trees were clustered over mountain peak. On these giant trees hung crystalline green-colored fruits, and inside these fruits were wisps of agile black qi.

The Water Magic Fruit was originally one of Hell’s rare spiritual fruits, and no one had thought it would appear here!

Sometimes,Water Magic Fruits were auctioned at sky high prices by the auction houses in the divine world; a price that the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders couldn’t afford.

In a split second, all the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders rushed down towards the mountain peak below. They kept fighting amongst themselves to pick the Water Magic Fruit.

Fury glimmered in the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s eyes, as he watched the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders rush to snatch the Water Magic Fruit without asking permission from Huang Xiaolong. His palm reached out and pressed down in the air.

Below, all the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders were sent flying in various directions, and their bodies smashed into the mountain below.

All of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders were enraged as Xu Baisheng had attacked them out of nowhere. But they shuddered in fear as they saw void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s frosty gaze, and were jolted to their senses.

“What, want to fight?” Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent cold voice sounded.

“No, we would not dare to do that.” The group of Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders denied hurriedly.

“Kill him!” Huang Xiaolong said as he pointed at one of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders, since he was the one who had led the others to snatch the Water Magic Fruit. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s palm struck out with a turn of his paw, and an overwhelming force smashed onto the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elder’s chest. Even before he realized, the Grand Elder exploded into blood mist.

“Zhuang Ping!”

The Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong, “You—!”

“Want to kill me?” Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over several furious Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders, while a cold sneer rose at the corner of his lips, “I have known the entire time that all of you have wanted to kill me at an opportune time, to avenge your Sect Chief. Earlier, all of you were praying inwardly for the Blue Spirit Gate’s group to kill me, am I right?”

Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elder Zheng Guowen forced a smile on his face, and said, “Manor Lord must be joking, all of us have sincerely pledged loyalty to Manor Lord, there are no ulterior motives.”

"You better not." Huang Xiaolong stated. Then he turned to other Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders who looked like they wanted to kill him, and said, “Since you want to kill me, I will give you a chance—only one chance!”

“Three!” Huang Xiaolong begun to count.

These Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders’ faces tightened.

They had been extremely confident that Huang Xiaolong was interested in conquering the Sand Waves Sect through them, therefore, they had been extremely certain that Huang Xiaolong would not easily kill them. But now, it seemed like they were mistaken.

When Huang Xiaolong counted ’two,’ the several Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders attacked. Godforce frantically surged out from their bodies, and their eyes turned scarlet as they leaped towards Huang Xiaolong with their most powerful attack.

"Fart of a Manor Lord, go to hell!" One of them bellowed madly, his face was distorted with anger and hate.

But when they got closer to Huang Xiaolong, several shadows flickered. Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er had parried their attacks. At the same time, the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders were thrown backwards.

Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er attacked them once again. Ghost fog flooded out and submerged the Grand Elders, and undulating screams of terror rang in the air. Seconds later, bloodied, gnawed, and unrecognisable corpses fell to the mountain.

The rest of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders stepped back in horror.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell on the remaining Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders and said, "I hope there is no next time, or else, I will not think twice before killing all of you."

Huang Xiaolong needed to teach these people an unforgettable lesson, as he was certain that they would betray him in case of conflict, if they ever encountered the Blue Spirit Gate in the future.

The remaining Grand Elders shook their heads heavily, and promised their loyalty to Huang Xiaolong.

However, Huang Xiaolong was unmoved by these people’s words. After everything was settled, Huang Xiaolong asked Gui Yi to pick all the Water Magic Fruits from the trees.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong generously gave each of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders two Water Magic Fruits.

A balance of reward and deterrence.

After all of the Water Magic Fruits were collected, the group flew further above the mountain ranges.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong’s group had left,the Blue Spirit Gate’s group flew into the same black hole.
