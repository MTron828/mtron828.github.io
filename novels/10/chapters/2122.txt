Chapter 2123: All-Heavens Treasury

“Lord Wan Shi lost?! He was defeated by Huang Xiaolong, who has only cultivated for slightly more than a thousand years?! B*llsh*t! You have to be lying!”

“It’s true... Countless eyes witnessed the battle. Wan Shi used all his energy to unleash the Great Purity Art and destroyed the city. Even experts like the Old Crow Ancestor, Shi Zhen, and the others perished! Huang Xiaolong managed to emerge unscathed before tossing out a lightning bead. The lightning bead sent Wan Shi flying for several hundred million miles!”

“I’ve heard that Wan Shi was thrown tens of billions of miles away! The World of Chaos was nearly torn into two by Huang Xiaolong! Wan Shi fled with his tail tucked between his legs, and he only managed to leave with the help of a high-grade escape talisman! If he had failed to run away, he would have died at Huang Xiaolong’s hands!”

Heated discussions broke out throughout the lands.

The Divine World, Devil World, Demon World, Radiance World, and the three worlds in Hell shook.

The Netherworld King’s Organization, Radiance Knight Corp, and the Heavenless Devil Legion broke out into celebration.

“Since Huang Xiaolong defeated Wan Shi, isn’t he the number one person under the heavens now?!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“No! There is another Heavenly Master from the Heavenly World. His strength is unfathomable, and even with the lightning bead, Huang Xiaolong might not be able to defeat him!”

“Other than the Heavenly Master from the Heavenly World, there should be no one else stronger than Huang Xiaolong!”

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they realized the changes that were about to happen in the myriad of worlds after this incident.

When discussions flew around, and everyone was still in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong met up with the little cow, the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, King of Darkness, and the Flying Devil Python as they left for Heavens Path.

Starlight spewed out from the Ancient Heavenly Court as it accelerated to an unimaginable level.

“I should refine the Ancient Heavenly Court to make it a supreme spiritual treasure...” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Even though it was already the top-ranked grandmist artifact, Huang Xiaolong felt that it was a little lacking after his battle with Wan Shi.

With the current strength of the Ancient Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t even be able to shatter the armor on Wan Shi’s body!

Moreover, with Huang Xiaolong’s constant increase in strength, the Ancient Heavenly Court was getting a little too slow for his liking.

If he managed to upgrade the Ancient Heavenly Court to a supreme spiritual treasure, its speed and offensive capabilities would improve by more than ten times!

Of course, not all grandmist artifacts could be upgraded to a supreme spiritual treasure. Only the grandmist artifacts like the Ancient Heavenly Court had the slightest chance of succeeding.

The Radiance Divine Scepter, Nine Yin Magic Mirror, and the City of Eternity were nearly impossible to upgrade.

Two days later...

A massive path appeared in the eyes of Huang Xiaolong and the others.

The path seemed to stretch on for eternity. Like an endless ancient snake that cut through the World of Chaos, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see the end of the path.

That was Heavens Path!

It was a road that led to a place beyond the 33 heavens!

It was the one and only path that existed since time immemorial!

Since the location of the All-Heavens Treasury wasn’t located too far away from the entrance of Heavens Path, Huang Xiaolong and the others managed to arrive half a day later.

Keeping the Ancient Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong and the others shot through the sky.

A city soon appeared before them, and the King of Grandmist opened his mouth to explain, “This is a heavenly country!”

After several days of recovery, along with the radiance energy Huang Xiaolong had poured into him, the King of Grandmist was nearly fully recovered.

There were countless heavenly countries located on Heavens Path. Every single one of them looked like a city, but if one were to look closer, they would see a separate space housed within the city-like structure itself. The size of space contained within each city was like an entire world surface!

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

He had managed to learn a lot about Heavens Path when he had searched through Wan Yue’s and Wan Zhuoyuan’s memories.

There were countless treasures hidden in Heavens Path. There were top-grade grandmist artifacts, origin treasures, peak-level martial arts, and much more. All experts from the 33 heavens who had broken through would try their luck over at Heavens Path!

Some of the stronger experts would manage to carve out a space for themselves in Heavens Path, leading to the formation of heavenly countries!

Generations after generations of inheritance, the power possessed by each heavenly country could shake the heavens! There were even some super heavenly countries hidden deep in Heavens Path that could rival the strength of the five greater worlds!

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived in the space above a specific heavenly country. According to Wan Yue’s memories, that was where the All-Heavens Treasury was located.

“Let’s go!” Huang Xiaolong separated the barrier surrounding the heavenly country, and he brought everyone into the city.

While Huang Xiaolong and the others went in search of the All-Heavens Treasury, a sorry figure appeared in a massive space lined with mountain peaks. The massive mountain range stretched on as far as the eyes could see, and cities stood tall around the towering mountains. Palaces formed clusters as spiritual beasts roamed the lands. Precious immortal trees could be seen strewn about the lands.

As the space around him fluctuated, the figure slammed into the ground.

You guessed it right, it was Wan Shi!

His bones were shattered as his skin was in tatters. The stream of blood trickling down from the side of his lips didn’t stop.

When a guard who was patrolling the area looked at him, he couldn’t help but scream in shock when he recognized the sorry figure. “Lord Wan Shi!”

“Quick! Take me to Senior Heavenly Master!” Wan Shi spat out another mouthful of blood after he spoke.

The guard nearly lost his wits as he supported Wan Shi towards the main palace.

Before long, they arrived at the entrance of one of the divine palaces.

The palace itself was carved out of a single piece of chaos essence stone. It went without saying that it was a priceless structure.

Two words were carved on a plaque above the main entrance. They seemed to originate from ancient times, and they read Heavenly Palace!

Heavenly Palace was the main palace in the Heavenly World. Wan Shi had arrived in the Heavenly World, a world higher than that of the myriad of worlds!

When Wan Shi arrived at the entrance, the entrance slowly opened. After staggering into the palace, a void filled his sights. There was nothing but an old man sitting in the air in the middle of the palace. Chaos qi danced beneath him, and it was as though his body was formed out of chaos qi itself. The only corporeal thing about him was his head.

As soon as Wan Shi appeared, the old expert opened his eyes, and the world seemed to lose its luster.

“Senior Heavenly Master!” Wan Shi greeted.

The old expert opened his mouth, and a low voice escaped his lips, “I know about everything that happened. You should go and treat your wounds in the Heavenly Lake.”

Wan Shi didn’t plan on leaving immediately as he spat, “I hope Senior Heavenly Lord can make a move to kill Huang Xiaolong!”

The Heavenly Master muttered resolutely, “I’ll leave seclusion in another three years. I still need some time to comprehend several other matters, but you do not need to worry. Three years later, I will personally deal with Huang Xiaolong. The day he dies will be the day Xiao Rong and Ah Chen will get married.”

After hearing that the Heavenly Master was going to take revenge for him, Wan Shi finally acknowledged and left the palace.

He quickly made his way to the Heavenly Lake after leaving the Heavenly Palace.

...

As they stared at the All-HeavensTreasury before them, Huang Xiaolong and the others felt a bomb going off in their heads.

Even for someone like Huang Xiaolong, who had seen the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s treasury, he couldn’t help but suck in a deep breath when he noticed the treasures in the All-Heavens Treasury.

“Pure Yang Rattan Fruit!”

“Five Lightning Incense!”

“Void Sword Dragon Heart!”

...

When Huang Xiaolong saw the sheer number of priceless treasures before him, he felt himself going dizzy. Of all the fifty or more origin treasures before him, none of them were in the first rank...

Level-two and level-three origin treasures... As long as he could name it, he could find it in the All-Heavens Treasury.

There wasn’t even a need to look at the treasures that couldn’t be found even if Huang Xiaolong flipped the myriad of worlds upside down. Just the origin treasures alone made the All-Heavens Treasury priceless.

The only thing that shocked them more was that all these origin treasures sitting in the All-Heavens Treasury were yet to mature. Even if he wanted to refine them, he had to wait for several thousands of years...
