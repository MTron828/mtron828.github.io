Without further delay, Guo Jun, Wangu Ziyi, as well as Xiang Li and his companions all strode out from the restaurant to confront Huang Xiaolong. They were led by the Guo Family’s disciple.

Guo Jun said, “Brother Xiang Li, and brothers, I want to kill Huang Xiaolong with my own hands!” Killing intent surged from Guo Jun’s body.

In the last twenty years, he had cultivated like a madman inside the Guo Family’s secret ground. He had supplemented his cultivation by using the Guo Family’s ancient treasures, and his strength had risen significantly to very peak of late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm due to this. It was only a matter of time for him to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Based on his talent and strength, even without his eight-tailed Silver Whale true body transformation, his battle power was comparable to an early First Order Ancestor God Realm master. Not to mention, if he were to transform into his eight-tailed Silver Whale true body, his could battle a mid-First Order Ancestor God Realm master!

Today, I am going to pay back the humiliation Huang Xiaolong has given me!

I will torture and then kill Huang Xiaolong!

That would wash away my shame!

The thin-faced young man Xiang Li said indifferently, “In that case, I’ll leave Huang Xiaolong to you. In truth, dealing with him ourselves would lowers our identities!”

“Big brother Xiang Li is right, that Huang Xiaolong is merely a puny Ancient God Realm disciple. It would indeed be uninteresting for several of us Ancestor God Realm masters to deal with him!” One of the young men agreed loudly.

As the group continued their conversation, they soon spotted another group walking in their direction. Guo Jun’s eyes immediately narrowed into malicious slits.

This group was led by none other than Huang Xiaolong. Guo Jun had been wishing to rip Huang Xiaolong into pieces for the last twenty years!

Hatred burned in Wangu Ziyi’s eyes the moment Huang Xiaolong entered his sight. There were also trepidation, jealousy, and a hint of exhilarated anticipation about Huang Xiaolong’s miserable sight being humiliated by Guo Jun and Xiang Li.

“That is Huang Xiaolong?” Xiang Li asked when he noticed Guo Jun’s expression.

“That’s him!” Guo Jun’s cold gaze was fixed on Huang Xiaolong and his steps quickened as if he was worried Huang Xiaolong would disappear in the blink of an eye.

On the other end of the street, Huang Xiaolong also saw Guo Jun, Wangu Ziyi, and the rest of their group. He was surprised at first, then the corner of his lips curved up in a cold sneer. However, his steps were unhurried, he strode leisurely towards Guo Jun’s group.

The little cow grinned playfully. “Hehe, this is going to be fun!”

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er were baffled, but hurried after Huang Xiaolong.

“None of you should make a move. Just Xiaolong and I are enough!” The little cow told Xu Baisheng and the others. She was afraid that they might rob her of her fun.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the others smiled wryly at the little cow’s words, but none of them dared to neglect her words. All nodded and complied with a ‘yes.’

They could naturally tell that the strongest person in the other group was only a late-First Order Ancestor God Realm. Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s strength was more than sufficient to deal with them.

In a few big strides, Guo Jun rushed to Huang Xiaolong. He stopped roughly ten meters away from him. His glare was as frosty as it could be, enough to freeze a cow to her death. He sneered and said, “Huang Xiaolong, we have quite the fate. I rarely come to the Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City, but luckily I happened to run into you today!”

“Fate?” Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders, “I don’t think so.” His gaze shifted onto Wangu Ziyi and Xiang Li, as if Guo Jun was irrelevant.

Even though he was inwardly surprised as to why Guo Jun would be in cahoots with Wangu Ziyi, his attention was focused on the thin-faced young man and the several young men beside him.

Huang Xiaolong sensed a mysterious energy inside these young men’s body. The divine elephant’s bloodline?

The bloodline power from these young men was weak, but he could sense it. Are these young men disciples of the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan?

“Huang Xiaolong, do you want to die?!” Guo Jun’s killing intent and fury exploded since Huang Xiaolong had ignored him. His momentum soared to the peak, and a silver-colored sphere formed above his head. The silver-colored sphere of light expanded in an instance, spreading in all four directions.

This was Guo Jun’s Silver Whale’s space!

Compared to the last time he had fought Huang Xiaolong, Guo Jun’s Silver Whale’s space had grown ten times bigger.

Within the Silver Whale’s space, air stopped flowing, and even time seemed to have slowed down.

Other than Xiang Li, the other Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s First Order Ancestor God Realm disciples, everyone felt a strong pressure bearing down on them! A pressure that had come from a higher strength!

The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s disciples quickly circulated their godforce only to realize that their godforce was circulating at a much slower speed than usual.

Xiang Li inwardly nodded with appreciation. Even he had to admit that Guo Jun was highly talented. Based on Guo Jun’s talent, once he would break through to Ancestor God Realm, one could imagine how strong his Silver Whale’s space could be.

Guo Jun threw his head back and bellowed after summoning the Silver Whale’s space. It sounded like a wrathful roar of an ancient Silver Whale. Thundering soundwaves reverberated throughout the entire royal city.

Then, Guo Jun began to change at a rapid speed. One after another long silver-colored whale tails grew out from his tailbone. At the same time, long bone spikes grew out from his arms and legs.

Guo Jun’s body grew several times bigger.

This sight shocked Wangu Ziyi. None of them had anticipated Guo Jun to straightforwardly transform into his eight-tailed Silver Whale true body! But a gleam of bloodthirst was shining in his eyes. It looked like Guo Jun had decided to defeat Huang Xiaolong in one strike—kill Huang Xiaolong without giving him a chance to resist!

Huang Xiaolong, your death is upon you!

Let’s see if you can still escape today!

Wangu Ziyi shouted with anticipation in his heart, when the eight-tailed Silver Whale Guo Jun struck at punch at Huang Xiaolong.

“Die—!”

“GO DIE FOR ME—!”

Guo Jun’s face was distorted, his eyes had turned scarlet like he had gone berserk.

But just as Guo Jun was one meter from Huang Xiaolong, he was suddenly unable to move, like there was an invisible barrier between him and Huang Xiaolong. No matter how hard he pushed forward, he was not even able to get an inch closer to Huang Xiaolong!

Wangu Ziyi, Xiang Li, and the others were dumbfounded for a second.

Guo Jun turned red. He let out a furious roar as he frenziedly circulated his entire body’s Silver Whale godforce. A silver light burst out from his fist that nearly blinded Wangu Ziyi’s sight. But his fist remained at the same spot.

Huang Xiaolong watched Guo Jun’s tireless efforts to punch, then shook his head and said, “In the last twenty years, you’ve only improved this bit? I’m so disappointed in you.” Huang Xiaolong lightly poked at Guo Jun’s fist, like poking at a bubble.

In the next moment, everyone saw Guo Jun flying backwards as if he was struck by a great impact. His speed seemed slower, however, with every passing second, a part of his flesh cracked open. The sharp spikes on his arms and legs, and the long curved fin from his head shattered inch by inch, disintegrating into silver dust.

Finally, Guo Jun smashed into a building at the end of the street, leaving a human-shaped hole in the wall.

Everyone could see Guo Jun violently spitting blood through the hole in the wall.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Wangu Ziyi, the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s several young men, including Xiang Li, sucked in a breath of cold air. Especially Wangu Ziyi felt like his heart was going to explode as it was beating too fast.

Guo Jun was defeated!

Miserably defeated!

Shit of a eight-tailed Silver Whale, that’s just a paper tiger!

Moments later, Xiang Li turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, and slowly stated, “You have broken through to Ancestor God Realm!”

Ancestor God Realm! Wangu Ziyi shuddered and felt like he was about to piss on himself.

In these twenty years, Huang Xiaolong had actually broken through to Ancestor God Realm! He was already an Ancestor God Realm!
