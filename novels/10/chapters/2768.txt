Chapter 2769: Auction

Several hours later, when Huang Xiaolong’s group was leaving the Saint Dao Bank, Huang Xiaolong was carrying more than 1.2 billion Tuoshen Holy coins on him.

Logically, the Purple Lightning Water, Stone of Black Abyss, Frozen Ice Heart, and Heavenly Earth Mud, each of these items could be purchased with one hundred million Tuoshen Holy coins, but to prevent unexpected circumstances, Huang Xiaolong exchanged more than one billion Tuoshen Holy coins, on top of the several hundred million that he already had.

Stepping out from the Saint Dao Bank, Huang Xiaolong’s group began looking for accommodation.

“Young Lord, there’s someone trailing us,” not long after leaving the bank, Duan Feng informed Huang Xiaolong through sound transmission.

“Don’t worry about them.” Huang Xiaolong looked placid. In truth, he had noticed it early on, and he knew that the person following them was from Nine Revolutions Sacred Land.

Looks like Chen Hong has set his sights on us? Huang Xiaolong sneered.

From Chen Qi, Huang Xiaolong already knew that Nine Revolutions had over five hundred Primal Ancestor Realm experts, but the majority of them were low-level Primal Ancestors. There were only twenty-plus Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestors and above.

If Chen Hong really came looking for trouble just because of one sentence, Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind annexing Nine Revolutions Sacred Land.

Later on, Huang Xiaolong’s group rented a small courtyard. In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong didn’t go anywhere and cultivated calmly. He sat cross-legged inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace, circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, and an amazing amount of holy spiritual energy rushed towards him, entering his body through every pore.

Huang Xiaolong’s body was akin to a bottomless abyss.

A giant dragon phantom coiled above the crown of Huang Xiaolong’s head, and every time its jaw opened, endless origin energy and grand dao energy rushed out from the void, resembling a great galaxial river.

The Cangqiong Holy World had the origin heart, so did the Divine Tuo Holy World. Moreover, the Divine Tuo Holy World’s origin heart was bigger, and it’s grand dao energy was of much higher quality, and it had even more completed grand dao laws.

A few days later, the day of the auction arrived and Huang Xiaolong stopped cultivating.

Although the grand dao energy inside him had increased during these few days of cultivation, Huang Xiaolong still felt like his progress was too slow. At this rate, it would probably take him a hundred years to enter Primal Ancestor Realm…

It would take him a hundred years to reach the Primal Ancestor Realm from the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm!

To others, this span of time might be a miraculous feat that was impossible to achieve, but to Huang Xiaolong, it was tortoise-speed progress.

Stepping out from his room, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the hall within moments. Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng, and Chen Qi were already waiting for him there.

“Xiaolong, I have good news for you. We got word a while ago that there will be a dozen grand dao pills for auction today,” Cangqiong Old Man smilingly told Huang Xiaolong the good news the moment he spotted Huang Xiaolong.

“Grand dao pill!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up, hearing that.

Grand dao pill that was effective even for Dao Venerable experts was many times better than any holy pills.

Holy pills’ efficacy on Huang Xiaolong had reduced greatly over time, including peak grade holy pills, and it was almost nonexistent. But grand dao pills could significantly raise Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed. Even low-grade grand dao pills would be extremely useful for Huang Xiaolong.

Despite the shocking price of grand dao pills, Huang Xiaolong estimated that he could still get his hands on them with the amount of Tuoshen Holy coins he had.

Moments later, Huang Xiaolong’s group of four left the rented courtyard, and headed to the auction venue.

Because the rented courtyard was merely a stone’s throw away from the auction venue, in a quick half an hour, they reached the auction venue. After paying the stipulated one hundred Tuoshen Holy coins, they smoothly entered the auction hall.

As it was an underground auction, the venue’s decoration was simple, and almost bland. There wasn’t even a chair to sit on. There was only a sturdy-looking auction stage.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the auction venue, the venue was already crowded with at least ten thousand people.

They found an obscure corner and waited for the auction to begin.

“Young Lord, it’s Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s young lord!” Chen Qi pointed out.

They had just found a place to wait when a group of people flew towards them from another corner of the venue. This group was none other than Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s young lord Chen Hong and his subordinates.

Huang Xiaolong watched with a placid expression. In these few days, Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s people had been staring at their courtyard. It was so obvious that it was hard not to notice. It seemed like Chen Hong was planning to deal with them.

Chen Hong wouldn’t make any move within the Saint Devil City, however, once they left the city, Chen Hong won’t have any restraints.

Chen Hong smiled as he stopped in front of Huang Xiaolong, “Little Brother, do you still remember me? I am Chen Hong, Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s young lord. A few days back, we met in front of the Saint Dao Bank.”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Chen Hong and said, “We met in front of the Saint Dao Bank? I don’t remember that. My memory is bad, so I can't remember every stray cat and mongrel I come across. As for that whatever Nine Revolutions Sacred Land, I have never heard of it.”

Since Chen Hong was targeting him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to feign courtesy.

Chen Hong stiffened. His original intention was to greet Huang Xiaolong and try to find out some information related to Cangqiong Sacred Land from his mouth. He hadn’t expected Huang Xiaolong to be so shameless.

Rage burned in Chen Hong’s chest.

“Presumptuous! Punk, how dare a mere True Saint like you speak to our Young Lord like that!” From behind Chen Hong, one of the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts sharply reprimanded Huang Xiaolong, pointing a finger at his face as he went on, “Get on your knees now and beg our Young Lord to spare your life! Otherwise!”

“Otherwise what?” Huang Xiaolong asked in a tepid tone.

“Otherwise, you will die a death worse than a mongrel! And the sacred land behind you will be annihilated because of you!” The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s expert sneered. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned cold, “Kneel down and slap your own face now, you might be able to save your own life, otherwise, I will destroy your body, and extract your soul to be refined day and night, letting you taste what it feels like to wish being dead than being alive!”

Chen Hong and the rest of the group blanked for a second, and then laughed while shaking their heads.

The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s expert laughed the loudest, “I really want you to destroy my body, and extract my soul, but the question is, can you?”

“I know you’re Huang Xiaolong from Cangqiong Sacred Land, and I also know that Cangqiong Sacred Land has recently annexed the Tang Dragon, Freezing Desert, Chufan, and Ice Blue Sacred Land. However, punk, don’t assume Cangqiong Sacred Land is invincible after annexing four other sacred lands. I don’t care what other forces you have backing you, but since you’ve offended me, Chen Hong, there’s only going to be one end for you and it’s death!”

“Of course, you might live if you kneel and beg now.”

“If your pleadings please me, I can forget your previous offenses.”

Huang Xiaolong raised his eyes and took another glance at Chen Hong as he responded, “The same sentence, I will return to you.”

Hearing that, Chen Hong looked at Huang Xiaolong and chuckled maliciously before he turned and left with his group without another word.

“Young Lord, that punk is too arrogant. We could have killed him on the spot just now!” This was the same expert, who had reprimanded Huang Xiaolong.

Chen Hong waved his hand. “There is no need to hurry. We’re at the Crimson Knife Commerce, and there would be a lot of hassle killing him here. Moreover, if the Saint Devil Sacred Land questions us, it is also going to stir up a lot of trouble. Let him be arrogant for now. We’ll deal with him after he leaves Saint Devil City.”

“Yes, Young Lord!”

As more and more people entered the venue, the auction began half an hour later.
