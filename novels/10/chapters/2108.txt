Chapter 2109: Trash Collector

When Huang Xiaolong and the others returned to the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s headquarters, they saw its dilapidated state. Palaces were ground to dust as debris floated around in space. Some of the structures were riddled with holes, and some were mere broken pillars standing in the open space.

Among the debris, Huang Xiaolong noticed the fragments of godheads left behind in a recent battle. The stench of blood in the air was fresh, and it belonged to the members of the Grandmist Emperor Palace Wan Shi had killed along the way.

When Wan Shi had attacked the Reverence Moon Old Man and the others, not a single member stationed in the Grandmist Emperor Palace had survived.

After looking at the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s ruined state, a chilly killing intent burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“Wan Shi!!! I’ll return this to you a hundredfold! You’ll pay for what you did to my Senior Brother and the rest!” Huang Xiaolong spat. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

For several years, Jiang Hong had stood at the top of the Divine World, and the number of experts who paid their respects to the Grandmist Emperor Palace couldn’t even be counted. Everything had turned into dust!

All of a sudden, Cang Mutian walked towards the main palace that was riddled with holes. The expression on his face turned solemn as he said, “It’s the Myriad Worlds Bamboo!”

Myriad Worlds Bamboo! It was the high-grade, level-four origin treasure that had allowed Wan Shi to break into the high-level Sovereign Realm!

The little cow rushed over, and she looked at one of the massive holes in the structure. Her expression sank as she muttered, “What a terrifying offensive ability. The Myriad Worlds Bamboo seems much stronger than before!”

In the past, she had seen the Myriad Worlds Bamboo in action. Even though it was strong, it couldn’t be compared to what she had just seen. If this was the old Wan Shi, he wouldn’t be able to destroy the main hall of the Grandmist Emperor Palace after the combined efforts of the Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist, King of Darkness, and Du Hai to reinforce it.

“Do you think the Myriad Worlds Bamboo will be able to break the defense of my Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden. He summoned the lotus as soon as he spoke, and all thirty-six petals appeared and revolved around him. As they emitted resplendent rays of green light, they stood ready to defend Huang Xiaolong from any attacks.

Even though there were a ton of things Huang Xiaolong could do with the thirty-six petals, the strongest aspect of the petals was their defensive capabilities.

As long as one refined a level-four origin treasure, they would be able to summon it whenever they wanted. For origin treasures lower than the fourth level, there was an extremely rare chance for the user to gain the ability to summon it. An example of such would be the Lotus of Darkness Huang Xiaolong had refined in the past.

“It’s pretty hard to make the comparison...” The little cow shook her head and explained, “Your Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus is a high-grade level-four origin treasure that underwent a transformation. Moreover, its main ability is to defend you. According to logic, it should be a little weaker than the Myriad Worlds Bamboo. Whatever the case, the Myriad Worlds Bamboo wouldn’t be able to break your defense with ease. Everything boils down to your cultivation level...”

Cang Mutian nodded, “She’s right. If you’re stronger than Wan Shi, there is no way for the Myriad Worlds Bamboo to break your defense!”

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he retrieved the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus.

It was at that moment that a whistling sound broke the silence as a huge group of experts charged towards the main hall.

“Wan Shi leveled the Grandmist Emperor Palace to the ground. Even though he couldn’t be bothered to pick up whatever remained of the treasury when he left, treasures are lying all around! All the disciples are to look for anything worth saving! You can’t keep it for yourself. Everything has to be handed over, and you will be rewarded accordingly when we get back!” The leader of the group, a skinny old man, ordered.

“We shall listen to Ancestor Zhen Tian!”

All the disciples quickly spread out as they started searching for treasures lying about.

When the little cow glanced over at them, she recognized them instantly, “It’s the members from the Evil Extermination Emperor Palace.”

The Evil Extermination Emperor Palace was ranked in the top hundred. It was comparable to the Gold Essence Emperor Palace Huang Xiaolong had taken care of previously.

Cang Mutian snorted, “It seems like there are a ton of trash collectors now that the Grandmist Emperor Palace is destroyed by Wan Shi...”

Of course, it was no surprise that people would be scavenging through the ruins of the Grandmist Emperor Palace after they had fallen. The Grandmist Emperor Palace was the number-one-ranked emperor palace in the Divine World. After Jiang Hong had gained control of the Divine World, the Grandmist Treasury had swelled once again. Since the treasures were scattered all around the remains of the emperor palace, everyone was ready to dig through the dirt to obtain some benefits!

One of the disciples from the Evil Extermination Emperor Palace flew towards Huang Xiaolong, and his eyes widened in shock.

“How can there be someone faster than us?” He gasped.

“They probably obtained all the treasures in this area. As long as we take them down and bring them to Ancestor Zhen Tian, he will be able to look through their spatial rings and snatch their treasures away!”

“Let’s do it!”

Several dozen disciples from the Evil Extermination Emperor Palace appeared suddenly and surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s party.

Before they could open their mouths to intimidate Huang Xiaolong to follow them back, the Flying Devil Python opened its mouth to swallow all of them whole.

When the other disciples saw what happened, they sucked in a cold breath.

“Quick! Notify Ancestor Zhen Tian!”

Several disciples took out their transmission symbol as they made the report.

It went without saying that Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother stopping them.

“What’s going on?” Ancestor Zhen Tian, who was stationed far away, quickly rushed over to meet with the group of disciples who made the report.

“Ancestor, that’s them! They killed senior brother Hu Yifei and the others!” One of the disciples pointed towards Huang Xiaolong as he spat in anger. “That python swallowed all of them without giving us a chance to tell them who we are!”

The ancestor’s expression sank, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong and the others. Hu Yifei was his youngest disciple. Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, he growled, “Who the h*ll are you? Which emperor palace are you from? Why did you kill my disciple? I hope that you can give my Evil Extermination Emperor Palace a proper explanation for your actions.”

It was clear he didn’t recognize Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, or Cang Mutian.

An indifferent expression remained on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he said, “You can scram. From now on, everyone who dares to look for treasures from the Grandmist Emperor Palace will die!”

Death!

The temperature in the space around all of them dropped several degrees when Huang Xiaolong pronounced the fate of the scavengers.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had the guts to call him to scram, the ancestor’s expression sank. Anger boiled in his heart as he chuckled, “Brat, do you really think you’re Lord Wan Shi?! I...”

Before he could complete his sentence, Huang Xiaolong reached out and pulled the ancestor over to him. Grabbing the old man by the neck, Huang Xiaolong raised him into the air as he spat coldly, “Lord Wan Shi? So what if I’m not Wan Shi?!” He clenched his fist, and the old man exploded into a mist of blood.

The disciples from the Evil Extermination Emperor Palace felt the blood draining from their faces as they stared at Huang Xiaolong with fear in their eyes.

“Get lost. Tell everyone who plans on coming here that I’ll kill them no matter who they are!” Huang Xiaolong growled, “If anyone has any problems with it, tell them to come and look for me, Huang Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong!

Rage was boiling in the hearts of the disciples from the Evil Extermination Emperor palace as they swore to take revenge for their ancestor. However, the anger in their hearts disappeared when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s name. In fact, some of them were so afraid that they nearly fainted.

In the blink of an eye, all the disciples started running.

Too lazy to deal with the disciples of the Evil Extermination Emperor Palace, Huang Xiaolong allowed them to leave with their lives.

“Let’s go. We shall head over to the Gold Essence Emperor Palace!” Huang Xiaolong and the others shot through the air as they raced towards the Gold Essence Emperor Palace. Since they had dared to hunt down the members of the Grandmist Emperor Palace, Huang Xiaolong planned on making them pay the price. He had sworn that he would take revenge for the disciples who suffered, and he wouldn’t stop until he exterminated every living being in the Gold Essence Emperor Palace!
