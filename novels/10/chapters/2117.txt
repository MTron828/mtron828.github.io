Chapter 2118: Killing Old Monster Lun Zhuan

When Wan Shi heard what Huang Xiaolong said, it was as though he had heard the joke of the century. He couldn’t hold back his laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think you can do that? Based on your thousand years of cultivation?! Hahaha! You have to be kidding me!” Wan Shi continued, “I’ll admit, your strength has increased really quickly! You actually managed to refine the high-grade, level-four Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus!”

“What?! High-grade, level-four origin treasure?!” Lun Zhuan and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Even the enforcers from the Heavenly World stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence.

Wan Yue, who was thrown into the wall by the shards of his axe, finally crawled to his feet. He glared at Huang Xiaolong with a trace of fear in his eyes. He had never thought that it was possible for Huang Xiaolong to fully refine the lotus in such a short span of time!

According to him, no matter how heaven-defying Huang Xiaolong’s talent was, it was impossible for anyone to refine the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus in less than several hundred thousand years.

Wan Shi glared at Huang Xiaolong, and he snapped, “So what if you did? Even if you’re in the mid-level Sovereign Realm, I can still kill you with a flip of my hand!”

The little cow and Cang Mutian rushed over to the King of Grandmist and the King of Darkness to stuff pills down their mouth.

Wan Shi ignored the two of them as he fixed his gaze on Huang Xiaolong.

According to him, no one could escape after he killed Huang Xiaolong. Even if they saved the two old men, he would settle them with a single strike later.

“Oh really?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the confident Wan Shi, and he sneered.

Lun Zhuan walked out from the crowd all of a sudden as he brandished the giant wheel in his hand. “Huang Xiaolong, Lord Wan Shi doesn’t need to dirty his hands by killing you. Since you can’t wait to be killed, I’ll fulfill your wish! Do you really think you can stand against our alliance of overlords?”

The Old Crow Ancestor, Heavenly Spirit Beast Master, Shi Zhen, and the two enforcers from the Heavenly World looked at each other before taking a single step forward.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at them from the corner of his eye as a smile formed on his face. “That’s fine with me. All of you can come at me together. After I deal with you, I’ll kill Wan Shi!”

The Heavenly Spirit Beast Master chuckled in amusement, “What arrogance! Huang Xiaolong, even if you enter the mid-level Sovereign Realm and become an overlord, I refuse to that believe so many of us can’t take you down!”

“Kill!”

The giant wheel in Lun Zhuan’s hand flew out towards Huang Xiaolong as he gave his order.

A massive stick appeared in the Old Crow Ancestor’s hand, and he smashed it towards Huang Xiaolong. The moment the stick came crashing down, it was as though the world itself collapsed. As for the two enforcers of the Heavenly World, they revealed giant swords in their hands as they slashed towards Huang Xiaolong. The Godly Mt. Xumi appeared as Shi Zhen sent it flying towards Huang Xiaolong.

Without moving his legs, Huang Xiaolong simply reached out with both his arms to send Lun Zhuan’s wheel flying. The rebound was so strong that it crushed the wheel before sending it into the ceiling of the All-Heavens Divine Palace.

Huang Xiaolong followed up with a fist to greet the Old Crow Ancestor’s stick. His punch sent the stick flying before landing on the Old Crow Ancestor himself. Drawing a cool arc through the hall, the Old Crow Ancestor crashed into the walls of the hall.

Looking at the two giant swords from the enforcers flying towards him, Huang Xiaolong grabbed the blade of the sword before twisting it sharply to the side. The swords shattered into a million pieces and the two of them spat out mouthfuls of fresh blood as they retreated.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong sent a palm strike towards the Godly Mt. Xumi. The treasure that was said to have the strongest defense faltered as the light barrier around it crumbled—cracks formed on the surface of the structure as a giant palm was imprinted on its side.

Shi Zhen was thrown out of the Godly Mt. Xumi, and the skin on his body split open.

With only one final opponent to deal with, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred as he disappeared from his spot. When the Heavenly Spirit Beast Master came crashing down onto the ground of the main hall, a bloody hole could be seen in his chest. It was clear that Huang Xiaolong’s punch had gone through his entire body.

Wan Yue was overwhelmed with fear when he saw the scene before him.

Six overlords were destroyed by Huang Xiaolong in the span of a single breath!

There was no need to mention how the enforcers of the Heavenly World, Xu Yang, and Liu Yunyun, were no ordinary Sixth Order Sovereigns!

How could this happen?!

The other world leaders and old freaks stared at the scene before them in shock. The blood drained from their faces as their bodies trembled like a leaf in the wind.

Wan Shi’s previously indifferent expression changed, and a look of surprise flashed through his eyes.

His pupils shrank when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate in the slightest. After he defeated all six of them, the Radiance Divine Scepter appeared in his hand as he sent it piercing through Lun Zhuan’s head.

In the Radiance World, he had nearly died because of Lun Zhuan’s sneak attack. Out of the six of them, he was hell-bent on killing Lun Zhuan.

When Lun Zhuan saw the Radiance Divine Scepter arriving before him, a look of despair appeared on his face. Luckily for him, a shockingly powerful force appeared beside him, and a green bamboo blocked the Divine Radiance Scepter.

Wan Shi had finally made a move!

A massive explosion resounded through the air when the Radiance Divine Scepter collided with the bamboo. It was as though two immovable objects had slammed into each other, and the hall shook violently. Unable to withstand the impact, the ground started to crack.

With the All-Heavens Divine Palace in the middle, the palaces around it started to crumble.

Some world leaders were even sent flying by the shockwaves of the blast. They exploded in mid-air, and blood mist filled the air.

When Lun Zhuan saw how Wan Shi had blocked off the Radiance Divine Scepter, he heaved a sigh of relief. However, a tiny chaos axe materialized above his head and chopped downwards before he could react. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Slice!

A horrifying sound pierced through the air as Lun Zhuan’s body was sliced from his head to his crotch.

Lun Zhuan’s eyes went wide as he lowered his head to look at the terrifying axe that had sliced through his body.

“I...” Before he could finish his sentence, his godhead and body shattered.

When Wan Shi blocked off the Radiance Divine Scepter, he felt a frighteningly strong surge of energy slamming into him as he retreated several steps. By the time he regained his footing, Lun Zhuan was already dead. His expression sank, and his face became as black as the thunderclouds in the sky.

“It seems like I underestimated you.” Killing intent burst out from Wan Shi’s eyes. “I was merely careless before. Huang Xiaolong, I had never thought that you would be at the peak of the late-Fourth Order Sovereign Realm... Regardless, you will die here today!”

“It’s been a while since I last used all my strength in a battle. Today, I will show you the extent of my abilities!”

The aura around Wan Shi’s body started to expand as rays of green light filled the surroundings around him. They slowly transformed into massive shoots of bamboo.

Every single one of them had its surface filled with mysterious runes. Runes that didn’t belong in this world... No, it was more accurate to say that they didn’t originate from this era!

“Xiaolong, be careful! That’s the Myriad Worlds Bamboo!”

“The Myriad Worlds Bamboo contains the power that transcends this era!”

The little cow screamed the moment the Myriad Worlds Bamboo appeared. At the same time, she grabbed the King of Grandmist and King of Darkness to beat a hasty retreat.

“Die!” Wan Shi’s frosty voice rang in Huang Xiaolong’s ears, and countless bamboo shoots shot towards Huang Xiaolong and those related to him.
