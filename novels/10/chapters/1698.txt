Desolate Giant Tai Yue stood high in the air, coldly looking at the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang and his allies.

There were more than two hundred experts from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Massacring Gods Gate, Howling Moon Wolf Race, Black Ant Clan, Demonic Bone Clan, and Gu Family by Shi Wushuang’s side. Other than Song Litao, Yi Qing, Gu Family’s young master, the rest were all Emperor Realm experts.

Close to two hundred and thirty Emperor Realm experts, and one-third of them were high-level Emperor Realm experts.

This lineup, although a bit exaggerated, could flatten everything in its path!

But deep down, Tai Yue knew that these were not all of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse, Massacring Gods Gate, and Howling Moon Wolf Race’s triad alliance. There had to be more high-level Emperor Realm experts hidden in the surrounding.

From the reports he had received, the number of experts hidden in the vicinity was no lesser than two hundred people!

Tai Yue, Jin Yuan, and the others seemed calm on the surface, but inwardly, they were anxious like ants on a hot pan.

Although the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s experts had also arrived at the Nethersea, and were hidden in the surroundings, the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s Senior and Junior Commanders numbered around two hundred plus.

Even counting the one hundred high-level Emperor Realm puppet Undead Netherguards, they still had less manpower compared to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s triad alliance!

Shi Wushuang stared icily at Tai Yue and the others, speaking in an indifferent voice, “Tai Yue, stop concealing your faces with some disguise techniques. I know it’s the four of you. Come one, we’re old friends, why won’t you welcome me with your true appearance?”

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse’s Patriarch, Shi Wushuang could recognize Tai Yue and the other three great commanders. This was naturally because he had seen Tai Yue, Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, and Wan Yutian, who were part of the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s Ten Great Commanders, and also battled with them several times in the past.

Hearing Shi Wushuang’s taunting words, Tai Yue and the others merely snorted but did not say a word.

Shi Wushuang was not angered at all by their attitudes. He clasped his hands behind his back and looked upwards at ‘Heaven.’ His eyes glimmered. He too was waiting for Huang Xiaolong to come out.

There were only a few hours left until the Holy Mountain disappeared.

There were no more disciples coming out from the Holy Mountain. It looked like all the surviving disciples had already exited.

Of course, there was still Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong was inside ‘Heaven’ at the moment.

Others also looked towards ‘Heaven’ following Shi Wushuang’s gaze, and for a moment, the Nethersea fell into silence.

Misty Palace’s female disciple You Fei whispered to He Jingyi, “Young Miss, I didn’t expect the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang to actually come personally to kill that Asura noble, that kid’s dead for sure!” There was obvious gloating in her voice at Huang Xiaolong’s impending predicament. For some inexplicable reasons, ever since the Yin Yang Restaurant, she didn’t have a good impression about that Asura noble.

He Jingyi sighed, “It’s a pity such a talent...”

In her opinion, as good as that Asura noble was, he wasn’t going to be able to leave the Nethersea alive.

Against an overwhelming stronger power, any amazing talent was useless.

“A pity indeed. That kid’s got thirty-six holy fruits on him. After he dies, those thirty-six holy fruits would be wasted. How good would it be if Young Miss could get and use those holy fruits?” The Misty Palace’s female disciple You Fei pouted her mouth, feeling disgruntled.

The holy fruits had a very strange attribute. It was only effective when consumed by those who cleared the floors’ obstacles. If they were consumed and refined by others, its effects were no different than any other spiritual fruit.

In the far distance, one of the Fengdu City’s Ancestors told Qin Huangzhong, “Young Castellan Lord, that kid must have gotten grandmist treasure and numerous top-grade grandmist spiritual pills. Are we going to watch them fall into the hands of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Massacring Gods Gate, and Howling Moon Wolf Race and do nothing?”

Qin Huangzhong answered seriously, "Let’s wait and see first, but Lord Father has said unless necessary, we do not need to get involved."

Although grandmist treasure was tempting, Qin Huangzhong was aware that it wasn’t easy to grab.

A grandmist treasure was a hot potato; even if you got your hands on it, it was no different than putting a target on your back. It was not worth the risk of being besieged from all directions.

The people outside discussed between themselves, and each party harbored different intentions while Huang Xiaolong fully concentrated on absorbing the holy light’s energy inside ‘Heaven.’

......

Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, and two rays of light shot out from his eyes, seeing past through the ‘Heaven’ and layers of space. In the same instant, heaven and earth seemed to light up. The experts above the Nethersea felt a sharp pain in their eyes from a sudden glaring light but it disappeared almost instantly, and everyone’s sight recovered.

“What did just happened?!”

“What was that glaring light?”

The experts below were in ruckus.

Patriarch Shi Wushuang’s eyebrows creased into a faint frown. He had a feeling that this extreme glaring light was somehow related to that Asura noble.

That light seemed to contain the brightest radiance energy of heaven and earth, this energy was the bane of all evil and darkness.

At this time, a complex expression flitted across Huang Xiaolong’s face as he checked his internal condition.

Sixteen wings condensed from holy light energy!

This...! Huang Xiaolong felt a little speechless.

But Huang Xiaolong had gained knowledge after refining and absorbing the holy light energy. The Holy Mountain and Heavenly Hall were actually an inheritance left behind by a supreme expert. The person who passed through the twelfth floor of the test, refined and absorbed the holy light energy could inherit the supreme expert’s inheritance.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know the identity of this supreme expert, except that he was related to the Radiance World.

Apart from the Divine World, Hell, Devil World, Demon World, and Buddha World, the Radiance World was the strongest among the hundred millions of worlds which says a lot about the Radiance World’s strength.

‘Looks like a trip to the Radiance World is inevitable,’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

The supreme expert had left the other half of the inheritance in the Radiance World—only after obtaining the other half would the inheritance be considered as complete.

Huang Xiaolong stood up from the floor and flew deeper into the Heavenly Hall.

Now, Huang Xiaolong had already advanced to the mid-Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. With a flap of his sixteen radiance wings, he accelerated forward at an astonishing speed—slightly faster than the speed after he transformed into a primordial divine dragon.

This was still the first time Huang Xiaolong used his radiance wings. As Huang Xiaolong familiarized himself with his sixteen radiance wings, his speed increased further.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong saw a huge altar up ahead of him, and there was only a scepter. A scepter brimming with extreme radiance. Around the altar in the air, stood fourteen Radiance Angels!

Two of these fourteen Radiance Angels had fourteen wings! The remaining twelve Radiance Angels had twelve wings!

The two Radiance Angels with fourteen wings had the strength of a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, while the remaining twelve Radiance Angels were all late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm!

A late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm twelve-winged Radiance Angel’s battle power was definitely stronger than the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Undead puppet Netherguard.

“Greetings, Master!” Right when Huang Xiaolong reached the altar, the fourteen Radiance Angels knelt down with excited faces and saluted Huang Xiaolong with utmost respect. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong nodded and had them stand up.

These fourteen Radiance Angels were subordinates cultivated by the supreme expert in the past. For so many years, these Radiance Angels had been waiting loyally in this Heavenly Hall, guarding the inheritance.
