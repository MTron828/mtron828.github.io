Chapter 348: Beast God Scepter

Huang Xiaolong’s aura spread out like the waves of an endless sea, rolling and splashing, drowning everything.

Everyone in the grand hall choked at the whelming pressure. Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were both shocked, they swiftly projected their own battle qi out to cast a protective barrier over Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others to keep them from being affected too much.

“Saint realm!” At the same time, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu blurted out in unison.

Saint realm!

Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s exclamation echoed in Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohai, and the others’ ears, sending a shiver down their backs. Eyes widened a second later staring at Huang Xiaolong as their mind registered the meaning of those two words.

Sain-, Saint realm?!!!

The whelming pressure merely lasted a second before it receded faster than the evening tide, converged inside Huang Xiaolong’s body. The atmosphere returned to its previous serenity, causing everyone to feel like that split second pressure they experienced was nothing but an illusion.

The instant Huang Xiaolong converged his aura, in Guo Manor’s secret chamber, Guo Chen suddenly opened his eyes. In a flicker he appeared high above the Guo Manor, his alert eyes scanning all directions.

“Strange, I definitely felt a Saint realm warrior’s aura just now, how did it disappear without a trace?” Guo Chen muttered to himself. “That aura absolutely doesn’t belong to Duanren or that several old fellas. Could it be that some other unknown Saint realm expert has arrived in Duanren Imperial City?”

The same time Guo Chen was exploring the situation above the Guo Manor, above the Duanren Imperial Palace, Emperor Duanren was performing precisely the same actions, scanning the area with his spiritual sense, but just like Guo Chen, it was fruitless. In the end, Emperor Duanren flew back into the palace feeling puzzled.

When Guo Chen landed back in Guo Manor, Guo Shiwen approached carefully and asked due to Ancestor’s strange actions, “Ancestor, just now you...?”

Guo Chen explained, “Just now, I felt a Saint realm expert’s energy fluctuation, close to the Southern Hill Estate’s direction, but just as I came out, it vanished.”

In the Southern Hill Estate’s direction? Guo Shiwen was taken aback, then a thought struck his mind. Without thinking, he blurted out, “Ancestor, could it be that Senior Huang broke through the Saint realm?”

Guo Chen was stumped for the briefest second before shaking his head with a soft chuckle, “Absolutely not possible, it is too difficult to break into the Saint realm, I know from experience. As heaven-defying as Huang Xiaolong’s talent is, there’s no way he could advance into the Saint realm so fast.”

Guo Shiwen pondered his Ancestor’s words; the Ancestor had cultivated for several hundred years, only managing to break through to Saint realm a few years ago after many hardships. Indeed, no matter how gifted Huang Xiaolong was, breaking into the Saint realm at this speed was a fantasy.

“Ancestor, in your opinion, according to Senior Huang’s cultivation speed, how long will it take him to step into the Saint realm?” Guo Shiwen asked.

Guo Chen thought for a moment, answering: “Within five years’ time, he probably could.” In Guo Chen’s mind, Huang Xiaolong needed at least five years’ time to reach that point.

...

At this time, in the Southern Hill Estate’s grand hall, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were smiling ear to ear, taking a step forward to kneel down on single knee. Saluting towards Huang Xiaolong, their sonorous voices rang: “Congratulations Young Lord on advancing to the Saint realm!”

Their Sovereign had broken into the Saint realm! This would greatly increase the Sovereign’s chances in fighting for the Asura’s Gate position later, therefore, both of them were extremely happy.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, smiling, “Rise.” Advancing to the Saint realm also put Huang Xiaolong in a good mood. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu stood up.

By this point, Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohai, and the orders finally recovered from their shock, each was happy and excited, with Huang Peng declaring to the Southern Hill Estate to hold a celebration feast for three days and three nights.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, consenting to his father’s enthusiasm. He told Zhao Shu to reward the estate’s servants, slaves, and guards of Houtian strength a thousand gold coins each, and the Xiantian realm warriors fifty thousand gold coins each, on top of a three-day celebration banquet.

Still, Huang Xiaolong cautioned Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu not to disclose the fact that he had broken into the Saint realm. At this point in time, Huang Xiaolong preferred not to expose his strength to preying forces outside.

In the next few days, other than refining Ghost King Dans and Geocentric Buddha Elixir, practicing the Godly Xumi Art, Asura Tactics, and the Body Metamorphose Scripture to stabilize his new realm. He also allocated time to practice the Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra.

The exalted Eminent Holiness was the strongest Saint King’s Junior Brother back in the day. Not to mention that this Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra was a powerful skill, this was something Huang Xiaolong experienced when battling Zhao Chen.

The Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra contained a total of nine moves, and even Huang Xiaolong felt strained to display the last three moves before. Now, trying again after entering the Saint realm was much easier.

On this particular day, Huang Xiaolong stood in the middle of his yard, holding a scepter in his hand, fiddling with it back and forth. This scepter was one of the items he took from the grass huts in the Eminent Holiness’ hidden space dwelling.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong would occasionally take the scepter out to study, hoping to find some clues from it. The feeling that this scepter held secrets persisted inside him. It was just that he had yet to get any results.

He tried many ways so far, including dripping blood on it, trying to refine the scepter, but there wasn’t the slightest change.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze was fixed on the beast head carving decorating the top of the scepter when Zhang Fu walked in, wanting to report his findings on the Origins Forest when he caught sight of the beast scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. Zhang Fu’s actions halted due to shock, eyes widened, “This? Beast God Scepter?!”

Huang Xiaolong turned around, looking at Zhang Fu: “Beast God Scepter?”

Zhang Fu approached to get a closer look at the scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, requesting permission, “Sovereign, may I have a look?”

Huang Xiaolong passed the beast-ornamented scepter to Zhang Fu.

Zhang Fu’s hand trembled a little when he reached out to receive the scepter. Studying the scepter carefully, the more he looked the more excited he became, his mouth mumbled incessantly, “It’s really the Beast God Scepter! Really, really!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect Zhang Fu to recognize this scepter, but he did not rush him, he believed that Zhang Fu would explain to him in a while.

A short while later, Zhang Fu calmed down, returning the scepter to Huang Xiaolong with both hands respectfully, while inquiring with care, “Sovereign, may I ask where you found this God Beast Scepter?”

Huang Xiaolong took back the scepter, answering Zhang Fu frankly, “I found this scepter at the bottom of Broken Tiger Rift in the dwelling left behind by the Eminent Holiness from the ancient era, but I don’t know the origin of this scepter.”

Eminent Holiness? Evidently, Zhang Fu had not heard of Eminent Holiness’s name. He said, “Sovereign, this scepter is very likely the legendary Beast God Scepter, holding the highest authority in the Beastmen race. It was said that in ancient times, a Beast God emerged from the Beastmen race, subjugating hundreds of the Beastmen tribes. Not only did this Beast God create a Beastmen empire, he led the Beastmen to unify the Ten Directions Continent.”

“Unified the Ten Directions Continent!” Huang Xiaolong was surprised.

In the ancient times, there were strong experts everywhere, to unify the Ten Directions Continent was a hundred times harder than unifying the current Snow Wind Continent, yet this Beast God actually succeeded!

Reverence shone from Zhang Fu’s eyes as he went on, “Yes, at that time, the Beastmen race led by the Beast God was extremely powerful, so much that the six ancient kings of the human race led by the Saint King had to tread carefully when facing the Beast God. But later, the Beast God disappeared without a reason, and this Beast God Scepter was the scepter held by the Beast God during that time. Not only does it represent the highest authority in the Beastmen race, it is also the symbol of supreme power on the Ten Directions Continent.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the scepter in his hand with astonishment.

Zhang Fu added, “There is another myth linked to this, anyone who can find the Beast God Scepter and grasp it’s secret, they will be able to comprehend the Beast God’s power.”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows scrunched together, to comprehend this Beast God’s Power was easier said than done. These days, he tried many different methods that garnered no reaction at all from the scepter.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Zhang Fu said, “Sovereign, on the Ten Directions Continent, there is a place called Beast God Shrine, a monument left behind by the Beast God and a place that only the Beast God Scepter can open. In the future, Sovereign can make a trip to the Beast God Shrine, perhaps at that time there will be an opportunity, allowing Sovereign to comprehend the Beast God Scepter.”
