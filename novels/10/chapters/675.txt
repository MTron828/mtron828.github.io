“Old man, is that tablet this Royal Pill House’s privilege card?” Huang Xiaolong inquired curiously seeing that the old man’s black tablet was enough to terrify the restaurant owner to the point of kneeling.

The Ascending Moon Old Man waved his hand in an offhand manner, saying, “It was given to me in the past by one the Royal Pill House’s owners. If it weren’t because this thing is made from Black Phoenix Wood, I’d have thrown it away long ago.”

“Black Phoenix Wood!” Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei stared at the black tablet in surprise.

Black Phoenix Wood was a type of very expensive wood from the Divine World.

The Black Phoenix Tree was the place where the divine beast Black Phoenix nested. Over a long period of time, the tree was imbued the Black Phoenix’s vital qi, becoming invulnerable to water and fire. The Black Phoenix’s vital qi contained within could improve one’s physical body when keeping it close.

In the Divine World, this Black Phoenix Wood may not be valuable, but in the lower realm it was extremely precious. It was something that couldn’t be bought even if one had money.

The Ascending Moon Old Man was nonchalant despite Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei’s surprised faces, “This thing is not as precious as the two of you think.” As he spoke, he opened the jug of Royal Pill Wine that Deng Caizhi sent over. A tantalizing scent of wine immediately wafted out.

This wine scent made Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei feel rejuvenated and comfortable deep into their souls.

“Kid, to tell you honestly, this Royal Pill Wine is brewed from one thousand kinds of spirit pellets.” Watching the two youngsters’ reactions, the old man once again spoke with a complacent expression on his face. “And all of them are saint grade and above spirit pellets!”

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely shocked. One thousand kinds of saint grade and above spirit pellets!

He was shocked about this fact, but even more shocked at the price of this wine!

One must know that the price of one sacred grade and above spirit pellet was not lower than one saint grade spirit stone.

One thousand pellets... wasn’t that equivalent to one thousand sacred grade spirit stones? Then, how much did one jug of wine cost?!

Shi Xiaofei’s line of thought went in the same direction as Huang Xiaolong’s, dumbstruck by the one thousand kinds of sacred grade spirit pellets and the price.

The old man laughed, “Frightened? But, this Royal Pill Wine is not as expensive as you think. Although it was brewed using one thousand kinds of sacred grade and above spirit pellets, it is merely one-tenth of a pellet, or two-tenths of a pellet at most. As for the price, it’s ten million Xuanwu coins per jug.”

Ten million Xuanwu coins for one jug!

Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless. This old man had the cheek to say that it wasn’t expensive.

Purchasing a residence in the Cloudsea Mainland was around one billion, so buying a hundred jugs of this Royal Pill Wine was like getting a residence in the Black Warrior City!

With this kind of price, even those super forces’ Elders that had one billion on them would think thrice before coming here. If one jug of wine was already ten million Xuanwu coins, one could hardly do much with a mere one billion here.

Huang Xiaolong took a quick glance around at the nearly full premise and inwardly shook his head, it seems like there were many rich people in this world.

While Huang Xiaolong took a quick glance, customers around them were also furtively observing the people at Huang Xiaolong’s table.

A simple show of hand was worth billions of Xuanwu coins and piles of saint grade spirit stones, comparable to prominent families inside the Royal Pill City.

What caught these people’s attention was that black tablet the old man took out, what exactly was that? That black tablet with the single ‘pill’ character actually frightened the Royal Pill House’s owner to the point of kneeling respectfully toward the old man just like a slave as he personally served the wine to the old man’s table; bending his waist low with a flattering smile! Usually, even their Royal Pill City’s Castellan needed to speak politely with the owner.

Hence, they were even more curious about this beggar-like old man’s identity.

But it was if the Ascending Moon Old Man did not notice the curious stares directed at him. Raising the wine bowl to his mouth, he drank a mouthful and smacked his lips in appreciation, “It’s still that flavor, still as good! If there was no Royal Pill Wine, coming to Royal Pill City would be meaningless!” Finished saying that, disregarding his image, the old man used his sleeve to wipe the wine stained on his beard.

Huang Xiaolong felt it funny watching the old man’s intoxicated expression, but he was very interested in how this Royal Pill Wine tasted, if it was really as good as the old man’s praises.

Picking up the jug, Huang Xiaolong filled his wine bowl, raised it, and took a mouthful.

As the liquid entered his mouth, it felt smooth and fragrant. The aftertaste made one reluctant to put it down. His entire body’s pores opened in delight.

Huang Xiaolong was at a loss for words to describe this feeling. Comparing to all the wines he had tasted before with this Royal Pill Wine, the difference was like heaven and earth.

Ten million for a jug was well worth it!

The current Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid of spending money, only afraid that there was no place for him to spend.

After he broke through to Seventh Order, becoming a high-level God Realm cultivator, he could already condense the spiritual energy from the void into saint grade spirit stones.

Shi Xiaofei usually didn’t drink, but looking at Huang Xiaolong’s reaction, she was intrigued, thus pouring some into her wine bowl and taking a small sip. Her expression was no different than Huang Xiaolong’s.

“How is it? The wine your Master recommend is not bad, right?” The Ascending Moon Old Man smiled smugly looking at Huang Xiaolong.

In Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, no matter how he looked at it, the old man was asking for a beating. Despite that, Huang Xiaolong honestly answered: “It’s very good.”

This Royal Pill Wine could be considered the king of wine.

“Old man, this Royal Pill Wine, can we buy and take it away?” Huang Xiaolong added a question.

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s face split into a grin, “Why? You want to buy all the Royal Pill Wine here?” He did not answer Huang Xiaolong immediately, making a show of enjoying a mouthful of wine and swallowing slowly before answering, “We can take it away.”

Huang Xiaolong was elated.

At this point, the Ascending Moon Old Man added another sentence, “But, every person can only take away one jug.”

Every person can only take away one jug!

The elated Huang Xiaolong was instantly deflated. Then he glared angrily at the Ascending Moon Old Man opposite him; it was obvious this old man did that on purpose, speaking half a sentence, making him feel happy for nothing.

The Ascending Moon Old Man ignored Huang Xiaolong’s piercing gaze, “This is the Royal Pill House’s rule, nobody can break it. Regardless who comes in, every person can only order one jug.”

Huang Xiaolong was astounded.

“You kid think this Royal Pill Wine is so easy to brew? Just those one thousand sacred grade and above spirit pellets require untold amounts of elixirs, how many hours do alchemists needs to spend refining them?” The Ascending Moon Old Man rolled his eyes at Huang Xiaolong’s ignorance, then the old man suddenly smiled, “But with this tablet, an exception can be made. With this, everyone can order and take away two jugs!” He waved the black tablet in front of Huang Xiaolong, looking smug and triumphant.

Huang Xiaolong felt a strong impulse to punch that face.

In the next moment, however, the noise inside the restaurant rose as the customers discussed something that caught Huang Xiaolong’s interest. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At a table in the far corner, four people were talking about the upcoming Alchemist Grandmaster Competition.

“Have you all heard? The Azure Dragon Institute Principal’s personal disciple, Xiang Mingzhi, got his hands on the Azure Dragon Divine Fire!”

“Azure Dragon Divine Fire?! One of the four great divine flames, the Azure Dragon Divine Fire?!”

“That’s it! The news spread that not only did Xiang Mingzhi acquire the Azure Dragon Divine Fire, but he completely integrated with the divine flames. He is here with the Azure Dragon Institute Principal to participate in the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition. In my opinion, the Pill King of this term is none other than him!”

Each term’s first place winner was given the title Pill King.
