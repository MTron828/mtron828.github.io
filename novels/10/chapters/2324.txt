Chapter 2325: I Admire You So Much

Everyone stared at Wu Ge in shock.

The order was actually given by the Grand Hall Master of the Holy Heavens!

The person who had ordered the Law Enforcement Hall to maintain order in the plaza was Wu Ge! He was the one who had prohibited anyone from interrupting Huang Xiaolong’s examination!

Even the Holy Princes couldn’t believe what they heard.

“Mas... Master, I, I didn’t know you gave the order....” Xie Yao stammered as he tried to explain himself.

“Do you think that you can do what you want and ignore the rules just because the order didn’t come from me? Do the rules of the Holy Heavens not apply to you?!” Wu Ge growled.

Wu Ge didn’t stop, and Xie Yao’s expression turned unsightly as he kneeled down in fright. “Master, disciple doesn’t have those intentions. I was merely trying to protect the reputation of our Holy Heavens!”

Li Chen backed him up as well, “That’s right, Grand Hall Master Wu Ge. Junior Brother Xie Yao didn’t mean any disrespect. He only had the interests of our organization at heart. Please pardon Junior Brother Xie....”

As if he hadn’t heard Li Chen, Wu Ge continued, “After this, head to the Law Enforcement Hall and accept any punishment the Hall Master sees fit!”

All the core disciples stared at Wu Ge in shock.

Back then, Li Chen had comprehended the eleventh sacred stele, becoming a direct disciple of one of the ancestors. He was the number one disciple in the Holy Heavens, and his status was comparable to the clouds in the sky. Even after he spoke for Xie Yao, Wu Ge ignored him and insisted on Xie Yao’s punishment!

This!

Everyone’s gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong and something in their mind seemed to click.

Could it be?!

Wu Ge no longer bothered with the other Holy Princes, and he approached Huang Xiaolong. His originally cold expression changed and a bright smile appeared on his face. “Wu Ge congratulates Young Master Huang Xiaolong on comprehending the twelfth sacred stele. You are the first disciple to comprehend the twelfth stele since the creation of the Holy Heavens!”

Li Chen and the rest stared Wu Ge, and they didn’t believe their eyes.

“Success...Successful in comprehending everything?!” Fu Yunjie’s eyes widened as his brain short circuited.

Immediately after, Fu Yunjie’s body started to tremble. Grand Hall Master Wu Ge said that....

Yes, yes, yes!

Huang Xiaolong had comprehended the twelfth sacred stele!

It wasn’t fake! Huang Xiaolong didn’t cheat!

Everything was true!

The bodies of Li Chen, Xie Yao, Lin Jiayi, and everyone present trembled violently as they looked at Huang Xiaolong in amazement. Their expressions changed and even Li Chen couldn’t believe what he just witnessed.

The face of Xie Yao, who had wanted to stop Huang Xiaolong’s examination, changed from green to red, and back to green, and it flickered with all the colors of the rainbow.

At this time, Yu Mingjiang stepped forward and said excitedly, “Congratulations Young Master Huang Xiaolong on comprehending the twelfth sacred stele! This is a blessing for our organization! No! It’s a blessing for our Holy World”

He then proceeded to continue listing out many more blessings.

It was true that Huang Xiaolong’s appearance was a blessing for the Holy Heavens, as for the Holy World....

Fu Yunjie, Feng Yuanyuan, and the others were dumbfounded when they saw Yu Mingjiang’s behavior. He was basically worshipping Huang Xiaolong and the only part left was to kneel before Huang Xiaolong and kiss his feet.

At this time, Du Chengrui stepped forward and started crying in joy as he hugged Huang Xiaolong’s thigh, “Young Master Huang Xiaolong, I, I...I!”

What the fu.... Du Chengrui didn’t know what to say, as Wu Ge and Yu Mingjiang had already spoken too much.

“I admire you too much!” After thinking for a solid minute, he forced something out of his mouth.

Seeing the usually stern and serious Yu Mingjiang and Du Chengrui, Zhou Ruo didn’t believe her eyes.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he looked at the two of them. Wasn’t it just comprehending the twelve steles? Why were they acting as though he had saved their entire families from extermination?! What? Was it because he had comprehended all twelve steles in six minutes?

Clasping his fist, Huang Xiaolong bowed awkwardly. “The three of you don’t have to act this way. Isn’t it just comprehending the twelfth sacred steles? There’s nothing special about it.”

Even though he was being sincere, Wu Ge, Yu Mingjiang, and the others felt a thousand horses pounding through their heart when they heard what he said.

Nothing special about comprehending the twelfth saint stele?

What is he talking about?!

Wu Ge smiled bitterly, “Young Master Huang, you might think it’s nothing, but it’s a miracle for the rest of us!”

Yu Mingjiang added quickly, “That’s right, that’s right! Young Master Huang’s talent is unparalleled! Comprehending the twelfth stele might mean nothing to you, but for the rest of us, we might not be able to do it even if we spend all our life on it!”

Zhou Ruo widened her eyes in shock. Today, she found out that her stern-faced boss was actually really too d*mn good at flattery!

Huang Xiaolong laughed when he heard what she said.

“Young Master Huang, you must be exhausted after the test. Why don’t you rest inside the manor?” Wu Ge asked Huang Xiaolong with a thousand-watt smile on his face..

As the Grand Hall Master in the Holy Heavens, he asked for someone’s permission to invite them into the manor! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

From the time he started talking to Huang Xiaolong, his smile never faded.

Seeing Wu Ge’s hospitality, Huang Xiaolong contemplated for a moment before nodding his head, “Alright.”

Wu Ge was overjoyed when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s agreement. “Young Master Huang, please!” Afterwards, he led the way and invited Huang Xiaolong and Di Huai into the manor.

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t feel anything from Wu Ge’s act of hospitality, Di Huai was extremely flattered. He felt as though he was floating on cloud nine.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong and Di Huai being escorted by Wu Ge and Yu Mingjiang, the faces of Li Chen, Xie Yao, and the others turned complicated.

A surge of panic and terror that Fan Xia had never felt before surged through his heart.

When all that was happening, a group of people rushed towards Huang Xiaolong’s original courtyard.

And the one leading the group was Holy Prince Chen Gong of the Greenwood Holy Gate.

One of the subordinates besides Chen Gong laughed, “Master Chen Gong, if we capture Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate and hand them over to Fu Yunjie, I’m sure he would be elated.”

Chen Gong nodded his head and smiled. It was indeed a good opportunity to please Fu Yunjie and get on the True Reason Holy Gate’s good side.

Ever since Fu Yunjie had managed to comprehend the seventh sacred stele and become an inner disciple of the Holy Heavens, Chen Gong had been thinking of ways to please Fu Yunjie. When he knew that Fu Yunjie wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong, he quickly gathered all his subordinates and led them to the courtyard Di Huai rented.
