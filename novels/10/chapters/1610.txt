Gu Chengfeng laughed madly and lashed out his long whip again. The long whip was like a venomous viper as it curled up and caught dozens of passers-by by the waist. When he retracted his long whip, they were snapped in half.

The scent of blood permeated through the air.

Even though everyone was terrified, none of them dared to run away.

Gu Chengfeng laughed, “These lowly peasants are pretty smart. When those peasants ran away the last time, I hunted down all their families and used them as whipping practice!”

“The more blood my extermination whip absorbs, the stronger it becomes. At that time, the power of my Extermination Whip Art will naturally increase.”

Gu Chengfeng withdrew his whip and stroked it as a brilliant smile broke out on his face.

“Young Master Gu Chengfeng, I heard that Young Master Xin Bo from the Asura Gate has returned!” One of the guards stepped forward and said cautiously.

Gu Chengfeng’s face turned frosty as he sneered, “He was just lucky enough to pass the examination of a small branch of the Asura Gate in the Brookspring Plane. He’s just an outer sect disciple... If he dares to act arrogantly in front of me, watch me take care of him!”

“Yes, yes, how can that Xin Bo compare to Young Master Gu Chengfeng? He is merely a First Order Ancient God Realm cultivator, if Young Master Gu Chengfeng wants to take care of him, it is as simple as saying a word.” That guard fawned.

“That’s right. If our Young Master were to participate in the Asura Gate Brookspring branch examination, he would pass easily! Moreover, the Elder would definitely accept him as a direct disciple!”

“Young Master will definitely be favoured by an Elder for sure!”

Gu Chengfeng’s underlings agreed one after another.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart was moved as he heard the information.

Brooksprings Plane?

Asura branch Sect?

Before coming he had done some research and roughly understood the power distribution in the Hell Asura World.

In the Hell Asura World, there weren’t as many Emperor Palaces like the Divine World. Instead, there were only some ancient sects and family clans with long heritage. The power they held wasn’t inferior to the Emperor Palaces in the Divine World.

There were seven to eight thousand ancient sects and family clans in the list of superpowers in the Hell Asura World. However, the Asura Gate was one of the top ten strongest superpowers in the whole of the Hell Asura World, controlling countless Galaxies and Divine Planes.

From the looks of things, it seemed that the Brookspring Plane he was on currently, was one of the many Divine Planes that the Asura Gate controlled.

At this moment, Gu Chengfeng and his guards made their way towards Huang Xiaolong.

What?!

Gu Chengfeng was surprised to see Huang Xiaolong, a noble, in the middle of the street.

He stopped and greeted Huang Xiaolong, “Friend you must not be from our city right?”

Huang Xiaolong remained expressionless and he replied indifferently, “What do you want?”

Gu Chengfeng was dumbfounded and rage flashed through his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression and tone made him feel as if he was trying to stick his warm face on the other party’s cold buttocks.

The guards behind him were furious as well.

“You punk, do you know who our Young Master is? Not only is our Young Master a disciple of the Gu family, he is also one of the core disciples there!” One of the guards stared coldly at Huang Xiaolong and continued, “So what if you are a noble of the Asura Race? Even if the Asura Gate’s disciple, Xin Bo, comes to the Brookspring Plane, he will still need to greet our Young Master as his big brother!”

Even though Huang Xiaolong was disguised as a noble form the Asura Race and was protected by its laws, it wouldn’t be a problem for Gu Chengfeng to kill Huang Xiaolong with the status he had. As such, he disdained to explain anything to Huang Xiaolong.

However, Gu Chengfeng raised his hands and stopped his guards.

He then looked at Huang Xiaolong and smiled, “I’m merely looking for someone to test my Extermination Whip Art on. The lowly peasants just now were simply too weak and were no threat to me. I’m wondering if you will fare any better than them... Will you be able to receive one move of my Extermination Whip Art?”

As soon as the words left his mouth, his whip shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

Under the infusion of his godforce, the long whip glowed with red light and it stabbed towards Huang Xiaolong’s legs as if it had turned into a long pike.

He was planning to cripple Huang Xiaolong’s legs before taking his time to play this Asura noble before him to death. As for the consequences for doing so, he wasn’t too worried about them. After all, the Gu family was one of the superpowers in the Hell Asura World. Even though he was from a small branch of the Gu family, in the surrounding cities, he was still able to call forth wind and rain whenever he liked.

In the past, he had used this method to deal with many families who had status below his. When their elders had come to him for an explanation, he would simply compensate them with spirit stones and the matter would end there. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flashed coldly as he looked at the incoming whip that was aimed at his legs. Originally, he wanted to avoid attracting trouble after arriving in Hell. It was too bad trouble came knocking at his door.

As the whip was just about to stab into Huang Xiaolong, it stopped in mid air. Gu Chengfeng was startled and his face changed. Before he could make another move, he realized that his entire body was locked in place.

This?!

A trace of panic flashed through his eyes.

As for the guards behind him, they were locked in place as well.

“Do you know what I hate the most?” Huang Xiaolong asked with a frigid expression as he walked towards Gu Chengfeng.

Every step he took, a miserable shriek would pierce through the air as one of the guards behind Gu Chengfeng would explode into a rain of blood.

Gu Chengfeng’s eyes betrayed the terror he felt in his heart. “You, me...” However, he soon realised that his throat seemed to be pinched by an invisible hand as he was unable to make a sound.

Huang Xiaolong walked calmly and unhurriedly towards him.

Eventually, the dozens of guards behind Ge Chengfeng evaporated into a rain of blood and the stench filled the air.

When Huang Xiaolong finally arrived before him, Gu Chengfeng discovered that the godforce in his body had started to go berserk. His eyes widened and his body started to swell. A ‘pop’ could be heard and he turned into a rain of blood as well.

Huang Xiaolong continued walking down the street as though nothing had happened.

The rain of blood in the air finally fell onto the ground after Huang Xiaolong left for quite some time.

In the end, Gu Chengfeng died without even knowing what Huang Xiaolong hated the most.

“Asura Gate.” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

Should I make a visit to the Asura branch?

He had always felt that the Asura Gate in the lower realm was related to the Asura Gate in Hell. In fact, he had a faint feeling that his master, Ren Wokuang, should be present somewhere in the Hell Asura World. It was even possible he was a disciple of the Asura branch sect in the divine plane he was on.

One surprising fact Huang Xiaolong learned was that the Asura Gate wasn’t the strongest force in the Hell Asura World! Instead, it was the Netherworld King’s Organisation!

The Netherworld King’s Organization was extremely mysterious and nobody knew the true master behind it. Even his master, the king of grandmist, and the little cow, had no idea about it!

Did the king of hell come form the Netherworld King’s Organization? After all, one of his titles was the Netherworld King...

Author’s note: Entering Hell, and there’s a change in plot. Today I used quite a bit of brainpower to think about the plot. Was thinking if I should let Huang Xiaolong join the Asura Gate and felt a little conflicted.
