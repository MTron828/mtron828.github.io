Chapter 3669 – Yin Soul Ghost Ship

Jiang Dacheng’s face turned as pale as a sheet when he saw what happened to the expert of the Yin Ghost Race. Even though he didn’t see Huang Xiaolong doing it, he knew that Huang Xiaolong was behind it.

Yue Qing glared at Huang Xiaolong and he growlede, “You’re asking for death!”

As soon as he spoke, he started to walk towards the man.

One of the youngsters beside Yue Qing stopped him suddenly. “Wait!”

Yue Qing was slightly taken aback.

“Get someone to check his background.” The youngster who stopped him whispered.

With his expression fluctuating slightly, Yue Qing eventually nodded and signaled to his subordinates.

The experts who were about to leap at Huang Xiaolong backed down.

“I wonder which family you come from?” The youngster who stopped Yue Qing asked Huang Xiaolong.

Ignoring the youngster, Huang Xiaolong kept his gaze fixed on the other side of the river.

The youngster frowned when he noticed that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t paying attention to him.

“Brother Qi Wei, that human is too arrogant!” Yue Qing gnashed his teeth. “There’s no need to investigate his identity any more! I’ll kill him right now! He’s just a mere human! There’s no need to be afraid of him!”

The youngster called Qi Wei shook his head in response. “There’s no rush. Wait for our fathers to come before dealing with him.”

Yue Qing could only agree reluctantly.

Standing at the riverbank, Huang Xiaolong saw that the Yin Ghost River was almost filled.

In the legends, ghost ships would appear when the river was filled. One could only cross the river if they got on board those ships.

Those who failed to board a ghost ship would never be able to cross the river.

Green Ghost tried it in the past, and he failed to reach the other side.

Those who arrived were waiting quietly for the river to fill up and the ghost ships to arrive. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong turned around and saw Jiang Dacheng standing over there in a daze. A chuckle left his lips, “Why don’t you come over here too?”

Jiang Dacheng gashed his teeth after looking at Yue Qing and the rest. He eventually chose to head over to Huang Xiaolong’s side.

The experts in the surroundings glared at Jiang Dacheng as though they wanted to eat him alive. Despite their hostility, Yue Qing remained silent and none of them moved against Jiang Dacheng.

When Jiang Dacheng arrived behind Huang Xiaolong, he bowed respectfully, “Lord…”

“Follow me up the ship later.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

A joyful expression formed on Jiang Dacheng’s face and he thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely.

There were limited spaces on board a ghost ship. Not anyone could board one! For cultivators like Jiang Dacheng who only comprehended three elements to the grand perfection level, he would never get a chance to board a ghost ship.

Huang Xiaolong was giving him a massive chance!

Jiang Dacheng celebrated in his heart and thought that he should cherish the opportunity given to him.

In the distance, Yue Qing glared at Jiang Dacheng and asked his subordinates, “Which family is that guy from?”

They quickly came back with a reply.

“Oh? Jiang Family of the Nanfeng City?” Yue Qing thought about it for a moment before muttering, “His ancestor should be someone called Jiang Shuping.”

Jiang Shuping paid his respects to Yue Qing during one of the many banquets in the past.

With Jiang Shuping’s cultivation at the peak of the Dao Venerable Realm, he wasn’t qualified to hold Yue Qing’s shoes!

“That’s the one…” His subordinate replied.

A chilly light flashed in Yue Qing’s eyes and he growled, “His ancestor doesn’t even have the ability to pour my tea. How dare a little eminent elder of his family stand against me?”

“Young Master, should we call Jiang Shuping over?”

Yue Qing harrumphed coldly, “Yes. Tell him to get his *ss over here right now. Tell him I wish to meet him. I want him to skin that eminent elder alive.”

The subordinate bowed respectfully before sending the order to Jiang Shuping.

The moment Jiang Shuping received the order, he handed over all his responsibilities and rushed over from the Nanfeng City.

Half an hour later…

The river was almost completely filled.

“Lord, the Yin Ghost River should be completely filled in another half an hour.” Jiang Dacheng whispered into Huang Xiaolong’s ear. He couldn’t help but start to panic when he saw the ever rising surface of water.

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “There’s no need to be anxious. As long as you’re with me, you’ll definitely be able to reach the other side.”

Jiang Dacheng rubbed his head in embarrassment, “I haven’t been there before. I heard that there’s a Sword Grave on the other side.”

“Are you looking for a good sword?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Jiang Dacheng nodded solemnly.”I’m someone who loves the dao of the sword and a good sword is all I ask for!”

“Since that’s the case, I’ll bring you there later.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Jiang Dacheng celebrated in his heart. It was extremely difficult to obtain a sword from the Sword Grave on the other side of the Yin Ghost River. With Huang Xiaolong around, things might become much easier! However, he hesitated slightly after thinking about it. “Will I hold the lord back with my request?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed, “Of course not. Even if it will, you won’t take up too much time.”

“Lord, you said that you were planning to go to the Fengdu City to look for someone. I wonder who it is?” Jiang Dacheng asked all of a sudden. “Fengdu City is extremely dangerous! Moreover, the journey there is long. Lord, it’s dangerous to travel alone.”

A mischievous glint flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Oh. You should know the person I’m looking for.”

“I do?” Jiang Dacheng was taken aback.

“He’s called Zhu Chen.”

Jiang Dacheng’s eyes widened in fright. “Lord Zhu Chen? Are you talking about Lord Zhu Chen, the master of the Zhu Lan Lands?”

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

“Why do you need to look for Lord Zhu Chen?” Jiang Dacheng asked. “Lord, do you wish to beg him for something?”

Huang Xiaolong nearly burst out laughing in response. “Beg him for something? Of course not. I’m going to beat him up until he agrees to be my subordinate.”

Jiang Dacheng stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. He didn’t recover for a long time.

“Lord… You must be kidding…” Jiang Dacheng returned to reality after a long time and he forced a smile.

Huang Xiaolong smiled while remaining silent.

Half an hour later, the Yin Ghost River was completely filled up!

“Look! It’s a Ghost Ship! It appeared!” Many yells came from the crowd.

Everyone turned to look at the river and black ships started to appear. Some of them were large, and some of them were small. Those that were smaller in size could contain three people at most, and the larger ones could contain up to a hundred! The largest ship on the river could contain tens of thousands of experts!

The experts on the riverbank soared into the skies as they flew towards the largest ship.

The larger the ship, the faster it traveled. It allowed the cultivators to reach the other side earlier than the others and gave them more time to look for treasures.

Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to board the ships. He knew that every time the Yin Ghost River started to flood, there would be several Supreme Ghost King Ships. The speed of those ships was much faster than the ordinary ones!

Yue Qing, Qi Wei, and the other young masters were similarly waiting for the Supreme Ghost King Ships to arrive.
