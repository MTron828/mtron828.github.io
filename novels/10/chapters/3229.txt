Chapter 3230: Massacaring Five Celestial Empires’ Experts

“What?!” Huang Shengdao and the others felt the world spinning around them when they felt the aura coming from the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor crumbling.

How could someone with six million units of grand cosmos energy stand up to an expert with eight hundred million units?!

That was like an ant challenging an entire mountain range!

The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor’s expression changed and a terrifying thought flashed through his mind. “Huang Xiaolong did you…?!” Before he could complete his sentence, pillars of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body and filled the entire region around them.

“Run!” The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor screamed and he grabbed the experts of the Extreme Bliss Celestial Empire. The experts of the other four celestial empires were a step too slow, and they were swept up by the explosion that ensued. All of them were sent flying, and there were also some who blew up on the spot.

Miserable cries filled the air.

When Huang Shengdao and Fu Luosen stared at Huang Xiaolong in confusion, the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor yelled, “How are you able to control the World of Departed Souls?!”

Huang Xiaolong definitely used the power of the World of Departed Souls just a second ago.

It was also the reason Huang Xiaolong could withstand his aura. Otherwise, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to do it with the short amount of training he had.

Huang Shengdao and Fu Luosen felt the blood draining from their faces when they heard what the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor said.

“There’s no way! There’s no way he can control the World of Departed Souls!” One of the marshals standing behind Huang Shengdao yelled.

Even an existence at the level of the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor couldn’t refine the World of Departed Souls if they were given several hundred million years. How could Huang Xiaolong, someone who only had six million units of grand cosmos energy, refine the World of Departed Souls?!

That was an absolutely absurd thought!

Huang Xiaolong raised his finger and a giant pillar of light descended from the heavens. A marshal who was on the brink of death was crushed into pieces.

The faces of everyone changed once again.

If Huang Xiaolong hadn’t refined the World of Departed Souls, he wouldn’t have been able to summon the pillar of light!

“How?! How did you refine the World of Departed Souls?!” The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor frowned in shock. As a Celestial Emperor, he knew what controlling an entire world meant.

An unprecedented sense of crisis filled his soul.

“When I exterminate your dao physique, I’ll tell you.” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

The experts of the five celestial empires glared at Huang Xiaolong with equal parts anger and terror.

“Huang Xiaolong, this is a grudge between you and the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire and the True Dragon Celestial Empire! It has nothing to do with us!” The Son of Creation of the Grand Myriad Celestial Empire exclaimed, “We’ll leave right this instant!”

The faces of Huang Shengdao and Fu Luosen turned ugly instantly.

“I gave you a chance to leave, however, all of you refused to take it.” Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned cold. “Now, all of you will have to die!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

There was no way he would allow anyone to learn that he had refined the World of Departed Souls. As such, he would silence everyone who had learned his secret!

“Let’s go!” The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor planned to rip the space around him in order to snake his escape.

“I sealed off the space a hundred million miles around me. Do you think you can escape?” Huang Xiaolong snorted. “Unless you’re a God of Creation, you’ll have to leave your life here today!”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t trying to scare them. With the power he wielded in the World of Departed Souls, only God of Creation Realm experts would be able to stand against him!

“Kill Huang Xiaolong and we will definitely be able to leave! Don’t tell me the experts of our five celestial empires will lose to a mere brat!” Huang Shengdao’s yell tore through the air.

“Lay down the Excessive Darkness Grand Formation!”

“Kill him!”

Fu Luosen raged.

In an instant, the experts of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire started their desperate attempt to kill Huang Xiaolong. Releasing everything they had, they started to lay down the Excessive Darkness Grand Formation.

As the grand formation created by one of the strongest celestial empires, the Excessive Darkness Grand Formation was one of the top ten formations in the universe.

The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor and the others realized that there was no other way and they quickly passed down the order to kill Huang Xiaolong.

In an instant, the experts of all five factions turned their swords against Huang Xiaolong. The heavens trembled and the earth crumbled. Time seemed to flow in reverse.

Golden blood rained down on the lands and the stench of blood filled the air.

When the massacre went down, a group of experts from the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire was coincidentally making their way over.

An expert from the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire stopped all of a sudden.

“Elder Lu, what’s wrong?” Zeng Ying asked.

The elder stared into the distance as he muttered softly, “The space in front of us has been sealed off by a certain expert. We have to make a detour.”

The eldest prince of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, Zeng Tianchong, sneered in response, “Bullsh*t! It’s just a space seal. There’s no need for us to go around it. I’ll shatter the seal right now!”

As soon as he spoke, he raised his arm and smashed the giant hammer in his hands on the seal.

Bang!

A resounding blast rang through the skies as he was sent flying.

Vomiting mouthfuls of golden blood, he stared at the space seal in shock.

“What?!” The experts of the Excessive Heaven Celestial Empire stared at the space seal before looking at Zeng Tianchong. Zeng Tianchong was the strongest prince in the royal family of the Excessive Heaven Celestial Empire, and he comprehended thirteen elements with eleven of them at the perfection level. He was only weaker than Zeng Ying, but even someone at his level was heavily injured by the backlash!

Wiping the blood from his lips, Zeng Tianchong yelled, “All of you, work together to break the barrier right now!”

Elder Lu’s expression changed, but he was too slow to stop them. The experts serving under Zeng Tianchong had already unleashed their attacks on the space seal.

Boom!

Explosions rang through the air as a horrifying wave of energy emerged from inside the space seal.

Everyone who struck the space seal was flung away as the armor on their bodies shattered into tiny little pieces. Blood rained down on the land outside the space seal.

Zeng Tianchong gasped in shock.

“Hurry up and leave!” Elder Lu exclaimed hastily, and he brought Zeng Ying and the others away from the space seal.

They only stopped after they got a pretty distance away from the seal.

“Elder Lu, who in world made the space seal?!” Zeng Ying asked.

Shaking his head slowly, Elder Lu sighed, “I have no idea. However, the person is definitely at the grand perfection level!”

“Grand perfection level?!” The experts of the Excessive Heaven Celestial Empire gasped in shock.

“Could it be Huang Shengdao?!” A complicated look could be seen on Zeng Ying’s face. Ever since Huang Shengdao obtained the Dao Emperor Sword and experienced a huge increase in strength, he was known as the number one cultivator in the younger generation. Everyone would feel a sense of fear when they spoke of his name, including Zeng Ying.

Elder Lu shook his head. “I have no idea.” In fact, he could vaguely feel that the person who sealed off the space was stronger than Huang Shengdao! He was someone who had only entered perfection level in all thirteen elements, and he didn’t know too much about the power wielded by an expert with grand cosmos energy.

When the experts of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire left, there were a ton of experts who ran into the space seal. Like Zeng Tianchong, many of them tried to shatter it, but they were sent packing without the slightest bit of suspense.

Several days passed in an instant.
