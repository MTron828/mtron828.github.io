As they made their way to the tribe, Huang Xiaolong asked Feng Yaozhong, “Brother Yaozhong, have you seen other outsiders whose appearances have resembled us in the past?”

Feng Yaozhong nodded his head, “Yes, I did. Every few years, outsiders will appear and in my several hundreds of thousands of years of existence, I have met a few of them.”

“What happened to them?”

All these outsiders he was referring to had to be experts from the Divine Realm who were sucked into this space by the Ghost River!

As for their mysterious disappearance, it definitely had something to do with the space they were in!

“What happened to them?” Feng Yaozhong thought for a second before replying, “They died.”

Dead!

His words echoed like thunderclaps in the ears of Huang Xiaolong and company.

It was a no brainer... They definitely died from old age due to the devouring force sucking up their vitality.

Thinking up to this point, Huang Xiaolong and the rest felt as though their heart skipped a beat.

“The stronger ones were able to live for several tens of years in this space. As for the weaker ones, they died in about a year...” Feng Yaozhong shook his head and sighed.

“Could it be that there is no exit to this space?” Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of panic rising in his heart.

“Leave?” Feng Yaozhong started to laugh. “If there really was a way to leave, you wouldn’t be able to see me here. Since time immemorial, my ancestors have been trapped here and all of us desire nothing but to leave this place.”

Hearing what the Barbarian said, all of them felt a crushing weight pressing down on their heart.

Is there really no way to leave this space?!

Despite having doubts about being unable to leave, they couldn’t help but think of the Barbarian Ancestors. They had been trapped here for god-knew how long! What if it was true?! What if there was really no way out?!

“There has been a tradition passed down from the forefathers and it states that the person who brings us out of this space will be crowned the King of Barbarians! As long as anyone is able to bring us out, we will follow his order down to the letter!”

A stunned silence fell over Huang Xiaolong’s party.

The King of Barbarians?!

Despite there being an absence of godforce in Feng Yaozhong’s body, Huang Xiaolong could tell that he was a foe to be reckoned with. The power he had in his fleshy body made him comparable to ordinary God King Realm experts. Not just mere low-level God King Realm experts, but he was comparable to a high-level God King!

A single Feng Yaozhong had such power... Huang Xiaolong could only imagine the power of the Barbarians as a whole.

The moment anyone obtained the title of the King of Barbarians, they would be able to command an extraordinarily strong force.

“Who is the current leader of the Barbarians right now?” Jiang Hong asked.

“We are split up into different tribes and most of our tribes consist of several tens of thousands of barbarians. As for the five biggest tribes, they have at the very least, thirty to forty million members. Every single tribe has its own Head Chieftains but the Head Chieftains of the five biggest tribes can be said to be the leader of all the Barbarians.” Feng Yaozhong continued, “I’m from one of the biggest tribes and we are called the Barbaric Wind Tribe.”

“Barbaric Wind Tribe.” Huang Xiaolong repeated the name in his head several times.

“As for the other four tribes, they are called the Barbaric Lightning Tribe, Barbaric Flame Tribe, Barbaric Rain Tribe, and the Barbaric Light Tribe.”

When Huang Xiaolong heard the names, he felt that they weren’t too bad. Well, that was until the names ‘Barbaric Rain Tribe’ and ‘Barbaric Brilliance Tribe’ came out of Feng Yaozhong’s mouth. He couldn’t help but crack a smile.

He had to say, the Barbarians had a unique way of naming their tribes.

Despite laughing at their names, Huang Xiaolong didn’t forget to ask Feng Yaozhong about the strength of the tribes.

Since he didn’t plan on hiding anything, Feng Yaozhong revealed everything they wanted to know. “In your terms, the chiefs of the five biggest tribes are experts in the Emperor Realm.”

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

Five Emperors!

If the entire Barbarian race was to establish itself in the Divine World, they could easily wrestle for a spot in the top hundred Emperor Palaces.

A lightbulb seemed to appear in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

If I manage to look for a way out... Doesn’t that mean?

His heart seemed to pump faster and boiling blood rushed through his veins.

Even though he had Xiang Xun, and the Chaos Black Camel beside him right now, he wouldn’t be able to stand up to any of the Emperor Palaces in the top hundred rankings.

However, if he could subdue the entire Barbarian race, he would instantly add five Emperor Realm experts to his total combat power!

When that happened, he would possess strength rivalling the top hundred Emperor Palaces!

One had to know that the Fortune Emperor Palace only had five Emperors holding the fort. They were Fang Gan, his master Zhao Lei, the old ancestor, Zhou Chen, Chen Yirong, and Li Shan.

“What about the combat power of the five chiefs? Is the chief of your tribe the strongest among them?”

Feng Yaozhong shook his head and said, “The chief of my tribe only has the strength of a late-Third Order Emperor. The strongest chief is the chief of the Barbaric Lightning Tribe, Lei Budong. He should be as strong as a peak early-Fourth Order Emperor. Other than Lei Budong, none of the other chiefs are stronger than him.”

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong gained insight on the situation in the Barbarian Race.

Feng Yaozhong hid nothing from them, and they managed to learn a great deal of information.

There were thirteen smaller chiefs under the five great chiefs and all thirteen of them were peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarchs.

There were hundreds of tribe heads beneath the thirteen chiefs and all of them had the strength of Heavenly Monarchs. However, none of them had extraordinary combat power comparable to exceptional experts at the same level. With Feng Yaozhong’s meticulous explanation, Huang Xiaolong managed to learn the power structure of the Barbarian Race.

After two days of travel, Feng Yaozhong was no longer a stranger to Huang Xiaolong’s party.

“In fact, there is a way for us to leave this place.” Feng Yaozhong suddenly revealed a piece of spicy information that exploded like a bomb in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

After a short period of shock, an ecstatic expression appeared on the faces of everyone present.

“What’s the way?!” Several voices sounded out at the same time.

Even though they guessed that leaving would pose a bit of a challenge, the flames of hope ignited in their heart.

“There is a Land of Lightning Penalty located in the distant north. According to our legends, anyone will be able to leave as long as they pass through the Land of Lightning Penalty.” Feng Yaozhong said but the more he spoke, the more demoralized he became. “However, the moment you step foot into the Land of Lightning Penalty, you will be bombarded by endless Chaos Divine Lightning. Even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert wouldn’t be able to cross the Land of Lightning Penalty! If you plan on crossing it, it will be very, very, very difficult!”

Feng Yaozhong shook his head and emphasised the word ‘difficult’. He even added three ‘very’ in front of it to describe the level of difficulty they would face.

“What if an expert surpassing the Emperor Realm tries to cross the Land of Lightning Penalty?” Huang Xiaolong hastily inquired.

Jiang Hong was an expert who had surpassed the Emperor Realm!

Everyone turned to look at Feng Yaozhong simultaneously.

“Someone who surpassed the Emperor Realm?” Feng Yaozhong was stunned. He frowned and said, “I’m not too sure how far he will be able to go. After all, no one has ever explored the Land of Lightning Punishment and the strongest ancestors were all at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. They were only able to enter three thousand feet into the Land of Lightning Penalty.”

A look of disappointment flashed past their faces.

Even though Feng Yaozhong didn’t state it outright, they knew that even an existence surpassing the Emperor Realm would face difficulty when trying to cross the Land of Lightning Penalty.

“How far is the Land of Lightning Penalty from here?”

“It’s extremely far!” Feng Yaozhong shook his head. “Even if I flew there at top speed, I would take seven to eight years!”

Seven to eight years!

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
