Huang Xiaolong already expected this reaction from the three, but he was still embarrassed being stared at with such intense gazes. He nodded at Feng Yang, saying, “This disciple has been very fortunate, coming across some fortuitous encounters these years, and accidentally broke through to late-Tenth Order God Realm.”

Feng Yang, Liu Yun, and Qi Wen nearly tumbled while standing after they heard Huang Xiaolong’s excuse.

Again, accidentally?!

One could break through to Tenth Order God Realm accidentally?!

The three of them stared at Huang Xiaolong with exaggerated astonishment.

However, anyone who found out that Huang Xiaolong was already a late-Tenth Order God Realm would have such an expression. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

How long had he been cultivating?

Not even a hundred and fifty years, right?

A hundred and fifty years! For some God Realm cultivators, a hundred and fifty years was nothing but the blink of an eye. Some super forces’ geniuses would take several hundred years just to break through from peak half-step God Realm to God Realm.

A long time later, Feng Yang, Liu Yun, and Qi Wen recovered from their astonishment. Their complicated emotions only grew more complicated.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong, Feng Yang suddenly had an impulse to laugh loudly and to cry loudly at the same time.

Huang Xiaolong was his personal disciple, and his disciple having such amazing achievements made him feel over the moon. Then again, he had always been proud of his own great talent, but when compared to this personal disciple of his, the gap was too shocking for Feng Yang.

He remembered that it took him exactly five hundred years to reach Tenth Order God Realm from First Order God Realm.

No, more accurately, it took him five hundred and three years.

While Feng Yang was downcast, Liu Yun and Qi Wen were just as despondent.

Liu Yun recalled that moment a little over a hundred years ago, when Huang Xiaolong had just passed the Black Warrior Institute’s new disciple assessment, successfully becoming an outer disciple, then their Master took an interest and received Huang Xiaolong as his personal disciple. These scenes flashed past in Liu Yun’s mind.

The lively and grand apprenticeship ceremony felt like yesterday, and yet, their youngest Junior Apprentice-brother was already a Tenth Order God Realm cultivator?! Furthermore, judging from the aura he released, Huang Xiaolong’s real strength definitely exceeds his!

Liu Yin was depressed. He embarked on the path of cultivation for more than ten thousand years, and how long had Huang Xiaolong been cultivating?

No one spoke.

Everyone in the hall was dead silent.

“Master, you told me to return, saying there’s something you want to say to me. May I know what is it?” At the end, it fell on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders to break the heavy silence.

Feng Yang regained his composure, a smile spread over his face, “It’s nothing big. The reason I wanted you to return is to have you accompany me to participate in Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday celebration. I was a little worried initially, but since you’ve already broken through to Tenth Order God Realm, it seems I worried needlessly.”

‘As expected, it was related to the Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday banquet.’ Huang Xiaolong inwardly confirmed. But what was Feng Yang worrying about? This point perplexed Huang Xiaolong.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Feng Yang explained, “Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday celebration banquet this time is only an excuse on the surface. From the information I received, Saint Mother Yao Chi has decided to ascend to the Divine World some time in the near future, that’s why before she ascends she wants to select a disciple to inherit her legacy.”

Liu Yun and Qi Wen straightened their backs and listened attentively. Only now did they realize there was another intention behind Saint Mother Yao Chi’s banquet.

Feng Yang went on, “Although we don’t know what criteria Saint Mother Yao Chi is basing on to select her inheritor, I think there will be some kind of competition or talent assessment to determine the person.”

Liu Yun inquired, “Master is saying that, in Saint Mother Yao Chi’s banquet, all families’ talented disciples present there would compete against each other and the strongest one or the most talented person will inherit her legacy?”

Feng Yang nodded, “This is the most possible scenario, but it still depends on her final decision.” Saying this, Feng Yang turned to Huang Xiaolong, seeing his nonchalant expression, a wry smile tugged at the corners of his mouth, “I know you kid have no interest in becoming Saint Mother Yao Chi’s inheritor, but being selected is not so simple as learning as new cultivation technique.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up, “Master’s saying?”

Feng Yang continued, “Saint Mother Yao Chi was the first place winner of the God Ranking Battle in the second last term, not many people know about her before that. Later on, the reason her strength improved so drastically is because she found a great ancient sect’s treasury! Inside that great ancient sect’s treasury is a kind of medicinal pellet that’s even higher grade than the Exalted Divinity Pellet!”

“Even higher grade than the Exalted Divinity Pellet?!” Huang Xiaolong was genuinely shocked.

Liu Yun and Qi Wen were also shocked.

Wasn’t the Exalted Divinity Pellet ranked at the top amongst sacred grade divine pellets in the four galaxies? There was actually something of even higher grade?

Feng Yang nodded, “Correct. Though the Exalted Divinity Pellet sits at the top of the sacred grade divine pellet list, it’s not exactly accurate. As far as I know, there are two kinds of sacred grade divine pellets that are of a higher grade compared to the Exalted Divinity Pellets.”

Two kinds!

Huang Xiaolong, Liu Yun, and Qi Wen all showed astonished faces.

“One of the two is what the Saint Mother Yao Chi found from that great ancient sect’s treasury, called Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pill, and the other one is the ancient times’ Wilderness Deity Everlasting Hundred Connecting Divine Pill!” said Feng Yang.

A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pill!

Although with his current strength he didn’t necessarily need this Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pill, there were still his family and those at Huang Clan Manor. This Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pill would definitely be beneficial for his family’s cultivation.

“Master, even if Saint Mother found the Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pill, so many years have passed. With her own consumption, wouldn’t they be finished by now?” Liu Yun asked.

Feng Yang smiled “Finished? What if she has the refining method for the Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pill?”

“The refining method?!” Liu Yun blurted in surprise.

Feng Yang confirmed, “Right, Saint Mother Yao Chi not only has the Amethyst Water Droplet Divine Pill, but she also has its refining method. On top of that, she has an armor named Light of the Water God’s Divine Armor, and other divine artifacts. When she ascends to the Divine World, she won’t be able to take the Light of the Water God’s Divine Armor, thus, all these things will be passed over to the disciple she selects. Even more so that treasury she found. Moreover, after being a great Highgod Realm master for so many years herself, her personal collection of treasures is also very valuable!”

“Does that mean we’re unable to bring other things when ascending to the Divine World?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned as he asked the question.

Feng Yang nodded, “That’s right, the natural laws of the higher realms differ from ours, therefore things from our lower realms are unable to enter the Divine World, including spatial rings. Unless they are things from a higher realm from the beginning.”

Huang Xiaolong inwardly breathed in relief hearing the last part.

‘That’s good.’

The Godly Mt. Xumi was a treasure from the Buddhist World, and the Dragon Pearl was the Divine World Dragon God’s treasure. According to this, he’d be able to bring these two items to the Divine World.

“Master, about Saint Mother Yao Chi’s disciple selection, can anyone participate?” Qi Wen asked.

Feng Yang smiled, “Naturally not, only those below the Highgod Realm. A Highgod Realm master could ascend to the Divine World at any time, so the inheritor that Saint Mother Yao Chi chooses cannot be a Highgod Realm master. All of you get ready, three days later we’ll set out to the Great Lake World.”

Feng Yang’s three disciples nodded.

Since they would be departing three days later, Huang Xiaolong decided to return to his Golden Dragon Peak and look around.
