“Who dares to cause trouble in our Lin Family Fort?! You must not want to live anymore!”

A few seconds after Huang Xiaolong broke the steel gates with a punch, a loud outraged voice thundered from the inner part of the Lin Family Fort as a figure whistled through the air toward him.

Subsequently, various heavy footsteps sounded. A second later, the fort guards arrived in waves.

Watching the figure flying towards him, Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed. From Lin Chaoqun’s memories, he knew that the current Lin Family Fort only had one Elder guarding the whole fort, which was precisely the figure who was now flying towards him, Lin Hang.

This Lin Hang was only a late-First Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator.

To the current Huang Xiaolong, he barely needed to lift a finger to deal with such a ‘master’.

Lin Hang descended where the Lin Family Fort steel gates used to be, looking at the broken gates not far away and the dented punch imprint on them, his face extremely grim.

Their Lin Family Fort steel gates had been strengthened with additional defensive formations, sufficient to block the full powered attack of an average early First Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator, yet this black-haired young man broke them with just a punch. He had to be a mid-First Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator at the very least!

Lin Hang turned his attention back at Huang Xiaolong, “This young hero, may I know your purpose coming to our Lin Family Fort?” Had this been in the past, he would have attack Huang Xiaolong without another word, however, under the current circumstances, he had no other choice but be polite.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over Lin Hang and the layers of Lin Family Fort guards, saying, “I already killed Lin Chaoqun. If you all submit to me, I will consider sparing your lives.”

“What?! Lord Fort Lin is dead?!”

“Impossible, this punk must be lying! Just some days ago Fort Lord Lin sent back a message informing us that young fort lord has successfully entered the Barbarian God Sect, already an outer sect disciple!”

The present Lin Family Fort disciples were enraged, shouting insults and words of denial, refusing to believe that Lin Chaoqun was dead.

All of a sudden, Lin Hang punched out at Huang Xiaolong, arriving before him in the blink of an eye. The punch brimming with killing intent landed squarely on Huang Xiaolong’s body.

“This punk can’t even dodge Elder Lin Hang’s attack, he has some guts to claim he killed our Fort Lord Lin. Didn’t I already say he’s lying through his teeth, a bunch of crap!”

“He actually dares to run to our Lin Family Fort’s doorstep and cause trouble, I say he’s tired of living!”

When the crowd of disciples saw Elder Lin Hang’s fist landing unimpeded on the intruder’s body, all of them broke out in smiles.

However, their laughter barely sounded when it was stuck in their throats. The black-haired young man who took on Elder Lin Hang’s punch did not budge an inch, sitting firmly atop his cow mount as if the previous attack was nothing but a passing summer breeze.

Lin Hang also had an astonished expression on his face, staring at Huang Xiaolong, ‘This...!’

He was a late-First Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator, even an early Second Order Heavenly God wouldn’t be able to remain immovable like Huang Xiaolong after taking his punch!

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong pointed a finger at Lin Hang. A sharp finger force pierced across the air, and in the next second Lin Hang grunted, his body was knocked back limply, crashing onto the Lin Family Fort walls. Blood was spurting madly from his mouth.

Watching this, the surrounding disciples became ashen, retreating back with apprehension. No one dared to make a sound, nor did they dare to check Lin Hang’s condition.

“You, come here.” Huang Xiaolong simply pointed at a peak late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm guard captain.

When that guard captain saw the black-haired young man pointing at him, he turned deathly pale, incessantly shaking his head as he retreated further back. He then turned around, wanting to run.

Watching this, Huang Xiaolong pointed his finger at the guard captain across space, causing him to fall to the ground from midair, no longer breathing.

This swiftness greatly intensified the surrounding Lin Family Fort disciples’ fear and panic. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You two, come over.” Huang Xiaolong then chose another two guard captains.

Both guard captains’ legs nearly gave out. Their bodies trembled visibly, but with the first guard captain ending up as an example, neither of them dared to run. The two guard captains cautiously inched toward Huang Xiaolong.

“W-what, what instructions does Senior have?” Arriving in front of Huang Xiaolong, the two guard captains stammered.

“I’ve already said. If you all submit to me, I can spare your lives.” Huang Xiaolong repeated indifferently.

The two guard captains exchanged a look, hesitation flickering in their eyes. After several minutes of internal struggle, the two guard captains finally knelt down, submitting to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction, then his gaze fell on other Lin Family Fort guards and disciples.

At the receiving end of Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, the guards and disciples fell to their knees one after another. In just a short while, a large stretch of Lin Family Fort guards and disciples showed their fealty.

Huang Xiaolong’s overwhelming strength had extinguished all thoughts of resistance they had before, not to mention the fact that their Fort Lord was already gone, submitting to Huang Xiaolong now wouldn’t be considered a betrayal.

In the end, even Lin Hang knelt down.

Following this, Huang Xiaolong left his soul mark on Lin Hang’s godhead.

As for the guard captains and disciples, he couldn’t be bothered to spend so much effort to control them.

Deterred by his previous display of strength and adding on Lin Hang’s support, these Lin Family Fort guard captains and disciples wouldn’t think of betraying him. Then again, even if they did choose to betray, Huang Xiaolong didn’t really mind. What he wanted from the Lin Family Fort were the Zhenyu Sect treasure map and the Lin Family Fort’s treasury.

As the entire Lin Family Fort had submitted to him, Huang Xiaolong suddenly turned around. His hand grabbed through space, catching a He Family disciple who was sent to tail Huang Xiaolong.

The He Family disciple was still in shock after witnessing Huang Xiaolong conquering the Lin Family Fort, and before he knew it, he was flying uncontrollably toward Huang Xiaolong. Realizing he had been found out, there was a terrified expression on his face, but before he could even plead for mercy, Huang Xiaolong was already scouring through his memories.

A few minutes later, the soul-scouring ended and Huang Xiaolong threw the He Family disciple to Lin Hang. As for how to handle him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to say it.

From the He Family disciple’s memories, Huang Xiaolong found out he was sent by the He Family Patriarch to follow him. The group of core disciples he taught a lesson earlier was part of the Green Sun City four main forces, the He, Su, Zhuang, and Deng Families.

However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t bothered by this incident.

The strongest amongst the four families’ Patriarchs was He Hanyu, who was merely a mid-Second Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator.

After giving some healing pellets to Lin Hang, Huang Xiaolong had the Lin Family Fort disciples clean up the surrounding area and reassemble the steel gates while he headed to the main fort building riding on the little cow.

The Lin Family Fort encompassed a large area of land, with over a hundred courtyards all around. There were front and back courtyards, gardens, a main hall, even training fields.

Huang Xiaolong went straight to the building with the secret chamber where Lin Chaoqun hid the Zhenyu Sect treasure map. It didn’t take long to open the stone door, then finding the treasure map.

Other than the map, there was also a key in the shape of a broken sword, which opened the Zhenyu Sect’s treasury. Huang Xiaolong studied the map in his hands for some time before putting it away, heading out toward the Lin Family Fort treasury.

At this time, inside the He Family’s great hall, He Hanyu received news that Huang Xiaolong entered the Lin Family Fort.

“He really entered the Lin Family Fort, is that kid some distant relative of Lin Chaoqun?” A light glimmered in He Hanyu’s eyes.

“I’m afraid that should be the case. The disciple we sent to follow that punk did not send any news back, it seems he was discovered. Therefore, this subordinate is only guessing.” A He Family Elder answered.

He Hanyu sneered, “Whether he is or not is not important. Are the Sun and other families ready?”

“They are ready, we can attack the Lin Family Fort anytime.”
