Chapter 258: Battling Chen Xiaotian

[/expand]

“Who are you?!” The question flew from Chen Xiaotian’s mouth as he studied Huang Xiaolong warily. His gut instinct told him that Huang Xiaolong didn’t belong to the Blood Swallow School or Nine Fiend Sect.

Huang Xiaolong faced Chen Xiaotian, indifferently saying, “Who I am is not important,” after a slight pause, Huang Xiaolong continued, “I think you would best understand that there is no escape for you today. You have two options in front of you; submission, or death.”

Huang Xiaolong wasted no time with nonsense, laying down two choices on the table for Chen Xiaotian in a straightforward manner.

Chen Xiaotian chanced another furtive glance in Geng Ken, Du Xin, and Deng Guangliang’s direction as they stood behind Huang Xiaolong. Suddenly, a cold, desolate feeling of despair rose from his heart. Was this how it felt being betrayed and abandoned?

“Did you plan on letting them attack me together, or one by one?” Pushing down the feelings of despair, Chen Xiaotian asked Huang Xiaolong in a stiff, cold voice.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, waving a hand at Geng Ken, Du Xin, Deng Guangliang, and the other Sky Magi Sect Elders back, “All of you step back. No one is allowed to make a move without my order.”

When these words were spoken, all present were stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s decision.

“Young Lord, this...!” Geng Ken took a step forward, wanting to dissuade Huang Xiaolong.

No one here knew Chen Xiaotian’s true strength better than him. Although he had to admit that Huang Xiaolong was strong, Chen Xiaotian was a late-Xiantian Seventh Order after all. Moreover, if his estimation was correct, Chen Xiaotian’s real strength was higher than that.

“Step down!” Huang Xiaolong snapped.

Geng Ken trembled, swiftly saluted respectfully and retreated to the back line where Du Xin, Deng Guangliang, and the rest were standing.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Chen Xiaotian, “If you can defeat me, you can leave.”

Chen Xiaotian glanced at the line up of Sky Magi Sect Elders at the back and then back to Huang Xiaolong, “For real?” Looking skeptical on the surface but his heart was delighted at Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance. He wasn’t sure of Huang Xiaolong’s actual strength, but judging from Huang Xiaolong’s aura, Chen Xiaotian was sure Huang Xiaolong hadn’t broken through to Xiantian Seventh Order.

“Correct.” Huang Xiaolong affirmed coolly, catching the flicker of joy in Chen Xiaotian’s eyes; it seems this Chen Xiaotian thinks he will win over me?

The instant Huang Xiaolong’s reply came, one azure and one red light flew out from Chen Xiaotian’s body, merging into a tree above his head.

A giant tree materialized, shrouded in an azure colored gale and dark red flames.

First-rank grade eleven martial spiritーWindfire Tree!

The power of the wind and fire elements instantly filled the grand hall.

Chen Xiaotian wasted no time in merging with his Windifre Tree martial spirit immediately after summoning it. After soul transforming, both of Chen Xiaotian’s arms were crackling and burning with dark red flames; at the same time, azure colored wind swished up and down and around his body.

The soul transformed Chen Xiaotian seized the initiative, launching an attack on Huang Xiaolong. He dashed forward in a blur of azure light with streaks of dark red, at amazing speed, as if he was the embodiment of wind. Not only were Du Xin and Deng Guangliang unable to capture Chen Xiaotian’s movements, even the strongest amongst them, Geng Ken, a peak late-Sixth Order Xiantian could only see vague afterimages. This filled everyone with apprehension.

“Careful, Young Lord!” Geng Ken and the others couldn’t help exclaiming out loud.

Huang Xiaolong branded a soul mark in each of their souls. Being connected at soul level, if Huang Xiaolong died, they too would follow, their souls facing destruction.

Watching Chen Xiaotian coming at him, Huang Xiaolong released his Asura Physique. Black, ebony Wings of Demon spread, and displaying Phantom Shadow at the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared, leaving only a faint shadow in the air.

Chen Xiaotian’s fist struck, piercing through the shadow left behind in Huang Xiaolong’s place, the afterimage shadow puffed away like wisps of smoke.

His attack fell on empty air, Chen Xiaotian spun around with a horrified expression, looking at Huang Xiaolongㅡthis black-haired young man actually dodged his attack! His actual strength was not what the outside rumours claimed to be, he had long ago advanced into the peak of late-Xiantian Seventh Order, and with the power of the wind element added onto his body after soul transformation, his speed greatly surpassed warriors of the same strength. Despite all of this, Huang Xiaolong managed to dodge his attack.

Having avoided Chen Xiaotian’s attack, Huang Xiaolong rounded back with the Blades of Asura in his hands, slashing out at Chen Xiaotian from midair.

The Asura Sword Skill’s Fourth Move: State of Abundant Lightning!

A lightning storm descended on the grand hall, countless lightning flood dragons formed as they hit the floor, roaring at the targeted Chen Xiaotian. In the short blink of an eye, Chen Xiaotian was surrounded.

Chen Xiaotian’s face became ashen at the abrupt grave situation he found himself in.

With a bellow, Chen Xiaotian twirled his body around like a flaming cloud and floated to the air, barely escaping the attacks of several lightning flood dragons. But he didn’t expect that the flood dragon-shaped lightning could turn into rotating gales, dogging his steps.

After so many years, Huang Xiaolong had perfected the combination of Asura Sword Skill’s first move, Tempest of Hell and the second move, Tears of Asura, into the fourth move, State of Abundant Lightning. When attacking, the lightning streaks were unpredictable, turning into an angry thunderstorm in the next moment. It evolved into quite a powerful move.

Chen Xiaotian ‘floated’ from one side to the other, endlessly ‘flowing’ with the air current, dodging the attacks of the lightning flood dragons repeatedly. Time elapsed and the State of Abundant Lightning dissipated.

After he was hit directly by the lightning, Chen Xiaotian appeared awkward and miserable, parts of his robes were singed and tattered, with burnt black holes.

“Windfist Flowing Fire Palm!”

When Huang Xiaolong’s attack dissipated, Chen Xiaotian vented his wrath. Chen Xiaotian struck with his left fist and a hurricane of wind formed in front of it, whereas his right hand struck a palm that pierced through space, dancing with dark red flames.

A punch and a palm fused into one attack, violently influencing the airflow of the grand hall, so much that Geng Ken and the group of Elder standing at the edge felt like they were being melted in a heated furnace, yet at the same time, blades of wind cut against their skin.

Even for Huang Xiaolong, it was the first time he came across such a battle skill.

After a brief moment of surprise, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned sharp and cold, swinging the blades in his hands. Countless blade lights spun in peculiar circular motions, as a deep hued red eyeball materialized out of nowhere, it too spinning in the same direction. Icy blade lights flew out from the red eyeball, crashing into the enemy’s wind fist and fire palm.

High above in the grand hall space, a chain of blasts rang out. Aftershocks of wind and fire rolled out as remnants of blade lights ricocheted in all directions, leaving spine-chilling cut marks on the walls of the grand hall.

When the deep red eyeball appeared, Chen Xiaotian felt dizzied from shock at the scene before him. Unable to control himself, his body wobbled as he looked at Huang Xiaolong with shock and trepidation.

What kind of battle skill was this?!

By now, it was apparent to him that Huang Xiaolong had yet to break through to Xiantian Seventh Order, but the cultivation technique he practiced was undoubtedly high. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong’s battle qi grade exceeded his by more than a grade or two. On top of that, the battle skill he practiced was much stronger too, perhaps it might even be a legendary Heaven grade battle skill!

Seeing that even the Eye of Reincarnation failed to resolve Chen Xiaotian, Huang Xiaolong realized it would difficult to defeat the opponent if he didn’t summon his martial spirit.

At the end of the day, Chen Xiaotian’s strength was a peak late-Xiantian Seventh Order.

With Chen Xiaotian, Geng Ken, and the rest watching, a coruscating light burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Roars of dragons shook the heavens as twin dragons materialized in midairㅡa black and a blue dragon! Overwhelming dragon might flooded the hall like the rushing currents of the Milky Way, spreading to every corner of the spacious grand hall.

The black and blue dragons wound themselves around Huang Xiaolong, akin to a Dragon God reincarnation.

“Twin Primordial Divine Dragon martial spirits!”

Geng Ken, Du Xin, and Deng Guangliang’s bodies trembled, staring at Huang Xiaolong with feverish eyes.
