The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of the Devil Tower, the boisterous atmosphere at the square came to an abrupt silence. All eyes locked on Huang Xiaolong’s figure in high-air.

“He’s out!”

All the Devil Races’ experts, including Heavenly Punishment Archdevil, Stone Ape Archdevil, and Violent Lightning Archdevil, had their gazes fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

Since the Heavenless Archdevil Lord had reached the top of the Devil Floor’s ninth floor, no one had succeeded after him. But now, such a person had appeared!

This black-haired young man related to the Six Nether Gate was the first person to succeed in reaching the top of the Devil Tower’s ninth floor in ten billion years! What shocked them the most was that this young man had done it in less than three months!

The Heavenless Archdevil Lord had taken more than a year to reach the top of the ninth floor.

The talent gap was unimaginable and could not be described with mere words when comparing less than three months to more than a year’s time.

A freak genius who was many times more talented than Heavenless Archdevil Lord—what kind of concept is that?! No one could imagine, and the only word they could think of was terrifying, but it was still inadequate to describe their real thoughts.

Even Heavenly Punishment Archdevil, Stone Ape Archdevil, and Violent Lightning Archdevil, who had once followed by Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s side, conquering and slaughtering through millions of planes, felt overwhelmingly apprehensive.

When someone comes across such an outstandingly talented person, it gives them a feeling of facing an expert whose strength has reached unimaginable heights. And that feeling is fear.

Stone Ape Archdevil and Violent Lightning Archdevil had similar feelings, even more so the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestor. Even in his fear, the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors never lifted their eyes from Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the surging murderous aura from the Hundred Transformation Sect and walked towards Gao Changran and his group.

At the same time, Gao Changran and his group flew forward to meet Huang Xiaolong. Stopping in front of Huang Xiaolong, both Gao Changran and Wang Fanning’s faces were beaming with joy as they saluted and congratulated, “Congratulations to Lord for successfully reaching the top of the Devil Tower.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded his head at them. He then had everyone stand up and said, “Go back first.”

Although he had managed to reach the top of the Devil Tower’s ninth floor and gained many benefits along with successfully breaking through to Ninth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, he still needed to stabilize his cultivation foundation.

Gao Changran and Wang Fanning respectfully complied.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong was about to leave, Violent Lightning Archdevil finally reacted. Killing intent soared in his eyes, but just as he was about to make his move, Stone Ape Archdevil reached out and stopped him. Stone Ape Archdevil shook his head at Violent Lightning Archdevil.

Violent Lightning Archdevil was taken aback by Stone Ape Archdevil’s action. He frowned and hesitated, and in the end, he heeded Stone Ape Archdevil’s advice. He was fuming as he watched Huang Xiaolong leave.

When the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors saw Violent Lightning Archdevil had failed to take any action against Huang Xiaolong, they reluctantly gave up on their plan. In the end, there was nothing they could do but glare at Huang Xiaolong as he went away.

After Huang Xiaolong had knocked off Chen Weijian with a single punch on the Devil Tower’s second floor, he had suffered a grave injury to attempt reclimbing the Devil Tower. Thus, Chen Weijian had left the tower.

Currently, Chen Weijian was still recovering from his injuries inside the Hundred Transformation Sect branch’s secret chamber in the Eternal Devil Lands. Even though Chen Weijian’s injuries could be healed, it had left a big sequelae that might affect Chen Weijian’s future breakthrough to Sovereign Realm.

Originally, based on Chen Weijian’s potential, he had a high chance of surpassing the Emperor Realm to become a lord Sovereign. But now, he could only forget it.

This was Huang Xiaolong’s fault!

The Hundred Transformation Sect’s Old Ancestor had stormed out of his seclusion in a fury after learning this, and he had rushed to the Eternal Devil Lands from the Hundred Transformation Sect headquarters.

On top of that, he had issued an order to kill Huang Xiaolong, no matter the consequences!

In the end, Huang Xiaolong, the four odd beasts, Gao Changran, and the rest had disappeared on the horizon in front of various experts’ complicated expressions.

Heavenly Punishment Archdevil said to the Heavenly Punishment Sect’s Ancestors, “It’s time to go.”

Go?

Heavenly Punishment Sect’s Ancestor Li Yu hesitated, “Lord Archdevil, aren’t we going to wait until Miss comes out?”

At this time, Xing Yinuo was still on the Devil Tower’s fifth floor.

“Not waiting anymore. The result is the same, anyway.” Heavenly Punishment Archdevil sighed and shook his head.

When coming here, his original intention was never to see his baby daughter’s result, but to verify something personally, and he had already confirmed that matter.

Moreover, Xing Yingnuo couldn’t reach the top Devil Tower’s ninth floor. Hence, it was meaningless to stay here and waste time.

Heavenly Punishment Archdevil left without bidding farewell to Violent Lightning Archdevil or Stone Ape Archdevil. He merely left two Heavenly Punishment Sect’s Ancestors to wait for Xing Yinuo.

A while later, Stone Ape Archdevil also led the Devil Ape Cult’s group and left without another word.

After leaving the square, Huang Xiaolong headed directly back to the residence. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

On the way, Gao Changran updated Huang Xiaolong about Chen Weijian’s condition.

When Huang Xiaolong heard the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Old Ancestor had issued a kill order for his head, and he was currently rushing to the Eternal Devil Land from the Hundred Transformation Sect’s headquarters, Huang Xiaolong merely smiled in response.

“Oh right, Your Majesty, we’ve found out the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming, Massacring God Gate’s Old Ancestor Chu Han, as well as the Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu are all at the Eternal Devil Land’s Secret Yuan Mansion.” Gao Changran remembered another matter and reported to Huang Xiaolong.

“Oh,” Huang Xiaolong’s footsteps halted in surprise. He was surprised that Gao Changran had found Shi Ming and the others’ whereabouts.

Gao Changran explained, “Someone must have discovered them and deliberately leaked the news. Probably, nine out of ten of the forces know about it by now.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered as he pondered. A moment later, he said, “Since many people know, Shi Ming, Chu Han, and Feng Chu most likely have already realized their whereabouts are exposed. Did they not run or hide?”

Gao Changran shook his head, “No, they are still at the Secret Yuan Mansion.”

“What is the reaction of other devil forces?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Perhaps it is because of Shi Ming’s notorious reputation that no one dared to make a move on them,” Gao Changran replied.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

“...Your Majesty, do you want us to?” Gao Changran inquired.

“Not necessary.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. He understood what Gao Changran meant to say.

Back at the residence, Huang Xiaolong had Gao Changran continue to pay attention to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming, Stone Ape Archdevil, and others’ movements before stepping into the chamber. Inside, he took out and consumed the Devil Holy Water and Heaven Suppressing Hundred Evil Pills and entered cultivation.

After reaching the top of Devil Tower’s ninth floor, Huang Xiaolong felt different when consuming the Devil Holy Water.

Due to his Ascending Devil Physique, consuming the Devil Holy Water was ten times more beneficial to him than before.

A month later, after refining a drop of Devil Holy Water, Huang Xiaolong’s body and the soul felt comfortable all over.

While Huang Xiaolong was in quiet seclusion, the whole Eternal Devil City was boiling. At every corner and alley was gossip about Huang Xiaolong reaching the Devil Tower’s top in a short three months.

Within the Eternal Devil City’s Secret Yuan Mansion, Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu’s finger caressed the cup in his hand. There was icy killing intent roiling in his eyes as he spoke in a voice filled with hatred, “The one that reached the top of the Devil Tower’s ninth floor must be him, Huang Xiaolong, that runt! In the whole universe, only a freak like Huang Xiaolong has such monstrous talent! It cannot be anyone else! The four odd beasts with him might be able to trick other people, but not me!”

Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor, Chu Han looked at the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Shi Ming, then said, “I too think it is Huang Xiaolong, that runt!”
