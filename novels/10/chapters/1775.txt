Not far away, Gudu Wuyi was filled with indescribable anguish as he gazed at the fortieth place on the rankings board. His voice spoke of fury, despair, unwillingness, and denial as he sobbed, “My son Canyang!”

The most intense emotion of all was his hatred and pain towards the heavens and everything in it.

Similarly, the other Solitude Emperor Palace’s Ancestors eyes were a little dim with grief, and anguish was etched on their faces.

The pillar of their hope, the Solitude Emperor Palace’s most talented genius, the Solitude Emperor’s Disciple... was dead!

Dead! Gudu Nanying’s mind went completely blank.

They had been fantasizing that Gudu Canyang would perform outstandingly in this time’s Battle of the Heavenly Court, entering the top thirty ranks! He was on the path to bringing glory and honor to their Solitude Emperor Palace, but now, their hopes were shattered.

They hadn’t even entered the second day of the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

Like Gudu Wuyi and the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Chen Huoan, the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Chen Wenxin was staring at the forty-sixth place on the rankings board with a dark and sullen expression.

His personal disciple, Sun Fei’s name, had just disappeared from that spot a second ago.

Sun Fei was his sole personal disciple, and he looked favorably on him. Although Sun Fei’s talent couldn’t compare to the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple Lan Tailong, Sun Fei’s talent and potential definitely ranked in the top three among the Brightness Emperor Palace’s younger generation of disciples!

Moreover, Sun Fei’s strength was in the top five among the Brightness Emperor Palace’s participating disciples. Sun Fei had a high chance of advancing into the top fifty in this Battle of the Heavenly Court, but now, he was dead!

Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Chen Wenqian comforted him, “Rest assured. We will investigate Fei’er death. If Fei’er’s death is unrelated to any Heavenly Demons or devils, I won’t let his death be meaningless.”

“Elder Brother, you mean...?!” Chen Wenxin trembled, and his eyes widened as if he had thought of something.

Chen Wenqian was his elder brother of the same blood.

Both of them were high-level Emperor Realm experts, which was rare in the Divine World.

Chen Wenqian’s eyes glimmered as he added, “Sun Fei and the Solitude Emperor Palace’s Gudu Canyang, Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Chen Zhuang, and the Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace’s disciple Jiang De died around the same time. I feel this is not a coincidence.”

Chen Wenxin blanked for a moment. In the next second, a ruthless light flickered across his eyes as he said, “If it’s someone who dares to provoke our Brightness Emperor Palace by killing our disciples, then this person is courting death. I will make sure this person regrets living in this world!”

Chen Wenqian agreed, “If it is as per my assumption, very few people have the strength to kill all of them at once.”

Four days passed in the blink of an eye. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A total of five days had passed since the start of the preliminary round.

During this time, as the gap between points widened further, the changes on the rankings board were much less frequent and had become more stable. This was especially true for the top one hundred names, where there were almost no changes.

The most frequent changes happened between the first and second place.

Huang Xiaolong and the Heavenly Prince Di Jing were still battling for first place.

Even with the support of the Radiance Divine Scepter and his Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t yet suppressed Di Jing completely.

But this did not disappoint Huang Xiaolong. Instead, he became more excited and interested.

In the beginning, Huang Xiaolong had merely employed half of his Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead’s godforce. As time passed, he had gradually increased the percentage of godforce to sixty, then seventy, eighty, and now, it had already reached ninety percent!

Merely relying on the Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead’s godforce was insufficient to gain a significant lead over Di Jing’s points. Thus Huang Xiaolong began employing a hundred percent of the Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead’s godforce power.

Another two days went by.

Huang Xiaolong and Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s points were still battling intensely.

The two took turns occupying the first and second place.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong sneered. In that case, he was curious to see where Di Jing’s limit was.

Without delay, Huang Xiaolong circulated his Holy Dragon Supreme Godhead’s godforce in combination with his Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead’s godforce to the max.

Two godheads’ godforce superimposed drastically, increasing Huang Xiaolong’s hunting speed.

The gap between Huang Xiaolong and Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s points widened visibly at a shocking speed.

In a mere one hour, Huang Xiaolong had pulled ahead by more than 10,000 points.

However, an hour later, the Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s points exploded upward and narrowed the distance. However, just as Di Jing’s points were about to catch up to Huang Xiaolong, they suddenly stopped increasing and hovered within a thousand points from Huang Xiaolong’s.

“Has he given up?” Huang Xiaolong frowned, seeing this. But he quickly figured it out. It seems like Di Jing doesn’t plan to show all his trump cards; hence, he has ‘given up’ for the time being.

Above a mountain range within the Heavenly Court Secret Region, Heavenly Prince Di Jing checked the rankings board. He had just smashed a peak early Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Heavenly Demon into pieces with a punch. He sneered, seeing Huang Xiaolong’s sudden explosive rise in points, “Looks like this is your limit! In the end, this is your level. Even if I relented the preliminary round’s first place to you, so what? But Huang Xiaolong, you did not disappoint me. This is the only way I will be interested in killing you in the final round of stage battle.”

Huang Xiaolong’s performance in the preliminary round had raised a tsunami of shock in his heart.

Huang Xiaolong had cultivated for less than a thousand years, yet he had the strength to compete for the preliminary round’s first place with him!

This!

Up until this point, Di Jing was still finding it hard to accept this truth.

After all, he had the Heavenly Dao Godhead and Heaven’s Dao Physique. Logically speaking, his talent should be the highest in the entire universe. There was no possibility of anyone surpassing his talent.

But now, this Huang Xiaolong with less than a thousand years of cultivation was competing for the top spot with someone like him, who had three thousand cultivation years!

This point made Di Jing’s usually expressionless face slightly distorted. He really couldn’t figure out why there was someone more talented than him. After all, he had the number one divine physique and number one king of supreme godhead!

“Huang Xiaolong, go die!”

No matter what, Huang Xiaolong cannot be allowed to grow further! One mountain cannot accommodate two tigers, and I, Di Jing, won’t let a person with a higher talent and potential than mine survive in this universe! With this logic, Huang Xiaolong needed to die in the final round’s stage battle. Di Jing was determined to use everything he had to kill Huang Xiaolong. He also planned to search Huang Xiaolong’s memories to get all his secrets.

“I’ll kill whoever dares to hinder me at that time! Huang Xiaolong, you’re destined to die by my hands!” Di Jing’s killing intent was so ferocious that it was corporeal, turning into death gods by his side. At this time, Di Jing was no longer the Heavenly Court’s Heavenly Prince, but an overlord of death.

......

On the plaza, everyone was dumbfounded, watching Huang Xiaolong’s points explode upwards.

Yu Shi and the rest of Heavenly Court’s marshals sat dazedly on the high stage.

“Even, even His Highness is squeezed down by Huang Xiaolong?!” Yu Shi’s face was extremely gloomy.

At area sixty-one, Zhao Lei’s mind was completely blank as he looked dazedly at the rankings board. His lips trembled as he spoke, “This, this kid, is he really my personal disciple? Is he really our Huang Xiaolong?!”

He even suspected if it was someone with the same name.

But it was written clearly on the rankings board—Huang Xiaolong of the Fortune Emperor Palace. Fortune Emperor Palace had only one person named Huang Xiaolong. In other words, that name in the first place was really his personal disciple, Huang Xiaolong?!

Suddenly, Li Shan’s face darkened. He said to Zhao Lei and Fang Xuanxuan, “Look at Xiao’er’s name!”

Zhao Lei and Fang Xuanxuan quickly looked at where Peng Xiao’s name, which was in 3,532nd place. At this time, her name was too dim, as if it was about to vanish at any moment.

Both Zhao Lei and Fang Xuanxuan paled visibly.
