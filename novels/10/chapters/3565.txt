Chapter 3566 – Depths of the Unknown Space

“Huang Xiaolong, release us immediately!”

“The Dragon Overlord will never let you off!”

Meng Tian and Huang Sheng roared desperately.

Tightening his grip, the flames emerged from his body and incinerated the two of them. Howls emerged from their lips instantly.

“We’ll talk when he comes.” Huang Xiaolong muttered before sealing their grand cosmos energy. He tossed them into the Sun Moon Furnace without a care in the world.

After dealing with the two of them, he turned to the others. It didn’t take long for all two hundred experts to be suppressed.

“Xiaolong, should we be worried about the Dragon Overlord?” Huang Long asked.

“We’ll deal with it when the time comes. Even if the Dragon Overlord comes, I’ll be there to stop him.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

With 13.4 billion units of grand cosmos energy and the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong truly wasn’t worried that the Dragon Overlord would come. After all, he would probably reach 15 billion units of grand cosmos energy after devouring Huang Sheng.

“That’s right… Brother Huang Long, the Dragon Overlord might possess shocking strength, but Xiaolong has three great worlds! He will definitely be the strongest in the thirteen universes!” Ao Xing grinned. “It won’t be long till Huang Xiaolong unifies the thirteen universes.”

The Blazing Dragon smiled, “Now, I’m afraid even ten of me won’t be Xiaolong’s match.”

“That’s not possible, right?” Huang Long stared at the old dragon in disbelief.

However, the old dragon chuckles in amusement the next second. “Aren’t you at the peak of the grand completion stage? You should understand how strong someone is when they break through the 10 billion units mark.” The moment anyone breaks through the 10 billion units mark, they would enter a whole new realm!

Ao Meixia chuckled, “He’s right. Even if Ao Xing and I work together, we won’t be able to block a single strike from Xiaolong!”

Huang Long stared at them in shock.

The Star Dragon Couple were half step Universe Gods! Even so, they weren’t confident of taking a single hit from Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Long looked at his son, and he was greeted by an annoying smirk on the brat’s face. It seemed as though they were right. If Huang Xiaolong had barely broken through the 10 billion mark, he might have fought to a draw with the Star Dragon Couple. Now, he has 13.4 billion units of grand cosmos energy! The strength he possessed was frightening!

Huang Long felt a trace of joy when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s silent admission that he could defeat the Star Dragon Couple.

…

After Huang Xiaolong gave the order for Zhu Yaowen and the others to clean up the battlefield, he returned to the imperial palace with the old dragon and the rest.

When everyone had settled down, Huang Xiaolong told them everything that happened in the First Universe.

He told them that he had more than eight hundred Gods of Creation serving under him back in the First Universe.

“In the future, I’m going to have to rely on you, you little brat!” Huang Long chuckled in amusement.

Everyone roared with laughter.

Soon after, the blazing dragon arranged for a giant banquet. It was to celebrate Huang Xiaolong’s strength, and to celebrate Huang Sheng’s capture.

When the banquet was over, Huang Xiaolong started to treat Huang Long’s injury. He released Huang Sheng from the Sun Moon Furnace with a smirk on his face.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you think you’re doing?!” Huang Sheng could guess what they were going to do when he saw Huang Long and he started to panic.

“What am I doing?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “Did you forget what you did to my father? I’ll return the favor right now. I’ll give you a taste of getting your bloodline refined!”

Obviously, it wasn’t a nice feeling for one’s bloodline to be refined!

When Huang Sheng was desperately struggling and yelling, Huang Xiaolong sent countless roots of the Star Dragon Divine Tree into Huang Sheng’s body. He sucked out Huang Sheng’s bloodline bit by bit.

He didn’t take the power for himself as he transferred it to his father, Huang Long!

Sitting in the air, Huang Long circulated his secret art to receive the power. As Huang Sheng’s strength came from him in the first place, it didn’t take long for him to recover his strength. His injuries healed rapidly.

Eventually, he returned to his peak state.

A smile could be seen on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he asked, “Father, how do you feel?”

Huang Long nodded his head as he felt his strength returning. “It’s back! In fact, I’m pretty sure I grew a little stronger.”

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. “That’s great.”

He finally treated Huang Long’s injuries!

In order to save his father, Huang Xiaolong had been through a lot! Now, he could finally relax.

Now that Huang Long had recovered, Huang Xiaolong chose to enter the seclusion to refine Huang Sheng’s remaining bloodline and his grand cosmos energy.

Huang Sheng struggled unceasingly when Huang Xiaolong devoured him, but he failed to change his fate.

Tens of thousands of years later, Huang Sheng reached the limit.

“Huang Xiaolong, I curse you! I won’t let you off even in death!” Huang Sheng screamed. “In the future, Lord Dragon will capture you and make you suffer a life worse than death! He will extract your soul” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong grabbed Huang Sheng by the neck and snorted, “Not to worry. I’ll extract your soul before that happens!”

After he spoke, he started to look through Huang Sheng’s soul.

A frown formed on his face. He planned to look for clues on the Dragon Overlord in Huang Sheng’s mind, but it seemed as though the man didn’t know much either. He only knew that the Dragon overlord was located in the depths of the Unknown Lands. He didn’t even know the Dragon Overlord’s true strength!

“Unknown Lands…” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. The Dragon Overlord was actually located at the depths of the Unknown Lands!

From what Huang Sheng knew, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Unknown Space was massive! It was connected to all thirteen universes. He could enter the Unknown Lands from the Blazing Dragon Universe, but the only problem was locating the entrance.

Huang Xiaolong became more and more interested in the Unknown Lands. The Universe Boat was located there too, and Mei Jie was somewhere within. Now, this unknown expert known as the ‘Dragon Overlord’ was there too!

What in the world did the Unknown Land contain?!

When Huang Xiaolong searched through the souls of Meng Tian and the others, he discovered that there was a powerful restriction around their memories. Even with his strength, he couldn’t break through the restriction.
