Chapter 3007: Exterminating You Guys is a Piece of Cake

“We wouldn’t dare!” Ao Xin and the others quickly fell to their knees.

Seeing how the members of the Holy Dragon Race were on their knees, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at everyone else. When he swept his gaze across the Heavenly Phoenix Race, Radiant Winged Dragon Race, and the rest, he chuckled. “On your knees!”

The faces of those from the Heavenly Phoenix Race, Radiant Winged Dragon Race, and the others changed.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you mean by this?!” Feng Ming’s expression sank as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “We didn’t make the bet with you.”

“Huang Xiaolong, who the f*ck do you think you are? Do you think we’ll be afraid of you?” Ao Ji raged, “If you really anger the Holy Dragon World, we’ll band together to kill you! No matter how strong you are, you won’t be able to stop us all!”

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. He turned to look at Feng Ming and Ao Ji before giving them a final warning. “Am I someone you can call by name? You choose to disrespect my identity as the Son of Creation, and you’re committing blasphemy on my father’s name! I’ll give you one last chance to admit your mistakes!”

A look of terror started to spread on their faces.

Blaspheming the God of Creation! No one had the guts to commit a crime at that level!

However, what Huang Xiaolong said was true. He was the Son of Creation, and they were disrespecting him!

A look of mockery formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he looked at Ao Ji. “If I want you to kneel, you better get on your knees. That’s because I’m the Son of Creation, and you’re a mere member of the Huang Long World! As for the entire Holy Dragon World ganging up on me… Are you threatening me?!”

Killing intent emerged from his eyes as he continued, “Since you dare to threaten me, it seems like your respect for my father, the God of Creation, is non-existent. If you shatter your physical body right now to atone for your sins, I can allow your dao soul to leave! If you choose to apologize, I will spare your Radiant Winged Dragon Race. Otherwise, I’ll exterminate your race today!”

The faces of Ao Ji and the other members of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race turned unsightly.

However, Ao Ji soon broke into laughter. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think you can do as you please in our Holy Dragon World? Do you think my Radiant Winged Dragon Race will roll over and die?! Even if you’re the Son of Creation, exterminating my race isn’t something you can do on a whim! Heh. I would really like to see how you destroy my race with just the Tortoise Ancestor!”

“Moreover, you better think twice before making your move on my race. We have a lot of allies in the Holy Dragon World, and the Giant Golden Dragon Race is one of our best allies!” A sinister smile formed on Ao Ji’s face. “So what if you’re the Son of Creation?! Do you think I’m afraid of you?!”

As soon as the words left his lips, the members of the Giant Golden Dragon Race and the Coiled Dragon Race gathered behind the members of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race.

Looking at the smug expression on Ao Ji’s face, Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned cold. “Exterminating your races is a piece of cake. I won’t even need to do it personally.”

In the past, he might have defeated Huang Shuai and the Heart Devourer Twin Devils, he knew that there were many peak powers in the Divine Tuo Holy World who weren’t taking him seriously. After all, he was an individual who fought alone.

Now, he had the perfect chance to show off his power to the Divine Tuo Holy World! With more than five hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables under his command, individual strength was no longer the scariest thing about Huang Xiaolong! Of course, defeating the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor was a step in the right direction, but it wasn’t enough!

Since they were asking for it, Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind using the Radiant Winged Dragon Race as an example. He would start a bloodbath in the Holy Dragon World to warn the rest!

Ao Ji roared with laughter when he heard that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to take action personally. “Do you think the black tortoise alone is enough to exterminate my race?! What a joke!”

He was greeted with a terrifying sight as soon as the words left his lips. More than five hundred figures appeared behind Huang Xiaolong, and a horrifying pressure descended on the lands. The space started to crumble under the weight of the auras emitted by over five hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables. Everyone present felt as though several trillion chaos essence mountain peaks were pressing down on their chests.

Even with his strength, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor found it hard to breathe.

Staring at the experts behind Huang Xiaolong, they gasped in shock.

“Senior… Senior Old Monster Flame!”

“Is that Lord Ming Fu?!”

“That’s the thirteen disciples of the Yin Ming!”

…

The hearts of everyone trembled when they recognized those standing behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Didn’t they go missing in the Blue Lotus Pond?!” Ao He felt his eyes popping out of their sockets.

Why would everyone who went missing in the Blue Lotus Pond appear behind Huang Xiaolong?!

Moreover, it seemed as though the Old Monster Flame and other super experts at that level were Huang Xiaolong’s slaves!

Ignoring their shock, Huang Xiaolong’s frosty voice rang through the air. “Exterminate the Radiant Winged Dragon Race and everyone allied to them.”

“Yes, Your Highness!” The Old Monster Flame and the rest bowed respectfully before charging into the crowd.

Seeing how the peak-level experts had set their sights on them, Ao Ji started to panic and he screamed, “Wait! Wait! Huang Xiaolong, we can talk this over!”

“No! Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong, I…”

Before he could finish his sentence, he was sent flying with a single slap from the Old Monster Flame.

Miserable screams rang through the air, and a one sided massacre took place in the Dragon Cloud Sea.

There were even some experts of the Giant Golden Dragon Race and the Coiled Dragon Race who collapsed in fear.

They kneeled on the ground and begged for mercy, but Huang Xiaolong remained passive.

The killing continued, and it didn’t take long for the stench of blood to assault the noses of everyone present.

With a total of more than three hundred Dao Venerables, the three races thought that they were more than capable of stopping Huang Xiaolong if he wanted to move against them. However, a large group of them were only low-level and mid-level Dao Venerables. How could they stop over five hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables?!

The experts of the Heavenly Phoenix Race and Holy Dragon Race watched on as the members of the three races were slain. The scene was extremely bloody, and the experts on Huang Xiaolong’s side were monsters to begin with. They wouldn’t show any mercy when killing their enemies, and it didn’t take long for the battle to end.

Feng Nana and Ao He felt their faces going green when they saw how the Nine-Headed Tree Demon, Poison Bodach, and the others killed their way through the experts of the three races.

In ten short minutes, the ‘battle’ ended.

Golden rain poured down on the lands as a bloody mist formed in the skies over the Cloud Dragon Sea.

Huang Xiaolong grabbed the dao souls of Ao Ji and the others, and he dragged them before him.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re too blood thirsty and you’ll die a horrible death!” Ao Ji roared in his last ditch effort to free himself. “One day, the Huang Long World will crumble because of you!”

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong sent a wisp of nirvana flame towards Ao Ji’s dao soul. Since his cultivation journey started, he received too many threats and curses. One more from Ao Ji wouldn’t affect him. Ignoring the screams of those from the Radiant Winged Dragon Race, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the members of the Holy Dragon Race.

Without making a sound, they fell to their knees.

Next, he looked at the members of the Heavenly Phoenix Race.

Feng Ming’s expression changed.

“Feng Ming offended Your Highness, and I hope you can forgive us.” He chose to kneel, and Feng Nana followed closely behind. With their bodies swaying slightly, they fell to their knees.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s next sentence sent them all to the depths of hell. “I gave you a chance. Feng Ming, Feng Nana, do you think I’m oblivious to what you were thinking of during my battle with the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor? It’s too late now.”

Raising his head, Feng Ming could feel the blood draining from his face. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Kill them all.” Huang Xiaolong’s order rang in the ears of everyone present.

The Old Monster Flame and the others lunged at those of the Heavenly Phoenix Race, and the battle was even less intense than when they killed the members of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race previously. Feng Nana’s body exploded, along with the experts trying to protect her.

With bloodshot eyes, Feng Ming roared in anger. “Huang Xiaolong, I’m going to kill you!”

Summoning every last ounce of his strength, he charged at Huang Xiaolong.
