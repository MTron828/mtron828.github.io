Chapter 2646: Do You Want Me to Stay and Protect You?

Something round and golden was located in Huang Xiaolong’s lower dantian. Seemingly, the raindrops of heavenly energy had condensed into this ball of light that resembled a golden energy whirlpool, and it was turning slowly.

What is this?

Huang Xiaolong was bewildered.

He had never heard his masters, Cangqiong Old Man, or the Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, Lord Long, or Elder Crow mention this kind of situation. But, without a doubt, this thing was born from heavenly energy.

He could feel as the golden whirlpool turned, heavenly energy was also slowly flowing through his body.

After a good half a day of studying the golden whirlpool, Huang Xiaolong still couldn't figure out the ins and outs of it. In the end, he gave up and thought of asking the Heavenly Master later.

Huang Xiaolong adjusted his mood, and then took out a pellet of grand dao pill he had gotten from the Flying Heaven Hidden Treasury. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This grand dao pill had soft resplendent light enveloping it, reflecting dao laws. This grand dao pill resembled a powerful existence that would absorb holy spiritual qi like a True Saint expert, and it had a life of its own that was comparable to a True Saint Realm expert.

Moreover, the grand dao pill’s energy was purer than a True Saint expert’s saint attributes. The grand dao pill was purely a product of harmonious dao energy and dao laws.

In Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, a holy pill still had some imperfections, but the grand dao pill in his hand was flawless and perfect. Not even a blemish could be found on it.

‘I wonder, how did the Flying Heaven Race’s old ancestor Fei Wushuang come about this grand dao pill?’ while admiring the grand dao pill, Huang Xiaolong wondered to himself. Clearly, Fei Wushuang had not refined this grand dao pill. In the entire Holy World and Alien Lands, no one knew the method of refining grand dao pill, and obviously, there was no marking of any sort belonging to the Flying Heaven Race’s expert on this grand dao pill.

Perhaps, can it be that this grand dao pill is not something that belongs to the Holy World and Alien Lands? Did Fei Wushuang find this grand dao pill from somewhere…? Could Fei Wuhsuang’s disappearance be related to this?

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong threw the grand dao pill into his mouth.

Immediately, an ocean of grand dao energy roared as it flowed to every corner of his body.

Huang Xiaolong swiftly circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to absorb the grand dao energy and grand dao laws.

While Huang Xiaolong was fully immersed in absorbing the grand dao pill's benefits, a certain news was quietly spreading fast.

"Huang Xiaolong is the Son of Creation? It was said during the Flying Heaven’s sacrificial ritual, his bloodline’s power took on the image of the God of Creation Yellow Dragon! Many Flying Heaven Race's core disciples witnessed it!"

"Impossible! How could Huang Xiaolong be the Son of Creation! Since when is there a Son of Creation or God of Creation in this world!”

Although Fei Yanzi had banned the tribe from mentioning the events during the sacrificial offering ritual, still, some details spread out, causing a stir and raising many doubts.

Despiting causing quite a stir, the majority did not believe that Huang Xiaolong was the rumored Son of Creation. Does someone like that even exist? Everyone listened to it like it was a funny joke.

Yuan Wangfeng reported the rumors to Yuan Qianxing, and after listening to it, Yuan Qianxing laughed it off, “What Son of Creation? In that case, I can I’m the Son of Origin and also the God of Creation. Leave it up to the Flying Heaven Race to think of something so ridiculous.” He took it for granted that the Flying Heaven Race was deliberately spreading such a rumor.

And the Flying Heaven Race’s intention was to create momentum for Huang Xiaolong.

Are they doing this to make it more convenient for Huang Xiaolong to gather support from the alien races’ royal families to raise Huang Xiaolong’s favorability and confidence to win the Mansion’s young master position?

“My thoughts exactly.” Yuan Wangfeng chuckled. “There is no God of Creation in this world, and the rumors about the God of Creation originated from Fei Wushuang that old man. This piece of heaven and earth came into existence through natural phenomena.”

Whether it was the Holy World or the Alien Lands, everyone believed heaven and earth had come into being by itself. Still, a small number of people believed the world was created by the God of Creation, and believed in the God of Creation’s existence.

Yuan Qianxing’s tone turned icy as he spoke, “It looks like Feitian Longpeng and Fei Yanzi are adamant to stand on Huang Xiaolong’s side. In that case, when the Mansion’s young master position is in my hands, the Flying Heaven Race will be the next after I deal with Huang Xiaolong!”

After winning the Mansion’s young master position, he needed an opportune chance to show his authority and deter others, and in this circumstance, the Flying Heaven Race was the ideal target.

According to Yuan Qianxing, after successfully annihilating the Flying Heaven Race, his prestige would reach a new peak, indirectly eliminating the many troubles he might face once he sat in the Mansion young master position.

“Pay attention to the Flying Heaven Race’s movements.” Yuan Qianxing said to Yuan Wangfeng, “I’m going into seclusion to study the Return to Origin!”

Recently, he had gained some insights, and he believed that before the Mansion’s young master battle, he could completely grasp the Myriad Origin Race’s Return to Origin dao art. After accomplishing that, his combat strength would rise to another level, and killing Huang Xiaolong would be nothing more than slaughtering a mongrel.

“Rest assured, Your Highness, it will be done properly,” Yuan Wangfeng swiftly complied.

Time flowed by…

In the blink of an eye, a decade and a few years had passed.

In these dozen years, Huang Xiaolong had not taken a step out of the palace arranged by the Flying Heaven Race. There was nothing but cultivation in his days. After refining his first grand dao pill, he went on to refine the second one.

In this little over a decade’s time, Huang Xiaolong had refined and absorbed six grand dao pills, and his cultivation had reached the limit of peak late-Third Heaven True Saint Realm.

Through refining and absorbing these grand dao pills, Huang Xiaolong’s comprehension towards the grand dao had risen significantly. Moreover, under the tempering of grand dao energy and dao laws’, his holy souls and saint attributes too had changed greatly in a positive manner.

During this period of cultivation, the golden whirlpool at his lower dantian also had changed greatly from it’s initial appearance. In the beginning, the golden whirlpool was merely tiny golden speckles gathered together, but now, these individual speckles had merged into one entity. At the golden whirlpool’s center, an independent space was growing.

What exactly was this space, Huang Xiaolong still could not determine at this point.

“It’s time to advance to Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong walked out from his palace while pondering, and decided to look for Fei Yanzi to discuss borrowing the Flying Heaven Race’s forbidden land as his breakthrough location.

His breakthrough to Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm would surely cause a big movement, and he wanted to use the Flying Heaven Grand Formation to block off some of the effects.

Huang Xiaolong soon saw Fei Yanzi at her palace and told her his plans, resulting in Fei Yanzhi staring at him wide-eyed. She looked at Huang Xiaolong in bewilderment. Truth be told, she had not expected Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation to have reached the peak of late-Third Heaven True Saint Realm in such a short time.

From early Third Heaven True Saint to peak late-Third Heaven True Saint Realm in a little over a decade… What kind of concept is that? Did I miss something while growing up?

She had never come across this kind of situation nor had she heard of anything similar.

After her shock receded, Fei Yanzi nodded her head in agreement. Then, she personally led Huang Xiaolong towards the forbidden land, and activated the Flying Heaven Grand Formation.

When all these things were done, she turned around to leave, but then stopped in her steps. She faced Huang Xiaolong and asked shyly, “You, do you want me to stay and protect you?”

There was a gentleness and delicate quality to her shyness that could stir the heartstrings.

Huang Xiaolong was caught off guard as he stared blankly at her and failed to respond promptly.
