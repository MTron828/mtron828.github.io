“Kill Huang Xiaolong! If Huang Xiaolong doesn’t die, our Devil World will face catastrophe!”

“Kill him!”

There were aggressive clamors to kill Huang Xiaolong from every corner of the entire Eternal Devil City!

The moment Huang Xiaolong’s identity as the Lord of Hell was exposed, it attracted the hatred of all Devil Races in the Eternal Devil City, as if they could only vent their hatred by killing Huang Xiaolong.

Both Gao Changran and Wang Fanning hastened to report the matter to Huang Xiaolong.

While the entire Eternal Devil City’s Devil Race was clamoring for his life, Huang Xiaolong was laughing instead.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong could still laugh at this juncture rendered Gao Changran and Wang Fanning speechless.

“Your Majesty, why don’t you leave the city as soon as possible?” Gao Changran cautiously tried to persuade Huang Xiaolong.

Imagining the sight of Eternal Devil City’s ten thousand plus Devil Races’ experts rushing to kill Huang Xiaolong, a chill snaked down Gao Changran’s spine, causing him to shudder involuntarily.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly spoke, “Who is the person who wants us to leave the Eternal Devil City the most?”

Both Gao Changran and Wang Fanning were taken aback by Huang Xiaolong’s question.

“It’s the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming, and the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor Chu Han!” Gao Changran blurted out.. After the words left his mouth, Gao Changran immediately understood what Huang Xiaolong meant.

“Your Majesty, you mean this matter is pushed to the cusp by Shi Ming and Chu Han’s group?” Gao Changran went on, “Do they want to borrow this opportunity to force Your Majesty to leave the Eternal Devil City under siege?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded and added, “That’s most likely their objective.” Then he sneered, “Since Shi Ming, Chu Han, and Feng Chu want me to leave the Eternal Devil City, I should stay here longer.”

Gao Changran hesitated, “However, Your Majesty, those Devil Race, they...?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, his mouth spread into a faint smile, and he said, “Just the thunder is loud, there is no rain. If someone dares to make a move, then I don’t mind killing a few chickens to deter the monkeys.”

“But I’ve heard the Violent Lightning Archdevil, Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors, and the Black Killer Sect’s experts have gone to meet with the Heavenless Devil Legion’s captain.” Gao Changran was clearly worried as he went on, “If they persuade the Heavenless Devil Legion’s captain, then...!”

If the Heavenless Devil Legion’s captain were to deploy the Heavenless Devil Legion to deal with Huang Xiaolong, that would be the worst of situations.

But Huang Xiaolong smiled reassuringly at them and said, “Don’t worry, even if all Twelve Archdevil Ancestors decide to deal with me, the Heavenless Devil Legion would not interfere in this matter.”

Gao Changran and Wang Fanning were bewildered.

Is Huang Xiaolong certain?

At this time, inside the Heavenless Devil Legion’s headquarters’ main hall, the Violent Lightning Archdevil, Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors, and Black Killer Sect’s Chief Cui Huajie, and others were seated in two rows on the left and right.

On the main hall’s master seat sat a rugged old man with lines of devil light running all over his body. The old man’s gaze was sharp as an eagle’s, with a fierce gleam that made others shudder.

This old man was none other than the Heavenly Devil Legion’s captain, who had been guarding the Devil World for billions of years. He had a high status and prestige in the Devil World.

In the Devil World, the twelve Archdevil Ancestors were venerated by numerous Devil Race’s experts, almost to a fanatic degree. However, none of the twelve Archdevil Ancestors nor the hidden powerful old monsters dared to slight or disrespect the Heavenless Devil Legion’s captain in any way.

With the Heavenless Archdevil Lord missing, the Heavenless Devil Legion’s captain represented the Heavenless Archdevil Lord from a certain aspect.

The atmosphere in the main hall was a little heavy and solemn.

“Lord Captain, we are certain of the Six Nether Gate’s black-haired young man’s identity. He is the new Lord of Hell who has been making waves in recent years.” Violent Lightning Archdevil spoke respectfully, breaking the heavy silence. “In the past, the Heavenless Archdevil Lord had led us to attack Hell, and Hell has killed countless of our experts and more than a trillion of our Devil World’s disciples. The feud between Hell and us is eternally irreconcilable!”

“Now, this Lord of Hell Huang Xiaolong appears in our Devil World and is acting arrogant in our Eternal Devil City. This is a blatant disregard to us!”

“We plead Lord Legion Captain to act with us to kill Huang Xiaolong, to uphold the prestige of our Devil World!”

Violent Lightning Archdevil’s voice boomed with righteousness and echoed endlessly through the hall.

The group of Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors, Black Killer Sect’s Chief Cui Huajie, and others held their breaths as they waited for a response. Their eyes were fixed on the Heavenless Devil Legion’s captain, Wang Teng.

Although the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors, Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie, and others had a high status in the Devil World, they had no qualifications to interject in front of the Heavenless Devil Legion Captain Wang Teng.

Wang Teng took a glance at Violent Lightning Archdevil and spoke tepidly, “Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s last order to me was to guard the Devil World. In the last billions of years, I have been strictly executing this order. It has been ten billion years and I haven’t forgotten the Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s order. I’d like to say that I am loyal to the Devil World. I believe no one would disagree, right?”

Violent Lightning Archdevil hurried to affirm, “Lord Legion Captain has been leading the legion to safeguard our Devil World for billions of years and has contributed greatly. No one in the Devil World disrespects Lord Legion Captain for it. No one dares to doubt your loyalty.”

The Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors, Black Killer Sect’s Chief Cui Huajie, and others nodded heavily in agreement.

Wang Teng also nodded slightly, then went on, “So, my sole responsibility is to guard the Devil World and protect the Devil World.”

Although Wang Teng did not spell it out, the meaning of his words was clear enough—he would not interfere in Huang Xiaolong’s matter.

Violent Lightning Archdevil became anxious and blurted, “Lord Legion Captain, Huang Xiaolong has gone up to the top of the Devil Tower’s ninth floor. Are you going to standby and watch an outsider like Huang Xiaolong become our Devil World’s Archdevil Lord? If Huang Xiaolong becomes the Archdevil Lord, our Devil World will be swallowed up by Hell!”

“At that time, there would be no Devil World!”

“Lord Legion Captain, you must consider this matter again! For the good of the Devil World, please take action!”

Violent Lightning Archdevil spoke with utmost sincerity as if he would be willing to die for the Devil World with just one word, moving others who hear his words. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

But Wang Teng remained unmoved. He shook his head and said, “Violent Lightning Archdevil, please go back. I won’t take action, even if I take action, it won’t be against Huang Xiaolong, but at the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Shi Ming and his group. If the six devil steles fell into their hands, our Devil World would really be nonexistent.”

Violent Lightning Archdevil, Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors, and Black Killer Sect’s Chief Cui Huajie were taken aback by Wang Teng’s words.

Wang Teng added, “So if you all really move for the good of the Devil World, you should be targeting Shi Ming, Chu Han, and Feng Chu instead!”

Violent Lightning Archdevil’s words choked, “...This” For a moment, he doesn’t know what to say.

“Alright now, send the guests off.” Wang Teng waved his hand, signaling the meeting was over, “Please return.”

Seeing Wang Teng’s firm attitude, Violent Lightning Archdevil could only give up and dared not even show any dissatisfaction towards Wang Teng. He stood up, cupping his fists at Wang Teng as he took his leave, “Lord Legion Captain, we’ll take our leave here.”

However, before Violent Lightning Archdevil stepped out from the main hall, Wang Teng’s voice sounded behind him, “If a new Archdevil Lord appears, I will adhere to the Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s previous order, lead the Heavenless Devil Legion and swear loyalty to the new Archdevil Lord. Violent Lightning Archdevil, I hope all of you remember Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s order.”

In the past, the Heavenless Archdevil Lord once ordered the twelve Archdevil Ancestors below him, if a new Archdevil Lord appears, they were to swear loyalty to the new Archdevil Lord.

Violent Lightning Archdevil merely grunted in response then left the Heavenless Devil Legion’s main headquarters with the rest.
