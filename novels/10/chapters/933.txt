The mansions neighboring Huang Xiaolong’s Sun Moon Residence were easily lifted into the air by the Ghost Refining Sect young man’s palm force. Those mansions had their own defensive formations, but against the young man’s palm force that was red like blood, their effects were insignificant.

The residents inside the buildings had no time to escape at all. Caught under the terrifying palm force, they died, exploding into scattered blood mist in the air. Their blood essence and godforce were all sucked away by the giant palm.

After drinking those cultivators’ blood essence and godforce, the blood-red palm actually grew bigger again.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated. His Buddhism godforce roared, expelling the corrosive force out of his body. Simultaneously, his body swayed, transforming into a primordial divine dragon.

A blue primordial divine dragon seemingly ten thousand zhang long suddenly appeared in the air above the Divine Dan City, letting out an earth-shaking roar.

Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claw slammed down as hard as possible.

The Eleventh move, Dragon Astounding the Fiendgod! Godforce from his Holy Dragon Supreme Godhead burst forth.

Waves of dragon qi formed a giant divine dragon, flying straight at the ghost palm.

Another thunderous boom reverberated in the air from the collision.

Destructive shockwaves swept outward in all directions, destroying everything in their path.

The impact also sent Huang Xiaolong, in his primordial divine dragon form, spinning back another several hundred li. At a closer look, blood was seeping out from underneath his dragon scales, flowing down his claws to the ground below. There were more scales shattered than those intact.

On the other side, the Ghost Refining Sect young man also tumbled back, but merely a dozen meters or so. The ghost qi enshrouding him roiled violently as he regained his balance.

“Primordial Divine Dragon Clan!” The Ghost Refining Sect young man exclaimed. Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s primordial blue divine dragon body, he was dumbfounded. Since when had a blue dragon existed in the universe?!

Just when the Ghost Refining Sect young man wanted to attack again, sounds of whistling wind came from several different directions.

Obviously, his fight with Huang Xiaolong had created too much disturbance, alerting other masters within the Divine Dan City. Quite of few of them exuded powerful auras.

Sensing this, the Ghost Refining Sect young man decisively gave up on the idea of attacking Huang Xiaolong again, but not before flashing him a sinister grin, “Huang Xiaolong, you really did gave me a big surprise. Blue divine dragon? Interesting! Five years later is the time when I will succeed the position of Ghost Refining Sect Chief, I wonder if you dare to step on the Path to Hell for a battle with me.”

Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong was slightly caught off guard.

This young man was actually the successor to the Ghost Refining Sect Chief’s position?!

“Oh right, I forgot to tell you. When a new Chief is taking up the position in our Ghost Refining Sect, they would kill a group of Highgod Realm masters during the ceremony as an offering to the Ghost God, and I am no exception. After coming out this time, I also captured a bunch of Highgod Realm masters, one of them seems to be called Ascending Moon Old Man. He is your Master, yes?” The Ghost Refining Sect young man chuckled again.

Huang Xiaolong’s face completely sank. His Master actually fell into the hands of this young man?

Having said what he wanted, the Ghost Refining Sect young man vanished from sight in a flicker. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In this short time, the masters rushing towards them further narrowed the distance.

In order to save himself from further trouble, Huang Xiaolong also vanished from the spot, deciding to leave first.

A few breaths after he left, the first of the masters arrived above the ruins of the Sun Moon Residence. This person was Sun Yi.

Surveying the appalling scene of damage below him, Sun Yi’s face looked extremely grim, and beneath it was ill-disguised trepidation. From the extent of damage he was seeing right now, the people who battled here were more likely than not a little bit stronger than him.

Sun Yi was still looking around when two figures arrived at the sound of whistling wind.

These two were none other than the devil clan Grand Elder Mo Zhenru and the Devil Son, Mo Su. Looking at the scene below, their faces weren’t that much better than Sun Yi’s.

“Huang Xiaolong’s Sun Moon Residence was around this area?” Mo Su suddenly spoke.

There was astonishment in his eyes, “Could one of the parties battling just now be Huang Xiaolong?”

Mo Zhenru shook his head, disagreed, “Judging from the remnant destructive energy here, it cannot be Huang Xiaolong. He doesn’t have such strength, merely one of the fishes in the same pond.” Mo Zhenru took another glance at the surrounding, “It’s just... did he die or has he fled?”

As more and more masters arrived at the scene, each of them revealed a grim expression seeing the ruins below.

When the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s law enforcement team arrived, Sun Yi ordered them to lock down the main streets within the vicinity and search any suspicious people, as well as check if there were any survivors nearby.

Above an empty courtyard at the edge of Divine Dan City, a faint light rippled as Huang Xiaolong appeared.

In a flicker, he easily entered the courtyard and randomly picked a yard, arranging a formation before he could relax slightly to sit cross-legged in meditation. He then swallowed an Undying God Pill and adjusted his breathing.

Although the Ghost Refining Sect young man’s ghost palm contained horrifying force, it was just some external injuries to Huang Xiaolong. This level of injuries didn’t count for anything. Adding his Instant Recovery ability, in less than half an hour, Huang Xiaolong had returned to his peak condition.

However, his eyebrows were tightly scrunched together at this moment. The old man actually fell into the hands of that Ghost Refining Sect young man’s hands. This was a problem, and not a small one at that.

Five years...

It seems it was inevitable for him to make a trip to the Path to Hell. That, however, was another problem. Even though it was common knowledge that the Ghost Refining Sect was located in the Path to Hell, where exactly was it? How was he supposed to rescue his Master at that time?

Huang Xiaolong shook his head as if he was trying to shake away every thought until the Grand Competition ended. Only then would he think of a way to save the Ascending Moon Old Man.

The night gradually gave way to morning. Soft crepuscular rays were shining on the horizon, the sign that another day had arrived.

Getting up, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred and disappeared from the yard faster than one could blink. Out on the street, he headed in the direction of the Union headquarters.

Today was the day of the Grand Competition’s second round. Regardless of others, he had to win the first place today in order for him to challenge Sun Yi. He planned to defeat Sun Yi with alchemy and take his life afterwards.

But the cherry on top was the fact that he could enter the Dan River to cultivate.

The Dan River was vital to improving his strength, helping his cultivation advance further, increasing his winning chances against that Ghost Refining Sect young man.

When reached the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, appearing the competition square, many participants who had successfully advanced to the second round were already there, talking about the battle yesterday that ruined several residences.

“Huang Xiaolong!”

“Didn’t they say Huang Xiaolong was killed yesterday? How is he still alive?!”

When the participants and people in the crowd spotted Huang Xiaolong, their expressions clearly reflected their surprise and shock.

The Sun Moon Residence’s damage led everyone to assume that he was already waiting in line for his next reincarnation.

Sun Yi, who was at the main terrace overlooking the square, appeared right in front of Huang Xiaolong in a flicker, snapping curtly, “Huang Xiaolong, what exactly happened last night? Where did you run to?”

From his tone and manner, anyone would think that Huang Xiaolong had committed the most unforgivable crime.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even spare a glance at him, walking past him with an aloof expression.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong actually ignoring him, Sun Yi was outraged.

“Enough, Eminent Elder Sun. Today is the Grand Competition’s semi-final round, leave all other matters for later.” At this time, an Eminent Elder on the main terrace spoke.

This Eminent Elder was one of the Wangu Clan’s Grand Elders, Wangu Biran.

Several other Eminent Elders echoed their agreement to Wangu Biran’s words.

Sun Yi struggled. In the end, he snorted coldly but no longer insisted, returning to his seat on the main terrace.

Huang Xiaolong watched Sun Yi, a murderous glint in the depth of his eyes that went unnoticed. When the end of the grand competition came, it would also be the end of Sun Yi.
