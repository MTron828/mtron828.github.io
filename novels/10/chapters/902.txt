That Vermilion Bird Institute Elder’s tongue quivered as he spoke, shaking his head, unable to hide his trepidation, “Institute Principal, that Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong did not die! He didn’t die!!”

“He didn’t die?!” Qiu Baifei, He Feifan, and the other Grand Elders present looked dumbfounded.

“Did he flee?” He Feifan asked anxiously, “The Yelu and Beitang Families have so many masters, they actually let Huang Xiaolong escape?!”

Qiu Baifei was extremely upset, “Such garbage Yelu and Beitang Families, they have so many masters but they can’t even kill one Huang Xiaolong? They even let him escape!”

After hearing that Elder report that Huang Xiaolong did not die, Qiu Baifei, He Feifan, and everyone else naturally took it for granted that he had escaped.

There was no other possibility in their eyes.

The same Vermilion Bird Institute Elder answered fearfully, “No, Institute Principal, that Huang Xiaolong did not run away.”

“Did not run?” Qiu Baifei and He Feifan repeated with doubt.

“Could it be, both Yelu and Beitang Families were interested in his talent and they decided to let Huang Xiaolong keep his life?” Qiu Baifei muttered under his breath in doubt.

“No, it-it’s, both Yelu and Beitang Families’ masters are dead! No, n-no, the Yelu Family masters are all dead, and those Beitang Family masters who did not submit to Huang Xiaolong were also killed.” That Vermilion Bird Institute Elder dared not conceal anything, explaining fearfully.

“What?! All of the Yelu Family’s masters are dead? Killed by Huang Xiaolong?!” Qiu Baifei and everyone else jumped to their feet with deep shock on their faces, their eyes protruded, their minds buzzing.

“Yes, all Yelu Family masters were killed by Huang Xiaolong.” The Elder added cautiously, “Including their Patriarch, Yelu Chufei, not a single person escaped. Later on, Beitang Yiyang arrived, and he too died in Huang Xiaolong’s hands, but a large number of Beitang Family masters have chosen to submit to Huang Xiaolong, thus escaping death.”

Qiu Baifei, He Feifan, and everyone else were stunned agape.

Dead? All dead?!

Yelu Chufei actually died in Huang Xiaolong’s hands?! Beitang Yiyang too!

“Impossible, impossible!! Yelu Chufei, Beitang Yiyang, both of these people are high-level Highgod Realm masters, how could Huang Xiaolong be a match for them?!” Qiu Baifei vehemently shook his head, shouting as if he had lost reason.

He Feifan and the other present were also in disbelief, finding it hard to accept this news.

...

Black Tortoise Galaxy, Tumed World.

Inside an inn, Ancestor Cang Xiong and more than a dozen people were clinking wine cup, merrily toasting each other.

This group of people, Ancestor Cang Xiong included, were none other than the dozen Ancestor who had recently terminated their blood contracts with Huang Xiaolong.

“I wonder what the situation is like in Huang Clan Manor.” Ancestor Cang Xiong put down his wine cup, speaking without any concern.

“How else could it be? They were definitely all slaughtered, blood flowed into a river, with nothing left. Based on the Yelu and Beitang Families’ combined strength, forget a measly Huang Clan Manor, they could easily rampage through the four galaxies.” A Highgod Realm Ancestor answered carelessly.

“Thank God we were smart enough to terminate our blood contracts with him. Even though we suffered a bit of backlash due to that, it is still better than dying together with Huang Xiaolong.” Another one of the Ancestors laughed, adding, “The news of Huang Xiaolong’s death is likely to spread very fast throughout the four galaxies.”

“But, Shi Xiaofei that little wench, what a pity. She really was an enticing little girl.”

“Who can say for sure, maybe she is being used by both families right now. Just imagining her stripped naked, my lower part throbs.”

Everyone erupted in laughter. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

All of a sudden, one of them stopped laughing, hastily taking out his communication talisman with a disbelieving expression.

One of his disciples had just reported to him about the situation in the Huang Clan Manor. And the news was...!

“What wrong? Is Huang Xiaolong dead?” Ancestor Cang Xiong noticed that particular companion’s flustered expression, and made a joke, “Even if that Huang Xiaolong is really dead, you need not show such a shocked expression right?”

That Highgod Realm Ancestor wasn’t in the mood to laugh at all, his hand slowly extended out the communication talisman, speaking in a solemn voice, “You take a look.”

With doubt in his eyes, Ancestor Cang Xiong received the communication talisman and his divine sense swept over it. The smile on his face was frozen as disbelief and shock took over.

The other Ancestors detected their strangeness, and each of them took turns in reading the message within the communication talisman. In an instant, their merry mood vanished, leaving a gloomy silence hanging over their heads.

“How can it be that Huang Xiaolong is still alive? Impossible, how can he possibly kill Yelu Chufei, how could he kill Beitang Yiyang?!” One of the Highgod Realm Ancestors shrieked.

Ancestor Cang Xiong seemed paler than any other person there, mumbling to himself, “Huang Xiaolong didn’t die, but we terminated our blood contracts and betrayed him. Later, to us, he will surely...” Thinking of their impending doom, cold sweat trickled down his forehead.

The other Ancestors’ faces became ashen at the thought.

“How about we hurry back now and kowtow in forgiveness?” One of them suggested, his voice a bit scratchy.

“It’s no use, it’s already too late.” Cang Xiong shook his head.

Indeed, it was already too late. From the time they decided to terminate their blood contract, in Huang Xiaolong’s heart, they were already dead.

The reason they were able to live until now, why Huang Xiaolong did not kill them immediately, was to let them know Yelu Chufei and Beitang Yiyang’s ending. And now that they knew, their own deaths were not far away.

The news of Yelu Chufei and Beitang Yiyang having been killed by Huang Xiaolong spread throughout the four galaxies at an alarming speed. In a short period, the four galaxies’ forces were in an uproar, astounded. Of course, there were even more people feeling regret and apprehension.

Above all else was the astonishment about the fact that the previously missing Heavenly Mountain had actually been actually taken away by Huang Xiaolong! Huang Xiaolong was the mysterious master who took the Heavenly Mountain years ago!

Then came the news of Huang Xiaolong’s orders, that cultivators who had resided in Martial Spirit World and left before the two families’ attack would no longer be permitted to enter Martial Spirit World again.

Following that, another one of Huang Xiaolong’s orders spread out, ordering all four galaxies’ Patriarchs and Ancestors to gather at the Huang Clan Manor within one month’s time. Those who were absent would be killed!

Whereas those who could bring the heads of the Ancestors who had terminated their blood contracts with Huang Xiaolong would be rewarded with a hundred sacred grade immortal spirit stones!

As one order after another came from Huang Xiaolong and news of it spread out, the four galaxies were once again in an uproar, filled with unease and panic.

Due to the Huang Clan Manor’s extensive damage, Huang Xiaolong pushed back the wedding date to two months later, instructing Ancestor Bifang and the others to rebuild the manor.

Deep into the silent night.

Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged above the lightning dragon spiritual vein, absorbing its energy at rapid speed.

Although Yelu Chufei and Beitang Yiyang were dead, the Yelu and Beitang Ancestors were still alive. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong dared not relax, planning to completely refine the lightning dragon spiritual vein in two months, enhancing his cultivation further.

While he was in seclusion in order to refine the lightning dragon spiritual vein, inside the Vermilion Bird Institute’s great hall, Principal Qiu Baifei as well as the Institute’s Grand Elders were discussing the matter of Huang Xiaolong demanding that all Highgod Realm masters of the four galaxies travel to the Huang Clan Manor in one month’s time.

“That Huang Xiaolong is really lawless and arrogant! Who does he think he is, actually ordering us, all four galaxies Highgod Realm masters to assemble at the Huang Clan Manor within one month?!” He Feifan fumed, “We refuse to go over, let’s see what can he do to us. We’ll join hands with the four galaxies’ Ancestors and Patriarchs! I don’t believe he will dare to kill the Highgod Realm masters of all four galaxies!”
