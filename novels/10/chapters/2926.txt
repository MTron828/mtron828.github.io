Chapter 2927: That’s Him! That’s Huang Xiaolong!

As the Mystical Pavilion’s branch was in the Blue Lotus Creed in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, Huang Xiaolong would be able to arrive in a matter of days.

At his current speed, he could basically be considered teleporting. If Sixth Esteem Dao Venerables used all they had, they would only be able to travel several trillion miles through space. However, Huang Xiaolong was able to do the same by flying, and the amount of cosmos energy he used was basically negligible.

With Huang Xiaolong’s three worlds operating at full capacity, he was no weaker than Eighth Esteem Dao Venerables.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong told Long Jianfei and the others that he had already left seclusion, and that there was no need for them to worry about his well-being. At the same time, he notified Yin Yue and Feng Yue. The number of messages they had sent to him during his seclusion wasn’t something he could count on both hands.

Yin Yue’s message spoke about the Creation Ceremony, and how Huang Shuai might make a move on him during the event. She hoped that Huang Xiaolong would avoid showing up completely.

He could feel the concern she had for him through the messages she left for him.

As for Feng Yue, she spoke about opening the Frost Eye Race’s treasury, and she wondered if he ran into some accidents along the way.

While Huang Xiaolong rushed over to the Mystical Pavilion’s branch, Zeng Lei’s expression was ugly to the extreme. One could feel the rage smoldering in his eyes, and it felt as though flames were about to spew from them at any given moment. After his previous deadline, Huang Xiaolong had disappeared for ten whole years! He hadn’t even bothered informing Zeng Lei!

He felt as though Huang Xiaolong was looking down on his authority as a branch master of the Mystical Pavilion!

How dare that little f*cker…

If Huang Xiaolong were to appear before him right now, he would kill the brat without a doubt!

When Zhang Wen and the others stood before Zeng Lei, they felt killing intent rolling off his body in waves. Their limbs went cold, and they didn’t dare to speak a single word.

“Pavilion Branch Master, why don’t we invite some other expert?” Zhang Wen asked after thinking about it for a moment.

“Do you think I’m retarded? Have I not thought of that?! Old Monster Flame and the Maniacal Ancestor wants five billion Tuoshen dao coins before they are willing to make a move! They’re asking for much more than Huang Xiaolong!”

They were both users of the absolute blaze, and there was someone else called the Black Shadow Devil who he had failed to get a hold of.

Whatever the case, his only choice was Huang Xiaolong.

All of a sudden, Zhang Wen’s transmission symbol trembled. He stared at Zeng Lei for a moment before taking it out cautiously. When he read the newest message, a look of joy appeared on his face. “Pavilion Branch Master, Huang Xiaolong… Huang Xiaolong sent me a message!”

Huang Xiaolong!

The killing intent on Zeng Lei’s face disappeared faster than a lightning bolt on a clear day and he laughed happily, “Huang Xiaolong gave us a reply?”

He felt like he had found an oasis in a desert after enduring ten days of thirst.

Just several seconds ago, he was planning to rip Huang Xiaolong into shreds. However, the thought was thrown to the back of his head the moment Zhang Wen received the reply.

“Quick, quick, what did he say?” Zeng Lei didn’t even wait for Zhang Wen to reply. “Tell him I’ve got all twenty strands of beginning qi ready!”

Zhang Wen laughed bitterly. Throughout the years, he had sent the same message to Huang Xiaolong countless times.

“Lord Pavilion Branch Master, Huang Xiaolong said that he is currently rushing over. He says to prepare all the ingredients, and he will be able to arrive in five days. We can start the refinement process then.” Zhang Wen bowed and replied.

Roaring with laughter, Zeng Lei continued, “Great! Great! Tell him I’ve made the necessary preparations. We’re all waiting for him to start.”

Bowing respectfully, Zhang Wen sent Huang Xiaolong his reply.

Beside Zhang Wen, Chen Shaoen growled unhappily, “Lord Pavilion Branch Master, Huang Xiaolong wasted ten years of our time. He doesn’t even take us seriously. About this…”

A frosty light flashed through Zeng Lei’s eyes. “Of course we’ll deal with that. However, we can only make a move on him after he completes the pill. When he does, he will spit out a hundred times what he plans to take from me!”

Chen Shaoen snickered. “Lord Pavilion Branch Master, Huang Xiaolong still has a ton of blue lotus nectar left on him! He might even have the blue lotus itself!”

Blue lotus!

Blue lotus nectar!

Greed soon raged in Zeng Lei’s eyes.

“Also, I’ve heard that His Highness Huang Shuai, is planning on dealing with Huang Xiaolong. I wonder if the rumors are true…” Chen Shaoen continued, “Regardless, we should take him down after he completes the pill.”

Zeng Lei glanced at Chen Shaoen for a second, and he remained silent.

A thought flashed through Chen Shaoen’s mind in that instant. Silence means consent…

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Levitating Sacred Land where the Mystical Pavilion’s branch was located.

The Levitating Sacred Land was one of the two largest sacred lands in the Blue Lotus Creed, and Huang Xiaolong could see tons of flying ships lining the skies when he arrived. When he entered the cities, he saw mounts and chariots of the various families.

Regardless of which branch it was, the Mystical Pavilion was not to be underestimated. It was located in the most prosperous areas, and several rare grand dao pills would be put on sale by the Mystical Pavilion from time to time. Those were treasures even super chambers of commerce wouldn’t be able to get their hands on. Moreover, they would be able to deal with some problems even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables couldn’t.

As soon as he stepped into the city, he noticed countless people lining the streets.

“His Highness, the Son of Creation, will be undergoing the Creation Ceremony soon! This is probably the first and last event of its kind! I’ve heard that the Mystical Pavilion’s branch is selling an absolute beginning dragon crystal! I should buy that to present to His Highness during the ceremony!”

“What’s that worth? I’m planning to buy the Azure Dragon Skin for His Highness!”

“What?! Do they even sell that?! The Azure Dragon Skin is said to be the skin of the Great Azure Dragon which it shedded when it enters the high-level Dao Venerable Realm!”

“That’s right! However, it will probably cost several hundred million Tuoshen dao coins…”

Huang Xiaolong heard the discussion of several people before him.

He saw that they wore crimson gold robes, and from what he saw, they should be experts who came from a neighboring region.

With his dao souls covering the city, Huang Xiaolong discovered no less than a hundred Dao Venerables in the city!

Ordinarily, it would be hard to see even a single Dao Venerable! However, there were tons of them who turned up for the Creation Ceremony!

As he followed the crowd, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the branch of the Mystical Pavilion. He noticed Zhang Wen and the others standing at the entrance with a worried look on their faces. When they saw him, it was like they saw their savior and their eyes lit up. They quickly made their way over to him.

Many people recognized Zhang Wen, Chen Shaoen, and the others. They were high-level enforcers of the Mystical Pavilion, and they were Fourth Esteem Dao Venerables. Everyone was shocked when they saw the four of them welcoming an ordinary looking youngster.

“Who in the world is he?!”

Many people might have heard of the battle in Monarch Yu Sacred Land, but not many people recognized Huang Xiaolong.

“It’s him! It’s Huang Xiaolong!” Someone screamed all of a sudden. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“What?! Huang Xiaolong?! Is he the person who sent Xuanyuan Potian flying with a single kick?” Heated discussion broke out among the crowd all of a sudden.
