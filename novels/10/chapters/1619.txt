“Lord Jia Yuan!”

“We pay our respects to Lord Jia Yuan!”

Gu Fei hastily flew towards him and a brilliant smile broke out on his face. Cupping his fists, he greeted respectfully, “Lord Jia Yuan.”

Gu Zheng hesitated for a moment and he contemplated not going up to greet Jia Yuan.

Before he could move, Jia Yuan stared at Gu Fei with an indifferent expression before turning to Huang Xiaolong.

Gu Fei felt a little disappointed when Jia Yuan turned around and ignored his warm greeting, but when he saw that Jia Yuan had called Huang Xiaolong out in front of everyone, a burst of joy emerged in his heart. Under the gazes of everyone present, he slowly walked towards Huang Xiaolong.

By the time they could react, Jia Yuan was already standing before Huang Xiaolong.

“Lord... are you alright?” Jia Yuan broke into a smile and asked politely.

Lord?! LORD?!

Everyone nearly dropped their jaws in shock. Gu Fei and the members of the Gu Family felt their vision spinning as they stared at the scene before them with their mouths agape.

Everything seemed to fall silent in the instant Jia Yuan addressed Huang Xiaolong as ‘lord’.

Everyone looked at Jia Yuan whose face was about to split apart from his smile and felt that their world was about to start spinning.

This......

Gu Fei’s mind seemed to have experienced a massive explosion and he turned muddle headed in an instant. His previous guess was wrong, and he couldn’t be further from the truth. Jia Yuan was indeed there for the brat, but it was unexpected that Jia Yuan wasn’t there to capture Huang Xiaolong!

His expression changed.

Is Lord Jia Yuan here to...

If Gu Fei was able to think of it, then all the members of the Gu Family were naturally able to reach the same conclusion. Their expression turned sour and their bodies started to tremble.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the smiling Jia Yuan and a trace of suspicion welled up in his heart. Even though his results were extremely terrifying, someone like Jia Yuan shouldn’t have been able to learn of his identity.

“I’m fine.” Huang Xiaolong seemed to be lost in his thoughts as he shook his head at Jia Yuan.

By the time the words left his lips, the five captains and the Netherguards army arrived. When their gazes landed on Huang Xiaolong, a look of shock flashed through their eyes. Was Lord Jia Yuan acting as though the sky was collapsing because of this Asura noble?!

“Hehe, it seems like brother Jia Yuan is already acquainted with him.” Gu Zheng snapped back to reality and chuckled, “Brother Jia Yuan, it has been years since we last met. It seems like you have already risen to the position of the person in charge of the branch in Brookspring Plane... Congratulations.”

Even though Gu Zheng wasn’t related to Jia Yuan, they were old acquaintances. In the past, when Jia Yuan was still at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, he wasn’t the person in charge of the Brookspring Plane’s branch of the Netherworld King’s Organization. At that time, Gu Zheng had never thought that Jia Yuan would be able to break into the God King Realm in several tens of thousands of years and be sent to the Brookspring Plane by the Netherworld King’s Organization.

Gu Zheng then turned to Huang Xiaolong and he feigned magnanimity. “Since that is the case, I’ll pardon you on account of my old brother, Jia Yuan.” He cupped his fists and spoke to Jia Yuan, “Brother Jia Yuan, you should come over to my place when you’re free.”

“We’re leaving!”

As soon as he spoke, he led the members of the Gu Family and got ready to leave.

He could see that Jia Yuan’s relationship with the Asura noble before him wasn’t simple. Huang Xiaolong’s identity wasn’t as simple as he had thought either. After thinking about it, he decided to beat a hasty retreat.

“Wait.”

Just when everyone was thinking that everything was over, a casual voice ordered them to stop.

Everyone stared in shock and their stunned gazes landed on Huang Xiaolong once again.

Gu Zheng turned around as well.

“I didn’t say you could leave.” Huang Xiaolong slowly said.

A myriad of different expressions filled the faces of the crowd.

Gu Zheng’s face turned frosty and he chuckled, “Brat, do you think that I won’t be able to do anything to you just because you know Jia Yuan? Do you think that I won’t kill you just because Jia Yuan is here?”

“I’ll tell you now, my master is the grand elder of the Gu Family. Lord Wang Sinan from the Netherworld King’s Organization is my master’s friend. Lord Wang Sinan is the overseer of hundreds of planes and even Jia Yuan is only one of his subordinates!”

Gu Zheng’s icy voice resounded through the air.

He wanted to tell Huang Xiaolong that if he was still unwilling to let them leave, he could directly eliminate Huang Xiaolong without a care for Jia Yuan’s identity.

It was just a mere Jia Yuan...

With his identity and the relationship Lord Wang Sinan had with his master, Gu Zheng really didn’t hold Jia Yuan in high regard.

“Oh, I see. It’s just lord Wang Sinan.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t seem flustered in the slightest.

Some bigshot in the Netherworld King’s Organization? A grand elder?!

The authority level in the Netherworld King’s Organization was no secret. The person in the highest position was the Chief, followed by the senior commanders and the junior commanders. After that came the representatives of the various branches.

The representatives of each branch could be considered elders and there was a grand elder above them. Naturally, a grand elder held more power and authority than a regular elder.

Gu Fei looked at Huang Xiaolong in glee. “Are you afraid now, you brat?! Lord Wang Sinan can be considered god in the surrounding several hundred divine planes, including this! His words are the law here! In his opinion, our inspector is someone worth taking care of. I forgot to tell you, our inspector is the direct grandson of the grand elder of the Gu Family’s main branch!”

Gu Zheng raised his head haughtily and interrupted Gu Fei, “Brother Jia Yuan, I wanted to show you some respect by letting him off easily. However, I can’t do that after what he said to me.” A chilly expression appeared on his face and he sneered, “I’m feeling very uncomfortable now...”

He glared at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Little brat, you better kneel down and kowtow ten times right now. Otherwise...”

“What about it?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care less about him.

“Otherwise, the only other choice is death!” A terrifying light flashed through Gu Zheng’s eyes and the aura he emitted swelled rapidly. Blood red qi started to emerge from his body, as though he had turned into a massive crimson dragon. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Death?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t control himself and broke out in laughter. Even though his laughter seemed a little weird, he didn’t bother holding back. Raising his head, a streak of black light shot towards Gu Fei and the space between his eyebrows seemed to distort for a moment. A huge hole appeared in its place and Gu Fei, who had a delighted expression on his face, stood rooted to his spot. He stared at Huang Xiaolong with his mouth agape. He couldn’t believe what had just happened.

In the next moment, he fell towards the earth at record breaking speed.

“Ancestor!”

The members of the Gu Family yelled in shock.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned to Gu Zheng and he asked, “Is this what you mean?”

Gu Zheng stared at the lifeless Gu Fei and his face turned completely black. Killing intent surged around his body and the aura he emitted seemed to strengthen by manyfolds. He snapped at Huang Xiaolong, “Since you have chosen death, you can’t blame me.”

A blood red substance was released from his body and it showed no signs of stopping.

All of a sudden, the captains behind Jia Yuan yelled, “Protect the lord! Everyone, in formation!”

Even though they already knew of Huang Xiaolong’s strength, they had to take all precautions. After all, their orders were to protect Huang Xiaolong from any harm.

Twenty thousand Netherguards charged forward and formed a mysterious formation as they surrounded Huang Xiaolong.

Looking at the scene before him, Gu Zheng snorted and stared at Jia Yuan, “Jia Yuan, are you sure about this?”
