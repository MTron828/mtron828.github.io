Chapter 2776: Yi Xiaotang

While countless experts rushed to the location where Huang Xiaolong was rumored to be, two ladies were casually strolling down the street of a city under the Silver Sand Sacred Land’s jurisdiction. The young lady in the front was clad in soft, thin tulle. Her facial features were soft like the moon in the sky. She possessed beauty that could bring down a country, and she exuded inviolable holiness.

Although the latter lady was not as eye-catching in comparison, she was still a charming beauty.

“Xiaotang, let’s go back. You have sneaked out for a long time already and if your father learns of this, you’ll definitely be punished,” the lady persuaded earnestly.

A bright smile flashed over the young lady in front as she spoke, “If Aunt Qing doesn't tell, then who would know I sneaked out. It’s not easy for me to come out even once in a while. So, Aunt Qing, let me play for a few more days. Okay? In the Blue Heaven Heavenly Cave, there’s nothing to do but cultivate every day, comprehending grand dao day in and day out, and a swarm of flies buzzing around me. It’s so annoying!”

The lady called Aunt Qing wore a helpless expression on her face. Then again, she understood that Xiaotang was merely stating the truth. A daughter of heaven like Xiaotang not only had many admirers within the Blue Heaven Creed, but she also had suitors from the several nearby heavenly caves as well.

Aunt Qing changed the subject, “I heard that the Saint Devil Prince and his father are heading to the Blue Heaven Creed. Moreover, Yan San is likely to accept the Saint Devil Prince as his disciple in the next few years. At that time, your father definitely would go back to attend the Saint Devil Prince’s apprenticeship ceremony.”

At the mention of the Saint Devil Prince, the young lady named Xiaotang frowned slightly. “Who wants to attend that Saint Devil Prince’s apprenticeship ceremony. I am not interested in one.”

She still remembered the way that guy had stared at her the last time she had visited the Saint Devil Sacred Land with Yan San. He had looked at her as if he had wanted to swallow her. She had seen too much of this kind of gaze, and it totally disgusted her.

The Saint Devil Prince was also a fly in her eyes.

Aunt Qing was stunned, hearing that, and she asked a moment later, “You don’t plan to attend the Saint Devil Prince’s apprenticeship ceremony?” But she continued before Xiaotang answered, “Your father would be upset. You can miss the apprenticeship ceremony of other hall masters, but Yan San is the Blue Heaven Creed’s grand hall master after all. Not to mention, Yan San can be considered as a half-master to you!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As the leader of Blue Heaven Creed, Dao Venerable Qing Xiao rarely had the time to guide his daughter’s cultivation. Hence, most of the time, it was Grand Hall Master Yan San, and Blue Heaven Creed’s Eminent Elders who guided Yi Xiaotang. It wasn’t too much to say Yan San was half a master to Yi Xiaotang.

Yi Xiaotang was slightly irritated, “Alright, alright, I know. Yan San and those people nag me when I’m at Blue Heaven Creed. When I’m outside, Aunt Qing is the one who nags me. I really don’t know what Yan San thinks to accept that Saint Devil Prince as his close disciple!”

Aunt Qing smiled, watching Yi Xiaotang and said, “The Saint Devil Prince’s talent is quite good, otherwise, why would Yan San want to accept him as his close disciple? The Saint Devil Prince cannot compare to you, but he’s stronger than Ceng Lin and Yan San’s other personal disciples. Honestly, I think you and him are a good match. If you’re choosing a dao companion, why don’t you give the Saint Devil Prince a chance?”

Yi Xiaotang became even more irritated. “Aunt Qing, can you stop it already? That Saint Devil Prince is a fly, I would rather die than choose him as my dao companion. My future dao companion can only be more talented than me, and he absolutely cannot be weaker than me.”

Aunt Qing shook her head. “Not only within the Blue Heaven Heavenly Caves, but even in the nearby several heavenly caves, there is no disciple more talented than the Saint Devil Prince. Your demands are too high!” She paused before sighing regretfully, “Similar to you, I also had very high demands, and I missed my opportunity to be with some good people..”

Yi Xiaotang pursed her lips in silence.

“Okay! Okay! Since you don’t like to listen, I won’t say anymore.” Aunt Qing smiled to ease the tense atmosphere.

Only then a smile appeared on Yi Xiaotang’s face. “I know that Aunt Qing loves me the most.”

The two strolled along the street when the conversation of a group of people walking in their direction attracted their attention.

“Say, how do you guys think that Huang Xiaolong would end?”

“How else could he end? Once the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts arrive, he’s going to be a dead man. He is going to die in the worst possible way!”

“But many people at the Saint Devil City witnessed Huang Xiaolong personally destroy Chen Hong and the others’ dao physiques. If that’s true, then probably, no one from Nine Revolutions Sacred Land would be able to deal with Huang Xiaolong!”

“How can you believe this kind of rumor? Huang Xiaolong’s merely a Ninth Heaven True Saint, so how could he possibly destroy Chen Hong’s body? Chen Hong was a Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor. Moreover, other than Chen Hong, there were also the Nine Resurrection Primal Land’s Cheng Feng and forty-plus Primal Ancestor experts present. How could a Ninth Heaven True Saint destroy a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor’s body? There’s no way that could’ve happened!”

The conversation of the group in front of them surprised Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing.

A Ninth Heaven True Saint destroyed a Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor’s physique? Even destroyed a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor’s physique? There were witnesses?

“This person called Huang Xiaolong actually destroyed a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor’s physique while being only a Ninth Heaven True Saint?” Yi Xiaotang muttered under her breath in amazement.

But Aunt Qing shook her head and smiled dotingly, “Xiaotang, don’t tell me you really believe that kind of rumor? It’s absolutely impossible. No genius in the entire Divine Tuo Holy World is capable of that at True Saint Realm, including those in the ranks of one dragon, two tigers, and three moons. Being capable of destroying a Primal Ancestor’s physique at True Saint Realm would make one a heaven-shaking genius, and if such a freak really exists, it would shake the whole Divine Tuo Holy World.”

Yi Xiaotang nodded her head. Aunt Qing’s words sounded reasonable after some thought. If such a monstrous genius really existed, numerous heavenly caves in the Divine Tuo Holy World would have been alerted, and countless creeds’ experts would have fought to take this person as their disciple. They wouldn’t have left him alone to stay in the small Saint Devil Heavenly Cave.

“But according to those people, that Huang Xiaolong is nearby at an uninhabited land. Since we don’t have any plans, why don’t we go take a look?” Yi Xiaotang suggested.

“That… we better not.” Aunt Qing shook her head and disagreed, “You’re too precious, and if you’re accidentally hurt by those people, how am I going to explain it to your father!”

“How could they possibly hurt me? There is no Dao Venerable expert in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. Aunt Qing, you know how strong I am,” Yi Xiaotang said as she shook Aunt Qing’s arm and pleaded, “Aunt Qing, let’s go and just take one look. Okay?”

Aunt Qing shook her head, refusing no matter what Yi Xiaotang said.

Although she believed Yi Xiaotang was strong enough to protect herself, who could dare to guarantee a hundred percent that no accident would happen?

“As long as you agree, I will return to the Blue Heaven Creed with you!” Yi Xiaotang used her ultimate trump card.

Aunt Qing was surprised and asked smilingly, “Are you serious?”

“You have my word!”

“If we go there, you must listen to me, you can only watch from afar.”

“Set, I’ll watch from far, far away!”

In the end, Aunt Qing yielded with a wry smile. A while later, both of them left the Silver Yarn Sacred Land in the direction Huang Xiaolong was said to be. Their speed was faster than most, and they soon arrived at the said location. The uninhabited land was already crowded with many Saint Devil Heavenly Cave’s experts.

“Is that person Huang Xiaolong?” Yi Xiaotang looked around, and her gaze was fixed on Huang Xiaolong like everyone else.

Huang Xiaolong stood high in the air. His hair and the edges of his robe fluttered in the wind. He looked mysterious and exuded an unexplainable aura.

Aunt Qing looked at Huang Xiaolong. Her dao soul’s senses spread out to check him out from head to toe, and she couldn’t see what was so special about him.
