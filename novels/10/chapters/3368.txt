Chapter 3369: Immortal Origin Village

 

Looking at the giant hole he blew in the seal, Huang Xiaolong folded his hands behind him and returned to his original appearance. He looked like an ordinary mortal who couldn’t cultivate!

Turning to look at Yuan Hong and the others, their legs were jelly as they were postrated on the ground. Some of them even wet their pants.

All of them were existences in the Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm, and they stood at the peak of the Silver River Star System! Now, they couldn’t even stand straight!

The experts of the Immortal Palace were the same.

Not even Ye Zhaolong could remain on his feet.

There was no way about it. The punch Huang Xiaolong executed just a moment ago was too damn terrifying! Not even a Golden Immortal would be able to resist the aura coming from the punch alone, much less these Void Immortals.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and countless strands of grandmist qi entered the bodies of those present.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them after that before flying into the tunnel with Liu Huang.

As they traveled along the tunnel, they quickly arrived at the entrance to the Immortal World. Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to grab at the rays of light falling from the upper world and he muttered, “Feels pretty warm…”

Liu Huang stared at him in shock.

Pretty warm?! 

It was probably the first time someone described it that way!

The immortal light that descended from the Immortal World contained the endless laws of the world and it also contained a power they never felt before. Everyone would be afraid of the immortal light when they first saw it, but Huang Xiaolong seemed completely unaffected!

Of course, it was also the first time Liu Huang had seen anyone grabbing a ball of light like Huang Xiaolong.

Light was an object that wasn’t supposed to be tangible! Yet Huang Xiaolong was playing with it like it was a ball of dough!

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong’s figure started to blur as he entered the Immortal World. Liu Huang followed closely behind.

The moment he entered the Immortal World, Liu Huang could feel that the space around him was countless times bigger than in the Mortal World. 

Standing in the air, Huang Xiaolong looked all around him before turning to move in a certain direction.

Liu Huang looked around as he followed behind Huang Xiaolong, and he looked like a villager entering the city for the first time.

The Immortal World was a new experience for him, and he was dumbstruck by the sheer difference to the Mortal World.

After feeling the immortal qi in the air, Liu Huang finally understood why so many people would give it their all in order to ascend. Even if a pig were to breathe in the immortal qi, they would be able to cultivate to the level of the devil beast!

As for Huang Xiaolong, he knew that the Pangu Sword was in the Immortal World. However, he had no idea where to start looking, and they could only wander around blindly.

Just like that, the two of them strolled about for half an hour.

“Let’s go there to take a look.” Huang Xiaolong said as he pointed at one of the distant mountains.

When they arrived at the foot of the mountain, they saw a tiny little village.

The village was pretty small scale, and there were only three to four hundred people residing within.

When the two of them arrived, the sun was starting to set. Plums of smoke rose into the air and an air of serenity covered the area.

Kids were playing about at the entrance to the village, and they didn’t run away when they saw a stranger like Huang Xiaolong. Instead, they looked at him curiously.

“Big brother, why did you come to our Immortal Origin Village? Do you need anything from us?” One of the older kids in the group asked.

Huang Xiaolong could see that the boy was around twelve years old, and he chuckled, “We just entered the Immortal World and we have no place to go. We chanced upon your village and decided to look around.”

“Just entered the immortal world?!” The boy seemed to have thought of something and he cried out in amazement, “Did you fly up here from the Mortal World?” 

“Yup.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

The kid’s eye sparkled and he gasped, “Big brother, wouldn’t that mean that you’re an immortal?” 

Everyone in the crowd looked at Huang Xiaolong in amazement.

Even in the Immortal World, immortals were extremely prestigious beings.

It was especially so for a tiny village like theirs! They had always been striving to enter the Heavenly Immortal Realm!

The Immortal World might be filled with immortal qi, they needed to know powerful cultivation techniques and talent in order to reach the Heavenly Immortal Realm!

“You can say so…” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in amusement.

“Big brother, please wait for us here! I’ll get my father and the others out to welcome you!” The boy ran back into the village without a second thought. It didn’t take long before a group of experts emerged.

“I am Yan Shiming, the village chief.” The middle aged man in the lead cupped his fist towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Big brother, this is my father!” The boy grinned.

Huang Xiaolong greeted the man and they started chatting with one another. Soon after, Yan Shiming invited them into the village.

It was an endless honor for the village to play host to a Heavenly Immortal.

After they entered the village, Yan Shiming arranged for a banquet. He used the best spiritual fruits and wine they had to enteretain Huang Xiaolong.

“Immortal Huang, I heard from my son that you ascended from the Mortal World…” Yan Shiming said enviously. “You’re definitely a powerful talent if you manage to ascend… I’ve been training for tens of thousands of years and I’m barely at the Grand Completion Realm. I don’t think I’ll be able to enter the Heavenly Immortal Realm in my entire life..”

From what Huang Xiaolong could see, Yan Shiming barely entered the Seventh Level Grand Completion Realm.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “You’re pretty talented yourself. If you manage to learn a stronger secret art, you might be able to enter the Heavenly Immortal Realm.”

Tan Shiming shook his head. “It’s not easy to find a better cultivation technique. One needs to enter an immortal gate to gain access to their secret arts. However, every single disciple of the immortal gates needs to go through stringent tests! Less than ten people will be chosen out of tens of thousands of applicants!” Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, he sighed with resignation, “However, that isn’t the case for experts who ascended from the Mortal World. Any one of them will be able to join the immortal gates as their core disciples!” 

The envious look on his face couldn’t be hidden.

A core disciple of an immortal gate wasn’t something he could imagine! They would receive the best resources from the faction!

“Oh? Whose territory are we in right now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“We’re currently at the foot of the Storm Mountain, and we’re under the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate. They control the area in a thirty billion mile radius!” Yan Shiming turned serious and he continued, “I heard that the patriarch of the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate is a Golden Immortal!” 

“Golden Immortal? What are the cultivation levels in the Immortal World?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“One would arrive at the Divine Immortal Realm, Mysterious Immortal Realm, and finally, the Golden Immortal Realm!” Yan Shiming explained. “I have no idea what realm exists above that.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

He decided to remain in the village for several days before taking a trip over to the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

That very night, Huang Xiaolong assisted Liu Huang in breaking through to the Heavenly Immortal Realm. With his current level, it went without saying that Liu Huang broke through without the slightest problem. Huang Xiaolong also passed down a secret art that was hundreds of times better than that of ordinary techniques taught by the immortal gates.
