Chapter 3603 – Meeting The Blue Dragon Young Master

The structures Ying Wan tore through were carefully constructed by several Gods of Creation in the Yin Yang City, and it existed for an endless amount of time! Now, it was shattered by Ying Wan’s sorry figure.

Everyone in the city heard the resounding blast that rang through the skies.

As rubble rained down on the lands, Everyone ran about frantically, trying to dodge the pieces. The debris wasn't made from any ordinary material, and many of those who were struck by it vomited mouthfuls of blood.

Lin Xian stood high in the air as he looked at Ying Wan who was buried under several feet of rubble, and shock filled his heart. He quickly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong who was still enjoying a cup of wine in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion.

The Sons of Creation who hadn’t left the pavilion looked at Huang Xiaolong in utter fear.

Lin Yi and the two experts standing behind her couldn’t believe their eyes. Wasn’t the young man someone who used the identity of the Golden Manor? Wasn’t he Jin Hai’s son or someone related to him?! How in the world could someone at his level defeat Ying Wan with a wave of his hand?!

Silence fell upon the land.

When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, Ying Wan got up from the pile of destruction. The armor on his body was close to shattering, and there were multiple dents on it. It was clear Huang Xiaolong’s previous strike caused them.

“You?!” Ying Wan stared at Huang Xiaolong in equal parts terror and anger. The killing intent in his heart had long since diminished, and he snapped back to reality. Anger clouded his judgment earlier, but Huang Xiaolong’s revelation of strength forced him back to reality.

“I’ll spare your life seeing as you were clouded by your anger. If you try this again, I’ll kill you for real!” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

His voice rang loud and clear in the ears of those present.

Hatred and rage crossed Ying Wan’s heart, but reason took over. He managed to force himself to calm down as he asked, “Who are you?!”

“You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

“Alright, I’ll remember that!” Ying Wan snorted. He branded Huang Xiaolong’s title into the deepest part of his soul.

After he spoke, Ying Wan didn’t bother speaking to anyone else as he disappeared into the horizon.

Lin Xian wanted to ask him to stay, but Ying Wan moved too quickly. Lin Xian could only stare at Ying Wan’s leaving figure with complicated emotions. When Ying Wan left, he didn’t bother looking at Lin Xian at all. In his heart, the Yin Yang City was equally as responsible for his son’s death.

Sighing silently, Lin Xian didn’t know what to say. Whatever the case, Ying Wuyou died in his city. He definitely had to be responsible for the matter.

“Are you the Yin Yang Celestial Emperor?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang in his ear.

Jumping in fright, Lin Xian quickly snapped back to attention. He bowed respectfully, “That’s right, Lord Blue Dragon.” Even though Huang Xiaolong called Ying Wan to address him as the Blue Dragon Young Master, Lin Xian didn’t have the guts to do that.

One could see that he was extremely fearful of Huang Xiaolong.

“I’ve heard that your father wishes to trade a batch of universe-level spiritual veins for a top-grade creation artifact. Is that true?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Lin Xian stared at Huang Xiaolong with his mouth agape.

Weird emotions filled his heart. Could the man before him be there to carry out the trade?!

Was it possible that the man who dealt with Ying Wan came all the way over to the city in order to make the trade with the Yin Yang God of Creation?!

“Yes… That is indeed my father’s intention.” Lin Xian hesitated for a moment before explaining, “He is currently in the Limitless Celestial Empire due to the trouble caused by the members of the Ocean Race and the Ocean Beasts. The Limitless Master gathered all the experts he could find in order to think of a countermeasure.”

Lin Qiankun’s absence didn’t shock Huang Xiaolong at all. After all, he discovered it the moment he entered the city.

“He might not be here, but the universe-level spiritual veins should be here.” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Don’t try to bullsh*t me and tell me that your spiritual veins are not kept in your treasury.”

Lin Xian’s expression froze. That was indeed an excuse he was about to use.

“My father has to be the one to make the decision, and we should wait until he returns from the Limitless Celestial Empire.”

Ying Wuyou died in Huang Xiaolong’s hands, and Ying Wan had barely left. If he chose to make the trade with Huang Xiaolong, he might start a war with the Ying Ze Celestial Empire!

No matter what happened, he had to wait for Lin Qiankun to return before making a decision!

“Send a report to your father right now. Tell him that I’m willing to make the trade. When you receive his reply, you’ll be able to make the trade in his stead.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“This…” A hesitant look appeared on Lin Xian’s face. “Before he left, he mentioned that no one would be allowed to disturb him! He will decide on anything after he returns.”

“When will he be back?”

“I… I have no idea… He didn’t mention anything about it.” Lin Xian stuttered.

It was clear he wasn’t planning to give Huang Xiaolong a proper answer at all!

Appearing before Lin Xian all of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong released his aura. By the time Lin Xian noticed that someone was standing before him, he discovered that he wasn't able to move a single muscle!

Staring at Lin Xian coldly, Huang Xiaolong growled, “I see what you’re doing. Do you really think that you can ease your relationship with the Ying Ze Celestial Empire by wasting my time? What makes you think that you can afford to offend me?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

A chill ran down Lin Xian’s spine and he hastily explained, “Lord… Lord Blue Dragon, I…”

“Send a message to Lin Xiankun right now. I’ll wait for him here.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Yes, yes… I’ll contact my father right away!” Lin Xian no longer dared to pull any stunts. He retrieved his transmission symbol and sent a report on everything that happened to Lin Qiankun.

In the Limitless City, Lin Qiankun was chatting happily with other half step Universe Gods when he received the message. After reading the report, he was shocked.

“Blue Dragon Young Master?! He killed Ying Wuyou and injured Ying Wan with a wave of his hand… He wishes to trade a top-grade creation artifact with me?”

Those sitting around became curious when they saw the strange look on his face and one of them couldn’t help but ask, “Brother Qiankun, this…”

Lin Qiankun hesitated for a moment before showing them the report.

They were astounded when they read it.

“No one has ever heard of a God of Creation in the grand completion stage or above called the Blue Dragon Young Master…” Someone in the hall muttered. “Could he be from another region?”

He turned to Lin Qiankun and sighed, “Since we have nothing else to do, let’s follow fellow cultivator Lin back to the Yin Yang City. Let’s meet this Blue Dragon Young Master!”

Lin Qiankun revealed a smile and he chuckled happily, “If Lord Chen Huanzhi is willing to accompany me, things would be great!”

Chen Huanzhi was a half step Universe God who accumulated more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Even though he hadn’t reached the 11 billion mark, his combat abilities were far stronger than his cultivation level. Lin Qiankun had nothing to worry about now that an expert of Chen Huanzhi’s level was willing to follow him back to the city.
