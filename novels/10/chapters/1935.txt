No one dared to move a single muscle in their body when they witnessed the horrifying scene before them.

“Where are the experts from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union?” One of the disciples standing in the plaza asked with a blank expression.

As soon as the question left his lips, millions of pairs of eyes glared at him. He was so shocked that he shrunk his body.

Huang Xiaolong stared at You Wuguang and the others.

Raising his feet, he walked towards them.

When the several elders noticed Huang Xiaolong walking towards them, a look of uncontrollable fear appeared on their faces. They turned deathly pale. In their eyes, Huang Xiaolong was nothing short of a death god.

Even though he had displayed shocking strength when killing Wangu Wudi, they weren’t as shocked as when he had killed countless experts in a single second.

According to them, Huang Xiaolong was a single entity. No matter how strong he was, he wouldn’t be able to stand up to the combined strength of a hundred superpowers. There was no way he could go against several hundred thousand experts by himself. From what they saw, they felt that they were merely delusional.

Huang Xiaolong appeared before the few of them, and he spoke to You Wuguang. “Are you from the You Family?”

You Wuguang nodded his head in haste and replied, “Yes, yes, I am.”

“Didn’t You Wuye tell you? You can offend anyone you want other than me, Huang Xiaolong.” A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he chuckled in a low voice.

You can offend anyone you want other than me, Huang Xiaolong!

What an oppressive statement! It resounded through the hearts of everyone present in the plaza. Their souls shook when they heard what he said.

Despite his overbearing statement, no one dared to make a single peep. None of them felt that it was an overstatement.

When You Wuguang heard what Huang Xiaolong said, his body started to tremble. The fear in his eyes increased, and despair filled his heart. The person Huang Xiaolong had mentioned was the strongest ancestor of his You Family!

He was an expert from the You Family who hadn’t appeared in the world for several hundred years!

“Huang... Senior Huang, can you spare me for the sake of our old ancestor?” You Wuguang’s voice trembled as he begged for mercy.

Everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong denied the request by shaking his head. “For the sake of your old ancestor, I’ll allow you to die a quick death.”

You Wuguang felt his body going soft when Huang Xiaolong released his judgment.

By this time, Chen Xinghui, Yan Jinwen, and the others had already collapsed.

Huang Xiaolong stared at them with a cold face. Wangu Wudi had wanted to exterminate the Huang Family, and all of them were his assistants. There was no way he would allow them to live.

“After you die, I’ll tear your heads off as well. I’ll hang all of your heads on the city gates.” His chilly voice pierced deep into their hearts.

“What?!”

The Leng Family Patriarch’s expression changed.

“Senior Huang, you!!” You Wuguang was shocked, but he didn’t remain surprised for long. Rage filled his heart.

“If only you knew what was coming to you... It’s too late to regret it now.” Huang Xiaolong remained expressionless as he continued, “From the time you decided to plot against the Huang Family with Wangu Wudi, you already sealed your fates. Oh right, because of your plans, I’ll kill all the upper echelon and direct disciples of your family.”

Being benevolent to one’s enemy was like being ruthless to oneself.

In the past, he had spared the Ancient Demon Race and the Ghost Refining Gate. Right now, they were working together with the Wangu Family to plot against the Huang Family. Huang Xiaolong would never make the same mistake twice.

“You, you...!” Chen Xinghui, Yan Jinwen, and the others roared with rage. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Enough. Do you have any last words?” Huang Xiaolong no longer wanted to drag things out. “You wanted to work together with Wangu Wudi to exterminate my Huang Family. I’m only going to kill all your upper echelons and direct disciples. Your family still has a chance to survive. You should be grateful to me.”

You Wuguang and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong, dumbstruck.

“Huang Xiaolong, I admit that you are extremely strong! In the lower worlds, you can do as you please. However, you won’t be able to do the same in the Divine World! My You Family is a high ranked family in the Divine World, and if you dare to carry out what you said, the experts from my You Family will definitely hunt you down!” You Wuguang stared at Huang Xiaolong as a cold light flashed through his eyes. “You can wait to be hunted down in the Divine World by my You Family!”

“A high ranked family?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh when he heard how You Wuguang threatened him with a ‘superpower’ from the Divine World.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hold back his laughter.

There were countless Emperor Palaces in the Divine World, and a high ranked family meant fart in front of them. To him, exterminating a high ranked family was an order away. They would be blown away by his sneeze!

A high ranked family wanted to hunt him down?

Despite that, Huang Xiaolong became a little intrigued. He didn’t know how You Wuguang had managed to gain information on the Divine World. Could it be that the Divine World Envoy had revealed the situation from the Greater Worlds to him?

When You Wuguang saw how Huang Xiaolong was laughing, he raged again. “Huang Xiaolong, what are you laughing at? You have only ascended for a few thousand years! You have no idea how the Divine World works! Let me tell you. My You Family has several hundred thousand Heavenly God experts at our beck and call! With your talent, you should probably be at the peak of the Heavenly God Realm, right?”

Huang Xiaolong remained silent, and You Wuguang felt that he had finally managed to gain the upper hand.

“Haha! Huang Xiaolong, are you scared now?” You Wuguang snickered.

Several hundred thousand Heavenly Gods...

He felt that Huang Xiaolong would be overwhelmed by the strength of his You Family in the Divine World!

Huang Xiaolong shook his head in disbelief when he heard what You Wuguang said. He was too lazy to speak to You Wuguang any longer, and he twisted his head off with a flick of his wrist. He tossed it beside Wangu Wudi’s head.

You Wuguang revealed a face full of shock. He didn’t understand the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s decision to kill him after he had revealed the You Family’s terrifying strength in the Divine World.

After killing You Wuguang, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Chen Xinghui. In an instant, different colors flashed past Chen Xinghui’s face, and he spat,” Huang Xiaolong, our Chen Family has submitted to the Peaceful Sea Emperor Palace in the Divine World! Our Chen Family’s old ancestor is one of the generals serving under the Peaceful Sea Emperor!”

“Oh, Peaceful Sea Emperor.” Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second. Hadn’t he just met the Peaceful Sea Emperor before coming here?

“That’s right!” Chen Xinghui declared with confidence when he saw that Huang Xiaolong recognized the Peaceful Sea Emperor.

Before he could continue his sentence, Huang Xiaolong had already torn his head off. Off it went to join Wangu Wudi and You Wuguang.

Huang Xiaolong walked towards Yan Jinwen and asked, “What about you? Are you going to tell me how your Yan Family is connected to an Emperor Palace in the Divine World?”

Yan Jinwen turned deathly pale when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

No longer wasting time, Huang Xiaolong tore out all of their heads and sent them towards Wangu Wudi and the others.

The faces of the experts behind the family patriarchs finally changed.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to deal with them. He turned to Huang Xiaohai and the others. “Kill them all.”

Even though there were only two hundred experts from the Huang Family, they were more than enough to destroy the remaining Leng Family several times over.

In an instant, the Huang Family members turned into tigers pouncing into a flock of sheep. Miserable shrieks filled the sky as the Huang Family members unleashed all their rage after being repressed for so long. None of the members of the Leng Family managed to die with a complete corpse.

Some of their limbs were torn from their bodies, and some of them had holes blasted in their chests.

Huang Xiaolong turned around, and his gaze landed on Sun Man.
