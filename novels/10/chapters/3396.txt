Chapter 3397: Your Granddaddy Sun Is Back

“Even after joining hands, the Wudang Goddess and the Tortoise Spirit Goddess were defeated by Huang Xiaolong! How strong is that guy?! Didn’t they say that he barely entered the Sage Realm earlier?!”

“Huang Xiaolong deserves his reputation as the Innate Devil Ancestor! He’s as strong as the Heavenless Devil Ancestor himself! Hahaha! He’s going to kill everyone in his way! Look at the number of people who died at his hands in the past few days?! He killed Chen Keyu, Yang Kai, and now, he took Chen Chong’s life!”

“Chen Chong is the oldest disciple of the Crape Myrtle Heavenly Emperor. Now that he offended the heavenly emperor, he basically offended the entire Heavenly Court! I wonder how many powers he plans to go against…”

“Do you think the Crape Myrtle Heavenly Emperor will look for Huang Xiaolong?”

“What do you think?! Even the Wudang Goddess and the Tortoise Spirit Goddess were defeated by Huang Xiaolong. Do you think the Crape Myrtle Heavenly Emperor stands a chance?! He can only swallow his grievances!”

…

After Huang Xiaolong left the north, he returned to the Dongsheng God Continent.

Since the whereabouts of the other two were unknown, Huang Xiaolong could only wait for the Gathering of the Immortal Peaches.

He hoped that they would show themselves then.

When Huang Xiaolong was thinking about the Pangu Axe while riding on the Ice Rhino’s back, Xi Jiu yelled, “Your Highness, the Five Finger Mountain is up ahead!”

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

“Is that the mountain Buddha Rulai used to suppress Sun Wukong?”

“Yeah. That’s the one…” A look of fear formed on Xi Jiu’s face.

“Let’s go take a look,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Yes, Your Highness.” A look of excitement formed on Xi Jiu’s face all of a sudden as he turned to head towards the Five Finger Mountain.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to catch sight of the giant structure. It extended high into the clouds, and it was like a giant palm reaching for the skies. Immortal trees grew above the five peaks, and it was a majestic view.

That was the legendary Five Finger Mountain.

From top to bottom, the entire mountain was covered in a giant talisman. It was written in Sanskrit, and it could suppress the power of the great monkey king, Sun Wukong!

That was also the reason Sun Wukong’s Master was unable to save him after so many years.

As the talisman was created by one of Buddha Rulai’s most treasured artifacts, it was able to suppress almost anything in the Pangu World!

The Ice Rhino stopped when they were a million miles away from the mountain. He said, “Your Highness, we cannot continue onwards. Everyone would be suppressed by the talisman on the Five Fingered Mountain, and the closer we get, the stronger the sense of suppression.”

That was also the reason he could only bring Huang Xiaolong up to that point.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Wait here.” Huang Xiaolong got off the Ice Rhino’s back as he continued on towards the mountain.

The closer he got, the stronger the Buddhist light emitted by the talisman became. It slammed into him like a tsunami.

Ignoring it completely, Huang Xiaolong didn’t even slow down.

When he reached the one-hundred-mile radius around the mountain, a blinding ray of light emerged from the talisman. Waves of energy crashed into him, and Huang Xiaolong could tell that even Combined Dao Ancestors like the Wudang Goddess wouldn’t be able to hold out for long.

However, he was Huang Xiaolong! Clasping his hands behind his back, he continued without so much as a frown.

The Ice Rhino stared at Huang Xiaolong with his jaws dropping in fright.

Under one of the five peaks, Huang Xiaolong saw a sorry figure. Looking at the monkey stuck under the mountain, Huang Xiaolong saw the moss growing around its body. Grass and dirt could be seen sticking to its face.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head inwardly when he looked at the legend who once shook the heavens.

From the time Huang Xiaolong made his way towards the mountains, Sun Wukong had already noticed the changes in the talisman. A trace of hope formed in his heart when he saw Huang Xiaolong, and he screamed, “Lord, please save me!”

The arrogant Sun Wukong of the past would never plead with anyone else. However, the time he spent under the Five Finger Mountain tempered his spirit. His arrogance was long gone, and he wanted nothing more than to leave the goddamned mountain!

With his rash personality, being unable to do a thing while suppressed under the mountain was a fate worse than death!

“Why should I help you? You’re no friend of mine,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “I’ll save you if you give me a reason to.”

“As long as you save me, I’ll do anything you say!”

However, Sun Wukong seemed to have thought of something as he continued, “I’ll do anything as long as you don’t restrict my freedom!”

The only thing he cared about was getting out of there!

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Staring at him in shock, Sun Wukong didn’t think that anyone would agree so quickly.

When Sun Wukong was still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong reached out to tear the talisman off the Five Finger Mountain. It was like a piece of wet rice paper that tore the moment Huang Xiaolong laid hands on it.

Widening his eyes in fright, Sun Wukong looked at Huang Xiaolong.

He had experienced the terror of the talisman firsthand. Now, some random person he met tore it off without the slightest bit of difficulty!

“His handwriting is pretty good…” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

?! A complicated feeling formed in Sun Wukong’s heart.

“Lord, you… You… Get out of the way! I’ll come out right now!” He was afraid that when he emerged from under the mountain, the rocks above would crush Huang Xiaolong.

“Don’t worry about that.” With a single gesture, the entire mountain started to shrink. When it turned into the size of a pebble, it fell onto Huang Xiaolong’s palm.

Feeling the pressure around his body disappearing, Sun Wukong got to his feet. A bloodthirsty aura filled the skies as the ground around trembled. The skies changed color as the cries of fallen souls filled the air.

When the cultivators around the Dongsheng God Continent felt the change, their expressions changed.

“Who can it be?! Is it even possible for someone to be so bloodthirsty?!”

“That… That came from the direction of the Five Finger Mountain! Of no! Did the demonic monkey break free?!”

Countless powers fell into disarray.

As rays of light surrounded Sun Wukong’s body, it was as though the invisible shackles around him were shattered.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised to discover that the monkey king would be able to break through the moment he emerged. Moreover, he was breaking through several levels at once! The grand dao laws around Sun Wukong’s body covered the Dongsheng God Continent in an instant.

“Old fart Rulai, your Granddaddy Sun is back! Just wait! I’m not done with you!” Sun Wukong roared at the heavens.
