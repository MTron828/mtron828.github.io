Chapter 2202: Going to the Holy World together?

“Would you like to take a seat up here with me?” Feng Tianyu continued.

“Sure!” Huang Xiaolong agreed to his invitation. Retrieving the Golden Pig Treasure, he flew up into the air and sat down before Feng Tianyu.

To be honest, he had no feuds with the 33 Heavens Race, and if Feng Tianyu was willing to bury the hatchet, Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind putting down all the grudges they held for each other.

As for Feng Yao, he stood at the bottom of the gate and looked at the two strongest individuals in the Heavens Path.

Even though he wasn’t weak, he didn’t dare to approach the 33 Heavenly Gates. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s silent agreement to lay down the grudge, Feng Tianyu laughed heartily, “It’s no wonder you’ve managed to gain the identity as the strongest cultivator since ancient times!” He took out two wine jugs made out of jade, and he threw one to Huang Xiaolong. “Please.”

Huang Xiaolong popped the cap without hesitating, and an intoxicating fragrance entered his nose.

“This is the 33 heavenly fruit wine that I made myself using a hundred natural spiritual fruits found in the Heavens Path. I have only managed to brew two jugs in the past ten billion years, and this is my first time taking it out.” Feng Tianyu laughed, “If Brother Huang doesn’t mind, let’s drink till we’re drunk!”

A smile broke out on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he raised his jug in a toast to Feng Tianyu. A refreshing feeling washed over his body, and Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of warmth down to his bones.

“Good wine!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed.

The two of them clinked their jugs against each other and only stopped after ten full minutes of drinking.

“Truth be told, I’ve been waiting for Brother Huang at the 33 Heavenly Gates all this time. I plan to head over to the Holy World alongside Brother Huang!” Feng Tianyu wiped his lips and said.

“You plan to go to the Holy World with me?!” Huang Xiaolong was taken aback.

Feng Tianyu nodded, “I’ve been waiting to go over to the Holy World for ten billion years. However, one needs to gather all nine great chaos lightning pools in order to do so.”

In this case, why didn’t Feng Tianyu gather all nine great chaos lightning pools himself?

“Brother Huang, you have no idea how hard it is to gather them all. Not a single person since the beginning of time managed to do so. I’ve tried searching for them in the past, but I failed to gather all nine!” Feng Tianyu added when he noticed the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

... So that was the case...

“But, weren’t you the one who sent Yang Tianchen and others to search for the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool in the space outside the 33 heavens?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Feng Tianyu shook his head, “I only asked Yang Tianchen to look out for the Lightning Origin Divine Fruit. Looking for the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool was his idea.”

So that was the case...

“Even though Brother Huang has gathered the nine great chaos lightning pools, it’s not easy for us to ascend to the Holy World. From what I’ve read in an ancient book, we need to pass through the 33 Heavenly Space Passage after opening the 33 Heavenly Gates before we can arrive at the Holy World.” Feng Tianyu exclaimed.

“The 33 Heavenly Space Passage is filled with spatial lightning storms and a single moment of carelessness will cause us to die! Even after gathering all nine chaos lightning pools, there’s no guarantee that we will be able to pass through the space passage! If we work together to watch each other’s back, the chances of us passing through will be might higher!”

Spatial lightning storms?

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

If what he said was true, working together was Huang Xiaolong’s best choice. After all, Feng Tianyu was at the half step Venerable Realm. With the lightning attributed treasures in the 33 Heavens Race, Huang Xiaolong would be much more confident that they could arrive at the Holy World in one piece.

“Sure!” Huang Xiaolong thought for a while before nodding in agreement. After all, joining forces with Feng Tianyu to enter the Holy World was advantageous for Huang Xiaolong.

It’s better to make a friend than a foe.

Even so, with Huang Xiaolong’s current ability, he wasn’t confident that he could subdue a half-step Venerable like Feng Tianyu. He had no idea how long Feng Tianyu had been around for and how many cards the other party had up his sleeves.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s agreement, Feng Tianyu laughed and the estrangement between the two disappeared.

The two of them swore an oath to the heavens to form an eternal alliance between the Huang Family and the 33 Heavens Race.

“I need to make some more preparations to enter the Holy world. You’ll have to wait for another thousand years,” Huang Xiaolong said.

Feng Tianyu laughed, “It’s fine, I’ve already waited for tens of billions of years. What are another thousand more? As long as Brother Huang informs me of the time, we shall head to the Holy World together!”

“Great!” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Huang Xiaolong planned to make use of the next one thousand years to increase his strength. He planned to head to the space outside the 33 heavens to allow the nine chaos lightning pools to absorb the lightning spiritual qi for its transformation. As soon as it completed its fusion, Huang Xiaolong planned to revive his Senior Brother Jiang Hong. He also planned to look for the purple grandmist aura in order to push his Grandmist Parasitic Medium to the next level.

Of course, in the next thousand years, Huang Xiaolong also planned to accompany his family members and wives.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong left after saying goodbye to Feng Tianyu.

After Huang Xiaolong left, Feng Yao asked, “Father, are you not confident that you can take him on? After all, he’s only a peak late-Seventh Order Sovereign...”

Feng Tianyu shook his head, “You can’t judge Huang Xiaolong by his cultivation realm. The Giant Kun Ruler and Yang Tianchen wouldn’t have died at his hands otherwise. My cultivation at the half-step Venerable Realm would only put me on par with him. If he breaks through to the Eighth Order Sovereign Realm, even I wouldn’t be able to beat him!”

“With Huang Xiaolong’s talent, he would definitely turn into a dragon in the Holy World. It was definitely worth it to forge ties with him beforehand!”

“When Huang Xiaolong and I head to the Holy World, you will be in charge of the 33 Heavens Race. No matter what happens, make the Huang Family your ally!”

“Yes, father!”

......

After Huang Xiaolong returned to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, he announced the alliance he had made with the 33 Heavens Race before renaming the Giant Kun Heavenly Country. In the Heavens Path, the Giant Kun Heavenly Country would cease to exist and the Blue Dragon Heavenly Country would take its place.

Not long after, Feng Tianyu also announced his alliance with the Huang Family.

Several heavenly countries were disappointed at the news as they were looking forward to Huang Xiaolong’s showdown with the 33 Heavens Race. After all, fishing in muddy waters was a very profitable move!

Huang Xiaolong remained in the Blue Dragon Heavenly Country for several days before heading to the space outside the 33 heavens to locate the purple grandmist aura.

...

Time flew by.

In a blink of an eye, decades passed.

The nine chaos lightning pools had completed their fusion and the Grandmist Lightning Pool was formed. Jiang Hong came back to life and Huang Xiaolong quickly collected the materials to upgrade the Ancient Heavenly Court to a supreme spiritual treasure. Handing it over to Jiang Hong, Huang Xiaolong gave his senior brother the means to regain control of the Divine World.

With the help of the grandmist lightning pool, Huang Xiaolong swept through the space outside the 33 heavens and obtained an uncountable number of treasures. Not only did he manage to find a number of supreme spiritual treasures, but he also found dozens sources of purple grandmist aura.

After refining them all, Huang Xiaolong not only broke into the early-Eighth Order Sovereign Realm, but his Grandmist Parasitic Medium also reached the seventh level!

Soon, Huang Xiaolong returned to the Blue Dragon Heavenly Country. He spent time traveling the world with his family as he quietly improved his cultivation.
