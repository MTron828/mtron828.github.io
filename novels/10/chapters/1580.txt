Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a stranger to the fiery skull pattern on the flying ship! In fact, he was extremely familiar with it.

That was because it was the insignia of the Fiend God Emperor Palace!

When he had fought Wang Yongsen in the past, the insignia of the Fiend God Emperor Palace was embroidered on his robes for all to see!

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t understand how Zhou Chen managed to contact the Fiend God Emperor Palace.

Could this be a coincidence? Did the Fiend God Emperor Palace send people after me when they learned of my departure? Is Zhou Chen even related to this?

Of course, it was possible that Zhou Chen knew that the Fiend God Emperor Palace was antagonistic towards Huang Xiaolong and leaked the news of him leaving to them. Their appearance alone wouldn’t allow Huang Xiaolong to link them to Zhou Chen’s plot.

As thoughts were running through Huang Xiaolong’s mind, the four ships with the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s insignia stopped directly before his Dragon Shark Flying Ship. All four ships looked the same, but the ship directly facing Huang Xiaolong’s Dragon Shark Flying Ship was a little different from the rest. It was also a low-grade grandmist spiritual artifact and even though the other ships were a little worse in comparison, they couldn’t be considered trash. The other three ships were top-grade chaos spiritual artifacts.

The little cow who was lying on the deck raised her head and tutted, “The Fiend God Emperor Palace sure is rich... They can easily send out flying ships at the low-grade grandmist spiritual artifact level...”

The little cow wasn’t wrong. In fact, she was absolutely right. The Fiend God Emperor Palace was filthy rich. When the Demon God had unified the Emperor palaces in the past, he had raised a storm of blood that filled the Divine World. The number of powerful families that perished in the war couldn’t be counted and he managed to obtain god-knew how many treasures and spiritual stones. If they were to compare wealth, the Grandmist Emperor Palace might even be lacking when placed side by side with the Fiend God Emperor Palace.

“The other three ships aren’t bad either.” The little cow continued her running commentary. “Hey brat, you earned big this time!”

According to the little cow, the Fiend God Emperor Palace was here bearing gifts.

“Hey, Kiddo Huang, why don’t you give one of those ships to me later?” The little cow raised her front leg and pointed at the three ships at the back.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Sure. You’ll board the ship first and start the battle for all of us. If you can do that, you’ll get the first pick.”

Her excitement faded the moment she heard his terms and she looked like she was about to burst out in tears, “Nevermind! I’ll take the backlines!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hold back his laughter and a chuckle escaped his lips.

“Xiaolong, are we going to be alright?” Yao Chi grabbed Huang Xiaolong’s arm and asked with a worried expression on her face.

“Relax. We’re going to be fine.” Huang Xiaolong patted Yao Chi’s hand and reassured her.

All of a sudden, the entrances of the four ships opened and experts flew out to surround Huang Xiaolong’s Dragon Shark Flying Ship. All of them had the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s insignia embroidered on their robes and they numbered at least a hundred.

Moreover, all of them were at the Heavenly Monarch Realm!

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with any of them as his gaze landed on a tall and skinny elder who led the charge. The old man he was looking at had eyes that glowed an eerie green and the fingernails on his hand were as long and sharp as blades. The aura he emitted surpassed the other experts from the Fiend God Emperor Palace by several times.

The only people who can emit this kind of aura were... Emperors!

Only an Emperor Realm expert would be able to give off such pressure.

Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes as he wasn’t a stranger to the pressure the old expert was giving off. He was merely shocked at the fact that the Fiend God Emperor Palace was willing to send out an Emperor Realm expert to intercept him.

Huang Xiaolong sent Li Lu and Yao Chi back into the ship before heading out with the little cow, Xiang Xun, the Chaos Black Camel, Lei Budong, and Feng Chen.

The moment Huang Xiaolong emerged from his flying ship, everyone’s gazes landed on him.

A brilliant light flashed through the old expert’s green eyes.

“Huang Xiaolong...” A raspy and low voice greeted him as the old expert opened his mouth slowly.

“I never thought that the Fiend God Emperor Palace would send an Emperor Realm Cultivator over.” Instead of panicking, Huang Xiaolong wore an expression of indifference.

The old expert was stunned for a moment but he quickly snapped back to attention. His lips parted to reveal his yellow teeth as he laughed, “You’re pretty good. You are able to recognize my cultivation level before I even make a move. I haven’t been active lately but it’s alright, it won’t be too disgraceful for you to die by my hands, after all, you have a king of supreme godhead. You had a few more years to live but you had to force your way to hell... You grew too quickly and our Fiend God Emperor Palace is feeling the pressure. Remember my name, I am ancestor Wang Qi from the Fiend God Emperor Palace!”

Wang Qi? Huang Xiaolong felt a little baffled when he heard the name. Is he related to Wang Yongsen?!

“That’s right! I am Wang Yongsen’s grandfather!”

Yup... I was right.

Huang Xiaolong sighed in his heart and he turned his gaze to his party behind him. Xiang Xun and Lei Budong nodded their heads and Huang Xiaolong knew that there was nothing to worry about.

From what he saw, the two of them were confident in facing Wang Qi.

It seemed as though Wang Qi was merely comparable to a Second Order Emperor Realm cultivator.

When he thought about it, things started to fall into place. After all, he was merely a disciple at the God King Realm. It was surprising enough that they sent out an Emperor Realm expert to intercept him. Why would they send out a high level Emperor Realm expert?

In the flying ship, Li Lu and Yao Chi felt their pupils constrict when they heard that Wang Qi was in the Emperor Realm.

“Won’t Xiaolong be in danger now that the Fiend God Emperor Palace sent an Emperor Realm expert after him?!” Yao Chi asked in panic.

Li Lu was extremely anxious as well and she didn’t know what to do.

Even though the seal in Xiang Xun’s body was undone by Jiang Hong and he had managed to return to the Emperor Realm, Yao Chi and Li Lu didn’t know that! They even thought that Xiang Xun, the Chaos Black Camel, Lei Budong, and Feng Chen were all merely Heavenly Monarchs!

All of a sudden, Wang Qi swung his sleeves and ordered one of the experts near him, “Go. Kill those demonic beasts and those two idiots behind him. Only Huang Xiaolong needs to live.”

He was planning to deal with Huang Xiaolong personally.

However, before the expert could make his move, Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel unleashed a heaven-shaking roar at the same time. Darkness energy surged out of them like water out of a broken dam and all the ‘experts’ of the Fiend God Emperor Palace were sent flying.

All of them resembled ants as they were washed away by the storm-like darkness energy released by the two demonic beasts.

Wang Qi looked at the sudden change in situation and his jaws dropped. He stared blankly as his troops were all swept away.

Lei Budong and Feng Chen didn’t give him a chance to react as they rushed towards Wang Qi. The two of them attacked at the same time. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

As lightning revolved around Lei Budong’s body, a mighty gale formed around Feng Chen.

In just a few minutes, Wang Qi was no longer the mighty Emperor he once was. He was lying on the ground without a single breath of life left in him. Even in death, he wasn’t able to release the look of shock and disbelief on his face. An expression of regret and reluctance remained on his face already devoid of blood.

In the Dragon Shark Flying Ship, Yao Chi’s peach-colored lips were opened wide and Li Lu’s expression wasn’t too far off either.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother staying around and he ordered Xiang Xun and the others to clean up the scene. He swept everything into his spatial ring before controlling the Dragon Shark Flying Ship to head to his original destination.

...

Back in the Fortune Emperor Palace, Zhou Chen held a secret talisman in his hand as a look of disbelief appeared on his face.

He had just obtained news from the Fiend God Emperor Palace about the failure of the operation.

“No, no, no! This is not possible! How can this happen?!” Zhou Chen roared in denial.

The Fiend God Emperor Palace failed to eliminate Huang Xiaolong!

Moreover the ancestor they had sent on the mission, Wang Qi, was slain! One had to know that Wang Qi was a mid-Second Order Emperor Realm expert!

“Huang Xiaolong!” instead of screaming in anger, a sinister laugh escaped Zhou Chen’s lips.

“Good, very good!”

“Amazing!!”
