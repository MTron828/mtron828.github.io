Huang Xiaolong didn’t leave the courtyard after repairing the Devil Gourd. Instead, he raised the bottle of Devil Holy Water and swallowed a drop.

As soon as it entered his mouth, the drop of water turned into an icy river. It slid down his throat, and a comfortable feeling spread through Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The feeling of frost covered his body, and Huang Xiaolong felt as though he was drifting on his back along the icy river that held the Holy Devil Water. Despite the chill, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t feel the numbness on his skin. Instead, he felt that the chill had penetrated his body, deep into his heart and soul.

Waves of energy slowly formed and surged around Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to regulate the massive amounts of energy running amok inside him.

The moment he activated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, his three king of supreme godheads swallowed the mysterious energy, and Huang Xiaolong could feel the Heart of Hell thumping in his chest. Every time it pulsed, Huang Xiaolong could feel the mysterious energy seeping into the Heart of Hell. Of course, the Blood Eye Devil Stele in his body started to emit scarlet radiance when it felt the energy coming from the Holy Devil Water.

The three king of supreme godheads rotated and emitted multicolored light, and the Archdevil King of Supreme Godhead shone the brightest.

Huang Xiaolong was like a water fountain as the pores on his body widened and spat out blue gas. Traces of black and blue lingered in the gas as it dissipated around his body.

Those were the impurities hidden in Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Divine Physique and his godheads.

Along his path of cultivation, Huang Xiaolong had swallowed countless spiritual pills, and he had refined many divine physiques and tons of divine souls. Even though he had managed to force most of the impurities out of his body, there were still some traces hidden in him.

When Huang Xiaolong closed his eyes and circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, he felt like he had appeared in an icy blue world.

In a flash, one entire night passed.

Dawn had arrived by the time Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes after refining the drop of Holy Devil Water.

The energy contained within a single drop of Holy Devil Water wasn’t large, but it brought with it unimaginable effects. Huang Xiaolong felt his entire body loosening up even though he had only absorbed a drop of it.

He knew that the reason he felt comfortable all over was because his True Dragon Physique and divine soul had undergone a round of tempering. He could also feel that they had become much purer than before. Those were just the effects without mentioning the fact that every pulse of the Heart of Hell contained even more power than before, and his Archdevil Godhead felt as though it was on the verge of transformation.

Along with his Archdevil Godhead’s improvement, Huang Xiaolong felt as though he had gained greater insight into the devil energy source in the Devil World.

As for the Blood Eye Devil Stele, it emitted brilliant rays of scarlet light from time to time.

Right after Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation session, Gao Changran entered the room and reported to him, “Your Majesty, we received news that the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor and Chiyou Archdevil Ancestor have arrived in Eternal Devil City.”

“Oh.” A weird light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. They’re pretty fast. “What about Chu Han and the Silver Devil Sect?”

“We didn’t manage to get any news from them.”

“Could it be that Chu Han and the Silver Devil Sect have already arrived? You might have missed out on that point.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and explained.

Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that they were already in Eternal Devil City. However, they had probably entered with a different identity. It wasn’t abnormal for Gao Changran to fail to detect them.

Gao Changran swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

“Anyway, what about the Devil Tower?” Huang Xiaolong’s tone changed again, and he asked.

As soon as Gao Changran heard the words ‘Devil Tower’, he snapped back to attention and replied. “Reporting to Your Majesty, the light around the Devil Tower hasn’t disappeared for the past two days. With the radiance it is emitting, it might be opening soon!”

A light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “What do you think? When will it open?”

Gao Changran shook his head in disappointment. “That’s hard to estimate. It might be today, but there is a chance of it opening tomorrow. If I were to make an estimation, it would probably open tomorrow.”

Huang Xiaolong sighed. Tomorrow? It was much sooner than he had expected.

After asking Gao Changran some other questions, Huang Xiaolong dismissed him.

When he felt the multiple presence around the courtyard, he couldn’t help but chuckle. He ignored all of them as he swallowed another drop of Holy Devil Water.

When Huang Xiaolong swallowed his second drop of Holy Devil Water, another scene was playing out in the main hall of the residence the Heavenly Punishment Sect had bought. Xing Yinuo laughed and spoke freely, and a middle-aged man sat beside her.

Directly below them, the experts of the Heavenly Punishment Sect, Chen Weijian, and the ancestors of the Hundred Transformation Sect sat quietly.

“Nuo’er, were you obedient when I wasn’t around?” The middle-aged man laughed as he questioned her.

A cute pout formed on her lips as she complained. “When haven’t I been obedient? Why don’t you ask Li Yu, Wang Zhiqiao, and the others?”

The middle-aged man’s identity was pretty obvious. He was the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor, ranked number one out of the twelve Archdevil Ancestors. His position in the Devil World was similar to Jiang Hong’s existence in the Divine World.

Jiang Hong was publicly acknowledged as the number one expert in the Divine World, and the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor was the strongest expert of the Devil World.

The Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor chuckled, “Even if you behave like a spoiled brat, they will never dare to rat you out...”

Xing Tian, the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor, who was usually cruel and tyrannical beyond belief, was nothing more than a fatherly figure as he sat beside Xing Yinuo.

All the experts sitting in the hall laughed. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Their conversation finally came to an end, and Chen Weijian, who had remained silent the whole time, finally spoke up. “Senior Xing Tian, this junior came mainly because of the...”

Before he could complete his sentence, the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor interrupted him. “I know. You’re here because of the Devil Holy Water.”

Chen Weijian was stunned for a second, but a smile appeared on his face soon after. “Nothing can hide from Senior Xing Tian’s eyes. This junior is indeed here today because of the Devil Holy Water. The Devil Holy Water is a sacred item of our Devil World, but it was obtained by some random guy whose identity we cannot verify. This has caused a lot of resentment in my heart.”

Xing Tian laughed. “Are you planning to ally with my Heavenly Punishment Sect to snatch the Devil Holy Water?”

Chen Weijian growled in acknowledgment. “That’s right. Only experts like Senior Xing Tian will be able to utilize a sacred object of our Devil World fully. As long as you give the word, my Hundred Transformation Sect will bear the brunt of the blow and charge headfirst into battle.”

Xing Tian stared at Chen Weijian, and he paused for a moment before saying, “Even though I really want the Devil Holy Water, someone has already bought it fair and square. Moreover, it’s not possible for me to personally make a move in Eternal Devil City.”

Chen Weijian was stunned for a second.

“Senior Xing Tian...” Panic settled in his heart.

The Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor waved his hand and dismissed all of them. “Enough. This matter ends here.”

After half an hour, Chen Weijian and the Hundred Transformation Sect’s various ancestors left the Heavenly Punishment Sect’s palace. Chen Weijian’s face was gloomy, as he had anticipated gaining the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor’s support to snatch the Devil Holy Water. It was too bad Xing Tian refused to cooperate.

“Young master, are we going back now?” Elder Long asked.

“No. We’ll be paying a visit to the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor and the Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor.” A frosty light flashed through Chen Weijian’s eyes. “Since the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor refuses to get his hands dirty, we’ll ally with the other two Archdevil Ancestors.”

“This... young master, do you need to report this to the old ancestor before deciding on it?”

“No. I will be able to bear the consequences.”
