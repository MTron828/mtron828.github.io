Chapter 2734: Garbage

A scarlet golden light emerged from Tang Jin’s body as a phantom of a scarlet golden dragon formed behind him. He emitted an aura of majesty.

That was the grand dao art of the Tang Dragon Sacred Land. It was also the strongest grand dao law in the region!Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

As soon as Tang Jin unleashed his attack, a trace of Primal Ancestor’s aura filled the area.

A massive wheel appeared in the skies above him.

“Dragon Wheel!”

Numerous disciples in the hall exclaimed.

The Dragon Wheel was a dao artifact. If a disciple from the Tang Dragon Sacred Land used it in conjunction with their grand dao art, they would possess the ability to rock the heavens!

Yuan Yue hissed, “Great! Let’s join hands and kill him!” He leaped into action as he shot straight into the skies, and a terrifying cold wave emerged from his body as the space around him started to freeze.

A massive sword appeared in his hands, and everyone could see that it was another dao artifact. It slashed out towards Huang Xiaolong’s giant palm in the air as a wave of light surrounded the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak.

Unlike the Cangqiong Holy World where dao artifacts were scarce, there were tons of them in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

“When Senior Brothers Tang Jin and Yuan Yue team up, they can fight a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor even without their dao artifacts! Now that they are using them, there is no way Huang Xiaolong will be able to gain the upper hand!” someone chuckled smugly.

All the disciples in the hall nodded their heads.

The giant palm print finally arrived and the outcome shocked everyone present.

It slammed into the Dragon Wheel first, and it sent the dao artifact packing. The Dragon Wheel turned into a glorified kite, whose strike was broken as it flew through the skies. Before they could blink, the wheel was gone.

Yuan Yue’s sword light slammed into the palm print in the next instant and other than several sparks, Huang Xiaolong’s attack didn’t slow in the slightest. It continued on its way down towards the duo.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Tang Jin and Yuan Yue were gobsmacked when they looked at the incoming attack. By circulating whatever strength they had left in desperation, holy light covered their bodies as the aura they emitted increased once again.

With the entirety of their power, they sent out attacks of their own.

Two giant waves, one golden, and one black, flew up to meet the giant palm print.

It was too bad they couldn’t do a thing. They were suppressed instantly.

Bang!

The temple shook violently, and huge cracks appeared on the walls.

Everyone in the hall stared at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws agape.

Even though they had managed to unleash two different strikes in defense, everything happened in the blink of an eye.

They looked at the giant print in the middle of the hall as fear gripped their minds.

The looks in their eyes changed when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Tang Jin and Yuan Yue joined hands, they couldn’t even withstand a single palm strike from Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong’s face was cold as he dragged them towards him. They were in a sorry state, and blood stained their bodies red. From what it looked like, their bodies were about to split apart at any given moment.

Those in the hall sucked in a cold breath when they looked at the defeated Tang Jin and Yuan Yue.

“You… Huang Xiaolong, release Senior Brother Tang Jin and Yuan Yue at once!” The disciples from the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land cried out in indignation and grief.

However, Huang Xiaolong ignored them and looked at the two.

“I might not be anyone special, but you guys are no different from trash,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

The disciples from the two sacred lands stared at Huang Xiaolong in anger.

Tang Jin grinned as he sneered, “So what if you think I’m trash, you can’t kill me! Huang Xiaolong, just wait and see! Our sacred lands will exterminate your Cangqiong Sacred Land before you know it!”

Not only was he a peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saint, his holy soul was also protected by his master. He knew that Huang Xiaolong would be unable to kill him.

“This… I’m afraid I have to disappoint you.” Huang Xiaolong said coldly, “After all, I’ll be the one exterminating your Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land.”

Those seated in the hall looked at Huang Xiaolong like he was a mad man.

Tang Jin laughed loudly. “Huang Xiaolong, I really admire you! You must be a brave soul if you dare to say something like that!”

Before he could continue, Huang Xiaolong shattered his physical body and threw his holy soul into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

He did the same to Yuan Yue.

The disciples of the two sacred lands felt the blood draining from their faces. Never in their wildest imagination would they have thought that Huang Xiaolong would dare to destroy the physical bodies of Tang Jin and Yuan Yue.

Not even Wang Xueru and the disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land could believe what they were seeing.

We are finished!

Wang Xueru felt an explosion going off in her mind when Huang Xiaolong destroyed their bodies. She felt as though the sky was collapsing on them.

Every single power had sent their strongest and most cherished disciple to take part in the Convent of the Wind and Clouds. Tang Jin and Yuan Yue were the number one geniuses in their respective sacred lands!

Now, their bodies were destroyed by Huang Xiaolong!

He might not have killed them, but shattering their physical bodies was no different from crippling them!

Not even a Dao Venerable would be able to assist them in recovering their saint physiques!

Qiao Bai’s expression was complicated as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t know if Huang Xiaolong was acting impulsively, or if he was an idiot. Crippling Tang Jin and Yuan Yue was equivalent to declaring war on their sacred lands! If he had cripplied anyone else, there might have been room for negotiations! However, now that the victims were Tang Jin and Yuan Yue, the Tang Long Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land wouldn’t rest till they killed everyone in the Cangqiong Sacred Land!

Chu Zhouyun’s body froze when he noticed how Huang Xiaolong had dealt with Tang Jin and Yuan Yue without hesitation.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at him with a face devoid of expression. He threw over a single punch before throwing Chu Zhouyun’s holy soul into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

“Let’s go,” Huang Xiaolong said to the dumbfounded Wang Xueru.

Now that he had completely offended the three sacred lands, there was no need to stay around. Not to mention the fact that the Convent of Wind and Clouds would probably no longer take place.

Just as they were about to leave, the aura of a Primal Ancestor approached. It charged towards the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak at an alarming speed.

Qiao Bai was elated as the Primal Ancestors from his Ice Blue Sacred Land had finally arrived. If Huang Xiaolong were to escape, they wouldn’t be able to answer to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land! There was also the Chufan Sacred Land, but that wasn’t part of his considerations.
