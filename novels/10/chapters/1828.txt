After gaining some knowledge about the Devil World and the Devil World’s Eternal Devil Lands, Huang Xiaolong began making preparations for his trip to the Devil World.

In truth, there weren’t many things to prepare. He had recently collected the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s treasures. Hence he had sufficient spiritual pills, more than enough spirit stones, and flying ships too.

However, it was a pity that he did not have the Netherking Flying Ship by his side. Although the Black Dragon Throne was a high-grade grandmist spiritual artifact, it’s speed was still a little slow to his liking.

If the Netherking Flying Ship was by his side, he could reach the Devil World in the shortest time.

“What, you want to go to the Devil World’s Eternal Devil Lands?!” Zhao Lei, Fang Gan, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and others were genuinely astonished by Huang Xiaolong’s announcement.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and explained in a short sentence, “I got the news that Feng Chu fled to the Devil World.”

Of course, whether Feng Chu had fled to the Devil World or not, Huang Xiaolong had already intended to go to the Devil World. Not to mention, the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele were about to appear now.

This trip to the Devil World was a must!

“The Devil World is too dangerous, and your identity is extremely sensitive! If the Devil World’s Archdevils discover you, it would be bad for you! Moreover, the Eternal Devil Lands is one of the Devil World’s axes, filled with layers of restrictive array formations. Even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert could die there!” Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao both looked extremely worried.

“Kid, I say it’s fine if you want to go to the Devil World, but why must you go to the Eternal Devil Lands?” Zhao Lei demanded as he glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong understood that his Master and the others were concerned about his safety, so he smiled reassuringly and said, “It’s said that the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele are going to appear in the Eternal Devil Lands. This is also the reason Feng Chu has fled to the Eternal Devil Lands. So I want to go to take a look as well.”

“What?!”

“The Myriad Curses Devil Stele! Glaze Devil Stele!”

Everyone was shocked by this news.

A full two minutes later, Zhao Lei finally spoke, “Don’t tell me you plan to collect the Great Six Devil Steles and become the Archdevil Lord? I say kiddo, even if your luck is bafflingly heaven-defying, this is something impossible. You’re already the Lord of Hell, so you cannot be the Archdevil Lord!”

Fang Gan and the others nodded simultaneously in agreement.

Huang Xiaolong grinned and said, “Who made the rule that the Lord of Hell cannot be the Devil World’s Archdevil Lord?”

His question stupefied Zhao Lei, Fang Gan, and others.

There was no such rule indeed.

Although there was no such precedence, it did not mean this was impossible.

“But!” Zhao Lei shook his head as he went on, “The Devil World’s Archdevil Lord has been missing for many years, and various forces’ experts have been searching high and low for the six devil steles he left behind. I have not heard of anyone finding any one of the six devil steles. It’s easier said than done to gather all six devil steles. Why else did the Devil World not have a new Archdevil Lord for so long?”

Huang Xiaolong grinned.

Zhao Lei, Fang Gan, and none of the people present knew the fact that he had the Blood Eye Devil Stele, or they wouldn’t have been so pessimistic.

Precisely because he had the Blood Eye Devil Stele, Huang Xiaolong was confident there would be a harvest in the Devil World’s upcoming trip.

With the Blood Eye Devil Stele, his chances were much higher than Feng Chu and the rest with the same intention.

“When are you leaving?” Peng Xiao asked a moment later, then hesitated, “Why don’t... Xuanxuan and I go with you?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “The Devil World’s Eternal Devil Lands is too dangerous. I’ll be alright with the odd beasts with me, no need to accompany me. I know you all are worried about me, but it will be less dangerous with the odd beasts around me.”

“I’ll set off tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow? So soon!” Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao yelled out together.

“Since the rumors about the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele are circulating, it is likely to be true. Other than Feng Chu, there would be many other worlds’ experts entering the Eternal Devil Lands. So the sooner I get there, the better. I will set off tomorrow!” Huang Xiaolong explained.

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao gave up persuading Huang Xiaolong.

Early the next day, Huang Xiaolong left the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Huang Xiaolong had initially planned to leave two of the four odd beasts behind to protect Fortune Emperor Palace. But Fang Gan and Zhao Lei had refused and insisted Huang Xiaolong to take all four odd beasts with him, knowing that his trip to the Devil World would have dangers lurking in every corner.

Now that the Fiend God Emperor Palace was history, and Feng Chu had fled to the Devil World, the Fortune Emperor Palace was safe for the time being.

Defeated under everyone’s insistence, Huang Xiaolong yielded and promised to take the two odd beasts he had intended to leave at the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Before everyone’s gaze, Huang Xiaolong left the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong left the Fortune Emperor Palace, he summoned the Gate of Hell and crossed over to Hell. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The distance was much shorter from Hell to the Devil World.

Moreover, in Hell, he could take the Netherking Flying Ship, which was faster.

The Netherworld King’s Organisation also had a certain degree of influence in the Devil World. Before heading to the Devil World, Huang Xiaolong planned to have Desolate Giant Tai Yue contact the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s forces on the Devil World’s side and make arrangements accordingly.

He was unfamiliar with the Devil World. Thus it would be more convenient and smoother if people helped him with arrangements on the Devil World side.

Back on the Mohe Plane, Desolate Giant Tai Yue and the others immediately notified the forces below when they learned that Huang Xiaolong was heading to the Devil World’s Eternal Devil Lands.

The Netherworld King’s Organisation had some forces on the Devil World’s side and quite powerful ones. Among them were the Devil World’s Yin Crow Sect, Rear Demon Cult, and Six Nether Gate, and they were all secretly built by the Netherworld King’s Organisation. More importantly, these three forces were all first-ranked forces of the Devil World.

The Six Nether Gate among them was located on the Eternal Devil Lands.

After Desolate Giant Tai Yue contacted the Six Nether Gate’s Chief and exhorted the necessary arrangements, Tai Yue and the others reported Hell’s recent happenings to Huang Xiaolong.

“Your Majesty, the Eternal Devil Lands, is full of dangers. Why don’t we go along with you?” Tai Yue suggested. Jin Yuan and the others looked expectantly at Huang Xiaolong.

By now, the news of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele’s appearance had spread far and wide. Many forces of the Great Five Worlds had heard this news. Hence, Tai Yue and the others naturally knew about it.

Moreover, they knew the two devil steles’ appearance had alerted some old devils that had been living in seclusion for a long time. Some of these old devils belonged to the same generation of the last Archdevil Lord with terrifying strengths. This was the main reason Tai Yue was worried about Huang Xiaolong’s safety.

“No need, the four of you stay and guard the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s headquarters as a precaution against the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.” Huang Xiaolong refused, shaking his head.

“Your Majesty, we’ve got word that the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming might be heading to the Eternal Devil Lands too.” Asura King Jin Yuan informed Huang Xiaolong.

“Shi Ming is going too?” Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised.

Logically speaking, the most urgent matter for Shi Ming right now was successfully completing the Blade of Death’s forging instead of leaving the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters.

Not to mention that the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele were of no use to the forging of the Blade of Death. Unless... there was something essential for the Blade of Death’s forging at the Eternal Devil Lands?

“Your Majesty, maybe, we should go with you?” Demon King Fan Hui persuaded Huang Xiaolong once more.

Huang Xiaolong pondered for a while but still shook his head and refused, “No need, you guys still have work in Hell.”

After all, having more people didn’t guarantee the finding of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele speedily.

On top of that, he could return to Hell swiftly through the Gate of Hell after finding the two devil steles. So bringing more people was inconvenient.
