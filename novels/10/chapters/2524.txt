Chapter 2525: Opening of the Cangqiong Holy Manor.

Initially, Lin Yijia’s grudge with Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a mere squabble. However, after he was forced to kneel in front of the Blue Dragon Manor for an entire day, his hatred for Huang Xiaolong had reached the point of no return.

“The rat has a holy soul… It will be too difficult for us to exterminate his undying soul!” Chen Kaiping frowned.

Li Chen snapped, “It’s merely difficult. Not impossible. Even high-level True Saints can fall. He’s just a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint who has barely managed to form his holy soul!”

Xie Yao’s eyes turned cold. “That’s right. We can join hands with Xie Bufan from the Devil Palace as soon as we enter the Cangqiong Holy Manor. Qiao Jinyang from the Devil Palace will stop at nothing to kill Huang Xiaolong. As long as he gives Xie Bufan a dao artifact, Xie Bufan will be able to exterminate Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul!”

Li Chen nodded as a weird light flashed in his eyes.

Dao artifact from the Devil Palace?

Xie Bufan and Huang Xiaolong would be severely wounded at the very least after colliding with one another. When that happened, he could even kill them both off and keep the dao artifact of the Devil Palace! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

What a perfect plan!

…

In the Black Devil Star Prison, inside the Devil Palace…

Palace Master Qiao Jinyang, and Vice Palace Masters Cao Nan and Gu Tianmei sat in the main palace as a depressed look hung on their faces. Since the end of the Trial of Blood, they had never been able to free themselves from their worries.

Xiao Lengxue, Dou Rui, and Su Biqing had fallen in the Ghost Devil City!

They had lost three devil princes in a single event! They would be crazy if they found it acceptable.

Qiao Jinyang raised his arm, and a half-moon shaped blade appeared in his palm. As soon as it appeared, terrifying blade intent swallowed the hall. Traces of cracks appeared in the space around the blade.

Horrifying traces of grand dao swept through the hall, and disciples like Xie Bufan couldn’t help but feel a faint sense of suppression.

They felt as though their souls were about to be sundered by the scary blade qi around them.

Everyone swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

That was definitely a dao artifact!

“That’s right. This is the Fiend Moon Blade. It’s a dao artifact, and I have nurtured it for countless years. I only managed to craft this after several billion years of hard work.” Qiao Jinyang didn’t plan on hiding the origins of the weapon.

Indeed. It was what they thought it was!

Xie Bufan and the others felt their hearts pounding.

“Bufan…,” Qiao Jinyang called for him.

“Disciple is present!” Xie Bufan acknowledged, and he got to his knees.

“I shall bestow upon you the Fiend Moon Blade. When you enter the Cangqiong Holy Manor, use it to kill him! I have already sealed a hundred different grand dao laws in the weapon and it will be more than enough to destroy Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul!” Qiao Jinyang paused for a second and continued, “A hundred grand dao laws should be enough to kill him a hundred times over!”

Everyone didn’t dare to believe their ears.

A hundred strands of grand dao laws!

One had to know that a single strand of grand dao law was extremely precious to a Primal Ancestor! Every time they lost one, they needed to cultivate for a long time to get it back. In order to kill Huang Xiaolong, Qiao Jinyang was willing to part with a hundred strands of grand dao laws! His desire to kill Huang Xiaolong could not be stronger.

With a gentle push, the Fiend Moon Blade drifted towards Xie Bufan.

After receiving it with both his hands, Xie Bufan fell to his knees. “Master, please rest assured that I will slay Huang Xiaolong with this blade! He will not leave the Cangqiong Holy Manor alive!”

Qiao Jinyang nodded slowly. With the assistance of the Fiend Moon Blade, Xie Bufan could kill Huang Xiaolong undoubtedly!

“In case of any troubles, you should work together with Li Chen of the Holy Heavens. If you join hands, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to run even if he were to grow a pair of wings during the battle!” Gu Tianmei added.

“Work together with Li Chen?!” Xie Bufan frowned. It was evident that he wasn’t willing to do so. Moreover, he felt that Li Chen would be of no use. With his strength and the Fiend Moon Blade, he was more than confident of killing Huang Xiaolong!

Cao Nan nodded. “That’s right. Even if you have the Fiend Moon Blade, the four Primal Ancestors from the Holy Heavens would definitely give the brat some defensive artifacts. As long as you work with Li Chen, you will be able to kill Huang Xiaolong inside the manor. Since the trial, Li Chen’s desire to kill Huang Xiaolong has never been stronger. He will be more than willing to work with you to kill Huang Xiaolong!”

Qiao Jinyang snorted, “Li Chen isn’t a simple character. You have to look for an opportunity to kill him off along with Huang Xiaolong during the battle…”

Kill them both!

Xie Bufan sucked a cold breath, and he bowed, “Disciple receives the order! I shall succeed at all costs!”

…

The opening of the Cangqiong Holy Manor approached, and the various superpowers whose disciples had passed the trial were getting ready for the upcoming battle.

The reason everyone had risked their lives to kill Ghost Devils in the Ghost Devil City during the Trial of Blood was so that they could get the opportunity to enter the Cangqiong Holy Manor! There were origin pills, holy herbs, holy martial arts, and even peak level holy skills hidden in the manor! The Cangqiong Blade, a Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact, was also in the manor! Not to mention, the Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance and the Cangqiong Seed…

Every power was giving their all in order to fight for better treasures in the manor.

Another month passed in a flash.

The Holy Heavens failed to locate Huang Xiaolong, and as the four Primal Ancestors were about to blow, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes in the All Extinguishing Holy Grounds. He had finally completed his transition to the Fifth Tribulation Half Saint Realm.

After standing up, Huang Xiaolong exhaled a long breath. After absorbing all the energy, his holy souls and Dao Heart had experienced an earth shaking change.

“Your Highness!” Di Huai and the others rushed over instantly.

“Your Highness, you’re finally awake!” Di Huai laughed. Previously, they were panicking when they saw that Huang Xiaolong was still digesting the energy contained in the tribulation.

Huang Xiaolong nodded as a smile broke out on his face. “My estimations were a little off. I didn’t think that I would take such a long time to enter the Fifth Tribulation Half Saint Realm.” He had nearly missed the opening of the Cangqiong Holy Manor! Luckily for him, he would be able to make it if he rushed back immediately.

Upon retrieving his transmission symbol, Huang Xiaolong saw the horrifying amount of messages requesting for him to return to the organization.

“Let’s go. We’re returning to the Holy Heavens!” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on lazing around. Upon summoning the Winged Dragon Flying Ship, they charged straight back to the organization.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong replied to all four Primal Ancestors and Grand Hall Master Wu Ge.

When they received his reply, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

Ten days later, Huang Xiaolong arrived in the space above the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds. He left straight for the Primal Ancestors’ space, and Huang Xiaolong left only after half a day. No one knew what happened inside the Primal Ancestors’ space…

This time, Tyrant Chu took the lead once again as he led Huang Xiaolong, Li Chen, and those who qualified towards the Cangqiong Holy Grounds.

It took them two months to arrive.
