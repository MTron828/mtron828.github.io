Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was extremely satisfied looking at Huang Xiaolong’s shocked face, chuckling as he said, “Frightened already? This innate spiritual embryo is a very rare existence, it’s hard to come across one in a million years, and it takes that long to nurture one. Legend has it that one galaxy will only be able to breed one in every million years!”

Huang Xiaolong’s widened eyes became even wider, “Meaning to say, this innate spiritual embryo in front of us is the only one in a million years? But this embryo has been nurtured here for close to one million years, why hasn’t anyone found it?”

Lastly, Huang Xiaolong spoke the doubt in his mind.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyilet out another complacent chuckle, “You think that such precious thing can be found by just anyone? Heaven-defying treasures such as this innate spiritual embryo, don’t even dream of it if you don’t have heaven-defying luck! This is because lady luck is smiling upon you!”

Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless, “Then, shall take this innate spiritual embryo away?”

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyinodded, “En, take it away now, I can sense that there’s someone coming closer to this planet, move quickly!”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised at the revelation. But he was well aware that Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s spiritual sense was many times more powerful than his, if the Old Dragon said that there was someone coming, it was a fact that there was someone coming.

Immediately, Huang Xiaolong moved to collect the innate spiritual embryo.

Initially, it would be difficult for Huang Xiaolong to take away the innate spiritual embryo, for its had formed its own awareness and intelligence, however, with Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s help, everything went smoothly.

With Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s assistance, It didn’t take Huang Xiaolong too much time to seal the innate spiritual embryo together with the rhombus jade stone column into the Godly Mt. Xumi, placing it at the center of the Ten Buddha Formation. They wanted to borrow the energy from the Ten Buddha Formation to suppress its resistance and continue nurturing the innate spiritual embryo.

When that was done, Huang Xiaolong looked at the walls around, there were pieces of green spirit stones attached to the surface of the walls. Many of those spirit stones were saint grade, some even reached divine grade.

Of course Huang Xiaolong would not waste such precious items that were just lying in front of him, moving quickly to collect them with care.

“Go!” Huang Xiaolong and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi flew out from deep underground to the airspace above the planet. Only at this moment did Huang Xiaolong’s spiritual sense feel someone moving in their direction at rapid speed.

There were six people in total.

The one leading the group was a young man of peak half-step God Realm cultivation, whereas the other five people were elders. All five were God Realm masters, but only First Order God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong was quick to conceal his aura and hid in a space pocket.

“Young Lord, was there really a treasure born here?” One of the five old men asked.

Jiang Shaoze nodded, “This is the result of my deduction from researching countless ancient records. It’s on this planet. This planet is dull and dim, basically one cannot tell that there is a planet here unless they are close enough,” he paused here before continuing, looking at the dark soil, “Not a breath of life can be felt from this planet, this is most likely the consequence of having all of its life energy swallowed by some innate treasure.”

The five old men exchanged some glances amongst themselves.

“Young Lord is able to find such an innate treasure, it will surely be able to assist Young Lord in advancing into the God Realm. In the Black Warrior Institute disciple selection, Young Lord can absolutely snatch the first place!”

Jiang Shaoze said, “At first, I wasn’t so confident in getting the first place, but now, I have full confidence that I will be able to defeat Gudu Leng, coming up above everyone else in this time’s Black Warrior Institute selection!”

A powerful aura surged out from the young man’s body. Above his head, one could actually see thunderclouds rumbling, taking many different shapes.

Huang Xiaolong fixed his gaze on that group of thunderclouds. He could tell that there’s something strange to this hovering thunderstorm, and at the same time, he wondered what kind of cultivation technique this young man practiced.

“This is the Jiang Family’s Grand Immortal Lightning Technique.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s voice sounded.

“The Jiang Family? This young man is a Jiang Family disciple?” Huang Xiaolong blinked twice.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi went on, “The Grand Immortal Lightning Technique is the Jiang Family’s supreme cultivation technique, possessing a terrifying destructive power. Only the core members of the Jiang Family are allowed to practice this technique. No doubt, this young man is a Jiang Family disciple, one with high status within the family at that. When one reaches a certain achievement in the technique, their internal body will generate this Grand Immortal Lightning. This young man is your top rival in the coming Black Warrior Institute selection.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement.

It was obvious that this Jiang Family young man was very strong despite the fact that the aura he projected belonged to a peak half-step God Realm. In fact, this young man was more powerful than the five old men behind him. Once this young man advanced into the God Realm, his strength would only be more terrifying.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t so perturbed by this Jiang Family young man. If this young man really did break through into the God Realm before the Black Warrior Institute selection deadline, Huang Xiaolong was still confident in defeating him with ease.

Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette moved, flying away from the dim planet.

“Once this Jiang Family disciple finds out that the innate spiritual embryo has already been taken away by someone else, he’ll surely go berserk.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi grinned wickedly.

“If you say it like this, it makes me feel abash.” Huang Xiaolong smiled sheepishly. The other party had searched through several years of ancient records and deductions before getting here, but he actually snatched it away by merely passing by. It gave the impression of reaping the fruits of other people’s toil.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi laughed, “Then why don’t you yield the innate spiritual embryo to that Jiang Family disciple?” Of course, it was meant as a joke.

Very soon, Huang Xiaolong was already far away from that planet, once again flying at breakneck speed, continuing his journey.

When Huang Xiaolong mentioned that he wanted to find a safe place to refine the innate spiritual embryo, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi disagreed, “No, if you refine this innate spiritual embryo now, your strength will undeniably soar, but you will only be able to reach peak half-step God Realm at most. Now, there’s only a fifty-fifty chance of breaking into the God Realm.”

“In my opinion, it would be best if you wait until you’re a peak half-step God realm before refining this innate spiritual embryo. At that time, not only can you step into the God Realm, there’s a high chance you can advance all the way to the late-First Order God Realm. This way, you would be able to use the embryo to its fullest potential.”

Huang Xiaolong was amazed, while Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi went on, “Peak half-step God Realm experts not only need to comprehend the time and space laws, when they are about to breakthrough they need an incredibly large amount of energy to support them, and the energy contained in this innate spiritual embryo can support you, supplying the energy needed for your breakthrough into the God Realm.”

Subsequently, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi explained to Huang Xiaolong the uses of an innate spiritual embryo. The uses of an innate spiritual embryo, bred and nurtured for a million years, we’re naturally not so simple. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Four months later, under Huang Xiaolong full speed flying effort, he finally reached the Central Starfield.

The Central Starfield itself was a vast collection of planets, belonging to many world surfaces. Following Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s instructions, Huang Xiaolong traveled in the direction of the Cloudsea Mainland at the center.

The Black Warrior Institute’s selection registration was held on this Cloudsea Mainland.

Another month passed when Huang Xiaolong finally arrived at the Cloudsea Mainland.

Surveying the environment around him, Huang Xiaolong noted that the pillows of clouds high above were actually baby blue in color. This surprised Huang Xiaolong, for these clouds were not formed from waters vapor, but formed from spiritual energy.

He felt the ground shake when his feet touched the ground. Lowering his head to check, he noticed that even the sand and dust on the ground contained noticeable amounts of spiritual energy. Each one of these grains gave Huang Xiaolong the same feeling as a low-level spirit pellet.

Mere dust and sand on the ground contained spiritual energy comparable to a low-grade spirit pellet, one could imagine how rich the spiritual energy on this Cloudsea Mainland was.

“This Cloudsea Mainland is, in fact, an entire world surface, ten thousand times bigger than the Martial Spirit World.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi added, “In the entire Cloudsea Mainland, there are ten thousand spiritual energy gathering formations. Numerous masters come together to lay out these formations during the desolate era. The Cloudsea Mainland is not only the Black Warrior Institute’s registration place, it is also the entire Black Tortoise Galaxy’s trading center. All super forces and big families in the Black Tortoise Galaxy have a storefront here on the Cloudsea Mainland.”
