Chapter 3417: Refining the Pangu Sword

 

“Dad, Mum.” A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. 

A sense of warmth filled his heart when he saw the members of the Huang Family once again.

“Little brat, you’re finally back! Don’t you know how much your mother misses you?! She’s been asking about you this whole time!” Huang Jiyuan chuckled.

Huang Xiaolong turned to his mother and said, “Mum, didn’t I say that I’ll be back before the new year? There’s three more months left!”

Initially, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t sure how long he would take to obtain the Pangu Sword. In fact, he estimated that he would need a lot longer than a month.

“Nonsense! You say that, but who knows if you’ll be back!” Wang Meilan grumbed. “What if you come back after another hundred years?!”

There was nothing else he could say in response, and he chose to keep silent. 

Amidst the laughter, they entered the main hall of the palace in the manor.

He asked about everything that happened in the month that he was gone, and it started a whole new argument. Everyone spoke about their experiences and the events that happened on Earth.

“Do you know that Lin Kai found a girlfriend?” Huang Wen laughed.

“Oh?!” Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the little brat.

Scratching his head in embarrassment, Lin Kai muttered, “We’ve only known each other for half a month… We haven’t even held hands! Uncle, you can’t believe everything my mother says!”

“Haha! There’s no need to act all flustered! Weren’t you praising her in front of us the whole time? Why don’t you tell your uncle what happened!” Huang Chenfei roared with laughter.

“Yeah! You should invite your girlfriend over and introduce her to the family now that Xiaolong is back.” Wang Meilan added.

Jumping in fright, Lin Kai shook his hands hurriedly. “There’s… There’s no need for that! She doesn’t know that Huang Xiaolong is my uncle, and I don’t wish to frighten her!” 

“Alright, alright. Isn’t there a villa in the Golden Lake District? You can bring her there if you don’t wish to show her the Blue Dragon Orchard.” Huang Xiaolong snickered.

Lin Kai opened his mouth, but he didn’t get to say anything before Huang Jiyuan changed the topic.

“Xiaolong, where’s the little black spirit you used to bring around?” 

Huang Xiaolong stared at his father in shock. When he realized that his father was referring to Liu Huang, the master of the Devil Prison, he chuckled to himself. “Oh! He went up to the Immortal World…”

Liu Huang was a disciple of the Shushan Immortal Gate, and Huang Xiaolong paid him a special visit before he returned to Earth.

When they heard that the little spirit had gone to the Immortal World, pouts formed on the faces of those present. “Why didn’t you tell us before he left? Oh… The spirit pets you gave us were really obedient. They are pretty smart too! When we were stuck, they could give us pointers!”

They quickly summoned the little black spirits.

Huang Xiaolong nearly laughed out loud. The little black spirits were eminent elders of the devil race he captured in the lower world, and all of them were old freaks who had lived for countless years. They were in the Void Immortal Realm, and it wasn’t surprising they knew more than Huang Jiyuan and the others.

…

Night quickly fell, and the banquet they hosted for Huang Xiaolong ended on a high note.

As the members of the Huang Family fell asleep, Huang Xiaolong hovered in the skies above the Blue Dragon Orchard. A sword appeared in his hands, and an azure light flowed about the surface of the blade. There was a strand of horrifying energy contained in the blade, and it was able to evade the sense of ordinary mortals. Only experts above the Heavenly Immortal Realm would be able to feel the difference!

That was the Pangu Sword!

Ever since Huang Xiaolong arrived in the Pangu World, he hadn’t seen anything as powerful as the Pangu Sword!

As his dao souls inspected every inch of the blade, he could feel the battle intent Pangu had when he crafted the sword. It was the first time Huang Xiaolong experienced such powerful battle intent. Just Pangu’s will alone could put existences like the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor to shame!

It was no wonder experts like the Heaven Piercing Sage didn’t try to use the Pangu Sword in the battle against the Heavenless Devil Ancestor.

He wouldn’t be able to use a fraction of its power, and he might be devoured by the battle intent left behind by Pangu!

Slowly sitting down, Huang Xiaolong started to refine the Pangu Sword. As he rushed all the way back, he hadn’t had time to refine the blade.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The night passed uneventfully, and Huang Xiaolong finally got to his feet when the first ray light hit the land.

After an entire night, Huang Xiaolong had gained an initial understanding of the battle intent left by Pangu.

He knew that he needed several more days in order to fully refine the Pangu Sword.

Of course, he wasn’t in a rush. He planned to accompany the members of the Huang Family, and he would head over to the Kunlun Secret Region after several days.

Wang Meilan and the others started their day, and she raised a question as soon as she walked into the courtyard. “Xiaolong, your dad and I had a discussion, and we plan on going to Hong Kong for a holiday.”

“Why the sudden decision?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Huang Jiyuan started to explain, “It’s not a sudden decision. Your mother’s family are still living in Hong Kong, and we plan to visit them. After all, we haven’t been there before. Your mother planned to go after the new year, but since you’re back, we should take the chance to go now!”

“What do you think of our plan?” Huang Jiyuan continued, “However, if you’re busy, we can always go after the new year.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “It’s fine! I have nothing on at the moment, and we should choose a day soon. I wish to stroll around Hong Kong too.”

In the past, Huang Xiaolong didn’t manage to go to Hong Kong. Now that he was back, he wanted to properly enjoy a tour of the big city.

He had always been attracted to Hong Kong as a child. After all, Hong Kong movies were his favorite.

Moreover, going to Hong Kong for a holiday wouldn’t affect his refinement of the Pangu Sword.

“Shall we take an afternoon flight? Wang Meilan grinned. “You should give a call to Yuhan and ask her to follow us.” She’s in the Zhang Family Manor now, and it wouldn’t take long for her to come over.”

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. It had been some time since he last saw her, and honestly, he missed her.

Zhang Yuhan replied almost instantly and said that she would be coming over soon.

Several hours later, she arrived. Staring at Huang Xiaolong with her loving eyes, she pouted, “When did you get back?”

“Late last night… It was late, and I didn’t want to disturb you.” A warm smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face and Zhang Yuhan giggled happily.

Jumping into Huang Xiaolong’s embrace, the two of them walked around the manor. As they hugged each other, Huang Xiaolong could hear her racing heartbeat.

An hour after she arrived, the members of the Huang Family got ready to leave.

A helpless smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he saw the countless chests his mother prepared.

“Why did you pack so many things again?!” Huang Chenfei was the first to grumble.

“We haven’t seen them in a long time! Why can’t I bring more stuff over for them?!” 

Huang Chenfei stared at her in stunned silence, and he knew that he would never be able to win his mother in a battle of words…
