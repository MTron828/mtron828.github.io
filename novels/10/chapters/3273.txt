Chapter 3274: Huang Sheng’an Has Broken Through to Enlightenment Realm?

“Oh, high-level Nascent Soul expert.” Sun Yao exclaimed in slight surprise.

Sun Cheng nodded, “Yes, Huang Xiaolong and Huang Houde were recognized as the Huang Family’s most talented younger generation at that time, but there were more than a few conflicts between them. Hence it is not strange since Huang Xiaolong came back and talked Huang Sheng’an into revolting.”

Sun Yao commented, “No wonder.” He chuckled. “Originally, Huang Family could add another powerful high-level Nascent Soul expert to their midst, raising their strength to another level, but this Huang Xiaolong turned around and pulled Huang Sheng’an, Huang Qi, and Huang Feiwu to his camp. He made the Huang Family fall into internal chaos, damaging their strengths instead. Really, the workings of fate!”

Sun Cheng chortled, “Old Ancestor is right. This is the Heavens helping our Sun Family to rise!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

While Sun Yao and Sun Cheng discussed the Huang Family’s rebellion, the Tan Family was concerned about the same issue. But the latest news came half a day later!

“Huang Houde’s detained by Huang Sheng’an! Grand Elder Huang Xin and Grand Elder Huang Wendan, the other five grand elders, and all Huang Family’s elders have all joined Huang Sheng’an, Huang Qi, and Huang Feiwu’s camp!”

When the news broke out, eyes dropped to the ground in shock.

When Sun Yao and Sun Cheng heard the news, they were just as flabbergasted.

Shouldn’t it be the other way around, Huang Houde captured Huang Sheng’an, Huang Qi, and Huang Feiwu? How come it was Huang Houde who was detained instead? On Huang Houde’s side were eight great Nascent Soul experts including himself, not to mention the several hundred Huang Family’s experts!

“Check, send people to check immediately what happened?!” Sun Yao ordered solemnly, “I want to know what happened at that time inside the Blue Dragon Orchard!”

Sun Cheng nodded solemnly as he understood the seriousness of this matter.

Things were really too strange.

Similar to the Sun Family, other Donglin Province’s big and small families’ forces all ordered the people to quickly find out what was going on.

An astounding piece of news circulated through Donglin Province early the next day that Huang Sheng’an broke through to the Enlightenment Realm!

He’s now an Enlightenment expert!

The news not only shocked the Donglin Province’s various forces, but also the neighboring provinces’ forces, and the whole Huaxiao Alliance authority. The emergence of any new Enlightenment Realm expert was categorized as a major event by the Huaxia Alliance.

“Impossible, Huang Sheng’an, he’s only a late-Seventh Level Nascent Soul Realm. How could he have advanced to the Enlightenment Realm overnight? Absolutely impossible!”

Though the news of Huang Sheng’an advancing to Enlightenment Realm broke out, astounding many other families’ patriarchs, these patriarchs also denied this possibility.

But another news soon drowned out these voices of denial as there were witnesses that saw Huang Sheng’an displaying the strength of an Enlightenment Realm expert! His nascent soul appeared out of his body!

As time passed, more and more experts witnessed it!

While Huaxia Alliance authority and other families were still in doubt, another shocking news spread.

“Huang Sheng’an abolished Huang Houde’s patriarch position, and took over as the new generation patriarch!

“Huang Houde’s line of descendents were all cleaned up by Huang Sheng’an, Huang Xin, Huang Qi, Huang Feiwu, and the remaining grand elders all turned to support Huang Sheng’an. Huang Chengyi, Huang Maosheng, and Huang Bingquan are missing, they must have been killed by Huang Sheng’an!”

These consecutive pieces of news rendered numerous Huaxia Alliance’s families agape.

Everything seemed to happen too fast for anyone to react.

“How could Huang Sheng’an advance to Enlightenment Realm?!” Sun Family’s Old Ancestor Sun Yao’s face was slightly distorted. “D*mn it!”

Originally, Huang Sheng’an’s revolt had caused members of Huang Family to kill each other, greatly damaging Huang Family’s strength. But now that Huang Sheng’an had broken through to Enlightenment Realm, it changed the whole game!

One Enlightenment Realm expert was more than enough to block ten Ninth Level Nascent Soul experts, maybe more than that!

The Huang Family’s strength had not been weakened, but it had grown stronger!

Sun Cheng’s face was just as bad. “Could it be that Huang Sheng’an concealed his strength all this time?”

Sun Yao nodded his head in agreement. “It must be so. Maybe Huang Sheng’an already broke through a month ago, and because of that he dared to revolt! That he dared to rob the Huang Family’s patriarch position!” He sighed, “We paid too little attention to Huang Sheng’an in the past!”

Sun Cheng spoke solemnly, “Although Huang Sheng’an has broken through to the Enlightenment Realm, he harmed Huang Houde’s line and several hundred of Huang Family’s disciples. When the Huang Family’s Old Ancestor Huang Ming learns of this matter, he would be furious, and he might not agree to let Huang Sheng’an to take over the patriarch position. When Huang Ming and Huang Sheng’an battle it out, and both suffer injuries, that would be great news to us!”

Sun Yao’s eyes lit up, and he let out a hearty laughter. “You are right, if Huang Sheng’an persuades Huang Ming to let him take over the patriarch position after advancing to Enlightenment Realm, that would be fine. However, Huang Sheng’an got that position through usurpation, and stepping on the bodies of Huang Houde’s line. Therefore, things are vastly different. Huang Ming would throw a fit! Who knows, maybe Huang Ming has already heard the news and is rushing back in raging anger from the East Sea!”

“Haha, we just need to wait for a good show!”

While the Sun Family, Tan Family, and various forces’ were paying attention to the changes in Huang Family, inside the Blue Dragon Orchard, Huang Sheng’an was kowtowing to Huang Xiaolong in gratitude. “I will faithfully serve Your Highness in the future, doing my utmost in everything, and I will not retreat in the face of death!”

A day before, Huang Sheng’an was indeed still a Seventh Level Nascent Soul Realm. It was Huang Xiaolong who had raised his cultivation realm overnight to Enlightenment Realm!

This feat was impossible for others but not for Huang Xiaolong.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong had used the spiritual vein under the Blue Dragon Orchard to temper Huang Sheng’an’s body, expelling the impurities in his body at a deeper level. This would greatly benefit Huang Sheng’an in his future cultivation, obtaining twice the result with half the effort.

Originally, Huang Xiaolong had wanted his father, Huang Jiyuan, to take over the Huang Family’s patriarch position, but Huang Jiyuan refused. Thus, Huang Xiaolong chose the next best option and pushed Huang Sheng’an up to the position.

Needless to say, Huang Sheng’an was the patriarch on the surface but all the decisions were under Huang Xiaolong’s control.

“Rise,” Huang Xiaolong had Huang Sheng’an stand up, and passed a cultivation to him. He also improved the current Huang Family’s main cultivation technique and handed it to Huang Sheng’an. He then had Huang Sheng’an display the technique and pointed out the places Huang Sheng’an was inaccurate.

“Your Highness, the old ancestor has learned what happened to Huang Houde and is rushing over from the East Sea in fury. He will probably reach Donglin Province the day after tomorrow.” Huang Sheng’an respectfully reported to Huang Xiaolong when they were on a break.

Huang Xiaolong grunted softly in response. Huang Ming had doted on Huang Houde all along, now that Huang Houde was captured, Huang Xin, Huang Wendan, and the others all chose to stand on Huang Sheng’an’s side, so it was granted that Huang Ming was furious.

“Huang Ming.” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered.

Huang Sheng’an subsequently reported on the various reactions of forces under the Huaxia Alliance, specifically mentioning the Sun Family swallowing the family’s industries in Yan City.

At the moment, their Huang Family’s business in Yan City had completely fallen into the Sun Family’s hands.

“Your Highness, it is said the Sun Family’s old ancestor broke through to the Enlightenment Realm a year ago.” Huang Sheng’an added, “This is what gave the Sun Family the guts to do this.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “I see. Then I shall make a visit to the Sun Family in Yan City tomorrow.”

He had to help his parents break through to Golden Core Realm.

His initial plan was to wait a few days after his parents’ cultivation realm had advanced, but the result of cultivating inside the Grand Complete Heaven Formation in the last few days were very good, and They had already stabilized their peak late-Ninth Foundation Building Realm.They could breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm on this day.
