Chapter 227: Searching for Godly Mt. Xumi

One after another, stately Buddha statues towered over heaven and earth, surpassing ten zhang! Reaching a hundred zhang! Several hundred zhang!

Looking in front of him, Huang Xiaolong actually couldn’t see an end to the Buddha statues even at the horizon line.

There were ten thousand Buddha statues on the Thousand Blessings Square, then inside the Buddha Cavern, how many Buddha statues were there? Hundreds of thousands? Perhaps even millions!

Huang Xiaolong was astounded to the core at this sight.

These Buddha statues were sculpted in a myriad of forms, each unbelievably life-like, as if each of these statues was solid, in their actual body on earth. Huang Xiaolong flew deeper into the cavern above these Buddha statues, using his Wings of Demon. In the beginning, Huang Xiaolong did not feel much, but as time wore on, his eyes started seeing double, his mind, his heart, every thought, and breath were influenced by these Buddha statues.

After not even an hour of flying, Huang Xiaolong actually felt so exhausted that he quickly stopped, landing on the shoulder of a huge Buddha statue and sat down in meditation.

Huang Xiaolong touched his forehead, finding that he was drenched in sweat and was taken aback! With his current Xiantian strength, not to mention flying for merely an hour or so, he could fly for a day and night and he wouldn’t feel tired, much less exhausted. But now, he was drenched in sweat!

This was highly unusual!

Slowly, Huang Xiaolong found out his exhaustion came from his spirit and not because his battle qi ran out. It was tiredness that stemmed from his spiritual sense, soul, and heart, moreover, the energy inside his body was chaotic. Taking a deep breath to calm himself, Huang Xiaolong ran the Body Metamorphose Scripture to adjust his condition, gradually soothing the chaos taking place inside his body.

It was several hours later when Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes again, calmed, but the tiredness lingered. Even more tiring than the time he fought Xie Puti in Duanren Empire’s Imperial City Battle for the championship!

Despite that, Huang Xiaolong pulled himself up and continued heading deeper into the cavern.

Another few hours later, he had to stop for a rest again to meditate, to calm the energy inside his body that had once again become chaotic.

Huang Xiaolong noticed something odd. After meditating, his soul and spiritual force were actually more fatigued than before.

Huang Xiaolong stood up and continued to venture deeper.

One day passed in the same manner.

At the end of the day, when Huang Xiaolong stopped to rest on the body of a Buddha statue, he was feeling dizzy, his breathing uneven. In fact, he was panting slightly. He hurried to meditate and swallow a medicinal pellet to recover.

But, swallowing medicinal pellets had no effect on the soul and spiritual force.

The medicinal pellets he had were also for recovering battle qi and internal force.

This time, he spent the entire night to smooth his internal chaotic energy. Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes after one night, even more exhausted than before, so much that he had no desire to move. Sleep, he only wanted to sleep. Huang Xiaolong badly wanted to close his eyes and sleep forever, not waking up.

“What is happening?!” Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness suddenly jerked up.

Buddha statues!

It was these Buddha statues!

Huang Xiaolong recalled and was shocked to find these root cause of his problem.

The bodies of these Buddha statues manifested an invisible spiritual pressure and it was exactly this invisible spiritual pressure that caused his soul and spiritual force to feel so exhausted.

Though he found the cause, Huang Xiaolong was frowning.

If he continued to venture deeper, his soul and spirit may not be able to withstand the invisible spiritual pressure manifested by these Buddha statues and crumble. At that time, he would end up a madman, for not even a Saint realm expert could cure a damaged spirit.

Huang Xiaolong checked the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, God Binding Ring and Absolute Soul Pearl in his body, all three Heavenly Treasures were quiet.

When Huang Xiaolong entered the Saint Pavilion in search of the Absolute Soul Pearl, there was still an occasional reaction from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and God Binding Ring, yet this time around, none of the three Heavenly Treasure inside his body showed any reaction.

“Was Zhao Shu’s conjecture erroneous?” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Zhao Shu made the conclusion based on the ancient Buddhist scripture he had gotten hold of. If Zhao Shu’s assumption was a mistake, then this trip to the Blessed Buddha Empire would be a trip made in vain.

Without the Godly Mt. Xumi, Huang Xiaolong’s plan of advancing to Xiantian Tenth Order in the span of six years was impossible. Forget about Xiantian Tenth Order, he would be far away from breaking into Xiantian Seventh Order.

At this point of time, Huang Xiaolong spread out his spiritual sense to his surroundings. As he was trying to get a feel of his surroundings, he noticed a mysterious energy current, extremely weak and barely perceptible if one didn’t pay attention, flowing in the Buddha Cavern. If it wasn’t for Huang Xiaolong carefully spreading out his spiritual sense, it would have gone unnoticed.

This mysterious energy was similar to the Buddhism power from the Blessed Buddha Altar, yet different at the same time.

Huang Xiaolong tried to lead this mysterious energy into his body, slowly refining it and was surprised to find the exhaustion in his soul and spirit recover significantly.

This result delighted him!

If this was so, he needn’t worry about damaging his soul and spirit upon entering deeper into the cavern.

After Huang Xiaolong absorbed and refined the mysterious energy, the exhaustion he felt in his soul and spirit recovered as if they were being nurtured, very close to returning to their peak form.

Huang Xiaolong would then stand up and continue flying deeper into the Buddha Cavern.

Just like this, ten days passed, rest and continue, rest and continue.

Ten days passed, yet the Heavenly Treasures bore no reaction at all.

And Huang Xiaolong was surprised to find in the last ten days that the mysterious energy in the Buddha Cavern helped his soul and spiritual force grow stronger, going as far as enhancing his battle qi and internal force.

This speed was much faster than practicing in the ancient battlefield while swallowing Fire Dragon Pearls, however, Huang Xiaolong was unable to feel joy at his improved strength. Instead, his heart grew heavierㅡbecause there was still no reaction at all from the three Heavenly Treasures!

In the last ten days, all his eyes could see was an endless sea of Buddha statues, and only Buddha statues.

Zhao Shu had never been inside the Buddha Cavern, thus before coming in, Huang Xiaolong had no idea how the Blessed Buddha Empire’s forbidden land looked like. Now he knew.

Though the chance seemed slimmer by the day, Huang Xiaolong was unwilling to leave the Buddha Cavern just like this. The good thing was, there was no time limit for his stay inside the Buddha Cavern, such as one month’s time with the Saint Pavilion. He could stay as long as he wanted.

Cultivating in the Buddha Cavern was beneficial too, hence, Huang Xiaolong remained, journeying deeper every day.

While Huang Xiaolong journeyed deeper every day, in a certain space pocket within the Buddha Cavern, Old Law and seven other guardians were observing Huang Xiaolong’s movements.

“It’s been ten days already, I did not expect this kid could remain inside for so long, even going deeper into the cavern!

“Last time when Fan Chen, that lad, came inside, how long did he stay? If I remember correctly, it should be fifteen days, I wonder if this kid can surpass that!

“He can actually refine the Buddhism spiritual energy inside the Buddha Cavern!”

Several people talked at the same time.

A light flickered in Old Law’s eyes as he quietly observed Huang Xiaolong’s flying silhouette inside the Buddha Cavern’s space.

“This kid looks like he’s searching for something inside the Buddha Cavern?” One of the eight suddenly said.

“Searching for something?” Old Law pondered the words.

Another ten days passed the same way.

Twenty days after Huang Xiaolong entered, the three Heavenly Treasures inside his body remained quiet. But Huang Xiaolong had a harvest of a different kind. After seeing nothing but Buddha statues for twenty days, he was inspired and created a battle skill called Earthen Buddha Palm.

Flying past the numerous Buddha statues as he continued to the inner part of the Buddha Cavern, Huang Xiaolong practiced his self-created Earthen Buddha Palm. There was... only a single move to the Earthen Buddha Palm, however, similar to the hundreds and thousands of Buddha statues in the Buddha Cavern, it had just as many forms.

“This kid still has the leisure to practice battle skill inside the Buddha Cavern? And that, what kind of palm is that? It looks like one of our Buddhism battle skills, but very strange, I’ve never seen anything like it!”

The eight kasaya robed monks observed Huang Xiaolong who was practicing his Earthen Buddha Palm closely, discussing amongst themselves.

“He probably created this battle skill himself.” Old Law’s eyes never left Huang Xiaolong as he spoke those words with a somber voice.
