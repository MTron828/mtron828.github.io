Chapter 2839: Clandestine Pavilion

Speaking of the Dragon Fish Creed, Long Jianfei was rather emotional and proud.

Every inner disciple who belonged to a top-tier Creed like the Dragon Fish Creed would be proud of their own power.

Of course, Long Jianfei wasn’t a mere inner disciple. With his cultivation realm, he was a high-ranking personnel in the Dragon Fish Creed. His master was a vice hall master in the faction.

Since his master was a vice hall master, he knew many things ordinary inner disciples did not know.

For instance, the grand dao law and the forbidden arts in the Dragon Fish Creed library, the forbidden grounds in the Creed, and other dangerous regions.

In addition, he also knew the identities of the Dao Venerables in the Dragon Fish Creed. He knew how strong they were, and the grand dao art they used. He knew about their weapons, and the ability of those artifacts.

Long Jianfei listed them out one by one.

“The Dragon Fish Creed has thirty-six halls and close to a hundred Dao Venerable Realm experts?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock after hearing Long Jianfei’s introduction.

He knew that there might be a lot of Dao Venerables in the Creeds, but he hadn’t expected there to be a hundred of them.

Long Jianfei nodded. “Yes, Your Highness, thirty-six halls. The hall master and vice hall masters of each hall are Dao Venerable Realm experts. The old ancestor of the Dragon Fish Creed is a peak-level Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, and there are tons of experts stationed all around.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Actually, Long Jianfei was clueless on the exact number of the Dao Venerables in the Creed. He could only give Huang Xiaolong an estimated figure.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes twinkled. Could this be the strength of the strongest Creed in the Divine Tuo Holy World?

“So, your Divination Creed has close to a hundred Dao Venerable Realm experts as well?” Huang Xiaolong asked Duan Feng.

Duan Feng nodded respectfully, “That seems right. Then again, I have no idea how many Dao Venerables there actually are.”

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. It seemed as though he was too careless.

There were about twenty creeds like the Dragon Fish Creed and the Divination Creed in the Divine Tuo Holy World. There were countless mid-level Creeds like the Blue Heaven Creed, and one could only imagine the number of Dao Venerables in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sparkled with joy.

It seemed that he had to break through to the Dao Venerable Realm as soon as possible.

He might be able to sweep away weaker creeds like the Blue Heaven Creed, but he was nothing compared to the strongest powers!

If he were to disregard his combat abilities, a Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor would only be a tiny ant in the Divine Tuo Holy World!

After Long Jianfei and Duan Feng told him everything they knew, Long Jianfei hesitated for a while before asking, “Your Highness, why are you going to the Dragon Fish Creed?”

Huang Xiaolong had told them his intention to head over there, but he had omitted to tell them the reason behind it.

“I’m searching for something,” he replied.

The Huang Long Armor was a creation artifact, and it would mean that his identity as the Son of Creation would be revealed. He didn’t tell them the specifics as the implications would be too heavy for anyone to bear!

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng exchanged glances. They had assumed that Huang Xiaolong wanted to join the Dragon Fish Creed, but it didn’t seem to be the case. Whatever it was, the Dragon Fish Creed only accepted one batch of disciples every ten thousand years. Their selection process was extremely strict.

“So that’s it… I thought that you would want to join the Dragon Fish Creed.” Long Jianfei smiled.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Not really…”

Though he could draw support from the resources of the Dragon Fish Creed, there were lots of restrictions. He was sick of the infighting between the disciples.

Besides, only grand dao pills and dao origin-level treasures were useful to Huang Xiaolong now.

Even if he joined the Dragon Fish Creed and appeared as the Son of Creation, the Dragon Fish Creed would never allow him to devour the Dragon Fish Dao Origin. As for grand dao pills, Huang Xiaolong had a ton of them. If he needed more, he would be able to obtain them without joining the Dragon Fish Creed.

According to what Long Jianfei said, there were several super commercial houses selling grand dao pills in the Divine Tuo Holy World. As long as he had enough dao coins, he would be able to buy any number of them!

He had already plundered the treasury of the Blue Heaven Creed, and he had more than enough dao coins for the time being.

“Which is the strongest creed in the Divine Tuo Holy World?” Huang Xiaolong asked suddenly.

Both of them were taken aback.

“Your Highness, the strongest power in the Divine Tuo Holy World isn’t a creed” Long Jianfei muttered.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. Was there another power stronger than a Creed?!

“It’s a power called the Clandestine Pavilion.” Duan Fei answered.

“Clandestine Pavilion!” Huang Xiaolong was astounded.

“This Pavilion Master of the Clandestine Pavilion is ranked the strongest in the Divine Tuo Holy World. He’s extremely strong, and no one can guess the power of the Clandestine Pavilion. Their power can be found in most regions, and in various other holy worlds. No one knows how many branches they have, and the number of Dao Venerables is kept a secret!”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised, “The Clandestine Pavilion has countless branches in the various holy worlds?!”

The powers of the Dragon Fish Creed and Divination Ancestor Creed were only limited to the Divine Tuo Holy World. However, the Clandestine Pavilion’s power seemed to extend across worlds!

“Yes, some say that the branches can be found in more than a hundred holy worlds. There are rumors that they stretch even further than that, but no one is able to confirm the speculations.” Duan Feng shook his head and sighed.

Huang Xiaolong pondered.

The Clandestine Pavilion seemed to be an extremely strong power.

“Was their pavilion master born during the creation of the world?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng shook their heads, “No idea. There are some who say that he’s the strongest expert born during the creation of the world, but there are also some who say that he’s not from the Huang Long World.”

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock, “Not from the Huang Long World?”

If he wasn't from the Huang Long World, the identity of the pavilion master would be terrifying!

That was because he wouldn’t be bound by the laws of the Huang Long World.

In actual fact, Huang Xiaolong was not a member of the Huang Long World either. He was from the Pangu World, and he wasn’t restricted by the laws of the Huang Long World. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to possess twelve high-order Saint Fates and a small world in the Primal Ancestor Realm!

In the Huang Long World, everything that was impossible was possible to Huang Xiaolong.

“Yes, someone said that the Pavilion Master of the Clandestine Pavilion might have come from the Pangu World. Despite the rumors, no one is sure of anything.” Long Jianfei shook his head.
