Chapter 2210: People From the Black Devil Sect?

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong left the library and returned to the Elegant Courtyard.

He sat on the bed and started to plan out his next moves.

From the books inside the library, he learned that every ten of thousands of years, the three supreme sects, the Big Dipper Sword Sect, Incineration Valley, and the Nine Heavens Gate would open up their doors to recruit new disciples.

Based on his calculations, the Big Dipper Sword Sect would start recruiting disciples in half a year. Even though they only accepted a hundred disciples each time, Huang Xiaolong was confident that no matter how strict their criteria were, there was no problem in him passing their test.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s ambition didn’t stop there.

Even though the Big Dipper Sword Sect was a supreme sect that held unparalleled authority in the Falling Jade Dynasty, it was nothing more than a speck of dust in the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent. There were countless sects with more power than the Big Dipper Sword Sect in the vast lands.

It went without saying that Huang Xiaolong’s goal was to enter the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate!

As long as he entered the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate, he would be hailed as their young master!

With his identity, it would be much easier for him to move about in the Zhuoyuan Holy Lands.

Even though the requirements of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate were stricter than the Big Dipper Sword Sect, Huang Xiaolong believed that with three complete dao saint godheads, three saint bloodlines, and his saint physique, he would be more than qualified to enter the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate!

With the resources of the faction, Huang Xiaolong knew that it wouldn’t take long for him to enter the Venerable Realm!

When all was said and done, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t wait to enter the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate With the memories of the ex-patriarch of the faction, he knew quite a lot of their secrets!

He had also learned that Wan Zhuoyuan had left a ton of treasures and priceless spiritual pills in the treasury! With the help of all the treasures Wan Zhuoyuan had left behind, there was no doubt Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation would soar!

Before he could even think of entering the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate, Huang Xiaolong had to work hard to raise his strength to the best of his abilities.

Jinyuan Kingdom was nowhere near the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate and if Huang Xiaolong wanted to head there, he would need to cross more than half of the holy lands. Along the way, he would meet with a ton of dangers. Without recovering a certain amount of strength, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to dream of entering the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

With the plan formed, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered about anything else as he started to circulate his Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

Three complete dao saint godheads started to spin as strands of holy spiritual qi descended from the void and streamed into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Grandmist qi started to leak out from his body as tiny purple grandmist dragons started to revolve around his body.

After looking at the grandmist dragons around him, Huang Xiaolong realized that they were extremely thin. They were as thin as a newborn’s thumb!

As strands of holy spiritual qi charged into Huang Xiaolong’s body, his internal organs started to heal. The meridians that were torn to shreds started to reattach themselves.

The bloody scars on his face started to disappear.

Huang Xiaolong cultivated through the night and he only stopped when he felt the first rays of sunlight falling on his body.

He recovered quite a bit after a single night of cultivation.

Huang Xiaolong touched his face and noticed the traces of a few small scars that were still present. He wasn’t worried in the slightest as he knew that they would disappear in a day or two.

When Huang Xiaolong paused his cultivation session, Zhang Haochen was welcoming his friend, Young General Chen Wei, at the entrance of the manor. He quickly led Chen Wei over to the Wind Mist Courtyard.

Upon seeing that he was brought to the Wind Mist Courtyard rather than the Elegant Courtyard, Chen Wei felt that things were a little strange. “Brother Haochen, do you have a guest in the Elegant Courtyard right now?”

Zhang Haochen hesitated for a moment before he explained everything he knew about Huang Xiaolong.

“Oh, his identity is unknown, and when you guys saved him, his meridians and spirit sea was damaged? He managed to injure a late-Third Order God King several days later?! That’s strange...” Chen Wei muttered to himself.

Zhang Haochen nodded, “It’s strange indeed. I tried to investigate his identity during the past few days, but to no avail!”

Chen Wei’s expression changed. It seemed as though he had figured something out as he exclaimed in surprise, “Could he be from the Black Devil Sect?!”

“What?! Black Devil Sect?!” Zhang Haochen’s expression changed drastically.

The Black Devil Sect was one of the biggest evil forces in the Jinyuan Kingdom. It was also the number one target of the kingdom! As the largest demonic force, it had roots and branches everywhere, making it almost impossible for anyone to eliminate them.

Not a single person could remain calm when the Black Devil Sect was mentioned. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Chen Wei nodded his head, “It’s not impossible. For the past few years, experts in the Black Devil Sect had pretended to be severely injured before infiltrating the various races and noble households in the Jinyuan Kingdom! If he really is from the Black Devil Sect, Brother Haochen has to be very careful! The Prince Qian Manor might even be dragged into the storm!”

“I have heard that Prince Long has been instigating His Majesty recently. He told His Majesty that your Prince Qian Manor is colluding with the Black Devil Sect and has an intention to rebel. His Majesty’s trust is swaying!”

Zhang Haochen’s expression sank.

“Brother Chen Wei, are you saying...?”

Chen Wei muttered, “I think it’s best for you to send some people to capture him. Torture him until he admits that he’s from the Black Devil Sect. If he really isn’t from the Black Devil Sect, there is nothing to worry about. If he is, you can capture him and bring him to His Majesty to show off your loyalty to the kingdom!”

Zhang Haochen’s eyes lit up and he nodded in agreement, “Brother Chen Wei is right. This matter is of utmost priority. He came from a questionable origin and we can’t allow him to stay here any longer. From the strength he displayed, he should be in the Heavenly Monarch Realm. It won’t be easy for us to capture him successfully.”

“Just report this matter to your father! He can easily invite several distinguished masters to capture that kid!”

A brilliant light flashed through Zhang Haochen’s eyes. It was true that the esteemed masters would have to respect his father’s orders.

“But... What about my sister?” Zhang Haochen realized that there was another factor, and he hesitated for a moment.

“If your father personally gives the order, your sister won’t be able to stop him! It’s even possible that your sister has fallen into the hands of the other party! I’ve heard that the Black Devil Sect has managed to develop a sinister technique that allows them to control someone in the dark! The victim won’t show any signs of being controlled on the outside!” Chen Wei continued, “If your sister has really fallen to his spell, you will save the entire Prince Qian Manor by exposing him!

Zhang Haochen leaped to his feet, “Brother Chen Wei, take a break here while I look for my father!”

“Okay!”

Zhang Haochen didn’t waste a single second, and he ran all the way over to report the matter to his father.

Prince Qian nodded his head and praised his son, “You did a good job noticing this issue. It is indeed true that something is off about this person. He managed to injure Housekeeper Wang even with shattered meridians and a broken spirit sea. This matter is too suspicious! Pass down my order! Summon several esteemed masters and call for all the guards to head over to the Elegant Courtyard!”
