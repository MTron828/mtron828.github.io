Chapter 3225: Opening of the World of Departed Souls

Even if Huang Shengdao had a ton of Dao Emperor Pill to supplement his cultivation, he wouldn’t be able to surpass Huang Xiaolong’s strength!

A million years ago, both Huang Shengdao and Fu Luosen only had several hundred thousand to a million units of grand cosmos energy. According to the speed of his progression, he would probably possess two to three million at best!

Compared to Huang Xiaolong’s thirty million, the gap between the two wasn’t merely large!

A strange feeling formed in the old dragon’s heart. In fact, he started to pity the two of them. He wondered what would happen if they ran into Huang Xiaolong during their trip to the World of Departed Souls.

Shaking his head, he couldn’t bear to think about what would happen.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong cleared up some questions about cultivation with the old dragon before telling him about his intentions to visit the members of the Huang Family.

Nodding slightly, the old dragon chuckled, “Do you need me to go with you?”

With his eyes widening in shock, Huang Xiaolong laughed, “If you have nothing else to do, sure.”

“Alright! In a few days, we shall set off!”

Setting the date of departure to be four days later, the old dragon left Huang Xiaolong to his own devices.

When he was sure the old dragon was gone, Huang Xiaolong started to observe the four Origin Divine Fires in his body.

The divine fires resided in his heart, lung, liver, and kidney, and they seemed to form a system of their own.

The Vermillion Bird Divine Fire was located in his heart, the White Tiger Divine Fire was located in his lungs. The Azure Dragon Divine Fire was burning brightly in his liver while the Black Tortoise Divine Fire glimmered in his kidneys.

The four Origin Divine Fires were terrifying as they continued to devour universe origin energy regardless of what Huang Xiaolong was doing.

Every time they flickered, universe origin energy would pour into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Ever since Huang Xiaolong reached perfection level in all thirteen elements, the four Origin Divine Fires seemed to have awakened in him.

They were also the reason he managed to reach the grand perfection level and form so many units of grand cosmos energy!

Now, he could control the four Origin Divine Fires however he liked!

With the assistance of the four Origin Divine Fires, Huang Xiaolong was confident of taking anything on!

In the past, the old dragon was confident that he could reach the grand perfection level in the God of Creation Realm in the next billion years. Now, Huang Xiaolong was sure he wouldn’t even take a hundred million years to do so.

He could tell that his cultivation speed was terrifying beyond belief. If he managed to obtain the Pangu Axe and receive the Pangu World Creation Art, his strength would take another leap forward!

Four days later…

Huang Xiaolong met up with the old dragon as they returned to the Heavenly Sword Holy World.

When Huang Xiaolong left for the Blazing Dragon World from the Heavenly Sword Holy World, he took over four years of time! Now, it would take him less than ten days to get back!

Moreover, the ten days included the time they took to stroll about everywhere they pleased.

By the time they returned to the Star Gathering City, there was visible joy on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Big Brother!” When he appeared in the Huang Family Manor, the first person who discovered him was his younger brother, Huang Xiaohai!

Huang Xiaohai was shocked as he leaped at Huang Xaiolong.

Snickering slightly, Huang Xiaolong clapped his shoulders.

When the others heard Huang Xiaohai’s yell. They swarmed over in an instant. Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Min, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, Bei Xiaomei, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, Lin Xiaoying, Fei Yanzi, Feng Yue, Yin Yue, the little cow, the Grandmist Old Man, and the others charged out from the manor.

“Xiaolong!”

“Big Brother!”

They yelled in joy. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When the old dragon saw the number of ladies that poured out of the manor, he shook his head and chuckled under his breath. It seemed as though his disciple was someone who got pretty lucky in terms of his love life…

After chatting a little with the members of the Huang Family, Huang Xiaolong introduced the old dragon to them. “This is my master, and he’s the Blazing Dragon.”

Initially, none of them cared much. However, Cang Xun, the leader of the ten overlords, yelped in shock. “Blazing Dragon?! The God of Creation, Lord Blazing Dragon?!”

God of Creation!

The hearts of everyone present skipped a beat as they turned to look at Huang Xiaolong for confirmation.

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “That’s right. My master is the God of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World.”

Falling to their knees instantly, everyone greeted the old dragon. Huang Xiaolong knew that the image of the Blazing Dragon in their hearts was too great. After all, he was the oldest existence in the universe!

Seeing how they were kneeling before him, the old dragon helped all of them up. “Xiaolong is my dear disciple. There is no need for formalities between us.”

“This... “ Huang Peng countered in haste.

The old dragon shot a glare at Huang Xiaolong and Huang Xiaolong instantly understood the old dragon’s meaning. He said in response, “Father, all of you can just listen to what he says.”

Eventually, they decided to listen to Huang Xiaolong.

Naturally, the return of Huang Xiaolong along with his master, the God of Creation, was something worthy of celebration!

That very night, the Huang Family held a banquet to welcome the two of them.

During the banquet, Huang Peng gave up his seat to the old dragon. Realizing that there was no stopping them, the old dragon accepted and he enjoyed the festivities with the entire Huang Family.

He hadn’t been able to enjoy himself in a long time, and his hearty laughter filled the hall.

In the days that followed, the old dragon taught Huang Xiaolong while giving several pointers to the members of the Huang Family.

In the million years that Huang Xiaolong was gone, all the members of the Huang Family managed to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm. Even the little cow, the Grandmist Old Man, and the others.

Naturally, all of them were able to break through with the help of Huang Xiaolong’s Huang Long Bloodline. He assisted all of them in the past, and their path to the Primal Ancestor Realm was smooth sailing.

Seeing as everyone had already entered the Primal Ancestor Realm, Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of assurance in his heart. Even though a Primal Ancestor was nothing in the grand scheme of things, the Huang Family would possess a fighting chance when matched up against weaker enemies. Of course, the stronger they were, the better.

The reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s return was exactly that. He planned to train them a little more, and he wanted to use his grand cosmos energy to temper their bodies like what the old dragon had done for him.

Realizing what his disciple planned to do, the old dragon cautioned, “Xiaolong, I know that you have their interests at heart. However, this will severely affect your cultivation level.”

It was the truth.

If Huang Xiaolong used a million units of grand cosmos energy to refine their bodies, it would take him a lot of time to return to his peak.

“Master, I know what I’m doing.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

To Huang Xiaolong, a million units was nothing special. He would definitely be able to recover before the opening of the World of Departed Souls.

Nodding slightly, the old dragon decided to trust that his disciple knew what he was doing.

As time flowed on, over nine hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.

Bidding farewell to the members of the Huang Family, he left for the World of Departed Souls with the old dragon.

As the Soul Burying Silver River was pretty close to the Blazing Dragon World, the two of them weren’t in a rush. They took their time to head over, and when there were only several days left until the opening of the World of Departed Souls, they arrived.
