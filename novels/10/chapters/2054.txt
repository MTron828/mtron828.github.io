Chapter 2055: Wiping Out the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe Headquarters

While Huang Xiaolong maneuvered the Ancient Heavenly Court towards the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe headquarters was in a bustling of activities. More accurately, the whole headquarters was in a panicky mess.

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang was barking out orders to the tribe’s experts to move the tribe’s valuables to safety.

Now that the Radiance Divine City had fallen, his situation was similar to Di Jun. He was preparing to withdraw from Hell Spirits World.

Standing beside Shi Wushuang was the Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu, as well as the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s many Emperor Realm Ancestors.

“Brother Wushuang, even if that Huang Xiaolong would bring an army to the Spirits World, it would take him ten days to half a month to reach here. We don’t need to worry too much.” Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu spoke.

“That’s right, Patriarch. We only need a day to clear out all the treasures from the treasury, and we could evacuate within ten days. By the time Huang Xiaolong gets here, he won’t catch up to us even with the Ancient Heavenly Court’s speed.” The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor Shi Leng stated.

Another Ancestor smirked as he chimed in, “Say, when Huang Xiaolong gets here and sees an empty Nine Yin Treasury, what expression would he show? Probably, he will be angered to death, eh?”

His words brought laughter to the tense atmosphere.

Shi Wushuang sighed, “Who knew in the last crucial moments, Huang Xiaolong would rush back in the Ancient Heavenly Court into the battlefield, bringing the Azure Cow Ancestor, King of Darkness, and Six Winged Green Mosquito Race’s Old Ancestor Du Hai.”

Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu fumed, “In the past, the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race’s Old Ancestor Du Hai was once injured by the Radiance Ancestor, and he had nearly died at the Radiance Ancestor’s hands. Du Hai and the Radiance World should be fighting to the death. Instead of that, that Du Hai actually went to help Huang Xiaolong!”

Shi Wushuang issued a cold sneer, “It all boils down to benefits. Huang Xiaolong must have given Du Hai enough benefits. Then again, it’s not possible to tempt Du Hai if there aren’t several billions of low-grade chaos spirit stones.”

“Huang Xiaolong... how does he have so many low-grade chaos spirit stones?!” One of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors voiced his doubt with a frown.

Right at this time, an indifferent voice sounded in their ears, “Are you curious why I have so many low-grade chaos spirit stones?”

The voice was too abrupt, catching the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts by surprise. Shi Wushuang and Feng Chu reacted first because both of them were familiar with this voice, very familiar.

As expected, while Shi Wushuang and Feng Chu’s faces tightened nervously, that never-ending nightmare of a person appeared in their sight.

Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong leisurely approached them on the little cow. Following behind him was the King of Darkness and the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race’s Old Ancestor Du Hai.

In this trip to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe headquarters, Huang Xiaolong had merely brought three people with him, the little cow, the King of Darkness, and Du Hai. Then again, these three people were all the help he needed.

“Huang, Huang Xiaolong!” The group of Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Emperor Realm Ancestors were so terrified that several of them stuttered their words.

How?How did Huang Xiaolong arrive so fast!??

Logically, even if Huang Xiaolong had the Ancient Heavenly Court, it should have taken him at least ten days to reach their headquarters from the Radiance World.

“Are you all finding it strange that I could come here so fast?” Seeing the shock-widened eyes on Shi Wushuang, Feng Chu, and the others, Huang Xiaolong voiced their doubts indifferently.

Shi Wushuang and Feng Chu opened their mouths but no words came out. It looked like neither of them knew what to say.

Huang Xiaolong scanned the surroundings, and his gaze stopped on the group of Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s disciples moving things out from the Nine Yin Treasury. Huang Xiaolong spoke as he looked at them, “Patriarch Shi Wushuang, it seems you are moving the treasures from the Nine Yin Treasury in a hurry. Where are you planning to go?”

Shi Wushuang and the rest of Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors gulped down their rising trepidation.

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t put yourself on a pedestal!” One of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors couldn’t help stepping out and chastizing Huang Xiaolong. “So what if you’ve unified the Radiance World? Wait till our Old Ancestor returns...”

But he didn’t have the opportunity to finish his words. Huang Xiaolong casually pointed a finger at him, and that Ancestor exploded to his death.

A mid-Tenth Order Emperor died with just a tap of a finger!

The rest of Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors paled at this sight.

“Activate the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array!”

“Fight to the death against Huang Xiaolong!” Suddenly, Shi Wushuang bellowed as if he had spiraled out of control.

Knowing very well there was no longer any hope of running, it was better to fight Huang Xiaolong to the death. Maybe, there was a slim chance of survival that way.

Shi Wushuang’s voice reverberated throughout the entire Nine Yin Mountain Range, immediately stirring the rich and abundant corpse qi that had been lingering in the mountain range throughout the year. The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array had been activated.

Watching Shi Wushuang activate the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array as he planned to ‘fight him to the death,’ Huang Xiaolong did not stop Shi Wushuang. As a matter of fact, he was looking forward to experiencing the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array’s power.

It took a few moments for the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array to be fully activated. Layers of violent corpse qi roiled, and the surrounding temperature fell sharply, freezing the land within a million li radius of the Nine Yin Mountain Range. All the trees and beasts were reduced to gray ice statues.

Boundless and overwhelming frigid cold qi flooded, drowning Huang Xiaolong’s group in its belly.

Huang Xiaolong’s sixteen radiance wings emerged from his back and spread out, exuding blinding sacred light that formed a protective barrier over them. As powerful as the frigid cold qi was, it was unable to penetrate the barrier even by half an inch.

The little cow snickered, “The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array is one of the grander formation arrays in the myriad worlds. However, its power depends on who is controlling it. Just this meager power is not enough to withstand the strength of my kick.”

“No need for you guys to interfere.” Huang Xiaolong spoke, stopping the little cow and the others from interfering. With that, he leaped into the air, holding the Radiance Divine Scepter in his hand, while the Heavenly Hall and Radiance Divine Seal appeared above his head.

The three great radiance divine artifacts emitted crepuscular rays of white sacred light, and the phantom of the Radiance Ancestor emerged. The Radiance Divine Scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand suddenly struck down, aimed at the Nine Yin Mountain Range. Simultaneously, the Radiance Ancestor’s phantom also struck towards the same spot with his palm.

Rumble!

One strike from Huang Xiaolong, and the violent roiling corpse qi and frigid cold qi scattered away. Sections of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array were destroyed.

Fierce tremors shook the entire Nine Yin Mountain Range. The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts within the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array were thrown out in various directions. They coughed up blood as they crashed to the ground. Even Shi Wushuang had blood trickling down the corner of his mouth as he suffered injury from Huang Xiaolong’s attack.

It was as the little cow had said, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array was powerful, but that depended on who was directing it. A Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array helmed by Shi Wushuang, Feng Chu, and the others could only withstand the attacks from a Sovereign of Chiyou’s level.

Not to mention, Huang Xiaolong was stronger than Chiyou. On top of that, his strength was amplified by the Radiance Divine Scepter and the other two great radiance divine artifacts. Hence, Huang Xiaolong’s attack was comparable to the full power attack of a late-First Order Sovereign. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Huang Xiaolong snickered icily, watching the swaying Nine Yin Mountain Range and raised the Radiance Divine Scepter once again. The three radiance divine artifacts burst out in brilliant light, and he struck down again, harder.

Bang! The swaying Nine Yin Giant Corpse Array burst like a bubble. This time, the experts inside were thrown further out, and right at this time, two figures whistled out from the array formation. Shi Wushuang and Feng Chu were planning to seize the chance and make a run for it.

But when the two of them appeared from the array formation, a little ax flew straight at them. Seeing this small ax, both Shi Wushuang and Feng Chu’s pupils dilated in fear. Before either of them could utter a sound, the small ax had already chopped through them, splitting both of their bodies into two halves.

Subsequently, the City of Eternity flew out, pressing Shi Wushuang and Feng Chu’s dismembered bodies deep into the mountain range. The land shook and mountains crumbled.

“Patriarch!” The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors cried out in sorrow.
