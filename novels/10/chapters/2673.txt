Chapter 2674: Huang Xiaolong, I Want You Dead!

Huang Xiaolong stood high in the air, and his three holy souls’ senses covered the Eight Claw Devil Race’s territory and a virtual map appeared in his mind. Every corner of the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race and all individuals within the territory were clearly displayed under Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Even the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s Old Ancestor Mo Jincheng, who was enjoying beautiful women’s services as he bathed, did not escape Huang Xiaolong’s detection!

Watching Mo Jincheng soaking in the spiritual hot spring with his eyes closed, enjoying the massages given by delicate maids’ hands, Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly and flew towards the Devil Eye City.

As Huang Xiaolong was flying towards the Devil Eye City, Mo Jincheng’s eyes suddenly flew open, and he looked around warily.

“Old Ancestor, what’s wrong?” The four maids were startled by Mo Jincheng’s abrupt action.

A split open on Mo Jincheng’s forehead as an evil-looking pupil appeared, glowing in devilish light. Nothing in the world could escape the detection of this eye.

He searched for a while but didn’t find anything strange, thus the eye on his forehead closed again. His vigilant expression relaxed again.

After seeing that Mo Jincheng had recovered, one of the maids leaned onto his body, breathing on him and speaking in a sultry voice, “Old Ancestor, what is it?”

That voice and that tone were a hundred percent enticing.

Mo Jincheng slapped her soft bottom, sending her flesh bouncing, and laughed, “It’s nothing, maybe my feeling was wrong, but it felt like someone was peeking at me.”

The maid giggled charmingly having her bottom patted, and leaned deeper into Mo Jincheng, “Old Ancestor, you’re so naughty! Old Ancestor is invincible, so who would dare to peek at you, ah? Wouldn’t it be like seeking death?”

“That’s right! Even the legendary Fang Ding was beaten scared by Old Ancestor. God knows where he is hiding for all these years as he hasn’t dared to come out,” another maid chimed in.

Hearing their words, Mo Jincheng laughed heartily, and pulled the four maids into his embrace, “I am going to show you how invincible your old ancestor is!”

In an instant, spring bloomed over the hotspring.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong was already standing in the air above Devil Eye City.

Although the Eight Claw Devil had tight-lid security, especially around the city where many restrictions blocked even a fly from flying into the city undetected, these were useless to stop Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong sneered as he watched Mo Jincheng and the four maids’ burning passion in the hotspring. Frankly, a Primal Ancestor expert too had worldly desires. In the long road of cultivation, there were times when a Primal Ancestor would forget things and dive into mortal pleasures, so Huang Xiaolong wasn’t really surprised by the scene.

Huagn Xiaolong took one step forward, and in the next second, he appeared above the hotspring, right above Mo Jincheng and the four maids’ heads.

When Huang Xiaolong appeared, Mo Jincheng was still in the throes of passion that he didn’t detect Hunag Xiaolong’s presence. Only until a dozen breaths later, Mo Jincheng finally reacted.

“Who?!” He got up in alarm.

When Mo Jincheng saw Huang Xiaolong, his organ below shrunk instantly, and he stammered in shock, “H-H-Huang, Huang Xiaolong!”

Someone, they had assumed to be dead, had once again appeared right in front of him silently. Due to this even an experienced cultivator like Mo Jincheng was shaken.

The four maids also scrambled up and stood beside Mo Jincheng. There was no fear on their faces, and they were curiously checking out Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong? The four maids had no idea who that was. They didn’t recall hearing about someone with that name.

“It’s you, Huang Xiaolong! You’re actually still alive!” Mo Jincheng regained his composure a second later, sneering mockingly as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re really lucky, but do you know, you’ve made one mistake.”

“Oh,” Huang Xiaolong crossed his arms over his chest and looked at Mo Jincheng with an interested expression.

Mo Jincheng elaborated coldly, “In the past, the Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Fang Ding had come swaggering into my Devil Eye City, wanting to plunder my race’s treasury, but he didn’t succeed. Instead, he left with one arm less! He fled in such a sorry state that he hasn't dared to show up ever since then!”

As if he was afraid that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t believe him, Mo Jincheng took out a cut-off arm belonging to a Primal Ancestor.

The arm still exuded a vague grand dao energy as the arm’s flesh, blood, and bones were condensed from grand dao energy, proving that it was indeed the arm of a Primal Ancestor. Most likely, like Mo Jincheng had said, the arm belonged to that Fang Ding because the grand dao energy of low-level Primal Ancestors was not as perfect.

“So what?” Huang Xiaolong coldly took a glance at the arm.

Mo Jincheng was stunned.

“Little guy, do you think you’re stronger than Fang Ding?” One of the four maids mocked Huang Xiaolong, “How about Sister play with you?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother to look at the maid, and with a casual flick of his finger, he reduced the peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saint maid into bloody mistS without even giving her a chance to scream.

The other three maids were stupefied, and their faces paled as they retreated in fear, hiding behind Mo Jincheng. Huang Xiaolong looked like the devil in their eyes.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you kill my maid?” Mo Jincheng glared at Huang Xiaolong, as his expression became gloomy to the extreme, and he spat through gritted teeth, “You’re courting death!” And he suddenly punched out with his fists.

Mo Jincheng’s cultivation was at the early Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, and everyone within the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s territory could feel the turbulent airflow from the power of his fists’ force.

In a split second, the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s Patriarch Mo Rui, Young Patriarch Mo Jun, and others sensed it. But before Mo Rui, Mo Jun, and the others understood what was going on, a loud blast ensued. Then, they saw a figure smashed through several luxurious residences, before crashing a few meters from Mo Rui and the others’ feet.

The entire Devil Eye City was swaying as if the city was about to collapse.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Mo Rui, Mo Jun, and other Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s experts looked at the figure on the ground with blank faces. Who was the person lying at their feet if not Mo Jincheng?

Mo Jincheng was completely naked, and his body, especially his lower body, was stained with blood. One could only wonder if Mo Jincheng’s lower body was injured, or if he had spurted blood earlier and accidentally dyed his lower body.

Mo Rui, Mo Jun, and the present Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s experts couldn’t believe what they were seeing. In these hundreds of millions of years, this was the first time they were seeing their Old Ancestor Mo Jincheng injured!

“Old Ancestor, are you…?”

While in shock, they suddenly looked up to the sky. There was an ebony-haired young man looking down at them with a chilling cold gaze.

“Activate the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation!” Since Mo Rui and others still had not reacted, Mo Jincheng climbed up from the ground and bellowed in a fury.

Mo Rui, Mo Jun, and the others were jolted to their senses, and in a fluster, they activated the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation that had not been used for a long time. Immediately, numerous devilish rays of light shot up, interwoven into a huge net that covered the scope of Devil Eye City. On each intersection of the net was a devilish pupil.

These devilish pupils glowed an eerie red and had ghastly runes running over their surfaces.

After seeing the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation activated, Mo Jincheng’s confidence returned at full force, and his face twisted as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, I want you dead!”

As he spoke, a similar devilish light soared from his body, resonating with the entire Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation.
