Also take a strike from my palm?

The crowd dazedly looked at Huang Xiaolong for a second, then followed by whopping laughter. The group of Golden Phoenix Pavilion disciples laughed the loudest when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s words.

“This punk actually wants Senior Brother Li Zhi to take his attack? Haha! Does he think that he is a match for Senior Brother Li Zhi’s strength?!”

“Senior Brother Li Zhi generously allowed him to leave, but this punk is literally seeking death!”

The Golden Phoenix Pavilion disciples mocked and ridiculed loudly.

Wang Yu said to Li Ting, “It’s been a while since I came upon something so interesting.”

Li Ting smiled sweetly like a blossoming flower, which quickened Wang Yu’s blood.

This turn of events was completely unexpected for Li Zhi. He had allowed them to leave, yet this punk had turned around and challenged him? That’s no different from playing with the tiger’s whiskers; a punk that simply doesn’t know the meaning of death!

“Are you sure you want to do this?” Li Zhi’s gaze turned icy as he glared at Huang Xiaolong and he continued, “I’m honestly telling you, I merely used ten percent of my strength in the Phantasm Sword Palm just now.”

Ten percent! The crowd gasped at the information that Li Zhi just revealed.

“Did I not say it? How was it even possible that Senior Brother Li Zhi’s strength could not send that unknown early Sixth Order Ancient God Realm punk flying with that attack? Senior Brother Li Zhi merely used one-tenth of his strength, that explains it!”

“But this punk should be feeling proud of being able to take Senior Brother Li Zhi’s attack even though it was only ten percent of Senior Brother Li Zhi’s strength!”

“What a joke, this punk didn’t run as fast as he could when he had the chance! Probably, his intestines must be green with regret right now, but it’s too late for any regrets; we’ve got another good show to watch.”

At the center of the crowd’s talk and gloating eyes, there were no change in Huang Xiaolong’s expression. He looked at Li Zhi and said indifferently, “I am sure about this. I’ll give you ten breaths to prepare.”

“Ten breaths!”

A small sect expert snorted loudly, and then shook his head in a mocking sneer. Everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong not only had some problems just in his head, but his entire body was problematic.

The frosty black light covered Li Zhi’s eyes completely; earlier, he had given Huang Xiaolong three breaths’ time to prepare, but now, Huang Xiaolong had insulted Li Zhi by giving him ten breaths’ time.

According to Li Zhi, Huang Xiaolong was taunting him in front of so many people!

‘He, Li Zhi, the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s greatest genius, who had reached Seventh Order Ancient God Realm was actually being taunted by an early Sixth Order Ancient God Realm punk?!’

Li Zhi suddenly laughed—no, he was beaming. “Go ahead and make your move!” He had inwardly decided to employ half of his strength to take Huang Xiaolong’s attack, and at the same time, he wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong by making him explode into pieces when he died with just one slap.

Li Zhi had barely finished speaking, when Huang Xiaolong had already disappeared from where he stood. He appeared in front of Li Zhi in the next moment with his palm slapping down.

Huang Xiaolong did not use his three supreme godheads’ godforce, but purely used his True Dragon Physique’s raw power at full force.

BO-OM⸺!

Huang Xiaolong’s full force palm struck heavily on Li Zhi’s chest. At the same time, numerous sword qi pierced through Li Zhi’s body.

The crowd could see dazzling sword qi flying out from Li Zhi’s back.

Li Zhi’s body was perforated by numerous sword qi, and blood squirted out like arrows.

Li Zhi stood stiffly, especially because of the excruciating pain which he had never felt before, while panic gripped at his heart. First, the flesh on the right side of his face cracked, then on the left side. In the end, his eyeballs protruded out from their sockets, while his mouth was wide open—like someone who was trying to shout, but no sound was coming out.

It seemed like the time had frozen in that moment, as various sects’ experts were watching the scene that had just unfolded in front of them with befuddled expressions.

Roughly a dozen breaths later, Li Zhi’s body flew backward like a broken kite, and smashed into the group of the Golden Phoenix Pavilion disciples. All the disciples were knocked into the air along with him.

“Brother Li Zhi!”

“Younger brother!”

Wang Yu and Li Ting cried out.

All of a sudden, the street was in chaos.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said to Cheng Susu, as she was wearing a very shocked expression on her face.

His words woke up Cheng Susu to the present, and she quickly followed behind Huang Xiaolong.

Noticing Huang Xiaolong and Cheng Susu leaving, Li Ting screamed, “Hurry, block them! Kill them!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At Li Ting’s command, the two Black Region World’s Fortune Gate branch disciples tried to stop Huang Xiaolong and Cheng Susu from leaving, but they were knocked away by Huang Xiaolong; the impact even shattered their internal organs.

Huang Xiaolong, Cheng Susu, and the little cow disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Li Ting went pale as she looked at her younger brother’s injuries. She then stood up, holding something that resembled a fireworks cylinder and released a distress signal into the air. Fireworks took the shape of a golden phoenix that soared high into the sky, emitting a crisp cry that reached every corner of the Void Sky City.

At the golden phoenix’s cry, the experts all over the Void Sky City looked up towards the sky; whether they were drinking or eating inside restaurants, or selling things by the streetside at the market, everyone was looking up at the golden phoenix over the Void Sky City.

“This is the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s golden phoenix order!”

“Who offended someone that possesses the golden phoenix order! They sure must be tired of living!!"

Everyone in the city was astonished to see the appearance of the golden phoenix in the sky.

At the same time, Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciples rushed towards the direction of the golden phoenix order from each and every corner of the city. The Void Sky City was covered in tension and a gloomy atmosphere.

After Huang Xiaolong’s group got out of sight, Huang Xiaolong had the little cow cast an illusion technique on Cheng Susu to completely alter her appearance.

Even so, it was not a hundred percent safe. They couldn’t stay in the Void Sky City anymore, and most importantly, Huang Xiaolong needed to send away Cheng Susu safely.

A few hours later, when the three of them reached the Void Sky City’s city gates, it was surrounded by layers of Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciples, and they were inspecting every person who was trying to leave the city.

However, these disciples’ strength was too low to see through the little cow’s illusionary technique. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong’s group smoothly passed through the inspection and left the city safely.

After exiting the Void Sky City, Huang Xiaolong wanted to make sure that Cheng Susu left the the Void Sky Mainland safely; only then would he feel some relief.

“What? Xiaolong, y-you, you’re not going back to the Vientiane World?” Cheng Susu was astonished and worried when she heard that Huang Xiaolong was going back to the Vientiane World. “That-that’s too dangerous, the Golden Phoenix Pavilion...!”

“I know.” Huang Xiaolong spoke nonchalantly, and reassured her, “Don’t worry about me, I’ll be alright. You go back first, I have to buy something in the Clear Spirit World. I will return after that.”

Since Huang Xiaolong strongly insisted on going to the Clear Spirit World, Cheng Susu had no way to persuade him otherwise. She smiled and said, “You have saved me once again.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “What can I do, I just like to be a hero?”

Cheng Susu grinned at his words, “You know, I’m not some great beauty when compared to Li Lu; in fact, I’m just an ugly girl.”

Huang Xiaolong pretended to scrutinize Cheng Susu from left to right and from the front to the back, and then exclaimed in an exaggerated tone, “Where’s the ugly girl?”

Cheng Susu’s happy laughter rang in the air.

A while later, the two of them separated. Cheng Susu returned to the Vientiane World, whereas Huang Xiaolong turned back to the Void Sky City for the transmission array. In order to go to the Clear Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong had no other choice but to go inside the Void Sky city once again.

He wasn’t worried about Cheng Susu’s safety anymore, as the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s forces were mainly concentrated on the Void Sky Mainland. On top of that, the little cow’s illusion technique would keep Cheng Susu safe.

Back in the Void Sky City, Huang Xiaolong went straight towards the transmission array.

Just as Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were on their way to the transmission array, the ground suddenly shook and swayed violently, just like a massive earthquake.

Right before Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, fissures and cracks appeared on the Void Sky City’s streets.
