Chapter 212: Soul Mandate

Noticing the weird expression on Xie Puti’s face, Huang Xiaolong bent his head down to check himself. His clothes were still on, there was nothing wrong as far as he could tell.

At this point, Xie Puti exaggeratedly reached out to touch Huang Xiaolong’s forehead, saying, “I say bro, are you still dreaming?”

“Dreaming?” Huang Xiaolong was genuinely confused.

“We’re already out of Saint Pavilion.” Xie Puti said, “But when you were transferred out, you were sleeping and no matter how I tried, you wouldn’t wake up! Please don’t tell me you spent the entire month inside Saint Pavilion... sleeping?”

Guilt flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s face at Xie Puti’s baffled expression, and he smiled and nodded awkwardly in admission.

Xie Puti’s eyes rounded in shock and he pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong. He then burst out into a hearty laughter, “Damn bro, you’re too fierce! I think you’re the first person that entered Saint Pavilion to sleep. Moreover, you slept the entire one month~!”

What Xie Puti said was nothing but the truth. In the history of Duanren Institute’s opening of the pavilion, there hadn’t been any student that went inside to take a nap!

“We are in one of the yards in my Xie Manor.” Xie Puti clarified after his laughter stopped, “We’ve been transferred out for half a day. Seeing that you wouldn’t wake up, I brought you over here to my Xie Manor first. How about it, let’s head to Sapidity Wine House for a few hundred jugs of celebratory wine!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement.

Although he badly wanted to return to Southern Hill Estate to check if there were any strange issues with his body, he had promised Xie Puti before entering Saint Pavilion that they would go for a drink. Hence, he was too embarrassed to refuse.

“Great, good bro, let’s go!” Xie Puti pulled Huang Xiaolong enthusiastically out of Xie Manor towards Sapidity Wine House’s direction in Duanren Institute.

On their way, Huang Xiaolong subtlely immersed his spiritual sense into his body to check its condition.

The second his spiritual sense entered his body, a burst of frenzied joy hit Huang Xiaolong.

The Absolute Soul Pearl! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Right above his soul sea hovered three of the Heavenly Treasuresㅡ Linglong Treasure Pagoda, God Binding Ring, and the Absolute Soul Pearl. The three Heavenly Treasures positioned themselves in a triangle, each shrouded in a soft halo.

An amber red, an aureate gold, and a deep purple glow. Three different colored halos intermingled, blending together.

The Absolute Soul Pearl did not push the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and God Binding Ring away like it had in the bone valley, but rather co-existed peacefully.

What happened? Huang Xiaolong was happy but also confused.

When he lost consciousness, drowning in the thousands of white bones and evil Yin energy, he thought he was going to die. However, not only did he not die, he even succeeded in reining in the Absolute Soul Pearl.

The Absolute Soul Pearl!

The fourth treasure on the Heavenly Treasure List!

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath.

He had finally gotten his hands on the Absolute Soul Pearl! Next, he would journey to the Blessed Buddha Empire to search for Godly Mt. Xumi!

Six years!

Regardless of anything else, he must break through to Xiantian Tenth Order by then!

Continuing to scan the changes in his body, Huang Xiaolong noted that his battle qi cultivation had broken passed peak late-Xiantian First Order, moving through early-Xiantian Second Order... eventually reaching peak early-Xiantian Second Order and could break into mid-Xiantian Second Order at anytime. Even his internal force had advanced by a large stride!

His battle qi and internal force growing stronger was nothing but wonderful news to Huang Xiaolong.

Was that evil Yin energy not actually harmful, but instead beneficial? Otherwise, Huang Xiaolong could not find a logical explanation for his drastic increased strength in battle qi and internal force in merely one short month of time!

“Bro, are you alright?” Xie Puti noticed that Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts seemed to be off somewhere in the distance and asked out of concern.

Realizing where he was, Huang Xiaolong pulled his attention back to the present as he shook his head at Xie Puti:“I’m fine.”

He reaped a good harvest from this one month spent in Saint Pavilion! It was well worth the sleep he took!

Hearing that, Xie Puti laughed, “It’s been quite a while since we came here; us brothers will enjoy till we’re both drunk or neither of us can go home!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “We won’t get drunk even if we drink for months!”

Both burst into laughter.

Indeed, with their Xiantian realm cultivation, it would be hard to get drunk even if they drank nonstop for several months.

A short while later, the two of them walked into Sapidity Wine House, and because they were early this month, there were over four hundred jugs remaining. Huang Xiaolong ordered the waiter, “Send all the remaining four hundred plus Sapidity Wine jugs up here!”

More than four hundred jugs, that amounted to over four million gold coins!

The waiter was stunned and he turned to look at Xie Puti.

Xie Puti laughed, “This time my bro is treating me. Since he told you to serve them up, then serve them up!”

The waiter looked at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief and shock.

Huang Xiaolong threw a golden card at him.

Catching the golden card in bewilderment, the waiter said, “Young Noble Xie, Young Noble Huang, please wait a moment. I’ll go have all the remaining Sapidity Wine sent up!” Quickly turning around, the waiter went to arrange the wine, not forgetting to set up a table of excellent side dishes for them.

Not wasting time, Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti clinked their wine cups, savoring the wine and food.

This time, Huang Xiaolong achieved his purpose of entering Saint Pavilion, reining in the Absolute Soul Pearl, and increasing his battle qi and internal force. These good events contributed to his good mood.

But not long after they started drinking, Guo Zhi and Guo Fei were seen walking into Sapidity Wine House, walking and chatting at the same time.

“Didn’t expect that in the Saint Pavilion’s opening this time, Duan Wuhen would arrange Jiang Yang and Liu Zhi to protect doggy Huang. Damnit, that Guo Xufei failed to kill him!”

“Don’t worry, when Ancestor comes out after successfully breaking into the Saint realm, that will by the day Huang Xiaolong and Zhao Shu meet their maker!”

“I heard doggy Huang went in Saint Pavilion to sleep. Now, the entire Imperial City is singing rumors that doggy Huang is a sleeping pig!”

Both laughed sinisterly as they talked and failed to notice Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti sitting inside the restaurant. Perhaps it was more accurate to say the Guo Brothers never imagined Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti would be here drinking on the same day they got out of Saint Pavilion.

Entering the establishment, Guo Zhi and Guo Fei felt a frigid air surround them, thus raised their heads. Only at that moment did they finally notice Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti’s presence.

The brothers paled instantly, bouncing back in fright. Without waiting, both of them turned around and fled in panic.

“Don’t worry about it.” When Xie Puti wanted to get up, Huang Xiaolong pushed him back down saying, “Don’t let two clowns dampen our drinking spirit.”

Xie Puti laughed loudly at this remark, “As you wish!”

Cups continued to clink.

It was several hours later when they stepped out of the restaurant, leaving the Institute, Huang Xiaolong returned to Southern Hill Estate.

It was already late by the time Huang Xiaolong arrived at Southern Hill Estate. After calling Fei Hou and discussing matters related to Southern Hill Estate for the past month, Huang Xiaolong initiated the God Binding Ring and entered the ancient battlefield. There, he summoned the Absolute Soul Pearl out of his body.

Holding the fist-sized purple pearl in his hand, Huang Xiaolong dripped a drop of blood onto its smooth surface. As the blood seeped into the pearl, a brilliant purple light burst out. At the same time, the same purple color character for ‘soul*’ flew out, entering Huang Xiaolong’s soul from the middle of his eyebrows. Another sequence of memories flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind related to the Absolute Soul Pearl, including the methods to control it.

Huang Xiaolong discovered something from these memories. Other than the Absolute Soul Finger, the Absolute Soul Pearl contained another profound secret law called Soul Mandate!

This Soul Mandate was a secret law to control a person’s soul!

Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted by this new information. If what he was shown was true, didn’t that mean he could rein in and control other people after he practiced this secret law?

Furthermore, this Soul Mandate applied to human and beast alikeㅡit applied to all living beings!
