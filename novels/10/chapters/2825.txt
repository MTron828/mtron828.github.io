Chapter 2826: Experiencing the Might of the Absolute Flame and Frost!

The absolute beauty standing beside Yu Sheng looked at Huang Xiaolong with an indescribable expression.

She was Fang Jing’s direct disciple, and she was Yu Sheng’s junior sister! Her talent was no less than Yi Xiaotang.

A look of disdain flashed through her eyes, and she stared condescendingly at Huang Xiaolong. She had seen a lot of disciples like him.

How dare an early-Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor challenge four Dao Venerables?!

It isn’t possible for him to win!

She had eight high-order Saint Fates, but even so, she wasn’t able to challenge a single Dao Venerable. Even if Huang Xiaolong had ten high-order Saint Fates, it wouldn’t be possible for him to beat a single one!

In fact, there wasn’t a need to mention Dao Venerables. If he could defeat high-level Primal Ancestors, it would be more than enough to shock countless creeds!

Xiang Yi, who had been standing behind her all this while, started to walk towards Yi Beihang and the others. He greeted them, “Master, this disciple is willing to take Huang Xiaolong down! I shall capture him immediately!”

Even though Xiang Yi’s talent was inferior to the Saint Devil Prince, he was still the direct disciple of Yan San. He was the leader of the disciples, and he was no weakling.

As a half-step Dao Venerable Realm expert, Xiang Yi’s comprehension of the grand dao laws had already reached a terrifying stage.

There were almost thirty Dao Venerables in the Blue Heaven Creed, and he was ranked in the top three!

Not even Fu Daosheng, an expert standing at the top of an entire region, was stronger than him! When compared to Xu Jian and Xiang Yi, he was like a weak little child!

Receiving Xiang Yi’s request to take action, Yi Beihang nodded as he knew the hidden meaning behind his words. Not only did he wish to take revenge for Xu Jian, but he also wished to vent Yan San’s anger!

“End it quickly!” Yi Beihang snorted. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Even though his daughter had mentioned that Huang Xiaolong had exterminated the Saint Devil Prince’s grand dao physique, he was still confident in Xiang Yi’s strength.

He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong could fight above his cultivation realm as a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

Moreover, he didn’t want to believe that Huang Xiaolong had destroyed Xu Jian’s grand dao physique.

There was no way someone could control the power of absolute flame and frost at the same time!

Yan San added, “Use everything you have! It’s fine as long as he lives.”

He wouldn’t care if Huang Xiaolong was crippled.

When Xiang Yi heard Yan San, he bowed respectfully, “You can rest assured that I’ll deal with him.” After that, he walked towards Huang Xiaolong.

Xiang Yi glared at Huang Xiaolong coldly as a vertical eye opened between his eyebrows. It was the Blue Heavenly Eye, and he could examine Huang Xiaolong from inside out.

That wasn’t all the Blue Heavenly Eye could do. It could also attack the soul!

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you challenge my master and teacher? What a joke!” Xiang Yi sneered, “Junior Sister Xiaotang said that you control the power of absolute flame and frost. Let’s see if that’s true!”

There was a trace of ridicule in his voice.

In the Divine Tuo Holy World, there is no one with the ability to control both the power of absolute frost and flame. He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would be the one to break the precedent!

Yu Sheng and Fang Jing were stunned.

What?

Yu Sheng and Fang Jing looked at Yi Xiaotang. They wanted to know if Huang Xiaolong really possessed the ability to wield both the power of absolute flame and frost.

According to them, she was lying!

However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t one to give them time to think! As his body flickered, he appeared right in front of them. A fist flew out as terrifying rays of blue emerged.

Their faces changed instantly. Could it be?!

Bang!

A muffled cry sounded in the air as Xiang Yi was sent flying.

Before anyone could react, Huang Xiaolong followed up with another punch. This time, a crimson red glow covered his fist as blinding red light threatened to blind everyone watching.

Bang!

Xiang Yi was once again sent flying.

By the time he fell to the ground, his entire body was encased in ice. He turned into a human-shaped ice sculpture.

“Absolute frost!”

Several people cried out in unison.

Red flames emerged from Xiang Yi’s body, and an unusually beautiful flower of flames bloomed from within the sculpture.

“Absolute flame!”

Their screams sounded in the air once again, but Fang Jing joined them. It was as though she had seen a miracle, and her eyes widened in shock.

The experts of the Blue Heaven Creed were dumbfounded by what they saw.

Huang Xiaolong looked indifferently at the body that was melting and said, “I’ll grant your wish to see the power of absolute frost and flame.”

His voice echoed in the skies and struck the minds of everyone present.

Yan San snapped back to reality when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s voice, and he couldn’t hide the shock in his heart.

Huang Xiaolong possessed both the power of absolute flame and frost! A Primal Ancestor was powerful enough to wield both of them!

There was also the matter of Xiang Yi, a head disciple of a creed, a half-step Dao Venerable, was beaten down by Huang Xiaolong in a single move!

No one could believe what they were seeing.

“You… Do you really only have eight high-order Saint Fates?!” Yu Sheng asked in horror.
