Old woman, Old Tong smiled amiably. “Fine, fine, fine, as long as you like it, my little princess.”

The pretty young lady flashed her a brilliant smile. She sounded innocent as she said, “I know Old Tong loves me the most.” Her eyes bent into crescents as she pouted. “Let’s see who dares to fight with me.”

The two women chuckled warmly.

Then, Huang Xiaolong’s voice sounded from private room number six, “Twelve million high grade-seven spirit stones!”

Twelve million!

The crowd below was in an uproar.

Inside private room number five, Gudu Yue was beaming with confidence up until now as he had ten million high grade-seven spirit stones in his pocket. But the bid of twelve million made him feel humiliated and extremely hateful.

Also, inside private room number seven, the pretty young lady’s mouth pouted higher when she heard Huang Xiaolong bid of twelve million. She called out, “Thirteen million high grade-seven spirit stones!”

Thirteen million!

Gasps of shock and disbelief echoed through the auction hall once more.

Inside private room number six, Huang Xiaolong was frowning. Although the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit ranked third amongst the world’s seven wonder fruits, it was not as effective for a God King Realm master. Thus, it shouldn’t be this expensive. He had estimated to win these fruits by closing the bid at around seven to eight million high grade-seven spirit stones, but this person had actually raised the price to thirteen million!

Judging from the person’s voice, she would continue to raise the price and won’t give up.

Huang Xiaolong considered for a moment then called out, "Fourteen million high grade-seven spirit stones."

"Fifteen million high grade-seven spirit stones!"

As expected, the moment Huang Xiaolong made a bid, the young lady’s voice followed to raise the bid.

“Just learn from me, and bid twenty million!” The little cow said to Huang Xiaolong. “You won’t be able to bid for the Thunderstorm Divine Robe, but those Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits are very important to you.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

His priority was to grow stronger. Therefore, no matter what, he needed to win the bid for these Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits.

“Twenty million high grade-seven spirit stones!” Huang Xiaolong stopped hesitating and shouted twenty million, as per the little cow’s advice.

Twenty million!

The crowd below exploded. This was frightening, even for the first-rank forces’ Grand Elders and Elders, and even their Patriarchs and Sect Chiefs were shaking.

Chairs tumbled to the floor out of order.

Luo Fan was trying his best to hold onto the edge of the table to avoid tumbling down in shock.

The pretty young lady in private room number seven was smiling, and her eyes bent into crescents. Just as she was about to raise the bid again, Old Tong stopped her. “Miss, we’ve brought forty million high grade-seven spirit stones. If we keep insisting on buying these Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits, we might not be able to get the Thunderstorm Divine Robe.”

They were specifically attending this auction for the Thunderstorm Divine Robe.

The pretty young lady blanked for a second, but she relented in the end. "Alright then." Then she let out a grumpy harrumph and ordered, "Who’s that jerk next door? Send someone to find out, he actually dared to compete with me for the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits!"

Old Tong smiled helplessly but agreed, “Alright, Miss. I’ll send someone to find out more information about the person next door.”

In the end, Huang Xiaolong successfully won the bid for the eighteen Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits at twenty million high grade-seven spirit stones.

Huang Xiaolong inwardly sighed in relief after securing the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits.

The auction’s supervisor personally sent the crystal box containing eighteen Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits to Huang Xiaolong, after he made the payment of million high grade-seven spirit stones.

Delight rushed to Huang Xiaolong’s chest as he received the crystal box from the auction supervisor. After the supervisor left, Huang Xiaolong placed all eighteen fruits into his Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space, as he planned to refine them later.

“‘Congratulations to the honored guest in private room number six for successfully bidding for the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits. Our next auction item is our final auction item. It’s a low-grade grandmist spiritual artifact, the Thunderstorm Divine Robe!” Luo Fan’s voice reverberated in the hall.

The auction supervisor stepped up to the auction stage and placed a crystal box on the table.

No one could see the Thunderstorm Divine Robe inside the crystal box, but could feel a raging tempest!

That raging tempest inside the crystal box collided against the walls of the crystal box as it unleashed its destructive power within the crystal box.

Luo Fan smiled widely as he began, “I believe everyone can already guess that this raging tempest is the manifestation of the Thunderstorm Divine Robe. A low-grade grandmist spiritual artifact, the Thunderstorm Divine Robe can transform into a tempestuous wind form, and could be attached to any part of the body. It could be soft and gentle, but also vigorous and violent. It can both attack and defend. On top of that, if you’re powerful enough, you can cover a hundred thousand li radius area with unimaginably destructive thunderstorms!”

Luo Fan introduced the Thunderstorm Divine Robe’s power and usage with a lot of vigor to the audience.

The crowd looked at the crystal box with feverish eyes.

“Of course, in addition to these benefits, you can borrow the wind element power of the robe to increase your flying speed when you wear the Thunderstorm Divine Robe. But that depends on the individual’s situation, therefore, the increased speed varies from person to person. Nonetheless if they are strong enough it could double a person’s flying speed!”

Increase flying speed!

Listening to this, all eyes in the hall shone brighter than before. Even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help feeling tempted.

Speed was one of the essential things when facing an enemy., Overall Huang Xiaolong’s speed was faster than average, but with the additional boost from the Thunderstorm Divine Robe, his speed would be even more shocking.

“‘Now then, we will start the auction for Thunderstorm Divine Robe. The starting price is ten million low grade-seven spirit stones.” Luo Fan concluded.

The noisy auction hall suddenly quieted down.

“11 million low grade-seven spirit stones!” The guest from private room number one called out.

“13 million low grade-seven spirit stones!”

In the blink of an eye, the price was gone up to twenty million low grade-seven spirit stones.

Twenty million low grade-seven spirit stones was equivalent to five million high grade-seven spirit stones.

Inside private room number five, Gudu Yue shouted, “Six million high grade-seven spirit stones.”

Huang Xiaolong who had been silent until now sneered at Gudu Yue’s bid, “Ten million high grade-seven spirit stones!”’

Ten million! High grade-seven spirit stones!

The moment Huang Xiaolong acted, the lively auction hall turned cold.

Gudu Yue immediately turned scarlet with bloodthirst upon hearing Huang Xiaolong’s voice. He spat through gritted teeth, “I must tear that scum with my own hands!”

“Twenty million high grade-seven spirit stones!” It seemed like the young lady from private room number seven was adamant to compete with Huang Xiaolong, therefore she instantly raised the price up to twenty million high grade-seven spirit stones, after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s bid!

The people below felt their limbs go cold.

Huang Xiaolong frowned, with a slight displeasure. Even though he had condensed quite a lot of high grade-seven spirit stones, he was left with a little over thirty million high grade-seven spirit stones, after purchasing the space velocity stones and Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits.

After a brief pause, Huang Xiaolong shouted, “Thirty million high grade-seven spirit stones!”

Thirty million!

There was an uproar in the auction hall once more. Some families’ Patriarchs felt heaviness in their chests. A pile of thirty million high-grade spirit stones rivaled a thousand zhang tall mountain that could squash a person to death.

The pretty young lady from private room number seven sonorously shouted, “Forty million high grade-seven spirit stones!”

Several guests in the auction hall below had an impulse to faint and never wake up.

Luo Fan wanted to hold onto the table with both of his hands, but he barely managed to do so, as his knees nearly buckled. He had initially thought it was already a good harvest if the Thunderstorm Divine Robe could fetch ten million high grade-seven spirit stones...
