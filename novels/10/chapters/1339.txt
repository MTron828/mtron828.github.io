Two days later...

While Huang Xiaolong’s group was flying towards the periphery of the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield, a roar suddenly thundered from the direction in front of them. Sound waves rushed towards Huang Xiaolong’s group, and a brutal aura ensued. In the next second, Huang Xiaolong and the others heard several gut-wrenching screams.

Everyone in Huang Xiaolong’s group halted in apprehension as they experienced the brutal roiling aura and tremendous pressure.

“It’s a God King Realm master!” Feng Er blurted out almost immediately.

The Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders’ faces ashened at her words.

“It’s likely to be an escaped devil from the Devil World!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng added.

A God King Realm devil!

Huang Xiaolong too was startled by Feng Er’s exclamation.

“But Master, rest assured! This devil is only a peak late-First Order God King Realm!” Void devil beast said calmly and confidently.

“Let’s go over and take a look.” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered with curiosity.

Although it was a peak late-First Order God King Realm devil, he believed that the void devil beast’s strength could suppress the other side.

Although Huang Xiaolong had entered the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield for so long, he had yet to encounter any devils from the Devil World, and he very much wanted to see one.

“Go—!”

With Huang Xiaolong in the lead, Feng Er, and the rest followed behind him and flew towards the source of the roar.

The closer they got, the stronger the brutal coercion came at them, making it harder for them to breathe. A curtain of sand obscured their sight as mountains crumbled, and booming collisions grew louder. Obviously, a battle had broken out between the devil, and another side. It wasn’t one person, but a group of people!

Everyone’s expression grew heavier by the second.

Ghostly fog surged out from Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er’s bodies, whereas the little cow’s six chaos spiritual beast lackeys were enshrouded in various bright lights. The Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders also hastened to circulate their godforce and formed a protective barrier over themselves.

The power of a God King Realm master was no joke; just a little hit from this beast, could reduce them to dregs.

Huang Xiaolong activated the Yellow Springs Magic Robe, and it unfolded in the air behind him. Devil qi flooded out, guarding Huang Xiaolong.

Soon, the group was close enough to see the ongoing battle.

In the distance, a group of people was attacking a giant winged devil. It had a sharp horn on its forehead and lantern-sized scarlet eyes, and black devil qi that was as thick as clouds!

The peak late-First Order God King Realm devil spat out black energy balls from his mouth. Every energy ball crumbled down a mountain, or completely destroyed one of the human experts until nothing was left.

The ground cracked, opening abyssal fissures as the battle went on.

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived, the God King Realm devil tore open one of the human experts, and blood splattered everywhere.

It was brutal and tragic. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders were now pale as a sheet.

They could clearly see that on the human side of the war, the weakest realm was still a Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, while many of them were peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm masters. But they were nothing more than paper tigers when compared to the God King Realm devil.

“Baisheng, go help!” Huang Xiaolong ordered as soon as he saw this scene.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng shook his head. “No, I must stay here to protect Master’s...”

Before he could finish, the little cow gave him a kick on his big butt and scolded, “Master ordered you to go, so you go. Where are all these excuses coming from?!”

The void devil beast Xu Baisheng had no other option but run towards the battle. He ran while rubbing his hurt butt.

Huang Xiaolong was speechless. But he had to admit that the old cow’s words were more effective than his. Not to mention, probably, little cow was the only one who dared to kick Xu Baisheng’s butt.

With a Great Space Teleportation, void devil beast Xu Baisheng arrived above the battle.

Almost immediately, the God King Realm devil roared furiously as it detected Xu Baisheng’s interference. His violent nature broke out, and he punched upwards at Xu Baisheng. Xu Baisheng raised his paws to meet the attack head-on.

R-R-Rumble!

The land quaked and swayed violently.

Even more peaks and mountains shattered and crumbled, while sand and dust swirled like a storm.

Alarming shockwaves swept outwards from the battle between two God King Realm masters, crushing everything along the path. Several human race warriors who were late in dodging the shockwaves were sent flying to the mountains and forests in the far distance.

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s group was some distance away, they were forced to stagger backwards repeatedly.

Fortunately, everyone was prepared, but nonetheless, it was still frightening.

Everyone saw the God King Realm devil tumbling and smashing into a mountain far away from the collision. A screeching scream cut through the air.

Just as everyone anticiptedthe God King Realm devil to retaliate, he simply turned into a streak of black light and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

He fled!

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng was dumbfounded too. He hesitated for a while, but then decided against chasing the God King Realm devil. Instead, he returned to Huang Xiaolong’s side.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the miserable mountains. He then noticed that the human race experts were only knocked back, without any severe injuries. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong decided on resuming his journey instead of approaching them.

At the moment, Huang Xiaolong did not wish to reveal his strength, nor did he want to reveal that he had a Second Order God King Realm master by his side.

After Huang Xiaolong’s group left, the human race experts gradually struggled up from the piles of rubble on the ground.

They looked at each other, and had the same thought in their minds—that God King Realm devil fled?! And, what was that beast that defeated that God King Realm devil? They had merely caught a blurry image of Xu Baisheng..

...

Huang Xiaolong’s group flew onwards without stopping.

A few hours later, Huang Xiaolong’s heart quivered. Ecstasy rose to his eyes, ‘what is this?! Grandmist aura!’ He had actually sensed the grandmist aura’s presence!

Within ten thousand li radius from here!

Huang Xiaolong could barely contain his excitement and accelerated forward.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and others were baffled when they saw Huang Xiaolong accelerating with an excited expression. But they flew faster and caught up with Huang Xiaolong.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to reach an ancient forest, where he could sense the grandmist aura’s presence.

Thick towering trees with lush ink-colored leaves veiled the ground below.

“Manor Lord, look out! It’s dangerous down there!” Feng Er cautioned as she arrived at Huang Xiaolong’s side. She sensed a powerful magical beast crouching in the forest underneath. It probably had the strength of a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong nodded to indicate that he was aware of the danger. When everyone arrived, he said, “We’re going down!”

Since there was grandmist aura in this ancient forest, regardless of the dangers, Huang Xiaolong was determined to enter it.

His Grandmist Parasitic Medium cultivation had reached the limit of the first stage, therefore he urgently needed the grandmist aura to breakthrough to the crucial second stage!

Shuttling through the ink-colored leaves, the group entered the ancient forest. Everything turned dark once they were inside, and greyish black miasma floated around them. Huang Xiaolong took out some detoxification chaos spiritual pills and distributed them to the rest of his group. After everyone swallowed their detoxification pill, Huang Xiaolong flew in the direction from where he sensed the grandmist aura.

Ssssshhhh!

A while later, as they were flying, a low-level Ancestor God Realm magical beast drilled out from the forest floor and pounced onto Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong looked at the attacking beast and saw that it was a late-Second Order Ancestor God Realm Crimson Blossom Python.

The Sky Dragon Blood Knife appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand and he slashed it faster than lighting. More than two hundred blood-red knife rays shot out. In the blink of an eye, the Crimson Blossom Python was sliced into two hundred pieces.
