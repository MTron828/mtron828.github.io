Chapter 3722: Appearance of the White Feathers King

The three other Universe Origin Fires emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body soon after.

The moment they appeared, a terrifying sea of flames engulfed the lands. The thick wall of Black Source Ice started to melt in the face of the Universe Origin Fires.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The liquid that came from the melted ice flooded the surroundings.

Both the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng stared at the melting ice and their eyebrows shot up in surprise.

Roaring in disbelief, the White Deer raged, “Why didn’t you tell me that you had the Universe Origin Fires?!”

“You didn’t tell me that the Universe Source Stone was stuck in a mountain of Black Source Ice.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong silently, the White Deer could only blame itself.

“Since I have the Universe Origin Fires, I should be able to obtain the Universe Source Stone, right?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The White Deer stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression on its face. “You probably can…” There was a look of reluctance on its face when it saw the four Universe Origin Fires hovering around Huang Xiaolong. It had long since pined for the Universe Source Stone. There was no way it could remain calm as it watched such a precious treasure being taken away.

After all, the Universe Source Stone was equally as useful to the White Deer.

What if it made a move on Huang Xiaolong?

The notion did indeed appear in its mind.

However, the White Deer decided against it. It could tell that Huang Xiaolong was in no way weaker than it. Moreover, he had the four Universe Origin Fires. It wouldn’t be possible for it to obtain it from Huang Xiaolong anyway.

After a short moment of hesitation, it asked, “I can trade you a little Universe Source Qi for the spiritual veins you handed over previously.”

“I don’t lack universe-level spiritual veins…”

“What do you want for some of the qi?! I have a lot of treasures from all my years of existence. Even though they aren’t as precious as the Universe Source Stone, they’re comparable to your spiritual veins”!

As if it was afraid that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t agree, it quickly retrieved a spatial artifact and revealed its contents. Yang Dingsheng cried out loud when he saw what was contained within.

“Golden Dragon Core!”

“Heavenly Phoenix Flower!”

…

The treasures that could hardly be found in the outside world were piled high into a mountain.

Huang Xiaolong remained completely indifferent when he looked at the pile of treasures. “I have no need for any of those. However, I can agree to give you a little universe source qi if you agree to my conditions.”

“What are they?!”

“Be my mount,” Huang Xiaolong explained.

“What?!” You!” A flash of rage crossed the White Deer’s eyes. It glared at Huang Xiaolong with the intention to kill the filthy human before it. After all, that request was nothing more than a way to humiliate the White Deer.

The White Deer was the master of the White Deer Cave, and it was one of the peak existences in the Thirteen Universes. Not even the Black Nether King would dare to come up with a condition like that!

Yang Dingsheng sucked in a cold breath as he didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would bring up such an outrageous condition.

Wasn’t that a little…

“There’s no need to look at me like that,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “You can disagree if you like. However, it’s only a matter of time before I surpass the Black Nether King.”

Huang Xiaolong used the Universe Origin Fires to melt away layers upon layers of ice after he spoke. Very quickly, he disappeared into the hole he created.

The White Deer felt its rage dissipating as it looked into the bottomless hole created by Huang Xiaolong.

As for Yang Dingsheng, he didn’t think too much about it. He spoke to the White Deer, “Lord White Deer, you can ignore whatever he said. He didn’t mean to offend you.”

The White Deer ignored him completely.

Seeing the creature’s reaction, Yang Dingsheng felt a wave of anxiousness rising in his heart.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to penetrate several thousand feet into the ice. The deeper he went, the harder it became to melt the ice. As such, he had to slow down a little.

After half an hour, he finally reached the ten thousand feet mark.

As he traveled closer to the Universe Source Stone, a figure emerged outside the wall of ice. There was a holy aura surrounding his body, and his bloodline pulsated with the strength of the oldest bloodline in the Thirteen Universes.

“White Feather King!”

The person who came was precisely the White Feather King of the Universe First Race.

The White Deer was equally as shocked to discover his presence.

The White Feather King glanced at Yang Dingsheng before turning to look at the White Deer. He evidently didn’t expect to see the White Deer and grinned, “White Deer, are you also here for the Universe Source Stone?”

The White Deer stared at the item in the White Feather King’s hand and gasped in shock. Was that how he located the Universe Source Stone?!

Perhaps it was how the Universe First Race obtained the first piece of Universe Source Stone in the past.

Even though the White Deer had no idea what the round plate-like item in his hand was, it could tell that there was a special type of energy coming from it.

“White Feather King, your Universe First Race is bound to be disappointed this time.” The White Deer sneered, “Even if you managed to locate this place, you won’t be able to grab the Universe Source Stone.”

In the past, the Universe First Race sealed off the White Deer Cave in order to capture the White Deer and it had been holding a grudge ever since.

A frown formed on the White Feather King’s face when he saw the wall of Black Source Ice. The White Deer wasn’t any weaker than it, but it failed to shatter the Black Source Ice! There was no way he could do the same.

However, he could feel a wave of energy coming from deep within the wall of ice.

Could it be?!

Universe Origin Fire?!

There was only one treasure in the universes that could melt the Black Source Ice!

“Huang Xiaolong?!” The White Feather King guessed the identity of the person in the Black Source Ice immediately. Huang Xiaolong’s possession of the Universe Origin Fires was no secret.

When he learned who it was, a sinister laugh escaped his lips. “Little White Deer, Huang Xiaolong probably entered the wall of Black Source Ice… Looks like the heavens are helping my race! I might not be able to obtain the Universe Source Stone myself, but someone is bringing it out for me!”

According to what the White Feather King knew, Huang Xiaolong was stuck at the 27 billion mark. When Huang Xiaolong emerged with the Universe Source Stone, he would snatch it away from the kid!

As for the White Deer, he didn’t think too much about it. He brought a special treasure refined by the Black Nether King in order to suppress the White Deer. When that happened, the White Deer wouldn’t be able to stop him!
