Chapter 3388: Eastern World

 

Even though the Myriad Treasures Dao Master, Golden Spirit Goddess, Tortoise Spirit Goddess, and the Wudang Goddess should be present during the gathering, Huang Xiaolong planned to track down the Myriad Treasures Dao Master. There was still a month before the gathering. Huang Xiaolong wondered if he could get the locations of the three women from the Myriad Treasures Dao Master.

Since he had nothing better to do, it wouldn’t hurt if he did something.

If he could obtain the location of the Heaven Piercing Sage, that would be great.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Senior Huang, are you really planning to go to the Western Niuhe Continent?” Mu Shuihan was stunned when he heard the news. He thought that Huang Xiaolong only planned to leave after the Gathering of the Immortal Peaches.

“Yeah. I’ll leave in a bit.”

As the distance between the Dongsheng God Continent and the Western Niuhe Continent was the shortest out of the other continents, Huang Xiaolong planned to head there first. As for the Northern Julu Continent, it was the furthest. He would head over to look for the Myriad Treasures Dao Master before the two goddesses.

“Relax. Before I leave, I will lay down a formation. As long as you remain within the formation, no harm will befall you.” Huang Xiaolong understood their concerns. Even if Mu Shuihan didn’t say anything, Huang Xiaolong was already planning to lay down the formation.

A look of joy appeared on Mu Shuihan’s face as he thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely.

“Alright. Get up.” Huang Xiaolong got to his feet too. “Let’s go. You should watch me carefully when I lay down the formation. You might be able to discover many things.”

Naturally, it was extremely effective for anyone to watch Huang Xiaolong at work. After all, he had surpassed the God of Formations level back in the Blazing Dragon World. 

Mu Shuihan thanked Huang Xiaolong once again.

With a single step, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the top of the mountain. 

As he pointed at various locations around the air, the law of formations seemed to fuse with the grand dao laws. They surrounded the entire mountain in an instant.

In order to let Mu Shuihan understand what he was doing, Huang Xiaolong’s movements were extremely slow. He emphasized every move, and he seemed like someone writing calligraphy in the air.

Half an hour passed and Huang Xiaolong finally stopped.

“Senior Huang, is the formation done?!” Mu Shuihan couldn’t help but ask when he saw that Huang Xiaolong had already stopped.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Even if every single sage worked together, they wouldn’t be able to do a thing to the Shushan Immortal Gate.” In fact, even if the Combined Dao Ancestor arrived, he wouldn’t be able to cause the protective barrier to tremble. However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t tell Mu Shuihan that.

With his current understanding of the art of formations, any random formation he laid down contained a terrifying amount of power. No ordinary Combined Dao Ancestor would be able to shatter it.

Mu Shuihan felt the world spinning around him when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Several moments later, Huang Xiaolong saw Yan Bao’er and Liu Huang. He rubbed Yan Bao’er’s head affectionately and chuckled, “Remember to cultivate diligently!” Under the respectful gazes of Mu Shuihan and the other experts of the Shushan Immortal Gate, Huang Xiaolong left. His figure disappeared on the horizon in an instant.

When he left, Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop. He left the Dongsheng God Continent in a single day as he entered the Western Niuhe Continent.

As soon as he entered, Huang Xiaolong discovered a ton of people who cultivated the Buddhist arts. In the Dongsheng God Continent, he was barely able to find any. However, almost everyone in the Western Niuhe Continent was a cultivator of the Buddhist arts.

One could only imagine the influence of the Western Buddhist factions.

The Immortal World in the Pangu World was large. It was several times larger than the holy worlds in the Huang Long World! The size of the continents was extremely massive, and the Western Buddhist factions had to be terrifyingly strong if they could influence an entire continent!

The reason the Heavenly Court Emperor was afraid of Buddha Rulai also had something to do with their influence!

When Huang Xiaolong entered the continent, he left straight for the Myriad Buddha World.

There were countless Buddhist ancestors there, and all of them managed to open a heavenly kingdom on their own. The Maitreya Buddha’s Heavenly Kingdom was called the Maitreya Buddha World, and he was dubbed the King of Buddhas as a result.

Maitreya’s position in the Western Continent was extremely high, and he was comparable to Sakyamuni and Dipamkara. They were second only to Buddha Rulai.

When Huang Xiaolong passed one of the immortal kingdoms, he noticed a huge group of cultivators rushing somewhere.

It seemed as though they were rushing towards the Myriad Buddha World, and Huang Xiaolong quickly stopped one of them to ask about the situation.

The cultivator he stopped was extremely handsome, and he had a long sword hanging from his back. As he looked at Huang Xiaolong, he gasped in shock, “Dao friend, you don’t seem to be native to the Western Niuhe Continent.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

“It’s no wonder. Today, the Golden Brow Arhat will be holding a lecture. It’s an extremely rare opportunity for all of us! The Golden Brow Arhat barely leaves the Myriad Buddha World, and everyone is rushing to hear his lecture!”

“Oh? Golden Brow Arhat?” Huang Xiaolong felt his heart trembling slightly. “He seems to be a disciple of the Maitreya Buddha.”

The other party laughed, “Seems to be?! My friend, the Golden Brow Arhat is the sixth disciple of the Maitreya Buddha!”

“I heard that the Maitreya Buddha’s favorite disciple, Yang Kai, was slain by someone recently.”

“?! I wonder who did it. They are really too damn crazy! Who would have thought that someone would be mad enough to kill a disciple of the Maitreya Buddha!”

The warrior with a sword on his back shook his head slightly.

“I killed Yang Kai,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Staring at him in shock, the warrior with a sword on his back started to laugh. Patting Huang Xiaolong on the shoulders, he sighed, “Brother, you’re a pretty interesting person. How can I address you?” 

It was clear he didn’t believe anything Huang Xiaolong said.

Indeed. No one would expect to run into a random guy on the street and believe that they had the ability to kill Immortal Emperor Yang Kai.

“Huang Xiaolong,” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to hide his identity.

“Brother Huang.” Cupping his fists, the warrior introduced himself, “I am Eminent Elder Huang Xiaochun of the Azure Sword Immortal Gate. What a coincidence! There’s only a single-word difference in our names! Those who don’t know might think that we are brothers!”

“Huang Xiaochun?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. “A coincidence indeed.”

The world was too damn big and Huang Xiaolong soon recovered from his shock. It wasn’t weird for someone to possess the same name as him.

“I wonder where Brother Huang is headed?” Huang Xiaochun asked.

“I’m looking for someone in the Myriad Buddha World.” 

“Perfect. We can go together! Traveling with a friend is much better than traveling alone,” Huang Xiaochun suggested.

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slightly and chuckled.

As there wouldn’t be much distance to cover, he didn’t mind traveling with Huang Xiaochun.

“Who are you looking for?” along the way, Huang Xiaochun asked.

“I’m looking for the Myriad Treasures Dao Master.” 

Staring at Huang Xiaolong in shock, he continued, “Don’t tell me you’re looking for the disciple of the Heaven Piercing Sage...”
