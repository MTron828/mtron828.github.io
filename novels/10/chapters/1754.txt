While Zhao Lei, Fang Mingyu, and the others were still in shock, Huang Xiaolong had already led them out of prison.

After they arrived at the main palace, Li Shan and Chen Yirong had already cleaned up the battle. They did such a good job that no one would have guessed that a fierce battle had taken place.

They had even restored the walls that had collapsed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head inwardly at their efficiency.

Upon seeing Huang Xiaolong’s return, the two of them hastily went up to greet him. The smile on their faces possessed the brilliance of a thousand suns, “Young Hero Huang, you’re finally back!”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had left for the Fortune Emperor Palace’s prison, they couldn’t dare to take a step out of the palace before Huang Xiaolong gave them his permission.

Zhao Lei and Fang Mingyu felt their jaws dropping to the ground when they saw how Li Shan and Chen Yirong acted like slaves and bowed down to Huang Xiaolong.

“Pretty nice job here.” Huang Xiaolong nodded in approval, “Did everyone take the oath?”

“There are no exceptions; every single disciple who witnessed the battle made the oath before us.” Li Shan and Chen Yirong answered in unison, and both rushed to ask, “Does Young Hero Huang have any other instructions?”

Zhao Lei and the rest of them were stunned speechless.

Huang Xiaolong replied, “Detain all the disciples from the Snow Moon Hall and lock them in the Fortune Emperor Palace prison. Kill all who resist, especially Yan Ying. Do not allow her to escape.”

“Young Hero Huang, please be at ease. We have already ordered some people to keep an eye on Yan Ying for some time. We will personally make a move to detain everyone from the Snow Moon Hall now.” Li Shan stammered.

“Young Hero Huang, should we activate our Fortune Array and stop everyone from leaving? I’m afraid some of Zhou Chen’s accomplices would take advantage of the chaos to run away...” Chen Yirong asked.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Chen Yirong and thought about it for a second. “Send the orders down to activate the Fortune Array and temporarily stop everyone from leaving. If they refuse to listen to you, treat them as Zhou Chen’s accomplice, and handle them accordingly.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After passing down several more orders, he dismissed them.

Looking at Li Shan and Chen Yirong leaving happily, Zhao Lei and Chen Hao opened their mouths like goldfishes trying to breathe as if they were in a dream.

Night...

Huang Xiaolong stood on top of his room’s roof inside of the Fortune Divine Kingdom and felt the wind brush against him.

The night was extremely tranquil, yet Huang Xiaolong’s heart was in a turmoil.

As the Battle of the Heavenly Court approached, Huang Xiaolong had a myriad of thoughts, and there was an uneasy feeling blooming in his heart.

Even though Zhou Chen did not know the identity of the mysterious Great Lord, Huang Xiaolong had faintly guessed something from their conversions.

There weren’t many people that were able to make a late-Tenth Order Emperor work for them. This type of strength and power was something out of the scope of the Fiend God Emperor Palace.

Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe!

Only the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe held this type of power.

Moreover, from Zhou Chen and the Great Lord’s conversation, the Great Lord was planning to conspire against the Divine World. It was extremely obvious to Huang Xiaolong that the Great Lord they talked about was the Nine Yin Old Ancestor, Shi Ming!

The disappearance of the dozens of Emperors recently definitely had something to do with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

The strength and influence of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had already exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s imagination.

If Zhou Chen was a spy planted by the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, they definitely had many more spies in the various Emperor Palaces in the Divine World. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be possible for so many Emperors to disappear out of the blue.

It was even possible that they had planted a spy in the Grandmist Emperor Palace.

I’m afraid that the palaces where the Emperors disappeared may have already fallen under the control of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. It seems like they are finally running out of patience!

However, there should be two to three thousand years before they fully executed their plan from the conversation between Zhou Chen and Shi Ming. Could it be that they have brought forward their plan?Is it because of my appearance as the King of Hell?

Just as Huang Xiaolong was thinking about the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, he caught a whiff of fragrance as Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao arrived behind him.

“What are you thinking about?” Fang Xuanxuan asked curiously.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “I’m thinking about the disappearance of Uncle Fang and the rest of the Emperors.”

The two girls were dazed.

“Are you implying that the power behind Zhou Chen might have done it?” Peng Xiao asked in surprise.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and then shared his thoughts with them.

“Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe!” The two of their faces changed when they heard that it might be related to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. Of course, no one could remain calm when the words ‘Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’ were mentioned.

“Then my father, he...” Fang Xuanxuan blurted out immediately.

“Don’t worry. I will contact Xiaomei and ask the Silver Fox Commerce to help look for Uncle Fang.” Huang Xiaolong comforted and sighed immediately after, “However, I’m afraid that from now on, the Divine World is about to fall into chaos.”

Once the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe activated their plan, blood rivers would flow in the Divine World. Many Emperor Palaces would probably cease to exist.

However, this wasn’t something that Huang Xiaolong was able to stop. At the very least, he wouldn’t be able to stop it unless he had the strength to kill Shi Ming.

“Xiaolong, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe won’t give up just because Zhou Chen is dead.” Peng Xiao said. When she thought about how the Fortune Emperor Palace would be the target of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, she felt a tingling sensation on her scalp.

“That’s even better.” Huang Xiaolong smiled indifferently, “I’m still afraid that the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe won’t come to me.”

He had meant what he said. He wasn’t afraid of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe messing with him. As long as Shi Ming didn’t personally appear, he was confident of making the Divine World a resting place for everyone that came.

However, even Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen were killed in the battle. The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe wouldn’t be stupid enough to provoke the Fortune Emperor Palace again. At least, until their plan fully started.

Four days passed in a blink of an eye.

During these four days, the Fortune Emperor Palace was cleaned from top to bottom, and all the disciples from the Snow Moon Hall were captured and thrown into prison. Even Yan Ying couldn’t escape.

After the operation, Huang Xiaolong allowed Fang Mingyu and Zhao Lei to take charge of the situation in the Fortune Emperor Palace. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to manage it and was more than happy to take a break finally.

After another ten or so more days, Huang Xiaolong finally started to prepare to head over to the Heavenly Court.

In the past, Fang Gan and Zhou Chen had always led the party participating in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. However, now that Fang Gan was missing and Huang Xiaolong had killed Zhou Chen, Zhao Lei and Li Shan were placed in charge of escorting all the disciples to the Heavenly Court.

Chen Yirong was tasked to watch over the Fortune Emperor Palace and Fang Mingyu, who had no intention to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

For the sake of their safety, Huang Xiaolong ordered two of the four odd beasts to stay behind and take care of the Fortune Emperor Palace. With their protection, no one would be able to attack the Fortune Emperor Palace.

On a fine and sunny day, Huang Xiaolong stood on the Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s deck and looked in the Heavenly Court’s direction.

“Let’s move out!”
