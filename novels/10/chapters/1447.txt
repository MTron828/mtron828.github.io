Walking out from his room, Huang Xiaolong gathered everyone in the hall and asked them to wait for him inside the Edge of the World Manor while he participated in the rankings competition.

The rankings competition was estimated to take at least three months.

Three months’ time was neither long nor short. So Huang Xiaolong did not want any accidents during this period since they had not established any footing in the Fortune Emperor Palace. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After hearing Huang Xiaolong instructed everyone to stay inside the residence, the little cow raised a hoof and scratched her ear. “I know, I know, just go in peace, but let me say this, during the rankings competition,don’t hold back, and you must get first place. That way, it would be more convenient for us to move around in the future.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement.

Even if he decided to conceal his supreme godheads, he needed to win first place in the rankings competition.

Getting first place in the rankings competition would increase his chances of being taken as a personal disciple by one of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s higher echelons. With that level of identity, it would be much more convenient for Huang Xiaolong to move around the Fortune Emperor Palace, especially when he went back to the Vientiane World or the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield to look for the Tianwu Treasure.

Furthermore, he still planned to search for the Blood Eye Devil Stele’s lower half.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest sent Huang Xiaolong off. With that he turned and flew away from the Crimson Crescent City in the direction of the Supreme Harmony Hall.

Roughly half a month later, exactly one day before the day of the rankings competition, Huang Xiaolong reached the Supreme Harmony Hall.

Soon after reaching the Supreme Harmony Hall, Huang Xiaolong spotted the inner sect disciple He Lai who had led him there for the first time. He Lai smiled when he saw Huang Xiaolong. He came over and said, “Junior Brother Huang, congratulations on passing the enrollment. The rankings competition starts tomorrow, so let me wish Junior Brother Huang good luck in advance. I hope Junior Brother Huang enters the top one hundred.”

He Lai and the inner sect disciple in charge of the enrollment assessment Luo Yun were on good terms. Therefore, some time back, He Lai had learned from Luo Yun some details about Huang Xiaolong’s enrollment assessment and knew that Elder Bai looked favorably at Huang Xiaolong. Therefore, He Lai was very polite to Huang Xiaolong, and his earlier superiority was nowhere to be seen.

Huang Xiaolong smiled as he responded, “Many thanks, Senior Brother He, I’ll borrow Senior Brother He’s good wishes, and I would strive my very best to enter the top one hundred.” Inwardly, Huang Xiaolong was feeling somewhat bitter. Luo Yun was certain that he could enter the top one hundred and now He Lai thought the same. ...Could it be that he was only capable of entering the top one hundred?

He Lai spoke smilingly, “After Junior Brother Huang finishes the rankings competition, you must come visit me at my cultivation palace.” He warmly invited Huang Xiaolong.

He Lai was an inner sect disciple with a backing, and this was one of the reasons he had a private cultivation palace.

Huang Xiaolong agreed crisply, “For sure.”

He Lai and Huang Xiaolong exchanged a few more perfunctory words before separating as each of them headed off in different directions.

As the ranking competition was going to start the next day, Huang Xiaolong and the other disciples, who had reached the Supreme Harmony Hall early, sat cross-legged to meditate on the square opposite to the competition arena while waiting for time to pass.

As Huang Xiaolong sat down, he swept his gaze over the square. Other disciples meditating on the square were of various strengths, both weak and strong. The majority of them were between Fifth Order to Sixth Order Ancestor God Realm. Some were Seventh, Eighth, or Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm, and only a handful of them were Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm and above.

However, the strongest among these disciples was merely a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. Looks like the two God King Realm disciples, Liu Qin and Fu Feiyun, mentioned by Luo Yun hadn’t arrived yet.

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong sensed a cold gaze on him. He turned to look and saw Zhou Wen glaring coldly at him.

Zhou Wen had endured his bitter feelings for Huang Xiaolong for half a year, and it looked like Zhou Wen was not going to let him go in the rankings competition.

“Punk, tomorrow, I will make you understand what is the difference between hell and heaven!” Zhou Wen mouthed when he saw Huang Xiaolong looking at him.

Zhou Wen used voice transmission, so the other disciples wouldn’t know what had transpired between him and Huang Xiaolong

Huang Xiaolong replied nonchalantly via voice transmission. “I will teach you who’s your father, and your ancestor!”

Who’s your father!

Who’s your ancestor!

Fury erupted in Zhou Wen’s eyes and he leaped into the air abruptly. His sudden movement alarmed the nearby meditating disciples and they scattered away like frightened birds.

However,Huang Xiaolong remained blase as he sat meditating, even though Zhou Wen was about to attack him suddenly.

Zhou Wen was momentarily baffled by Huang Xiaolong’s inaction but a sneer soon rose up his face. “Not bad, you’ve got some strength. That’s better, or the rankings competition would be a little bland.”

Huang Xiaolong remained aloof.

Then, the disciples stirred again.

Both Huang Xiaolong and Zhou Wen turned to look at the same time and saw two young men flying side-by-side towards the Supreme Harmony Hall. Both of these men had an extraordinary bearing, seemingly enshrouded in divine halos.

These two young men were God King Realm masters!

Huang Xiaolong immediately knew that these two young men were Liu Qin and Fu Feiyu, whom Luo Yun had mentioned before.

The one with slightly feminine features should be the disciple from the Unparalleled branch, the early First Order God King Realm Liu Qin; while the other young man breathing masculinity with thick, sword-shaped brows must be Fu Feiyu from the Eternal Zephyr branch.

As expected, when the two young men descended, many other branches’ disciples went up to greet them.

“Hello, Senior Brother Liu!”

“Hello, Senior Brother Fu!”

The smiles on these disciples’ faces bore a hint of flattery.

Liu Qin nodded proudly, appearing haughty, whereas Fu Feiyu seemed more approachable as he nodded politely to everyone who greeted him. Though he seemed friendly, Huang Xiaolong detected disdain in the depth of his eyes as he looked at these disciples who were trying to flatter him.

But this was normal. Though both of them weren’t supreme godhead geniuses, their godheads were still top emperor rank godheads, placing their talents infinitely close to supreme godhead geniuses. On top of that, both of them had already broken through to God King Realm, therefore if there was no accident in between, they were almost certain of entering the top three places in the rankings competition. At that time, they would be accepted as personal disciples by Hall Masters. So their disdain towards other disciples was simply a human nature.

Like other disciples, Zhou Wen also went up to Liu Qin and Fu Feiyu.

“Senior Brother Liu.” Zhou Wen greeted him as he got closer to Liu Qin’s side, and his demeanor was filled with utmost respect. Judging from their expressions, the two seemed familiar with each other.

Liu Qin smiled a little at Zhou Wen as he said, “Junior Brother Zhou, no need to be so polite. Moreover, based on Junior Brother Zhou’s talent and strength, by the time the rankings competition ends, Junior Brother Zhou would surely be accepted by a Hall Master as a personal disciple. In the future, we are going to be brothers, so we should hang out together more often.”

As Liu Qin was slightly more feminine in his words and behavior, his ‘hang out together more often’ sent goosebumps down some disciples’ neck. Zhou Wen, however, looked absolutely delighted.

“Is that Huang Xiaolong?” Liu Qin’s gaze swept around the square and stopped on Huang Xiaolong. As all the other disciples on the square had gone up to greet him, Liu Qin made Huang Xiaolong stand out like a sore thumb.

Zhou Wen smiled as he confirmed, “That’s him.”

Liu Qin slightly raised his chin and said, “Indeed, he is someone without manners. People like this should be educated.” The underlying meaning was that Huang Xiaolong was someone who needed to learn manners as he had not greeted them like the others.

Judging from Liu Qin’s tone, it also looked like he knew about the conflict between Huang Xiaolong and Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen chuckled, “Senior Brother Liu is right. Just now, I exerted some pressure over him but he was unaffected, so it looks like his strength is not bad.”

Liu Qin laughed at his words, “Merely a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm—it cannot be even counted as significant strength. My pinky alone can shatter him to pieces.”
