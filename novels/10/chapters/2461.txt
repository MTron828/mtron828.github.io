Chapter 2462: Because He Pleases My Eyes

R-rrummm-ble-ee!

It was as if the sky was eclipsed. Every single expert within the Mirage Pavilion felt their hearts, and even their souls, trembling in sync with the ear-splitting rumbles.

The thunderous collision resounded endlessly in high air.

Before the Vajra Race Patriarch Jin Nu’s, Devil Palace’s Xie Bufan’s, Dou Rui’s, Holy Heaven’s Li Chen’s, and the others’ eyes, Jin Taiji staggered back one too many times after the collision. With each backward step, his body swayed unsteadily, and his feet left clear indents on the stage floor. Each step was a loud thump on the stage.

Jin Taiji retreated until the edge of the battle stage, and the breath he was holding, choked out with a mouthful of blood.

Lost!

Despite having the Chaos Hollow Saint Godhead, the Vajra Indestructible Saint Physique, the Sky Dragon Sacred Elephant Saint Bloodline, and having mastered the Great Crossing Palms, Jin Taiji still failed to withstand one strike from Huang Xiaolong’s Prosperity of the Dragons!

Moments ago, the Vajra Race’s disciples were loudly calling out to Jin Taiji, telling him that he shouldn’t show mercy to Huang Xiaolong by attacking him at full force. They wanted Huang Xiaolong to roll off the battle stage in shame. But, at this moment, there seemed to be an invisible hand choking their throats. These disciples’ faces were red, and they could not utter a word. Whereas, the Devil Palace’s Dou Rui and other disciples looked like the cat got their tongues.

Li Chen’s face fell after watching the result. Even Jin Taiji had lost despite having the Chaos Hollow Saint Godhead, and cultivating the Great Crossing Palms. Then, was there any one below the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint, who could defeat Huang Xiaolong ?

It was unless a monstrous genius with a complete dao saint godhead in the top ten ranks appeared.

But, was that possible?

Jin Taiji was a little crestfallen after being pushed back by Huang Xiaolong, and he cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Your Highness’ talent is unparalleled. I lost, and I admit defeat. You can take my life or whatever, I’ll accept it willingly!”

Before he had stepped on to the battle stage, he had thought of what might be the final outcome. Although he had confidence in his own strength, and had thought the chances of ending up in the worst kind of situation was very slim, he, Jin Taiji, was not someone who could not afford to lose.

He was aware that the result wouldn’t change even if he persisted to continue fighting, so he straightforwardly admitted defeat.

While Jin Taiji, the Vajra Race experts, and others thought that Huang Xiaolong would treat Jin Taiji the same way he had treated all his opponents so far, Huang Xiaolong smiled casually and said, “Why would I want to kill you? Go on, get off the stage.”

“Leave?” Jin Taiji and the rest had not expected this.

Since all previous challengers had died miserably, the crowd had not expected that Huang Xiaolong would let Jin Taiji go.

Huang Xiaolong grinned, “According to the rules we’ve set, anyone who admits defeat can leave the battle stage. Since you’ve already thrown in the towel, you can go. But, you need to leave something behind.” With that said, Huang Xiaolong’s palm reached out, and lightly tapped Jin Taiji’s chest, removing something that resembled a heart-protecting mirror.

The heart-protecting mirror on Jin Taiji’s chest was not some average artifact. If Huang Xiaolong had guessed correctly, this heart-protecting mirror was the Vajra Race’s saint artifact, Vajra Mirror, that could both defend and attack. It could also expel heart demons, and it had many other wonderful uses.

Although Huang Xiaolong had mainly spared Jin Taiji’s life because of his master Tyrant Chu, Jin Taiji had challenged him on the battle stage. Hence, Huang Xiaolong naturally needed to collect a trophy.

Jin Taiji blanked for a second, seeing that Huang Xiaolong had taken away his Vajra Mirror, but he cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong gratefully. “I thank Your Highness for showing mercy. I’ll pay my respects again in the future!” With that, he quickly leaped off the stage.

When Jin Taiji returned safely by his side, the Vajra Race Patriarch Jin Nu also cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong and said gratefully, “I am indebted to Your Highness’ magnanimity!”

Compared to Jin Taiji’s life, the loss of a mere Vajra Mirror was inconsequential.

Huang Xiaolong cupped his fists, returning the salute, “Patriarch Jin Nu is being too polite.”

The various forces had different reactions, seeing this result. Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Zhang Zhiyuan, and the other thirty-nine forces were raging with fury. After all, Huang Xiaolong was merciless when he had battled Fang Xing, Sui Yunfeng, and the others on the battle stage, and Huang Xiaolong had taken the lives of more than sixty disciples from each force.

For a second, Shen jiewen failed to rein in his hatred and spoke out, “Huang Xiaolong, your actions are unfair! On what basis is Jin Taiji leaving the stage alive when the disciples of our holy grounds were all killed?!”

Huang Xiaolong snickered in disdain at Shen Jiewen’s outburst, “On what basis? Based on the fact that he pleases my eyes, why? Do I still have to explain my reason?”

Shen Jiewen’s face turned purple at Huang Xiaolong’s answer.

The others shook their heads inwardly, as a similar thought crossed their minds becauseShen Jiewen’s question was absurd.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t violated the stipulated rules at all. Therefore, it wasn’t Shen Jiewen’s place to comment on, or question how Huang Xiaolong went about things.

In the end, Shen Jiewen swallowed the rest of his words.

After the match with Jin Taiji, a peaceful six days went by. None of the holy grounds or ancient races challenged Huang Xiaolong.

“I heard the other eight of the Holy Lands Alliance’s top ten holy grounds have arrived!” Dou Rui informed Xie Bufan.

“They’re here? Why didn’t they come to challenge Huang Xiaolong?” One of the Devil Palace’s elders asked when he heard Dou Rui’s words.

“Of course it’s because they are scared. Originally, everyone had assumed that Huang Xiaolong’s two complete dao saint godheads were in the top thirty at the most. Therefore, they had thought that there was a chance of defeating Huang Xiaolong, but now, it’s not a secret that Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads are the Dual-Headed Giant Dragon Saint Godhead and All-Bodhisattvas Saint Godhead. In this case, do you think the Nine Plains Holy Ground and the rest would dare to send their disciples up to die?” Xie Bufan sneered coldly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Dou Rui looked at the way Huang Xiaolong was sitting leisurely on the battle stage, and anger suddenly rose in his chest, “Look at Huang Xiaolong, that punk, on the battle stage. I wish I could tear him to pieces with my bare hands! Are we going to let him continue swaggering on the stage?”

Xie Bufan sighed, “I reported this matter to the Palace Master in the hopes that he would send She Wuzui over to deal with Huang Xiaolong. But the Palace Master is reluctant to expose She Wuzui, as he is afraid that She Wuzui would be hurt. Therefore, we can only think of a way to finish Huang Xiaolong during the Trial of Blood!”

At the mention of She Wuzui, Dou Rui, and the others nodded inwardly. She Wuzui was pinned as the second Xie Bufan by the Devil Palace’s higher echelons. He was a disciple with amazing talent, and because of his short cultivation time, She Wuzui was not included in the group of Devil Palace’s Six Devil’s Sons.

“Then, let Huang Xiaolong live a few more days.” Dou Rui fumed as he glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong’s figure on the battle stage, “At the time of the Trial of Blood at the Ghost Devil City, I personally want to twist Huang Xiaolong’s head off from his shoulders!”

The Trial of Blood permitted any disciple with one hundred thousand years of bone-age to participate, and Dou Rui fitted this participation requirement.

Xie Bufan nodded, “It is our best shot to kill Huang Xiaolong in the coming Trial of Blood, but if we miss it, we will be letting Huang Xiaolong continue to grow stronger. If that happens, then it will be harder for us to kill him. Therefore, once he enters the Ghost Devil City, we absolutely must not let him come out alive!”

Dou Rui snickered, “Rest assured, Senior Brother Bufan. No matter how talented Huang Xiaolong is, how is he even our opponent? The Trial of Blood would be marked as his death anniversary!”

“But, the Ghost Talisman Holy Ground and Holy Race will be arriving in a few days. I wonder if they would challenge Huang Xiaolong.” A Devil Palace’s hall master wondered aloud.

“It is said that both the Ghost Talisman Holy Ground and Holy Race are adamant to win the grandmist holy spiritual aura, and the Ghost Talisman Holy Ground even let the word out that regardless of Huang Xiaolong’s talent, they are going to challenge him!” Said another Devil Palace’s hall master.

“Oh, in that case, it seems like the Ghost Talisman Holy Ground and Holy Race are very confident about defeating Huang Xiaolong?!” Xie Bufan said with a glimmer of interest.

“Probably, but it’s hard to say. Who knows if Huang Xiaolong has hidden his strength.”
