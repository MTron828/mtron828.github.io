Brutality flashed across Guo Gang’s face as he watched his guards rushing towards Huang Xiaolong and Luo Yunjie. Although Guo Gang knew that things would get a little troublesome if he crippled Huang Xiaolong and Luo Yunjie, as Fortune Gate would not let this matter slide, he was still confident that the Fortune Gate would not dare to harm him.

The Guo Family was one of the top twelve prominent sea tribe families. On top of that, his Eldest Uncle was the Guo Family’s Patriarch, and his Grandfather had been the previous Guo Family Patriarch as well as a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm master. In this Vientiane World, there wasn’t a person he was afraid of.

Just as the guards reached Huang Xiaolong and Luo Yunjie, all of a sudden, more than a dozen Nefarious Devil experts appeared beside them; nefarious qi soared to the sky.

These Nefarious Devil experts’ enormous palms slapped at the guards, and in the next moment, bodies flew and undulating screams reverberated in the air.

These guards were quick to rush at Huang Xiaolong and Luo Yunjie, thus they were knocked away even faster. A few of the guards got rammed into Guo Gang, and he too was knocked tumbling backward as he was caught off guard.

The changes were too abrupt that the crowd was shocked, including Luo Yunjie as well.

Guo Gang’s guards crashed to the ground here and there, and most of them were heaving out air rather than breathing it in, apparently, it looked like they would stop breathing in the next second.

Guo Gang had Guo Jin backing him, thus Huang Xiaolong decided not to kill him right away, however, those guards were a completely different story and Huang Xiaolong had ordered Xie Li and other Nefarious Devils to kill all of them except Guo Gang.

Guo Gang pushed away the guard who had knocked into him, and got up from the ground in a fury; a startling amount of killing intent was roiling in his frosty blue eyes.

This was the first time someone had dared to hit him!

"Huang Xiaolong!" Guo Gang gritted his teeth through every word, his face distorted with anger. "You are dead, you will die miserably, not even your Masters Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor can save you now!’

"No one in this Vientiane World can save you!" Guo Gang’s words reverberated in the air.

Zhou Xu who had retreated far away was surprised by the presence of the Nefarious Devil experts, but he still gloated silently at this scene. Although there were several Nefarious Devil experts at Huang Xiaolong’s side to protect him, he was as good as dead for attacking Guo Gang.

Huang Xiaolong might not know Guo Gang’s identity, but Zhou Xu surely did.

The Guo Family behind Guo Gang was a giant force.

Huang Xiaolong was completely indifferent at Guo Gang’s words as he walked towards him.

"Huang Xiaolong, what do you want to do?!!" Guo Gang shouted. He was a little flustered when he saw Huang Xiaolong coming over. This was the first time he felt apprehensive.

Huang Xiaolong stood in front of Guo Gang flashing him a smile, and without a word, punched out a Great Void Divine Fist at Guo Gang’s chest.

Guo Gang howled like a dog as Huang Xiaolong’s fist struck his chest. Guo Gang felt like his chest had sunk in.

Even though Guo Gang was Guo Jin’s son, his talent was just a tad better than the common Fortune Gate genius disciples’. This was due to his lackadaisical attitude in his cultivation which had left Guo Gang’s foundation extremely wobbly. Even though with almost five hundred years of cultivation, it had only reached the peak of early Fourth Order Ancient God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong was about to land another punch on Guo Gang, when several powerful momentums rushed from the Golden Wheel City’s direction and appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong and the others in the blink of an eye.

The sea tribe’s experts!

Obviously, the situation here had alerted these sea tribe experts!

Each of these three sea tribe experts were exuding an overwhelming pressure, especially the tall old man in front; just a glance at him made others feel suffocated. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

An Ancestor God Realm master! The tall old man was surely an Ancestor God Realm master, and stronger than an average First Order Ancestor God Realm master, most likely a Second or Third Order, or even Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm master!

The crowd at the volcano area paled and trembled under the pressure of an Ancestor God Realm master.

“Young Master, are you alright?” The tall old man descended in front of Guo Gang. Before he could even answer, Guo Gang was lifted up by a gentle force. A blue glow enveloped Guo Gang and his injuries were healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Guo Gang beamed with joy when he saw the tall old man. He pointed at Huang Xiaolong and bellowed in fury, “Steward Qiao Fei, you came at the right time, kill that damn stray! Kill him!”

The tall old man was none other than Steward Qiao Fei, Guo Jin mansion’s steward.

Qiao Fei looked over his shoulder at Huang Xiaolong as if he was looking at a dead person. He had always executed Guo Gang’s orders without hesitation, even if the other side was a Fortune Gate disciple.

Qiao Fei’s momentum surged and became boundless and overwhelming to such an extent that it seemed like the sky had changed its color, even the movement in the volcanic crater halted temporarily. However, just as he was about to make a move, his actions paused as if he was respectfully listening to someone talking.

Then without a word, Qiao Fei swept up Guo Gangand disappeared in a flicker on the spot. The other two sea tribe experts also left following Qiao Fei, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

‘They left just like that?’

In the distance, Zhou Xu’s schadenfreude smile stiffened at this outcome.

In truth, Huang Xiaolong, Luo Yunjie, Li Lu and Wu Qian’er also didn’t expect this to happen.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said to Li Lu and she nodded in agreement.

However, before leaving, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell on Zhou Xu for a second. Zhou Xu’s heart palpitated feeling Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong left, the crowd of cultivators cheered.

Tan Lin arrived at Zhou Xu’s side while watching Huang Xiaolong’s figure, and coldly said, “I didn’t expectHuang Xiaolong’s luck to be so good that he was able to escape this disaster so easily.”

Zhou Xu pulled himself together and said coldly, “His good luck cannot follow him around for his entire life. Guo Gang is someone that holds grudges, and he’ll definitely think of a way to deal with Huang Xialong. It is impossible for Golden Brow and Blood Knife to be by his side at all times, hence he’s going to be dead sooner or later!”

On the other side, Huang Xiaolong’s group had just returned to the Golden Wheel City, and Huang Xiaolong was summoned by Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, Black Ice Ancestor, and Sky Sword Ancestor.

The moment Black Ice Ancestor saw Huang Xiaolong, she icily questioned right away, “Huang Xiaolong, does the Fortune Gate still exist in your eyes?! Do you still remember Fortune Gate’s rules?! Causing trouble everywhere you go, do you realize how big of a problem you have caused us this time?!” Her voice increased, “Why aren’t you on your knees and apologizing?!”

Kneel and apologize?

Huang Xiaolong knew that Black Ice Ancestor and other Ancestors were already aware about what had happened, and it was not his fault.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned cold.

At this moment, Blood Knife Ancestor’s lazy drawl could be heard, "Old hag Black Ice, Xiaolong is not your disciple, then what are you so much excited for? The two of us as his Masters haven’t said a word, and even if Xiaolong is to be punished you are not the one to make that decision."

Hearing Blood Knife Ancestor called her old hag, fury rose to Black Ice Ancestor’s face, "You—!"

"Enough," Golden Brow Ancestor broke off the two Ancestors’ argument, and added, " The fault of this matter is not on Xiaolong, as Guo Gang still did this despite knowing Xiaolong’s identity. Isn’t it like insulting the Fortune Gate on purpose? In fact, Xiaolong taught him a lesson to respect Fortune Gate, therefore, he should be praised."

Black Ice Ancestor snorted coldly, but did not speak in contradiction.

Sky Sword Ancestor said, “Merely Guo Jin is not an issue here, but the problem is the Guo Family who is backing him; it’s somewhat troublesome if they pursue this matter.”

Golden Brow Ancestor replied nonchalantly, “Just the Guo Family, and the Guo Family does not represent the entire sea tribes. Our Fortune Gate can’t be afraid of a mere Guo Family, right?”

Perhaps, there were only a scarce few people that dared to say so in the entire Vientiane World. This was domineering!
