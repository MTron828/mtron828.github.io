The first person to pass through the black hole was Gudu Leng, followed by Jiang Shaoze, Wang Biaoyuan, then the rest also made their way through.

Several breaths’ time later, Huang Xiaolong made his move. However, the actual passageway through the black hole was limited, moving at the same time as Huang Xiaolong were tens of thousands of other genius disciples.

Huang Xiaolong snorted. A burst of Asura qi was released from his body, hitting those disciples who were trying to squeeze into the black hole at the same time as him. From high above, several disciples dropped to the ground like dead locusts. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong pretended not to hear the angry shouts coming from below, flying straight into the black hole. Feeling like the universe flipped over, he fell out on the other side of the black hole.

Looking around, Huang Xiaolong saw that he appeared in a stone forest, with demonic beasts roars echoing endlessly in the distance.

The assessment deadline given was ten days. In these ten days, their results would be tallied according to the number of demonic beasts, monsters, and demons they killed.

Killing one early Tenth Order Saint realm brought 1 point, mid-stage would garner 5 points, while a late-Tenth Order Saint realm reaped 30 points. A peak-late Tenth Order Saint realm was 80 points, half-step God Realm was a high 300 points, and a peak half-step God Realm was 800 points. Then, the point gap widened further; an early First Order God Realm was 10,000 points, mid-First Order God Realm gave 50,000 points, and a late-First Order God Realm was a whopping 300,000 points!

Suddenly, a strange hair-raising shriek rang out, a multi-colored giant scorpion leaped onto Huang Xiaolong. Its enormous tail raised, with the poisonous stinger aimed at his throat.

Huang Xiaolong recognized this multi-colored scorpion, its poison was extremely toxic. Once stung, its poison could even corrode a peak half-step God Realm’s tough physique.

Huang Xiaolong scoffed looking at the multi-colored scorpion, grabbing its enormous tail with one hand almost immediately. Huang Xiaolong’s hand slightly shook and the giant scorpion’s body turned red. Barely half a second later, fire sparks shot out from its body, incinerating the scorpion from inside out, turning it into gray ash, scattered in the air.

After killing the multi-colored giant scorpion, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the palm-sized token he received during the registration flowed softly, as a thin golden line emerged on its surface. The dim token looked a little brighter than before.

When a hint of Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness submerged into the token, certain messages appeared in his mind.

[Huang Xiaolong, 300 points. Rank 957]

This was Huang Xiaolong’s current score and ranking. Which meant the multi-colored giant scorpion he had just killed was a half-step God Realm, hence 300 points. But, what he didn’t expect was that a several breaths’ delay in entering would affect his ranking so severely.

Other than information about his points and ranking, there was another list that appeared in his mind. This list was a roll of the top one hundred ranking board and their points.

First place, Gudu Leng-9,538 points.

Second place, Jiang Shaoze-7,694 points.

Third place, Wang Biaoyuan-7,562 points.

This was the current top three’s name and points on the board.

Gudu Leng was merely a few breaths’ time faster than Huang Xiaolong, but in the brief few breaths’ time, he had already accumulated more than 9,500 points! Huang Xiaolong was a little taken aback, but he wasn’t perturbed.

The assessment period was ten days, up to the very last day, the top ten places’ were subject to changes.

“Still, one shouldn’t lax too much.” Huang Xiaolong advised himself. Though the assessment had just begun, it wouldn’t do if he fell too far behind.

Huang Xiaolong opened his Eye of Hell and everything within a hundred thousand li entered in sight. None could hide.

“En, God Realm?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised.

Fifty thousand li from where he stood, a giant black bear tightened its palm, instantly crushing two genius disciples into pieces. Then, its wide mouth inhaled, sucking in a dozen other disciples closeby into its mouth, becoming food that filled its belly.

This black bear was an early First Order God Realm!

This made Huang Xiaolong excited instead of turning around and flee.

Oh, boy! The sun was shining on his first God Realm beast core.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sparkled brightly, releasing the Asura bloodline in his body and spreading out the Wings of Demon on his back. His figure disappeared from the stone forest almost instantaneously. A short while later, he appeared in the air above the black bear.

At this time, the black bear just caught another disciple, flinging the meal into its mouth, issuing loud crunching noises as it chewed the struggling disciple. A muffled blood-curdling scream could be heard before the disciple went totally quiet.

The remaining disciples in proximity stared wide-eyed in fear, their faces white as a sheet. All of them belonged to the same family, banding together as they passed through the black hole. Never did they imagine that they would drop right in front of a God Realm demonic beast. To these Saint realms and half-step God Realm disciples, a God Realm demonic beast was a terrifying nightmare in real life.

“It has been two hundred years since I tasted human flesh, this time, I must eat my fill!” The black bear’s pupils gleamed with bloodthirst as he turned towards the remaining disciples.

The shadow of death loomed over these disciples. Before a God Realm demonic beast, they lacked the ability to escape. As the black bear’s paws slammed down, a violent tremor ran through the ground.

It was at this point that Huang Xiaolong’s figure flickered, entering the black bear’s vision. His sudden appearance also dumbfounded the petrified disciples.

“Half-step God Realm?” The black bear took a glance at the human blocking its path and its lips curled back into a grin, “Heh, a death-seeking human.” Its paw swung forward, slapping down on Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong looked ahead with a frosty gaze, blocking the attack with a finger. The black bear’s huge palm was pinned in midair.

The frightened Saint realm disciples watched flabbergasted at this sudden reversal; the attack was stopped? The black bear’s huge palm was still locked in the same position, unable to advance an inch forward. Moreover, that young man merely used one finger!

Shock was evident on the black bear’s face.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained cold as a blinding light soared skyward from his finger. True essence fire lurked within the finger force, burning a hole right through the bear‘s paw. An abrupt force knocked the black bear off its feet.

When the black bear was knocked back, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette flickered in pursue. His palm was sharp as a knife as it slit across its throat. A hair-raising wail echoed in the air even as the black bear’s head flew into the sky.

Huang Xiaolong’s right hand curled slightly and a powerful force sucked a black ball of light out from the black bear’s head, falling into his right palm. The small black ball of light shook violently as it struggled and screamed, trying to escape. The little black ball of light was none other than the black bear’s soul.

Huang Xiaolong exerted more pressure and the black bear’s soul quickly stopped struggling, even its separated head and body stopped moving. He walked over to the black bear’s body, removing a fist-sized yellow beast core from its body in less than a second.

His first God Realm demonic beast core! Huang Xiaolong put the beast core into the Asura Ring, and as for the black bear’s body, he threw it into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, letting the Poison Corpse Scarabs deal with it.

Until Huang Xiaolong left their sight, the surviving Saint realm disciples barely regained their senses, each of them was agape with astonishment.

Killing a God Realm demonic beast in two moves?! On top of that, it didn’t even seem like the other side had gone all out.

“Who, who is this person?! Gudu Leng? No, he’s not Gudu Leng!”

“Scary, too scary! His strength is definitely more terrifying than Gudu Leng!”

Recovering from their traumatic shock, the surviving disciples began to guess Huang Xiaolong’s identity. Due to the Asura bloodline, his body was covered with a layer of Asura scales, unless it was someone familiar with Huang Xiaolong, no one could recognize him.

Three hours later and a few million miles away, a tiger-shaped demonic beast plummeted a long way down to the ground.

Huang Xiaolong’s right palm was like a sharp knife as it slashed across its body, removing the beast core within. This was Huang Xiaolong’s sixteenth God Realm demonic beast.

Even as he was putting the beast core away into the Asura Ring, Huang Xiaolong was frowning. He had already killed sixteen God Realm demonic beasts, but his ranking was still outside the top one hundred, unable to inch into the ranks of the top one hundred.

Killing one God Realm demonic beast would reap a lot of points, but they were less in number. He needed to spend time looking for them.
