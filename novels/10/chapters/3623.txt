Chapter 3624 – Misunderstanding

After entering the city, Huang Xiaolong started to stroll about.

Even though the Wei Ghost Race caused quite a ruckus among the Jade Whale Race, the city could be said to be bustling. Other than disciples of the Jade Whale Race, there were disciples of various other factions. Huang Xiaolong even managed to discover many experts of the Human Race.

None of the humans who dared to venture into the Sleepless Sea were weak. The weakest among them were Dao Venerables who had comprehended four elements or more to perfection level.

After all, no weaklings would be able to survive the journey there.

Of course, the experts who went to the territory of the Jade Whale Race were people of status in the Human Race. Most of them were experts from the celestial empires. There were even generals of the various celestial empires strolling about as they were sent by the empire to buy special resources that could only be found in the Jade Whale City. They came frequently to buy something called the Jade Whale Sand.

The Jade Whale Sand was one of the most precious resources in the Sleepless Sea. It could be used to refine weapons and build special structures. Everything refined with the Jade Whale Sand would contain a special water attribute. As such, experts of the Human Race were willing to pay vast sums of money for it.

When Huang Xiaolong was casually walking around the city, a commotion broke out in the crowd.

“Murder!!”

“It’s the members of the Wei Ghost Race!”

Screams filled the air.

Soon after, sounds of fighting could be heard.

As the battle progressed, it made its way closer to Huang Xiaolong.

“Hurry up and protect the young lady!” Someone cried.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to see several ladies running towards himself. There were several experts of the Wei Ghost Race following closely behind. Casually looking at them, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the members of the Wei Ghost Race were Dao Venerables who had comprehended all thirteen elements to perfection level.

The ladies arrived before Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye. However, the members of the Wei Ghost Race caught up with them right as they did. The deadly spike in their hands shot towards the ladies.

As Huang Xiaolong was standing right in front of the girls, the members of the Wei Ghost Race didn’t hesitate to drag him into it.

Seeing as the spike was able to impale the ladies from the Jade Whale Race, a sinister smile could be seen on the faces of those from the Wei Ghost Race. However, their arms froze in mid air before the spikes could pierce through anyone’s body.

The ladies stared at the spike that was barely an inch away from their faces with a terrified expression.

Casually tapping the air, Huang Xiaolong sent the members of the Wei Ghost Race flying. When they slammed into the ground, all of them had lost consciousness.

“Seventh Sister!” As the ground rumbled, an army charged towards Huang Xiaolong and the ladies. The person they called out to was the young girl standing before Huang Xiaolong. Her actual name was Bi Xi.

When they heard the cry, the ladies snapped back to reality.

“Third Brother!” Bi Xi cried out in fright.

“Are you alright?!” The leader of the army asked while he came forward.

“We’re fine. We were saved by the young master standing over there.”

Cupping his fists, the leader of the army thanked Huang Xiaolong, “Many thanks for saving my sister. You can call me Bi Luo. How can I address you?”

Everyone standing around cried out in fright when they heard the young man introducing himself.

“That’s Young Master Bi Luo! I’ve heard that he’s the most talented disciple in the fourth generation of the Jade Whale Race! Some say that he’s as talented as His Highness, Ye Jingyu! His achievements in the future will be limitless!”

“I wonder if he entered the God of Creation Realm…”

Everyone standing around broke out into discussion.

“You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master.” Huang Xiaolong casually nodded and laughed, “It’s nothing much. You don’t have to thank me.” After he spoke, he turned to leave.

Bi Luo was stunned.

He was extremely famous and everyone would try to get close to him once they heard who he was. That was the first time a reaction like Huang Xiaolong’s.

Before Huang Xiaolong could leave, an expert standing behind Bi Luo appeared to stop him. “Hold it right there.”

“Bi Haizhou, what do you think you’re doing?!” Bi Xi yelled when she noticed what was going on.

Bi Luo frowned and snapped at the man, “Haozhou, step back right now! You’re not allowed to disrespect him!”

Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, Bi Haizhou roared, “Which family did you come from?! Why did you come to my Jade Whale City?! Speak! Are you working with the members of the Wei Ghost Race?! You’re definitely working together to get close to Bi Xi!”

Bi Luo, Bi Xi, and the others frowned.

Looking at Bi Haizhou, Huang Xiaolong raised a single eyebrow in surprise. “From what I see, you’re the one working with the members of the Wei Ghost Race. You’re probably a spy hidden in the Jade Whale Race.”

“Bullsh*t!” Roaring in anger, Bi Haizhou quickly broke out into laughter, “Brat, how dare you deny the accusation?! You’re definitely trying to sow discord between members of my Jade Whale Race!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the man in amusement. “In fact, you can’t do anything to me even if you determine that I’m working with them.

Bi Haizhou sneered, “Are you finally admitting it?! Bi Luo, you heard him. He admits that he’s a spy from the Wei Ghost Race.”

With his expression sinking, Bi Luo growled, “Enough! Get back right now!”

He revealed an apologetic expression and spoke to Huang Xiaolong, “Haizhou acted out of line. If he offended you, I apologize on his behalf.”

“I’ll kill a million of him with a single slap. Why would I be offended by an ant?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Bi Luo and the others were shocked.

“You’re asking to die!” Bi Haizhou scrambled in rage and the spear in his hand shot at Huang Xiaolong. “I’ll kill you, you f*cking spy!”

Huang Xiaolong ignored the spear completely and he slapped Bi Haizhou across the face. Like a shooting star, Bi Haizhou was sent smashing into one of the walls nearby.

Bi Luo widened his eyes in fright.

When they turned to look at Bi Haizhou, they saw that he was a sorry mess. He might still be alive, but he wasn’t close to death. Even though Bi Haizhou wasn’t as strong as Bi Luo, their strength didn’t differ by much. They were both close to the God of Creation Realm.

“I’ll spare your life this time. If you try that again, I’ll kill you.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

When Huang Xiaolong threw the accusation that Bi Haizhou was a spy for the Wei Ghost Race, he was mucking about. However, he managed to hit the nail on the head, Bi Haizhou really was a spy for the Wei Ghost Race. He wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong as he was afraid that the truth would get out.

It seemed as though the Jade Whale Race was a mess. There were traitors in the race no matter how Huang Xiaolong looked at it. Moreover, Bi Haizhou was definitely supported by someone high up in the race. Otherwise, a fourth generation disciple like BI Haizhou who hadn’t entered the God of Creation Realm wouldn’t dare to conspire with members of another race.

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to bother with the Jade Whale Race.

Getting ready to take his leave, someone else screamed, “Take him down right now! He crippled Captain Haizhou!”

Hearing the scream, disciples of the Jade Whale Race rushed over to surround Huang Xiaolong.

“Who dares to hurt my son?!” Someone screamed and rushed towards the group.

The person who arrived was Bi Haizhou’s father, Bi Shifei. He was a grand elder in the Jade Whale Race and he was a God of Creation with 3.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

Huang Xiaolong clasped his hands behind his back and looked at the newcomer.

Rushing forward, Bi Luo hastily explained, “Grand Elder, this is a misunderstanding!”

Bi Shifei looked at Bi Haizhou who was stuck in the wall and killing intent filled his heart. He turned to look at Huang Xiaolong before storming over.
