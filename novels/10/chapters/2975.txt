Chapter 2976: Ming Fu’s Conjecture

A late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert’s strength was only second to a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable! Yet, when facing Huang Xiaolong, even such an expert was sealed in ice in an instant without a chance to counter at all!

The late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert was a famous old monster, and his notorious reputation was as loud as the Heart Devourer Twin Devils, and he was called Old Man Di Ming. He had not appeared for many years, yet he ended up being sealed, captured, and thrown into the dragonpearl by Huang Xiaolong in their first confrontation. Everything happened so fast and smoothly that the incident did not alarm Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, Black Shadow Devil, or others at the Blue Lotus Pond.

After dealing with Old Man Di Ming, Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared in a blur. In the next moment, he reappeared in front of another late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert.

In similar swift actions, Huang Xiaolong sealed the expert with the perfection absolute frost power, and then he restrained the expert’s dao soul and small world before throwing him into the dragon pearl.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t in a hurry to get to Poison Bodach and Sword Venerable’s group, but he chose to deal with these lone Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts, and deal with these loners first and leave the Poison Bodach’s group for last.

Currently, there were over six hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables gathered at the Blue Lotus Pond!

Almost all of the Divine Tuo Holy World’s Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables were here, even Huang Xiaolong who had achieved perfection with his absolute frost power wouldn’t gain an advantage being besieged by this many Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables.

One, two, three… more and more Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables were sealed and thrown into the dragon pearl by Huang Xiaolong. In a short one hour, Huang Xiaolong had dealt with more than a hundred of them!

The weakest ones amongst these experts were early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables, and the strongest ones were late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables. Some acted alone, and a few moved in small groups of ten or so. However, all of them were sealed by Huang Xiaolong’s perfection absolute frost power in the first instance, and there wasn’t a chance to resist or escape at all.

It was a stroke of luck that Huang Xiaolong’s absolute frost power had entered perfection state, enabling him to seal his opponents in a split second, or else, as long as one person retaliated, the energy fluctuations would surely alert Poison Bodach and other peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables.

Still, Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the others discovered something was amiss when Huang Xiaolong captured more than two hundred experts.

“Yin Ming’s thirteen disciples are missing!”

“Strange, Cang Jingren has lost contact too!”

“Sha Zhiyao is also missing!”

News of missing people came consecutively.

Everyone reacted before long.

“They wouldn’t be caught in some restricted space, right?”

“Impossible! Even if they are trapped inside a restricted space, they can still be contacted!”

Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the Nine-headed Tree Demon’s group also heard about these missing people.

“How can these people go missing inexplicably?” The Nine-headed Tree Demon felt something fishy was going on, “Someone ambushed these people?”

The Stonemen Race Patriarch Shi Dan's brows furrowed. "But we didn't feel any energy fluctuations from battles!"

If there were energy fluctuations from battles, with them within the Blue Lotus Pond, it was impossible for them not to sense anything.

Poison Bodach's eyes gleamed, "No energy fluctuations. Maybe they were subdued before they had a chance to fight!”

“What?!” Everyone was stunned by Poison Bodach’s words.

But Sword Venerable shook his head in the next second. “Not possible! Yin Ming’s thirteen disciples are all mid-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables or stronger! Moreover, Ying Ming’s eldest disciple has entered late-Ninth Dao Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. Moreover, the thirteen of them never leave each other’s side. Who in the world could subdue the thirteen of them in an instant? Even if Old Monster Flame and Black Shadow Devil join hands, it’s still impossible!”

“That’s right, unless there were thirteen peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables attacking them at the same time, that’s the only way to subdue Yin Ming’s thirteen disciples at the same time!” The Inferno Race Patriarch Yan Tianyang pointed out, “But now, only our alliance has thirteen peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts.”

Poison Bodach did not retort as he really couldn’t think of any other method that could subdue Yin Ming's thirteen disciples in one fell swoop silently.

Then, a thought occurred to him, and his expression stiffened. Could it be? But he snubbed the thought in the next second. Impossible!

Although Poison Bodach couldn’t figure it out, he insisted solemnly, “From now on, everyone must not separate, and pay attention to the surroundings!”

The Poison Valley, Supreme Sword Palace, and World Tree’s experts complied.

“Also, pass my word that if someone joins our alliance, we’re more than welcome.” Poison Bodach added.

Sword Venerable’s eyes lit up, and he grinned. “Brother Poison Bodach is wise!”

Although many experts had joined their alliance, there were still those arrogant characters that refused their invitation. With Yin Ming’s thirteen disciples, Cang Jingren, Sha Zhiyao, and many other experts disappearing for no reason, it would cause some panic. Panic would drive people to seek safety in numbers, thus they would come to join their alliance on their own.

As expected, there were consecutive groups who came to join the Poison Valley, Supreme Sword Palace, and World Tree’s alliance.

…..

Several days later.

Somewhere in the Blue Lotus Pond, Huang Xiaolong’s three dao souls covered the entire Blue Lotus Pond.

Ever since the news of Ying Ming’s thirteen disciples, Cang Jingren, Sha Zhiyao, and others’ disappearance had spread, many experts began to form groups, and those that did not form groups all joined the three forces’ alliance. Even those peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables did not wander alone, instead chose to move around in groups of three or four people.

This increased the difficulty for Huang Xiaolong to subdue more experts.

Under his three dao souls’ survey, Huang Xiaolong finally set his sights on a group on the north side. There were forty-plus experts in this group, but there wasn’t any peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, and this made dealing with them a bit easier.

This group on the north side was led by a young man wearing an orange Buddhist robe, with Buddha luminance around him as if he had the blessings and protection of a myriad of Buddhas. This young man was an expert ordained as Ming Fu, and although he was only a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert, his amazing battle prowess put him at the same level as a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert.

Rumor had it, that Ming Fu had evolved from a genesis Luminance Buddhist stone, and hence he possessed an innate Luminance Buddha Physique. He had never lost in a fight, and his strength was second to existences like Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the Nine-headed Tree Demon. It was said Ming Fu had a hundred million Buddhist kingdoms under him and over a trillion Buddhist disciples and Buddhist believers.

“Lord Ming Fu, do you think Yin Ming’s thirteen disciples, Cang Jingren, and the others missing, are related to Old Monster Flame or Black Shadow Devil? one of the mid-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts asked the young man.

Ming Fu had a third eye on his forehead enshrouded in a soft golden halo. “Not likely! Neither Old Monster Flame, nor Black Shadow Devil have any reason to act against Yin Ming’s thirteen disciples, Cang Jingren, and any of the missing people.”

“Then, what do you think, Lord Ming Fu?” a genesis race’s expert couldn’t help asking. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yin Ming’s thirteen disciples, Cang Jingren, and all those missing people… Who is their common enemy?” Ming Fu suddenly asked in return.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Someone’s face ashend, “Lord Ming Fu, do you mean the Son of Creation?!”

Yin Ming’s thirteen disciples, Cang Jingren, and all those missing people’s common enemy could only be one person, and that was Huang Xiaolong!

Because everyone had entered the Blue Lotus Pond for one reason only, and it was to find Huang Xiaolong and snatch the Tree of Beginning, and the Fruit of Beginning!

Of course, there was also the Huang Long Armor!

Ming Fu nodded with a serious expression. “That’s right, I have a gut feeling that those people’s disappearance is related to Huang Xiaolong.”
