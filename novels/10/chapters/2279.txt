Chapter 2280: Half-True Saint!

Jiang Wuji, the Revered River Divine’s Sect Chief, patriarchs, and others stepped forward accordingly and saluted Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong had already guessed the identities of Tan Hongyi’s group. Thus he didn’t show much surprise after hearing that they were attending Jiang Wuji’s birthday banquet.

But when it was the Chen Family’s Patriarch Chen Kebin’s turn to salute Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong chuckled lightly as he asked, “You’re the Chen Family’s Patriarch? I attacked the Chen Family’s main residence not long ago, injuring your Chen Family’s two Eminent Elders and several thousand experts. Patriarch Chen, you won’t resent me in your heart for this, right?”

Chen Kebin was momentarily stunned being ‘ambushed’ by Huang Xiaolong out of nowhere, but he managed to squeeze a smile and said, “No, no, I dare not, Your Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong. Your Highness must have had a good reason for doing that. How dare I, Chen Kebin, harbor any resentment towards Your Highness?!”

When the introductions were done, Jiang Tian and the rest cordially ‘invited’ Huang Xiaolong into the Jiang Family headquarters’ main hall.

After walking into the main hall, Huang Xiaolong saw that there were merely two seats placed at the center. He sneered inwardly as he took one step ahead, and sat on one of the two seats faster than anyone.

Everyone was stupefied by his action. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Even Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji were left dazed on the spot.

Gradually, the stupefied expressions on the patriarchs and sect chiefs’ faces turned into strange expressions.

“Huang Xiaolong, the center seats are intended for Jiang Tian and Jiang Family’s forefather. Who do you think you are to grab one of the center seats? Even our seats are further down.”

The Evolving Dragon Holy Ground’s Holy Prince Qu Jiangmeng couldn’t hold in his temper and snapped at Huang Xiaolong, “Quickly get off and roll down!”

A few of the Holy Princes of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground, who had come to attend the banquet from millions of miles away, could only sit below the center seats. On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong, a new Holy Prince, who had entered the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground recently, had the guts to grab the center seat?!

Qu Jiangmeng was not the only person infuriated by this, but Tan Hongyi and the rest of Evolving Dragon Holy Ground’s Holy Princes were just as ticked off.

This Huang Xiaolong thinks everyone is beneath him!

Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant gaze fell on Qu Jiangmeng as he gave a tepid response, “Just because you are only qualified to sit further down doesn’t mean others are not qualified to sit at the center.”

His current identity and status were already above Jiang Tian. Li Wen merely had not made a public announcement.

But to Tan Hongyi’s group, Huang Xiaolong’s words were full of ridicule and mockery.

Qu Jiangmeng laughed in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think others won’t dare to harm you because you are Zhuoyuan Holy Ground’s Holy Prince? Since you refuse to roll down, I’ll just have to make you!” Even as he spoke, he made a grabbing motion at Huang Xiaolong, intending to throw him out of the hall while shouting, “Roll down here for me!”

This Qu Jiangmeng was a peak mid-Tenth Order Sovereign Realm expert. With his strength, even many peak late-Tenth Order Sovereign Realm experts would have trouble resisting the force from his palm.

While many had already imagined the scene where Huang Xiaolong would be ‘helplessly’ thrown out of the hall by Qu Jiangmeng, Chen Kebin was especially anticipating Huang Xiaolong’s shameful end with a gloating heart. But one of the guardians behind Huang Xiaolong casually flicked his sleeve.

A powerful force that horrified Qu Jiangmeng swept out like a tsunami, tearing space.

Qu Jiangmei staggered backward until his body hit the main hall’s door, and he plopped to the floor on his butt.

Everyone was dumbfounded by this result.

“Half-True Saint!”

Several patriarchs exclaimed.

There were quite a number of Venerable Realm experts in the holy ground, but late-Tenth Order Venerables and peak late-Tenth Order Venerables were few in numbers. For example most of the Holy Gate’s several continent branch masters cultivations were between late-Tenth Order and peak late-Tenth Order Venerable Realm.

Only a half-True Saint was considered as a real powerhouse expert in the holy ground!

A half-True Saint was enough to make all the top Venerable sects, the most elite of families, even the Central Holy Dynasty’s imperial family walk on eggshells.

In the absence of a True Saint, a half-True Saint was a king.

It had never crossed anyone’s mind that one of Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates could be a half-True Saint!

Even Jiang Tian was taken aback by this finding.

No need to ask that this half-True Saint was definitely arranged by the Eminent Elders to protect Huang Xiaolong.

While in shock, Jiang Tian’s thoughts became active. He knew there were several half-True Saints within the Holy Gate, but he had never seen this person before....

Suddenly, his face turned gloomy. Is he...? The thought that appeared in his mind made his heart sink.

He hadn’t expected that Li Wen and the rest of the Eminent Elders would have agreed to let the Holy Gate’s guardians protect Huang Xiaolong by his side!

Has Huang Xiaolong’s importance reached this height in the Eminent Elders’ minds?

But, the more things were like this, the more it fueled Jiang Tian’s desire to kill Huang Xiaolong.

“Junior Brother Qu, are you alright?”

On the other hand, despite their shock, Tan Hongyi and his companions quickly arrived by Qu Jiangmeng’s side and helped him up, and checked his injuries at the same time.

Seeing that Qu Jiangmeng was fine, Tan Hongyi and his companions regained their composure.

Then, Tan Hongyi’s icy gaze was locked onto the four guardians behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong, your subordinates injured my Evolving Dragon Holy Ground’s Holy Prince. Do you know what the consequences are?” Tan Hongyi demanded in an overbearing tone.

Yet Huang Xiaolong remained unperturbed, “Erm, I really don’t know the so-called consequences. Why doesn’t Holy Prince Tan Hongyi explain it to me?”

“You—!”

Tan Hongyi was enraged, and released an overwhelming pressure from his body that enveloped the entire Central Holy Dynasty’s thousands and thousands of li wide capital city.

The present patriarchs and sect chiefs were astounded that Tan Hongyi was actually a half-True Saint himself!

But, Jiang Tian caught the right time and spoke to Tan Hongyi through voice transmission. After listening to Jiang Tian’s words, a smile flitted across Tan Hongyi’s eyes. He glared at the four guardians behind Huang Xiaolong and turned to Huang Xiaolong and taunted, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re merely relying on the strengths of your subordinates to be arrogant. That’s not your ability. If you’re a man, come fight me yourself!”

Fight you? Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly. His gaze swept over Jiang Tian, Tan Hongyi, and the others. Before entering the main hall, he had smelled something brewing. It seems this was what Jiang Tian and these people were plotting for.

Huang Xiaolong remained calm but there was a thick taste of ridicule in his words, “Fight you personally? I, a Sovereign Realm cultivator fight you, a half-True Saint? Tan Hongyi, why don’t a half-True Saint like you go challenge a True Saint?”

Despite Tan Hongyi’s thick face, his face was slightly red from Huang Xiaolong’s ridicule.

Indeed, if word were to get out that a half-True Saint was actually challenging a Sovereign Realm cultivator to a battle, it would only make people laugh till their bellies ached.

The Evolving Dragon Holy Ground’s Holy Prince Yang Rong interjected, “Huang Xiaolong, how noble is my Senior Brother Tan? Don’t assume you’re qualified to fight against him. I will suppress my cultivation to the same as yours, and challenge you to a battle. Will you dare to accept my challenge?”

“That’s right, Huang Xiaolong. You once fought Holy Prince Huang Zhouping in the arena, and today, in the same way, we challenge you to a battle on the Central Holy Dynasty’s battle stage!” Another Evolving Dragon Holy Ground’s Holy Prince Zhang Bing stated coldly, “Don’t tell me you’re afraid of death, and you are chickening out now?”

“If you are afraid of death, and do not dare to accept the challenge, then I think you should roll back to the Holy Gate headquarters and hide there like a turtle. You shouldn’t come out and make a fool of yourself.”

Huang Xiaolong sat comfortably with a lazy smile as he watched Yang Rong and Zhang Bing ‘sing’ one after another, “Battle on the Central Holy Dynasty’s battle stage?”

Huang Xiaolong had part of Wan Zhuoyuan’s memories, as well as the memories of two Hall Masters’ disciples from the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground. Thus he knew that Yang Rong’s complete dao saint godhead was the Dragon Swallowing Saint Godhead ranked at 2,780’s, and his saint bloodline and saint physique had slightly lower rankings, in the 2,800 range.

Yang Rong’s talent among the Holy Prince was indeed better than Huang Xiaolong’s ‘surface’ potential.
