Chapter 2978: Who’s Fighting With Ming Fu?

These people were outraged when they heard Huang Xiaolong say that he would allow them to leave if they took one blow from him. But now, it was apprehensive silence. No one dared to utter a word.

Peak major completion absolute poison power!

No one could take that kind of hit from Huang Xiaolong and come unscathed at the other end.

And everyone discovered that Huang Xiaolong had entered the Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

Ming Fu was just as shocked as everyone else upon finding that Huang Xiaolong had advanced to early Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. At the time of the Creation Ceremony, Huang Xiaolong was still only a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable, this was no secret in the entire Divine Tuo Holy World. But they had learned not long ago when Huang Xiaolong had defeated the Heart Devourer Twin Devils that he had already entered peak early Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

And now, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had risen to early Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

This was literally a magic show, can Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation rise whenever he wants it? He really couldn’t figure out how in the world Huang Xiaolong cultivated and how Huang Xiaolong advanced…

Are these the benefits of the Tree of Beginning and Fruit of Beginning?! If it’s real, then this is too mind-blowingly heaven-defying. Ming Fu was severely tempted as he thought about this.

“Huang Xiaolong, did you say that anyone who takes one hit from you can leave?” Ming Fu asked in all seriousness.

“Correct,” Huang Xiaolong responded placidly.

Ming Fu went on seriously, “I want to add one condition. If I succeed, I want ten Fruits of Beginning!” In his opinion, asking for ten Fruits of Beginning was not too much.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Did I hear right? After taking one move from me, not only do I have to let you go, but also give you ten Fruits of Beginning?”

Even Ming Fu couldn’t help blushing when Huang Xiaolong put it like that.

……

Somewhere in the Blue Lotus Pond, Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, the Nine-headed Tree Demon suddenly stopped moving, and looked in one direction with astonishment. When Huang Xiaolong sent the peak mid-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert flying with one punch, despite his excellent control, it was enough for Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the Nine-headed Tree Demon were top experts to capture the energy fluctuations no matter how negligible they were.

“This energy… It’s peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables fighting?!” The Nine-headed Tree Demon exclaimed in shock.

“This person’s strength might very well be above us!” Sword Venerable pointed out with a solemn expression.

But Poison Bodach looked greatly astonished, “This is the peak major completion absolute poison power?!” His absolute poison power had reached major completion. Hence,he was very sensitive towards the power of absolute poison, and that person’s power of absolute poison was above his!

“What? Peak major completion of absolute poison power?” Others were shocked when they heard Poison Bodach’s words.

The power of absolute poison was fundamentally a terror, and Poison Bodach was able to deter many other peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables mainly because of his major completion absolute poison power, but now, there was someone who wielded peak major completion absolute poison power that was more horrifying than Poison Bodach’s major completion absolute poison power?!

“That can’t possibly be true, right?” The Stonemen Race Patriarch Shi Dan exclaimed in astonishment, “I’ve never heard of anyone reaching peak major completion with his absolute poison power, and even that toad’s absolute poison power is at the same level as Brother Poison Bodach.”

The toad he mentioned was the ancestor of poisons, a genesis era existence like them.

In truth, Poison Bodach himself was surprised as he too couldn’t think of anyone else in the Divine Tuo Holy World who could wield the power of absolute poison.

Right at this time, luminance Buddhist energy soared up, and then an icy blue light lit up the sky, followed by a resounding explosion in the next second.

Overwhelming aftershock waves swept out.

The entire Blue Lotus Pond swayed violently for a moment as if its barrier was about to crumble, and it was not only the Blue Lotus Pond, but also the several neighboring sacred lands. Enormous fissures opened through some sacred lands.

“What a powerful luminance Buddhist energy!”

“That is the absolute frost power?! Perfection absolute frost power?!” Even Sword Venerable, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, and the others couldn’t conceal the shock on their faces.

“It’s Ming Fu!” someone blurted out.

As far as they knew, only the King of All-Buddhas, the Ancestors of Buddhas, the highest Buddha Ming Fu possessed this degree of luminance Buddhist energy in the world, and despite the overlapping spaces and distance between them, they strangely felt a cleansing power over them.

“Who’s fighting with Ming Fu? The Ice Goddess?” some experts made a guess.

The Ice Goddess had also comprehended the power of absolute frost and had long reached perfection.

Poison Bodach shook his head, “It’s not the Ice Goddess. Although the Ice Goddess’ absolute frost power has reached perfection, her cultivation realm is still at late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. Therefore, she could fight Ming Fu to a draw at most with her current strength, but that perfection absolute frost power just now clearly overpowered Ming Fu. That person is stronger than Ming Fu!”

Others might not see that Ming Fu’s luminance Buddhist energy was suppressed by the other person completely, but Poison Bodach could clearly see it.

“Let’s go over and take a look!” Sword Venerable turned into a streak of sword light and disappeared.

Poison Bodach, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, and a large group of people also flew towards Ming Fu’s direction.

While they flew towards where Ming Fu was, Old Monster Flame, Black Shadow Devil, and other peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables were also headed towards the same destination.

When Poison Bodach and the others arrived, the experts who were in the same group with Ming Fu were astounded by what they had witnessed. Ming Fu had shot out like a meteor after one punch from Huang Xiaolong, and by the time Ming Fu had smashed into the waters, he had turned into a frozen ice statue. Not only that, but even the spot where Ming Fu fell into the waters was not frozen into ice.

One punch!

Ming Fu was sealed and defeated!

“Peak major completion l-level absolute fr-frost power?!” one of the mid-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts stuttered.

“No, it’s perfection absolute frost power!” a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert corrected. Within this group, other than Ming Fu, this person was the strongest, and he was also a genesis era old monster. The difference was that Ming Fu was born with an innate Luminance Buddha Physique, whereas, he was merely a sea monster-a tortoise!

He was known for his unbreakable defense, hailed as the Ancestor of Tortoises.

“Perfection level absolute frost power!”

Hearing that, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air as they stared at Huang Xiaolong in astonishment—perfection absolute frost power!

Even the Divine Tuo Holy World’s current top ten experts did not necessarily wield perfection absolute power. Like Poison Bodach and Black Shadow Devil! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

While everyone was in shock, Huang Xiaolong disappeared from their view in a flicker.

“Retreat!” The Tortoise Ancestor suddenly shouted as a vigorous green light burst out from his body, and a huge tortoise shell rose from his back. The shell protected his whole body, and the many profound runes on the tortoise shell’s surface formed layers of protective boundaries in an instant.

But in the same instant, these protective boundaries were tightly enshrouded by icy blue lights one after another, and not a gap could be seen.

Huang Xiaolong looked placidly at the Tortoise Ancestor and others who had been sealed frozen. The Tortoise Ancestor was indeed strong, and if he had not mastered absolute frost power, he really couldn’t have sealed all these people. Unfortunately for these people, the power of absolute frost perfection was not something a tortoise shell could block!

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong sent Ming Fu, the Tortoise Ancestor, and the rest into the dragon pearl.

“Huang Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong had just thrown Ming Fu and the others into the dragon pearl when he heard a thunderous voice call out, and in the next second, a sharp sword light descended before him. Sword Venerable stood in front of him, followed by Poison Bodach, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, and the rest as they arrived consecutively.
