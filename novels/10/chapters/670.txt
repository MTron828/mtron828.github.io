Colorful Balloons Take Flight

On this day, Huang Xiaolong was practicing his alchemy skills as usual in the Palace of Nine Halls. His hands waved and numerous elixirs flew into the air like they had a mind of their own as they flew around, grouping together and shaping into several ancient divine beasts! These divine beasts numbered exactly one hundred!

Any Alchemist Grandmaster seeing this scene would be absolutely rendered speechless with shock.

Compared to the Dragon Clan’s hand techniques that Huang Xiaolong used when he first met the Ascending Moon Old Man, the Transfiguring Hand of the Dragon and Nine Dragons Rising to the Heavens, this technique was much more difficult to master!

Manipulating all the ingredients into taking the form of various ancient divine beasts requires delicate and masterful control, and an extremely terrifying understanding of elixirs to reach this stage.

Because dissonance existed between certain elixirs, forget about grouping them into the shape of an ancient divine beast, they could hardly shape a simple diagram.

After these elixirs assembled in the form of one hundred ancient divine beasts, they flew in the air, uniting into one large diagram formation.

This diagram formation resembled an ancient symbol, yet it also looked like a mysterious living being from an era long past.

When the diagram formation was completed, spheres of light floated out from its surface. At first, these spheres of light were weak, but very quickly they became bright and dazzling.

All this time, Huang Xiaolong’s hands did not stop moving, controlling the diagram formation formed by those hundred ancient divine beasts. Then, his opened mouth wide and a large ball of true immortal essence fire flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s mouth, falling right at the center of the ancient divine beast diagram formation.

Starting from the diagram formation’s center, more than ten ancient divine beasts begin to light up, gradually spreading outward to the other ancient divine beasts.

In a matter of seconds, all one hundred ancient divine beasts were set aflame.

Purified by the true immortal essence fire, all the elixirs turned into pure essence liquid. Surprisingly, after these elixirs were purified into essence liquid, they did not fall from the air, nor did they separate. Instead, they continued hovering in the air.

Very soon, all one hundred divine beasts were turned into pure essence liquid.

Huang Xiaolong’s hands formed one seal after another, causing the pure essence liquid hovering in the air to move, merging. This process was extremely beautiful, just like divine beasts flying in the sky, like a hundred dragons playing in the water and a hundred phoenixes flapping their wings.

As these different pure essence liquids continue to integrate, they emitted a soft light from their depths. At the end of the integration, the soft light grew bright and dazzling.

Roars of various ancient divine beasts could be heard from the dazzling light; dragon roars, cries of phoenixes, growls of tigers and bears, calls of eagles, and apes screaming.

These noises weren’t chaotic and messy, but followed a particular rhythm. It was like the most natural music of nature, beautifully harmonious, giving the listener a serene feeling. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When the lilting music stopped, the dazzling light disappeared as well. Round spiritual pellets immediately fell downward.

Under the sunlight, these spiritual pellets exuded a jade-like radiance, shining like gold and emitting hues akin to colorful pearls.

An enthralling fragrance filled the hall, a fragrance that seemed to penetrate to the deepest void, penetrating a person’s soul.

Not one more, not one less, exactly a hundred pellets!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up looking at these spiritual pellets.

Finally, he succeeded in refining these legendary Hundred Divine Beasts Pellets without using a furnace! Moreover, each and every pellet was top grade!

This Hundred Divine Beasts Pellet was the most difficult to refine amongst all other sacred grade divine pellets, and it was of a much higher grade than the Three Revolutions Golden Pills that Huang Xiaolong consumed.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to put the Hundred Divine Beasts Pellets into a bottle, a giant ethereal hand emerged from the void, snatching all the Hundred Divine Beasts Pellets in one swipe.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked, then a loud hearty laughter reverberated in the hall, “What an excellent All Creation Fortune Hand Technique, an excellent Pill Refining Divine Beast Diagram!”

Hearing this laughter, Huang Xiaolong relaxed instead. A smile appeared on his face, “Old man, you’re finally willing to return.”

Bright light rippled in the space above as a withered-looking old man appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong. This person was none other than the Ascending Moon Old Man.

The Ascending Moon Old Man still looked similar to the time he left, forever in that worn old robe of his.

The Ascending Moon Old Man scolded in jest, “You smelly brat, what old man, call me Big Master, understand? Forget it, for the sake of this batch of Hundred Divine Beast Pellets, this old man will not argue with you.” Finished saying that, without waiting for Huang Xiaolong to react, he kept all the Hundred Divine Beasts Pellets into his spatial ring.

Huang Xiaolong’s mouth was opened but the words wouldn’t come. This old man’s skin was still as thick; he had spent great effort and energy in order to refine these Hundred Divine Beasts Pellets, furthermore, when did he agree to give them to the old man?

“Say, old man, as the Master, you disappeared for more than twenty years. The moment you come back, you just reach out your hand taking away your disciple’s divine pellets, do you feel no shame?” Huang Xiaolong was unwilling to lose his Hundred Divine Beasts Pills just like that!

The Ascending Moon Old Man grinned slyly, “As the disciple, when you have good stuff, you should honor your Master. Do you feel no shame bringing this up.”

‘Fine...’ Huang Xiaolong shut his mouth, knowing full well that he would never see the Hundred Divine Beasts Pellets again.

Watching him, the Ascending Moon Old Man said, “Of course, as your Master, I wouldn’t take your Hundred Divine Beasts Pills for nothing. Here, these are the treasures that Master is giving you!” The Ascending Moon Old Man took out a pearl from his spatial ring!

It was a glossy, about half a fist-sized white pearl. However, this white pearl was emitting a strong Buddhism energy.

“This is...?!” Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

“This is a Buddha śarīra.” The Ascending Moon Old Man’s expression turned serious as he said this.

“Buddha śarīra!" [1] Both Huang Xiaolong and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi exclaimed in unison.]

The Ascending Moon Old Man continued, “This Buddha śarīra is something Master fought using his life to get.” As he said this, the Ascending Moon Old Man coughed lightly, obviously due to injuries.

The Ascending Moon Old Man was actually injured!

Both Huang Xiaolong and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi were shocked by this fact. With the Ascending Moon Old Man’s strength, there were actually people who could injure him?

“Old man, are you alright?” Huang Xiaolong asked in a strained voice.

The Ascending Moon Old Man waved his hand, “Nothing serious. If it was one on one, those punks wouldn’t be your Master’s opponents, but those punks actually joined up, five against one. Those sissy fudges, your Master hasn’t been injured in over sixty thousand years, it was so thrilling!”

Huang Xiaolong was speechless. Was this old man a masochist as well?

But looking from his appearance, the Ascending Moon Old Man didn’t seem to be heavily injured, otherwise, he wouldn’t be jesting that it was thrilling.

Huang Xiaolong carefully picked up the Buddha śarīra from the Ascending Moon Old Man’s hand. Once it was in Huang Xiaolong’s palm, the Buddha śarīra issued a faint gentle glow, shrouding Huang Xiaolong within.

The Buddha śarīra gave Huang Xiaolong an intimate feeling.

“It seems like this Buddha śarīra does not reject you.” Watching the Buddha śarīras’ reaction, the Ascending Moon Old Man was pleased, “That’s a relief.”
