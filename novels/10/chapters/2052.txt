Chapter 2053: Dun Ei’s Death!

All-Heavens Envoy Yang Gang barely finished his words when the Radiance Divine Scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand was stabbing towards Yang Gang’s eyes.

Yang Gang was taken aback but still had the mind to block Huang Xiaolong’s attack with the All-Heavens Decree in his hand.

Clang! The piercing noise of metals clashing cut across the air.

Yang Gang’s entire arm felt numb from the impact, and his back was damp with cold sweat.

At the same time, Yang Gang was shocked to his soul. The strength of Huang Xiaolong’s strike was so powerful that his entire arm went numb. No wonder even Chiyou failed to withstand Huang Xiaolong’s attack.

In this split second, Qin Fan, Chu Han, Lu Kun, and Chiyou’s attacks reached Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong could only give up attacking Yang Gang. He turned around to parry the four people’s attacks.

Out of nowhere, a world-shaking eruption thundered, nearly breaking everyone’s eardrums.

Everyone turned to look at the source in trepidation. They saw the Buddha World’s experts had once again got the Godly Mt Xumi into the air under Shi Zhen’s command and collided with the Ancient Heavenly Court.

The Ancient Heavenly Court was thrown far away by the impact.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold harrumph sounded in the air as his figure disappeared in a flicker. In the next second, he was back inside the Complete Heaven Palace.

“Dean Reverence Moon, Master, Senior Mutian, please come in and assist me in driving the Ancient Heavenly Court!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“Alright!” Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist, and Cang Mutian agreed sonorously. Huang Xiaolong subsequently opened a ‘door’ through the Ancient Heavenly Star Formation, allowing Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, the little cow, King of Darkness, Du Hai, and the rest to enter.

With the addition of the six big shots’ power into the Complete Heaven Palace, the Ancient Heavenly Court’s starlight boundary expanded ten thousand zhang, and there was enough light to light up numerous world surfaces. Simultaneously, all the experts of Radiance Divine City felt a terrifying pressure pressing down on them.

Destructive power, enough to blast a world surface, was condensing from the Ancient Heavenly Court.

Old Monster Lun Zhuan, the King of Shadows, Old Crow Ancestor, Shi Ming, and others’ expressions clouded at this sight. They actually sensed mortal danger from the power accumulating within the Ancient Heavenly Court!

With the Reverence Moon Old Man and the others inside, the Ancient Heavenly Court was the most powerful fort and weapon all in one.

“Buddhist Ancestor Shi Zhen, quickly let us into the Godly Mt. Xumi!” The Old Crow Ancestor shouted towards Shi Zhen, who was inside the Godly Mt. Xumi.

“Only with all of our power the Godly Mt. Xumi can stand against the Ancient Heavenly Court, hurry up!” Old Monster Lun Zhuan urged anxiously, “Otherwise, all of us will die here!”

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming, King of Shadows, and others also rushed Shi Zhen anxiously.

Inside the Godly Mt. Xumi, the furrows between Shi Zhen’s brows deepened with each passing second.

Shi Zhen, of course, knew the facts Lun Zhuan spoke. However, if he let Old Crow Ancestor, Shi Ming, King of Shadows, Old Monster Lun Zhuan, and others into the Godly Mt. Xumi, what if they gave birth to other ideas? What if, after coming into the Godly Mt. Xumi, Old Crow Ancestor and the others joined hands to wrestle the Godly Mt. Xumi from him? That was no different than inviting wolves into one’s abode.

Even though in this battle, he was on the same side as Old Crow Ancestor, King of Shadows, Old Monster Lun Zhuan, Shi Ming, and the others, there was no close relationship between them. It was needless to say that each person had their own scheming and calculation.

A buzzing noise reverberated.

Waves of starlight burst from the Ancient Heavenly Court like a string of blazing stars strung together, and it shot towards the Godly Mt. Xumi at a terrifying speed.

Whether it was Old Monster Lun Zhuan, Old Crow Ancestor, or Shi Ming, as well as the King of Shadows, even the Treasure World and Poison World’s experts, all of them were horrified.

“Enter!”

In the last crucial moments, Shi Zhen shouted as he opened an entrance through the Godly Mt. Xumi’s grand formation for Old Monster Lun Zhuan, Old Crow Ancestor, Shi Ming, King of Shadows, and the rest to enter.

Hearing that, Old Monster Lun Zhuan and the others hurried into the Godly Mt. Xumi and sent their godforce into the Godly Mt. Xumi’s grand formation without a second thought.

With the supplement of their combined godforce, the Godly Mt. Xumi emitted a vigorous and boundless Buddha halo. Figures of golden Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Arhats appeared above and around the Godly Mt. Xumi. There was also the surreal manifestation of an old man. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This old man’s manifestation did not possess any awe-inspiring aura, but standing in the air, all the surrounding golden Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Arhats prostrated before him.

“Xumi Old Man!” Reverence Moon Old Man, the King of Grandmist, little cow, and the others exclaimed, as their eyes narrowed solemnly, looking at the old man’s phantom figure.

The awakened old man’s phantom was a soul imprint the Xumi Old Man placed on the Godly Mt. Xumi.

This was not some remnant soul. It was Xumi Old Man’s complete soul man that contained a part of Xumi Old Man’s power.

Watching the Ancient Heavenly Court speeding towards the Godly Mt. Xumi, Xumi Old Man raised his hand and slapped his palm onto the Ancient Heavenly Court. Before the amazed gazes from all-around, a massive palm appeared in midair, slapping down on the Ancient Heavenly Court.

The Ancient Heavenly Court had reached its biggest size with the Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist, and the others’ godforce. It was as big as a super world surface. However, the golden Buddha palm was bigger than the Ancient Heavenly Court.

Bang! The golden Buddha’s palm struck the Ancient Heavenly Court with precision.

The Ancient Heavenly Star Formation burst out in glaring light as the entire Ancient Heavenly Court shook and swayed from the impact.

But the Ancient Heavenly Court still forged ahead with an unyielding momentum, piercing through the golden Buddha palm and rammed straight into the Godly Mt. Xumi.

Even though Xumi Old Man was powerful, it was merely a soul imprint. How could he completely block the Ancient Heavenly Court driven by the Reverence Moon Old Man and several other big shots?

BOOM⸺! It was as if the heavens exploded.

Space crevices appeared, torn by the collision aftershock waves. The Godly Mt. Xumi’s golden halo was devastated in an instant. The numerous golden Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Arhats vanished. Even Xumi Old Man’s phantom soul imprint turned almost invisible as it shrunk back into the Godly Mt. Xumi.

The entire Godly Mt. Xumi was knocked flying backward like a spinning golden-colored ball, crashing into one of the world surfaces in the distance. The world surface shattered into pieces.

Inside the Godly Mt. Xumi, some of the weaker low-level and mid-level Emperor Realm Bodhisattvas and Arhats exploded to their deaths. At the same time, the flesh of high-level Emperors ruptured, with blood streaming out from their bodies.

“Go!” Shi Zhen’s confidence was greatly jarred as he quickly controlled the Godly Mt. Xumi to escape.

The Godly Mt. Xumi turned into a golden light streak, tearing into the void and vanishing from sight.

Seeing the Godly Mt. Xumi fleeing into the void, Dun Ei and the rest were too shocked to react. They were dumbfounded, and their faces paled as reality set in. Ever since Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had returned to rejoin the battle, the Radiance Divine City had been suppressed in the battle. Now that Shi Zhen, Old Monster Lun Zhuan, Old Crow Ancestor, and the others had fled, then what would be the outcome for the Radiance Divine City...?!

Dun Ei’s face was deathly pale. Space suddenly shook as a wave of overwhelming destructive power roared towards him. Dun Ei turned to look in alarm and saw the massive Ancient Heavenly Court speeding right at him.

“No!” Dun Ei screamed. He and the experts in the vicinity scattered in panic.

However, Dun Ei had barely fled and run afar when the Ancient Heavenly Court caught up to him.

Dun Ei and the experts close to him were knocked by the Ancient Heavenly Court, exploding to several blossoms of red blood mist right in front of the Treasure World, Poison World, Demon World, Fire World, and other forces’ experts. Even their souls were annihilated on the spot.

These experts were dumbfounded, looking at the ‘remains’ of Dun Ei, the ‘Lord of Radiance World,’ killed right before their eyes. The experts from the Radiance Divine City were especially jarred senseless.

Dun Ei’s... dead?!

On the other hand, after running through Dun Ei, the Ancient Heavenly Court had already locked onto its next targets—Yang Gang, Lu Kun, Chiyou, Qin Fan, and Chu Han.
