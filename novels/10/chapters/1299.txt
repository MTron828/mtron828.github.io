Tears moistened Yao Chi’s eyes as she could feel the warmth of Huang Xiaolong’s hand clasped around her hand. His words were reassuring as he told her that she was not dreaming and he was with her in person. Yao Chi said with moist eyes, “Xiaolong, when we were attacked on the way back, I really thought that I was going to die. At that time, I was scared that I won’t be able to see you anymore!”

Huang Xiaolong tightly embraced her for a long time without saying anything.

“That won’t happen. As long as I don’t permit it, you won’t die. No one could harm you!” Killing intent surged out from his body at the thought of sea tribes’ Guo Family.

Sea tribes’ Guo Family!

Yao Chi’s stayed quietly in Huang Xiaolong’s arms.

A while later, Yao Chi raised her head to look at Huang Xiaolong and asked, “Xiaolong, did you find the chaos five-colored heaven refining stones in the Clear Spirit World?”

A smile bloomed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he said, “I found it. Moreover, I also repaired the Pill Blending Tower successfully. And see, what do I have here?” He took out a chaos spiritual pill and showed it to Yao Chi.

“The Reverse Incarnation Pill?”

Yao Chi guessed correctly seeing the aureate chaos spiritual pill in Huang Xiaolong’s palm.

Huang Xiaolong nodded heavily as his smile widened, “It’s the Reverse Incarnation Pill!”

Tears trickled down Yao Chi’s face. She tightened her arms around Huang Xiaolong’s waist. She knew very well how difficult and dangerous it had been for Huang Xiaolong to refine this. He had to face innumerable dangers, and take life threatening risks, while exerting lots of time and effort over several years as he collected all the ingredients for refining Reverse Incarnation Pill. Once, Huang Xiaolong had even gone to one of the sea tribes’ Punishing Heaven City all by himself, just to search for one of the herbs that was needed to refine the Reverse Incarnation Pill.

This time as well, Huang Xiaolong had gone all the way to Clear Spirit World to find the chaos five-colored heaven refining stone, in order to repair the Pill Blending Tower, so that it could refine the Reverse Incarnation Pill!

All these thoughts raced through Yao Chi’s mind in a short amount of time, and her tears soaked through Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder.

When Huang Xiaolong saw that Yao Chi had turned into a rain woman, he was at a loss as to how to comfort her. When Yao Chi still continued crying after a while, he said, “Little Yao Yao, don’t cry anymore, okay?”

Yao Chi ‘puffed’ in laughter at Huang Xiaolong’s words like blooming petals after the rain. She put on a serious tone, “Who’s called Little Yao Yao? You’re Little Long Long.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly, and admitted, “I’m Little Long Long, okay now?”

Little Long Long?

Yao Chi was dumbfounded for a second, then she let out a peal of laughter, that shook her voluptuous bosom, bedazzling Huang Xiaolong’s world.

“Where are you looking at?” Yao Chi soon noticed there was something wrong with Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, and she blushed as she lightly pushed him away.

Huang Xiaolong smiled sheepishly as he moved closer to Yao Chi’s ear and said something. Immediately, her ears turned red all the way down to her neck.

Huang Xiaolong had breathed one sentence into her ear, reminding her that she had promised to give herself to him, whenever he would cure her Heart Devil Blood Curse.

Yao Chi suddenly laughed in vengeance seeing the smugness in his eyes, “I did say that, but I never specified that I would give it to you the moment you cured me.”

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded.

Yao Chi covered her lips and giggled happily as she watched Huang Xiaolong’s smugness wither away like green veggies.

“Silly goose.” She whispered into Huang Xiaolong’s ears like a siren, saying, “Don’t leave tonight.” Her voice was so low that it sounded like a mosquito.

Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment, then hot blood rushed to his groin.

’Don’t leave tonight?’

He would have lived his life in vain so far, if he couldn’t hear the implication of that sentence.

That night, Huang Xiaolong did not leave Yao Chi’s cultivation palace.

Not only that night, he was there for three consecutive nights.

On the morning of the fourth day, Li Chaosheng came knocking on Yao Chi’s cultivation palace due to Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s order to smack Huang Xiaolong back to the Divine Fortune Kingdom.

Huang Xiaolong realized that it was time to go, as he saw Li Chaosheng rigidly standing in front of him. There was no other option, but to leave for the Divine Fortune Kingdom, otherwise, his two Masters, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor might just come over to pick him by themselves.

Yao Chi was as red as a tomato standing a step behind Huang Xiaolong. She did not dare to look her Master Li Chaosheng.

Inwardly, Li Chaosheng gave Huang Xiaolong a thumbs-up of admiration.

Huang Xiaolong left Yao Chi’s cultivation palace and returned to the Fortune Divine Kingdom. Before he left, Huang Xiaolong had given Yao Chi a big batch of chaos spiritual pills, that even Li Chaosheng was green with envy. But Huang Xiaolong soon gave Li Chaosheng a batch of chaos spiritual pills as well, and Li Chaosheng, despite being a Fortune Gate Grand Elder, quivered with excitement.

As Zhu Yi’s permission was required for Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er to enter into the Fortune Divine Kingdom, Huang Xiaolong temporarily arranged them at the Myriad Gods Manor in the Fortune City.

In the Fortune Divine Kingdom, Huang Xiaolong headed to the Thousand Spirit Mountain on the little cow, and arrived at the Assembly Shrine, a while later.

He glanced at the Blood Eye Devil Stele that was as quiet as ever on the terrace, and a light glimmered in his eyes, ‘My cultivation is getting closer and closer to breaking through to Ancestor God Realm.’

As long as he breaks through to Ancestor God Realm, he would be able to refine this Blood Eye Devil Stele. Once he would complete refining the upper half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele, he would then find the lower half to complete the stele. At that time, his strength would have risen significantly.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong was standing in front of Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

Blood Knife Ancestor pointed at Huang Xiaolong the moment he saw him and half-reprimanded, “Are these two old men at all in your heart? You have returned many days ago, but stayed at your woman’s place for this entire time, while leaving us worried about you.”

A warm feeling filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart even though Blood Knife Ancestor was scolding him. Huang Xiaolong took out two boxes with a smile and said, “This disciple is at fault for it. This time going to the Clear Spirit World, disciple had gotten some good stuff, and these are gifts for Masters.”

Golden Brow Ancestor smiled warmly, “Our disciple knows how to be filial to his Masters, not bad.” He and Blood Knife both received the boxes from Huang Xiaolong, but neither were very much concern about the ‘good stuff’ that their disciple had mentioned. Based on their identities and statuses, they had a lot of good stuff.

But when they opened the boxes in their hands, both were astounded.These Fortune Gate Ancestors were shaking with excitement, like trees blown by a hurricane.

“G-g-grade ten spirit s-s-stones!”

“It’s ranked eighth on the ten wonder fruits of heaven and earth, the Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit!”

“And this! Is this-this, Eidolon Crystalline Rock?!”

The two old Masters shook even harder.

Each item they had taken out from the box was a priceless treasure ah, and each one of them was something that they had dreamed for a long time.

“Xiaolong, these are too precious.” A little while later, Golden Brow Ancestor said as he managed to rein in his excitement. “Moreover, you need these things more than we do, given your current cultivation.”

Blood Knife Ancestor’s excitement receded slightly after hearing Golden Brow Ancestor’s words. He agreed with Golden Brow, “That’s right, you need this Metal Fiend Fruit, and Eidolon Crystalline Rocks to raise your strength more than we do.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled as he reassured them, “Masters, don’t worry, disciple still has a lot of these items.”

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor exchanged a glance, then accepted Huang Xiaolong’s gifts. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Wait, you...? Late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm!” Suddenly, Golden Brow Ancestor stared at Huang Xiaolong fixedly, as if he had just discovered something unbelievable. His expression was full of shock.

Blood Knife Ancestor also scrutinized Huang Xiaolong, and his eyes widened in astonishment.

Their disciple, Huang Xiaolong, had actually broken through to late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm!

How is this possible?!

Before Huang Xiaolong had left Fortune Mainland, he was still an early Fifth Order Ancient God Realm, right? How long had it been?

Looking at Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s astounded faces, Huang Xiaolong gave a wry smile inwardly, ‘looks like I have a lot of explaining to do.’
