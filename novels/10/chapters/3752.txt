Chapter 3753: Finale II

Su Yan and Wang Meilan beamed when they heard Huang Xiaolong agree to work hard that night.

“Smelly brat, you’ve given your word.” Su Yan smiled at Huang Xiaolong. “If you don’t make an effort to give us a few grandsons and granddaughters, we won’t spare you.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “Don’t worry, Mother. Xiaofei, Li Lu, and the others will give birth to ten children, each of them!”

Each of us will give birth to ten children?!

Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and Yaochi were especially frightened, thinking how Huang Xiaolong would treat them that night, and their faces reddened further as their heartbeat raced.

Then they heard Wang Meilan’s voice. “How could each person giving birth to ten children be enough? Each of them must give birth to at least twenty!”

Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and Yaochi felt like fainting on the spot.

Huang Long, Huang Peng, and Huang Jiyuan smiled wryly in silence.

Huang Xiaolong could only grin in agreement. “Alright, twenty children each of them!”

He winked at Shi Xiaofei and the others, causing the women to blush even harder.

“Xiaolong, the Blazing Dragon Universe, except for the World of Departed Souls, and all other worlds were exterminated by Black Nether King. Can you see if…?” Blazing Dragon struggled internally before bringing up the matter to Huang Xiaolong.

“Master, don’t worry,” Huang Xiaolong reassured him. With a wave of his hand, all the vitality devoured by the Extermination Formation flowed in reverse, and as Huang Xiaolong’s hands continued to move, the returning vitality restored everything to what it used to be. The worlds that were destroyed, the continents, creeds and sacred lands were rebuilt like a movie being played backwards.

The mountains and rivers, spiritual beasts, mortals, and everything within these great worlds were restored until there was no difference from before.

Soon, the Blazing Dragon Universe was also restored completely.

Blazing Dragon, Huang Long, Pangu, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and others were wide-eyed with astonishment watching everything that transpired.

“This, the Universe God Realm is f*cking heaven-defying!” Pangu couldn’t resist muttering.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “In the future, I will be the fourteen universes’ heaven, and everything in the fourteen universes would live or die based on my thought.”

Pangu swallowed hard. “Xiaolong, that, erm, does that mean you can create anything we need out of thin air?”

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback, and then smiled as he answered, “You can say so.”

As the sovereign of the fourteen universes, the things he wanted to create merely requires a single thought.

Hearing it straight from the horse’s mouth, Huang Long, old dragon, and the others were jarred speechless.

Can create anything!

Does that mean whatever wishes they had could be fulfilled?

Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Long and Yilong wryly. “Father, Mother, just tell me what wishes you have. As long as it does not go against nature and harmony, I can fulfill them.”

Huang Long and Yilong’s hearts jumped. Could Huang Xiaolong see through other people’s thoughts as well?

Huang Xiaolong merely smiled as he went on, “The Unknown Space was exterminated by Black Nether King as well, so I’ll go over there now.”

Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi and the other women paled with worry when they heard that.

“Xiaolong, you’re going away again?” Shi Xiaofei asked with an obviously anxious face.

Seeing Shi Xiaofei and other women’s expressions, he understood their worries. “Don’t worry, it won’t take long, I’ll be back before you know it. It’ll be an hour at most.” He playfully reminded them as he continued, “I promised Mother that I’ll work hard tonight.”

Huang Xiaolong’s latter sentence made the women shoot him fierce glares with blushing faces.

Before Shi Xiaofei and the other women’s blushing glares, Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a blur, leaving a soft chuckle in the air. He left the Blazing Dragon Universe, and arrived at the edge of the First Universe where Unknown Space used to be in the next moment.

In the original location where the Unknown Space used to be was a broken and chaotic void, and there wasn’t a trace of vitality. Death qi loomed and faint scent of blood was left behind by the Extermination Formation.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand across the space in front of him, and immediately, strands of light broke through the darkness and enveloped the void. Slowly, the shattered Unknown Space began to piece itself back and it was finally restored to its original state.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the vitality that belonged to the Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Zhu Chen, Jian Wushuang, Tao Haner, and the others from the Extermination Formation and released them.

As Huang Xiaolong’s fingers danced in the air, the Devil Land, Limitless Land, Zhulan Land, and other lands recovered one by one.

It was like a magic show, and everything that had once disappeared was recovered and restored.

Mountain ranges on the great lands, the towering ancient trees as well as the smallest of seedlings, the insects, and spiritual beasts, everything reappeared. In the end, Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Jian Wushuang, Tao Haner, and many others were resurrected.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Jian Wushuang, Tao Haner, and all experts in the Unknown Space had incredulous expressions on their faces when they discovered they were resurrected.“We, we’re resurrected?!” Green Ghost asked in amazement as he checked his own body from top to bottom several times, pinching and squishing here and there.

“Correct, all of you are resurrected.” A voice brought them out of their state of shock. They turned to look at Huang Xiaolong who appeared out of nowhere.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong, Ferocious Devil fell loudly on his knees and kowtowed in gratitude. “Ferocious Devil thanks Lord God Universe for resurrecting my life!”

Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Jian Wushuang reacted when they saw Ferocious Devil’s action, and all of them followed, full of gratitude towards Huang Xiaolong. Their dao souls too had witnessed the scene where Huang Xiaolong had killed Black Nether King.

Huang Xiaolong had everyone stand up.

Tao Haner called out shyly to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord.”

Huang Xiaolong turned and smiled, looking at Tao Haner. “Haner, I’ll bring you back to the Blazing Dragon Universe with me after this.”

Now that he had broken through to Universe God Realm, Huang Xiaolong also thought through many things.

“Yes!” Tao Haner flushed with excitement and joy as she nodded her head.

“Wait here a while for me. I need to go to the Origin Universe,” Huang Xiaolong smiled and said seeing Tao Haner agree. He vanished from sight, and before the foot he raised fell in place, he was back at the Origin Universe almost instantaneously. In the past, he had crossed many obstacles and hardships to reach the Origin Universe, but now, it was merely the effort of a thought.

Huang Xiaolong spread his dao souls and soon found Yuan Fang, Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the rest. A cold snort escaped his lips, and he chose Yuan Fang as the first target.

At this time, Yuan Fang’s celestial palace was extremely lively. He was holding a banquet and had invited various experts from the Origin Universe.

Several hundred million years ago, Yuan Fang had managed to comprehend a supreme technique inside the Devil Mirror Palace, and his strength had improved further during this time. Yuan Fang felt his hope of breaking through to the Universe God Realm was closer within his reach. Due to this he was overjoyed and held a banquet.

In the banquet, the Lord of Ghost Desert raised his wine cup to make a toast at Yuan Fang in a respectful manner, “Congratulations Lord Yuan Fang in successfully comprehending a supreme technique. When Lord Yuan Fang breaks through to Universe God Realm, you’ll be the only sovereign of the fourteen universes!”

Buddha Sage Human Emperor and others also stood up, raising their wine cups for a toast, with a hint of flattery.

Yuan Fang laughed heartily, “I’ll borrow everyone’s auspicious words, and if I break through to Universe God Realm in the future, I, naturally, won’t treat anyone badly.”

The Lucid Race’s ancestor, Lucid Emperor, stood up and said, “I’ve heard that, upon returning, Black Nether King used the two Universe Source Stones he obtained to forge out an Extermination Formation to extract all thirteen universes’ vitality to help him breakthrough to Universe God.”

Hearing that, Yuan Fang’s unconcealed harsh snicker sounded through the hall. “Black Nether King is a fool through and through. Those methods are merely external resources. Even if he extracts the thirteen universes’ vitality a hundred times over, he wouldn’t be able to breakthrough into the Universe God Realm. To break through to that realm, one should comprehend supreme techniques like me, and advance.”

Yuan Fang barely finished his words, when a cold and derisive sneer sounded, “Like you? Yuan Fang, do you think you’ll be the one who breaks through to Universe God?”

Yuan Fang was startled by the familiar voice and slowly stood up from the main seat, looking towards the door. The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and others present also stood up and looked outside the hall. A young man was approaching at a leisurely pace.

Who else could it be but Huang Xiaolong?

“Huang Xiaolong, yo-you didn’t die?!” The first thought that came to Yuan Fang’s mind was that Huang Xiaolong didn’t die inside the Devio Mirror Palace’s Devil Light Region.

“I said it before on the day you besieged me that all of you will die the day I break through to Universe God!” Huang Xiaolong’s placid tone cut across the hall.

Huang Xiaolong strode into the hall.

“Listening to your tone, it’s as if you’ve taken that step and broken through to Universe God.” Yuan Fang mocked.

Merely several million years had passed since the last time the Devil Mirror Palace appeared, and he naturally did not believe Huang Xiaolong had advanced to Universe God in that short time.

He walked down from the dais towards Huang Xiaolong, “We forced you to death’s end that time in the Mirror Devil Palace, and today, we can kill you once and for all. Even without Black Nether King and Old Man Fortune, we can kill you just the same!”

He signaled others with his eyes, and the Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and others all spread out and encircled Huang Xiaolong.

Yuan Fang then activated the formation around the hall, and bright lights soared to the sky, completely trapping Huang Xiaolong.

Yuan Fang regained his confidence and composure.

“Huang Xiaolong.” Just as Yuan Fang wanted to speak, Huang Xiaolong directly struck his palm at Yuan Fang, burying him through the floor and into the ground.

The hall crumbled to the ground.

The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the rest were waiting for Yuan Fang’s order to attack, but they were flabbergasted after watching Yuan Fang slapped into the ground by Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong moved a little closer and looked into the pit in the ground where Yuan Fang was. “What did you want to say just now?”

Yuan Fang coughed up a mouthful of blood, and he was bleeding all over, even the corners of his eyes were cracked. Huang Xiaolong’s strike had completely shattered his dao heart and dao veins, and there were even cracks all over his great world.

He was horrified. “You, you’ve already…?!”

Huang Xiaolong stated without any emotion, “Not long ago, I killed Black Nether King.”

A chill ran down Yuan Fang’s back. The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the others felt their knees soften.

“What else do you want to say?” Huang Xiaolong asked as he peered at Yuan Fang.

A bitter and tragic smile flashed across Yuan Fang’s face but he was stubborn. “Kill me if you want to. Do you think I will beg you? Dream on!”

Huang Xiaolong struck out with another palm strike.

Violent quakes shook the entire great land.

That strike sent Yuan Fang to the very, very depths of the land. His physical body, and dao soul exploded from the force. As for the pieces of remains, everything was left deep underground.

“That’s nothing to dream about.” Huang Xiaolong merely glanced at Yuan Fang’s remains, and then looked away. “You think it’s funny, but I don’t.”

The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the others almost pissed themselves and quickly fell to their knees after seeing this.

“Lord Universe God, spare us!”

“We’re willing to submit to you. We were wrong!” The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and all present experts sobbed woefully. Stupid as they might be, but they too had guessed that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to Universe God.

Huang Xiaolong remained unaffected. “That day, you all besieged me, wanting to snatch my devil mirrors. Did you give me a chance?”

Huang Xiaolong’s killing intent did not escape the Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and other experts. All of them were prepared to flee for their lives, however, before they could turn around, all of them were sent deep underground with one palm strike. Just like Yuan Fang, their physiques, dao souls, and dao hearts shattered into particles.

After dealing with Yuan Fang, Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and other experts, Huang Xiaolong left the Origin Universe. However, Huang Xiaolong did not return to the Blazing Dragon Universe immediately but made a detour to the Firmament of the Universe.

Although Huang Xiaolong had killed Black Nether King, the White Feather King, and Old Man Fortune weren’t there. White Feather King and Old Man Fortune were currently at the Firmament of the Universe.

……

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong finished dealing with White Feather King, Old Man Fortune, and remnants of Universe First Race, and made his way back to the Blazing Dragon Universe. That night, inside the World of Departed Souls’ grandest palace, spring was blossoming where Huang Xiaolong showed the might worthy of a Universe God, and to attest to that were the endless screams and pleadings of several women….
