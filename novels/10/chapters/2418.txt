Chapter 2419: Undead Spirits!

Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As the tribulation clouds started to gather, terrifying pressure descended on Huang Xiaolong and the others.

Even the three True Saints managed to feel the horrifying pressure crushing down on Huang Xiaolong, and an expression of fear appeared on their faces.

“The tribulation clouds have only started to gather, but the pressure is astounding!” Yu Ming exclaimed in horror. “If this keeps up, wouldn’t a lightning dragon form?”

Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage chuckled when they heard what he said.

“Lightning dragon? When His Highness crossed the first tribulation he already attracted the lightning dragon!” Chen Zhi laughed. “The lightning dragon already reached four hundred feet in length.”

“What?! A four hundred feet lightning dragon on his first tribulation? Is that even possible?” Yu Ming’s eyes were wide with disbelief. Even the Eminent Elders of the Four Seas Holy Gate couldn’t believe their ears.

“The two of us were beside His Highness when he crossed the first tribulation. What do you think?”

Yu Ming felt his heart trembling as he raised his head to look at the dark clouds. A lightning dragon had already formed in the clouds, and it was growing bigger at a frightening speed.

“This...?” Yu Ming felt his mind going blank. “Wouldn’t that mean that the lightning dragon in the second tribulation would reach a length of six to seven hundred feet?! That would be equivalent to the seventh tribulation ordinary half-True Saints have to cross....”

“The more heaven-defying one is, the stronger the tribulation.” The Departing Sword Sage spoke. “The tribulation His Highness has to face is already stronger than the one Old Man Cangqiong faced in the past. In the future, he is definitely going to become the top expert in the Holy World.”

Chen Zhi nodded and followed up, “His Highness has unparalleled talent. He already formed the holy soul and should be able to take on this tribulation easily. However, the problem would be the subsequent ones. Tribulations would only grow along with one’s strength and when His Highness tries to break into the Primal Ancestor Realm in the future, I’m afraid...”

A Half-True Saint had to cross nine tribulations before they would be able to fight for the Saint Fate. hhen they entered the True Saint Realm, they would also have to cross nine tribulations!

Only by crossing nine tribulations in the True Saint Realm and fusing themselves with the Grand Dao would one be able to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm!

In the half-True Saint Realm, one had the chance to cross a tribulation for the second time if they failed the first. However, one wouldn’t be able to when they entered the True Saint Realm. If they failed, they would have to undergo reincarnation and start their cultivation from scratch. There were even some terrifying experts who had failed to cross the tribulation and their souls were scattered by the tribulation itself. If that happened, there was no need to mention reincarnating.

“That’s right. When he enters the True Saint Realm, he will face tribulations more terrifying than we can imagine. It will be extremely difficult for His Highness to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm....”

Yu Ming chuckled softly. “Don’t you think it’s too early to worry about that? His Highness is currently undergoing the second tribulation of the half-True Saint Realm!”

The lightning dragon in the clouds had already reached a size of five hundred feet, and it wasn’t going to stop growing anytime soon. When it reached a size of seven hundred feet, lightning bolts gathered around it, and it continued to expand.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they saw the strength of the tribulation.

This....

The lightning dragon only stopped growing when it reached a size of eight hundred feet.

“Eight hundred feet! This is His Highness’ second tribulation! How can this be?!” Yu Ming was at a loss for words.

He finally understood the feeling experienced by Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage when they had seen Huang Xiaolong crossing the first tribulation.

Huang Xiaolong had managed to attract an eight hundred feet long lightning dragon on his second tribulation, something that would terrify Seventh Tribulation half-True Saints.

While the lighting dragon no longer grew, black-colored divine flames appeared around its body.

“This... This is the God Exterminating Black Flame!” The Departing Sword Sage screamed. “Only Holy Princes with exceptional talent might be able to cause such a change when crossing their seventh tribulation!”

This was Huang Xiaolong’s second tribulation!

Boom!

As they stared in shock, the lightning dragon shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

Before it landed, Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul emerged. It scattered the lightning dragon along with the black flames around its body.

As soon as the dragon was scattered, it turned into streams of pure energy that poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate to circulate the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to refine the energy and strands of grand dao.

Holy light swirled around his body in an instant.

The Heart of Hell emitted brilliant rays of light as the strands of grand dao poured into it.

In the depths of the Holy World, a stream of mysterious grand dao tore through the void and fused with the Heart of Hell.

As for the energy contained in the holy pill he had consumed before the tribulation, it poured into the three Saint godheads.

The Holy Mandate Imprint on Huang Xiaolong’s head also started to shine with streaks of resplendent light.

The blade qi and sword qi that filled the surroundings scattered in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong had taken two entire months to cross the first tribulation. In the time he had spent, most of it had gone in refining the grand dao. This time, he failed to complete the assimilation of energy even after four whole months.

Only when the fifth month passed did Huang Xiaolong complete the fusion.

As soon as he emerged from the valley, Chen Zhi and the others stared at him with an intense gaze.

“Your Highness!” The three True Saints rejoiced. They rushed forward and congratulated him. “Congratulations on entering the Second Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly before gathering everyone.

This time, he could clearly feel the transformations to the Heart of Hell. In two more tribulations, Huang Xiaolong was confident that it would transform into an Inextinguishable Dao Heart!

However, a frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he thought about the strength of the tribulations. If this kept up, he would probably have to face a tribulation as strong as ordinary Half-True Saint’s ninth tribulation when he attempted his fourth!

As for further tribulations, Huang Xiaolong had no idea the extent they would reach.

“Whatever. We’ll cross the bridge when we get there.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. After obtaining the Dao Heart, he would refine his body with the grand dao. Even if he had to face further tribulations, he wouldn’t need to fear them in the slightest.

Boarding the Winged Dragon Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong charted a path to the headquarters of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate.

Two days later, they arrived.

They were greeted with a desolate plane and Huang Xiaolong shook his head when he thought of the once-prosperous Holy Gate. Rubble filled the land, and it didn’t take much for one to imagine the extent of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate’s strength from the size of their headquarters.

Huang Xiaolong no longer acted as he wished after entering the headquarters. Instead, he opened the Dark Holy Aura and hid the presence of the Winged Dragon Flying Ship.

They approached the inner regions of the Holy Gate with great care.

Huang Xiaolong also used all three holy souls to scout for information.

After crossing the second tribulation, Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes hadn’t just double in strength, but his holy soul could also penetrated the defenses formed by the sword and blade qi.

However, a roar rang through the air and the ground beneath them started to tremble before they could advance too deeply into the headquarters.

“It’s an undead spirit!” Everyone’s expression changed.
