Subjected to Huang Xiaolong’s cold and ruthless gaze, the remaining devil clan masters felt a frigid coldness shrouding their hearts, no one dared to utter a sound.

An hour later.

Most of the devil clan’s Grand Elders and Elders, with the exception of a small number that refused to submit, were reined in by Huang Xiaolong.

Whereas Mo Dingtian and Mo Zhenru met the same fate as Mo Su, sucked dry by Huang Xiaolong, same with the small number of Grand Elders and Elders who refused to submit.

Before killing Mo Dingtian, Huang Xiaolong scoured his soul. From his memories, he discovered the real purpose of the Devil Bead.

Inside a lavish manor within the City of Devils, two old men with complete silvery white hair sat in the main hall. Both of them exuded powerful auras; one had a stalwart built, while the other was almost bone-thin.

These two silvery white-haired old men were the Yelu and Beitang Families’ Ancestors.

Initially, when Huang Xiaolong decided to head to the City of Devils to challenge the Hellion Tower, he had planned to deal with these two old men and tie all loose ends related to the Yelu and Beitang Families. Later on, due to the troubles attracted by the Devil Bead, Huang Xiaolong delayed his plans in order to avoid the attention of the devil clan.

Thus, both of them were still alive today.

“Huang Xiaolong destroyed my Yelu Family, there will be a day when I make him wish he were dead!!” Resentment and wrath exploded in Ancestor Yelu’s eyes, turning crimson with bloodthirst.

By now, he already knew that the pillars of his Yelu Family had been killed by Huang Xiaolong.

Ancestor Beitang was also gnashing his teeth with hatred, “That’s right, even if we can’t kill Huang Xiaolong, we must torture his family to death one by one!!”

The Yelu Ancestor then said, “But, that Huang Xiaolong is probably looking for us as well, perhaps he already knew we’re in the City of Devils. Even that Devil Son Mo Su isn’t his match, we should go out less in the future...”

In terms of strength, both of them were much weaker than Mo Su.

Ancestor Beitang wasn’t perturbed at all, “You worry too much, I’ve quite a good relationship with the devil clan’s Grand Elder Mo Zhenru, and both of us have reached an agreement. He promised to give us Elder positions once we join the devil clan, moreover, we would be Grand Elder. At that time, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t dare do anything to us!”

Hearing that, joy brightened Yelu Ancestor’s face, relaxed slightly, “Is that true?!”

Ancestor Beitang laughed, “Absolutely true!’

Ancestor Yelu joined in with a hearty guffaw, “Indeed! Once we become Grand Elders of the devil clan, with the entire clan backing us, we would have no need to fear Huang Xiaolong. At that time, we could even borrow the devil clan’s power to deal with him!”

Right at this point, a cold snicker interrupted their jolly conversation.

Both Ancestor Yelu and Ancestor Beitang were alarmed.

Just as the two old men wanted to bark at the intruder, a bright light flashed in front of them as Huang Xiaolong’s figure appeared.

“Who are you?” Ancestor Beitang demanded, his face darkened.

Because neither of them had seen Huang Xiaolong nor a portrait of him, the two of them didn’t recognize him.

Huang Xiaolong scoffed at them, “Weren’t you two old men discussing how to borrow the Ancient Devil Clan’s power to deal with me?”

Ancestor Yelu and Ancestor Beitang’s faces tightened grimly, “You’re Huang Xiaolong?!”

“That’s me.” Huang Xiaolong replied with a stoic face.

The two elderly subconsciously moved backwards, away from him.

“Huang Xiaolong, we’re now Grand Elders of the devil clan, wh-what do you want to do?” Ancestor Yelu put up a strong front despite his quivering heart.

“That’s right, we know you’re very powerful, but the devil clan won’t let you go if you dare to kill us!” Ancestor Beitang barked, “If you kill us, you can just wait for the ancient devil clan’s vengeful wrath!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help laughing out loud. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ancestor Beitang’s forehead creased into a furrow, “What are you laughing at?”

What was so funny?

The sound of Huang Xiaolong’s laughter faded away, a gleam of bloodlust shone from the depth of his eyes, saying, “Hearing your threat, I’m really feeling a little scared now.”

Ancestor Yelu and Ancestor Beitang missed the bloodlust and sarcasm in Huang Xiaolong’s voice, thinking that he was genuinely wary of the Ancient Devil Clan and didn’t dare harm them. They inwardly breathed in relief.

As expected, in the two elders’ eyes, the Ancient Devil Clan was a giant force comparable to the Wangu Clan. As strong as Huang Xiaolong might be, he wouldn’t have the guts to go against the entire ancient devil clan alone!

However, before they could exhale in relief, Huang Xiaolong raised his hands, causing a whelming force to bind them and pull them toward him. His fingers gripped over Ancestor Yelu and Ancestor Beitang’s throats.

The two of them were merely Eighth Order Highgod Realm. In front of Huang Xiaolong, they didn’t have the slightest power to resist.

“Huang, Huang Xiaolong, you, y-you dare...” Ancestor Yelu struggled to speak, half choking as his face turned liver red.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned icy all of a sudden, “How about this? Since that Mo Zhenru already agreed to let you two join the devil clan as Grand Elders, I shall send you to hell now so you can ask him clearly.”

The two elders’ minds went blank at Huang Xiaolong’s words.

‘What did he just say?’

Does he mean...?!’

Huang Xiaolong stopped playing. His Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power feasted buoyantly on the blood essence and godforce from the bodies of Ancestor Yelu and Ancestor Beitang.

In a mere two breaths’ time, he had turned two Eighth Order Highgod Realm masters into dried corpses. With a flick of his index finger, two slivers of fire element godforce flew out, incinerating the remains until nothing was left.

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong vanished from the lavish manor.

After dealing with the Yelu and Beitang Families’ Ancestors, Huang Xiaolong returned to the devil clan headquarters instead of leaving the City of Devils. He summoned all the Elders and Grand Elders to the main hall and made changes to the existing devil clan rules.

Huang Xiaolong ordered these Grand Elders and Elders to kill all disciples who were dissatisfied or unwilling to submit.

Because he didn’t deliberately conceal his actions, very soon, the news of Huang Xiaolong having killed the devil clan Patriarch Mo Dingtian, Devil Son Mo Su, as well as taking control over the devil clan spread like wildfire through the entire City of Devils.

It was like a super thunderbolt over the City of Devils, emotions ran high in the city! The disciples of super forces and prominent sects in every corner of the city felt their sanity collapse hearing the news!

The ancient devil clan was the long-established power in the City of Devils, having existed for over three hundred million years!

A power that was comparable to the giant Wangu Clan was actually reined by Huang Xiaolong in a day’s time! Not to mention that Mo Dingtian was killed!

...

In the deep and quiet night.

Huang Xiaolong was standing in the devil clan’s main hall, looking at the soft moonlight. Inevitably, the faces of his family and Shi Xiaofei flashed in his mind.

Now, he had obtained the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s Chief position and took over the ancient devil clan. Everything was moving in the right direction, so it was time for him to bring his family and Shi Xiaofei over.

Still, there was one more lingering danger — the Ancient Devil Clan’s Ancestor, the previous Patriarch Mo Yishi.

From Mo Dingtian’s memories, this Mo Yishi went to cultivate in the Path to Hell more than a hundred years ago and had yet to return.

‘The Path to Hell.’ A light glimmered in his eyes. In that case, this matter would have to be put away until he went to rescue the Ascending Moon Old Man, then he would go looking for this Mo Yishi.

Early next day, Huang Xiaolong left the City of Devils, rushing back to the Black Tortoise Galaxy. He planned to move his family, Shi Xiaofei, and a few others to the Divine Dan City.
