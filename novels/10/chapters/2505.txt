Chapter 2506: I’ll Deal With Them

As she saw them approaching, Lin Xiaoying no longer put up a brave front, and she hid behind Huang Xiaolong.

“You… Even if you kill us, the Clear Snow Palace and the Holy Heavens will hunt you down!” Lin Xiaoying threatened softly.

Her threats were met with smirks from the two evil b*stards.

“Even if we kill you, no one will know,” You Lingzi snorted. He gazed at Lin Xiaoying’s chest with a lascivious gaze, and he continued, “The three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace really deserve their name. Hehe, relax. You won’t be able to die so quickly. I’ll let you enjoy the joys of the world before sending you to hell as Huang Xiaolong’s partner.”

“You!” Lin Xiaoying felt a trace of shame forming in her heart.

No matter what, she wouldn’t allow herself to be captured by You Lingzi. If push came to shove, she would give up on the trial and activate the light ring.

“Don’t even think about it.” You Lingzi sneered. “You won’t be able to teleport out instantly. With me here, you won’t be able to activate the light ring.”

Blood drained from Lin Xiaoying’s face, and she turned deathly pale.

When she thought about her fate when she landed in You Lingzi’s hands, she trembled uncontrollably. She knew that she would have to suffer a fate worse than death.

As she experienced endless despair and her body shook silently in fear, Huang Xiaolong tapped her shoulders, and he snickered, “You can relax now.”

Lin Xiaoying was stunned as she looked at Huang Xiaolong without realizing his intentions.

A smile formed on his face when he noticed the confused look on her face. “I’ll deal with the two of them.” If he had to be honest, the look on Lin Xiaoying’s face caused his heart to flutter with affection.

“You?!”

No one would believe a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint, who claimed that he could take on two True Saints on his own.

Dou Rui and You Lingzi were stunned when they heard what he said. However, they roared with laughter the next moment. You Lingzi’s laugh was especially creepy, and his laughter made one’s scalp go numb.

Huang Xiaolong ignored both of them, and he nodded at Lin Xiaoying. “That’s right. I’ll deal with them. Go stand at the side and watch how I do it.”

As soon as he spoke, Huang Xiaolong raised his arm and casually pushed her towards the entrance of the main hall.

Dou Rui turned to You Lingzi and chuckled, “Since he’s asking to die, I’ll deal with Huang Xiaolong first. You can handle Lin Xiaoying later.”

You Lingzi nodded his head and crossed his arms over his chest, and stood by the side. After all, it would only take a second for Dou Rui to deal with Huang Xiaolong. All he had to do was to prevent Lin Xiaoying from activating the light ring on her wrist.

As Dou Rui slowly walked towards Huang Xiaolong, the devil light around his body started to expand. It was as though he had turned into a giant devil, who had crawled out from the depths of the Devil Palace. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even someone like You Lingzi felt the pressure coming off Dou Rui’s body.

“Huang Xiaolong, it’s time to meet your maker!” With a cold glint in his eyes, Dou Rui sent a palm strike flying towards him.

Devil qi swept towards Huang Xiaolong, and it transformed into countless devil skulls. A single skull had the ability to take on an ordinary First Heaven True Saint!

“Devil Devours the Heavens!”

He had used one of the holy arts from the Devil Palace to deal with Huang Xiaolong.

Moreover, the ‘Devil Devours the Heavens’ wasn’t an ordinary holy art.

As she saw that the terrifying devil qi storm was about to hit Huang Xiaolong, Lin Xiaoying’s expression changed.

Just as she was about to make her move, a golden figure emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Holy might pierced through the heavens.

“Nirvana Purity Holy Art!”

Buddhas and countless holy figures filled the skies instantly,and they blocked out the sky. The black corpse qi that remained in the air scattered when faced with Huang Xiaolong’s buddhist qi.

Lin Xiaoying stared at the scene before her in disbelief.

Boom!

The giant devil skulls turned into dust in an instant. As for the devil light in the surrounding, it dissipated along with Dou Rui’s miserable shriek. As though a giant boulder from the heavens had slammed into him at a frightening speed, the clothes on his body ripped apart as he smashed into a distant mountain peak. As he pierced deep into the mountain face, Dou Rui’s body didn’t so much as twitch.

A giant tear could be seen on his chest, and the sight was shocking to behold.

Blood spurted out from the massive wound on his chest as the heavens and earth fell silent.

“Wa! Wa! Wa!” The only sound that filled the air was the cawing of an unknown bird that lived in the grave.

You Lingzi was stunned, and so was Lin Xiaoying. The hands that were crossed in front of You Lingzi’s chest fell to his sides as he stared at the scene before him in disbelief.

Lin Xiaoying fared a little worse. She seemed to have lost her soul, and she seemed to have turned into a motionless wooden block.

Previously, she had a ton of doubts about Huang Xiaolong’s ability to enter the leaderboards. She had planned to question him before You Lingzi and Dou Rui had arrived, but it seemed as though there was no longer a need to ask.

Huang Xiaolong had already displayed the reason behind his abnormal ranking.

“This… You… You have a holy soul at the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm?!” You Lingzi snapped back to his senses.

It was clear that he didn’t dare to believe what he just said. This couldn’t even be classified as a miracle!

One could only obtain a holy soul by successfully obtaining the Saint Fate! That was the law of the heavens! Huang Xiaolong’s possession of the holy soul had already shattered the laws of the Holy World!

Can it be because of the Holy Mandate Imprint? Was he able to shatter the rules of the Holy World because of that?!

A multitude of thoughts flashed through You Lingzi’s mind.

“Any last words?” Huang Xiaolong stared at You Lingzi expressionlessly as he asked.

A sneer formed on You Lingzi’s face in response. “Huang Xiaolong, even though it’s shocking for you to possess a holy soul, you can’t fight me. You will never be able to defeat me. After all, I’m not Dou Rui! Also, did you forget that we’re True Saint Realm experts with holy souls? You can’t kill us anyway!”

Like Cang Ping, You Lingzi was extremely confident in his ability to survive. Of course, no one could blame them. Every single True Saint would think that they were unkillable existences in front of Huang Xiaolong.

“At best, you’re slightly stronger than me. Yet, you won’t be able to stop me if I try to kill Lin Xiaoying. Huang Xiaolong, if you refuse to hand over half of the treasury, I’ll kill her!”

A triumphant smile formed on You Lingzi’s face.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh. You Lingzi didn’t know when to stop. In his eyes, You Lingzi was already a dead man walking. Why would he even think of using Lin Xiaoying to threaten him?

He was definitely tired of living.

Too lazy to explain himself, Huang Xiaolong released another holy soul.

As two holy souls soared into the skies, You Lingzi’s expression froze.

“Prosperity of the Dragons!”

“Nirvana Purity!”

Under You Lingzi’s shocked gaze, Huang Xiaolong began his attack.

The black corpse qi that had lingered in the grave for god knew how many billions of years, scattered in an instant.

Boom!

Two attacks, containing the power to flip the earth over, descended on You Lingzi.
