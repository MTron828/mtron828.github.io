The Dragon Shark Flying Ship stopped somewhere in the vast Divine World.

Huang Xiaolong and the rest of his group looked at a string of world surfaces hanging in the Divine World’s space in the distance. It seemed like these world surfaces were adhering to a certain rule At the very center of these stars was a large cluster of magnificent buildings.

There were several hundred millions of these palace-like buildings in this large cluster! The buildings looked complex, dense, bright, and glorious, exuding an inviolable air. Robust qi of nature was roiling and spreading outwards, enshrouding the entire cluster of these buildings.

This was the Fortune Emperor Palace!

And this cluster of buildings was the main Fortune Emperor Palace headquarters.

Whereas, the Fortune Emperor Palaces’ various halls were located on the surrounding world surfaces.

“This Fortune Emperor Palace’s foundation is not bad.” The little cow commented as she looked at the Fortune Emperor Palace in the distance.

With her knowledge, she could naturally tell that all these world surfaces were linked together, forming a grand chaos formation. Once this formation would get activated, it would even block an Emperor from barging inside the formation.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly turned to look at the little cow and asked, “After we enter the Fortune Emperor Palace, you better behave, or else don’t blame me if you get butchered.”

The little cow chuckled smugly, not taking Huang Xiaolong’s warning to heart. She retorted, “I should be the one saying that to you. Usually you are the one always running into trouble. I’m actually a passive cow.”

Huang Xiaolong blanked for a second, then remained silent out of speechlessness because the little cow’s words sounded... true.

But it wasn’t his fault. He wished for nothing more than to cultivate in peace, fulfill his responsibility, and not to provoke any trouble, but there was always someone coming to look for trouble with him...

A while later, the group flew towards the Fortune Emperor Palace’s main palace building. Huang Xiaolong rode on the little cow’s back.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong’s group came closer to the Fortune Emperor Palace area, they were stopped by a team of Fortune Emperor Palace’s patrolling disciples. Their tight expressions eased when they learned that Huang Xiaolong was a branch disciple and had come to participate in the assessment and selection of emperor rank godhead disciples. After verifying Huang Xiaolong’s identity with his identity, the patrol team led Huang Xiaolong’s group to one of the big world surfaces.

On the way, none of the patrol team’s disciples spoke, as they were keeping a shred of vigilance against Huang Xiaolong’s group. Though Huang Xiaolong’s identity and his identity token were both checked, they still needed to conduct a final verification process.

After arriving at a big world surface, the patrol team made arrangements for Huang Xiaolong’s group to stay in a small city’s tiny courtyard. Following that, they turned to leave without a word.

Huang Xiaolong frowned and stopped the patrol team’s leader. He asked about the registration, but the patrol leader’s tone was impatient, “Wait here. Someone will come to fetch you in a few days. In the meantime, just stay here obediently, and don’t run around. Also, don’t say I didn’t warn you if there’s an accident.”

Huang Xiaolong signaled Gui Yi with his eyes and Gui Yi responded by taking out several hundred top grade-seven spirit stones and placed them in the patrol team leader’s hand.

Top grade-nine spirit stones were too eye-catching, hence, Huang Xiaolong had exchanged some grade-nine spirit stones into ten billion top grade-seven spirit stones.

A smile bloomed over the patrol team leader’s face as he looked at the several hundred top grade-seven spirit stones in his hand. There was a little less impatience when he looked at Huang Xiaolong again. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What other matters does this brother want to know? As long as I know of it, and can speak about it, I would tell you.” The patrol team leader said smilingly.

“I’ve heard from my Master that Young Lord Zhu Feng from the same Vientiane World’s branch came to participate in the assessment, and has successfully passed it. Do you know about Zhu Feng?” asked Huang Xiaolong.

“Zhu Feng?” The patrol team leader repeated the name loudly, then shook his head and said, “Never heard of him, but if he has passed the assessment, then he would be our Fortune Emperor Palace’s outer sect disciple, I can help Brother to inquire about Zhu Feng.”

After Huang Xiaolong thanked the patrol team leader, he asked questions related to the latest situation of Fortune Emperor Palace’s recruitment. Huang Xiaolong was inwardly astonished when the patrol team leader told him that over twenty thousand emperor rank godhead disciples had been accepted so far.

Over twenty thousand! That’s a lot!

But after remembering that the Fortune Emperor Palace had more than eighty thousand branches, the number didn’t sound as shocking, anymore.

“... Then, is there a supreme rank godhead genius?” Huang Xiaolong asked the question that popped in his mind, as he got over his astonishment.

The patrol team leader nodded with a smile, “This time, our Fortune Emperor Palace has indeed recruited a supreme rank godhead genius, and it is not a secret. His name is Sun Shihai. Sun Shihai’s appearance not only alerted our Ancestors but our Emperor as well, and he was summoned to have an audience with them. I guess, once this round of recruitment ends after half a year, either our Emperor or Ancestors would accept him as their personal disciple!”

Supreme godhead genius!

Sun Shihai!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed.

“Oh right, there’s a rumor that our Emperor’s Disciple is also a supreme godhead genius, so it makes me wonder if our Emperor’s Disciple’s talent is higher or Sun Shihai’s talent?” Huang Xiaolong pretended to be surprised and asked the patrol team leader.

The patrol team leader shook his head, “The Emperor’s Disciple is not someone we can discuss.” As he spoke about the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple, there was trepidation, and fanatical worship in his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong asked a few more questions about the Fortune Emperor Palace before sending the patrol team leader off.

However, the patrol team leader was only a Fortune Emperor Palace’s outer sect disciple, therefore, he was not able to answer much.

The patrol team left half an hour later.

Huang Xiaolong had learned from the patrol team leader that after five days, once his identity was confirmed, someone would come to take him to the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Supreme Harmony Hall for registration and verification of his bone-age, godhead, and cultivation.

In thirty years, the Fortune Emperor Palace had recruited five batches of emperor rank godhead disciples, and the upcoming registration was going to be the last batch.

After finishing this assessment and successfully becoming the Fortune Emperor Palace’s outer sect disciples, this batch of disciples would then be participating in a ranking competition. If Huang Xiaolong’s performed outstandingly during the ranking competition, then he a chance of catching the eye of Fortune Emperor Palace’s Elders, Grand Elders, and even the Hall Masters. Being accepted as a personal disciple by any of them was nothing short of ascending to the skies in a single leap.

On the other hand, mediocre performance would only mean not catching the eye of any Elder, Grand Elder, or Hall Master. And that disciple would be left to lead the mediocre life of an outer sect disciple.

After understanding these situations in detail, Huang Xiaolong stayed at the small courtyard and cultivated with ease while waiting with the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the rest until his identity was being verified.

Five days went by in the blink of an eye. Huang Xiaolong’s identity was confirmed, and a Fortune Emperor Palace’s inner sect disciple named He Lai came to take Huang Xiaolong to the Supreme Harmony Hall to register for the assessment.

As the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the others were not allowed to follow Huang Xiaolong, they had to stay back at the courtyard, and wait for Huang Xiaolong’s news.

Huang Xiaolong secretly gave He Lai ten thousand pieces of top grade-seven spirit stones, therefore, He Lai’s attitude was polite along the way.

Due to the Fortune Emperor Palace’s size, it took half a month for Huang Xiaolong to reach the Supreme Harmony Hall.

Huang Xiaolong was expecting to see a big crowd at the Supreme Harmony Hall, but he was surprised to see the opposite. Only ten or so emperor-rank godhead disciples from other branches were lined up to register for their assessment inside the Supreme Harmony Hall.

This was mainly because each branch’s emperor-rank godhead disciples were arriving at different times, not to mention, emperor rank godheads were scarce to begin with.

Upon arriving at the Supreme Harmony Hall, He Lai told Huang Xiaolong to go line up to register, and have his godhead rank and cultivation verified. He Lai also gave Huang Xiaolong a communication talisman and told him that he would consider him as his Junior Brother if Huang Xiaolong managed to pass the assessment. He also told Huang Xiaolong to go look for him if there was any trouble in the future, once he became He Lai’s Junior Brother. Perhaps, this was a bonus for those ten thousand top grade-seven spirit stones.
