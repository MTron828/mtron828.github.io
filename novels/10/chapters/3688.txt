Chapter 3689 – Battling the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death

He wouldn’t be able to get the assistance of the Ferocious Devil when the day of reckoning came!

The Ferocious Devil had a combat power of more than 29 billion marks of grand cosmos energy! The battle would be much more manageable with his help!

Next, Huang Xiaolong asked about matters regarding the Universe First Race.

Of course, Zhu Chen only had limited knowledge on the Universe First Race. He knew that there were thirteen kings among them and he had a general understanding of their strength. That was about it.

He had no idea what any of the kings cultivated.

An hour later, Huang Xiaolong left the Naihe Bridge with Zhu Chen.

The five monster kings followed closely behind.

With their presence, no creatures dared to attack the group on their way out.

Right before they left, Huang Xiaolong turned around to stare in the direction of the end of the bridge. He decided to return after breaking through to the peak of the grand completion stage!

He would meet the Ghost Devil King in the future!

Zhu Chen and the others might not be able to leave the Unknown Space, but Huang Xiaolong learned that the monster kings of the Naihe Bridge weren’t restricted by the curse!

If he subdued the Ghost Devil King in the future, he would definitely gain another powerful ally!

After traveling for a year, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at the entrance of the Naihe Bridge.

When Zhu Chen saw the entrance of the bridge, his heart thumped in excitement. If Huang Xiaolong hadn’t arrived when he did, he might never have been able to leave the Naihe Bridge!

After they left, they appeared before the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation.

Huang Xiaolong sealed off the altar before entering the bridge, stopping any evil ghosts from running out into the Unknown Space.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

They would talk about other matters when they left the Netherworld.

With Zhu Chen and the five monster kings behind him, Huang Xiaolong went towards the seventeenth level.

However, Huang Xiaolong took out the Universe Boat as he felt that they were traveling too slowly.

When Zhu Chen saw the giant boat appearing above his head, his jaws dropped.

The five monster kings gave similar reactions.

“Universe Boat!” Zhu Chen yelled.

“Yep.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “If we travel alone, we’ll be too slow.”

After he spoke, he got on the ship.

Everyone followed closely behind.

Looking at the giant ship they boarded, Zhu Chen and the others felt a sense of disbelief rising in their minds.

Was that really the Universe Boat?! A trace of doubt formed in Zhu Chen’s mind.

However, that doubt was soon cleared.

The moment Huang Xiaolong activated the grand formation on the ship to propel them forward, he realized that the Universe Boat was the real deal! It was too f*cking fast!

With their shocking speed, they tore through the Netherworld.

Because of Huang Xiaolong’s seclusion in the Yin Soul River, his understanding of the grand dao increased by a huge amount!

Zhu Chen’s understanding of the grand dao wasn’t something Gui Chi or the others could compare to! Even Jian Wushuang was far from him!

As for the five monster kings, they were probably a little better than Zhu Chen.

When Huang Xiaolong discussed the dao with them, he felt a whole new door opening before his eyes! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Several dozen years passed in the blink of an eye.

Even though it had only been a short amount of time, Huang Xiaolong gained a whole new understanding in the intricacies of the universe and the grand dao.

Feeling that something was off, Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls to scan the situation around the Universe Boat.

He quickly discovered the experts who entered the Netherworld.

Even though he hadn’t met the Dragon Overlord or the God of Death, he recognized them immediately.

He wasn’t surprised to see that they were present. After all, he didn’t hide his tracks after leaving the Yin Soul River. He knew that they would follow him into the Netherworld.

It seemed as though the Reversal Sword was an extremely alluring treasure. The experts of the various regions didn’t care about the evil ghosts at all as they killed their way into the Netherworld in search of him.

Zhu Chen and the others felt that it was odd that Huang Xiaolong slowed down all of a sudden.

“Lord, this…” Zhu Chen asked.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at him from the corner of his eye and chuckled, “The Dragon Overlord and the God of Death came.”

“?!” Zhu Chen was struck dumb by his revelation.

“I obtained the Reversal Sword in the Yin Soul River and the news probably reached them. The masters of several great regions, along with the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death brought their armies along to the Netherworld.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

“Several region masters?!” Zhu Chen gasped.

Huang Xiaolong quickly kept the Universe Boat as he stood in the middle of the air to wait for their arrival.

Several moments later, Zhu Chen and the five monster kings detected their presence.

Even though Zhu Chen was one of the supreme overlords in the Unknown Space, his expression changed when he saw the powerful army charging towards them.

The Dragon Overlord and God of Death quickly noticed the group.

The two supreme overlords stared at each other silently as they were surprised that Huang Xiaolong would wait for them to come.

They couldn’t understand why Zhu Chen was part of Huang Xiaolong’s group. Did the two know each other?!

Moreover, they were shocked to discover the presence of the five giant monster kings.

Every single one of them possessed an aura no weaker than Zhu Chen!

“The monster kings of the Naihe Bridge?!” The Dragon Overlord gasped.

Why would they be together with Huang Xiaolong and Zhu Chen?! Moreover, they seemed to be extremely respectful when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Even though they were confused, they led their armies towards the group. It didn’t take long for them to run into each other.

The two groups stood opposite each other and the armies of the various factions stared at Huang Xiaolong’s party in confusion.

Stepping up slightly, the Dragon Overlord growled, “Zhu Chen, we’re here for the kid. This has nothing to do with you.”

Before Zhu Chen could say anything, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to stop the man. He stepped forward and flew towards the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death.
