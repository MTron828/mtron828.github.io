If the Immortal Hall and the Death God Sect were to join hands, even the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe would hesitate when dealing with them. Hence, Chen Bin didn’t take anyone else seriously other than the young master of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

After hearing what Chen Bin said, the concerns in Feng Qi’s heart dissipated, and he smiled. “How can I bother brother Chen Bin to take care of such a small matter? I can settle this myself.”

Chen Bin smiled, “Alright.”

Feng Qi asked the guards captain about Huang Xiaolong’s mount’s strength. After some consideration, he sent out a summoning signal to the second and third stewards, Yang Ruitian and Yu Jifei, from the city lord’s mansion. He requested that they make a trip to the Death Volcano immediately.

There were a total of five butlers in the city lord’s mansion.

Both the second steward, Yang Ruitian, and the third steward, Yu Jiefei, were Emperor Realm experts. One of them was a mid-Eighth Order Emperor, while the other was a late-Seventh Order Emperor.

The two of them were more than enough to handle the situation.

Not long after, both of them arrived in front of Feng Qi and the others.

Feng Qi didn’t dally and quickly briefed them on the situation and Huang Xiaolong’s mount’s strength. He brought everyone to the lowest level of the crater.

“This brat dares to continue staying in the cultivation room after injuring someone from the city lord’s mansion!” A pretty lady next to Chen Bin groaned, “Maybe he really has some kind of backing.”

This pretty lady was called Wang Qingying, and there was a butterfly tattoo at the corner of her eye. She belonged to the Black Butterfly Race, and every single member of this ancient race had an extreme innate charm.

The Black Butterfly Race was ranked eighth in the Spirits World, and even though they were incomparable to the Immortal Hall and Death God Sect, they possessed rather incredible strength. As for Wang Qingying, she was the daughter of the current patriarch of the Black Butterfly Race.

“So what if he has some kind of backing?” Chen Bin smiled disapprovingly, “In the three worlds of Hell, there is no lack of young masters who have some kind of backing.”

Very soon, everyone arrived at the number nine cultivation room’s door at the lowest level of the crater.

“Go, open the door.” Feng Qi said to the captain.

There was naturally more than one key to the room. Other than the key in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, there were two more keys.

“Yes, young master.” Once the captain arrived in front of the door, he took out the jade key. He circulated his godforce and inserted the key into the keyhole on the door.

In an instant, the door swung open.

The instant the door opened, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, who had its eyes closed, felt something unusual. It snapped its fiery eyes open.

In the same instant, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes slowly opened as he stopped cultivating.

After taking a look at the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, the gazes of Feng Qi, Chen Bin, and the rest of them fell on Huang Xiaolong, who was sitting in the middle of the array.

“Mid-Fourth Order Emperor,” Yang Ruitian looked at the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin and said.

Fang Qi relaxed quite a bit after hearing that.

“Brat, did you injure my men?” Feng Qi looked coldly at Huang Xiaolong as he pointed to the guard captain.

Huang Xiaolong replied indifferently, “That’s right.”

A frigid expression formed on Feng Qi’s face. “Very good.” He then turned to Yu Jifei and said, “May I trouble Steward Yu to throw them out of the room? Don’t kill them yet; I need to ask him some things.”

Yu Jifei nodded his head, and his right hand turned into a claw as it abruptly stretched towards Huang Xiaolong and the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. Two large grey handprints appeared above their heads. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A white light flashed out of nowhere and destroyed the two handprints.

Everyone was startled.

What was that white light? Even though they felt that it was some sort of divine artifact, none could identify it.

Huang Xiaolong stood up and walked towards the door.

Yu Jifei’s expression changed. In the end, he retreated a few steps and allowed Huang Xiaolong and the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin to walk out from the cultivation room.

“Young Master, you are...?” Feng Qi looked at Huang Xiaolong indifferently as he said in a solemn tone.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t speak, but the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin threw a token over in his stead.

Once Feng Qi saw the token, his entire face changed. There was a character etched on top of the token—‘Nether’.

“Netherworld King’s Organization!”

Everyone yelled out in shock.

For the past few years, with the appearance of the new King of Hell, the might of the Netherworld King’s Organization had soared sky-high. No one dared to go against them.

For a moment, everyone was ‘stuck’ in place.

Chen Bin was the first one to regain his senses. He looked at Huang Xiaolong as he smiled coldly, “No wonder you are so arrogant. It turns out that you are from the Netherworld King’s Organization. Who’s your master? Which Great Commander do you serve under? Jiang Fenghuang? Lu Kun? Could it be He Lianfeng?”

Huang Xiaolong’s status was high from Chen Bin’s perspective as he had a mount in the mid-Fourth Order Emperor Realm. It was very likely that he was a direct disciple of a Great Commander. Since there were only three Great Commanders stationed in the Spirits World, he named all of them.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the question before throwing Chen Bin an indifferent gaze. “Before I change my mind, you better leave now.”

Everyone was startled.

Chen Bin’s face sank, and he smiled, “Brat, do you really think that I won’t dare to move against you just because you are from the Netherworld King’s Organization? Even if your master is Lu Kun or Jiang Fenghuang, you will still have to give an explanation for injuring someone related to the city lord’s mansion.”

Huang Xiaolong let out an "oh" and looked at the other party with interest. Huang Xiaolong saw the insignia on his robe and said, "You’re from the Immortal Hall."

Chen Bin said proudly, “That’s right, I am the third young master of the Immortal Hall, Chen Bin.”

However, the moment he finished speaking, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin raised its leg and kicked his chest. With a miserable shriek, he flew out and smashed into the stone wall across the crater.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Nobody had expected the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin to attack so suddenly.

“I don’t care if you belong to the Immortal Hall or Death God Sect. After ten breaths of time, I don’t want to see any of you here,” Huang Xiaolong said calmly.

“Brat, you are looking to die!” One of the mid-Seventh Order Emperor ancestors from the Immortal Hall regained his senses and yelled in rage. He sent out a palm that contained raging death qi, and the roars of countless skeletons filled the air.

However, the shocking thing was that the death qi contained a kind of immortal aura. It was as if this death qi would last forever.

Not long after the Immortal Hall’s ancestor attacked, the white light from earlier appeared once again and clashed with him.

A miserable cry could be heard in the next instant as the ancestor cried out in pain. He retreated, and everyone could see a hole in his palm.

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

Even the mid-Eighth Order Emperor from the city lord’s mansion, Yan Ruitian, had eyes filled with terror.

“There’s still six breaths of time left.” Huang Xiaolong said with indifference.

Everyone’s face changed drastically.

“Take brother Chen Bin and leave.” Feng Qi gritted his teeth and said gloomily.

Of course, he wasn’t planning to let the matter rest here. He wanted to investigate Huang Xiaolong’s identity before making the next move.
