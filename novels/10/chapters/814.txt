Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The old man presiding over the auction was a famous high-level auctioneer in the White Tiger Galaxy.

The opening item of the auction was an ancient green longsword with eleven previous owners, all Highgod Realm masters; the longsword’s body was cast out of extremely rare Divine World fine iron with intricate defensive formations inscribed on the it’s body. Hence, the moment it was brought up to the auction stage, more than a few cultivators made high bids for it.

At the end, the green longsword was sold for 230 million Baihu coins to a Patriarch of a super force from the White Tiger Galaxy.

Toward this kind of divine swords, divine spears, divine knives ah, Huang Xiaolong held less than tepid interest. He didn’t lack these things, all of them sitting quietly inside his Asura Ring, thus he didn’t participate in the bidding.

Following that, there were some rare million-year-old medicinal herbs, brand new divine weapons, and armors, rare Divine World iron and steel, even the beast cores of a few perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm demonic beasts.

More than a dozen items were sold.

Huang Xiaolong sat silently, disinterested, for there were just too many of these things inside the Hailstone and Xuanji Treasuries.

Shi Xiaofei, Liu Yun, and Qi Wen also watched in silence, rarely saying a word.

However, when it came to the nineteenth item on auction, exclamations and gasps of shock echoed in the square, including Huang Xiaolong and his three companions.

The auctioneer introduced, “Next, our nineteenth auctioned item is a batch of tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets personally refined by this term’s Pill King Huang Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong was bewildered hearing the auctioneer’s introduction, so were Shi Xiaofei, Liu Yun, as well as Qi Wen.

In private room twelve, the young Mirage King was stunned for a second. Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, Gudu Ye, Wang Na, and the remaining Highgod Realm masters in the room were dazed for a moment.

Even Yelu Tianhao and Beitang Zi inside private room nine failed to react for a moment.

A seemingly long moment of silence later, the square was stirred up.

“A batch of tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellet refined by Pill King Huang Xiaolong!”

“I heard the Huang Family members’ cultivation improved so fast because they consumed this Exalted Divinity Pellet that Huang Xiaolong personally refined!”

It could be said that Huang Xiaolong’s reputation had definitely preceded many old characters who had risen to fame in the last ten thousand years.

In the four galaxies, if someone said they had never heard of Huang Xiaolong, they would be despised as ignorant and ill-informed.

Although the majority of people present in the auction didn’t know Huang Xiaolong, they had heard of his feats that were recorded in the sacred history of the four galaxies.

Compared to the excited crowd, Shi Xiaofei leaned in closer to Huang Xiaolong, a mischievous smile on her face, “You refined this batch of tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets?”

Shi Xiaofei’s feather-like warm breath tickled Huang Xiaolong’s ear.

Huang Xiaolong answered helplessly, “I also don’t know ah.”

This batch of pellets definitely wasn’t put on auction by Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t lack money, thus he need not auction anything, so to speak. However, since the auction house dared to take them out, they must have verified their authenticity, therefore the pellets couldn’t be fake.

Who exactly was it that auctioned off the tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets that he refined? Names of people he had given the pellets flashed in his mind one by one.

Those from the Alchemist Grandmaster Association? He did give a few batches of tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellet to the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Chief Chen Ye, and also to several Association Elders like Lin Pinghai.

“This batch of tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets are absolutely genuine, they have been verified by all three of our auction house’s high-level appraisers. There are only twelve of these tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets, and each pellet is of the finest quality tribulation grade.” The auctioneer made an elaborate pause, then added, “The bidding price starts at 1.2 billion.”

1.2 billion!

Quite a few cultivators sucked in a breath of cold air, even Huang Xiaolong was surprised. He didn’t expect a batch of tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets that he refined to start at such a high price.

There were twelve pellets, that averaged to 100 million for each of them. Moreover, this was merely the initial bidding price. Following this path, Huang Xiaolong estimated they could reach a selling price of 2 billion.

“You don’t need to do anything in the future, just sit at home to refine tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets every day and you can still be the wealthiest man in the four galaxies.” Shi Xiaofei leaned close to Huang Xiaolong’s ear, suggesting in jest.

Huang Xiaolong responded, “As long as you’re by my side, I don’t care about being the number one wealthiest man in the four galaxies.”

Shi Xiaofei couldn’t help blushing despite Huang Xiaolong’s cheesy words.

Sitting not far from them, Qi Wen laughed as she said to Huang Xiaolong, “If your Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother’s mouth was half as sweet as yours, how wonderful that would be.” She rolled her eyes at Liu Yun at the end.

Liu Yun smiled bitterly, ‘What is this? Skewered while lying down?’

Right after the auctioneer announced the bidding price, someone called out: “1.5 billion!”

Everyone was dumbfounded, turning to look at private room nine.

Huang Xiaolong merely glanced at private room nine, thinking that things might get interesting.

Inside private room nine, Yelu Tianhao watching Beitang Zi with a frown on his face, “What are you doing bidding for that dog Huang Xiaolong’s pellets?”

The person who called out 1.5 billion was none other than Beitang Zi.

As far as Yelu Tianhao knew, Beitang Zi’s family did not have a need for pills. Furthermore, as a core disciple of the Beitang Family Patriarch’s line, the pills he usually consumed weren’t any worse than the so-called tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets.

But Beitang Zi smiled, “Since Huang Xiaolong can win the four galaxies’ Pill King title, the pellets he refined have some research value.”

Yelu Tianhao solemnly stated, “I want three pellets.”

“Sure.” Beitang Zi did not hesitate.

However, right at this time, someone called out: “5 billion!”

5 billion!

Beitang Zi, Yelu Tianhao, and everyone else in the square wore a bewildered expression, turning toward private room twelve.

A cold light glinted in Beitang Zi’s eyes. Covering it with an amiable grin, he said to Yelu Tianhao, “Looks like we aren’t the only ones interested in this batch of tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets. If so, I shall play a little with them.” He turned forward, calling out: “8 billion!”

8 billion!!

A loud thump sounded in everyone’s hearts, however, before they could recover from the shock of those 8 billion, from private room twelve came another bid: “10 billion!”

10 billion!! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Everyone was shocked to the point of feeling numb. Shi Xiaofei, Liu Yun, and Qi Wen were looking wide-eyed at Huang Xiaolong, there were actually people willing to spend 10 billion to buy a batch of twelve tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets? Did this person hit their head on a furnace?

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong seemed to be in deep thought.

At the end, the guest in private room twelve spent 40 billion to buy twelve tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets refined by Huang Xiaolong.

This result roused a tsunami of an uproar amongst the cultivators present.

A batch of medicinal pellets fetched an exorbitant price of 40 billion, this was the highest record in the four galaxies’ many years of history.

It would be hard for Huang Xiaolong not to be famous.

Sitting there, Huang Xiaolong secretly shook his head, a wry smile on his face.

Inside private room nine, Beitang Zi had an ugly expression on his face, it wasn’t because he couldn’t afford 40 billion, but such an enormous sum had exceeded the research value of the pills. He could only give up close to the end.

“Private room number twelve.” Beitang Zi muttered under his breath, purple lights glimmered in his eyes.

The auction continued, over twenty items followed.

These twenty over items fetched a more reasonable price in accordance to market value, none of them having a price that shocked the four galaxies like Huang Xiaolong’s tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets.

“The next auction item is our final item, the star of this auction, a Heavenly God’s godhead fragment!” The auctioneer raised his voice.

They have waited for this moment!

All of a sudden, a feverish light appeared in everyone’s eyes.
