Chapter 2349: The Cangqiong Holy Manor’s Seventh Floor

“You already know about the Cangqiong Holy Manor?” The Heavenly Master was slightly surprised. He chuckled as he spoke, “Since you are aware of the Cangqiong Holy Manor, then you should also know that the Cangqiong Holy Manor is passed down from Cangqiong Old Man.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and responded with a ‘yes.’

Cangqiong Old Man, the number one person in the Holy World!

In other words, Cangqiong Old Man was the undisputed most powerful person in the Holy World!

Some people said that the Clear Snow Palace Master Xue Lingyun was Cangqiong Old Man’s disciple-in-name.

“Master, I’ve heard rumors that the Clear Snow Palace Master Xue Lingyun is Cangqiong Old Man’s disciple-in-name?!” Huang Xiaolong asked casually to satisfy a moment of his curiosity.

Tyrant Chu snickered, “It’s just hearsay. In truth, Cangqiong Old Man does not have any disciple, and he definitely does not have a disciple-in-name. However, Xue Lingyun is Cangqiong Old Man’s foster daughter.”

This piece of information was shocking for Huang Xiaolong. The Clear Snow Palace Master Xue Lingyun was actually the Cangqiong Old Man’s foster daughter!

This was truly heaven-shaking news.

Lord Long nodded and added, “Not many people know about this. It’s enough that you’re aware, so don’t go telling it to others.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded in compliance.

“The reason we mentioned the Cangqiong Holy Manor to you is because the Cangqiong Holy Manor is going to open its doors.” The Heavenly Master explained, “There are ninety-plus years until the next time the Cangqiong Holy Manor opens its doors, which is less than a hundred years. There are fortuitous adventures waiting inside the Cangqiong Holy Manor. Not only are there holy spiritual herbs, but also numerous high-level holy martial arts, and primal artifacts. We hope you will make the best of this opportunity.”

“The problem is that there are many layers of dangerous restrictions inside the Cangqiong Holy Manor, and the smallest careless mistake could be the cause of death of many half-True Saint experts, and the mortality rate for those below half-True Saint strength is a hundred percent,” said Elder Crow.

Huang Xiaolong understood the meaning of the Heavenly Master and Elder Crow’s words. His four Masters were worried his strength was insufficient to ensure his own safety by the time the Cangqiong Holy Manor opened.

After all, there was less than a hundred years left until the Cangqiong Holy Manor opened. Even though Huang Xiaolong had the Holy Mandate Imprint, and complete dao saint godheads that could continuously improve, along with a high-grade origin pills to aid his cultivation, the chances of him advancing to half-True Saint before that was bleak.

Huang Xiaolong pondered the matter, and then asked, “Master, what realm of half-True Saint is considered safe to enter?”

Lord Long took it upon himself to answer Huang Xiaolong, “The average Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint’s strength is sufficient to pass the first three floors of Cangqiong Holy Manor. Even if the risks are high if you can advance to First Tribulation half-True Saint, the first three floors of Cangqiong Holy Manor shouldn’t pose a problem for you with your talent.”

The Heavenly Master continued, “However, the Cangqiong Holy Manor has seven floors in all, and holy spiritual herbs and high-grade holy martial arts can mostly be found on the sixth floor. If you want to reach the sixth floor, you must break through to Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm at the very least.”

“What about the seventh floor?” Huang Xiaolong could not help asking.

“The seventh floor?”

The question caught the four Primal Ancestors off guard.

A bitter smile stained Tyrant Chu’s smiling face, “I’ll tell you honestly. No one has ever stepped onto the seventh floor because one must find the key to open the door to the seventh floor in order to do that. Unfortunately, no one has ever succeeded in finding the key till this day.”

“Key? Shouldn’t the key be inside the Cangqiong Holy Manor?” Huang Xiaolong asked the doubt in his mind.

Elder Crow shook his head then explained, “The key should be inside the Cangqiong Holy Manor, but no one has had the luck of finding it yet. Frankly speaking, the four of us have also entered the Cangqiong Holy Manor, but none of us had the good luck of finding the key.”

But the Heavenly Master encouraged, “Although the four of us didn’t find the key, you probably might find it. The seventh floor contains Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance as well as the Blade of Cangqiong. There might even be some Cangqiong Pills refined by Cangqiong Old Man himself.”

The four of them continued to tell Huang Xiaolong what they knew about the Cangqiong Holy Manor.

“Master, what about the next time the Saint Fate appears?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“The Saint Fate will appear a little over a hundred years from now. The earliest, it could be around a hundred years and the latest can be in two hundred years. We too wish you can grab the opportunity of the Saint Fate appearing this time. If you miss the Saint Fate this time, it’s hard to say when the next Saint Fate will appear.” The Heavenly Master’s tone turned serious.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Even though he had the Holy Mandate Imprint which would make it easier for him when he broke through to True Saint Realm in the future, there was one crucial element for his breakthrough, which was successfully winning the Saint Fate!

The Saint Fate was something intangible, yet it was also something very real.

Between periods of long years, the Holy World would condense a new Saint Fate. Once a new Saint Fate appeared, it pulled the peak Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints into a whirlpool of frenzy. Whoever won the Saint Fate, and successfully integrated with it, they could step into True Saint Realm! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Thus, the main issue was that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation needed to reach the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm before the Saint Fate appeared!

According to the norms of Holy World, only after going through nine holy tribulations could one’s soul be suited to integrate with a Saint Fate. Otherwise, during the integration process, the cultivator would face a backlash from the Saint Gate that would result in his divine soul’s complete destruction.

“We understand that we are requesting you to do the impossible by requiring you to raise your cultivation to Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm as we want you to participate in the competition for the Saint Fate this time around. r But the four of us hope that you will strive for it, and break through to the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint.” Lord Long said solemnly.

Despite saying so, Lord Long did not have much confidence in Huang Xiaolong.

It had taken the Heavenly Master over ten thousand years to advance from First Order Venerable to True Saint Realm. Regardless of how powerful Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads could evolve to, there didn’t seem to be any hope Huang Xiaolong could enter Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint in a little over a hundred years.

The way the four of them saw it, the chances were lower than ten percent.

Elder Crow took over, “The Cangqiong Holy Manor opens before the next Saint Fate appears. Therefore, if you can find the key to the Cangqiong Holy Manor’s seventh floor, and obtained the Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance and Cangqiong Pill, perhaps, there is hope for you to breakthrough to Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint before the Saint Fate appears.”

If Huang Xiaolong could get the holy pill and Cangqiong Pill, it would greatly increase his chances of advancing to the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint before the Saint Fate appeared by thirty to forty percent.

A wry smile colored Huang Xiaolong’s expression. At the moment, he couldn’t even say for sure if he could advance to First Tribulation half-True Saint before the Cangqiong Holy Manor opened. Then again, even if he did enter First Tribulation half-True Saint, he might not make it to the sixth floor, much less the seventh floor. Then what were the chances of finding a key that no one had ever found?

Shortly after, Huang Xiaolong saluted the four Primal Ancestors and left the Primal Ancestors’ space.

Before Huang Xiaolong left, the Heavenly Master said that he would let Wu Ge pass the origin treasures, origin spiritual pills and other congratulatory gifts the various holy gates and forces had given during the previous day’s ceremony to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart was somersaulting in happiness upon hearing that.

After all, there were almost four hundred thousand forces who had come with gifts!

Not to mention, just the lowest grade origin spiritual pill these forces had gifted was high-grade, level-seven origin spiritual pill!

How many origin treasures and origin spiritual pills were there?!

How many holy spiritual jade stones were there?!

The Clear Snow Palace had even gifted a holy spiritual pill!

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected the Heavenly Master and other Masters to give him all the gifts. Then again, he understood these gifts could not enter their eyes. Moreover, they would be too embarrassed to ask him for the holy spiritual pill the Clear Snow Palace had given him.

“How high are Huang Xiaolong’s chances of raising his cultivation to First Tribulation half-True Saint? What do you guys think?” Lord Long asked as he watched Huang Xiaolong slowly walk out of his sight.

The Heavenly Master’s obsidian eyes turned profound as he spoke, “Advancing to First Tribulation half-True Saint shouldn’t be a problem for him, but advancing until the Fourth Tribulation to enter the sixth floor might be asking for too much, and as for the seventh floor...” His words trailed off, ending with a shake of his head.

He meant that the chances of Huang Xiaolong finding the key was no better than zero, and even if Huang Xiaolong found the key, he probably did not have the strength to reach the final destination.

Tyrant Chu also shook his head, “He might even break through to the First Tribulation half-True Saint in time, much less the Fourth Tribulation, zilch, I tell you!” Then his tone changed, “However, why is that kid so adamant to cultivate inside the Fire and Ice Lake?”
