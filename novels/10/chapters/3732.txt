Chapter 3733: Half-Step Universe God!

 

Once they were out of the picture, the Universe Boat’s next target became those ancient ancestors and patriarchs of the various races.

The speed of the Universe Boat was terrifying, to begin with. With Huang Xiaolong’s grand cosmos energy to supplement it, it didn’t take long for the Universe Boat to arrive before the others.

Miserable shrieks filled the skies.

Countless experts were sent flying in an instant.

If Huang Ren and the others couldn’t escape their fate of being beaten badly, there was nothing more to say about those experts.

The Universe Boat was basically an unstoppable existence. Coupled with Huang Xiaolong’s unparalleled strength, it could wipe away anyone in its path! Not to mention the fact that he was using it to intentionally crash into the experts present.

In two breaths of time, nearly half of the experts were dealt with.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong sent the Universe Boat straight into the light barrier that was supposed to keep him in the city.

Bang!

It was as though he tore a hole through the heavens as a giant gap was formed in the light barrier around the city.

Darkness could be seen in the space outside the barrier.

Huang Ren and the others felt the world crumbling around them when they saw how powerful Huang Xiaolong really was. Their hearts went cold and their legs went numb.

They used almost every single resource in their treasury to create the formation around the city. They thought that it was extremely sturdy and no one would be able to break out of it. Now, it failed to take a single strike from the Universe Boat.

When the Universe Boat was done with the formation, Huang Xiaolong turned it around and sent it towards the Huang Ren trio again.

Their expressions changed and they no longer dared to take the strike head-on. They fled in three different directions.

As soon as they disappeared from their spot, the ship smashed deep into the ground. 

The entire continent was blown apart as a bottomless abyss formed. 

Experts at the level of Huang Ren might have broken through the 29 billion mark, but they were terrified when they saw what happened.

It was lucky the three of them dodged, otherwise, they would have turned into meat paste.

The Universe Boat was the strongest universe treasure! It was ranked number one in terms of offensive abilities, defensive abilities, and speed!

No matter how strong their bodies were, they wouldn’t be able to resist the Universe Boat!

Huang Xiaolong recalled the Universe Boat and stared at the three of them coldly. When he was about to send the Universe Boat into them once again, Zhou Fu yelled, “Brother Huang, wait a minute! We have something to tell you!” 

“?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the three of them with a raised eyebrow.

“Brother Huang, we were too rash! We offended you by accident as we only wanted the Universe Source Stone to go against the Universe First Race!” Shi Jian continued, “Brother Huang, please forgive us!” 

“That’s right! We heard that they wanted to destroy the Thirteen Universes again. All of us wish to stop them, and our common enemy is the Universe First Race!” Huang Ren explained, “If we fight among ourselves now, they will be extremely happy to see us kill each other off!” 

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Are you sure you wish to obtain the Universe Source Stone in order to stand against the Universe First Race?” 

“Yes… Of course!” Zhou Fu panicked. “However, Brother Huang is a supreme being! The Universe Source Stone will be much more useful in your hands!” 

“From what you’re saying, you guys don’t want the Universe Source Stone any longer, is that right?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“We don’t want it anymore!” The three of them replied in unison.

“Aren’t you planning to take revenge for your grandson?” Huang Xiaolong asked Huang Ren.

A stern look appeared on Huang Ren’s face, and he snapped, “He went too far by offending Brother Huang! I can’t blame you for his death!” 

Huang Xiaolong remained silent as he looked at the three shameless b*stards standing before him.

All three of them clenched their fists tightly as they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

“Whatever the case, I haven’t been able to move my muscles. Since you’re able to put up a fight, let’s exchange pointers!” 

Their expressions changed instantly.

The Universe Boat expanded once again.

…

Half a day later…

The entire continent was turned into rubble from the battle.

Huang Ren and the others were beaten so badly that even their mothers wouldn’t recognize them. 

After torturing them for a little while longer, Huang Xiaolong finally let them off.

It was easy for Huang Xiaolong to defeat the three of them, but it wouldn’t be possible for him to make them submit to him.

Turning around, Huang Xiaolong left.

Yang Dingsheng brought his son along as he thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely.

Allowing them to get up, he made them lead the way to the headquarters of the Yang Lightning Race. When Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer arrived, they received a shocking welcome from the race.

Even though the old ancestor of the Yang Lightning Race didn’t take part in the battle, he had long since heard the outcome.

When they arrived, the White Deer didn’t waste any time, and it saved Yang Dingsheng’s wife immediately. In a single day, Yang Dingsheng’s wife recovered completely.

Staying in the Yang Lightning Race, Huang Xiaolong entered the Universe Boat to continue his cultivation. At the same time, he learned that Old Man Fortune wasn’t in the Fortune Space.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Where can he be?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. It was no wonder the old man didn’t appear during the battle.

“I heard that he left the Fortune Space several tens of thousands of years ago.”

“Go look into his whereabouts,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Alright!” The White Deer nodded before leaving.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong got the White Deer to pay attention to Huang Ren, Shi Jian, and Zhou Fu before entering seclusion.

Now, he had to break into the half-step Universe God Realm as quickly as possible! 

He completely refined the White Flower after several dozen thousand years, and he tossed the Universe Source Stone into the eye of the formation before comprehending the images in the Nameless Devil Mirror.

After nearly a hundred thousand years, pillars of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. It contained an endless amount of power as Huang Xiaolong experienced a complete transformation.

He finally entered the half-step Universe God Realm!
