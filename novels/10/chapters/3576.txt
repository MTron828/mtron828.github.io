Chapter 3577 – Sword Dao Gate

As a branch outlet of the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce in a small city like the Falling Water City, the attendant of the shop wasn’t even at the True Saint Realm! He jumped in fright when he saw the bunch of dao coins Huang Xiaolong tossed onto the counter.

There were many important people in the main hall doing their business, but they were also shocked by Huang Xiaolong’s actions.

Dao coins were created by experts in the God of Creation Realm and every one of them contained the grand dao laws. Huang Xiaolong casually tossed out more than three hundred dao coins, and the grand dao qi that filled the air scared everyone present.

“Lord… What… What do you wish to buy?” The attendant stammered.

“I’m looking for a courtyard in the Falling Water City. The larger the better.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Lord, please give me a moment to report this to the branch director!” The attendant responded before scuttering away.

It didn’t take long for Chen Dean, the branch director of the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce to appear before Huang Xiaolong. Even though he was a branch director of the largest chamber of commerce in the celestial empire, he was merely a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

In Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, he was weaker than an ant. However, he was the strongest expert in the city!

When Chen Dean arrived before Huang Xiaolong, he became extremely respectful. He introduced every single residence in the city to Huang Xiaolong.

Without thinking too much about the details, Huang Xiaolong tossed out a little more than ten thousand dao coins to purchase the most expensive residence in the city.

It didn’t cost much to buy a place of residence in a place like the Falling Water City. After all, it wasn’t a major city. Neither was it extremely important to the celestial empire. Of course, everything was relative to Huang Xiaolong’s wealth. If he were to count it in terms of holy bills, the manor would cost more than a hundred million holy bills!

Settling the paperwork for Huang Xiaolong, Chen Dean wanted to personally escort Huang Xiaolong over to the courtyard. It was too bad he was rejected by Huang Xiaolong. All he had to do was to pass the control tablet of the manor to Tao Hang.

Chen Dean didn’t dare to say much and he quickly fulfilled Huang Xiaolong’s request. He bowed respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong before leaving, “If you require any assistance, feel free to call on me any time.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly before leaving the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce with Tao Hang and Tao Han’er.

Not too long after they left the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce, they were surrounded by a group of experts hailing from the Zhang Family.

“Second young master, that’s him!” Caretaker Yun hid behind a young man and he pointed towards Huang Xiaolong.

The young man was the second young master of the Zhang Family, Zhang Shaohuang. He was one of the strongest experts among the later generation of those born in the city. As an expert at the high-level True Saint Realm, he wasn’t afraid of anyone.

Zhang Shaohuang walked towards Huang Xiaolong, but his gaze was fixed on Tao Hang. “Old Man Tao, how dare you look for someone to beat up my subordinate?”

Tao Hang stood silently behind Huang Xiaolong as he ignored the kid.

“Oh? Looks like you found someone really impressive. Humph!” Turning to Huang Xiaolong, he snorted, “Did you come from outside the city? Which family are you from? Let me remind you, my brother-in-law is the direct disciple of the Sword Dao Gate’s patriarch!”

There were countless factions in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire, and the Sword Dao Gate was a creed level entity. Even though they weren’t at the peak of the power pyramid, they were definitely a strong faction. In the region, the Sword Dao Gate was an invincible existence!

“Sword Dao Gate? Never heard of them.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “All of you should get out of my sight right now. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind killing you all.”

Zhang Shaohuang stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence, and he narrowed his eyes. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so calm after hearing about their relationship with the Sword Dao Gate. A trace of suspicion formed in his heart.

“Humph. What audacity.” A voice rang through the air. Zhang Shaohuang turned to the source of the voice and a look of joy formed on his face.

“Brother-in-law! Why did you come?”

From afar, dozens of experts strode towards Huang Xiaolong’s group. The person who came was Xu Qi, the direct disciple of the Sword Dao Gate’s patriarch. The others were core disciples of the Sword Dao Gate. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Even though Xu Qi was the youngest disciple of the Sword Dao Gate’s patriarch, his talent was something that far surpassed Zhang Shaohuang. He was a Primal Ancestor at the late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. His combat strength was comparable to peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors. In the Falling Water City, he was a supreme existence.

Noticing Zhang Shaohuang’s greeting Xu Qi nodded, “I came out of the sect to carry out a mission with my junior disciples. I came over as it was along the way. Who would have thought that I would meet a show off like that the moment I arrived.”

A chilly light flashed in his eyes as he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

According to what he knew, the Falling Water City was a city on the outskirts of the celestial empire. No one there was worthy of his attention!

The experts of the Sword Dao Gate slowly closed in on Huang Xiaolong.

As Zhang Shaohuang followed closely behind Xu Qi, he continued to stir sh*t. “Brother-in-law, you might not know, but this b*stard has been running his mouth off since a long time ago.”

“Since you haven’t heard of my Sword Dao Gate, I’ll let you experience our strength!” Xu Qi looked at one of the core disciples beside him and winked.

The disciple might not be at the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, but he was a high-level Primal Ancestor regardless. He walked towards Huang Xiaolong and a snort left his lips. The sword in his hand slashed upwards, and a myriad of sword lights surrounded the city. Every single expert in the city could feel the terrifying sword qi gathered in the air.

It was too bad the sword light failed to reach Huang Xiaolong. When they arrived a meter away from him, they spun around and shot back towards the core disciple.

When the sword lights disappeared, the body of the core disciple turned completely stiff. Blood started to leak out from his body as it stained the ground red.

“Junior Brother Chen!” Xu Qi and the others gasped.

Zhang Shaohuang, who was a mere True Saint Realm expert, stared at the corpse with his jaws agape. The experts of the Zhang Family were equally stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden revelation of strength.

“Who are you?! Which sect are you from?!” Xu Qi suppressed the shock in his heart and asked.

“Sect? I’m acting alone.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Factionless?

That would make him a wandering expert!

Xu Qi heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He was afraid that Huang Xiaolong came from an even stronger faction than the Sword Dao Gate. If that was true, he would have provoked an extremely terrifying existence. If only he knew that Huang Xiaolong alone was scarier than all the factions in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire put together…
