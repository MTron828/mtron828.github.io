Chapter 2969: Eternal Devil Heart

The Heart Devourer Twin Devils’ devilish aura enveloped spread through the streets, and the crowd felt as if there was a great force suffocating them, and even Yan Bubi, Qiu Ruopeng, Liu Ran, the rest of the group had to back away several times to feel better.

At this moment, the Twin Devils stopped converging, and both men’s mid-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm momentum was fully released, and merely this momentum had pulverized the buildings in their immediate surroundings into dust.

A mid-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable’s aura was boundless when released, and it was like ten thousand roaring galaxial rivers that could drown everything, break everything, and wash away everything in their path.

Not only the Dragon Fish City, but even the Levitating Sacred Land where the city was located swayed uncontrollably like a boat in the sea storm. Cracks and fissures opened through the lands, cities broke from the ground, despite the efforts of Dragon Fish Creed’s experts at these locations to strengthen the protective array formations.

The rounded Twin Devils stared at Huang Xiaolong through his narrow eyes, “Huang Xiaolong, you don’t know the horror of a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable until you reach that realm! At Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, those Seventh, and Eighth Esteem Dao Venerables are rubbish, and you are also rubbish in my eyes!”

“Don’t assume that you’re capable of resisting Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables because you defeated the Poison Bodach’s, Nine-headed Tree Demon’s, and Sword Venerable’s insignificant disciples!” The tall Twin Devil looked at Hunag Xiaolong like he was looking at a dead man. “Looking at the sake that you’re the Son of Creation, I will give you a chance. Kneel and offer up the Tree of Beginning, then beg for your life, or the ends of those disciples will be your ending!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed. Before anyone reacted, his figure disappeared from the spot, and he was in front of the Heart Devourer Twin Devils in a split second with his twelve high-order Saint Fates, three dao souls, Huang Long Bloodline, three small worlds’ cosmos energy, and Dao Body of Heaven and Earth activated to the limit. He punched out with his fists simultaneously.

BOOM!

Two overwhelming waves of fist force roiling forth were akin two ancient rivers that had arrived after traversing through time and eras, lighting up the world. The sight of two shining rivers of fist force were forever imprinted in the minds of all experts present.

Dong!

The rivers of fist force landed on the Heart Devourer Twin Devils, and their bodies stiffened momentarily before they were knocked flying all the way out of the city’s perimeter. They were still being pushed away by Huang Xiaolong’s fist force, flying further away, passing by city after city, one grassland after another…

In the end, the rivers of fist force slammed the Heart Devourer Twin Devils until the edge of Levitating Sacred Land! It left the Heart Devourer Twin Devils plummeting down the mountain range at the edge of Levitating Sacred Land when its energy was exhausted.

The world was silent!

Witnesing this sight, there was shock and terror and there were nothing but shock and terror in the crowd’s mind and soul!

“...This, this!” Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, and Qiu Ruopeng repeated, tongue-tied, pointing with trembling fingers in the direction the Heart Devourer Twin Devils were sent flying. In truth, they were shaking from head to toe, looking pale as a corpse and were wide-eyed in disbelief.

The two men were the mid-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm Heart Devourer Twin Devils who had been notorious since ancient times, and they were the same Heart Devourer Twin Devils who had devoured countless experts’ inextinguishable dao hearts, the big devils that could send experts scurrying for their lives at the mere mention of their names. But they were actually sent flying by Huang Xiaolong!

“That, that’s only because the Heart Devourer Twin Devils were careless for a moment.” Qiu Ruopeng came up with an excuse.

Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, and the others were too speechless to speak.

Careless for a moment?

Even if the Heart Devourer Twin Devils were careless for a moment, how many experts could actually injure them? Much less reducing them to the current state…

Those hidden in the dark coveting Huang Xiaolong’s Tree of Beginning who had not made a move were looking at Huang Xiaolong with horror.

“Fifth, peak early Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!” someone blurted out.

When Huang Xiaolong attacked at full force, his cultivation realm was immediately exposed. Many experts were shocked to find that Huang Xiaolong had advanced to peak early Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

“At the time of the Creation Ceremony, I saw it clearly. He was a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable!” someone exclaimed in disbelief.

“That’s right, I was present too, and at that time, the Son of Creation was only a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable. There’s no mistake about it!”

“Were you guys mistaken that he was a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable at that time because now, he’s already a peak early Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable? You’re saying that the Son of Creation merely used three hundred years to advance to peak early Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm?!”

While everyone was discussing the matter of Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation, in a single step, Huang Xiaolong was standing in the air above the Heart Devourer Twin Devils who were struggling to get up, covered in soil and dust all over then. The armors on them were broken in various places, revealing the enormous fist imprints on their chests, and at this moment, both of them were glaring at Huang Xiaolong in fury, astonishment, and denial.

“If I’m rubbish in your eyes, what are you two then?” Huang Xiaolong provided the answer, “Can’t even compare to rubbish!”

Can’t even compare to rubbish!

Everyone on the Levitating Sacred Land heard Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Sharp devilish aura burst out from the Heart Devourer Twin Devils’ eyes, a sinister bloodthirsty aura roiled around them, and merged together. A world boundary of blood formed behind them and expanded rapidly, and everywhere were blood souls and devilish lights. Gradually, an enormous bloody heart as big as a sacred land appeared in the world boundary’s sky. The bloody heart was covered densely with grand dao laws, and devil runes, one look and one couldn’t help but feel dread.

“It’s the Eternal Devil Heart!” A voice cut across the silence.

The Eternal Devil Heart had a rumor surrounding its existence. It was said that when the world was created, a devil’s heart of nefarious nature was also born, specially by absorbing all kinds of nefarious energy and devil energy between heaven and earth. The Heart Devourer Twin Devils had happened to find this Eternal Devil Heart, and they had refined it. Because of obtaining the Eternal Devil Heart, their strength rose exponentially, and began devouring the inextinguishable dao heart of people they killed.

Some people claimed the Heart Devourer Twin Devils were controlled by the Eternal Devil Heart, and they were devoured experts’ inextinguishable dao hearts to supplement the Eternal Devil Heart.

When the Eternal Devil Heart appeared, the entire Levitating Sacred Land seemed to have been dragged into a prison of blood with no way out. Without warning, nefarious and evil thoughts emerged in everyone’s heart.

“Huang Xiaolong, you will soon be turned into a supplement to the Eternal Devil Heart!” the Heart Devourer Twin Devils shouted at the same time, and their tones and mannerism were slightly different from before, as if their minds were taken over by the Eternal Devil Heart.

“Die!” the Heart Devourer Twin Devils shouted and their hands formed claws, targeting Huang Xiaolong’s chest. The moment they attacked, two enormous devil’s claws as big as a continent came at Huang Xiaolong.

The sea of devil qi roiled, bloodthirsty aura soared to the sky, and vengeful souls were everywhere. This was no ordinary devil qi, nor was it the usual bloodthirsty aura, but this was the Eternal Devil Heart’s devil qi and bloodthirsty aura that was capable of demonizing and devouring everything.

As the devil’s claws came at him, brilliant radiance emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body and bloomed in the sky. The dragon of creation reared its head as Huang Xiaolong leaped into the sky and punched out with absolute frost power that was infinitely close to perfection.
