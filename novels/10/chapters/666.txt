Huang Xiaolong added another hard kick at the end of his sentence. However, feeling far from satisfied, he actually summoned the Godly Mt. Xumi, shrunk it to the size of two fists put together, and actually flung the entire Godly Mt. Xumi at Li Jiarong’s family jewels.

Li Jiarong hovered between life and death. His screams rang continuously in the square, alternating loud screams, and weak groans came from the stone chamber. The elite disciples who heard it in the hall outside felt goosebumps all over.

A few elite disciples who couldn’t resist the curiosity in their hearts sneaked into the inner hall and craned their necks for a peep into the stone chamber.

When they saw a little golden mountain hammering repeatedly at Li Jiarong’s groin, all of them froze stiffly on the spot.

After a while, when Huang Xiaolong finally felt that it was time to stop, he kept the Godly Mt. Xumi away. Before he left, he threw a piercing cold glance at Li Jiarong, “Don’t be so sure that old witch Wang Na will be able to succeed the Institute Principal’s position, it still isn’t her turn! Don’t ever let me see your face again, otherwise I’ll hammer you every time I see you!”

Li Jiarong’s blood boiled with anger at Huang Xiaolong’s words, warm liquid gushing up his throat. Then he spat a large mouthful of blood before fainting into oblivion.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and left, walking out from the stone chamber.

When Huang Xiaolong appeared in the hall outside, the surrounding elite disciples retreated in fear, getting as far away from Huang Xiaolong as possible. Huang Xiaolong ignored the expressions around him, speeding away from Red Flood Peak once he was out of the inner hall.

Returning from the Red Flood Hall to the Golden Dragon Peak, Huang Xiaolong made a trip to his parents’ courtyard, informing them that he would be leaving to the Wintry North World to visit Shi Xiaofei. The rest of the day was spent accompanying his parents.

Early morning the next day, with his parents and the others sending him off, Huang Xiaolong departed for the Wintry North World.

Through the Black Warrior City’s transmission array, Huang Xiaolong made several transfers the entire way until he reached the Tanggu World, then flew to the Wintry North World from there.

The dark vast space, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette sped forward at high speed.

The last time Huang Xiaolong made the same journey, he was but a peak late-Fifth Order God Realm. Now, he was already a Seventh Order God Realm, thus his speed had greatly increased compared to the last time.

However, Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to reach his destination. As he sped across space, he greedily absorbed the lightning force hidden in the deep void, enhancing the clarity of his soul.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Wintry North World in ten days’ time from the Tanggu World.

Being in Wintry North World, looking at its endless stretch of white snowfields and the gentle drifting snow, a familiar and dear feeling washed over Huang Xiaolong.

Thinking that he’d be able to see Shi Xiaofei very soon, and that Shi Xiaofei had probably reached the third stage of the Moon Summoning Rhyme, Huang Xiaolong could barely contain the excitement in his heart.

Cutting short his dallying, he flew at high speed to the land of new moon on his sword.

Very soon, he flew past the Wuke City he had seen last time. Looking down from above, Wuke City was still just as dreamlike. Moments later, Wuke City turned into a small spot behind him, no longer in sight.

At Huang Xiaolong’s current speed, it wouldn’t take him more than three hours to reach the land of new moon.

All of a sudden, while Huang Xiaolong was flying toward the land of new moon, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s voice sounded in his mind, “Why are there powerful energy fluctuations coming from the land of new moon? There are people fighting!”

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback.

“Old Dragon, are you sure?” Huang Xiaolong blurted out in haste.

Dragoon Emperor Ao Taiyi answered solemnly “There are people fighting, it seems like something has happened!”

In that split second, Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated. Pushing the immortal true essence in his dantian, accelerated to the land of new moon in a streak of fire.

The drifting snow in Huang Xiaolong’s path was all pushed away. In the end, all snow within a hundred zhang radius from Huang Xiaolong vaporized into fog, blooming in midair.

...

In the land of new moon.

Shi Xiaofei swung the sword in her hand, shooting out a curtain of sword qi, forcing back several Zhang Family experts trying to close in on her, but her furious gaze was glaring at Zhang Han not far away: “Zhang Han, I’ll kill you!” As she leaped forward in the air, her sword thrust to the front, aimed at Zhang Han.

However, before Shi Xiaofei’s attack landed, it was parried by Chen Yun, who was standing beside Zhang Han. Punching out an Eight Extremes Star Collapsing Fist, numerous flickers of starlight burst forward, forcing Shi Xiaofei to an embarrassed retreat.

Zhang Han watched Shi Xiaofei with a cold sneer on his face, “Little slut, you didn’t expect that such a day would fall on you, right? Now that Crazy Lady Yang Yi is not here, I’ll wait and see who will come to save you. But don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I’ll slowly teach you what a man tastes like, very soon you’ll know how amazing I am!” Zhang Han laughed maniacally.

Chen Yun followed suit, “Shi Xiaofei, my family’s Young Lord will definitely satisfy you!” As he spoke, Chen Yun continued to attack Shi Xiaofei, who staggered back several times.

“You scum!!” Shi Xiaofei was furious.

Facing Chen Yun’s waves of attack, Shi Xiaofei was powerless to resist. If she wasn’t wearing the divine armor that Huang Xiaolong gave her before, she would have collapsed earlier.

Even though Chen Yun had yet to capture the slut after so many attacks, Zhang Han was neither worried nor hurried. He stood there leisurely, folding his hands over his chest as if he was enjoying a show.

It was a while later when he signaled one of the Zhang Family Elders behind him to go capture Shi Xiaofei.

Despite having some protection offered by the divine armor that Huang Xiaolong gave her, against an Eighth Order God Realm, it was futile. In less than a breath’s time, she was shackled in that Elder’s hands.

Looking at Shi Xiaofei’s helpless figure in front of him, a wicked smile spread across Zhang Han’s face as he moved closer to her. His gaze was fixed on Shi Xiaofei’s heaving bosom, “Tsk tsk, this part of you has grown bigger compared to before.”

Shi Xiaofei’s beautiful eyes were frigid cold: “When my Master returns, she’ll definitely kill you!”

Zhang Han laughed heartily, “By that time, I’ll already be hiding inside our Zhang Family’s forbidden land. What can your Master do to me then?”

Right at this time, a chilling cold voice sounded: “You won’t have that chance!”

The voice was too abrupt that everyone was dazed for a second.

Before everyone’s eyes, the drifting snow halted as a figure appeared in front of them.

Shi Xiaofei’s beautiful eyes became red, staring fixedly at the figure that had just appeared. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

When Zhang Han saw the newcomer’s face, he laughed in delight instead, “So it’s you punk! Hehe, you appeared right on time, I was just feeling regretful that there is no one here to watch a good show. Then you appeared!” His voice turned cold and ruthless, “Punk, the shame that old man gave me that year, I’m paying it back a thousand times on your body!”

That scene from the Winter Moon City’s restaurant was imprinted in Zhang Han’s mind. That was the greatest humiliation of his life, he could never forget, it was impossible to do so!

All these years, every time he thought of that Tyrant Boar’s super big ass, he would scream hysterically, wanting to kill everyone in front of him. Most of all, he wanted to chop Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei into mincemeat!

That Tyrant Boar had already been skinned and deboned long ago!

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong mocked as his figure flickered into a blur, appearing beside Shi Xiaofei. With a punch, he sent the Zhang Family Elder flying.

That Zhang Family Elder had yet to realize what was going on, but he was already struck by Huang Xiaolong.
