Chapter 3619 – Are You Kidding Me?

“You… Are you joking?” Chen Hui gasped.

That was the first time in her life she ever heard of someone who wanted to purchase a batch of universe-level spiritual veins!

What concept was that?!

Who in the world had the ability to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins?!

The lady at the counter stared at Huang Xiaolong silently as she thought about the possibility of him being serious.

“Brat, do you know how serious the consequences are when you mess around in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce?” A sneer came from behind him all of a sudden.

Yang Rong and Chen Hui’s expressions changed when they saw who it was.

It was a direct disciple of the Cao Family!

The Cao Family was a super family in the Limitless Celestial Empire. They were second only to the royal family and the old ancestor of the Cao Family was the second strongest expert in the Limitless Land! There were rumors that his strength had crossed the 16 billion units mark!

Other than the old ancestor of the Cao Family, the Cao Family Patriarch was also one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land. He had 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy and he wasn’t weaker than the Limitless Celestial Emperor!

As for the God of Creation Realm experts in the Cao Family, there were probably more than a hundred of them!

There wasn’t much of a need to count those weaker than that.

That was the reason behind the Cao Family’s power. Not even the Limitless Celestial Empire would dare to mess with them! Especially after the Limitless Master was injured by the Dragon Overlord! In the recent years, the Cao Family has been building up their strength openly.

Even though the Chen Family was a top-tier family in the Limitless Land, they were nothing before the Cao Family. The old ancestor of the Chen Family might be at the peak of the grand completion stage in the God of Creation Realm, but the Cao Family merely needed a single thought if they wanted the Chen Family to disappear from the face of the universe!

The lady standing behind the counter was equally as shocked.

When the young man who sneered at Huang Xiaolong approached the counter, she recognized him instantly.

“Young Master Cao Ze, welcome!”

The young man nodded and chuckled, “I heard that you managed to obtain a top-grade fire dragon attributed universe-level spiritual vein.”

“That’s right. Young master is really knowledgeable! We only managed to obtain it yesterday and you’re already here! I’ll get our director out here immediately.”

There was no way ordinary disciples would be able to meet the director of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce. However, Cao Ze wasn’t an ordinary disciple of the Cao Family! He was the grandson of the Cao Family’s old patriarch, and he was also a God of Creation at the grand completion stage!

He was more talented than Wu Qifeng and Ye Jingyu, and his strength was also on another level compared to the two of them!

When the lady behind the counter left, he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, Chen Hui, and Yang Rong.

“Chen Family?” He muttered.

Yang Rong and Chen Hui bowed in haste and greeted, “We greet Lord Cao Ze!”

The two of them might not have seen Cao Ze in their lives, but they definitely heard of him! They knew that he was the greatest disciple in the third generation of the Cao Family. They also knew that he was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage.

Turning slightly, he looked at Huang Xiaolong and he mocked, “Did you say that you wanted to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins?”

“That’s right. I’ll be taking the one you mentioned earlier too.”

Cao Ze was stunned.

Yang Rong and Chen Hui felt their legs going numb when they heard what he said.

Cao Ze had already chosen a spiritual vein, but Huang Xiaolong went ahead and told the man he would be taking it for himself. Wasn’t he looking for trouble?!

Instead of flying into a rage, Cao Ze stared at Huang Xiaolong and mocked, “Interesting. This is the first time someone dares to fight me over someone I have my eyes on.”

“Don’t worry about it. Such is life.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

The blood drained from Yang Rong’s face.

The two ladies started to regret their decision. They planned to make friends with the unique character that was Huang Xiaolong, but he went ahead and enraged Cao Ze! If he flew into a rage, the two of them would be buried alongside Huang Xiaolong!

Cao Ze looked at Huang Xiaolong with a frown on his face. “Brat, do you know who I am?!”

He felt that the only reason Huang Xiaolong dared to act so haughty was because the kid had no idea who he was.

His reputation might be large, but not every bumpkin would know of him.

Laughter broke through the skies before Huang Xiaolong could say anything else. “Young Master Cao Ze, it’s our honor to welcome you!”

The director of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, Kong Lei, appeared in the main hall and a group of Gods of Creation followed closely behind him. There were more than a dozen of them who approached.

Kong Lei was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, but he was extremely passionate when welcoming Cao Ze.

Seeing Kong Lei, Cao Ze no longer bothered with Huang Xiaolong.

He would come to the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce every few years and he was pretty familiar with Kong Lei.

After a round of pleasantries, Kong Lei laughed slightly, “Before coming, I’ve already ordered someone to bring the spiritual vein over!”

One of the God of Creation Realm experts behind him brought over a spatial ring and he released the restrictions around it. Fire spiritual qi filled the hall as a fire dragon appeared behind the man. It was the top-grade universe-level spiritual vein Cao Ze had his eyes on.

“There’s no need to rush things.” Cao Ze sneered. Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, he continued, “This brat over here said that he wanted to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins. He wishes to buy this strand too.”

Kong Lei and the experts of the chamber of commerce were flabbergasted. They looked at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence. They noticed his presence when they approached, but they didn’t really care about anyone else other than Cao Ze.

With a mocking smile in his eyes, Cao Ze wanted to see what Huang Xiaolong could bring out. If he failed to bring out anything, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce would definitely punish him accordingly.

Kong Lei looked at the lady who was at the counter.

“Yes. This young master said that he wished to purchase a batch of universe-level spiritual veins when he entered the main hall. He even asked me for the total number we had on hand.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Kong Lei stared at Huang Xiaolong and said, “I wonder what you wish to use to trade with us.”

As the director of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, he could easily see that Cao Ze had some beef with the man. As such, he could teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson if the items he brought out weren’t satisfactory in an attempt to kiss up to Cao Ze.

Casually waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong released the restriction on one of his spatial rings. A blinding pillar of light emerged and blinded Cao Ze and the others for a second.
