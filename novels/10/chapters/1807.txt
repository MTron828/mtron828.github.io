Di Jun’s face sank, and his killing intent rose rapidly as he clenched his fists, but he immediately relaxed, and the air around him thawed.

“For the time being, I will let that brat live for a while longer.” Di Jun declared icily.

After all, Huang Xiaolong had the protection of both Jiang Hong and the King of Grandmist.

As long as the two of them stood behind Huang Xiaolong, everyone who wanted to move against him would think twice. Was it really worth it to anger two existences surpassing the Emperor Realm?

They hadn’t even considered the little cow traveling with Huang Xiaolong!

Di Jun felt a wave of terror wash over him when he thought about the little cow.

“Emperor Father, are we just supposed to watch Huang Xiaolong take away those two chaos lightning pools?” Di Jing asked unwillingly. There was a trace of hatred hidden in his grumbles.

Di Jun shook his head and a sinister sneer formed on his face. “Of course not.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Did Emperor Father do something to the lightning pools?” Di Jing’s eyes seemed to light up as he asked.

Di Jun smiled. “I used a mysterious art and released countless amounts of ancient Thunder Maggots from underneath the two chaos lightning pools. These maggots can blend into the thunder pools seamlessly and can avoid detection. When Huang Xiaolong absorbs the chaos lightning pool into his body, all the Thunder Maggots will enter his body without fail! HAHAHA!”

Thunder Maggots were considered one of the most poisonous insects in the ancient era. They had gained a reputation of being one of the six most toxic insects alive.

They would torture the person from the inside, and they would grow by sucking on Huang Xiaolong’s blood qi and godforce.

The moment they enter Huang Xiaolong’s body and integrate into his godhead and soul, even an existence surpassing the Emperor Realm wouldn’t be able to save him.

“Ancient Thunder Maggots!” Di Jing was impressed at his father’s meticulous planning! “Once the maggots enter Huang Xiaolong’s body, he won’t be able to expel it even if he enters the Emperor Realm! A mere Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch wouldn’t be able to do a thing! The only thing to worry about is Jiang Hong and that old fellow.”

Di Jun sneered and said, “How can they even prove that I was the one who released the maggots into the chaos lightning pool? Those maggots may have been in the pool since the beginning. Without proof, what can they possibly do to me?”

Di Jing nodded his head and said, “Now, I really can’t wait for Huang Xiaolong to absorb those two lightning pools!”

The two of them roared in laughter.

“Let’s go find a place to treat your injuries first, and after that, we have to locate the Heavenly Dao Stone for you to break through to the Emperor Realm.”

......

Huang Xiaolong hovered in the sky above the Heavenly Court’s chaos lightning pool as countless water droplets poured into the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows.

Three godheads appeared behind him, and his Archdevil bloodlines started to devour the power contained within the lightning pool. The speed at which Huang Xiaolong absorbed them was even faster than when he had absorbed the Black Tortoise Chaos Lightning Pool.

Huang Xiaolong’s entire body was surrounded by mysterious lightning.

Countless golden lightning dragons and mysterious lightning tortoises surrounded him.

Destructive lightning broke through to the sky and rumbled unceasingly.

Since the Heavenly Court’s Chaos Lightning Pool was contained in its own space, the outside world wouldn’t be able to learn of anything that happened there. Otherwise, destructive lightning would have alerted everyone in the outside world.

Huang Xiaolong’s strength rose at an astonishing speed as he refined and devoured the mysterious power of lightning. He eventually arrived at the peak of the early-Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm before breaking through to the mid-Seventh Order Heavenly Realm in one go!

After reaching the mid-Seventh Order Heavenly Realm, Huang Xiaolong’s speed didn’t slow down in the slightest. His cultivation level continued to soar at a rocket-like pace.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was completely immersed in devouring and refining the mysterious power of lightning, something thin and small made its way towards Huang Xiaolong.

Without a doubt, the tiny figure was an Ancient Thunder Maggot. They entered Huang Xiaolong’s body along with the surge of lightning, and Huang Xiaolong failed to notice a thing.

One year later.

The entire mysterious chaotic lightning pool started to fluctuate, and waves of lightning reaching the sky surged endlessly.

By this time, Huang Xiaolong had already reached the peak of the mid-Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

After another eight months...

Huang Xiaolong completely devoured the lightning pool.

All the lightning pools gathered around and flashed in the space between his eyebrows.

Huang Xiaolong slowly opened his eyes, and he let out a long breath full of lightning qi. It was like a volcanic eruption as a burst of energy flooded the space around him.

Previously, Huang Xiaolong had taken eight years to finish absorbing the Black Tortoise Chaos Lightning Pool, but now, he took less than a year!

Even after absorbing another chaos lightning pool, Huang Xiaolong had only managed to reach the late-Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Huang Xiaolong slowly calmed himself before flying towards the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool.

The lightning energy contained inside wasn’t as violent as the other three, and there was a trace of gentleness contained within.

However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised. According to the records, the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool was excellent in terms of its healing ability. Once he absorbed this Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool, he would instantly recover from multiple injuries. Even if he lost a limb, he would be able to utilize the healing properties of the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool to regenerate another one.

Huang Xiaolong sat above the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool and circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. Before long, the energy contained within the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool poured into his body.

Unknowingly, the Ancient Thunder Maggots had already entered his body along with the lightning energy.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was refining the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool, a burst of light suddenly erupted in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. The rune that sealed the entrance to the Devil World was blasted apart.

The devil army poured out from the black hole like a tide and flooded world surfaces one after another.
