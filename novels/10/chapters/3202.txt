Chapter 3203: Fu Luosen

“The Sixth Prince of the True Dragon Celestial Empire, Huang Rong, the Fourth Prince, Huang Ji, and the Second Prince, Huang Shengdao are all headed to the Dao Emperor World!” Zeng Ying replied.

Huang Rong!

When Huang Xiaolong heard that Huang Rong was on his way over, a trace of happiness flashed in his heart. However, it was replaced with a frown when he heard Huang Shengdao’s name.

The True Dragon Celestial Empire’s greatest and strongest genius was Huang Shengdao!

Many years ago, Huang Shengdao had already comprehended all thirteen elements, with twelve of them at perfection level!

As for the man’s true strength, no one was able to learn of it. There were rumors going around that he reached perfection level in the final element as the old ancestor of the True Dragon Celestial Empire had already named him as the Son of Creation!

“Yes… Huang Shengdao…” Zeng Ying stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression.

Huang Shengdao wasn’t just the number one expert in the True Dragon Celestial Empire, he was also the strongest genius in the young generation of the Blazing Dragon World! He ranked first among the geniuses in all three celestial empires, and no one even came close to challenging his position!

The reason behind the weird expression on Zeng Ying’s face was because she rejected his marriage proposal once before.

Ordinarily, she would be more than willing to marry a genius at his level! However, Zeng Ying couldn’t help but feel a sense of danger whenever he approached her.

Her heart was extremely uneasy every time she looked at him, and it was also the reason behind her refusal.

When Hao Yi and the others heard that Huang Shengdao was also headed over, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear rising in their hearts.

There was no one under the heavens who could remain emotionless when faced with the monster that was Huang Shengdao.

Zeng Ying reassured all of them when she saw the look of shock on their faces. “There’s no need to worry. The Dao Emperor World is large, and even if Huang Shengdao arrives, we might not run into him. Moreover, he’s there for the Dao Emperor’s Sword. We’re there for the Mysterious Magician’s treasury and we’re not going for the same thing! Moreover, there won’t be a need for us to fear him if we join hands.”

Zeng Ying released her aura completely, and Hao Yi and the others could only nod their heads reluctantly.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong learned that even the First Prince of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, Zeng Ying’s oldest brother, Zeng Tianchong was headed for the Dao Emperor World! He even brought along Xue Jian with him!

Di Xiaolong and other princes of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire were also rushing over as they spoke.

Other than Huang Shengdao, Zeng Tianchong, Xue Jiao, Di Xiaolong, and a few others, a ton of old freaks and patriarchs were headed for the Dao Emperor World. Freaks like the Extreme East Old Man also had their sights set on the Dao Emperor World.

Even You Ming, the Palace Master of the Nether Spirit Palace, was bringing the massive army he commanded over towards them.

Unless one was already a God of Creation, there was no way they wouldn’t be tempted by the Dao Emperor’s Sword.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong and the others left and returned to their manors.

“Your Highness, who would have thought that the Main Pavilion Master of the Mystical Pavilion, Huang Rong, would also come?” Li Shuo gasped in shock.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly.

Back in the Huang Long World, Huang Rong managed to escape by the skin of his teeth. It had been seven hundred thousand years since Huang Xiaolong last met the man, and he wondered how far Huang Rong progressed. In the past, Huang Rong had already comprehended twelve elements with seven of them being at perfection level. He had to have improved… right?

Yuan Tianyi growled in anger, “When we run into the Extreme East Old Man in the future, hand him over to me!” Anger burned in his eyes as the desire to battle raged in his heart.

In the past, the Extreme East Old Man injured him during their last battle. He couldn’t forget the shame no matter how hard he tried.

A hundred years passed, and the Nine Phoenix Flying Ship arrived before the Dao Emperor World.

If the Blazing Dragon World was a world that was like a sun that lit up the universe with its aggressive light, the Dao Emperor World was a world that emitted a faint and calming glow as sword qi swirled around the air.

Right before they could enter, another massive flying ship started to fly towards them, and the insignia of a giant hammer could be seen on the flying ship.

Zeng Ying’s expression turned serious when she looked at the flying ship. “It’s the members of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire!”

The Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire was created by the God of Creation, Fu Li, and they were a force to be reckoned with.

There were more than thirty great worlds in the universe, and the Blazing Dragon World was ranked on top! The Excessive Darkness World was ranked second, but the strength of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire was something even the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire had to be wary of.

When the flying ship of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire flew past them, it slowed for a second, but they didn’t stop. In a flash, the flying ship entered the Dao Emperor World.

Huang Xiaolong could see that when the ship slowed down previously, there were many eyes on them. It was clear that the other party was evaluating their strength.

The dao soul that tried to estimate their strength was extremely strong, and Huang Xiaolong knew that none of his dao souls would be a match for it individually.

“Who would have thought that the experts of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire would arrive too…” Xu Fu gasped in shock. “I wonder which prince from the celestial empire came… If it’s the Fourth Prince, we’ll be in trouble!”

The Fourth Prince of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire was also one of the strongest geniuses under the heavens.

In the universe, there were five great Sons of Heaven. They were hailed as the strongest geniuses in the younger generation of the universe, and Huang Shengdao was one of them! The Fourth Prince of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire, Fu Luosen was also ranked among them.

Those could could be named alongside Huang Shengdao could only be absolute geniuses, and one could only imagine how strong Fu Luosen was.

“Let’s enter.” Zeng Ying’s voice turned serious. “When we enter, let’s not clash with the experts of the other factions.”

Soon after, the Nine Phoenix Flying Ship entered the Dao Emperor World.

At the same time, there were several dozen experts seated in the main hall of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire’s flying ship. Fu Luosen was precisely the person sitting there, and he was someone who exuded an aura of majesty. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Fourth Highness, that should be Princess Zeng Ying’s Nine Phoenix Flying Ship.” Someone reported.

A smile formed on Fu Luosen’s face, and he chuckled, “She’s pretty good…”

A sense of interest could be heard in his voice, and a marshal of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire quickly followed up, “I tried probing them previously, and the youngster beside her is a true expert.”

The person who scanned Huang Xiaolong and the others was precisely the marshal who just spoke, and he was called Chen Tingwei. Among the marshals of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire, his strength ranked in the top three. He was comparable to Xue Jian of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire.

Of course, the youngster he was talking about was Huang Xiaolong.

Fu Luosen dismissed it quickly. “It’s just an ant. He hasn’t reached perfection level in all thirteen elements.” However, an amused expression soon appeared on his face. “I’ve heard that Huang Shengdao will be coming too. I wonder how strong he has grown after all these years.”

It had been a million years since the two last came to blows.

“Your Highness, you should be the strongest individual in the younger generation of the universe. Huang Shengdao is a little lacking compared to you!” Another marshal roared with laughter in response.

Fu Luosen chuckled, and he didn’t deny what he said. Soon after, his tone changed, “We are definitely going to obtain the Dao Emperor’s Sword this time. We’ll kill everyone who gets in my way!”
