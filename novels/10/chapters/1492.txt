Yao Chi was lost in thought as she looked towards the Fortune Divine Kingdom in the distance.

“This time, Xiaolong has entered seclusion attempting to break through to the God King Realm, so he won’t come out so soon.” Li Lu said from beside Yao Chi. “Look at Second Master, how many years has he been stuck at the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, unable to break through to God King Realm.”

Li Lu was naturally referring to Blood Knife Ancestor as the Second Master.

Yao Chi pouted sulkily but nodded and said, “Yes I am aware of that.”

Blood Knife Ancestor has been cultivating for hundreds of millennia but he still hasn’t broken through to the God King Realm. In comparison, how long has Huang Xiaolong been cultivating so far? As amazing as Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed is, it would probably take a hundred years at least, wouldn’t it? It might even take two to three hundred years for him to break through to the God King Realm.

Yao Chi’s mood fell further as she was busy thinking that Huang Xiaolong might not come out for another two to three hundred years.

“We should support Xiaolong, and understand him.” said Li Lu as she took a step closer to Yao Chi and held her hand comfortingly.

Yao Chi nodded, “Sister Li Lu, do you think we are a burden for Xiaolong?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Li Lu stiffened, then sighed. But determination crept up her eyes and she said firmly, “All the more reason for us to cultivate harder, improve ourselves, and improve our strengths so that we don’t become Xiaolong’s burden.”

Both of them had come to know about Huang Xiaolong’s king of supreme godhead only after arriving at the Fortune Emperor Palace. At the same time, they had also become aware of Huang Xiaolong’s status in the Fortune Emperor Palace.

“Sisters, what are you two talking about?” A clear crisp voice broke the heavy atmosphere around Yao Chi and Li Lu.

Yao Chi and Li Lu turned to look, and saw Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan entering the courtyard.

“Elder Sister Peng Xiao, Elder Sister Xuanxuan, you’re here.” Li Lu and Yao Chi both stood up, happily welcoming them.

In the last decade, Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan had been frequent visitors at Yao Chi and Li Lu’s courtyard. As Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan had straightforward personalities, and didn’t put on any air of superiority, the four women got along harmoniously like sisters.

Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan came over and each took a seat.

“We were just talking about Xiaolong’s seclusion and guessing when he would be able to come out.” Yao Chi smiled and explained.

Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan exchanged a look and giggled softly. Fang Xuanxuan deliberately looked at Yao Chi from top to bottom with roving eyes.

Seeing Fang Xuanxuan’s action, Yao Chi checked herself and found nothing wrong, thus she asked, “Elder Sister Xuanxuan, why are you looking at me like that?”

“I’m trying to see which part of you is missing Huang Xiaolong? The upper part or the lower? I think the lower part misses him the most.” Fang Xuanxuan chuckled.

Peng Xiao laughed and agreed readily, “I think so too.”

Yao Chi was stupefied. Her face immediately turned red when she realized what Fang Xuanxuan meant, and protested angrily, “Elder Sister Peng Xiao, Elder Sister Xuanxuan, you two only know how to bully me.” Then she jumped up vengefully from her seat and declared, “I’m going to tickle you two silly ladies.”

Girlish shrieks and laughter filled the courtyard as Yao Chi targeted Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan’s most ticklish areas.

At first, Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao ran and dodged, but it quickly turned into a counterattack against Yao Chi.

Two against one, Yao Chi naturally fell at a disadvantage.

"Younger Sister Li Lu come help me quickly." Yao Chi cried out to Li Lu who was spectating them from the side.

Li Lu hesitated only briefly before joining the fray.

In an instant, there was a live enactment of beauties frolicking in the garden. If someone chanced into this sight, a nose bleed was inevitable. Whether it was Yao Chi’s charm, Li Lu’s cold elegance, Fang Xuanxuan’s loveliness, or Peng Xiao’s noble bearing. Each one of them were a rare beauty in the Divine World.

These beauties with different temperaments were now gathered together.

As the four ’attacked’ each other, their attires began to loosen, revealing their snow white skin that was colored with a hint of healthy flush.

As Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan had been visiting Yao Chi and Li Lu over the years, their familiarity and closeness had increased, and they would joke and play like this occasionally.

Not to mention, as there were no outsiders around, the four would play freely to their heart’s content.

Meanwhile, a radiant light suddenly glimmered from Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation palace within the Fortune Divine Kingdom, and a figure flickered, flying out from the light. This was naturally Huang Xiaolong who had been in seclusion for more than a decade now.

Standing high in the air, Huang Xiaolong’s momentum caused the clouds above him to roil. Huang Xiaolong’s current momentum was much stronger compared to the time he had battled with Wang Yongsen during the apprenticeship ceremony.

However, Huang Xiaolong was shaking his head and didn’t seem to be in a good mood.

Though his strength had risen considerably, his cultivation had only advanced to the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, and he had been unable to break through that barrier to the God King Realm.

More accurately, he had advanced to the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm four years ago. Since then, no matter how hard he had cultivated, or how many chaos spiritual pills, chaos spiritual herbs, or Fortune Divine Fruits he had consumed, he was unable to break through to the God King Realm.

The barrier to God King Realm was like a thin veil hindering his view. He could already see a vague treasure mountain right in front of him, however, he was unable to pull away that thin veil.

There was something missing somehow.

Huang Xiaolong frowned as he pondered. “Looks like I still have to go out to try my luck.”

He felt it was futile to continue cultivating in seclusion. Even if another twenty years were to pass, he still wouldn’t be able to break through to God King Realm.

Therefore, he decided to exit seclusion and go outside to try his luck.

If he could find a source of grandmist aura in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield and refine it, his Grandmist Parasitic Medium could definitely advance to the third stage, thus helping him to break through to the God King Realm!

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong flew out from the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

Huang Xiaolong had been in seclusion for more than a decade, so he inevitably wondered how Yao Chi and Li Lu were doing. Of course, there were his Masters, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, Xiaoniu, Xiang Xun and the rest as well.

Exiting the Fortune Divine Kingdom, he flew straight towards the Tiger Dragon Palace Gardens. Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others were staying at the cultivation palace next to his at the Tiger Dragon Palace gardens.

Shortly, Huang Xiaolong arrived at his destination, but before entering Yao Chi and Li Lu’s courtyard, he could hear the jovial atmosphere, inside. He was baffled. What’s going on? Are there other female guests?

Carrying his doubts, Huang Xiaolong stepped into the noisy courtyard. However, one step into the courtyard, the sight that welcomed him rendered him agape.

Yao Chi, Li Lu, Peng Xiao, and Fang Xuanxuan’s attires were disheveled, revealing some parts of their bodies that were not supposed to be exposed. Huang Xiaolong’s gaze was attracted by the snow white decolletages, and one conclusion reverberated in his mind, ‘So big, one bigger than the other!’

Though he could not see the peach blossom mark, half a bosom was enough to drive anyone’s imagination.

The four women’s actions halted as they sensed that someone had walked into the courtyard. They raised their eyes, and when they saw Huang Xiaolong, each woman had a different expression on her face.

Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan were the first to scream, not knowing which part of their bodies to cover. In a gust of wind, both of them disappeared from the courtyard, only they knew what secret method they had used to do that. Li Lu flushed in embarrassment and she too disappeared in a blur, a split second later.

In the end, only Yao Chi was left behind. After all, Yao Chi had had an intimate relationship with Huang Xiaolong, so her reaction was less dramatic than the other three women. She merely tidied her attire in a fluster and walked towards Huang Xiaolong with a red face, “You, you, how come you’re out?”

“Erm, that, just now...?” Huang Xiaolong was at a loss for words.
