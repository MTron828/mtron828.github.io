Guo Shi’s gaze swept around, and fell on Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Li Zhi, Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s Wang Yu, and the number of crippled and injured Guo Family’s guards lying on the streets. A frown wrinkled his brows. Huang Xiaolong’s battle power was far stronger than he had expected!

Before this, the Guo Family had assumed that given his startling amount of strength, Huang Xiaolong could probably defeat some mid-Ninth or late-Ninth Order Ancient God Realm disciples at the most, even if he had broken through to peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm.

After all, a cultivator of peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm who had the strength to defeat a late-Ninth Order Ancient God Realm had never appeared in the Vientiane World before!

But now, an early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm patrol group leader was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong!

One punch!

Then, what is Huang Xiaolong’s current battle power?!

Thinking of this, Guo Shi’s face darkened further as his killing intent towards Huang Xiaolong roiled inwardly.

Huang Xiaolong cannot be allowed to grow his strength anymore!

They must kill him!

During the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, no matter what, he would need to emphasize to his son Guo Jun to take care of Huang Xiaolong once and for all.

Golden Brow’s wrath would need to take a back seat compared to killing Huang Xiaolong during the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony.

“Return.” Guo Shi said to the several Guo Family’s Grand Elders. In a flicker, he disappeared from the spot. When Guo Shi appeared again, he and the several Grand Elders were already back at Guo Family’s headquarters main hall.

One of the Guo Family’s Grand Elder who was carrying Guo Gang, ordered a guard to take Guo Gang to heal in the spiritual pond.

It didn’t take long for the all of Guo Family’s Grand Elders to appear at the main hall.

Lastly, a young man with extraordinary bearing walked into the main hall; he had thick brows, was slightly over six feet tall, and his skin was like white jade that made others stare at him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Father.” The young man stood in front of Guo Shi and saluted respectfully. This young man was none other than the Guo Family’s number one genius, Guo Jun.

Guo Shi’s gloomy expression eased slightly; a faint smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he said, “You’re here, take a seat.”

Guo Jun took one of the seats at the side of the main hall.

The hall grew quiet as Guo Shi looked at everyone in the main hall.

“I’m sure that everyone knows what happened earlier.” Guo Shi began solemnly, “What do you all think of this matter?”

Suddenly, someone jumped in anger and clamored, “Big brother, we absolutely must kill Huang Xiaolong this time! In Sea God City, a mere Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s disciple had the guts to injure Guo Family’s disciple in public. This is not just insulting for the Guo Family, but the entire sea tribe!”

This person was Guo Jin, Guo Gang’s father who had rushed over from the Golden Wheel City for the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony.

He would have never imagined that Huang Xiaolong could heavily injure his son to such an extent that he might not able to heal fully.

Guo Shi nodded as he turned to his son Guo Jun and said, “Jun’er, during the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, when you challenge Huang Xiaolong to a battle, use all your strength. You do not need to feel any burden, just kill him.”

“Yes, Father, and Second Uncle, please rest assured.” Guo Jun stood up and respectfully acknowledged.

......

At the same time, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor had brought Huang Xiaolong back to the rundown courtyard.

Golden Brow Ancestor’s brows were scrunched together.

On the other hand, Blood Knife Ancestor was smiling as he said, “Say, Little Long Long, I didn’t think that you actually hid it from us, even an early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm sea tribe’s disciple is not your match!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly, if he remembered correctly, he had not deliberately hidden it from them. Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor had assumed on their own that he merely had the battle strength of a late-Ninth Order Ancient God Realm cultivator.

“Alright now, Senior Brother Golden Brow, it’s nothing even if Xiaolong injured Guo Gang. I don’t believe that the Guo Family would dare to do anything about it.” Blood Knife said and added noticing Golden Brow Ancestor’s expression, “We should be happy that Xiaolong has such an ability.”

Golden Brow Ancestor shook his head, and replied with a question, “What if the Guo Family really dares to do something and hurt Xiaolong?”

Blood Knife Ancestor choked with silence, unable to answer Golden Brow Ancestor.

Golden Brow Ancestor said to Huang Xiaolong with a hint of worry in his tone, “Xiaolong, I’m afraid that Guo Jun will target you. When that happens on the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony’s battle stage, even I will not be able to interfere in the competition.”

In the end, Golden Brow Ancestor was still worried that Huang Xiaolong was not a match against Guo Jun and Feng Yingying.

Huang Xiaolong said solemnly, “Master, don’t worry, it won’t be easy for Guo Jun to defeat me.”

Golden Brow Ancestor frowned, and tried to persuade Huang Xiaolong, “Guo Jun is not as simple as you think. He is at least a mid-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, but his battle strength has already reached a late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm. Presently, your cultivation is only at peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, therefore you are no match for Guo Jun!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled all of a sudden, but he did not argue, and merely said, “Then, Master, what are your thoughts?”

Golden Brow Ancestor pondered for a moment, then said, “I’ll send you back to the Fortune Gate.”

Both Huang Xiaolong and Blood Knife Ancestor were stunned by his words.

"Back to Fortune Gate?" Huang Xiaolong shook his head, and refused, "Master, I know you’re thinking in my best interest, but if you want me to avoid Guo Jin and Feng Yingying, it is impossible. If this matter were to spread outside, how would the Wangu Clan, and Dark Elf Tribe look at our Fortune Gate? Not to mention, how would forces from other world surfaces look at our Fortune Gate?"

More importantly, how would Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s disciples look at Huang Xiaolong?

All of the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s disciples would think he’s a wimp, who is hiding like a turtle inside the shell!

“That’s right, Senior Brother Golden Brow, moreover, even if Xiaolong manages to avoid facing them this time around, there will always be a next time, when they will try to deal with and hurt Xiaolong.” Blood Knife Ancestor went on, “Not to mention, avoiding things this way is not beneficial to Xiaolong’s cultivation state in the future, and it would be hard to eliminate, even after he breaks through to Ancestor God Realm.”

Golden Brow Ancestor sighed, "I understand your point of view." He looked at Huang Xiaolong and Blood Knife Ancestor and nodded. He went on, "Alright, Xiaolong, Master respects your decision. Rest assured, Master will always stand behind you. If Guo Jun tries to kill you..." His eyes turned frosty as he continues, "...Even if Master has to leave the Fortune Gate, I will wreck havoc for the sea tribe and the Guo Family."

At the same time, inside one of the courtyards within the residence, Zhu Feng, Zhu Yi, and Wang Wei were sitting in a room discussing Huang Xiaolong’s conflict with the Golden Phoenix Pavilion, Black Region World’s Fortune Gate, and Guo Family.

"Father, Huang Xiaolong injured the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s number one genius disciple Li Zhi, and the Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s Wang Yu. Worst of all, he also injured the Guo Family’s Guo Gang. Due to this, he has provoked so many enemies against Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate, and has put us in a predicament. We have to punish him!" Zhu Feng went on, "I suggest Huang Xiaolong to be expelled from our Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate as well as his cultivation to be abolished. Then we also need to announce that we have severed all relations with him!"

Zhu Yi glanced at his son, then looked at Wang Wei, "Wang Wei, as the Fortune Gate’s chief disciple, what is your opinion?"

Wang Wei calmly and respectfully answered, "In my opinion, we should not punish Huang Xiaolong because of this."

Zhu Feng was stunned.

He knew that Wang Wei hated Huang Xiaolong as much as he did, and Wang Wei would never miss a chance to kick Huang Xiaolong out of the Fortune Gate like a flea, but now he was actually defending Huang Xiaolong?

Zhu Yi was surprised as well, but he remained calm on the surface as he asked, “Why so?”

“Golden Phoenix Pavilion and Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s disciples provoked Huang Xiaolong, therefore Huang Xiaolong was merely defending himself. As for Guo Gang, he wanted to capture Huang Xiaolong without investigating the cause and reason behind the scuffle, as he holds a grudge against Huang Xiaolong, and wanted to take his revenge. Thus,the fault lies with the sea tribe and not Huang Xiaolong.”

Wang Wei then asked, “What crime has Huang Xiaolong committed?”
