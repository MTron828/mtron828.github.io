Chapter 2935: Finally Succeeding

Very soon, the Mystical Pavilion’s branch in the Dragon Fish Creed was tightly surrounded by experts from all around. Even Zhang Wen, Chen Shaoen, Shi Chuan, and the other expats who were ordered by Zeng Lei to guard the area felt their expressions changing.

Even a high-level Dao Venerable would feel numb when faced with so many experts.

Zhang Wen took a deep breath and greeted Li Xue respectfully, “Lord Li Xue, what’s the meaning of this?” Even though he was an Eminent Elder in the Mystical Pavilion’s branch, he would have to refer to the grand hall master of the Dragon Fish Creed respectfully.

That was the prestige possessed by a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable!

Even if Zeng Lei was present, he would have to be respectful to her!

“Call Zeng Lei out right now.” Li Xue’s face was cold as she went straight to the point, “Hand over Huang Xiaolong!”

Zhang Wenqiang squeezed out a smile, “Lord Li Xue, Huang Xiaolong already left a long time ago! I have no idea where he went!”

It was true that he was unaware of Huang Xiaolong’s whereabouts. Or rather, he had no idea where Zeng Lei had taken him.

Li Xue sneered, “Humph. According to my sources, he’s still here.”

Zhang Wen smiled, “Lord Li Xue, you shouldn’t trust others too easily. Huang Xiaolong is no longer here. If you don’t believe me, you can look for him yourself.”

Speaking up to this point, he looked at the experts behind Li Xue, “However, only Lord Li Xue can enter!”

The experts behind Li Xue frowned.

“Alright!” Li Xue paused slightly before signaling for them to back down.

Even though the Mystical Pavilion looked like it spanned tens of thousands of miles long, there were countless overlapping spaces inside. No one knew how large it actually was.

Even a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert like Li Xue would need some time to search the entire area.

However, after an hour, Li Xue’s face turned unsightly. She looked through as many spaces as she could, but she failed to find traces of Huang Xiaolong or even Zeng Lei!

After leaving the branch pavilion, Li Xue reported what happened to Bi Cheng. It didn’t take long for her to return.

Those who had come hoping to catch a good battle were disappointed.

“It looks like Huang Xiaolong managed to escape!” Xuanyuan Potian sneered, “He can escape once, but he can’t escape forever! He will never be able to leave the Divine Tuo Holy World!”

Hu Renqing smiled, “That’s right. Even if Li Xue fails to find him, the Dragon Fish Creed will definitely pass down the order to hunt him down! He won’t be able to hide in the Divine Tuo Holy World!”

With the various creeds working together, no one would dare to protect Huang Xiaolong!

Not even the super races born during the creation of the world would dare to!

Subsequently, Xuanyuan Potian and the rest of the people left.

Not too long after, the ten great creeds passed down Huang Shuai’s order to capture Huang Xiaolong. The bounty was a shocking ten billion Tuoshen dao coins!

Ten billion Tuoshen dao coins!

When the news was released, the entire world went into a frenzy.

Of course, there was a condition. Huang Xiaolong had to be captured alive.

Huang Shuai also announced that if Huang Xiaolong was willing to surrender to him before the ceremony, he would pardon Huang Xiaolong of all crimes!

He made it clear that if Huang Xiaolong were to miss the deadline, he would be dead no matter what.

When the experts in the Divine Tuo Holy World went looking for Huang Xiaolong, he was carefully refining a furnace full of genesis-level pills in a certain space within the Mystical Pavilion.

The herbs turned into strands of medicinal liquid that emitted enchanting medicinal qi. Ordinary Primal Ancestors would be able to benefit a whole lot if they caught a whiff of it!

Zeng Lei stood at the side, and he sneered in his heart. Enjoy it while you can. Once the pills are refined, you’ll have to return everything you took from me!

“Eleven high-order Saint Fates, three grand dao souls, and a mysterious bloodline. If he could turn Huang Xiaolong into a pill, the effects would definitely be no weaker than a genesis level pill! In fact, the effects might even exceed genesis level pills! Zeng Lei thought to himself as his eyes flickered.

He decided to wait till Huang Xiaolong had finished refining the pills before capturing him. He would throw Huang Xiaolong into the pill furnace he had finished refining the pills from and refine him into a pill!

He had a pill recipe that could refine humans in order to refine a supreme pill! Of course, the person in question needed at least nine high-order Saint Fates and two grand dao souls!

Huang Xiaolong completely fulfilled the criteria.

The higher his talent was, the better the pills would be!

Several months later.

With Huang Xiaolong’s constant tempering, the medicinal liquid fused with each other, and pill fragrance filled the skies. Rays of colorful light emerged from the Sun Moon Furnace.

That was the sign that the pill was about to be refined successfully! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zeng Lei’s heart tightened.

As time passed, the Sun Moon Furnace shook more vigorously. A slight trembling came from the space around them and pillars of light emerged from the mouth of the furnace. A pill shot out from within the furnace.

As soon as it appeared, the entire space went dark. Lightning clouds gathered in the skies above and bolts fell on the pill. The power of the lightning caused Zeng Lei’s expression to change.

A lightning tribulation would appear when grand dao pills were successfully crafted. When a genesis pill was made, it went without saying that the tribulation would be much stronger!

Zeng Lei was prepared as he waved his hand casually to resist the tribulation.

For the sake of refining the pill, he had spent a lot of effort in making the array. He had used countless grand dao materials and an extremely high-tier spiritual stone to power the array.

As soon as he activated it, the lightning was blocked off.

Pill formation!

A blast rang through the skies as a ringing sound buzzed in the ears of everyone present.

The Divine Tuo Holy World was filled with the clear ringing sound.

“That… That’s the sign that a genesis level pill has been successfully created!” Huang Shuai’s eyes turned red as he yelled, “Who refined the pill?! Send everyone out to search for the person who successfully refined the pill!”

If he managed to obtain the pill, he would definitely be able to reach the Second Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

Zeng Lei roared with laughter in the mysterious space. “Finally! It’s done!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the excited Zeng Lei and said calmly, “Branch Master Zeng Lei, you can hand over the remaining stands of beginning qi.”
