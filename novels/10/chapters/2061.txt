Chapter 2062: Fiend Shrine

Chen Tingfei could hardly be blamed for thinking that Huang Xiaolong might not pass through all of Ksana Divine Temple’s thirty restrictions. After all, no one had ever succeeded.

Another half a year went by.

Seeing that there wasn’t any movement from the Ksana Divine Temple after watching it for so long, Chen Tingfei said to the divine temple’s Ancestors, “Continue to keep watch here and pay attention to the movements coming from inside the Ksana Divine Temple. I am returning to the Ksana Divine Sect headquarters temporarily.”

Just as Chen Tingfei turned to leave, coruscating fiery lights burst out from the Ksana Divine Temple, along with vigorous, endless divine flames, that were akin to a sudden geyser, erupting from the ground of a dying spring.

“This is!” Chen Tingfei’s footsteps halted abruptly. He was just as startled as the rest of Ksana Divine Sect’s experts.

The King of Darkness who had been guarding outside the Ksana Divine Temple opened his eyes the instant there were movements from the Ksana Divine Temple. In the depths of his eyes was surprise, as well as joy.

Such a phenomenon from the Ksana Divine Temple, does that mean...?

That’s right, an instant ago, Huang Xiaolong had successfully comprehended the thirtieth restriction, the last of the Ksana Divine Temple’s restrictions, reaching the deepest chamber of Ksana Divine Temple.

On the outside, Chen Tingfei, the King of Darkness, and the rest saw a pillar of flames rise to the sky from the center of Ksana Divine Temple, and a figure was slowly rising upwards in the middle of the pillar of flames.

“Huang Xiaolong—!”

Chen Tingfei and the Ksana Divine Sect’s experts exclaimed.

That figure was none other than Huang Xiaolong, who had successfully passed through all thirty of the Ksana Divine Temple’s restrictions.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s body was almost transparent like glass with various kinds and colors of divine fires flowing through his body like veins. With each inhale and exhale, the whole Fire World’s fire element qi, the Ksana Divine Temple, in fact, the whole Fire World seemed to rise and fall with his actions.

The fire element qi was resembling the rising sea tide, splashing higher.

“Greetings to the World Lord!” Chen Tingfei swiftly stepped forward and kneeled respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong in salute. At this point, even a blind person would guess that Huang Xiaolong had successfully passed the Ksana Divine Temple’s thirty restrictions.

Seeing that Chen Tingfei had stepped forward and knelt in salute, the present Ksana Divine Temple’s experts recovered their senses and hastened to follow suit in saluting Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s arm of flowing divine flames raised, Chen Tingfei and the Ksana Divine Temple’s experts were lifted off their knees involuntarily. “Rise.”

“Thank you, World Lord!”

In the meantime, the King of Darkness approached from another side, laughing as he said to Huang Xiaolong, “I really have to believe Azure Cow’s words now.”

Earlier, the little cow had said any miracles in the world were not considered as miracles in front of Huang Xiaolong. Initially, the King of Darkness had remained doubtful. But now, he was a true believer.

Passing the Ksana Divine Temple’s thirty restrictions in less than seven years... If this news spreads out, it absolutely would shock the world.

Huang Xiaolong grinned to the King of Darkness in response, “Next month, we will set off to the Fiend World.”

The King of Darkness was baffled for a second, but then he understood what Huang Xiaolong intended. He shook his head and smiled wryly.

"How is the current situation in Hell and Demon World?" Huang Xiaolong asked the King of Darkness.

Huang Xiaolong had been inside the Ksana Divine Temple for almost seven years. Thus he had no idea what the situations were in Hell and the Demon World.

"Everything is progressing smoothly." The King of Darkness answered. "Azure Cow and Dean Reverence Moon joined hands and completely crushed Hell’s ancient clans’ alliance. Other than Ghost World’s Scorpio Clan’s Old Ancestor, who managed to run away, the rest were killed. Things are just as smooth in the Demon World without the Old Crow Ancestor causing trouble. Azure Cow, that old woman holds the Demon World in her iron hands and successfully sits on the throne of Demon World’s Lord!"

The King of Darkness went on a little sourly, "Azure Cow, that old woman is so powerful now, deterring the four directions with a great army of demon soldiers at her command."

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, hearing that. He could imagine the little cow’s smug face at becoming the Demon World Lord and commanding the Demon World’s army.

He then asked, "What about the Divine World? What’s the current situation?"

The King Of Darkness paused momentarily before answering, " The situation in the Divine World is not so favorable. Although the majority of Emperor Palaces have submitted to the Grandmist Emperor Palace due to Dean Reverence Moon and King of Grandmist’s deterrence, supporting Jiang Hong as the new owner of the Heavenly Court, a number of Emperor Palaces are resisting."

“Backing these resisting Emperor Palaces are the ancient clans. More accurately, their backings are those several old monsters. Those several old monsters have joined together, so things are a little tricky.”

Clearly, in the Divine World, the King of Grandmist had the most resounding prestige. However, in the Divine World, the King of Grandmist was not the only overlord. There were a few old monsters of the same generation as the King of Grandmist.

Even though these several old monsters’ strength was incomparable to the King of Grandmist, each of their strength paralleled to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming. Once these old monsters joined hands, it was harder to defeat them. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“However, you don’t need to worry about it, Azure Cow that old woman is organizing the Demon World’s forces. Once she and Du Hai have settled the affairs over there, they would converge with Dean Reverence Moon, King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the rest. Their powers are sufficient to crush those several old monsters’s alliance.” Afraid Huang Xiaolong would worry about the situation in the Divine World, the King of Darkness supplemented.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. In truth, he wasn’t worried at all. As long as the City of All-Heavens did not interfere, unifying the Divine World was already a certainty.

In the subsequent one month, with his newly acquired identity as the Fire World Lord, Huang Xiaolong convened all the Fire World’s superpowers. When these Fire World’s superpowers learned Huang Xiaolong had passed the Ksana Divine Temple’s assessment. With the Ksana Divine Sect supporting Huang Xiaolong, the other superpowers did not object. All of them knelt on their knees, saluting Huang Xiaolong as a sign of submission.

The Fiend World was quite close to the Fire World. Hence, with the Ancient Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Fiend World in less than a day.

A month later, Huang Xiaolong left the Fire World. Together with the King of Darkness, he set off to the Fiend World.

The Fiend World was completely the opposite of Fire World. In the Fire World, there was sunlight, warmth, and everywhere was fire element qi. Whereas, the Fiend World was chilling and sinister with roiling fiend qi.

Upon arriving in the Fiend World, Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness rushed towards the Fiend World’s Fiend Shrine without stopping.

The Fiend Shrine was not located in the Fiend World’s center region, but on the coldest and most extreme yin world surface.

I wonder what realm could my cultivation advance to after getting the Fiend World’s inheritance...? On the way, Huang Xiaolong thought inwardly.

At the time, Huang Xiaolong had successfully passed the Ksana Divine Temple’s thirtieth restriction, and absorbed the Fire World’s origin energy inside the last restriction space, he had managed to advance to late-Eighth Order Emperor Realm.

However, if he could get the Fiend World’s inheritance, he could break through to the Ninth Order Emperor Realm.

“Who dares to trespass into the Fiend World’s forbidden land!?”

When Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness reached the Fiend Shrine’s world surface, they immediately came face to face with their first obstruction. The Ksana Divine Sect guarded the Ksana Divine Temple’s inheritance. Similarly, the Fiend Shrine’s inheritance, too, had its own guardians. It was one of the oldest fiend race clans.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t trouble these disciples guarding the Fiend Shrine. He merely forced his way inside with aggressive force.

A few minutes later, Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness stood in front of the Fiend Shrine.

The shrine was not located on top of a peak but was floating above a stretch of black-colored water.

“You need to be careful. That is the Fiend World’s God Submerging Fiend Water. It can even melt a Sovereign’s soul if fallen inside.” The King of Darkness reminded Huang Xiaolong.
