Chapter 3451: Dragon Cave Space

Circulating three different types of creation-level arts, grand cosmos energy poured out of his body.

Boom!

Gu Yuan and Long Yu felt the world trembling around them. In the next moment, the entire area was isolated from the Dragon Cave.

3.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy came pouring out of Huang Xiaolong’s body, and it crushed everything in its way. Everything felt a sense of grand oppression and the two of them were forced to their knees.

3.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy were just too damn terrifying. The Dragon Cave was forced to the brink of destruction.

The dragonian beasts in the cave were forced to the ground and they growled in fright.

“3… 3.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy?!” Long Yu and Gu Yuan screamed in unison.

The two of them had already been seriously injured by Huang Xiaolong, and with the additional pressure coming from the void, they felt as though their bodies were going to explode!

Huang Xiaolong clasped his hand behind his back and walked towards both of them. Their bones started creaking heavily.

The more he walked, the paler they became.

Finally, they felt as though their dao souls were about to scatter.

“Lord… Please show mercy! We… We lost!”

They might be supreme experts in the Shi Li World, but they were like flies before Huang Xiaolong. It wasn’t embarrassing for them to admit defeat to someone so much stronger than them.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved his grand cosmos energy and smiled.

Half an hour later…

Gu Yuan and Long Yi stood obediently before Huang Xiaolong as they replied to all his questions respectfully. The two of them submitted to Huang Xiaolong, and he spent the past half an hour healing their wounds. They were back to their peak state after Huang Xiaolong’s assistance.

“How do you know about the Golden Dragon of Creation?” Huang Xiaolong asked. He realized that the two of them recognized the golden dragon the moment he summoned it! Could someone in their universe also have the Huang Long Bloodline?Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Yes.” The two of them looked at each other and raised an eyebrow in surprise. Could Huang Xiaolong not know about the existence of Huang Muyang?

“Your Highness, the God of Creation, Huang Muyang, of the Mu Yang World, has the Huang Long Bloodline.” Gu Yuan replied even though he was confused by Huang Xiaolong’s question.

Long Yi continued, “Huang Muyang can be said to be my junior. He might have been born after me, but his talent was much better. He was much luckier too, which explains his speed of cultivation. He entered the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm not too long ago.”

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

“However, Huang Muyang isn’t some sort of good person…” Gu Yuan shook his head and sighed. “He formed an alliance with the old b*stard Meng Tian and has been strutting about ever since.”

Anyone could feel the hatred Gu Yuan had for Huang Muyang.

“Meng Tian?” Huang Xiaolong asked again.

“Your Highness, do you not know about Meng Tian?” The two of them frowned in response.

“I came here from another universe.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t see the need to hide it from them.

“What?!” they yelled in fright.

“Other than the Meng Tian Universe, are there other universes out there?” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head before telling them about how Xuan Hai brought him over to the Meng Tian Universe.

Gu Yuan stared at Long Yi and the two of them saw the look of amazement in each other’s eyes.

Huang Xiaolong frowned. The two of them didn’t seem to know about the existence of other universes.

Soon after, he asked several more questions about the Meng Tian Universe. From the two of them, he learned that the strongest God of Creation in the Meng Tian Universe was called Meng Tian, and he had reached the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm! He had 9.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

However, they hadn’t heard anything about a God of Creation called Xuan Hai.

Soon after, he asked about the universe-level spiritual vein in the Dragon Cave.

The two of them looked extremely guilty when he asked about it.

“The spiritual vein is located in a separate space in the Dragon Cave. There are countless restrictions around it, and not even the two of us will be able to enter as we wish,” Long Yi explained.

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised. He didn’t know that there was such a place in the Dragon Cave! Since it could stop the both of them, the restrictions around it definitely weren’t weak.

The three of them soon arrived at the space Long Yi was talking about.

Even though they were already deep in the Dragon Cave, they had to travel another half a day before arriving at the entrance to the separate space.

“Your Highness, this is the place we’re talking about.” Long Yi pointed at the void before them and all Huang Xiaolong could see was a vast space with tiny stars twinkling about.

The stars in the space before him looked like massive jewels, and on closer examination, Huang Xiaolong realized that they were ores! They were extremely rarely seen dragon-attributed spiritual stones, and only god knew how old they were.

There was nothing else other than the ores. Dragon qi filled the space before him, and they were so thick that they looked like massive dragons rolling about.

“The dragon essence here is really thick…” Huang Xiaolong gasped.

If an expert who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand completion stage cultivated in the space, they would gain endless benefits! It was too bad it was useless for Huang Xiaolong.

After asking about the location of the spiritual vein, Huang Xiaolong got them to wait where they were before he disappeared with a single stop.

The separate dragon space was created during the formation of the universe, and the restrictions were pretty damn strong. Not even Huang Xiaolong dared to mess about. He released his dao souls and traveled carefully. He found several Flowers of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle, and there were countless strands of Dragon Heart Grass. Of course, there were also many precious herbs.

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong arrived before the spiritual vein. It was like a giant dragon that was coiled up in the space before him, and he couldn’t see its end.

It didn’t take too long before Huang Xiaolong retrieved the spiritual vein. He tossed it into the Sun Moon Furnace, and it was larger than anything he had ever obtained! The furnace trembled violently in an attempt to contain it.

“Looks like I’ll have to find a way to upgrade the furnace…” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

The Sun Moon Furnace was a pseudo-creation artifact like the Purple Lightning Peak, but it seemed as though it was falling behind.

After obtaining the spiritual vein, Huang Xiaolong didn’t rush to leave. He continued looking around as he didn’t know what he would be able to find in the vast space before him.
