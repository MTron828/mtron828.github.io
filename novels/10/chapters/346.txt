Chapter 347: You Broke Through Half-Saint?

Black and blue twin dragons swirled in the air above Huang Xiaolong, the dragon might emanating from his body grew stronger and more intense as time passed and seemingly faint echoes of dragon roars could be heard.

Simultaneously, in the upper part of Huang Xiaolong’s Qi Sea, powerful energies, the sacred golden Buddha luminescence and the dark fiendish glow, rolled and fused, creating tears in space.

Time ticked by, when all of a sudden, a crack appeared in the top section of Huang Xiaolong’s Qi Sea. But it was a minuscule crack, very unstable, real one second and fading the next.

One day passed.

This tiny, minuscule crack gradually grew bigger, reaching the size of a thumb and growing more stable as well. The aureate glow of the Buddha luminescence and the Archdemon’s dark energy swirled, penetrating into the opening and blending as one with the growing fissure.

Two days went by.

The fissure continued to enlarge, reaching the size of an adult’s arm at the end of the two months’ time.

The aura emanating from Huang Xiaolong’s body amplified, the contrasting Buddha luminescence and devil glow surged in a neverending manner. The dragon might more than doubled, its oppressive pressure was overwhelming.

Another month passed.

By now, the fissure in Huang Xiaolong’s Qi Sea reached half a meter wide and one zhang tall, emitting both devil aura and Buddha luminescence.

Days passed. In the blink of an eye, two more months went by. The space rift was now one meter wide, surpassing one zhang in height, the surging devil aura and Buddha luminescence grew ever more compelling.

The dragon roars echoing from Huang Xiaolong’s body grew more frequent and clear, the Saint power accumulating inside his body began filling the entire temple hall when Huang Xiaolong suddenly shook. The robe he was wearing was blasted into pieces as a ray of Saint light shot out from his Qi Sea straight to the core of his soul. Enshrouded by the Saint light, his soul trembled, undergoing a baptism and reshaping.

A long time later, the bright light cocooning Huang Xiaolong dissipated, the dark devil aura and Buddha luminescence also vanished from the temple hall, but opening his eyes, both lights were present in the deep end of his eyes in the form of a golden Buddha statue and an Archdemon statue! A vigorous Saint power bubbled forth! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

‘I finally broke through to the Saint realm!’ Huang Xiaolong stood up, unable to hide the mad delight he felt, a reverberating dragon roar rang from his mouth. The black and blue twin dragons followed, roaring endlessly.

Saint realm! A realm that was considered as a genuine expert!

Once one broke into the Saint realm, their identity, position, and status would take a great leap, furthermore, their lifespan would increase significantly, stretching past the limit of a millennium. Moreover, in the future, as Huang Xiaolong would continue to break through to higher realms, his lifespan would become longer proportionately, two thousand years, three thousand years, and more!

It took a while for Huang Xiaolong to calm down enough to check the internal situation of his body.

First of all, his Qi Sea. That rift above his Qi Sea was his Saint realm space formed from his comprehension of the space law, and what surprised Huang Xiaolong was that his Saint realm space differed from Zhao Chen’s and Ao Baixue’s, whose Saint realm spaces were both were of singular color. His Saint realm space was a fusion two colors―gold and black!

Multiple streams of gold and black lights glimmered around his Saint realm space, Buddha luminescence and devil aura flickering in and out, sending Huang Xiaolong into a daze.

“This?!” He remembered Zhao Shu mention in the past that only one type of energy could exist within a Saint realm warrior’s Saint realm space, but him, his Saint realm space had two? Did a mutation happen to his Saint realm space like it did with his martial spirits?

‘It seems I need to ask both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu when I go out why it’s like this...’ Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself and then moved on to check other changes in his body.

Huang Xiaolong’s internal organs and other parts looked as if they were soaked in the spring of life, vivid vitality was effervescent from his meridians, veins, even his skin and hair. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong noticed that his flesh and muscles were tougher than ever before, every cell contained terrifying power.

At the very end, Huang Xiaolong scanned his soul, where one of the most significant transformations took place. In the past, his soul sea was merely a vast ocean but now, five new mainlandsㅡmetal, wood, water, fire, and earth appeared above his soul sea-five elements mainland.

From the five elements mainland, five elements aura resonated with each other, swirling, forming a protective barrier.

Dauntless confidence rose from Huang Xiaolong’s heart that if he were to battle Zhao Chen once more, just by the raw strength of his two arms, he was capable of tearing Zhao Chen into halves. This feeling was born out of the confidence in his own strength.

Huang Xiaolong was very satisfied looking at his beautifully chiseled muscles that were close to perfection, yet did not lack in softness.

En, Huang Xiaolong nodded with appreciation, after breaking into Saint realm his ‘baggage’ below seemed to have increased a size bigger.

...

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong took out a light azure robe from the Asura Ring and put it on. Just as he was about to do so, he caught sight of the nameless fire tree, which also grew a little bit taller.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. Could it be that while he was in the midst of breaking through the Saint realm, the Saint power released from his body was beneficial to this nameless fire tree?

Pondering, Huang Xiaolong lifted a hand and sucked a red fruit off a branch, swallowing it down. A stream of warm energy spread inside Huang Xiaolong’s body, comfortable and delicious to boot. After swallowing the red fruit, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the energy inside the fruit was more abundant than the time he first discovered them at the Broken Tiger Rift. The difference was obvious.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong exited the Godly Mt. Xumi.

When he walked into the grand hall, his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, younger brother Huang Xiaohai, as well as both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were there. His sister Huang Min and brother-in-law Gui Tai had already returned to the Guo Manor together with the little one, Guo Xiaofan.

“What are you all talking about, being so lively?” Huang Xiaolong asked, smiling.

“Long’er, you’re out from practice!” Seeing Huang Xiaolong appeared, joy filled Su Yan’s face as she stood, so did everyone else.

“Young Lord!” Both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu stepped forward in their salute.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, took a seat as among the chairs.

“Long’er, did you really kill that Deities Templar Elder Ao Baixue?” Everyone was seated, Huang Peng couldn’t resist his curiosity any longer, asking Huang Xiaolong. This matter had spread far and wide, not only in Duaren Empire, but nearly all the empires on the Snow Wind Continent were discussing this subject. To say that every inch of land on Snow Wind Continent was talking about this was far from an exaggeration.

Hearing Huang Peng ask the crucial question, all eyes in the hall turned to Huang Xiaolong. All of them knew that when Huang Xiaolong first returned, there was giant ghost Feng Yang by his side, perhaps Huang Xiaolong and Feng Yang killed Ao Baixue together?

Looking at the expressions around him, Huang Xiaolong smiled, “I killed him.” Huang Xiaolong’s words clearly confirmed the rumors flying outside.

Huang Xiaohai interjected with enthusiastic excitement, “Big bro, now all the empires on Snow Wind Continent are talking about this, you’ve already become the most legendary figure to come out of the Snow Wind Continent! Even surpassing our Emperor Duanren!”

Most legendary figure? Huang Xiaolong chuckled hearing this term.

“Long’er, the rumors outside say you’re already a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order?” Su Yan asked. Although she was Huang Xiaolong’s mother, like everyone else, she found it hard to believe that Huang Xiaolong had reached such heights in cultivation.

Due to the uniqueness of Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation technique, concealing the traces of his aura, not even Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu could determine Huang Xiaolong’s actual strength.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “I just broke through today.”

Broke through!

Huang Peng, Su Yan, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu blanked with shock, and then joy descended.

“Young Lord, you’re now a half-Saint?” Zhao Shu tried to determine with expectations in his voice.

An order above peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order was half-Saint realm.

Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly inside, before everyone’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong stopped concealing his aura. The released power surged out like a tsunami, shaking the heavens!
