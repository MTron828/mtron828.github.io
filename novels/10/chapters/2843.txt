Chapter 2844: People From the Yu Family

Long Jianfei blanked for a second, then elation rushed to his face as he faced Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, you mean you can…?!”

When he heard Long Chenfeng say that the curse on his father, elder brother, and the others was placed by a Dao Venerable expert, he subconsciously thought that Huang Xiaolong had no way to resolve it. But now, he grasped at the glimmer of hope in Huang Xiaolong’s words.

On the other hand, Long Chenfeng and other Long Family’s experts looked at Huang Xiaolong in astonishment when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s words. Could it be that His Highness is also a Dao Venerable expert?!

“Your Highness is a Dao Venerable expert?” Long Chenfeng asked cautiously.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “No.”

The answer brought a bout of disappointment in everyone’s heart, but considering Huang Xiaolong’s status, Long Chenfeng and the others didn’t dare to show their disappointment on their faces.

Long Chenfeng organized his words in his head before saying to Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei, “Your Highness, Young Lord, all these years, we’ve invited many experts to check the Old Patriarch and the others’ condition. We even invited a lot of half-step Dao Venerable experts, but even perfection half-step Dao Venerables are powerless against this curse. There was even the risk of suffering backlash if they were a little careless!”

Long Chenfeng was putting it subtly that if Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a Dao Venerable expert, he wouldn’t be able to get rid of the curse on the Long Family’s Old Patriarch and the others.

He reminded Huang Xiaolong out of kindness, to prevent him from suffering the same end resulting from the backlash of the curse.

In truth, this whole time, they had thought of inviting a Dao Venerable expert to help them lift the curse, however, the price of inviting a Dao Venerable expert was too high to the point that their Long Family could not afford it.

Then Long Chenfeng turned to face Long Jianfei and explained, “Young Lord, since you’re back, we can request help from the Dragon Fish Creed’s Dao Venerable. As long as the Dragon Fish Creed is willing to help, the curse on the Old Patriarch and the others could definitely be lifted!”

Long Jianfei shook his head. If his master Chen Xi was around, the Dragon Fish Creed’s Dao Venerables might have extended a hand for his master’s sake. But the current situation was, both he and his master had been missing for many years. Then, how would those Dao Venerable experts help save his family?

After all, the curse placed by a Dao Venerable was extremely powerful. Even a Dao Venerable expert in the same realm as the curse caster would need to exert a lot of effort to lift the curse, and it would ruin a portion of their own small world’s energy.

“Your Highness,” Long Jianfei gave Huang Xiaolong a pleading look and suddenly knelt on the floor and begged, “I beg Your Highness, please help my father, mother, and the others!”

“I, Long Jianfei, am your most humble servant to repay Your Highness’ grace!”

These words were a little heavy.

However, Long Jianfei pleaded Huang Xiaolong to save his family at the risk of damaging his small world’s energy, and with Huang Xiaolong’s identity as the Son of Creation, it was indeed a grace that was hard to repay.

Long Chenfeng and the others were startled seeing Long Jianfei pleading on his knees. Despite Long Jianfei introducing Huang Xiaolong as His Highness to them, none of them really put much importance on Huang Xiaolong himself.

It was at this moment that they realized that Huang Xiaolong’s identity was definitely not as simple as they had thought.

“All of you, quickly kneel down!”

While Long Chenfeng and the others were still in a dazed shock, Long Jianfei issued an order.

Long Chenfeng and the others snapped to their senses and plopped down on their knees.

Huang Xiaolong bent slightly and helped Long Jianfei up, “Jianfei, don’t speak such words between us. Your affairs are my affairs, and of course, I will help.”

Even if Long Jianfei had not begged him for help, Huang Xiaolong would have helped as much as he could have. After all, Long Jianfei’s parents, elder brother, and younger sister were a part of their group now.

Long Jianfei saluted Huang Xiaolong again with gratitude.

After Huang Xiaolong had everyone stand up from the floor, he approached the ice coffin Long Jianfei’s father was in. Lying inside the ice coffin, Long Jianfei’s father was still as dead, and a foul stench lingered around his body.

Rotten flesh was the cause of this stench.

Huang Xiaolong was aware that this was one of the curse’s side effects. Otherwise, with the support from the ice coffin, someone who was still alive couldn’t possibly exude this kind of stench.

Profound ice could prevent any item from deteriorating.

Moreover, Long Jianfei’s father was a perfection half-step Dao Venerable. Therefore, it was impossible for his body to exude such a stench.

Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls penetrated into Long Jianfei’s father’s body to check his situation, and he had a deeper understanding of his situation.

“All of you go out first,” Huang Xiaolong said to Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, Long Chenfeng, and the rest, “No one is allowed to enter without my permission.”

Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and everyone else complied and stepped out of the building.

To avoid being disturbed in any way, Huang Xiaolong arranged restrictions around the building with a wave of his hand, separating the building from the outside world.

Huang Xiaolong stepped closer to the ice coffin with Long Jianfei’s father, and placed his palm above the air, and pressed down. The small world’s energy coursed through his body.

When the energy from Huang Xiaolong’s small world entered into the other person’s body, ear-piercing shrieks cut across the air as wisps of green smoke floated out from Long Jianfei’s father’s body, and this green smoke rushed towards Huang Xiaolong.

But before the green smoke got close to Huang Xiaolong, it was dissipated by the energy from Huang Xiaolong’s small world.

In the blink of an eye, half a month passed by.

Those waiting outside stared fixedly at the building.

“Young Lord, there is no movement for so long, would His Highness…?” Long Chenfeng asked Long Jianfei worriedly.

Long Jianfei took a quick glance at Long Chenfeng, and he understood that Long Chenfeng was worried whether Huang Xiaolong had fallen victim to the curse.

“Don’t worry, His Highness will be fine,” Long Jianfei reassured him.

Long Chenfeng was genuinely surprised by Long Jianfei’s confidence towards Huang Xiaolong and could not figure out the reason for it.

Soon, a month had passed.

While everyone waited in anticipation, a bright light flickered over the building, and a second later, a figure walked out. Naturally, this was Huang Xiaolong.

Upon seeing Huang Xiaolong come out, Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and the others immediately become spirited.

“Your Highness!” A trace of joy rose to Long Jianfei’s face as he called out, and hurried forward with Duan Feng.

Looking at Long Jianfei’s worried and anxious expression, Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and smiled lightly, “It’s done.”

It’s done!

Hearing that, Long Jianfei trembled. His face was full of excitement as his feet crossed the distance in a few quick steps, and he entered the building. Long Chenfeng and other Long Family experts were astounded. Our Old Patriarch’s fine now? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The curse’s power has been expelled completely?

It was normal that they had doubted him. After all, they had tried every method they could think of for so many years, and they had invited numerous experts, but they were disappointed time after time. Eventually, they had become numb with disappointment.

Long Chenfeng and the rest entered the building with doubt in their hearts, but just as they stepped into the building, they saw that dozens of people had already come out from the ice coffins with robust faces. The corpse stench had disappeared, and all of them were meditating and adjusting their conditions.

Really, the curse is lifted?!

They could clearly feel that the curse in their bodies was no longer there.

This discovery shocked all of the Long Family’s experts.

Not even a Dao Venerable was able to lift the curse cast by the Dao Venerable expert!

What surreal world is this?!

All the Long Family’s experts looked at Huang Xiaolong with reverence.

Right at this time, the entire Dragon City trembled as if hit by an earthquake.

Long Chenfeng and the others’ faces ashened at this sudden change.

“It’s, it’s the Yu Family’s people. The Yu Family is here again!” In these years, the Yu Family’s people had taken to harassing, suppressing, and bullying their Long Family’s disciples as fun.
