Chapter 2290: Full Mobilization!

Huang Xiaolong raised his arm and interrupted Wu Chengkun, “Go inform your island master about my presence. Let him bring the law enforcers of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island here to welcome me.”

Wu Chengkun stared at him in shock, and he didn’t know how to reply.

Raising his finger to point towards Wu Chengkun’s forehead, a hole soon emerged from the other side of Wu Chengkun’s head. Wu Chengkun’s breathing stopped as he fell to the ground.

The various experts from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island looked at Wu Chengkun’s motionless body, and they didn’t dare to breathe loudly. Fear filled their hearts as they had no idea what Huang Xiaolong would do to them.

“You. Go, inform your island master about my presence. Let him bring the law enforcers of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island here to welcome me.” Huang Xiaolong turned to Gao Songyuan and repeated his orders again.

Gao Songyuan’s body trembled, and he turned deathly pale. However, he nodded his head eventually, “Yes, Your Highness.”

Huang Xiaolong ordered Gao Songyuan to hide his identity when making the report. The only thing Gao Songyuan needed to tell Wang Yuan was that the experts from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island were currently hostages on the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island. In order to bring them back, Wang Yuan would have to personally appear to pay a hefty ransom.

Based on Huang Xiaolong’s prices, they would need five hundred holy bills to redeem a single hostage.

Since there were around a hundred of them, Wang Yuan needed to pay fifty million holy bills!

Gao Songyuan listened to everything Huang Xiaolong said, and he obediently sent a report to Wang Yuan.

“Your Highness, what will happen to us?” Gao Songyuan looked at Huang Xiaolong as his heart pounded.

“Bring them to the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island’s prison.” Huang Xiaolong ignored Gao Songyuan and turned around to order Liu Zhi.

Acknowledging his order, Liu Zhi and the others got ready to bring the prisoners away.

The expressions on the faces of Gao Songyuan and those from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island changed.

“Your Highness, we...!” Gao Songyuan couldn’t complete his sentence before Liu Zhi interrupted him. After sealing the energy in the bodies of all the experts from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island, he brought them away.

When Gao Songyuan and the others were sent to the prison, Wang Yuan’s transmission symbol shook. On the Divine Sea Spiritual Island hundreds of millions of miles away from the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island, Wang Yuan’s expression slowly changed.

“Lord Island Master this...?” Chen Yizhen, an enforcer of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island noticed the change to Wang Yuan, and he could’t help but ask.

Wang Yuan threw the transmission symbol over, and Chen Yizhen looked through it. His jaws dropped in shock. “This... This can’t be real....”

Like Wang Yuan, he didn’t believe the news.

As the various enforcers in the hall learned of the news, they didn’t know how to react.

“All one hundred and three of them were captured by the enemy?! They were stopped by Liu Zhi of the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island! How can something like this even happen? They even expect us to pay them a ransom of five hundred thousand per person?!” Xu Zijia stared at the transmission symbo,l and he felt that it was completely ridiculous. However, he soon laughed. “Gao Songyuan is getting more and more outrageous. How dare he play tricks like this on us?!”

Xu Zijia turned to Shao Xinpeng, another enforcer, and said, “Brother Xinpeng, Gao Songyuan is one of your men. Are you sure his behavior is acceptable in the Divine Sea Spiritual Island?”

A frown formed on Shao Xinpeng’s face and he shook his head. “It’s impossible for Gao Shaoyuan to pull a joke like this.”

Another enforcer agreed. “That’s true. Someone like Gao Shaoyuan wouldn’t joke around like this.”

Everyone in the hall looked at each other, as they felt lost.

Finally, Wang Yuan got to his feet as a cold glint flashed through his eyes. “If this is true, there has to be someone standing behind Liu Zhi!”

According to the intelligence they had gathered on the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island, there were less than twenty Venerables in the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island. With Wu Chengkun, Gao Shaoyuan, and the others, they had the ability to raze the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island to the ground if they wanted to!

However, Gao Songyuan had actually said that all of them were captured by Liu Zhi!

“Did the Sandy Island step in?” Xu Zijia muttered all of a sudden.

Even though the Divine Sea Spiritual Island was pretty strong, and they controlled a portion of the seas, they weren’t lacking in competitors. The Sandy Island was one of them. Since the Sandy Island was closer to the Divine Sea Spiritual Island, they would clash with each other frequently.

It was reasonable for Xu Zijia to pin everything on the Sandy Island.

“Sandy Island!” Chen Yizhen raged the moment he heard their name. Fire burned in his eyes as he growled, “If the members of the Sandy Island are behind this, hehehe!” A sinister smile appeared on his face when he mentioned them.

In the past, his personal disciple had died at the hands of the experts from the Sandy Island.

“Regardless of whoever the people behind Liu Zhi are, we have to save Gao Songyuan and the others!” Wang Yuan muttered resolutely.

“Does Island Master mean that we will be giving them fifty million holy bills?!” Xu Zijia asked.

A cold smile formed on Wang Yuan’s face. “Of course! Let’s go and see if they have the ability to take my fifty million!”

Regardless, Wang Yuan decided to play it safe and conduct another investigation on the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island before they killed their way over.

Very quickly, the reports arrived, and Wang Yuan was stunned for a solid second.

“The person behind Liu Zhi is a mere peak early-Tenth Order Sovereign?!” Wang Yuan didn’t dare to believe his eyes when he read the report.

“Yes, Island Master, the only problem is that no one knows of the brat’s origins.” Xu Zijia laughed.

“Haha! It’s just a puny little Sovereign!” Chen Yizhen roared with laughter. “It seems like the brat is a young master of a certain super family! If he only has Liu Zhi under his command, the faction behind him wouldn’t be too strong!”

Wang Yuan nodded his head and laid down his order to gather all the experts in the Divine Sea Spiritual Island.

Several hours later, Wang Yuan and the experts of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island flew on a flying ship as they headed straight for the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island.

In Gao Songyuan’s report, Huang Xiaolong had only requested for Wang Yuan and the enforcers of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island to head over. However, Wang Yuan wasn’t planning on holding back. He gathered all the experts the Divine Sea Spiritual Island had to offer and charged right over. He brought five thousand Venerable Realm experts along with the enforcers.

That was basically all the Venerable Realm experts the Divine Sea Spiritual Island could send out.

Even though the other party was only a Sovereign Realm expert, Wang Yuan was prepared to decimate the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island by mobilizing the full strength of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island.

There were plenty of Venerables in the Divine Sea Spiritual Island and even peak-level factions wouldn’t be able to send out five thousand Venerables at one go! Even though there wasn’t a single high-level Venerable on the side of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island, they made up for it in quantity.

Thinking about supreme sects of dynasties under the Holy Gate, supreme sects like the Nine Heavens Gate only had several Venerable Realm experts!

Any dynasty would be hard-pressed to face five thousand Venerables, even if they were low-leveled ones!

“Your Highness, Wang Yuan and the others are currently on their way.” Liu Zhi quickly received the report from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island the moment Wang Yuan left.

“Is he coming with the enforcers?” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in satisfaction.

Liu Zhi shook his head. “Even though it seems like he only brought the enforcers, he also brought along a ton of Venerable Realm experts in the dark. He seemed to have mobilized the full strength of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island!”

One of the guardians, who overheard the conversation chuckled, “If Wang Yuan learns that that was your original plan all along, I wonder how he will react!”

Taking them all down at once was indeed Huang Xiaolong’s intention.

“I would need to trouble seniors to make a move....” Huang Xiaolong chuckled as he bowed towards the four guardians.

“That’s easy. Doyen Li Wen requested for us to protect Your Highness. We can’t possibly remain idle when the other side has so many Venerables.”

Laughter filled the hall.

Several days later, a flying ship appeared in the horizon as Wang Yuan and the experts of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island disembarked. They stood in the space above the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island and stared at the Mirage Sea Spiritual City.

A cold light flashed through Wang Yuan’s eyes when he looked at the city standing before him.
