Chapter 3057: Destiny Race

Huang Xiaolong nodded. Although Yang Sandao and the other two people had strength at par with the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Ancestor’s, he didn’t put the matter to heart. The Devil Essence Holy Dragon was strong, but that level of strength was similar to his subordinate Old Monster Flame. Whether it was the four of them or forty of them, he would deal with them just the same.

“Right, Your Highness, the Prince of Origin is also here.” Lei Yu supplemented.

“Oh,” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow, and was just a tad surprised.

Even the Prince of Origin has come to the Heavens Burial Lands? It seems the changes in the Heavens Burial Lands this time is really related to some great treasure?

But that treasure was definitely not the pure soil. If the Prince of Origin, and the main Mystical Pavilion’s experts knew pure soil was here, they would have rushed to the Ocean of Suffering immediately.

“Where are they now?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help asking.

Lei Yu answered, “The Prince of Origin is still at the Golden Flame Sandy Land, and according to the news, he encountered a fortuitous adventure in the Golden Flame Sandy Land and comprehended the power of absolute blaze. The Mystical Pavilion’s Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor and the others subsequently entered the Golden Flame Sandy Land.”

“Golden Flame Sandy Land,” Huang Xiaolong repeated.

Lei Yu nodded, “Yes, the Golden Flame Sandy Land.”

Huang Xiaolong pondered for a moment and decisively said, “We’re going to the Golden Flame Sandy Land now.”

Huang Xiaolong was keen to capture the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor to get information about Huang Shuai’s whereabouts.

Moreover, one of the reasons they entered the Heavens Burial Lands this time was to rescue Lei Yu’s trapped eldest disciple. According to the information given by the Mystical Pavilion Golden Fox Branch Master Mou Baicheng, Lei Yu’s eldest disciple, Chen Ming, was trapped inside the Fox Mounds.

They would be passing by the Fox Mounds on the way to the Golden Flame Sandy Land.

Having decided, Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, and the rest set off to the Golden Flame Sandy Land without delay.

However, Huang Xiaolong did not have Feng Wuji, and Su Hong follow him, allowing them to ‘roam’ freely.

Other experts’ gazes followed as Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, Old Monster Flame, and the rest left the Sea of Skulls, and various thoughts crossed their minds, seeing Su Hong bowing respectfully as he sent off Huang Xiaolong. They really could not understand what caused Su Hong’s sudden change of attitude towards Huang Xiaolong. It could be said that Su Hong’s right-hand man, Wang Haoyang had died in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

Did Su Hong find out that young man’s identity? Is that why his attitude towards that young man became so respectful?

“That young man won’t be the Destiny Race’s young patriarch, right?” After Feng Wuji and Su Hong’s group left the Sea of Skulls, one of the remaining experts muttered in surprise.

Others who heard him trembled, looking visibly apprehensive—Destiny Race!

Destiny Race!

They were the acknowledged number-one race in the Origin Holy World!

For some people, the Destiny Race was not merely the Origin Holy World’s number-one race, but the entire Huang Long World’s number-one race!

On the Origin Holy World’s Extermination List, the Mystical Pavilion Master ranked first, and the second wasn't the Origin Holy World Master, but the Destiny Race’s patriarch!

The Origin Holy World Master ranked third.

Some even claimed that the Destiny Race Patriarch’s strength was at par with the Mystical Pavilion Master, the reason why the Destiny Race’s Patriarch ranked second was merely because of the race’s low-profile. In fact, the Mystical Pavilion Master and Destiny Race Patriarch had yet to battle each other.

“Maybe, there’s this possibility.”

There were experts who nodded seriously as if they were convinced of it.

Seemingly, everyone tacitly agreed that this was the most logical explanation for Su Hong’s sudden change in behavior towards the young man…

“Young Lady, could that young man really be the Destiny Race’s young patriarch? Among the group of female disciples, one of them asked the young woman with a veil over her face.

The veiled-young woman shook her head. “It’s not likely. The Destiny Race’s young patriarch’ strength cannot be so low being only at early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. Rumor has it that the Destiny Race’s young patriarch entered the peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable many thousand years ago.”

“It is said the Destiny Race’s patriarch has the power of absolute time and absolute space, and both absolute powers might have reached perfection level. I don’t know if that is true,” said the female disciple.

“It’s just a rumor, not necessarily true,” the veiled-young woman said, a light shone in her eyes as she added, “However, if the Destiny Race Patriarch really wields the power of absolute time and absolute space, and has reached perfection level, he would really be able to defy the will of heavens and change destiny, holding the power of life and death and time in his hands, and just thinking about it is scary.”

……

Huang Xiaolong had no knowledge of these people’s thoughts and guesses, as he, Lei Yu, and the others were hurrying towards the Golden Flame Sandy Land at this moment.

On the way there, Lei Yu also mentioned to Huang Xiaolong that Jin Hongyuan and Wind Cloud Dao Venerable had obtained the Tree of Nightmare at the Dream Cave, as well as the treasures other forces had obtained during this time.

Despite not taking a step out of the world inside the golden Buddha statue in the last few months, the news had even reached the experts who had entered the golden Buddha statue’s world.

“In the last few months, so many treasures appeared in the Heavens Burial Lands.” Huang Xiaolong fell into contemplation. “Why would so many treasures appear in the same period of time?”

Lei Yu was just as baffled as Huang Xiaolong, “I feel something’s strange as well. Although treasures would appear from time to time in the past, definitely not in waves like this.”

“The Fox Mounds are up ahead.” A day later, Lei Yu said as he pointed at an undulation of hills. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

The Fox Mounds was quite famous in the Heavens Burial Lands because all kinds of fox beasts lived here, and there were more than a few peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm fox beasts.

Huang Xiaolong’s group directly flew towards the Fox Mound Mountain.

Lei Yu’s eldest disciple, Chen Ming, was trapped inside this Fox Mound Mountain.

As Huang Xiaolong’s group headed to the Fox Mound Mountain, they encountered several groups of fox beasts’ attacks. Then again, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu didn’t need to do anything, as all these fox beasts were swiftly and cleanly dealt with by Old Monster Flame and the rest.

They entered the Fox Mound Mountain, and came to the spot where Mou Baicheng’s expedition group had opened the treasury. They entered all the way and finally found the trapped Chen Ming, as well as a dozen other experts. Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu also rescued them by the way.

“Master!” Chen Ming cried out when he was rescued. He recognized Lei Yu in a glance, and tears flowed out uncontrollably as he knelt in front of Lei Yu, sobbing his heart out, rendering Lei Yu speechless.

A short while later, Lei Yu brought Chen Ming to greet Huang Xiaolong.

The dozen of experts that were trapped all knew Chen Ming, and seeing Chen Ming sobbing on his knees in front of Lei Yu, calling Lei Yu his master, made them dumbfounded.

“You, you are Lord Lei Yu?!” a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable stammered, looking at Lei Yu in disbelief.

Lei Yu faced that person, feeling somewhat familiar, and thus asked, “You are?”

“Lord Lei Yu, I am Xiaoan. Ten Swords’ eldest disciple.” the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert answered ecstatically.

“Ten Swords!” Hearing the name, Lei Yu let out a hearty laugh, “So, it’s you kid. That’s why I was wondering why you looked so familiar. I didn’t expect the little brat from the past to be already a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert.”

Ten Swords was one of his good friends. When he had left the Origin Holy World, Xiaoan was barely ten years old.

“How’s your master faring?” Lei Yu asked.

Xiaoan immediately looked crestfallen at that question. “My master has been missing for several million years.”

Missing?! Lei Yu was startled.

Other experts were looking at Lei Yu in surprise. Could this three-headed beast be the Leiyu Creed’s founder ancestor?

Although Lei Yu had left a long time ago, these experts still remembered some of Lei Yu’s feats from the past.
