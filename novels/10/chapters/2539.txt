Chapter 2540: Your Guess is Spot On!

Ji Xinyi stared at her junior sister, and she quickly tried to reassure her, “Junior Sister, you don’t have to worry about him. Xie Bufan wouldn’t dare to kill Huang Xiaolong. If they do the irreversible deed, the four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens would definitely go crazy. Even the Devil Palace would have to think twice before provoking the four experts.”

Forcing a smile, Lin Xiaoying replied, “Senior Sister, you don’t have to lie to me. Xie Bufan will stop at nothing to kill Huang Xiaolong. Qiao Jinyang gave him the Fiend Moon Blade, and his intentions are clear.”

“Huang Xiaolong definitely has a dao artifact to protect himself. After all he’s the disciple of the four Primal Ancestors. Even with the Fiend Moon Blade, Xie Bufan will find it hard to destroy Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul.”

Lin Xiaoying nodded sadly. “Let’s hope that’s the case. However, I’ve heard that Qiao Jinyang sealed a hundred grand dao laws into the Fiend Moon Blade this time.”

Ji Xinyi’s heart sank.

Countless years passed, and Huang Xiaolong who was seated in the middle of the hall, opened his eyes. Exhaling a long breath, he finally completed the entire process.

Not only did he obtain the Cangqiong Old Man’s grand dao energy, but he also obtained the carious high-grade holy arts and grand dao laws the old man comprehended.

“Cangqiong Strike!”

That was the grand dao law comprehended by the old man.

With a single strike, boundless energy would swallow the enemy! Nothing could stand in his way! Primal Ancestors who stood in his way would be slaughtered without the slightest bit of resistance!

After accepting the inheritance, Huang Xiaolong could finally celebrate the fact that he had entered the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

When he opened his eyes previously, he consolidated his strength and everything he had learned from the Cangqiong Old Man. The grand dao law he comprehended had reached a whole new level, and he had already solidified his foundations at the early-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

This time, he had crossed four great tribulations at once and his holy souls and Dao Heart had undergone a huge transformation.

“Thirty-two years… The Saint Fate will appear in thirty-two years,” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

After breaking into the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong was able to accurately sense the time the Saint Fate would appear in the world.

Since he was already a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint, there was nothing left to worry about.

Of course, he wanted to accept the Black Corpse Holy Emperor's inheritance before he fought for the Saint Fate. After all, that was his ticket to the peak of the late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

Even though he could receive the Saint Fate at the early-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, it would be much more effective to do it when he was at the peak of the late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

Moreover, the amount of energy he could absorb when entering the True Saint Realm played a part.

“It seems like it’s time…” Huang Xiaolong retrieved Li Chen’s holy soul from the Black Corpse Holy Ring.

Now that he was done with the inheritance, it was time to devour Li Chen and Xie Bufan.

Li Chen was first on the list.

After Li Chen appeared, his expression changed when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, please release me! I’ll do anything you say as long as I can live!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. Li Chen was indeed a little too delusional.

Without hesitation, Huang Xiaolong devoured Li Chen’s saint attributes along with his holy soul.

The Myriad Creation Saint Godhead was ranked fifth among all the saint godheads in the Holy World! As for Xie Bufan, the seventh-ranked saint godhead wasn’t too bad either. After devouring the two, Huang Xiaolong’s Saint godheads would probably enter the top ten ranks!

One day later…

In the outside world, Wu Ge’s expression changed as he made a report to Tyrant Chu. He spoke about Li Chen’s soul imprint shattering.

“Li Chen’s dead?!” Tyrant Chu’s expression sank.

“Lord Chu, there’s no mistake. It has to be Xie Bufan,” Wu Ge growled, “This means that His Highness Huang Xiaolong…”

There was no other reason for Li Chen’s soul imprint to shatter! After all, that could only mean one thing! Huang Xiaolong was next!

Tyrant Chu’s expression turned gloomy.

Previously, he was hoping that Huang Xiaolong would create another miracle and obtain the Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance. However, Li Chen’s death shattered his hopes.

Getting to his feet, Tyrant Chu charged out of the room.

“Lord Chu, this…?” Wu Ge asked timidly.

“We’re going to find Cao Nan!” Chilly light flashed through Tyrant Chu’s eyes, and he rushed towards the Devil Palace’s camp with Wu Ge and the others in tow.

…

In the Devil Palace’s camp. Someone rushed towards Cao Nan and screamed, “Good news, Lord Cao Nan, good news! Li Chen is dead!”

When Li Chen’s soul imprint shattered, those from the Devil Palace received the news immediately. Celebration broke out instantaneously as Li Chen’s death meant that a genius from the Holy Heavens was now dead! It also proved that Xie Bufan was the one to obtain the Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Pass down my order! A celebration is to be held!” Cao Nan roared with laughter.

A light hearted atmosphere filled the Devil Palace’s camp almost instantly.

“Lord Cao Nan, Tyrant Chu from the Holy Heavens is about to barge his way into the hall!” An expert from the Devil Palace screamed from outside.

“It’s fine! Let him do as he wishes!”

Without Cao Nan, not a single person from the Devil Palace could dream of stopping Tyrant Chu.

“Cao Nan, Xie Bufan killed the leader of the Holy Princes of my organization! Do you really think that we won’t dare to exterminate your Devil Palace?!”

Cao Nan chuckled, “Do you really think that you have the ability to do that?”

“Speak! What are your conditions for you to spare Huang Xiaolong?”

“Hehe! I want ten Primal Ancestor Dao Artifacts!” Cao Nan laughed sinisterly.

“You!” Tyrant Chu’s expression changed. No matter how rich the Holy Heavens was, it was impossible to bring out ten Primal Ancestor Dao Artifacts.

…

Back in the main hall of the Cangqiong Holy Manor, Huang Xiaolong set his sights on Xie Bufan.

One more day passed…
