Even though there were great treasures in every space within the Ice Palace, the precious treasures were hidden in the deeper spaces. Huang Xiaolong ignored the early spaces completely.

They weren’t useful to him in his current realm. He was looking for specific items such as the Yin Yang universe-level spiritual veins, Ice Marrow, and the Heart of Ice. Any herbs at the creation level came after that.

Gu Yuan and the others were overwhelmed by the speed at which they were flying through the Ice Palace.

Huang Xiaolong only stopped when he arrived at the nine hundredth space.

That was where the precious treasures were.

Moreover, there seemed to be a lot of experts at the God of Creation Realm hunting him down. Now that he was so deep in the Ice Palace, they wouldn’t be able to catch him even if they wanted to.

Not even Meng Tian could charge deep into the Ice Palace so quickly! He would need hundreds of years to arrive where Huang Xiaolong was currently, if not longer!

Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls after he stopped, and he started to look through every inch of the space he could.

After absorbing the runes around the Ice Palace, Huang Xiaolong could control the grand formation within. He could feel everything more clearly with the help of the grand formation, and it was easy for him to notice everything in the space he was in! Unlike other people who were like blind mice in the Ice Palace, Huang Xiaolong was basically using cheats!

However, every single space was massive. They were comparable to a giant holy world, and even with the help of the grand formation, Huang Xiaolong needed several days to look through the space he was in.

As Huang Xiaolong looked through the spaces in the Ice Palace, the news of Shi Li being forced to retreat by Huang Xiaolong started to spread through the universe. It shocked many experts who were on their way over to capture Huang Xiaolong.

At the same time, many experts felt like a bucket of cold water was thrown at them.

Everyone knew that Shi Li was a God of Creation at the large completion stage, and he had close to 4 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He was among the top thirty experts in the Meng Tian Universe!

Since someone like Shi Li was seriously injured by Huang Xiaolong, those weaker than him started to reconsider their options.

Not long after Shi Li’s escape started to spread, the news of Huang Xiaolong gaining control over the Ice Palace caused despair to fill the hearts of many experts who had hoped to capture him.

With the ability of the Ice Palace, who would be able to capture him if he hid himself inside?

Of course, there were still many people who were rushing over to the Ice River after learning the news.

That was because the secret of creating three worlds was too tempting! No one could stop themselves from thinking about it.

A figure appeared outside the Ice Palace one fine day, and the ice qi around the Ice Palace froze completely. 

The figure was extremely massive, and it looked like a giant hill as he stood there. His eyes were jade green, and he had a long braid hanging down his shoulders. He was Hu Ze, another God of Creation.

He was a God of Creation who was the second closest to the Ice River compared to Shi Li, and he was also at the large completion stage. He was slightly stronger with 4.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

He was the next to arrive!

Hu Ze frowned when he looked at the Ice palace standing before him. The runes around the structure had disappeared. It seemed as though the rumors were true! Huang Xiaolong had absorbed all the runes around it!

A light flashed in his eyes as he contemplated if he should enter the Ice Palace. 

Eventually choosing against it, he waited outside the Ice Palace.

A month quickly passed, and the number of Gods of Creation outside the palace increased to six!

There were two of them at the large completion stage, one of them was at the peak of the small completion stage, and another was at the small completion stage. The two remaining experts had just entered the God of Creation Realm.

All of them chose to wait outside the Ice Palace.

No one could blame them for their decision. Even if they entered the Ice Palace, they were basically screwed even if they ran into Huang Xiaolong.

In the Ice Palace, Huang Xiaolong entered the 901st space.

“That’s a piece of Ice Jade Spirit!”

“Nine Colored Ice Lotus! It even has thirteen petals!”

…

Gu Yuan and the others grabbed treasure after treasure as they followed behind Huang Xiaolong.

The Ice Jade Spirit they found was countless times better than the one Shi Li abandoned to look for Huang Xiaolong.

The Nine Colored Ice Lotus was in no way worse than the Ice Jade Spirit.

Those treasures were extremely useful to Gu Yuan and the others.

As they were of limited use to him, Huang Xiaolong gave all of them to the three. He was only interested in treasures of a higher grade!

Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong and the others swept the 901st space clean and went towards the 902nd. Through the grand formation, Huang Xiaolong saw the number of experts outside the Ice Palace, and a sneer formed on his lips.

All of them couldn’t see what was going on inside, but Huang Xiaolong could see the situation outside clearly. Meng Tian, the strongest expert in the Meng Tian Universe hadn’t arrived. Despite that, Bei Ting, who was nearly chopped in half by Huang Xiaolong, came back.

He wasn’t alone. He came back with two other experts.

Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of familiarity from one of them. It seemed as though the individual had the Huang Long Bloodline too!

Huang Muyang?!

There was no doubt about it. After all, Huang Muyang was a God of Creation at the large completion stage.

From the looks of it, Bei Ting formed an alliance with Huang Muyang. Could he have entered Meng Tian’s camp? After all, Huang Muyang was Meng Tian’s general.

Snorting lightly, Huang Xiaolong continued to look through the 902nd space. A shocking aura filled the space outside the Ice Palace, and the aura surpassed even Huang Xiaolong’s master, the Blazing Dragon!

“We greet Lord Meng Tian!” 

The person who arrived was the God of Creation Meng Tian, the strongest expert in the Meng Tian Universe!

He was at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm!

“Is he still in there?” Meng Tian asked Huang Muyang after he arrived.

“Yes, Lord Meng Tian,” Huang Muyang replied respectfully. “He hasn’t emerged. Please rest assured that we have already sealed off the Ice River World. We placed restrictions everywhere, and we’ll know the moment he reappears!” 

Meng Tian shook his head and sighed. “What if he remains in there for a hundred million years? Are we going to waste our time waiting for him?” 

“This…” Huang Muyang frowned.
