The group of sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs cheered loudly, as the Lord Nine Dragons Envoy was overpowering void devil beast Xu Baisheng and Golden Brow Ancestor.

“Lord Nine Dragons Envoy’s mighty!”

Feng Yingying was gloating as she looked provocatively at Huang Xiaolong, and thought to herself, ‘wait till Lord Nine Dragons Envoy packs up that beast. After that, Huang Xiaolong will be nothing more than a piece of meat on the chopping board that she could slice and chop as she pleased.’

The killing intent and hatred intensified in her heart, as she recalled that Huang Xiaolong had given her a choice to be hisbe his subordinate Feng Er’s maid slave.

Huang Xiaolong and Feng Er... you slut, just wait... soon, I’m going to crush you bit by bit with my bare hands!

Especially that slut called Feng Er!

That petty maid had dared to taunt and ridiculed her!

She will make sure to torture her... that maid will not die that easily!

She would bring her back to the sea tribe first, and let all the sea tribe’s male disciples take their turns with her! Torture her a few hundred years!

As Feng Yingying continued indulging in her vengeful fantasies and plans for Feng Er, she became increasingly excited and her eyes glimmered with a venomous gleam.

Rumble~!

An earth shattering boom jolted Feng Yingying back to the present. When she looked in the direction of the source, the void devil beast Xu Baisheng had tumbled backwards as the Lord Nine Dragons Envoy’s blade qi had overpowered him.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng crashed into a corner of Fortune City. The ground shook and cracked beneath his body.

Seeing this, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy turned away from the void devil beast Xu Baisheng and looked at Huang Xiaolong. The corner of his mouth curved into a cold sneer as he said faintly, “Kid, it’s your turn! Are you prepared to be soul-searched? Don’t be afraid, I will use the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s unique method to search your soul; at worst, you might turn into a fool once I am done with you!”

With that said, his right hand bent into a claw as he grabbed Huang Xiaolong from across space.

He was confident that Huang Xiaolong would be an easy prey since he was merely a late-First Order Ancestor God Realm.

Just as the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy’s claw reached out to grab Huang Xiaolong’s head, an elephant’s trumpet suddenly rumbled through space, as if it was coming from a faraway era. Xiang Xun’s trumpet condensed into powerful soundwaves that swept mercilessly at the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy from the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

The special envoy’s face showed a hint of fear and he immediately leaped to a safer spot, while slashing towards the incoming sound waves using his Ghost King’s Great Blade.

“Heavenly Sword Splitting Soul—!”

A giant ray of destructive blade qi shot out.

This attack was more powerful from his previous attacks. In fact, it was many times more powerful than the attack that had overpowered Xu Baisheng.

But such a powerful blade qi was simply scattered by the soundwaves in front of everyone’s eyes!

The soundwaves clashed into the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy at shocking speed, and he was repelled back, while the sea tribes Ancestors and Patriarchs stared at him with wide-open eyes.

But another burst of elephant’s trumpet shook the air as an elephant several hundred zhang tall appeared in front of everyone. The giant elephant swung his long trunk and smacked the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy like he was smacking rubbish. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Pa! The Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s envoy was half buried into the distant mountain like a stake.

Rocks ricocheted all over, as the ground cracked and swayed.

Everyone was flabbergasted.

Feng Yingying, the sea tribe’s group, Black Ice Ancestor, Zhu Yi, and the others looked at the giant elephant that had appeared suddenly. No one dared to move as they were scared for their lives.

Black Ice Ancestor, Zhu Yi, and the others could tell that this giant elephant looked somewhat familiar! But where had they seen him?

Of course, Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er and Huang Xiaolong’s other subordinates knew that this giant elephant was not other than Xiang Xun.

As Xiang Xun had reverted to his true body and size, there were some differences in his skin’s surface. Therefore, no one was able to connect this giant elephant to the small elephant by Huang Xiaolong’s side.

Meanwhile, a destructive roar of wrath shattered the atmosphere.

When everyone turned to look at the source, the little cow was leisurely flying towards them in the air.

“I say, kiddo Xiang Xun, your speed is too fast, couldn’t you wait a little bit for this old cow?” The little cow said to the Xiang Xun.

...Kiddo Xiang Xun!

Black Ice Ancestor, Gate Chief Zhu Yi, Myriad Flames Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, even the injured Golden Brow Ancestor stared at the divine elephant Xiang Xun dumbfoundedly. Not to mention, this giant elephant had just smacked away the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy.

Wait a minute, isn’t this elephant ...?!

Black Ice Ancestor and Zhu Yi’s face ashened unknowingly as a possibility suddenly pooped in their minds.

Divine elephant Xiang Xun looked awkwardly at the little cow as he answered, “That’s because I was worried about Master ah.”

Master?

Subsequently, Black Ice Ancestor and Zhu Yi saw the divine elephant Xiang Xun approach Huang Xiaolong, and respectfully kneel in front of him. “Master, are you alright? This subordinate has come late! I accept my punishment!”

Naturally, Xiang Xun was referring to Golden Brow Ancestor and void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s injuries.

Master!

Black Ice Ancestor, Zhu Yi, and the others’ guesses were confirmed as the divine elephant Xiang Xun was being respectful towards Huang Xiaolong and addressing him as his Master.

As they had guessed, this elephant was the same small, common-looking elephant by Huang Xiaolong’s side!

Black Ice Ancestor felt as if the world had flipped over her. The ecstasy built in her heart from watching Xu Baisheng’s defeat, suddenly drained out leaving behind an empty and chilling coldness.

Feng Yingying, the sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs turned as white as a corpse.

Feng Yingying’s gloating, hatred, and murderous heart from earlier had vanished into the thin air, as she was gripped with fear and despair.

Huang Xiaolong inwardly heaved a sigh of relief as he looked at Xiang Xun, who was still kneeling in front of him. It was lucky that Xiang Xu had arrived in time to save them; if he had arrived a second later, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy would have turned Huang Xiaolong into a fool after searching his soul with secret technique!

“It is not your fault, stand up.” Huang Xiaolong said to Xiang Xun. Since Xiang Xun and the little cow had come out, did that mean that the evil spirit inside Li Lu’s body has been suppressed...?

Huang Xiaolong’s mood improved as he thought about this.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Feng Yingying and the rest of her group, as well as the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s envoy, and the corner of his lips curved into a cold smile.

In the meantime, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy had managed to pull himself out of the ground. He stood there in shock and outrage as he looked at his cracked divine armor. “Hell’s Ten Thousand Elephant Clan? As far as I know, the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan is one of Hell’s hegemon forces. You are a disciple of the Hell’s Ten Thousand Elephant Clan with a noble bloodline, then why are you acknowledging a human as your Master? I cannot figure out what could be the reason?!”

Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Zhu Yi, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, Black Ice Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and Sky Sword Ancestor looked at the divine elephant Xiang Xun, ’The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan?’ They suddenly remembered that Huang Xiaolong was at the Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City some days back!

Could it be that this giant elephant is...?!

Thinking of this, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, and the others’ hearts started beating madly.

This giant elephant is that five-billion-year petrified divine elephant!

Huang Xiaolong actually resurrected that petrified divine elephant! Then, does that mean the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan...?

Black Ice Ancestor’s face turned a shade paler.

Divine elephant Xiang Xun did not say anything, while Huang Xiaolong looked indifferently at the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy and said, "In this world, there are many things that you can’t figure out, and this is one of those things!" He turned to Xiang Xun and ordered, "Kill him!"

The Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy’s face ashened at Huang Xiaolong’s words, and he shouted, "I’m the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Yellow Dragon Hall’s Hall Chief Xuan Sun, how dare you kill me?!"

“The Yellow Dragon Hall’s Hall Chief Xuan Sun?”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression was extremely cold. "Kill!"

“So what if you’re the Yellow Dragon Hall’s Hall Chief Xuan Sun. You will be killed first!”
