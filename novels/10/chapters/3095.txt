Chapter 3096: Lord San Song

When Huang Xiaolong entered the main hall, he saw five people in total.

All five of them were peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables, and they weren’t ordinary experts. Their presence alone showed off the power possessed by the Mystical Pavilion.

When they saw Huang Xiaolong, none of them dared to put on airs as they got to their feet instantly. Cupping their fists, they greeted him, “Young Master Huang Xiaolong.”

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong allowed them to sit before heading over to the main seat in the hall.

“I wonder what you’re here for…” Huang Xiaolong didn’t feel like beating about the bush, and he asked.

The five of them looked at each other, and Chen Baili broke the silence. He chuckled, “Since Young Master Huang has asked, we shall not hide anything from you. We are here to invite Young Master Huang to the branch of the Mystical Pavilion in the Origin Heavenly Cave. We would like to trade some Liquid of Life for Pure Soil.”

Indeed. They were there for the Pure Soil in Huang Xiaolong’s possession.

Of course, he wasn’t surprised at all. There were many people who came to the Wind and Cloud Chamber of Commerce when he was in seclusion. Most of them came for the Pure Soil in his possession.

Feeling confident that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t refuse their request, Chen Baili revealed a smug smile. However, he was destined to be disappointed. Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “I have some Liquid of Life and Dazzling Gold Stone with me right now. Moreover, there are tons of people looking to trade those two items with me for some Pure Soil. If your Mystical Pavilion only has those two items, I’m afraid there’s no need for me to make a trip down to your branch.”

Chen Baili and the other four were stunned.

Hesitating for a second, the five of them looked at each other awkwardly.

“Of course, if you brought the Liquid of Life with you, I wouldn’t mind trading it with you.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Forcing a smile on his face, Chen Baili explained, “We rushed over and failed to bring anything with us…” His expression sank and he sighed, “I won’t hide anything from Young Master Huang… We have other treasures back at the branch, and there are many things more valuable than the Liquid of Life and Dazzling Gold Stone.”

Only stuff like the genesis lightning water, top-grade Phoenix Fire Crystals, and Rebirth Purple Crystal would be worth more than the Liquid of Life and Dazzling Gold Stone.

Widening his eyes in ‘pleasant surprise’, Huang Xiaolong pretended to yell in joy. “Do you mean that you have treasures like the genesis lightning water and top-grade Phoenix Flame Crystals?”

Laughing softly, Chen Baili didn’t admit to anything. “I wonder what Young Master Huang plans to do? Our Mystical Pavilion is sincerely inviting you to pay us a visit.” He quickly added, “Our branch master also said that if we failed to bring Young Master Huang back, he’ll skin us alive!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but joke with them. “Seems like I will have no choice but to go with you. If I refuse, your branch master might skin me alive too!”

An awkward laugh escaped Chan Baili’s lips when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Young Master Huang has to be kidding!”

Soon, the five of them took their leave.

When Lei Yu saw that they had finally left, he walked up and spoke to Huang Xiaolong. “Your Highness, there has to be something off about this. Wangu Xu wouldn’t invite you there for nothing.”

Wangu Xu was the name of the branch master of the Mystical Pavilion in the Origin Heavenly Cave.

The Cloud Wind Dao Venerable nodded in agreement. “That’s right. If Wangu Xu is sincere, he would have brought his treasures down to make a deal with Your Highness.”

Huang Xiaolong grinned and a crafty plan formed in his mind. “Do you think he’ll try to snatch the Pure Soil?”

“Other people might hesitate, but the Mystical Pavilion wouldn’t be afraid of Your Highness’ identity!” The Wind Cloud Dao Venerable sighed.

“Do you think I’m afraid of a mere Wangu Xu?” Huang Xiaolong asked in response.

Lei Yu and the others were stunned for a full second.

Huang Xiaolong continued, “I’m more afraid of him not making a move!”

If the other party made the first move, they would give him the perfect reason to retaliate. He had his eye on the Mystical Pavilion Branch’s treasury for a long time. After leaving seclusion, he was planning to turn the sixteen commanders of the Death Beast Army against the Mystical Pavilion Branch anyway.

“Your Highness, should I gather the experts of the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce?” The Wind and Cloud Dao Venerable questioned.

Nodding slowly, Huang Xiaolong thought of a plan. “Alright. However, just get those who can use absolute powers.”

Other than the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable, there were four other experts at that level.

Bowing respectfully, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable left to prepare.

“Your Highness, those who fanned the flames hoping for us to clash with the World Master’s Manor have already been smoked out of hiding. The Tyrant Beast Creed and the Mysterious Sparrow Creed are behind the stories.” Lei Yu seemed to have thought of something, and he reported.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. He wasn’t surprised at all. After all, he had killed Zhu Jingchen and Xie Li back in the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce.

“The Tyrant Beast Creed and the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch in the Origin Heavenly Cave seems pretty close.”

Lei Yu explained, “That’s right. The daughter of the Tyrant Beast Patriarch is the daughter-in-law of Eminent Elder Mu Guang of the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch.”

“Mu Guang?” Huang Xiaolong muttered the name under his breath. Mu Guang was the leader of the eminent elders in the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch, and his strength wasn’t something they could look down on. He was only second to Wangu Xu.

“As for the Mysterious Sparrow Creed, they have some relations with the Black and White Creed. The Mysterious Sparrow Patriarch, Zhugu Piao, is half a student of the Black and White Creed’s patriarch!”

As for Zhuge Piao’s son, he took on the eldest disciple of the Black and White Dao Venerable as his master!” Lei Yu explained.

There were a total of one hundred and sixty-two creeds in the Origin Heavenly Cave. The Black and White Creed is ranked number one among them, and the Black and White Dao Venerable was ranked seventh on the Extermination List!

Huang Xiaolong clasped his hands behind his back and laughed, “Wouldn’t that mean that the Black and White Creed wouldn’t sit by idly if I move against the Mysterious Sparrow Creed?”

The well-built old expert emitted black light from his eyes, and he took a step forward. “Your Highness, I’ll go retrieve the heads of both Liu Qiuan and Zhuge Piao.”

The old man was none other than the Myriad Formation Devil, ranked fourth on the Extermination List!

The old devil had never showed himself in the past, and even if he walked around in his true form, no one would recognize him. It was also the reason Jiang Meng, Feng Yuxuan, Chen Baili, and the others didn’t discover that the Myriad Formation Devil was Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate.

Even the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable didn’t know that the old man was the Myriad Formation Devil!

“Hold it right there. There’s no need for you to do that now.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “Let’s not draw attention to ourselves. We’ll deal with the Mystical Pavilion first.”

When Huang Xiaolong stopped the Myriad Formation Devil from ending the lives of both patriarchs, Wangu Xu received a report. A smile formed on his face as soon as he read it.

“Huang Xiaolong agreed?!” A figure beside him spoke.

“Lord San Song, Huang Xiaolong certainly did.”

San Song was the person behind baiting Huang Xiaolong over to the Mystical Pavilion, and Wangu Xu was only following his orders.

“Get everything ready!” San Song growled, “We cannot allow him to escape!”

“Lord San Song, you can rest assured. Even if Huang Xiaolong has the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable and Lei Yu to protect him, there is no way for them to save him!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Wangu Xu continued, “If he’s smart, he’ll hand over the Pure Soil obediently. Otherwise… Hehe…”
