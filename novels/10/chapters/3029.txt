Chapter 3030: Which Rock Did He Crawl Out From?

Lei Yu gulped as a gluttonous look appeared on his face. “Your Highness, this is exactly it!” It was clear that he was pining for the taste of the Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice.

Huang Xiaolong laughed when he saw the look on Lei Yu’s face. “Do they have a limit on how much one can buy?”

Nodding his head quickly, Lei Yu replied, “Of course not.”

“We’ll eat our fill later! We’ll finish their entire stock” Huang Xiaolong joked.

With his eyes sparkling in joy, Lei Yu grinned, “That’s what I was thinking of!”

A group of people emerged from the entrance of the restaurant and heard what Huang Xiaolong said to Lei Yu. The young man in the lead couldn’t help but sneer, “Which rock did they crawl out from? Are they delusional? Even if you have the money to buy up their entire stock, you will need to be able to consume them all! After three bowls, you will probably be too stuffed to move!”

The Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice wasn’t an ordinary type of spirit grain. They contained dense amounts of spiritual energy, and ordinary First Esteem Dao Venerables wouldn’t be able to digest more than a bowl! They would only be able to refine the energy contained in the bowl of rice after several days, and no one managed to eat more than three bowls of rice in the Heaven Seizing Inn. There were some who didn’t believe in the rumors, and he ate three bowls in a single go! In the end, he couldn’t move from his seat!

There were even instances of Primal Ancestors exploding from the excessive intake of energy!

Turning around to stare at the man who spoke, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu noticed that he was wearing the robes of the Nine Vision Creed. A sneer left Lei Yu’s lips.

“Brat, I’ll be able to eat thirty bowls of rice. Why don’t we make a bet? If I manage to finish it there won’t be a need for you to call me your granddaddy! Just kneel on the floor and bark like a dog. You can leave as long as everyone in the restaurant can hear you!”

The experts standing behind the young man raged instantly.

“How dare you!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Preposterous!”

Narrowing his eyes, the young man stared at Lei Yu for a second before turning to Huang Xiaolong. “Hand over your mount right now. I’ll teach him some manners! If you dare refuse…”

“What do you think you can do to me if I refuse?” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“If you refuse to do so, you’ll regret it!”

“If you fail to get out of my sight in ten seconds, you’ll be the one regretting it.” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Laughing in rage, the young man snorted, “What bullsh*t! How dare you threaten me?! Do you really think you can do anything to me if I refuse to leave?”

The experts in the Heaven Seizing Inn were disturbed by the commotion and they started turning their attention over.

“Is the beast crazy? How dare he offend the Nine Vision Creed? The young man talking to them should be a core disciple of the Nine Vision Creed, and he’s a grand elder of the faction! He should be a First Esteem Dao Venerable, and he is the direct disciple of Eminent Elder Wang Shou!”

Many people recognized the young man talking to Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing how many people recognized him, the young man, Yuan Lin, started to get cocky. He stared at Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu with an arrogant look on his face.

“Brat, I’ll give you one last chance to leave. Hand over your mount and I’ll allow you to live.”

Thinking that Huang Xiaolong was considering the possibility of handing Lei Yu over, Yuan Lin continued, “You better make your choice soon.”

“Ten seconds is up.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air. He turned to speak to the Old Monster Flame. “Break their legs and throw them out.”

The members of the Nine Vision Creed were stunned by the sudden change in situation.

Just as Yuan Lin was about to mock Huang Xiaolong, the Old Monster Flame moved. With a wave of his hand, the members of the Nine Vision Creed felt the space around them constricting. Feeling a sharp pain shooting up their legs, they were sent flying through the air in the next instant. When the others turned to look at Yuan Lin and the rest, they saw that their legs were shattered at different angles.

The experts in the Heaven Seizing Inn were shocked. They didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would do as he said!

Ignoring the weird looks all around him, Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the restaurant and found a seat. When Huang Xiaolong sat down, Lei Yu was the only one who dared to take the other seat. The Old Monster Flame and the others stood behind him respectfully.

Yuan Lin, whose right left was shattered beyond repair, grabbed his leg and screamed. It was obvious the Old Monster Flame didn’t simply break their bones if First Esteem Dao Venerables would be reduced to a screaming mess.

A trace of rage and embarrassment flashed through Yuan Lin’s eyes.

“I’ll let you act cockily for now!” Yuan Lin endured the pain as he brought the members of his Nine Vision Creed away.

As he left, killing intent filled his heart when he looked at Huang Xiaolong and the Old Monster Flame.

Noticing Yuan Lin who was leaving with the members of the Nine Vision Creed, Lei Yu sneered, “Your Highness, if you allowed me to handle it, I would have killed them all with a single slap!”

“There’s no need to rush things.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “When the auction ends, we’ll take a trip down to their headquarters.”

Asking for an attendant, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered with the Nine Vision Creed. He ordered a hundred bowls of Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice and several dozen dishes.

The dishes he ordered were naturally no ordinary dishes. They were made using grand dao herbs, and they were the best the restaurant had to offer! A single dish cost upwards of ten thousand dao coins, and ordinary Dao Venerables would never be able to afford spending like Huang Xiaolong did.

When the attendant heard Huang Xiaolong’s order, he couldn’t help but stare at the man in stunned silence. “Lords, are you sure you wish to place the order?”

Before he processed the words coming out of his mouth, Lei Yu slammed a spatial ring on the table. Acting like the mobster boss of a region, he roared, “His Highness and I will definitely finish your entire stock of Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice today! Bring me a hundred bowls to start! Prepare another hundred after we’re done!”

The attendant stared at Lei Yu with a look of disbelief. He wasn’t sure if he was hearing things, but when he swept his senses across the ring, retreated back into the kitchen quietly.

Dao coins were piled up high into several mountains in the spatial ring, and there had to be several tens of billions of them.

When the experts saw that Lei Yu was able to throw out several tens of billions without batting an eyelid, they started whispering among themselves. They became extremely curious about Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

Ordinary dao convergences wouldn’t be able to throw out an amount like that even when buying treasures!

Moreover, the two were merely splurging on a meal!

For dao convergences like the Blue Lotus Creed back in the Divine Tuo Holy World wouldn’t be able to take out ten billion dao coins!

Their food arrived almost instantly, and a hundred bowls of Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice was placed in front of them. When the dishes Huang Xiaolong ordered were brought to his table, the fragrance filled the entire restaurant.

Experts sitting all around felt their mouths watering when the fragrance assaulted their nostrils..

Holding a bowl of Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice, Huang Xiaolong saw that the grains were like pearls as wisps of true dragon flame swirled inside them. Moreover, it was as though every grain was the home of a miniature ice phoenix.

Putting a spoonful in his mouth, Huang Xiaolong felt the grains dissolving on his tongue the moment they made contact. Spiritual energy filled his body and he felt his pores opening. It was as though he was undergoing a baptism of ice and fire! The taste of the Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice was too fragrant to describe.

As he enjoyed the taste of the Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice and the other dishes on the table, Peng Fei and Jia Zhen ran into their own troubles. They stared at a group of Devil Curse Creed disciples opposite them.
