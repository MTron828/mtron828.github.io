Chapter 3387: Peaches of Immortality

 

Everyone was stunned when they looked at Yang Kai’s corpse.

Immortal Emperor Yang Kai, was killed just like that!

If Chen Keyu was the youngest and most talented Immortal King in the Dongsheng Continent, Yang Kai would be the youngest and most talented Immortal King in the five continents!

Their statuses couldn’t even be compared to each other!

Now, Huang Xiaolong killed both of them!

Chen Keyu’s death might enrage Zhao Qi, but Yang Kai’s death would cause the entire western region to break out into chaos!

When they thought about the monstrous presence of the Buddhist factions in the west, everyone found it hard to breathe.

Zhao Qi looked at Yang Kai’s corpse and laughed maniacally. “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you kill Brother Yang Kai?! You’re dead! No one will be able to save you!”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Reaching out, Huang Xiaolong grabbed Zhao Qi by the neck. “It’s not something you have to worry about. Right now, do you think anyone will be able to save you?” 

As he tightened his grip, Zhao Qi’s eyes started to bulge and a sense of fear he had never felt before in his life filled his mind. However, he roared with laughter in the next moment, “Huang Xiaolong, the Heavenly Court has a type of secret art that will allow me to rebuild my body and condense my divine spirit again! You will never be able to kill me!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “I’ll have to disappoint you. Those who are killed by me will never be able to come back to life.” 

Panicking, Zhao Qi tried to suppress the fear in his heart as he mocked, “Do you really think I’ll believe you?” 

Squeezing Zhao Qi until he exploded, Huang Xiaolong used a trace of flame to burn his body to ashes. “It doesn’t matter if you believe me. Anyway, I didn’t lie to you.” Of course, he didn’t. How could the special art of a lower world possibly reverse the death of someone Huang Xiaolong set out to kill?

As everyone in the hall turned to look at each other, they fell to their knees in fright.

Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them as he left the Heavenly Frost Palace with a single step.

When he finally left, everyone in the hall fell to their butts.

They looked at Yang Kai’s corpse and noticed that there wasn’t any blood flowing from the hole in his forehead. 

“Is the Immortal World about to go into battle again…?” Chen Tianxing, the founding ancestor of the Extreme Star Sect muttered to himself.

Since the Ancient Heavenly Court was exterminated, there had been peace for several tens of thousands of years.

Now that Zhao Qi and Yang Kai were killed, it seemed as though the Heavenly Court and the Western Buddhist factions would be stepping in.

The instant Huang Xiaolong returned to the Shushan Immortal Gate, the news of Yang Kai’s death started to spread. It was as though a rock was thrown into the peaceful waters of the Immortal World.

“Zhao… Zhao Qi was killed?!” Song Zhipeng jumped in fright when he heard the news.

“Yes, City Lord Song,” one of the attendants replied. “According to the accounts there, Yang Kai made a move on Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to stop him, and he was killed too!”

Song Qianqian stared at the attendant in a daze. It was as though her soul had left her body.

Song Zhipeng looked towards the skies with his thoughts in turmoil.

That was the first time an Immortal Emperor fell since the establishment of the new Heavenly Court.

Moreover, two of them were killed at the same time! One of them was a great general of the Heavenly Court, and another was a treasured disciple of the Western Buddhist factions.

Yang Kai wasn’t just the disciple of the Maitreya Buddhist Ancestor, but he was also one of the most important disciples they had! His position in the faction wasn’t low at all!

When Mu Shuihan and the others received the news, they stared at Huang Xiaolong with their mouths agape.

“Senior Huang…” Mu Shuihan felt the world spinning around him.

“Relax. With me around, nothing can hurt you guys. Even if the two super factions descended, they won’t be able to touch the Shushan Immortal Gate,” Huang Xiaolong reassured.

Bowing respectfully, Mu Shuihan sighed.

“Is there any news about the three other people?” 

“Not yet.” Mu Shuihan shook his head. “Should we contact them and ask them to hurry up?”

“There’s no need for that.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. Even though he wanted to discover their whereabouts, there were some things he couldn’t hurry no matter how hard he tried.

With the temptation of the great dao pill, Huang Xiaolong was sure they would do everything in their power to hasten the search.

Four days passed in a flash.

The thing that surprised the Immortal World was that the Heavenly Court and the Western Buddhist faction remained quiet during the time that passed. It was as though they didn’t care about the deaths of the two experts.

However, several Immortal Emperors who were well connected could feel the undercurrents surging. A terrifying hurricane was building up, and it would sweep through the five continents the moment it blew up. Many of them started to pass down orders to their disciples in order to keep them away from the storm.

When there was one day left until the deadline Huang Xiaolong set for the Holy Pavilion, the main pavilion master Wang Xinyang paid a personal visit to Huang Xiaolong.

The only person he brought with him was Du Guang.

They were there to report the whereabouts of the three ladies Huang Xiaolong was looking for.

“Oh? The Tortoise Spirit Goddess and Wudang Goddess are currently in the Goblin Mountain in the north?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. However, a frown soon formed on his face. “And you can’t find the Golden Spirit Goddess…”

The Goblin Mountain was the holy ground of the demonic races. Not even Immortal Emperors would dare to intrude on their territory.

Of course, that wouldn’t be a problem for Huang Xiaolong. If he wanted to go somewhere, nothing would be able to stop him as long as Pangu wasn’t the one who set up the restrictions. The only problem was the fact that they had no idea where the Golden Spirit Goddess was!

“The Queen Mother of the West would be holding a gathering in a month. It’s the Gathering of the Immortal Peaches, and almost every single expert would be present. The Golden Spirit Goddess appeared every time, and she will most likely turn up this time too,” Wang Xinyang replied respectfully.

“Oh.” A flash of light lit up Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Will all four of them be present for the gathering?”

Wang Xinyang bowed. “Yes. The Gathering of the Immortal Peaches is an important event in all three worlds. Everyone invited by the Queen Mother of the West will definitely show up! That’s not all. Even the emperors in the Heavenly Court and the Buddhas of the west will definitely show up! Holy Maiden Nuwa used to show up every time, but no one knows if she will come for sure.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly before asking Wang Xinyang several other questions.

Next, he handed the great dao pill over as payment for their services. When Wang Xinyang received the pill, he couldn’t help but kowtow towards Huang Xiaolong.

Before he left, he tried to warn Huang Xiaolong. “Senior Huang, I received news that the western factions and the Heavenly Court plan to join hands to deal with you at the gathering!”

“That is because the Emperor of the Heavenly Court and Buddha Rulai don't wish to see another war happening in the Immortal World. As such, they want to deal with you quickly in order to please the Queen Mother of the West!”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Wang Xinyang and muttered, “Alright.”

Bowing respectfully, Wang Xinyang took his leave. When he left the Shushan Immortal Gate, he felt his clothes drenched in a cold sweat. Even when he met the various experts in the other factions, he never felt as threatened.

“Queen Mother of the West? Gathering of the Immortal Peaches…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

Huang Xiaolong knew about the Queen Mother of the West. In the Pangu World, her legends were everywhere. Like Holy Maiden Nuwa, their statuses were known to be second only to Hong Jun! As such, even Buddha Rulai and the others would have to lower their heads when talking to her. As for the emperor of the Heavenly Court, he was considered a junior even to Buddha Rulai.
