Looking at Saint Mother Yao Chi’s cute expression, Huang Xiaolong laughed softly, “Didn’t I say everything will be alright? In the future, no one can hit you.”

Because they were standing quite close, Saint Mother Yao Chi distinctly felt Huang Xiaolong’s wide muscular chest and the faint body heat passing through his robe, causing her heartbeat inexplicably quicken. She lightly nodded her head, too shy to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Even though there were others present such as Cao Yang and Zhuang Xuan, there was a distinct atmosphere between Huang Xiaolong and Saint Mother Yao Chi that excluded everything else.

Unknowingly, Saint Mother Yao Chi’s breathing quickened audibly as her body temperature rose, her scent that drilled into Huang Xiaolong’s nose became clearer, adding another layer to her charming aura.

Watching her, Huang Xiaolong suddenly blurted out, “If you don’t believe what your disciple says next time, I will slap your butt.”

Saint Mother Yao Chi stiffened, then her face turned bright red all the way to her ears.

This was the first time Huang Xiaolong spoke so brazenly to her... Moreover, with other people present. The stranger thing was, not only did Saint Mother Yao Chi find that she wasn’t angered Huang Xiaolong’s behavior, there was actually a faint happiness.

Huang Xiaolong was aware that this wasn’t the time for the two of them to catch up or confess each other’s feelings, thus, pulling his attention back to the current situation, he looked at Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei.

In this short time, the thoughts of escape had crossed these three people’s minds more than once. Huang Xiaolong clearly saw that the three of them wanted to flee but were afraid of the Green Ice Hail Devil Bing Xingying.

“Huang, Huang Xiaolong, a misunderstanding, really, this is just a misunderstanding.” Cao Yang hurried to speak, forcing a smile on his face, “We really didn’t know this woman was your Master.”

“Weren’t you about to break my arms and legs, then slowly let my blood flow out?” Huang Xiaolong stolid tone continued, “Was that also a misunderstanding?”

Whatever Cao Yang wanted to say next was stuck in his throat like a fish bone.

“What do you want then?” Zhuang Xuan was impatient, his expression gloomy.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “I’ve already told you, I will break your five limbs before sucking your blood dry.”

Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei became slightly ashen. They didn’t care what Huang Xiaolong said earlier, even thinking his threat was naive and ludicrous. But now, none of them thought it was funny anymore.

Finished saying that, Huang Xiaolong’s fingers tightened around Cao Bishi’s neck, causing the sound of breaking bones to echo in the air.

“No, don’t—!” Cao Bishi’s eyes widened in fear, filled with despair as he made the last struggle as he tried to shout and beg, but he couldn’t make a sound.

With a turn of his wrist, Huang Xiaolong completely broke Cao Bishi’s neck before sending a sliver of supreme fire element godforce through his forehead, which came out from the back his head.

Cao Bishi tumbled sideways to the floor, his body devoured by the fire element godforce.

Watching the fire burn away Cao Bishi’s body, slowly disappearing, leaving behind nothing but gray ash, Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei could no longer disguise the fear in their eyes, turning a shade paler.

With death upon down on them, it became hard to breathe.

The Cao Family steward had already lost consciousness some time back.

“Huang Xiaolong, we are Grand Elders of the Barbarian God Sect! As a core disciple of the same sect, do you dare to kill us?” Cao Yang was furious yet afraid at the same time, “Even if the Ancestor and Sect Chief protect you, you won’t escape death!”

Although Huang Xiaolong was an outstanding talent, wanton acts of killing were not condoned.

If Huang Xiaolong really killed three of his sect’s Grand Elders, just as Cao Yang said, not even the Barbarian God Sect Ancestor and Sect Chief could protect him.

“That’s right.” Zhuang Xuan quickly added, “Huang Xiaolong, killing us brings no benefit to you, let’s end this matter here. Since this woman is your Master, we can let you two go.”

At this point, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t contain his laughter anymore.

“I’ll be frank with you, I have covered this entire hall with a secret technique, others won’t realize what is happening here.” Huang Xiaolong’s expression suddenly turned icy, “Even if I kill you all, no one will find out!”

Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei’s face tightened grimly. No wonder no Cao Family experts or guards rushed over after so long.

“Then again, so what if the Barbarian God Sect finds out I killed you three?” Huang Xiaolong sneered indifferently, “Even if the whole Barbarian God Sect becomes enemy, even if the entire Green Cloud Island becomes enemy, so what?”

Saint Mother Yao Chi’s heart trembled, gazing affectionately at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong ended the superfluous conversation with the three people and ordered the Bing Xingying to attack them.

Frigid green qi rushed into the hall from all around, targeting Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei. It was so cold that even their souls seemed like they were about to freeze.

The three Barbarian God Sect Grand Elders leaped back in terror.

No matter how far they retreated or how they desperately they dodged, that terrifying frigid green qi still struck them, entering their bodies. In a few breaths’ time, Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei’s blood froze, followed by their godheads, and lastly their flesh, causing them to be unable to move.

After Bing Xingying froze the three of them, she did not attack further.

Huang Xiaolong walked up to the three ice statues with a cold smile on his face. With a wave of his hand, the three people’s five limbs were cut off from their bodies.

Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei let out blood-curdling screams, unable to bear the sharp pain originating from their lower body.

A force from Huang Xiaolong’s palm pulled the three of them, and even Cao Munan, then his Archdevil Supreme Godhead began swallowing their blood essence and godforce.

Cao Yang and the others clearly felt their blood essence and godforce leaving them as their bodies rapidly shrunk.

Huang Xiaolong stopped moments later when the four were no longer breathing. Different from Zhao Chenyuan and Luo Hua, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on keeping them alive in a comatose state.

His family, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Saint Mother Yao Chi... all these people were his reverse scale, so Cao Yang’s group deserved to die!

There was still one person left. Huang Xiaolong approached the Cao Family’s young lord, Cao Jincheng.

At this point, Cao Jincheng finally understood fear. His legs gave out as he tried to back away, “Huang Xiaolong, if you kill me, your woman’s Heart Devil Blood Curse can never be undone!”

“Heart Devil Blood Curse?” Huang Xiaolong frowned, but his feet stopped.

Hearing Cao Jincheng regard her as Huang Xiaolong’s woman, a sweet shyness filled Saint Mother Yao Chi’s heart.

Cao Jincheng was anxious to convince Huang Xiaolong, “That’s right, to prevent her from running away, one month ago I used the Heart Devil Blood Curse to bind her. This is an ancient devil clan’s curse, without my antidote she’s absolutely dead!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Saint Mother Yao Chi.

Saint Mother Yao Chi nodded, “He indeed placed a curse on my body. At that time, he said that if I don’t get the antidote within one year, I’ll die from being gnawed by ten thousand venoms. In fact, I have to take his antidote every year.”

Huang Xiaolong turned back to Cao Jincheng hearing Saint Mother Yao Chi’s explanation, killing intent swirling in his eyes like an angry storm. All of a sudden, he punched out and Cao Jincheng’s torso exploded from the violent force. Huang Xiaolong then grabbed Cao Jincheng’s head and started scouring his memories.

A moment later, after going through his memories, Huang Xiaolong’s face seemed gloomier than ever.

From Cao Jincheng’s memories, he found out that there was actually no method to lift this Devil Heart Blood Curse once and for all. The so-called antidote could only temporarily suppress the backlash of the curse in Saint Mother Yao Chi’s body.

’How can this be?!’

“Huang Xiaolong, do you believe me now?” Cao Jincheng’s manic laughter rang in the hall, “Even if you kill me, your woman won’t live long either!”
