Everyone stared blankly into space when they heard He Jingyi’s sky high price of twenty million eight hundred thousand. When Huang Xiaolong’s bid of three million came out, everyone turned their head in unison to stare at him.

Thirty... Thirty million!

Everyone felt their heart tremble at the mention of that number.

“Alright. Our friend here bids thirty million. Are there any more bids?” Zhang Tianle yelled with excitement.

A brilliant smile could be seen on his face.

Thirty million low-grade chaos spirit stones!

The price had already crossed the goal the Dark Roc Family had set for the grandmist divine beast and from the looks of it, the price would definitely be going up.

He was right. As soon as the words left his lips, Shi Yinyu from the Nine Yin Corpse Giant Tribe yelled, “Thirty million one hundred thousand!” His bid was a clear provocation towards Huang Xiaolong.

Thirty million one hundred thousand!

Even the ancestors of the superpowers felt their heart palpitating.

In the number two private room, He Jingyi clenched her fist as a disappointed expression appeared on her face.

This time, she had used all her connections to gather thirty million low-grade chaos spirit stones. She wanted to use all of it to obtain this Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. It seemed as though she wouldn’t be able to buy it now.

Her gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong and a complicated look flashed through her eyes.

“Thirty million two hundred thousand.” Song Litao wasn’t willing to give up either.

“Thirty million three hundred thousand.” Without missing a beat, Huang Xiaolong raised the bid once again.

“Thirty million four hundred thousand.” Shi Yinyu’s voice sounded out the moment Huang Xiaolong made his bid.

Qin Huangzhong shook his head. According to him, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin was an extremely rare divine beast. However, it wasn’t worth it for him to bid more than thirty million low-grade chaos spirit stones on it.

When Shi Yinyu’s bid of thirty million four hundred thousand appeared, Song Litao’s expression became extremely ugly. Killing intent burst out from his eyes, and none of the experts behind him dared to make a sound.

“Thirty million six hundred thousand!” Song Litao practically yelled at the top of his lungs.

When Huang Xiaolong heard the desperation in his voice, a smirk appeared on his face. It seemed as though Song Litao had already reached his maximum bid. He didn’t hesitate to raise the price once again. “Forty million.”

Forty million!

Even Emperor Realm ancestors sucked in a cold breath when they heard the astronomical number. They nearly fell from their seats and even He Jingyi displayed an expression of shock. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Song Litao turned into a deflated balloon as he slumped back into his sofa.

Shi Yinyu’s face turned completely black as he glared at Huang Xiaolong.

“Brother Shi, do you need me to...” Peng Zhengfei asked.

“No.” Shi Yinyu shook his head and said, “There is no need. Even after he obtains the Scarlet Blood Dark Qilin, there is no way that brat can walk out of the Holy Mountain alive. After we kill him, the beast is going to be mine anyway. Even if this brat tries to subdue the beast, he wouldn’t be able to do it anytime soon. He’ll probably need tens of thousands of years to form a bond with the beast...”

Peng Zhengfei nodded his head in agreement.

“However, your Netherworld King’s Organization is really rich...” Shi Yinyu changed the topic and chuckled, “I’m actually a little envious of you.”

Peng Zhengfei laughed as well. “After you kill the kid and allow my master to take control of the Netherworld King’s Organization, what’s mine is naturally yours.”

“Great!” Shi Yinyu roared with laughter.

Since Song Litao and Shi Yinyu didn’t continue to fight for the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, it was sold to Huang Xiaolong for forty million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

Even though forty million low-grade chaos spirit stones was an unreachable amount for almost everyone present, it was a mere drop in the bucket compared to Huang Xiaolong’s wealth.

With a flick of his finger, a spatial ring appeared on the stage and exactly forty million low-grade chaos spirit stones were stored in it.

After they confirmed the payment, Huang Xiaolong gestured with his finger and kept the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin in his Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle.

Other spatial rings might be unable to house the massive grandmist divine beast, but the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle was a high-grade grandmist artifact. It was nothing to store a mere divine beast in it.

When Song Litao saw how easily Huang Xiaolong kept the qilin, a sinister light flashed through his eyes. A frosty expression appeared on his face as he said, “This brat seems to have a lot of treasures on him...”

Lu Tianyuan, an ancestor of the Massacring Gods Gate, laughed. “Indeed. The treasures this brat possesses seems to be exceptional.”

Song Litao chuckled. “That’s right.”

“In that case, we shall auction ten cauldron of Unfettered Demon Extermination Pills. Even though they are peak-grade grandmist spiritual pills, they formed their own demonic soul when the pill was formed. The medicinal effect of the pill dropped significantly, and the starting price will be lowered accordingly. The price of a single cauldron will start at a hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones. The price of ten cauldrons would be a million.”

Even though the price started off at a million low-grade chaos spirit stones, the competition wasn’t as intense as before.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain all ten cauldrons at three million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

The last item of the auction was the high-grade grandmist artifact, the Demonic Gourd. When it was brought onto the stage, it was merely the size of a fist. It seemed to be leopard printed on the surface but when one looked closer, they would be able to see that those were extremely thin marks.

A high-grade grandmist artifact was a priceless treasure, and no one in their right mind would sell one away. However, this Demonic Gourd was flawed, and the price wasn’t too high. In the end, it started off at five million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

Of course, the price was relative. Even though five million was considered low, it was an astronomical amount in the eyes of everyone present.

Compared to the cauldrons of pills before, way more people took part in the auction of this artifact. Despite that, Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain the item after spending fifteen million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain all three treasures at the auction, everyone looked at him with a weird gaze.

In total, Huang Xiaolong spent fifty million eight hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones.

Fifty million eight hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones. Even massive superpowers didn’t dare to dream of taking out that amount of money. Even superpowers at the level of the Misty Palace wouldn’t be able to gather that much!

Under the gazes of everyone present, Huang Xiaolong left the auction venue with Tai Yue and the rest. When he arrived at the entrance, Huang Xiaolong puffed his chest out and sighed. “My luck isn’t bad today.” Without a pause, all of them flew towards the Heaven Dome Manor.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong disappearing into the distance, Song Litao’s gaze turned frosty. “Get people to guard the entrance of Nirvana City!”

“Young Master, please rest assured. That brat won’t be able to run away.”

In under an hour, Huang Xiaolong arrived back at the manor.

After entering, Huang Xiaolong urged Tai Yue and the others to set up defensive restrictions around the residence. After adding layers upon layers of security, Huang Xiaolong brough the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin out from the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle.

It was time for him to subdue the grandmist divine beast!
