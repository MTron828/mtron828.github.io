Chapter 1474: The Apprenticeship Ceremony

Looking at the pile of 431,250 top-grade-nine spirit stones on the floor, Sun Shihai’s laughter choked in his throat. So did Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu, and the others’ laughter.

Fu Feiyu was flabbergasted as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. During the rankings competition, he had found out that Huang Xiaolong had one million top-grade-nine spirit stones, but he thought that Huang Xiaolong was simply bluffing and had not expected Huang Xiaolong to be so willing to take out almost half of that to buy twenty-three pieces of low-grade grandmist velocity stones!

Huang Xiaolong flicked his fingers, sending twenty top grade-nine spirit stones towards the supervisory disciple as he said, “These twenty top grade-nine spirit stones are your reward.”

Twenty top grade-nine spirit stones!

The supervisory disciple was beyond delighted in his heart, and beamingly thanked Huang Xiaolong, “Many thanks Martial Uncle!” He swiftly took out the twenty-three low-grade grandmist velocity stones and offered them to Huang Xiaolong with both hands.

That posture was seemingly more respectful than the one he had used towards Sun Shihai... Was it?

A gloomy light glimmered in Sun Shihai’s eyes as he said, “Huang Xiaolong, it seems Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei really dotes on you.” In other words, Sun Shihai was claiming that Huang Xiaolong’s top grade-nine spirit stones were given by Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind Sun Shihai’s words at all, in truth, he ignored Sun Shihai as he did most of the time. He asked the supervisory disciple, “Are there any true dragon’s wings here in the Myriad Treasure Palace?”

The true dragon’s wings were also one of the essential materials required to repair his Dragon Shark Flying Ship.

However, the true dragon’s wings were rarer than the low-grade grandmist velocity stones. So in truth, Huang Xiaolong was only asking about this item with very little hope, not expecting the Myriad Treasure Palace to have it.

But who knew the supervisory disciple actually answered positively, “Martial Uncle wants to buy true dragon’s wings? It’s really a coincidence, as our Hall Master happened to obtain two pairs of true dragon’s wings recently, however, these two pairs of true dragon’s wings are much more expensive than the low-grade grandmist velocity stones.”

Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong was delighted, despite the last part of the supervisory disciple’s sentence. ‘There really are true dragon’s wings! Two pairs, even better!’

“How much?” Huang Xiaolong asked, sounding a little urgent.

The supervisory disciple swiftly replied, “If Martial Uncle is paying with top-grade-nine spirit stones, then one pair of true dragon’s wings would cost 2.4 million.”

2.4 million top grade-nine spirit stones!

Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu, Zhou Wen, and the others’ shuddered hearing that figure.

2.4 million top-grade-nine spirit stones were equivalent to over three hundred million low-grade-eight spirit stones in exchange rate!

More than three hundred million!

One of the disciples in Sun Shihai’s group could even feel his knees going soft.

“I want both pairs of true dragon’s wings!” Right at this point, Huang Xiaolong’s voice sounded. Then, he flickered his fingers and numerous spirit stones rained down once more from the air. The whole inner hall was shaking with the impact.

All of them were top-grade-nine spirit stones!

As these top-grade-nine spirit stones accumulated in the inner hall, rich spiritual energy flooded outwards to the outer hall.

Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu, and others in the inner hall nearly choked themselves due to the sudden abundance of spiritual energy.

“4.8 million top grade-nine spirit stones.” Huang Xiaolong stated, then asked the supervisory disciple, “Where are the two pairs of true dragon’s wings?”

But the supervisory disciple continued to stare stupidly at the great pile of 4.8 million top-grade-nine spirit stones, seemingly unable to hear Huang Xiaolong’s question at all.

Helpless, Huang Xiaolong could only ask a second time.

The supervisory disciple came to his senses in a shudder. Suppressing the astonishment in his heart, he respectfully answered Huang Xiaolong, “Martial Uncle, please come with me.” After saying this, he led Huang Xiaolong towards the several grids at the end of the inner hall.

Within one of these grid spaces there was a dragon-patterned spatial ring.

The inside of this dragon-patterned spatial ring was filled with various dragon clan related treasures. For example, dragon crystals, dragon pearls, dragon’s heart, dragon’s tail, dragon’s eyeball, Dragon Emperor Blood Jade, and similarly precious treasures.

The two pairs of true dragon’s wings were placed somewhere close to the center of the spatial ring among these other treasures.

The true dragon’s wings were several thousand meters long. The wings’ surfaces were dense with the dragon clan’s unique blood symbols and veins. When the supervisory disciple took out the two pairs of true dragon’s wings, dragon qi rushed out towards Huang Xiaolong and the whole inner hall.

Looking at the two pairs of the true dragon’s wings in front of him, Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath to calm the roiling dragon qi inside his body. Even his Holy Dragon Supreme Godhead seemed to have started spinning a little faster.

Huang Xiaolong collected the two pairs of true dragon’s wings and put them away. With a casual wave of his hand, fifty top grade-nine spirit stones fell in front of the supervisory disciple.

The supervisory disciple asked excitedly, “Martial Uncle, this is...?”

“Your reward.” Huang Xiaolong answered with a smile.

“Many thanks, Martial Uncle!” The supervisory disciple was grinning from ear to ear.

With this recent purchase by Huang Xiaolong, Sun Shihai once again witnessed him taking out a large sum of 4.8 million top grade-nine spirit stones to buy the two pairs of true dragon’s wings, and great waves of shock hit his heart.

Zhao Lei is actually spoiling his newly accepted personal disciple to this degree!

The 4.8 million and the 431,250 top grade-nine spirit stones from earlier—that’s more than ‘5 million top grade-nine spirit stones!’

“Let’s go!” Sun Shihai suddenly felt extremely annoyed by Huang Xiaolong, and snapped at Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu, and others as he turned and left.

Initially, Sun Shihai had planned to look around the Myriad Treasure Palace to see if there were any other interesting treasures, but now, he had lost the mood.

After stepping out from the inner hall, Sun Shihai left the Myriad Treasure Palace directly without even stopping in the outer hall.

Following closely behind Sun Shihai, Liu Qin cautiously persuaded, “Martial Uncle Sun need not mind it too much, as Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance is based on some allowance from his Master, Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei. He’s just showing off like a narrow-minded villain. In a month’s time, during the apprenticeship ceremony, your name will resound like thunder in numerous Emperor Palaces when everyone witnesses Martial Uncle Sun conquering everyone with your true strength!”

Sun Shihai’s mood improved slightly at Liu Qin’s words.

On the other hand, after Sun Shihai and his group left, Huang Xiaolong bought a lot more good stuff. It was almost two hours later when he left the Myriad Treasure Palace’s inner hall.

After leaving the Myriad Treasure Palace, Huang Xiaolong went back to the Tiger Dragon Palace Gardens and took out all the good things he had bought.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sparkled brightly as he looked at the dozens of Buddha Pastes resembling golden Buddha statues.

These dozens of Buddha Pastes were one of the good things he had bought from the Myriad Treasure Palace’s inner hall earlier.

Moreover, these Buddha Pastes were not God King Realm grade but Heavenly Monarch’s Buddha Pastes!

When he was at the Royal Buddha Great Worlds’ auction, the competition for the God King’s Buddha Pastes was fierce enough, but the Myriad Treasure Palace actually had Buddha Pastes refined from Heavenly Monarch Realm masters!

Even though these were only low-level Heavenly Monarch’s Buddha Pastes, they were many times better than God King’s Buddha Pastes.

Huang Xiaolong was beaming as he put the Buddha Pastes away. He was in no hurry to refine them right now as he planned to wait until he reached the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm to break through to the God King Realm once and for all.

Huang Xiaolong summoned his three avatars and formed a four-colored spiritual energy gathering formation as he entered cultivation and continued refining Fortune Divine Fruits.

In the blink of an eye, the month passed by.

Huang Xiaolong stopped cultivating and stepped out from his room on the day of the apprenticeship ceremony. Just as he stepped out, he saw Senior Brother Chen Hao walking in from outside and chided to him with a smile, “You’re finally willing to come out ah. If you would have still stayed inside, I would have needed to break in and drag you out.” He paused slightly before continuing, “Come on, let’s head to the Fortune Great Hall, Master’s already waiting for us there.”
