Chapter 358: Dragon Blood Crystal

Huang Xiaolong was stunned at the sudden emergence of the undead bone dragon. He didn’t expect merely the city gates to contain an undead bone dragon guardian.

While everyone was still shocked and confused, the peak late-Tenth Order Saint realm undead bone dragon’s claw extended, stepping down towards Huang Xiaolong at unimaginable speed. If Huang Xiaolong was stepped on, as strong as his physical defense was, he would still turn in a flat meat paste.

“Young Lord!” Zhao Shu was terrified, without hesitation he struck his palm at the undead bone dragon, but it was evident that Zhao Shu was a step too late. The undead bone dragon’s claw was right above Huang Xiaolong.

Watching as Huang Xiaolong was about to be turned into meat paste, a blinding light flashed and Huang Xiaolong disappeared from the spot.

Space concealment!

A loud boom resounded when the undead bone dragon’s claw slammed into the ground where Huang Xiaolong stood earlier. Violent tremors shook the ground, raising a curtain of sand and dust.

A long buzzing noise drummed in everyone’s ears.

Almost at the same time, Zhao Shu’s attack landed on the bone dragon’s leg and another ‘boom’ rang out. The bone dragon was knocked back a dozen meters, then steadied itself.

Yet it was enough to cause Duan Ren to inhale sharply, for Zhao Shu’s powerful attack did nothing but knock the bone dragon back. It wasn’t injured in the least!

Huang Xiaolong reappeared on the side, staring at the bone dragon with a tiny frown on his brows. They couldn’t be delayed here, when he opened the black hole space entrance just now, that strong dragon might aura must have attracted the attention of closeby experts, there would definitely be quite a number of experts following behind them. Therefore, he had to step into Dragon City before anyone else arrived.

What to do?! Forced entry was out of the question.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone as he searches for a method, it seems there was no other choice but to use the Godly Mt. Xumi!

Just when Zhao Shu, Duan Ren, and the others wanted to attack the bone dragon together, an aureate light flashed, blinding their eyes. Opening them again, they found themselves inside a spacious hall.

Zhao Shu and Feng Yang already entered the Godly Mt. Xumi before, thus they weren’t surprised at the sudden change of environment, but Duan Ren’s group of three were alarmed and baffled.

“This is..?!” Duan Ren asked in shock.

Huang Xiaolong did not answer, shrinking the Godly Mt. Xumi to the size of a speck of dust and floated with the wind, very quickly passing through the bone dragon, entering Dragon City.

Duan Ren watched as they passed right under the bone dragon without receiving any attack from it, his heart quickened. What is this? To be able to escape the detection of a peak late- Tenth Order Saint realm bone dragon?! To Duan Ren, this was an impossible feat to begin with.

While the three were wallowing in bewilderment, Huang Xiaolong brought everyone into the Dragon City. In the air space above the Dragon City, a blinding light flashed again, everyone was out of the spacious hall and Huang Xiaolong returned the Godly Mt. Xumi into his body.

“Young Noble Huang, just now, that...?” Unable to restrain the gnawing curiosity in his heart, Duan Ren asked aloud.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, saying, “Brother Duan Ren, it’s better we focus on searching for the Dragon Clan’s treasures.”

Duan Ren was taken aback at the rejection, then he understood Huang Xiaolong’s underlying meaning.

At this time, Zhao Shu looked at Duan Ren and the other two Saint realm experts with a dignified expression, “The matter just now, I hope the three of you will keep it to yourselves, don’t mention it to anyone.” Although the three of them were unable to link the place just now to Godly Mt. Xumi, it didn’t mean that they couldn’t in the future. Zhao Shu didn’t want the matter about Huang Xiaolong possessing the Godly Mt. Xumi to be leaked out.

At the very least, not at this time!

The God Binding Ring, Absolute Soul Pearl, and Linglong Treasure Pagoda couldn’t be compared to the Godly Mt. Xumi. If Huang Xiaolong possessing the Godly Mt. Xumi was leaked out, it would bring a horde of endless troubles.

Seeing Zhao Shu’s grave expression, Duan Ren and the rest nodded solemnly, “Mister Zhao, rest assured, we will not breathe a word out about what happened earlier.”

Zhao Shu nodded.

“Let’s go, we must find the Dragon Clan’s treasures as fast as possible!” Huang Xiaolong said and flew off. This was the most crucial of all. Huang Xiaolong believed that Duan Ren wouldn’t say anything about what happened, that was one of the reasons he used the Godly Mt. Xumi without much deliberation.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Duan Ren, and the rest passed through the Dragon City gates, Chen Tianqi’s group of Asura’s Gate experts arrived in front of the city gates. Just like what happened to Huang Xiaolong’s group, when Chen Tianqi and his subordinates were about to pass through the gates, the same peak-late-Tenth Order Sain realm undead bone dragon blocked their path.

Huang Xiaolong possessed the Godly Mt. Xumi, allowing him to pass through the gates undetected, but Chen Tianqi’s group wasn’t so lucky. One of the Asura’s Gate Domain Leaders was pierced by the bone dragon’s giant tail when he was too slow in dodging, right through his chest, and then flung away by the bone dragon.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s group was flying at high speed across the Dragon City, trying sense any unique energy fluctuations of the Dragon Clan’s treasures, however, ever since they entered the Ancient Dragon Clan’s ruins, the black and blue dragon martial spirits in Huang Xiaolong’s body quieted once more, as if they were suppressed by something.

More than an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group had yet to have any harvest.

The Dragon City was several times bigger than the Ghost City, even with Huang Xiaolong’s group’s speed, they still needed a few days to cover every corner of the city. Such method of blind searching was no different than trying to find a needle in the vast sea. Not only that, there was the increasing pressure of more and more experts entering the city as time went on, breaking past the undead bone dragon’s defenses.

One hour later, Huang Xiaolong stopped, suggesting in a grave voice, “It’s better if everyone split up and search.” That way, chances of finding something was greater.

“Agreed.” Duan Ren nodded, no objection.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and giant ghost Feng Yang went in one group, while Duan Ren grouped with the other two Duanren Institute Honorable Saint Masters, and separated. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Still, another hour passed without any harvest. Huang Xiaolong’s group of three split once again, each to rely on their own luck.

Not long after separating from Zhao Shu and Feng Yang, Huang Xiaolong stopped above a palace building. This building was triangle-shaped, reaching up to a hundred zhang tall, with a large area at the ground, close to several thousand square feet. It was much larger compared to the other buildings that Huang Xiaolong had seen so far in the Dragon City.

Looking at this particular building, Huang Xiaolong landed on the main entrance below in a flicker. Despite the twin dragons inside his body being quiet, Huang Xiaolong had previously refined an Earth Dragon egg, thus he was quite familiar with the dragon aura, as long as he was within a certain distance, he could sense it.

This triangular building had that same aura, and it was very strong!

The problem was, the door was tightly shut.

He checked the door using the Eye of Hell, and after confirming that there were no traps placed on the door, Huang Xiaolong struck the door open and entered. The moment Huang Xiaolong entered the hall, a powerful dragon aura washed over him, yet it was different from the Earth Dragon egg that Huang Xiaolong had previously refined.

‘This is?!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened, greatly astounded looking at the four crystal pillars in the hall.

Numerous pieces of blood-red rubies in different sizes formed jutting out on the surface of these four pillars, some small, others big. The small ones were about the size of a fist, whereas the larges ones reached half a meter wide.

“Dragon Blood Crystals?!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed.

When Dragon experts cultivated by breathing in dragon qi, under years of accumulation, the place where they sat would give birth to these Dragon Blood Crystals, containing a Dragon expert’s true essence and dragon qi. It was a true treasure for cultivators! Although a piece of Dragon Blood Crystal couldn’t be compared to a dragon egg, the number of Dragon Blood Crystals stuck on these four pillars was probably close to a thousand!

Close to a thousand pieces of Dragon Blood Crystals!
