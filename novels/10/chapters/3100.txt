Chapter 3101: My Disciple Would Like To Exchange Pointers With You

As the experts standing all around saw Wangu Xu appear with a group of experts, they rejoiced. They had been waiting for Huang Xiaolong to clash with the Mystical Pavilion, and they wanted to fish for benefits during the battle.

Wangu Xu and his army of experts soon arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

Just as everyone thought that they would attack Huang Xiaolong the moment they arrived, Wangu Xu revealed a brilliant smile on his face and he cupped his fists towards Huang Xiaolong. “You must be Young Master Huang! I didn’t think that Young Master Huang would arrive so quickly, and I failed to give you a proper welcome at the city gates! I hope Young Master Huang will forgive my lack of hospitality!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled in response. “Branch Pavilion Master Wangu is too kind.”

Wangu Xu soon greeted the other members in Huang Xiaolong’s party.

“I’ve heard of Daoist Brother Lei Yu’s great name, and it’s an honor to meet you.” Wangu Xu’s gaze landed on Lei Yu and he spoke.

“The younger generation will always surpass the old.” Lei Yu snickered. “Your talent is higher than mine, but it’s too bad you chose the wrong side to stand on. Wangu Xu, if you agree to be His Highness’ subordinate, you will be a lot better off than you are now.”

Everyone stared at Lei Yu in silence. No one thought that he would speak so disrespectfully the moment they met.

Those from the Mystical Pavilion received Wangu Xu’s order previously, and they knew that they shouldn’t antagonize Huang Xiaolong’s group until they succeeded. However, they couldn’t contain their rage when they heard what Lei Yu said. If looks could kill, Lei Yu would have died several times over.

After all, Lei Yu was implying that the Mystical Pavilion was a piece of garbage weaker than Huang Xiaolong! He was insulting the Main Pavilion Master of the Mystical Pavilion!

A chilly light flashed in Wangu Xu’s eyes, and the smile on his face disappeared. He glared at Lei Yu and said, “Does this mean that Daoist Brother Lei Yu managed to choose the correct side?” It was clear he was skeptical about the power supporting Huang Xiaolong.

Roaring with laughter, Lei Yu scoffed. “No sh*t! I’ve received everything I wanted by following His Highness! Even genesis level pills can be eaten like candy!”

Everyone stared at him in shock.

Eating genesis level pills like candy?!

Wangu Xu turned to look at Huang Xiaolong and the smile on his face reappeared. “Young Master Huang is really rich. You’re so generous to a slave!”

The Myriad Formation Devil felt a trace of irritation rising in his heart when he heard what Wangu Xu said. After all, wasn’t he insulting all of them by saying that?

As soon as the killing intent appeared in the old devil’s heart, Wangu Xu felt his hairs standing on end. He was shocked and he turned to look at the old devil. Before he could feel anything off, the old devil regained his calm and Wangu Xu failed to discover anything.

Coughing dryly, Wangu Xu thought that his mind was playing tricks on him.

Another expert behind Wangu Xu couldn’t contain his anger and he lashed out at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, how dare…”

“Shut up!” Wangu Xu frowned and interrupted him.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle lightly when he looked at Wangu Xu again. “Branch Pavilion Master Wangu, I wonder which slave of yours dares to speak out of turn?”

The expert behind Wangu Xu felt his face going green and anger took over his head.

Wangu Xu didn’t bother with the insult, and he laughed it off. “I was planning to introduce the experts of my branch to Young Master Huang! This is vice branch master, Pang Rui!”

“Oh.”

When Pang Rui saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t interested in him at all, his expression sank. He tried his best to control the anger in his heart, but he chose to remain silent in the end.

After introducing more than a dozen experts to Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong learned that all of them were important people in the Mystical Pavilion. They were experts in their own right, and they were no weaker than any of the patriarchs of the top twenty creeds in the Origin Heavenly Cave. All of them wouldn’t appear in the outside world unless something serious happened, and their presence obviously indicated that something was about to go down.

“Young Master Huang, I wonder which one of your slaves tried challenging us previously. Why don’t you introduce him to us?” He was clearly interested in the Myriad Formation Devil.

As soon as he spoke, everyone turned to look at the old devil.

Wangu Xu’s special attention to the old devil was something that shocked those present.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to reveal his hand so early on in the show. “His name is He Zhen, and he’s someone who tried to ambush me on my way back from the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce. He wanted my Pure Soil, but I defeated him and he chose to submit to me.”

He Zhen was the real name of the Myriad Formation Devil, but not many people knew about it.

Everyone knew the terrifying reputation of the Myriad Formation Devil, but his name was a mystery. As such, Huang Xiaolong didn’t think twice before telling those from the Mystical Pavilion.

Indeed, Wangu Xu chuckled like a fool when he heard the name. “As it turns out, Little Brother He Zhen is pretty formidable.” It was clear he was no longer guarded against the old devil.

He felt that He Zhen was probably suppressed by Lei Yu when he tried to ambush Huang Xiaolong in the past. Since He Zhen wasn’t a match for Lei Yu, he wouldn’t need to be afraid of the man either. After all, even someone like Lei Yu wouldn’t be able to escape once their grand formation was activated.

Huang Xiaolong nearly burst out laughing when he heard how Wangu Xu addressed the old devil. He managed to control himself and he only smiled lightly at the other party.

Instead, the Myriad Formation Devil formed a sinister prank in his mind. With a cheeky smile appearing on his otherwise expressionless face, he asked, “I’ve long since heard of Branch Pavilion Master Wangu. I wonder if I can exchange pointers with you?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

A sneer formed on Pang Rui’s face when he heard the question. “You’re just a mere slave who serves Huang Xiaolong. How dare you challenge the branch master?” A disciple stepped up before anyone else could speak and Pang Rui continued, “This is my disciple, Tang Fei. If you wish to exchange pointers, you can do so with my disciple during the banquet tonight.”

Lei Yu lost all control of his lips and he howled with laughter.

Pang Rui, Wangu Xu, and the others couldn’t help but frown when they heard Lei Yu’s laughter.

Unexpectedly, the Myriad Formation Devil didn’t say anything in response. He turned to stare at Pang Rui as a flash of cold light crossed his eyes.

Gesturing for Huang Xiaolong to enter the main hall, the disciple of the Mystical Pavilion formed a long line as they yelled, “We welcome Young Master Huang!” Their voices shook the skies as the entire city heard their greeting.

Even if there weren't a billion disciples present, there were at least a million. All of them were experts of the younger generation, and their collective aura was terrifying. The experts who were present in the city trembled in their shoes when they felt it.

As the disciples ‘respectfully’ welcomed Huang Xiaolong, the expressions on their faces showed that they were anything but respectful to him.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle under his breath. “Pavilion Master Wangu really went all out this time! However, the disciples of your Mystical Pavilion are really too weak.” How could he not understand that Wangu Xu was displaying his strength in order to knock Huang Xiaolong down a peg? However, Huang Xiaolong alone had the power to crush everyone present, including San Song! Why would he be afraid of them?

If there were a million Dao Venerables, Huang Xiaolong might actually be a little on guard. However, the number of Dao Venerables was far too lacking.

Wangu Xu was stunned, but he quickly forced a smile. “Of course, they cannot compare to peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables like Young Master Huang.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hide his strength, and everyone could see that he was a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable. Wangu Xu’s sarcasm was clear to all, and according to the man, Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than an ant despite his cultivation realm.
