Chapter 3058: Golden Flames Sandy Land

And it was because they had heard of Lei Yu’s feats that these experts were shocked.

Lei Yu’s notorious reputation had cemented him as a ruthless character, and it was said the dozens of Heavenly Cave Lords around the Heavens Burial Lands detoured whenever they saw Lei Yu.

One could imagine how notorious Lei Yu’s reputation was.

Seemingly, these experts’ gazes were too intense that Lei Yu couldn’t ignore them at all. His head turned towards them, and he grinned, revealing glistening white fangs, yet looking like a simpleton. These newly rescued experts’ faces turned deathly pale. In the past, whoever Lei Yu had found displeasing to his eye was directly swallowed into his belly. The worst was not being swallowed into the belly, but thoroughly chewed before being swallowed down.

“Little guys, you all seem to be very afraid of me?” Lei Yu looked displeased.

This dozen of experts were so scared that they quickly shook their heads as if their lives depended on it.

“Alright, we should leave now,” Huang Xiaolong spoke. The treasures in this treasury space had long been cleared out by Mou Baicheng’s expedition group, and there was nothing valuable to be found here. Therefore, after rescuing Chen Ming and those trapped inside there, Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, Old Monster Flame, and the rest left the space.

When Huang Xiaolong spoke, Lei Yu stopped teasing those frightened creeds’ disciples.

After leaving the treasury space, Huang Xiaolong did not make things difficult for those experts rescued together with Chen Ming. He merely left a restriction mark in their bodies to ensure that they would not disclose what had happened today.

But Xiaoan pulled down his face and refused to leave, declaring that he would be following Lei Yu from now on.

Lei Yu was troubled and looked inquiringly at Huang Xiaolong.

“Let him follow then,” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, agreeing to Xiaonan joining their group.

“Thank you, Your Highness!” Xiaoan was overjoyed and thanked Huang Xiaolong.

“What is your full name?” Huang Xiaolong asked, smiling slightly.

“Replying to Your Highness, my full name is Li Xiaoan,” he quickly replied.

Li Xiaoan? Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “This name was given by your master?”

“Indeed, Your Highness!” Li Xiaoan smiled wryly, “My master is obsessed with the sword, and has his own skills with the sword. The only thing is, he’s quite sloppy when it comes to giving names.”

Lei Yu agreed sonorously, “This kid’s right, Ten Swords that old man is sloppy in everything except the sword. He’s called Li Xiaoan, and his junior brother is called Zhang Xiaodi, and both names were given by old man Ten Swords.”

Li Xiaoan looked embarrassed.

Huang Xiaolong merely chuckled.

“Master, where are we going now?” Chen Ming asked Lei Yu.

Lei Yu did not conceal their plans, “We’re going to the Golden Flames Sandy Land,” and briefly summarized the events in the Heavens Burial Lands from the last few months to his disciple.

Chen Ming, and Li Xiaoan had been trapped inside the treasury space for many years. Naturally, they had no idea so many things had happened in the Heavens Burial Lands in recent months. Both were genuinely shocked as they listened to Lei Yu’s brief recount.

It was a smooth journey to the Golden Flames Sandy Land.

A few days later, Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Golden Flames Sandy Land.

In the golden sandy land on the horizon, sand and dust cast a hazy skyline, and there were flames flowing out from the ground. Before Huang Xiaolong’s group entered, they could feel the hot waves rolling towards them.

“The Golden Flames Sandy Land’s flames have grown more volatile!” Chen Ming looked at the flowing flames on the ground and exclaimed in shock. He was certain the flames flowing in the Golden Flames Sandy Land were not so violent.

“Perhaps it’s related to the recent changes in the Heavens Burial Lands?” Lei Yu’s brows furrowed deeply upon seeing this.

Huang Xiaolong scanned the surroundings with his dao souls and found that the Golden Flames Sandy Land’s space was extremely unstable, and the cause of flowing flames' volatility seemed to originate from a certain kind of energy at the depths of these golden sand?

But it did not stop Huang Xiaolong’s group from venturing into the Golden Flames Sandy Land.

Although the environment within the Golden Flames Sandy Land had become more volatile and dangerous, it posed no problem for Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Huang Xiaolong saw many experts from other forces as he ventured deeper into the Golden Flames Sandy Land. It was probably because these experts had heard that the Prince of Origin had gained a harvest here, the opportunity of comprehending the power of absolute blaze drew them here.

The further in they got, the more volatile the golden flames coming off the ground became. Though the flames were violent in the beginning, there were quick bursts, and they were intermittent, but as they went further in, the flames resembled golden dragons that dominated the sky.

The lethality of these flames had gone beyond the level where average low-level Dao Venerable Realm experts could withstand.

Even early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables like Chen Ming and Li Xiaoan didn’t dare to be careless, and protected themselves with cosmos energy.

“The Golden Fox Dao Venerable has also entered the Golden Flames Sandy Land!”

“The Absolute Dao Lord, and Wild Maple Lord have also entered the Golden Flames Sandy Land!”

Not long after Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the Golden Flames Sandy Land, they heard news of the Golden Fox Dao Venerable and Wind Cloud Venerable, and other experts’ arrival. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Hey, Jin Hongyuan that kid’s also here.” Lei Yu chuckled when he heard the news.

Chen Ming struggled inwardly for sometime and finally squeezed out, “Master, the Golden Fox Lord, he…”

“I already know the gist of things,” Lei Yu cut him off as he knew his eldest disciple was referring to Jin Hongyuan allying with the Nine Vision Creed and Devil Blade Creed to bully the Leiyu Creed.

“Before we enter the Heavens Burial Lands, I ground down the Nine Vision Creed Patriarch,” said Lei Yu.

Both Chen Ming and Li Xiaoan were stunned.

“We also wiped out the Golden Fox Army of several million experts stationed close to the Nine Vision Creed, that Liu Yu exploded to his death with one flick of His Highness’ fingers,” Lei Yu added.

……

Somewhere in the deepest part of Golden Flames Sandy Land…

Several thousand experts were glaring angrily at the group of Mystical Pavilion’s experts.

“This Golden Flames Sady Land does not belong to the Mystical Pavilion, you guys barricaded this area and stopped us from entering this area. Aren’t you being too overbearing?!” a creed’s patriarch was indignant.

The Mystical Pavilion’s senior supervisor sneered, “Overbearing? so what? It’s not the Ancient Eternal Creed’s place to comment on how our Mystical Pavilion does things. If you have the ability, you can rush inside, but don’t say I didn’t remind you beforehand that anyone who crosses this line will die!”

He slashed out with the great blade in his hand, drawing a deep line across the ground that felt like a wall.

Faces in the crowd turned unsightly.

The Ancient Eternal Creed Patriarch hesitated. However, he did not have the guts to break past the barricade.

The Ancient Eternal Creed was one of the more powerful creeds in the Heavenly Caves surrounding the Heavens Burial Lands that rivaled forces such as the Golden Fox Creed and Panhu Creed. But facing a hegemon like the Mystical Pavilion, the Ancient Eternal Creed Patriarch chose to retreat and swallow in the unfairness.

Many creeds’ experts turned to leave, with the Mystical Pavilion dominating this sea, regardless how unsatisfied they were because they could only give up.

Not to mention, the Golden Flames Sandy Land was a vast place, even if there was a peerless treasure being born, it might not appear in this area, so it might be better if they tried their luck elsewhere.

Xue Yong snorted with disdain watching the experts endure and leave, “A bunch of ants dare to compete with the Mystical Pavilion.”

“Lord Xue Yong, is a peerless treasure really going to appear in this area?” a Mystical Pavilion expert asked.

“Don’t ask things you shouldn’t.” Xue Yong’s eyes were sharp as blades falling on them, sending chills down their hearts.

Xue Yong looked away, gazing into the depths of the area they were at. There, the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor, Three Blades Yang, Purple Giant, and Special Envoy Hailan sat cross-legged, each guarding one direction, north, south, east, and west, as they waited for something to be born.
