After a night of cultivation, when morning arrived, Huang Xiaolong exited the Xumi Temple with an obvious feeling that his strength had been enhanced by a large margin.

The purity level of godforce energy within a rank six godhead greatly surpassed Huang Xiaolong’s expectation. However, just as he stepped out from his courtyard, he was dragged away by Shi Xiaofei to go shopping.

Powerless against Shi Xiaofei, Huang Xiaolong resigned himself to accompany her around the city. The Alchemist Grandmaster Competition had just ended and he should take the chance to relax a little. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

What was the main purpose of spending the biggest portion of one’s life in cultivation? Wasn’t just so they could be alive and well, to live better days? Limiting oneself to nothing else but cultivation, that kind of life was too dull and uninteresting.

Being dragged around by Shi Xiaofei, they spent the entire day in the city, only returning to Chen Ye’s residence at dusk.

When Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei returned, Chen Ye had already prepared a banquet, merely waiting for the two of them.

Other than Chen Ye, the association Elders were also there, as well as the Royal Pill City’s super forces’ Ancestors and Patriarchs. A number of first rank forces’ Ancestors and Patriarchs also attended.

Huang Xiaolong was this term’s Pill King, the Ascending Moon Old Man’s personal disciple, and on top of this, he was also an Alchemist Grandmaster Association Elder, no wonder these Ancestors and Patriarchs needed to come over to congratulate and ‘connect’ with Huang Xiaolong.

As to not disrespect these Ancestor and Patriarch level characters’ kindness, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei joined the banquet.

Of course, when there was a banquet, the Ascending Moon Old Man couldn’t be far away. He was sitting on the main host seat, then came Chen Ye, and the association Elders. Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were seated close to the guests.

After some mingling and exchange of words, waves of laughter began to fill the hall as the guests enjoyed themselves. The banquet lasted well past midnight before everyone gradually bid farewell and dispersed.

Whereas Huang Xiaolong went inside the Godly Mt. Xumi, continuing to refine the rank six godhead and the Buddha śarīra.

The night passed, welcoming another bright sunny day.

Coming out from his yard, he couldn’t help breathing a sigh of relief seeing that Shi Xiaofei wasn’t there waiting for him. After accompanying Shi Xiaofei for the entire day yesterday, even with his stamina and strength, he couldn’t help shuddering at the thought of it.

Huang Xiaolong took his time, sauntering toward the Ascending Moon Old Man’s courtyard.

Despite triumphing over Xiang Mingzhi in the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition, Huang Xiaolong felt an increasing pressure from Xiang Mingzhi.

Because of the Azure Dragon Divine Fire!

He didn’t know the true power of the Azure Dragon Divine Fire, but the scene where all other fires and flames weakened significantly during the alchemy competition when Xiang Mingzhi summoned his Azure Dragon Divine Fire had left a deep impression in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Looking for the Ascending Moon Old Man today was to understand this Azure Dragon Divine Fire in detail.

“Kid, you’re here. Sit.” It was as if the Ascending Moon Old Man already predicted that Huang Xiaolong would come over. He was already sitting in the yard waiting for Huang Xiaolong. On the garden’s stone table were two jugs of Royal Pill Wine and two wine bowls.

The day before, the Ascending Moon Old Man ushered Huang Xiaolong and the Alchemist Grandmaster Association Elders to Royal Pill House as a celebration for Huang Xiaolong winning the Pill King title. Before leaving, all of them also ‘brought’ a jug with them and all of it was given to the Ascending Moon Old Man. Thus, inside old man’s spatial ring was a nice small stock of Royal Pill Wine.

Huang Xiaolong sat down on a stone chair.

“You want to ask about the Azure Dragon Divine Fire, right?” the Ascending Moon Old Man spoke first after Huang Xiaolong sat down.

Huang Xiaolong was dazed, then nodded his head.

The Ascending Moon Old Man said seriously, “Possessing the Azure Dragon Divine Fire, that Xiang Mingzhi kid will be your archenemy in the future, you must absolutely be careful of this Xiang Mingzhi!”

A chill streaked past Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

Something that could make the Ascending Moon Old Man look this somber, the Azure Dragon Divine Fire’s power was much, much stronger than Huang Xiaolong assumed.

The Ascending Moon Old Man knew the extent of Huang Xiaolong’s strength and talent, yet the old man still spoke with such a heavy expression, reminding Huang Xiaolong that he must absolutely be careful against Xiang Mingzhi. It was evident that the Azure Dragon Divine Fire was not as simple as what he explained before—just a slightly stronger fire.

The Ascending Moon Old Man went on in a somber tone, “Legend has it that whoever obtains the Azure Dragon Divine Fire would be able to absorb the star force in the Azure Dragon Galaxy at all times. Using the Azure Dragon star force to temper their body and cultivate, it would increase their cultivation speed so much that no one would be able to compare with them. Moreover, after integrating with the Azure Dragon Divine Fire, all cultivation bottlenecks would be non-existent. Meaning to say, others may be stuck at peak late-Seventh Order God Realm for years and see no hope of breakthrough; ten years, even several hundred years to have a possibility of advancing to Eighth Order. But Xiang Mingzhi can directly breakthrough to the Eighth Order!”

“Directly breakthrough to Eighth Order?!” Huang Xiaolong sucked in a sharp breath of cold air. This was a little too scary. Even the current him couldn’t do it.

“That’s right.” The Ascending Moon Old Man nodded in affirmation, “Furthermore, he can smoothly breakthrough all the way to the Highgod Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong was once again stunned. Meaning to say, Xiang Mingzhi could cultivate and breakthrough all the way to peak late-Tenth Order God Realm, entering the perfection stage, then onward to Highgod Realm?!

Others that were considered as monstrous geniuses could be stuck at peak late-Tenth Order God Realm or the perfection stage for countless years, but Xiang Mingzhi wouldn’t have to experience these situations?!

The Ascending Moon Old Man continued, “There is more. After integrating with the Azure Dragon Divine Fire, the fire protects its master. Now, even a perfection stage peak late-Tenth Order God Realm master would be hard pressed to kill Xiang Mingzhi. When Xiang Mingzhi’s cultivation will rise to Tenth Order God Realm, average First Order Highgod Realm masters also won’t be able to kill him easily.”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank deeper.

“Still, you need not feel discouraged,” the Ascending Moon Old Man’s tone suddenly changed, breathing out lightly as he said, “Based on your talent and current strength, you may not be weaker than him. Not to mention that your True Dragon Physique is able to evolve continuously, therefore, even if that little brat has the Azure Dragon Divine Fire, his cultivation speed wouldn’t be that much faster than yours!”

Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation speed was already faster than any average First Order Highgod Realm master’s, even the Ascending Moon Old Man couldn’t stop praising it. By no means was the old man touting Huang Xiaolong, he really did believe that Xiang Mingzhi’s cultivation speed would not necessarily be faster than Huang Xiaolong’s even with the Azure Dragon Divine Fire.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly, he understood most his own cultivation progress, especially after he started practicing the Treasure Dragon Protective Shield Art, his True Dragon Physique had evolved to a monstrous degree.

“Only that, in the coming Highgod Advancement Tournament, it would be difficult for you to win the first place if Xiang Mingzhi is participating.” The Ascending Moon Old Man pondered solemnly, “Unless...” His words stopped.

“Unless what?” Huang Xiaolong urged.

“Unless you can obtain the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, White Tiger Divine Fire, and the Vermillion Bird Divine Fire!” The old man was convinced of his thought: “As long as you can obtain any of one of these divine fires, adding your freak of a True Dragon Physique, only then would you be able to break past Xiang Mingzhi’s Azure Dragon Divine Fire!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly, “Old man, it’s easy for you to say, but how can it be so easy to obtain these three divine fires? Black Tortoise, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird; there is no clue at all about any of these three divine fires, how would I find them? Even if I can find them, not anyone can integrate with them, right? What if a backlash happens? I’ll be so dead that even a dust-sized particle wouldn’t remain of me!”

But the Ascending Moon Old Man widened his eyes in anger, fuming at Huang Xiaolong, “Even Xiang Mingzhi that kid can get the Azure Dragon Divine Fire and can integrate with it, why couldn’t you? Also, since the Azure Dragon Divine Fire has appeared, I believe the Black Tortoise, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires will appear as well! If you can integrate all three divine fires, forget Xiang Mingzhi, even that Qin Yi won’t be able to retaliate even if you use your pinky to fight him!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head wryly at the old man’s enthusiasm. What ‘integrate with all three divine fires’. Being able to locate even one and integrate with it was already considered lucky!
