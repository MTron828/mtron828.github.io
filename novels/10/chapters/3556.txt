Chapter 3557 – Natural?

If Tao Shi and Qian Shaolin were unable to resist the mere shockwave from the revelation of Huang Xiaolong’s power, there was no need to mention the others. They were on their knees as all the air was knocked out from their lungs. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Run!” Someone among them yelled all of a sudden.

He was the God of Creation who wanted to stop Huang Xiaolong when he destroyed Feng Tianquan’s physical body earlier. However, he barely turned around when he saw more than a dozen people appearing in the skies around them.

All of them were experts from the Creation Palace and the Hundred Empire Alliance!

“Zhu Yaowen!”

“Yang Gang!”

“Wang Zaixu!”

Tao Shi and the others felt something clicking in their mind. “Did all of you…”

“That’s right! His Highness has already accepted us into his service!” Zhu Yaowen smiled.

When Huang Xiaolong captured all of them, he laid down the Star Dragon Brand in their dao souls. Other than Kai Dong who was a half step Universe God and had higher resistance, all of them were already his servants!

There were seventy Gods of Creation standing around Huang Xiaolong, and a large portion of them were in the grand completion stage! There were even two at the peak of the grand completion stage!

Tao Shi and the others felt despair clouding their hearts when they saw the luxurious lineup.

“You can choose to submit, or I can destroy your physical body like Feng Tianquan!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice boomed in their ears.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you betray the alliance leaders! We won’t submit!” Someone screamed in anger.

Waving his hand casually, the Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared and beams of starlight struck the expert who spoke. Tao Shi, Qian Shaolin, and the others saw him flying through the air before landing on the ground as a puddle of blood.

“Star Dragon Divine Tree!” Tao Shi gasped.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong muttered before releasing a light barrier to trap everyone around him.

By the time they reacted, the entire region was covered in starlight. It was as though they had been transported to another world.

Tao Shi tried to release his dao souls, but they were forcefully suppressed.

“In my Star Dragon Space, not even half step Universe Gods will be able to escape in a short amount of time.” Huang Xiaolong took a step towards Tao Shi. “As for people like you… You won’t be able to break through the barrier even if I gave you an eternity.”

…

In one of the cultivation caves in the Unknown Space, Kun Feng, Xuan Hong, and the experts of the Creation Palace finally blasted away the final layer of restrictions. As it turned out, the cave was left behind by an expert at the half step Universe God realm! There were countless treasures within, and there were even five high-level universe spiritual veins! The experts of the Creation Palace nearly jumped in joy from their discovery.

However, Kun Feng and Xuan Hong found it hard to celebrate.

Countless days had passed, and Kai Dong failed to contact them.

“I’m afraid something happened to second brother…” Xuan Hong’s expression was solemn as he growled, “The last thing he said was that they ran into a trap laid down by the Eternal Heaven Alliance!”

Kun Feng gnashed his teeth and he swore, “We’ll make a trip over to the Eternal Heaven Alliance and ask them ourselves! Get someone to look into Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong’s whereabouts! I’ll go there right now!”

“If they refuse to hand second brother over…”

“We’ll kill them all!”

Several moments later, the experts of the Creation Palace charged out of the cultivation cave together.

As for Huang Xiaolong and the others, they arrived at one of the mountain ranges in the Unknown Space.

“Alright. Let’s do it here.” Huang Xiaolong declared.

He decided to refine Ao Wanshan’s Huang Long Bloodline as soon as he could. He would try to comprehend the cosmos sphere at the same time as he tried fusing both treasures to form the Universe Sphere!

As long as that happened, he would be able to locate the Universe Boat.

Laying down countless formations around him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless. They were in the most mysterious place in the thirteen universes, and Huang Xiaolong only stopped after laying down dozens of formations.

Ao Shenhai and the others were sent to guard the area.

Since Tao Shi and the others had already submitted to Huang Xiaolong, his ‘army’ increased to over two hundred Gods of Creation! With their combined strength, they wouldn’t be afraid of three half step Universe Gods even if they came knocking!

Huang Xiaolong hovered in the air above the mountain range and he released Ao Wanshan. Turning into the Star Dragon Divine Tree, countless roots pierced the man’s body! He started to devour Ao Wanshan’s bloodline and grand cosmos energy.

“Huang Xiaolong, I won’t let you off even in death!” Ao Wanshan screamed frantically.

Regardless of how hard he struggled, he was devoured by Huang Xiaolong till nothing was left.

When he was done, Huang Xiaolong sealed Ao Wanshan’s dao soul in the depths of the Sun Moon Furnace. Retrieving the cosmos sphere, he started to comprehend the mysteries of the universe contained within.

Just like that, millions of years passed.

When he was finally done, the two spheres fused to form a giant orb. The Universe Orb hovered before Huang Xiaolong and emitted dazzling rays of light. The runes that lined the orb were like tiny little veins. When they lit up, Huang Xiaolong felt as though the universe was palpitating. The Universe Orb seemed to possess a life of its own.

Huang Xiaolong tried to locate the Universe Boat with the Universe Orb, and a ray of light shot towards the depths of the Unknown Space.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.

Was the Universe Boat in the depths of the Unknown Space?

Without bothering upgrading the Purple Lightning Peak, Huang Xiaolong charged in the direction of the light.

“Your Highness!” Wang Meiqi and the rest welcomed him the moment he emerged.

“Release the formations! We’re leaving!” Huang Xiaolong didn’t say too much as he charged in a specific direction. The entire group followed quickly behind.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong’s group ran into hordes of beast waves. However, he personally dealt with them in order to save some time.

Several months later, Huang Xiaolong realized that they were still extremely far away from their destination.

Even after half a year of flying, they didn’t reach the depths of the Unknown Space.

The restrictions were growing stronger and stronger, and they formed a giant screen that had terrifying suppressive powers. Not even Huang Xiaolong could pass through easily.

After a year, Huang Xiaolong had no choice but to stop.

The consumption of grand cosmos energy grew too large even for Huang Xiaolong.

With a light flashing in his eyes, Huang Xiaolong looked towards the depths of the Unknown Space. After devouring Ao Wanshan, he broke through the 12 billion units mark. Even so, he was unable to approach the depths of the Unknown Space! How terrifying were the secrets contained within?!

Could the creation of the universe be attributed to some supreme behind hiding in the Unknown Space?!
