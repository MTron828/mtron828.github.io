Chapter 2890: One Kick is Enough!

Yang Jia and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong gleefully when they heard what Xuanyuan Potian said.

Now, they wanted to see if Huang Xiaolong would accept his fate! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

If he refused, he would offend the entire Xuanyuan Creed!

If he kneeled, he would be humiliating himself in front of the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World!

If that were to happen, they would never agree to take him as a dao partner!

Not to mention the fact that Xuanyuan Potian wouldn’t let Huang Xiaolong off so easily even if the latter agreed to kneel.

Just as the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World were about to open their mouths to speak for him, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred. When he reappeared, he was standing right before Xuanyuan Potian! His speed was something those present could hardly see!

“Your Highness, danger!” The mid-level Dao Venerable of the Xuanyuan Creed yelled the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong move, but it was too late.

Boom!

Raising his leg, Huang Xiaolong sent a kick straight into Xuanyuan Potian’s gut.

As a shriek of pain left his lips, Xuanyuan Potian was sent flying off like a bullet out of a gun barrel.

By silently circulating the leftover nirvana energy flowing through his body, Huang Xiaolong stared at Xuanyuan Potian’s miserable figure. That was right, he had used his nirvana energy to pierce straight into Xuanyuan Potian’s body, bypassing all his defenses.

After flying for god knew how long, Xuanyuan Potian slammed heavily into one of the continents floating around in space. He tumbled for several more miles, and he only stopped when he crashed into the mountain ranges in the distance.

“What?!”

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

They couldn’t contain the shock they felt after seeing what had happened.

They were shocked at the fact that Xuanyuan Potian was sent flying with a single kick. However, the feeling was nothing compared to the horrific discovery that Huang Xiaolong had dared to move against Xuanyuan Potain! Of course, the way he sent the Lightning Tiger Prince flying with a single kick was also surprising. One had to know that Xuanyuan Potian was one of the two tigers of the Divine Tuo Holy World! He was considered the peak of all geniuses in the younger generation, and he was only second to the Son of Creation, Huang Shuai!

As a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable, he had ten high-order Saint Fates!

Someone at his level was sent flying with a single kick from Huang Xiaolong!

The three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World were equally flabbergasted, and their pretty little jaws dropped in fright.

From what they recalled, the Lightning Tiger Prince was like the sun in the skies. His strength and reputation were unparalleled, and he had been domineering ever since his ascent. There were countless experts ready to move at his beck and call, and no one had ever dared to go against his wishes. He had never been disrespected, much less sent flying with a single kick!

“Your Highness!” The experts from the Xuanyuan Creed were scared out of their minds as they reacted instantly.

In a state of panic, they flew towards Xuanyuan Potian.

As the young patriarch of the Xuanyuan Creed, he was the only son of the Xuanyuan Dao Venerable! He was also the person their Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm ancestor doted on the most. If anything were to happen to him, they would all be punished!

As for Yang Jia and the rest, they stared at Huang Xiaolong blankly. They had no idea how to react. Where in the world would they find someone in the Divine Tuo Holy World who had the guts to send Xuanyuan Potian flying with a single kick?

Their worldview was single-handedly flipped around by Huang Xiaolong.

Whatever the case, they failed to remain in their state of shock as Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at all of them.

Previously, they had mocked him as though he was the lowest of the dregs when Xuanyuan Potian had arrived. How would their mockery escape Huang Xiaolong’s ears?

Their expressions changed the instant Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at them.

“Brother Huang…” Yang Jia was about to defend himself when Huang Xiaolong sent him flying with another kick.

Unlike Xuanyuan Potian, Huang Xiaolong kicked him directly in the face, and the imprint of a shoe could be seen on his face as he shot through the air like a cannonball.

If the Lightning Tiger Prince was unable to dodge Huang Xiaolong’s attack, there was no need to speak for people like Yang Jia and the others. One by one, Xu Xiaofeng, Han Tong, and those, who were laughing at him, turned into clairvoyants as they managed to see the future. They realized what was going to happen to them after Yang Jia was sent flying.

With a burning sensation on the right side of their faces, they felt a frightening strand of energy shooting into their bodies without the slightest bit of resistance. The energy was extremely cold, and it pierced straight into their dao souls. They experienced unspeakable pain as the nirvana energy ravaged them from the inside.

Crying out for their mothers, they drew beautiful arcs through the skies.

Without exception, those who had mocked Huang Xiaolong were sent flying.

Those who watched the scene play out, couldn’t help but feel a chill run down their spines.

Like Yang Jia, everyone, who were dealt with, were the key disciples of their factions! They might not have been super-geniuses, but their reputation in the Divine Tuo Holy World was nothing to scoff at!

They were treated as exalted beings wherever they went, but all of them were crushed by Huang Xiaolong’s unstoppable might!

Those who weren’t sent flying stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, and it was especially so for the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Silence descended on the lands.

One of the peak First Esteem Dao Venerables, who was hiding in the void around them, sneered, “Huang Xiaolong is basically sentencing himself to death. Hahaha, he didn’t just offend Xuanyuan Potian! He basically offended every power in the Dragon Fish Creed. No matter how talented he is, he’s doomed! No one will be able to save him now…”

“Even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables wouldn’t dare to stand out for him!”

After the battle, Huang Xiaolong’s reputation was sure to rock the foundations of the Divine Tuo Holy World, but without enough power, he wouldn’t be able to protect himself.

With his talent, he would have no problems getting a master at the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. However, he had offended too many powers from the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave! No superpower would dare to take a troublemaker like him in! After all, they wouldn’t be able to stand against the combined might of so many Creeds.

As soon as the words left the lips of the First Esteem Dao Venerable, Huang Xiaolong’s punch tore through the void towards him. He felt as though he was struck by a bolt of lightning as he was punched out from his hiding spot. His armor shattered as blood sprayed out from his mouth.

The other Dao Venerables, who were hiding in the void around the battlefield, felt their hearts stop for a moment. They felt that their concealment was perfect and Huang Xiaolong would never be able to discover them. However, his previous punch proved them wrong.

As their bodies started to tremble in fear, they were afraid that Huang Xiaolong would move against them the moment they irritated him.

By the time the First Esteem Dao Venerable was blown away, the members of the Xuanyuan Creed had arrived beside Xuanyuan Potian. They saw a stream of golden blood leaking from his lips.

Huang Xiaolong’s kick might not have been strong enough to send him flying out of the region, but it was too damn strong! He had even used the power of nirvana!

As the experts tried to stabilize his condition using their cosmos energy, they discovered that it was completely useless!

“What’s going on?! How can this be?!” The Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable gasped in shock.

“What power did you use?! What did you do to His Highness?!” He glared at Huang Xiaolong with killing intent bursting out of his eyes.

“Today, you will no longer be able to live! I’ll kill you no matter what it takes!”

He turned into a bolt of lightning as he charged at Huang Xiaolong.
