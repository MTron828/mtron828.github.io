Chapter 439: Back To The Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce Headquarters

“Big brother Huang, that Shao Dongjiang, we...?” After coming out from the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce headquarters, Shi Xiaofei couldn’t resist saying.

“Don’t worry, he won’t live past tomorrow!” Huang Xiaolong already knew what Shi Xiaofei wanted to say, and reassured her. “Let’s leave Birchleaf City for now.”

Shi Xiaofei nodded at Huang Xiaolong’s suggestion, she understood the reason why Huang Xiaolong wanted to leave Birchleaf City, it was to lure the other side to come after them.

Hence, the four of them did not linger in the city, exiting Birchleaf City without so much as another glance backwards.

When Shao Dongjian received the message that Huang Xiaolong’s group had gone out of the city, a beaming smile emerged on his face, “I didn’t expect this little brat to be in such a hurry to die.” He had thought that Huang Xiaolong might stay inside Birchlead City for a few days, he didn’t imagine that their group would exit the city immediately after leaving the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce.

Zhu Wuji laughed sordidly as he said, “I shall wish Brother Shao to obtain double happiness, both women and spirit pellets!”

Shao Dongjian liked what he heard very much, “Many thanks, the other women were a little lacking but they’re still rare beauties. This trip to Birchleaf City, I have truly reaped a bountiful harvest!” With that, his figure flickered into a blur, vanishing from the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce headquarters.

Leaving the commerce chamber building, Shao Dongjian exited the city and flew off at breakneck speed toward the direction Huang Xiaolong’s group departed in.

It didn’t take him long to catch up to Huang Xiaolong’s group of four.

Spotting them, Shao Dongjian sped up and floated elegantly, landing right in front of Huang Xiaolong’s group with his hands clasped behind his back, using his back to face Huang Xiaolong, emulating the style of a great expert.

“Little punk, leaving so fast?”Shao Dongjian chuckled with undisguised malicious intent as he slowly turned around, looking at Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei.

But, just as his words left his mouth, out of nowhere a surge of powerful ghost aura engulfed Shao Dongjian from all directions, accompanied by endless ghost howls.

Shao Dongjian was startled, watching a pack of evil spirits tearing toward him.

‘What the f*ck is happening?!’ Then a possibility flashed in Shao Dongjian’s mind. ‘This, an array formation?!’

Quickly gathering his battle qi, Shao Dongjian’s hands struck forward, sending out multiple dark green palm imprints, piercing through the air, blasting all the evil spirits that came howling at him into smoke.

“Little punk, I didn’t expect you to carry some spirit tool that could arrange an instant array formation!” Shao Dongjian’s laughter grew pernicious, “All the better, after killing you, this array spirit tool shall belong to me!”His ten fingers bent into claws, slashing at Huang Xiaolong.

Dark green claw imprints pierced through space, reaching Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye.

Before Shao Dongjian’s attack struck, dense ghost aura sprung forth around Huang Xiaolong, transforming into countless evil spirits that blocked Shao Dongjian’s attack. At the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette disappeared into the array formation.

Standing outside the array formation, Huang Xiaolong watched Shao Dongjian being besieged by countless evil spirits with frigid eyes.

This period of time, the Supreme Ghost Flag had swallowed a large number of Saint realm experts’ souls, turning them into evil spirits inside the flag, greatly enhancing its strength. The ghost aura emitted could turn into evil spirits that possessed the strength equivalent to First Order Saint realm.

Although those First Order Saint realm ghosts couldn’t possibly kill Shao Dongjian, who was a Tenth Order Saint realm expert, it was enough to trap him down for some time.

Huang Xiaolong already included in his calculation that Shao Dongjian would rush after them, and prepared the Supreme Ghost Flag in advance.

“You punk, you’d better let me out this instant, otherwise, when I destroy this array formation, don’t even dream of begging for a quick death!” From inside the array, Shao Dongjian’s shout reverberated as his hand slammed down, once again shattering another batch of ghosts that flew toward him.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. With a slight hand wave, numerous Poison Corpse Scarabs flew into the array formation, straight at Shao Dongjian.

Huang Xiaolong quietly dared this Shao Dongjian to pull out a Divine Dragon Armor.

Inside the array formation, Shao Dongjian had just scattered a batch of ghost and prepared to search for the formation eye so he could break out from the array when countless black insects came flying at him. Reacting on reflex, Shao Dongjian struck his palm out. He assumed that the black insects were also creatures created by the array formation and didn’t think much about it.

In the next second, he noticed that after being hit by the power of his palm, those black insects remained unharmed other than staggering back some distance, swiftly flying toward him again.

Shao Dongjian frowned, striking out both palms at the incoming insects a second time, even increasing the power of his attack to a fourth of his strength, but to his horror, those black insects still remained intact!

“This, impossible!” He was shocked. What in damnation were these things?!

Not even a Fourth Order Saint realm demonic beast could withstand a strike from his palm, that strike just now would be enough to shatter its bones and blast a huge hole in its flesh, rearranging the beast’s internal organs. Yet, these little black insects were actually unharmed!

Then a thought struck his mind; ‘Could it be?!’

“Poison Corpse Scarabs!” There was a tiny tremor in Shao Dongjian’s voice.

It could only be those infamous Poison Corpse Scarabs that could withstand a fourth of his attack power.

“That’s right, Poison Corpse Scarabs!” At this precise moment, Huang Xiaolong’s bone-chilling voice sounded from outside the array formation.

Initially, Shao Dongjian was wishfully hoping that he guessed wrongly, but Huang Xiaolong’s words totally shattered the last shred of hope he had.

“You’re Huang Xiaolong!” Shao Dongjian struck out both palms, barely avoiding the latest wave of attack from the swarm of Poison Corpse Scarabs, one could trace the hint of fear in his voice.

Huang Xiaolong!

Asura’s Gate Sovereign!

Finally, fear crept up Shao Dongjian’s face. Never would he have imagined that he would be provoking this fiend.

On the outside, Huang Xiaolong did not speak again, coldly watching the situation inside.

“So this Brother is Asura’s Gate Sovereign.” In an abrupt turn, Shao Dongjian changed his tone, laughed as he expressed goodwill, “There were some misunderstandings earlier, I hope Brother can overlook the matter. As the saying goes, an exchange of blows may lead to friendship. If Brother is still interested in the four stalks of Dragon God Grass, take it as a gift from me.”

No reply came from Huang Xiaolong, however, the attacks from the Poison Corpse Scarabs intensified.

Compared to the time of the Asura Square battle, the current Poison Corpse Scarabs, in terms of speed, defense, and attack, far exceeded their previous state. Huang Xiaolong believed that Shao Dongjian wouldn’t be able to endure much longer.

At that time in the Asura Square, Li Molin and the other Deities Templar Elders held godly weapons and wore Divine Dragon Armors, yet still failed and ran with their tails between their legs at the end, forget a mere Shao Dongjian.

Sure enough, just like Huang Xiaolong predicted, Shao Dongjian was having a hard time trying to avoid being bitten and dodging the Poison Corpse Scarabs that attacked from everywhere, he was nearly bitten by them a few times. The goodwill he showed to Huang Xiaolong earlier were quickly replaced by mouthful of foul curses. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Little mongrel, kill me and the Distinct Void Door would find out in no time, the Distinct Void Door won’t let you go!”

“Quickly let me out!” Shao Dongjian shouted at the top of his lungs.

Huang Xiaolong remained silent, ignoring him.

A short while later, without any suspense, Shao Dongjian that was trapped inside the Sea of Devils and Ghosts Array became nourishment for the Poison Corpse Scarabs, slowly biting and gnawing their way through his flesh. Struggle, fear, pain, agony, and his screams made all three women watching ashen.

Although all three women felt that Shao Dongjian deserved to die, they couldn’t help feeling that the method was too cruel, to the point of being gruesome.

After the Poison Corpse Scarabs did their work on Shao Dongjian, Huang Xiaolong used the Supreme Ghost Flag to swallow his soul, turning him into an evil ghost, and then recalled all the Poison Corpse Scarabs.

Huang Xiaolong opened Shao Dongjian’s spatial ring. The inside was filled with gold coins, spirit pellets, elixirs, and quite a number of grade one spirit stones. As the Deputy Sovereign of Distinct Void Door, his wealth was not something an average Deities Templar Elder like Yao Fei could compare to.

Among a pile of herbs and elixirs, Huang Xiaolong found the four stalks of Dragon God Grass.

Finally, he got the four stalks of Dragon God Grass!

“Big brother Huang, are we going to the Asura’s Gate headquarters next?” Shi Xiaofei asked.

“No,” Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “Back to Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce!”

At this time, inside the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce headquarters inner hall, Zhu Wuji was sipping tea while waiting for Shao Dongjian’s return.
