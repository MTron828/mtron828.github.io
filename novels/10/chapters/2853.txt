Chapter 2854: I’m Interested to See Long Jianfei

The Blue Lotus Creed Patriarch Lin Rui was smiling as he spoke to Zhu Hui, “Brother Zhu Hui, it’s rare for you to come here, so you must stay a few more days. Not to mention that I’ve especially prepared Phoenix Nectar!”

Zhu Hui’s eyes lit up as he exclaimed in pleasant surprise, “Phoenix Nectar!”

Phoenix Nectar was a rare kind of spiritual liquid in the Divine Tuo Holy World, a delight that was comparable to grand dao treasures. It was the saliva of the first generation phoenix from the time of creation, mixed with natural spiritual water for countless millions of years.

This nectar was useful even to Dao Venerable Realm experts’ cultivation, and not to mention that the nectar tasted quite good. Then again, one couldn’t even find such a treasure from auction houses, and on a rare occasion or two that the Phoenix Nectar appeared in an auction, the price would reach the exorbitant price. Even creed lords might not be able to afford it.

Lin Rui’s smile widened when he saw Zhou Hui’s reaction, “That’s right! It’s the Phoenix Nectar, that I had found in a secret land many years back, and there are two small bottles. It’s rare for Brother Zhu Hui to visit me, so wait for me to take it out and we can taste it together.”

Zhu Hui laughed delightedly, “In that case, I won’t be polite!”

“It should be like that.” Lin Rui’s sonorous laughter echoed.

After a brief pause, Lin Rui continued in a nonchalant manner, “I’ve heard that the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch would promote the Son of Creation, His Highness Huang Shuai, as young patriarch after he enters Dao Venerable Realm, and he would inherit the Dragon Fish Creed, is it?”

Zhu Hui nodded, “This is no secret, and the Creed Patriarch indeed has this intention. However, based on His Highness Huang Shuai’s identity, merely inheriting the Dragon Fish Creed won’t be fair for His Highness.”

After hearing that, Lin Rui was shocked, “Brother Zhu Xui means, could it be…?”

“Yes, the Divination Creed Patriarch, Red Fox Creed Patriarch, Moon Wolf Creed Patriarch, and six other creeds have long acknowledged His Highness Huang Shuai as the young patriarch. Once His Highness Huang Shuai breaks through to Dao Venerable Realm, he would lead all ten creeds and unify the Divine Tuo Holy World!” Zhu Hui nodded as he smiled a knowing smile.

When the Son of Creation Huang Shuai were to break through to Dao Venerable Realm, the ten great creeds were going to jointly announce this news. Hence Zhu Hui frankly revealed this piece of information to Lin Rui.

“What?!” Lin Rui could not contain his shock, “He will become ten creeds’ young patriarch at the same time?!”

This was unprecedented!

Zhu Hui chuckled at Lin Rui’s reaction, “The Son of Creation Huang Shuai is the God of Creation Huang Long’s son, and the world rightfully belongs to His Highness Huang Shuai. Therefore merely ten creeds’ young patriarch is nothing. Not to mention just unifying the Divine Tuo Holy World, but if you think about it, don’t the various holy worlds belong to His Highness Huang Shuai?”

Lin Rui was stunned, but he grinned in agreement. “It is me who’s confused. With His Highness Huang Shuai’s origin, it is more than normal for His Highness to manage ten creeds.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The two conversed deeper into the topic, and in almost every sentence, Lin Rui, and Zhu Hui sighed in admiration at Huang Shuai’s outstanding talent that was truly one and only talent.

While the two were subtly conversing, Huang Shi, Yang Jia and Li Zhentong entered the hall from the outer hall. After the two juniors saluted to Lin Rui and Zhu Hui, Yang Jia reported to Lin Rui, “Master, the Dragon Fish Creed Mission Hall’s Vice Hall Master Chen Xi’s personal disciple, Long Jianfei, is waiting outside, seeking an audience with you.”

“What? Chen Xi’s disciple, Long Jianfei!” Lin Rui was obviously astonished hearing that. He then looked at Zhu Hui and said, “I remember that the Dragon Fish Creed had announced Long Jianfei’s death long ago.”

After the Dragon Fish Creed had announced Long Jianfei’s demise, Chen Xi had spoken to Lin Rui about this when he had come to the Blue Lotus Creed in the past. He remembered this because of his good relationship with Chen Xi.

Zhu Hui nodded, “At that time, the Dragon Fish Creed had really tried to find Long Jianfei before announcing his death.” He then shifted his gaze to Yang Jia, as he too was shocked by the news, inwardly.

At that time, Zhu Hui was the Enforcement Hall’s vice hall master. He had some conflict with Chen Xi, and it was not some small conflict. He was aware of Long Jianfei’s death announcement. However, he didn’t know until today that Long Jianfei had returned.

Yang Jia quickly explained, “Long Jianfei explained briefly earlier that he encountered a space crack, and fell into another holy world. He has only managed to come back recently, and he has already gone through the process of restoring his identity at the Dragon Fish Creed’s Blue Rainbow branch.”

I see! Lin Rui thought inwardly.

“There are two people accompanying Long Jianfei. One is a young man Long Jianfei calls His Highness, and the other is a Divination Creed’s inner disciple named Duan Feng,” Li Zhentong added.

“Oh!” Both Lin Rui and Zhu Hui were a little intrigued.

Highness? And also a Divination Creed’s inner disciple?

“According to Long Jianfei, he and Duan Feng are now working for this Highness,” Yang Jia supplemented.

Lin Rui and Zhu Hui were surprised once again.

Two top creeds’ inner disciples are willing to follow this so-called Highness?

Lin Rui struggled inwardly, he had heard rumors that Zhu Hui and Chen Xi were not on good terms.

No doubt, Long Jianfei intended to seek his assistance, but because of Zhu Hui’s presence, he could not promise to help Long Jianfei. Hence, it was better not to see Long Jianfei.

“Go tell Long Jianfei that I’m in the middle of something important right now, so it’s inconvenient for me to see him. Tell them to go back,” Thinking of that, Lin Rui made a quick decision and told Yang Jia solemnly.

“Yes, Master.” Yang Jia and Li Zhentong didn’t date to voice any questions and were about to withdraw from the hall.

“Wait!” Zhu Hui suddenly called out.

The other three people in the hall were a little startled.

“I’m interested to see Long Jianfei, and I’m also a little curious about that Highness.” There was mirth in Zhu Hui’s eyes as he spoke. However, this mirth sent a chill down the others’ back.

Yang Jia and Li Zhentong’s gazes tacitly turned to Lin Rui.

Lin Rui nodded at them, since Zhu Hui wanted to see Long Jainfei, it wasn’t appropriate for him to hinder Zhu Hui.

Thus, Yang Jia and Li Zhentong came out of the hall to bring Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng into the inner main hall.

However, out of kind intention, Yang Jia reminded Long Jianfei, “The Dragon Fish Creed Enforcement Hall Master Zhu Hui is also here.”

Zhu Hui! Long Jianfe’s heart sank the moment he heard that.

Before stepping into the hall, Long Jianfei concisely explained the conflict between his master Chen Xi and Zhu Hui to Huang Xiaolong and Duan Feng.

“This Zhu Hui is that Yu Zhou’s master?” Huang Xiaolong asked placidly.

“Yes, he is, Your Highness.” Long Jianfei hesitated for a beat before confirming, “Zhu Hui would definitely speak harshly when he sees us, Your Highness, you…?”

“It’s fine,” Huang Xiaolong responded without much emotion.

The conversation ended as the three stepped into the inner hall.

The moment they walked into the inner hall, Lin Rui and Zhu Hui’s gazes swept over Huang Xiaolong’s group, and their gazes obviously stopped the longest on Huang Xiaolong.

Clearly, their curiosity towards Huang Xiaolong was higher than their curiosity towards Long Jianfei and Duan Feng.

However, both were baffled. They could see that Huang Xiaolong was merely a peak Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and his cultivation realm was lower than Long Jianfei and Duan Feng. Yet, Long Jianfei and Duan Feng are willing to follow him, why?

“Greetings Creed Patriarch Lin Rui,” Long Jianfei and Duan Feng performed a full salute on their knees towards Lin Rui.

As the Blue Lotus Creed Patriarch, even if Long Jianfei and Duan Feng were inner disciples of Dragon Fish Creed and Divination Creed, they were expected to salute on their knees.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong merely cupped his fists at Lin Rui in greeting.
