Chapter 2946: Huang Xiaolong, You Finally Got What You Deserve!

Upon hearing Huang Xiaolong mention that the cape on Huang Shuai’s shoulders was the Huang Long Cape, the crowd cheered loudly after a moment of brief shock.

“Could it really be the Huang Long Cape?!”

“It’s probably real, the heavenly coercion on it cannot be fake. Also, there are those dragon runes that are so profound. Only Lord Huang Long could forge such a complex design!”

Even Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingye, and other patriarchs too seemed astonished, and it was obvious from their reactions that they didn’t know the Huang Long Cape was in Huang Shuai’s possession.

While others were in shock, Huang Shuai looked at Huang Xiaolong smugly, “That’s right, it’s the Huang Long Cape. So what if you have the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, eleven high-order Saint Fates, and three dao souls? I have the Huang Long Cape, and no one’s speed is faster than me, and counting these peak-grade dao artifacts Golden Dragon Twin Blades, these are more than enough to kill you!”

“Die!”

Rays of icy light burst out from Huang Shuai’s eyes. In the next second, he disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Huang Xiaolong raised his vigilance to the highest level, and quickly protected himself from all angles with cosmos energy. At the same time, he pushed his palm forward.

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s cosmos energy fully enveloped him, and his palm had pushed forward, two sharp blade rays drew across the air, dispersing Huang Xiaolong’s palm force. The two blade rays cut through Huang Xiaolong’s cosmos energy protective barrier and slashed Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Huang Xiaolong grunted in pain, and his body was slammed back. He was several hundred meters away before Huang Xiaolong managed to regain his footing. There were two gaping blade cuts across his chest, flowing with golden-colored blood!

How many years had it been since Huang Xiaolong had last suffered any injuries? All along, Huang Xiaolong had always been the one who had overwhelmed his enemies, with his almost invincible physique, yet today, despite having successfully cultivated the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, he was injured!

Backtracked several hundred meters where Huang Xiaolong was originally standing, was a smug looking Huang Shuai. “What do you think, Huang Xiaolong, my Golden Dragon Twin Blades are quite sharp, aren’t they?”

“What Dao Body of Heaven and Earth? It doesn’t seem to have much to shout about.” Huang Shuai laughed.

Huang Xiaolong let out a cold snort. If it wasn’t for the Huang Long Cape, how could Huang Shuai have injured his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth by merely relying on those peak-grade dao artifacts Golden Dragons Twin Blades even if his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth had only achieved minor completion.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t panic after being injured, and his gaze on Huang Shuai seemed feverish. More accurately, he was looking at the Huang Long Cape on Huang Shuai’s shoulders. Huang Long Cape’s speed was indeed amazing, Huang Shuai was merely a peak late-First Esteem Dao Venerable, yet Huang Shuai was so fast that he couldn’t even capture Huang Shuai’s presence!

It was all because of the Huang Long Cape that boosted Huang Shuai’s battle strength to this degree, enabling Huang Shuai to injure him!

When a person’s speed reached an extreme limit, it raised that person’s attack power to a terrifying degree. It was the same theory as a bullet; put a bullet on the ground, it doesn’t have any lethality at all, but because of speed, a bullet can cause great damage.

“Huang Xiaolong, accept your death.” Huang Shuai laughed loudly as he once again disappeared from view. In the next second, two sharp rays drew horizontal arcs across Huang Xiaolong’s neck.

Huang Xiaolong was sent flying again, and on his neck was two glaring slashes. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Huang Shuai let out another hearty laughter, “Eleven high-order Saint Fates? Everything’s garbage in front of my strength and speed. Huang Xiaolong, don’t say I didn’t give you a chance, so summon your eleven high-order Saint Fates and three dao souls.”

Having successfully knocked Huang Xiaolong off twice, Huang Shuai gained confidence, and he was no longer in a hurry to kill Huang Xiaolong. He stood leisurely in the air, while looking at Huang Xiaolong with undisguised bloodthirst. He wanted Huang Xiaolong to summon his eleven high-order Saint Fates, and three dao souls. That way, it would create a greater impact when he killed Huang Xiaolong, elevating his Son of Creation’s might to another level.

Yin Yue was filled with worry watching Huang Xiaolong being knocked down repeatedly by Huang Shuai. Initially, she was delighted that Huang Xiaolong had the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, but who knew that Huang Shuai would possess the Huang Long Cape!

That was the Huang Long Cape, a creation artifact personally forged by Lord Huang Long himself!

Xuanyuan Potian, Yang Jia, Lu Chengfeng, and others broke into smiles watching this.

Yang Jia chortled, “What His Highness Huang Shuai is the way of the world. He stands before ultimate strength and speed and everything else, including eleven high-order Saint Fates as they are rubbish!”

Xuanyuan Potian chuckled, “Huang Xiaolong’s dead for sure!”

According to them, Huang Xiaolong was incapable of dodging Huang Shuai’s attacks, and it was only a matter of time before Huang Xiaolong died.

Liu Xinxin’s dao soul was thrilled and shouted excitedly, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re finally getting what you deserve! His Highness Huang Shuai will flay the flesh off your body piece by piece!”

Out of nowhere, the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng looked sharply at Liu Xinxin and snapped, “Shut your trap!”

His action rendered everyone stupefied.

Especially Liu Xinxin, she couldn’t understand why the Lord Patriarch would suddenly snap at her.

Even Li Xue had not expected that.

Huang Xiaolong’s fingers touched the wounds on his neck as he faced Huang Shuai’s smug face. A light flashed over his body, and the wounds on his chest and neck disappeared in the blink of an eye. Scabs fell to the ground, revealing the skin underneath that was smooth as ever. This was the amazingness of Dao Body of Heaven and Earth. Whether it was defense, power, and recovery, all aspects were just as startling.

The others had not reacted at the speed of Huang Xiaolong’s recovery, and once again, Huang Xiaolong was enveloped in flashes of light as, one after another high-order Saint Fates flew out from his body.

Soon, there were eleven high-order Saint Fates in high air.

“Huang Xiaolong really has eleven high-order Saint Fates!”

Most of the people on the scene had never seen Huang Xiaolong’s eleven high-order Saint Fates, and witnessing the long line of high-order Saint Fates in the air was truly a soul-shocking sight.

Strong jealousy swam in Huang Shuai’s eyes as he, being the Son of Creation, only had ten high-order Saint Fates.

Suddenly, there was another bright flash over Huang Xiaolong’s body as the twelfth high-order Saint Fate flew out.

Huang Shuai was dumbfounded.

Xuanyuan Potian was dumbfounded.

Yin Yue was dumbfounded.

Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng, Divination Creed Patriarch Wu Kun, Red Fox Creed Patriarch Hu Qingyue, and the rest of the top-tier creeds’ patriarchs, ancient races, and genesis races’ patriarchs, as well as ancestors, were dumbfounded.

All of them were looking at the Saint Fates above Huang Xiaolong.

“Twelve high-order Saint Fates!”

It’s twelve high-order Saint Fates, not eleven!

The shock was insufficient to describe what everyone felt.

This was more than unprecedented, and this was literally the sole person in ten thousand eras.

Twelve high-order Saint Fates enveloped in rings of bright lights, lighting up even the darkest corners of Dragon Fish City.

Before the crowd recovered, one after another Xuanhuang dragons flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, and they were human-shaped Xuanhuang dragons.

“Is this a bloodline power?” a Primal Ancestor expert in the crowd asked.

“No, this is cosmos energy a small world that has taken shape!” The one answering him in a quivering voice was his master, an Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable expert.

The Primal Ancestor was stunned. Can’t only high-level Dao Venerable experts’ small world cosmos energy take forms?!

Then, a group of nefarious beings flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, exuding sinister and evil auras, as well as chilling coldness.

Eyes were protruding out from their sockets.

“This cannot also be a small world’s cosmos energy that has taken shape, right?” the Primal Ancestor expert asked jokingly. He turned to look at his master and found that his master was staring at Huang Xiaolong fixedly, as if he had seen a ghost in broad daylight, “The cosmos energy of two small worlds.”

Cosmos energy of two small worlds!

Huang Shuai stared dazedly at Huang Xiaolong!

Xuanyuan Potian and Liu Xinxin were dazed. Bi Cheng, Hu Qingyue, and others were the same. Can one person have cosmos energy of two small worlds?
