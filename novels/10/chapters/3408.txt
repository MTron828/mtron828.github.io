Chapter 3409: Heavenless Devil Palace

Everyone present, especially the five sages, were shocked.

The five of them failed to budge the mountain even after using everything they had!

Just a few minutes ago, the Lord of Primal Beginnings was thinking of gathering all his martial brothers and sisters to surround Huang Xiaolong. He heaved a sigh of relief for not trying anything stupid. If he acted a little more rashly, he would have been sealed under the Five Finger Mountain like Rulai.

Lao Zi sighed, “Huang Xiaolong’s strength has already surpassed our expectations. We can only wait for master’s return in order to save Junior Brother Rulai.”

“But… Master has left the Pangu World for several years now. Who knows when he will return.” Nuwa shook her head and mumbled.

It seemed as though Rulai would be in for some long days.

As one of the six sages, Rulai was the Buddha Ancestor. He was the power holding up the western continent, and no one knew whether he was still breathing under the Five Finger Mountain. Killing him would be a much more merciful option.

Huang Xiaolong’s punishment was a humiliation for the western continent! Now that Rulai was gone, Nuwa could imagine the fate of the Buddhist factions. They would be in for a hard time.

The experts of the western factions saw how Laozi and the other sages failed to save Rulai from the Five Finger Mountain, and they couldn’t help but express their misery. They gathered around the mountain and they mourned.

Laozi shook his head before bidding farewell to Nuwa and the rest. He left on his azure ox, and the others quickly left.

Only the Queen Mother of the West and the Jade Emperor were left on the Kunlun Mountain.

Looking at the experts of the western continent, a frown formed on the Queen Mother of the West’s face. They were in her territory, and they were being extremely noisy as they mourned for their ancestor. How was she supposed to cultivate in peace?!

However, she knew that they wanted to save her junior brother, and she couldn’t possibly chase them away.

“Junior sister, would you like to stay over at my side for the time being?” The Jade Emperor shot his shot at the opportunity.

After hesitating for a second, she nodded her head. “Alright.”

The Jade Emperor nearly jumped in joy if not for the fact that there were experts of the western continent mourning around him. He quickly got on his carriage before inviting the Queen Mother of the West back to the Heavenly Palace.

The battle that happened on Kunlun Mountain caused the three worlds in the Pangu World to fall silent.

No one dared to poke their heads out now that the strongest expert in the Immortal World was suppressed under a treasure he created himself.

The fanfare around the five continents died down, and the markets lost more than half their customer base. There were even several kingdoms that isolated themselves completely.

When people spoke to each other, they would do so in hushed tones as if they were afraid of awakening some monstrous existence.

It was especially so when they spoke about the Gathering of the Immortal Peaches. The meet had turned into a taboo, and no one could speak of it openly.

Of course, there were some people who would bring up the events that happened.

…

After leaving the Kunlun Mountain, Huang Xiaolong’s party went straight to the Devil World.

Along the way, Sun Wukong roared with laughter, “Hahaha! That old fart Rulai definitely didn’t think that he would suffer such a terrible fate! He can have a taste of what it’s like staying under the Five Finger Mountain!”

He retrieved the immortal peaches he stole and presented them to Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, these peaches are pretty awesome! You should try some!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled and he bit into one of them. Fragrance exploded in his mouth, and spiritual qi filled his body. He felt extremely refreshed.

“It’s pretty good.” Huang Xiaolong commended. “It’s no wonder mortals will be able to turn immortal after eating a single one.” He spoke to the others after he finished his peach, “All of you should try some too.”

Sun Wukong and the others thanked Huang Xiaolong before they chowed down. Since the monkey grabbed more than a thousand of them, there were more than enough for the four of them.

However, Huang Xiaolong took half of them as he planned to share them with the members of the Huang Family after he returned to Earth. Once he retrieved the Pangu Sword, he would have to return anyway.

“Your Highness, you should have killed the old fart.” Sun Wukong said in between bites. “In the future, the old baldy will definitely take the chance to get back at Your Highness.”

“Didn’t you hear? His Highness allowed him to live after Nuwa pleaded for mercy.” The Holy Phoenix glared at the Monkey King and snapped.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “That’s not all.” It was true that Nuwa was a part of the reason he spared Rulai, but that wasn’t all.

“Your Highness, do you mean… Dao Ancestor Hong Jun?!” Ying Gou asked.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

That was the real reason.

After all, Rulai was someone who had received Hong Jun’s enlightenment. He was one of the six sages, and killing him would be slapping Hong Jun in the face! Hong Jun wouldn’t let it slide.

With Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he wasn’t Hong Jun’s opponent. As such, he could only allow Rulai to live.

Even though Hong Jun would probably be enraged after learning that Rulai was suppressed under the Five Finger Mountain, he would definitely have to accept his losses when he learned that Huang Xiaolong’s master was the Blazing Dragon.

His master was the Blazing Dragon, the oldest expert in the universe! Anyone who wanted to touch him would have to think twice.

When Ying Gou mentioned Hong Jun, Sun Wukong finally calmed down. A look of fear formed on the Holy Phoenix’s face. “I wonder how strong Dao Ancestor Hong Jun really is!”

“He’s definitely in the God of Creation Realm.” Huang Xiaolong explained. “However, there are different levels among the Gods of Creation. It’s split into different stages, and it starts from the minor completion, major completion, perfection, and grand perfection stage!”

Huang Xiaolong estimated that Hong Jun was at the peak of the minor completion stage. He might be able to enter the major completion stage at any time, and someone at that level would possess three billion units of grand cosmos energy! A God of Creation at the grand perfection stage would possess seven billion units, and one would possess nine billion units at the perfection stage!

His master, the old dragon, possessed nearly nine billion units of grand cosmos energy!

As for Huang Sheng, he would be an existence with nearly ten billion units of grand cosmos energy. Rumors had it that one would be able to surpass the God of Creation Realm if they broke through the ten billion mark! They would be able to reach a whole new realm!

The universe had been in existence for a long time, but no one had ever been able to cross that mark!

“Your Highness, you should be close to the God of Creation Realm, right?” Ying Gou asked.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, but he didn’t explain himself.

He was definitely close to the God of Creation Realm, but his actual strength had already surpassed an ordinary God of Creation.

Sun Wukong’s lips cracked open and he giggled, “No sh*t! His Highness is definitely the strongest expert under the God of Creation Realm! He can sweep anyone who isn’t one! Didn’t you see how he dealt with that old baldy from the west?!”

“You’re full of sh*t!” The Holy Phoenix snorted.

Sun Wukong’s face flushed red, and he didn’t know what to say. After all, he wouldn’t be able to beat her in a fight anyway.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the entrance of the Devil World.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If Heavenless learns that Your Highness has arrived, he will definitely be hiding in a hole somewhere.” Sun Wukong laughed.

After the four entered the Devil World, they pierced through countless layers of devil qi.

“We’ll head over to the Heavenless Devil Palace.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

The Heavenless Devil Palace was the home of the Heavenless Devil Ancestor, and it was clear why Huang Xiaolong was headed there.
