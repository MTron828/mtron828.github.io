Chapter 2147: Heaven Beyond Heavens

Although the Heavenly Terror Country and Heavenly Saint Country were both located at the deeper region of the Heavens Path, the Heavens Path itself was bigger than one could imagine. The Heavenly Saint Ruler told Huang Xiaolong that a Ninth Order Sovereign Realm expert would take more than a month to reach the Heavenly Terror Country from the Heavenly Saint Country.

When speaking of the Heavenly Terror Country, the Heavenly Saint Ruler wore a grim expression.

“Is he suspected to be an early Tenth Order Sovereign?” Huang Xiaolong asked the Heavenly Saint Ruler.

“Yes, Your Majesty.” The Heavenly Saint Ruler nodded and added, “I fought the Heavenly Terror Ruler a long time ago. At that time, he was already a peak late-Ninth Order Sovereign. Hence, it sounds right that he must be an early Tenth Order Sovereign now. Not to mention that he has the Eye of Terror. Although his Eye of Terror is not a saint artifact, it is powerful and equivalent to Your Majesty’s lightning bead!”

“Eye of Terror?” Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed as he asked, “Is it a high-grade supreme spiritual artifact?”

“Yes,” The Heavenly Saint Ruler confirmed.

“Why are there so many supreme spiritual artifacts in the Heavens Path?” Huang Xiaolong asked the question that had been baffling him. “Where did all your supreme spiritual artifacts come from?” He had long been curious about this.

The Heavenly Saint Ruler dared not conceal anything and answered honestly, “In the proximity of the 33 Heavenly Gates, there is another separate space. There are supreme spiritual artifacts inside this separate space. All the supreme spiritual artifacts in the Heavens Path were found there. However, there are many unnerving restrictions around the 33 Heavenly Gates. Even a Tenth Order Sovereign venturing in there would face complete extermination if he were to trigger the restrictions around the 33 Heavenly Gates!”

“Because that space is in close proximity to the 33 Heavenly Gates, the entire space is also included within the range of the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions. Therefore, it is extremely dangerous to enter the space. In general, we wait until the period when the restrictions around the 33 Heavenly Gates weaken. That is the only time we dare to venture in.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hide the surprise from his voice, “The 33 heavens?”

“Yes, that is so, Your Majesty.” The Heavenly Saint Country’s Ruler went on, “We are also unable to predict when the restrictions will weaken and how long the restrictions will remain in the weakened state. Hence, entering the space when the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions weaken is still very risky.”

“In the past, a Tenth Order Sovereign Realm expert entered the space looking for supreme spiritual artifacts when the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions weakened. Unfortunately, the surrounding restrictions suddenly became stronger in half a day when he was still inside. That Tenth Order Sovereign died in that space before he could come out!”

Huang Xiaolong frowned, “A Tenth Order Sovereign, yet he was unable to withstand the restrictions’ power around the 33 Heavenly Gates?” If that was the case, then it was going to be troublesome for him to venture in.

“That is the truth, Your Majesty.” The Heavenly Saint Ruler paused briefly then added, “I’m afraid no one can withstand the power of the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions, including late-Tenth Order Sovereigns unless one gathers the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools!”

“The Nine Chaos Lighting Pools?!” Huang Xiaolong almost froze on the spot in surprise.

“Yes, in fact, the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions are all lightning element restrictions. Some days ago, after studying some ancient records, I discovered a note saying that, if one can gather the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools and transform them into a Grandmist Lightning Pool, then one can fend off the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions!”

The Heavenly Saint Ruler nodded his head as he spoke, “On top of that, if one gathers the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools and transforms them into the Grandmist Lightning Pool, then the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions could be resolved!”

“Then one can open the 33 Heavenly Gates and cross to the Holy World!”

Huang Xiaolong breathed out loudly.

So, it is like that.

It was no wonder the Heavenly Saint Ruler was adamant to get the chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool.

“One needs to gather the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools and transform them into the Grandmist Lightning Pool. Then only a person can open the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions?! Other than you, who else knows this secret?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The Heavenly Saint Ruler hesitated before speaking, “Initially, only Lan Shifan and I were aware of this secret. However, from Zhu Xinyi’s report, when I exhorted them to search for the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool, the Mighty God Heavenly Country learned about it as well. I suspect that the Mighty God Heavenly Country’s ruler has guessed the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools’ importance. Which was why they were competing for the Chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool.”

“Whether the Mighty God Heavenly Country knows that gathering the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools can open the 33 Heavenly Gates, I am not sure.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Several days later.

Huang Xiaolong and the others stepped into the Heavenly Saint Country’s land.

The moment Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the Heavenly Saint Country, they faintly felt the origin energy unique to that space. Spiritual beasts roamed freely within the country. Precious fruits hung on lush sacred trees. Winding mountains and gurgling springs were breathtakingly surreal. The sights were even more beautiful than the Divine World. It was no wonder that the Heavenly Saint World was hailed as one of the top five heavenly countries in the Heavens Path.

On top of that, Huang Xiaolong could feel the powerful restrictions within and around the Heavenly Saint Country’s space, and these were many times stronger than the Divine World.

It would have been a strenuous battle for Huang Xiaolong to defeat the Heavenly Saint Ruler despite having the lightning bead if they had battled within this Heavenly Saint Country’s space. The Heavenly Saint Country’s origin energy would have boosted the Heavenly Saint Ruler’s strength immensely.

Huang Xiaolong’s group stayed at the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace.

At night, a blanket of darkness covered the land.

Threads of silvery moonlight raised a hazy veil over the darkness.

Gazing at the Heavenly Saint Country’s full moon, it reminded Huang Xiaolong of his family, especially Shi Xiaofei.

Even though the Huang Family and Shi Xiaofei had ascended to the Divine World, Huang Xiaolong had not really had the time to stay by their side for long due to various reasons. Guilt reared its head in his chest as he thought of this.

Huang Xiaolong decided that after dealing with things in the Heavens Path, he would take some time to accompany Shi Xiaofei and the other girls as well.

Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts subsequently drifted to the Heavenly Master, Wan Shi, Tian Chen, and the Heavenly Terror Country.

However, considering the Heavenly Terror Country’s power, Huang Xiaolong decided to refine the chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool and raise his strength. After that, he would head to the Heavenly Terror Country when he had a full grasp of success.

After all, based on Heavenly Terror Country’s overall strength, and if a fight broke out within the Heavenly Terror Country, it would be hard for Huang Xiaolong to snatch a victory even with the lightning bead. This would mainly happen because the Heavenly Terror Country’s side would get a considerable boost in their strength by borrowing the Heavenly Terror Country’s origin energy.

After refining the remaining half of the Barbarian space’s lightning bead’s power, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had reached the peak of mid-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm. Just a little bit more, and he would step into late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm. Followed by refining the chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool and the three origin pills he had obtained from the Heavenly Saint Ruler, Huang Xiaolong had the full confidence of advancing to the late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm.

“Origin pill.” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath.

From talking with the Heavenly Saint Ruler, Huang Xiaolong had learned that there were two places in the Heavens Path where one could obtain origin pills. One of them was the 33 Heavenly Gates’ space, and the other was the Heaven Valley. However, the restrictions around the 33 Heavenly Gates were a nightmare. Huang Xiaolong would have to wait until the restrictions weakened before he could enter.

Therefore, his preferred option was the Heaven Valley.

The Heaven Valley was the sole trading market in the Heavens Path. Good stuff that flowed out from the many heavenly countries in the Heavens Path would be traded in the Heaven Valley. Sometimes, in order to get what they wanted, some heavenly countries would take out origin pills to trade.

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong combed his plans. First, he would refine the chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool, followed by the three origin pills he had gotten from the Heavenly Saint Ruler. After breaking through to late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm, he would make a trip to the Heaven Valley.

With sufficient origin pills, he could advance to the Seventh Order Sovereign. At that time, he could easily defeat the Heavenly Terror Country’s ruler inside the Heavenly Terror Country.
