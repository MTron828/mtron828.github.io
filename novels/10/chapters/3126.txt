Chapter 3127: Heaven Piercer

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he heard their description. Appearances were merely superficial aspects when it came to how he judged ladies. Shi Xiaofei and Li Lu were the prettiest beauties in his eyes.

“Xiaofei…” Huang Xiaolong’s mind started to wander.

A sudden yearning towards Shi Xiaofei and the other members of the Huang Family appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s mind all of a sudden.

As he thought of them, he decided to ask He Zhen and the others if it was possible to return to the lower worlds.

“Lower world?!” Lei Yu and the others stared at each other in shock.

“Since the start of time, no one has ever heard of anyone descending to the lower worlds.” Di Fan, one of the beast kings, shook his head. “However, if one reaches perfection level in all thirteen elements, there might be a chance. According to the legends, anyone who possesses the power of thirteen elements at perfection level would possess unimaginable power! They would be invincible under the God of Creation Realm!”

“However, it won’t be easy to reach such a level.” Another beast king piped up. “In the Huang Long World, no one had ever managed to comprehend all thirteen elements, much less reach perfection level in all of them!”

“Other people might not be able to do it, but His Highness will definitely be able to.” He Zhen growled.

Huang Xiaolong felt a headache coming. He barely managed to reach perfection level in five different elements, and he didn’t know how long it would take for him to reach perfection level in all thirteen of them! One had to know that the power of space was nearly impossible to comprehend, and he hadn’t even started on the power of time! Wouldn’t it take several hundred thousand years if he kept up the current pace?!

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong and the others crossed the Red Rock Mountain Range and arrived at one of the cities populated by members of the origin lands.

“This is Red Rock City!” He Zhen explained. “It’s one of the largest and most important cities in the Origin Lands! It’s also one of the cities belonging to the Red Lion Patriarch.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

The Red Lion Race, Lightning Phoenix Race, Nine Eyed Black Tiger Race, and several others made up the ten strongest races in the Origin Lands. The Red Lion Patriarch was one of the ten overlords who ruled supreme in the Origin Lands.

Like the Origin Holy World, there were countless races that populated the Origin Lands. All of them were known as the Origin Races.

“Let’s rest for a little bit in the city. We shall search for some information before continuing on our way.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Lei Yu and the others nodded in acknowledgement, and it didn’t take long for them to enter the city.

As the Red Rock City was one of the most important cities in the Origin Lands, it was exceptionally busy. Huang Xiaolong discovered that there were quite a lot of experts from the Origin Holy World walking along the streets.

All of them were descendants of experts who managed to cross the frozen waterfall. After all, the experts who came over had the same goal as Huang Xiaolong and it was to look for treasures.

The Origin Races were never prejudiced against the humans, and they were able to coexist in peace.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong and the others managed to rent a courtyard. Huang Xiaolong hastily sent all of them out to search for information on Di Shuang and the Son of Mystic. It didn’t take long for them to return to report their findings.

Di Fan started first. “Your Highness, the leader should be in the Black Frost Abyss…”

The nine of them called Di Shuang their leader, and even though it was hard to find news on him, there were still several organizations in the Origin Lands capable enough to do so. Of course, everything required a corresponding price. The money the nine beast kings spent was an astronomical amount when compared with the wealth owned by several creeds.

The reports stated that Di Shuang was still in the Black Frost Abyss, but none of them could be one hundred percent sure.

Of course, no one could determine where Di Shuang was in the Black Frost Abyss. As the Black Frost Abyss was boundless, it was hard to pinpoint the location of a single person.

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong was confident he could find the man as long as they knew his general location.

As for the Son of Mystic, no one managed to secure any news on him. After all, no one knew what he looked like.

“Your Highness, we also heard that the Heaven Piercer would be headed straight for the Boundless City.” He Zhen reported.

The Boundless City was one of the cities located at the edge of the Origin Lands. It was also the city closest to the Origin Sea. If Huang Xiaolong and the others wanted to travel to the Origin Sea,they would have to pass through countless regions. They would definitely run into a lot of trouble, and if they managed to get on the flying ship of one of the strongest chambers of commerce in the Origin Lands, they would be able to save themselves a ton of time.

After all, the Heaven Piercer belonged to an organization that had ties in many regions. No one would obstruct them for fun.

“Heaven Transportation Organization” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Yes. The Heaven Piercer belongs to the Treasure Lake Chamber of Commerce. It’s one of their best flying ships, and it’s extremely quick. Even though it cannot compare to a quasi creation artifact, it’s definitely faster than peak-grade cosmos artifacts.” He Zhen explained.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. The Treasure Lake Chamber of Commerce was one of the largest chambers of commerce in the Origin Lands, and it was said that they had some relationship with the Lightning Phoenix Race and the Nine Eyed Black Tiger Race. Of course, everything revolved around benefits. They were able to provide the two super races with enough benefits, ensuring their prosperity.

“Will the Heaven Piercer be traveling through the Black Frost Abyss?”

The reason Huang Xiaolong went all the way to the Origin Lands wasn’t just for the Tree of Origin. Di Shuang and the Son of Mystic were also part of the reason.

“Yes, the Heaven Piercer will be stopping in the Black Frost Abyss for three days.” He Zhen continued, “Even though they will only be stopping for a short period of time, we can always use dao coins to make them remain there for several more days.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “Three days is more than enough.”

As long as Di Shuang was in the Black Frost Abyss, Huang Xiaolong was more than confident of locating him and forcing him to submit in three mere days.

Huang Xiaolong asked about the other regions where the Heaven Piercer would be stopping.

“Ancient Era City?” Huang Xiaolong’s heart shook a little when he heard that they would be stopping for three days in the Ancient Era City.

The branch of the Mystical Pavilion in the Origin Lands was located in the Ancient Era City!

Perhaps, the Son of Mystic would head there the moment he came to the Origin Lands!

Plans started to pop up in Huang Xiaolong’s head.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong sent He Zhen out to purchase tickets on board the Heaven Piercer. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Before they could celebrate, He Zhen returned to inform Huang Xiaolong that all the first-class tickets on board were booked. There were only tickets in the second-class cabins, and Huang Xiaolong was shocked. The first-class cabins were extremely expensive, and a single ticket would cost more than several hundred thousand dao coins. Who in the world had the ability to buy them out?

“Second-class it is…” Huang Xiaolong sighed. Even though the first-class cabins were comfortable and full of spiritual energy, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about that.

He Zhen went out to get thirteen second-class tickets, and all of them headed straight for the Heaven Piercer.

One day before the Heaven Piercer left the port, the Red Rock City received a heaven-shaking piece of news.

“Princess Lei Qianqian is coming for a visit!”

“Princess Lei is planning to go on a journey to the Boundless City and she’s here to get on board the Heaven Piercer!”
