Chapter 2679: Who Dares to Make Trouble At My Dragon Fish Race’s Headquarters?!

Not only Long Haiqin, but anyone hearing a peak late-Sixth Heaven True Saint brat claiming that he had suppressed a Primal Ancestor Realm expert in a late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, would bend over laughing.

As the patriarch of a royal family, as well as a cultivator on the verge of stepping into Primal Ancestor Realm, generally, Long Haiqin would not laugh so wantonly in public, but he really could not hold his laughter in.

The four guards, too, were almost keeled over laughing.

Long Jianfei had been watching everything transpiring outside from the great hall. When he heard Huang Xiaolong’s claim about suppressing Mo Jincheng, he was dazed for a while. After that he shook his head with a helpless smile.

Huang Xiaolong watched Long Haiqin laugh, until he felt that Long Haiqin had laughed enough. He raised his fingers and gently flicked towards Long Haiqin, just like how one would flick away dust on their body.

Long Haiqin saw Huang Xiaolong making a flicking gesture towards him, and his face sank. He snapped, “Brat, do you really think…?” But before he could finish his sentence, his eyes widened in panic.

Long Haiqin was swept into the air akin to a leaf carried by a tempest, and thrown back into the Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters. His body smashed through the garden’s stones and fountains, and several buildings, heading straight towards the great hall where Long Jianfei was located.

From inside the great hall, Long Jianfei pushed forward with his palms in order to stop Long Haiqin rolling back, but he discovered that the force carrying Long Haiqin exceeded his imagination. In a moment of carelessness, the force from Long Haiqin’s body knocked him, a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, staggering back. The two of them shattered the main seat in the great hall, broke a hole through the wall, and finally stopped in an inconspicuous corner of the headquarters.

The four guards’ laughter came to an abrupt stop. They stared dazedly at the path of destruction left behind by Long Haiqin, tracing it up until they saw Long Haiqin and Long Jianfei’s less than majestic figures in an inconspicuous corner of the headquarters.

“Who dares to make trouble at my Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters?!” an angry shout reverberated in the air, as Dragon Fish Race’s True Saint Realm experts whistled across the air one after another with overbearing momentums pressing down on everyone.

Huang Xiaolong’s small attack had alerted the Dragon Fish Race’s several hundred True Saint experts, who were currently inside the headquarters.

There were several hundred True Saints in the headquarters. This just showed how strong the Dragon Fish Race’s foundation was.

But a while after these Dragon Fish Race’s True Saint Realm experts appeared with world-shaking wrath, all of their momentum sizzled out when they spotted Long Jianfei and Long Haiqin in an inconspicuous corner.

Even the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm Dragon Fish Race’s Eminent Elder, who was roaring at the top of his lungs earlier, deflated.

As their senses recovered, these Dragon Fish Race’s experts’ gazes fell on Huang Xiaolong with shock rippling in their eyes.

Right at this time, a terrifying force surged out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, covering the entire Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters. Under Huang Xiaolong’s show of might, those Dragon Fish Race’s experts standing high in the air with billowing anger, plummeted to the ground. All of them were slapped to the ground by an overwhelming invisible force.

The four guards were slammed into the air by the sudden surge of force from Huang Xiaolong’s body. At the same time, Huang Xiaolong passed through the Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters’ main entrance.

Those Dragon Fish Race’s experts, who had fallen from the air, watched Huang Xiaolong enter with trepidation.

Who says that this is a Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm? This is literally a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

None of them dared to move.

In truth, they were unable to move with Huang Xiaolong’s coercive force pressing down on them.

In the meantime, Long Jianfei had pulled Long Haiqin up from the ground, and both of them were looking at Huang Xiaolong with uncertainty and apprehension. It was especially so for Long Haiqin, who had laughed till his belly had ached earlier, but now, he was as pale as a corpse. He was trembling, feeling like he had taken a trip to hell and back. Deep down, he was aware that if Huang Xiaolong had wanted to kill him, he wouldn't be standing up right now.

A dark cloud of doubt cast a shadow over Long Jianfei’s face. After a while, he finally cupped his fists and spoke, “This Lord, Long Haiqin was rude and offended you. I apologize on his behalf.”

If the average low-level, or mid-level Primal Ancestor experts had dared to injure Long Haiqin right in front of the Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters, Long Jianfei would have demanded an explanation regardless who the attacker was. But facing Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei opted to apologize and lowered his stance.

Huang Xiaolong came to a stop in front of Long Jianfei and Long Haiqin, and then extended his hand out. Long Jianfei was baffled by Huang Xiaolong’s action, but soon reacted, and quickly returned the Devil Eye Token to Huang Xiaolong with both of his hands.

Rubbing the Devil Eye Token in his hand, Huang Xiaolong spoke his next words to Long Haiqin, “I didn’t pick up this Devil Eye Token.”

Long Haiqin’s face turned beet-red from embarrassment, but unfortunately, there wasn’t any hole in the ground for him to disappear into.

Long Jianfei blanked for the briefest second, then laughed in flattery, “Lord must be joking because with Lord’s identity, a mere Devil Eye Token is unworthy to be picked up by you.”

Huang Xiaolong put away the Devil Eye Token and responded tepidly, “How could my identity compare to Old Ancestor Long Jianfei, as even taking out the Devil Eye Token is unworthy to see you.”

Long Jianfei chuckled in embarrassment, and could only say, “Lord really likes to joke!”

By this time, Long Jianfei could see Huang Xiaolong bore no malice, and this point greatly eased the tension in his heart. But he was really frightened when Huang Xiaolong walked into the headquarters, causing him to break out in cold sweat.

Long Haiqin wisely stepped forward and apologizied to Huang Xiaolong.

Watching their Dragon Fish Race’s Patriarch Long Haiqin’s flustered demeanor, Huang Xiaolong accepted his apology and no longer pursued the matter.

Long Jianfei subsequently sent the rest away, and made a strict order that not a word of that day’s event could be passed out, or they would be punished as a traitor.

Long Jianfei invited Huang Xiaolong up to the main seat, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t feign politeness and sat down with ease.

“Lord, pardon my ignorance, you are?” After everyone had taken their seats, Long Jianfei couldn’t help asking. He had searched through his own memories but couldn’t pinpoint Huang Xiaolong’s identity, and didn’t know when such an expert had appeared amongst the human race.

Long Haiqin was furtively and apprehensively observing Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong,” Huang Xiaolong did not conceal his identity.

“What?! Huang, Huang Xiaolong! The Otherworldly Mansion’s Young Master!” Long Jianfei jumped up from his seat as he exclaimed in shock.

Long Haiqin’s reaction was bigger than his old ancestor.

Wasn’t there a rumor that claimed Huang Xiaolong was besieged by Yuan Qianxing’s group and was forced to jump into the Death Cave?

For a period, this news was the hottest topic, and Long Jianfei, as the Dragon Fish Race’s old ancestor, had obviously heard about it.

At that time, he felt it was a pity that a genius like Huang Xiaolong had died so young.

Huang Xiaolong was still alive! And he was standing in front of them!

At this moment, they finally realized why the Devil Eye City was destroyed.

Mo Jincheng was one of the people who had besieged Huang Xiaolong.

Long Jianfei and Long Haiqin’s reaction did not surprise Huang Xiaolong. He, a supposedly dead man, had suddenly appeared in front of them. It would be strange if these two acted calmly instead.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

A long time later, Long Haiqin recovered from his shock and bowed to Huang Xiaolong, “So, it’s Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, I have been rude.”

Earlier, he had suspected that Huang Xiaolong was a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert disguising as a Sixth Heaven True Saint, but now, he understood he was mistaken.

Of course, after learning Huang Xiaolong’s identity, Long Haiqin was even more respectful and in awe.

“Your Highness came to our Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters?” Long Jianfei asked politely, for he couldn’t figure out the reason Huang Xiaolong was visiting them specifically.
