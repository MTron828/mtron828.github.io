Huang Xiaolong was quite surprised to find out that the Heaven Resentment Emperor’s reputation was comparable to the Massacring Gods Gate’s old ancestor, Chu Han.

If that was indeed true, then it was definitely a big problem for him. Even if the Heaven Resentment Emperor hadn’t exceeded the Emperor Realm, he would be infinitely close to it.

If he were to join forces with Chu Han, Huang Xiaolong felt that the risk he was about to take had increased immensely.

“Your Majesty, should we ask Tai Yue, Jin Yuan, and the rest of them to come over?” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin asked.

Huang Xiaolong contemplated for a moment before saying, “There’s no need for that.” Even if he were to summon them now, they would take two months to arrive.

“However, what if the Heaven Resentment Emperor and Chu Han have joined hands...?” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin asked worriedly.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Don’t worry about it. We will head to the Black Ant City now.” He pointed to the center of the Heaven Resentment Continent.

The place they were going to was the heart of the Black Ant Clan’s headquarters—Black Ant City!

Since Huang Xiaolong had never exposed the fourteen Radiance Angels from his Heavenly Hall, nobody knew about his secret. Hence, it wasn’t out of his expectations that the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin was overreacting.

Seeing that it could not persuade Huang Xiaolong, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin had no choice but to continue flying towards Black Ant City.

It decided that as soon as it sensed any danger, it would flee with Huang Xiaolong immediately.

An ordinary-looking old elf was sitting on the throne of the Black Ant Clan. He was precisely the Masacrring Gods Gate’s old ancestor, Chu Han! Below him, there was the tall and green-eyed patriarch of the Black Ant Clan, Liao Yuan, and the other elders.

Chu Han looked at Liao Yuan and the rest of them, and said, “I just received news that someone barged into White Bones City not too long ago. When the city lord, Yan Duo, tried to stop them, he was severely injured by the trespassers in one move.”

The entire Black Ant Clan was shocked.

“Senior Chu Han, is that kid, Duwei, here?!” The patriarch of the Black Ant Clan, Liao Yuan, said solemnly.

Chu Han remained emotionless as he nodded his head, “It should be him.” His eyes turned bloodshot as he sneered, “New king of hell? When the time comes, I will let him become the new ghost of hell!”

The entire hall broke out in laughter.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong and the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin arrived in front of a huge black city.

Black Ant City stood before them in an imposing manner.

Even though the Black Ant City’s walls were completely dark, devoid of light, and didn’t have any runes on it, Huang Xiaolong could sense a suffocating aura coming from it. Furthermore, he could also sense a bloody aura lingering in the air.

Huang Xiaolong’s Eye of Hell opened as he peered into Black Ant City. He saw some round ball of flesh squirming and letting out a chilling sucking sound.

“Are those Ancient Blood Devil Leeches?!” Huang Xiaolong dug through his memories, and he felt a sense of extreme shock.

The Blood Devil Leech was a type of ancient Devil Bug that was able to attach itself to any living thing. Although it didn’t release any poison, it was able to suck the blood essence out of any living organism, and it could also absorb their soul.

It was in a way similar to the devouring power of Huang Xiaolong’s archdevil supreme godhead.

Moreover, the Blood Devil Leech was unafraid of being attacked as it would still be able to survive even if it was chopped into millions of pieces. Even Xiang Xun’s hellfire would fail to kill it.

Huang Xiaolong continued to observe Black Ant City, and he discovered a Blood Devil Leech stationed close to the first one. There were Blood Devil Leeches all around, and the weakest one was in the mid-level Heavenly Monarch Realm. The strongest of the leeches were in the Emperor Realm!

Even though the Blood Devil Leeches in the Heavenly Monarch Realm didn’t pose any threat to him, the Blood Devil Leeches that could advance into the Emperor Realm would be a terrifying existence.

Huang Xiaolong then explained the hidden situation to the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin’s expression changed drastically.

Hao Ren was clearly aware that it was exhausting to deal with a Blood Devil Leech. Let alone a stronger one, to kill one at his cultivation level would require a godforsaken amount of time.

“Didn’t the Blood Devil Leeches go extinct long ago? Why are they here in Black Ant City? How did Liao Yuan obtain them?!” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin frowned.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart quivered. Could it really be the Heaven Resentment Emperor?

After his careful observation, Huang Xiaolong noticed that underneath the Heaven Resentment Continent, there was an indistinct and faint mysterious energy affecting all the Blood Devil Leeches inside the Black Ant City.

It was extremely likely that this mysterious energy belonged to the Heaven Resentment Emperor.

“Your Majesty, should we not enter the city?” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin asked.

“No, we will directly kill our way into the Black Ant Clan headquarters inside the Black Ant City!” After saying that, his figure flashed and the two of them disappeared from the gates.

A few moments later, two figures appeared abruptly in the space above the Black Ant Clan headquarters.

Inside the Black Ant Clan headquarters in the north of the Black Ant City...

The headquarters stood tall inside Black Ant City, and from afar, it looked like an enormous black mountain that exuded an invisible pressure on everyone near it.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned cold as he looked at the Black Ant Clan headquarters. The City of Eternity appeared as a hundred of his Undead Puppets Netherguards appeared.

The City of Eternity enlarged itself and turned into a massive existence. Borrowing the strength of the hundred Netherguards, it smashed into the Black Ant Clan headquarters.

Boom!

It was as if the sky and earth had exploded, as the entire Black Ant City trembled violently.

Sounds of explosions sounded out continuously as the defensive restriction on top of the city walls cracked.

A bunch of figures flew out angrily from the Black Ant Clan headquarters.

The headquarters of the Black Ant Clan that towered over the city was instantly reduced to dust by the City of Eternity. Furthermore, the buildings, streets, and everything within several millions of miles of the headquarters were flattened.

At this moment, a terrifying force suddenly appeared behind Huang Xiaolong. Despite its might, it remained extremely silent. A long black arrow penetrated time and space, carrying along the power of world destruction, and attacked Huang Xiaolong from behind.

On top of the long black arrow were layers of dark runes that looked like they were formed when Hell itself had come into existence.

When the long black arrow attacked him, Huang Xiaolong’s felt an incoming sense of doom. Without turning around, he unleashed a sacred ray of light. The ray of light turned into the Heavenly Hall that welcomed the black arrow.

“Clang!”

The black colored arrow managed to pierce through the sacred light, and a hole appeared in the Heavenly Hall.

However, at the exact moment when the long black arrow clashed with the Heavenly Hall, the darkness energy contained in it, was instantly purified by the sacred ray of light surrounding the Heavenly Hall.

Another long black arrow flew towards Huang Xiaolong from the front after the first arrow was blocked by the Heavenly Hall.

From the looks of things, the black arrow was about to pierce through Huang Xiaolong.

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin finally snapped back to reality and its expression changed. It was impossible for it to stop the arrow to protect Huang Xiaolong. The destructive power contained in the arrow was something that surpassed Hao Ren by several hundred folds.

The City of Eternity and the Heavenly Hall wouldn’t be able to block it in time...
