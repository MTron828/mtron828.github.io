Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Even though Huang Xiaolong already knew that Cang Mutian possessed terrifying strength, he was shocked when he heard that Cang Mutian could pierce through space and create a tunnel directly to the Cursed Forest.

The distance from the Dragon Bear Valley to the Cursed Forest wasn’t short. They were separated by tens of billions of miles, and even if Huang Xiaolong used the Tushita Flying Ship, it would take him four to five days of traveling through the tunnel just to arrive at the periphery of the forest.

If they wanted to cross such a distance with a transmission array, it had to be a supreme transmission array.

However, Cang Mutian shocked them all by telling them that there wasn’t a need for a supreme transmission array. He was willing to use a part of his power to punch a tunnel through space for Huang Xiaolong and the others to move directly to the Cursed Forest.

The power he was about to display had already gone beyond Huang Xiaolong’s scope of imagination.

When Cang Mutian saw the look of surprise on Huang Xiaolong’s face, he chuckled in amusement. “There’s nothing for you to feel shocked about. With your talent, there will be a day where you will reach my level of cultivation. When that happens, you will be able to do something like that easily.”

Huang Xiaolong snapped back to attention, and he hesitated for a moment. “Senior Mutian, are you a high-level Sovereign?”

Cang Mutian used to be great friends with his master, the King of Hell. As such, Huang Xiaolong addressed him respectfully as ‘senior.’

“High-level Sovereign Realm... That’s a little too far off!” Cang Mutian shook his head.

Huang Xiaolong experienced another wave of shock. He wasn’t a high-level Sovereign!

Huang Xiaolong felt that for Cang Mutian to be able to force Shi Ming to retreat, he had to be at the high-level Sovereign Realm.

Cang Mutian raised his head and looked towards the sky. “According to what I know, there is only a single existence at the high-level Sovereign Realm in the myriad of worlds. It’s really too difficult to reach the high-level Sovereign Realm!”

Only a single existence in the myriad of worlds!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath.

It seemed as though reaching the high-level Sovereign Realm was harder than he had thought.

“The only reason I had managed to beat Shi Ming was because of the presence of True Dragon Mountain. I borrowed the strength of the stone platform and Dragon Bear Valley. Strictly speaking, Shi Ming isn’t too much weaker than me.” Cang Mutian warned. “When you meet Shi Ming in the future, you have to be careful.”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank a little, and he nodded his head.

Shi Ming!

A chilly light flashed through his eyes. He didn’t care how strong Shi Ming was, but he swore that Shi Ming would die at his hands!

“Senior Mutian, who is that person who is at the high-level Sovereign Realm?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but feel curious about the only person who had managed to achieve such a feat.

Could it be his master, the King of Grandmist? Or could it be some hidden super powerhouse?

Cang Mutian refused to reply and shook his head in silence.

Seeing that Cang Mutian was unwilling to speak of the matter, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t able to do anything about it.

Seeing that there was nothing left for Huang Xiaolong to do, Cang Mutian allowed Cang Yuanzong to give Huang Xiaolong the Heavenly Origin Stone before making preparations to punch a tunnel through space.

Even though Cang Mutian had horrifying strength, forming a space tunnel wasn’t something he could do in a short amount of time. He used a full day to prepare before opening the tunnel.

Eventually, a massive black hole appeared in the space above True Dragon Mountain.

With the black hole’s size, it wouldn’t have been a problem even if Huang Xiaolong wanted to bring several hundred people with him.

“Alright. You can enter now. Since there isn’t anything to stabilize it, this tunnel will only last for half a month. You will need to arrive there in half a month. Once the tunnel collapses, you will be swept away by the currents in space, and it would be difficult for you to return to the Devil World.” Cang Mutian gave Huang Xiaolong a final warning before he left.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “Junior understands.”

Without wasting more time, Huang Xiaolong, Gao Changran, Lu Xiaoqing, and the others entered the Tushita Flying Ship and entered the space tunnel.

Cang Mutian looked at the ship that was disappearing in his field of vision, and he sighed. “Three Supreme Godheads and three Archdevil bloodlines. How can such a perverse genius appear in our world?! Shi Ming is actually retarded for making him his enemy.”

“That’s right. I heard that Huang Xiaolong cultivated for less than a thousand years. How terrifying is that?” Cang Yuanzong exclaimed in surprise.

When Huang Xiaolong entered the space tunnel and made his way to the Cursed Forest, Cang Mutian’s existence was revealed to the world. The entire Devil World shook.

“What?! Cang Mutian?! Cang Mutian of the Heavenly Dragon Bear Race is still alive?!”

“There’s no mistake. I heard that the Dragon Bear Valley is located at the bottom of the cliff at the edge of the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire.”

“Who discovered the existence of the Dragon Bear Race and Cang Mutian?”

“I heard that the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s old ancestor, Shi Ming, Archdevil Ancestor Chiyou, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Chu Han, and Great Emperor Lan Chong made the discovery! They were hunting Huang Xiaolong down, and they arrived at the Dragon Bear Valley. Huang Xiaolong managed to hide in the valley, and I heard that Cang Mutian used a single arm to force the four of them to retreat! Chiyou, Chu Han, and Lan Chong experienced serious injuries, and they nearly left their lives behind at the Dragon Bear Valley!”

Some people were shocked, and some were amazed. All of them were trying to guess Cang Mutian’s actual strength, and the speculations of Huang Xiaolong’s relationship with the Heavenly Dragon Bear Race started.

It didn’t matter if it was the Devil Beast World or the nine empires. Even the Archdevil Ancestors started their investigation. Peak experts from other worlds also started to move when they heard the news of Cang Mutian’s existence.

To them, Cang Mutian and the Heavenly Dragon Bear Race could single-handedly change the structure of the Devil World.

As the world shook and trembled, Huang Xiaolong’s party traveled through the space tunnel, impervious to the changes that happened.

In five days, the Tushita Flying Ship left the spatial tunnel.

When Huang Xiaolong saw that they were in the air above the Cursed Forest, he took out the Heavenly Origin Stone. Sending some of his godforce into it, he covered the Tushita Flying Ship in a layer of light before charging straight into the Cursed Forest.

The moment they entered, Huang Xiaolong passed the control of the Tushita Flying Ship to the four odd beasts. Their speed increased, and they shot towards the north of the forest.

With the speed they were traveling at, Huang Xiaolong knew that they would soon arrive at the icy lake Lu Xiaoqing had mentioned.

Despite the short distance, a sense of unease appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. He was afraid that Shi Ming, Chiyou, and the others would pop out of nowhere.

It was fortunate that his worries were unfounded. They arrived at the northern part of the Cursed Forest without mishap.

When they arrived at their destination, they followed Lu Xiaoqing’s estimations, and Huang Xiaolong circulated the energy of the Blood Eye Devil Stele. He tried his best to locate the Myriad Curses Devil Stele.

“There!” Huang Xiaolong felt a familiar presence calling out to him, and he quickly called out the general direction. With the help of the Undying Race’s Netherguards and the four odd beasts, the ship accelerated and shot towards their destination.

As the feeling became stronger and stronger, a massive frozen lake appeared in their sights.

A feeling of joy spread through Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

They were finally there!

With the threat of Shi Ming, Chiyou, and the rest, it could be said that they had experienced an extremely perilous journey to locate the Myriad Curses Devil Stele.

Without getting out of the ship, Huang Xiaolong ordered them to descend into the lake. They broke through the ice on the surface and slowly made their way downwards.

The moment they arrived at the bottom of the lake, they were assaulted by waves of frigid qi.

They experienced the chill worse than what they had felt when they had stood on the cliff above Dragon Bear Valley.

Huang Xiaolong hastily retrieved the Heavenly Hall. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

While he did that, the Heavenly Origin Stone emitted resplendent rays of light and resisted the power of curses all around them.
