Chapter 2067: Great Killing Formation

Another year went by.

There was still no movement from the Complete Heaven Palace.

Inside the Complete Heaven Palace, Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded in glistening light as if he had turned into a sparkling star.

Waves of tyrannical energy surged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Every wave of this energy could easily injure the weaker Sovereign Realm experts. Huang Xiaolong’s tyrannical energy was continuously dispersing the surrounding stars’ energy. These stars’ energy regrouped again after being dispersed.

If the Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist, and the others were inside the Complete Heaven Palace, they would see that Huang Xiaolong had already advanced to the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. Following the rhythm of Huang Xiaolong’s breathing, his many different elements of supreme godforce began undergoing shocking changes. This was one of the indications that one’s cultivation had entered the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

After stepping into the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, Huang Xiaolong’s godforce began to harmonize with the surrounding origin energy of heaven and earth. From thereon, his godforce would gradually evolve towards origin force.

However, the transformation of Huang Xiaolong’s godforce into origin force would only be complete after breaking through to the Sovereign Realm.

Not only in terms of godforce, even Huang Xiaolong’s physical body and godheads, as well as his Emperor’s will, were evolving.

Whether it was Huang Xiaolong’s body, or godheads, or his Emperor’s will, all these aspects seemed to melt into heaven and earth, becoming a part of it.

After breaking through to Sovereign Realm, Huang Xiaolong’s physical body would have been completely reformed by the origin energy into a physique of origin that would be stronger. It would be stronger to the point where a grandmist treasure artifact also wouldn’t be able to injure Huang Xiaolong. The same was true for his godheads.

Huang Xiaolong’s Emperor’s will chaos ax was now twice as big. It was sharper and more resilient.

It was not an exaggeration to say that after stepping into the Sovereign Realm, Huang Xiaolong’s Emperor’s will’s little chaos ax would be deadlier than many grandmist treasure artifacts.

This was because even though ordinary grandmist treasure artifacts couldn’t injure Sovereign Realm experts’ physique of origin, Huang Xiaolong’s little chaos ax, condensed out from his Emperor’s will, could easily kill an early First Order Sovereign!

Not to mention, First Order Sovereign, it could even kill the Second Order, and Third Order Sovereign!

No doubt, once Huang Xiaolong would break through to the Sovereign Realm, it would no longer be the Emperor’s will but a Sovereign’s will.

While refining the Nine Orifices Soul Fruit in front of him, streams of origin energy from the Nine Orifices Soul Fruit flowed out continuously into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The Nine Orifices Soul Fruit was a high-level-two origin treasure. It was one of two high-level-two origin treasures amongst the six level-two origin treasures. In comparison to low-level-two and mid-level-two origin treasures, the Nine Orifices Soul Fruit contained a higher amount of origin energy that was even purer.

Huang Xiaolong continued to absorb origin energy, continuously tempering his godforce within his three king of supreme godheads.

Under the origin energy’s continuous tempering, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation inched closer to the pinnacle of peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm every day.

Reaching this point, Huang Xiaolong began suppressing his breakthrough. After all, this was not an ideal time or circumstances to advance to Sovereign Realm.

Another half a year passed, the Nine Orifices Soul Fruit was reduced into a group of golden mists that dissipated as Huang Xiaolong finished absorbing its origin energy.

Looking at the remaining high-level-two origin treasure, Huang Xiaolong hesitated. In the end, he decided against refining at that moment. At his current pinnacle peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm cultivation, he could already attempt to breakthrough to Sovereign Realm. However, he decided to wait and step into Sovereign Realm in the Radiance Flames Volcano before refining this Nine Dao Thistle.

Huang Xiaolong put away the Nine Dao Thistle and exited the Complete Heaven Palace.

“The pinnacle of peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm!” The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared, the King of Grandmist, little cow, Reverence Moon Old Man, and the others exclaimed in astonishment when they noticed his cultivation. Although they had made general estimation about Huang Xiaolong’s improvement during this time’s seclusion, there were waves of shock in their hearts after seeing that Huang Xiaolong had reached the pinnacle of peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

“Xiaolong, those level one and level two origin treasures, did you refine all of them?” Cang Mutian asked weakly.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head before Cang Mutian could heave in relief. Huang Xiaolong took out the Nine Dao Thistle and said, “There’s this Nine Dao Thistle left.”

Cang Mutian, Du Hai, and the others nearly collapsed then and there.

“Master, did anything of significance happen during my thirty-plus years of seclusion?” Huang Xiaolong then proceeded to ask about the affairs of Hell, Demon World, Divine World, and the Radiance World.

“Everything is well.” The King of Grandmist answered, but his tone took a turn as he added, “But this is also the problem. It’s too calm that it’s making us uneasy.”

“I have been having a nagging feeling of unease for quite some time now.” Reverence Moon Old Man’s gaze turned deep. “The City of All-Heavens’ moves are strange.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What’s there to be afraid of? As long as Wan Shi does not appear, there’s nothing to worry about.” The little cow fumed. “Let them send whatever they have. Now that Xiaolong has reached the pinnacle of peak late-Tenth Order Emperor, and there are still eighteen years left, he should be able to break through to the Sovereign Realm. Wait till Xiaolong becomes a Sovereign. We will have even fewer things to be fearful of.”

Reverence Moon Old Man shook his head, stressing, “Though all of us think so, we still need to exercise caution and make the necessary preparations. How about this? Each of us will try to contact the Sovereigns that we know. There’s safety in numbers.”

“Alright!” The little cow, King of Grandmist, and the others nodded in agreement.

A few days later, Huang Xiaolong appeared in the inner peripheral region of Reverence Moon Academy’s forbidden land and stood in front of the Radiance Flame Volcano.

Two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels he had sent into the Radiance Flame Volcano had yet to come out.

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong leaped into the Radiance Flame Volcano.

While Huang Xiaolong disappeared into the volcano’s mouth, at the City of All-Heavens, Wan Yue was seated in the main seat inside the All-Heavens Palace’s main hall. A group of Sovereign Realm experts was gathered before him. Apart from Old Monster Lun Zhuan, Old Crow Ancestor, Shi Ming, and the others, there were four old men with domineering bearing. They were exuding the obvious auras of Sovereigns.

One amongst these four old men hailed from the Ghost World, which was one of the pillars of Hell’s ancient clans’ alliance. He was the Scorpio Clan’s Old Ancestor, Chen Fushan. After the little cow had crushed the ancient clans’ alliance, most ancient clans’ members were killed, but Chen Fushan managed to escape.

The other three were old monsters from the same generation as the King of Grandmist. Earlier, they had also formed an alliance to hinder Jiang Hong, but they were beaten to a retreat when the little cow had brought reinforcements to Jiang Hong’s side.

Wan Yue beamed at the present Sovereign Realm experts and said, “The Great Killing Formation has been completed. Now, we just need to wait for the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness to ripen. As long as Huang Xiaolong dares to show up, he won’t be able to escape!”

The Scorpio Old Ancestor Chen Fushan was gritting his teeth in hatred, “Old Ancestor Azure Cow’s group destroyed my ancient clans’ alliance and killed several hundred billions of my Scorpio Clan’s disciples. The hatred in my heart won’t be appeased unless I kill them!”

The Divine World’s three old monsters were also exuding overwhelming anger and hatred from their bodies.

Wan Yue maintained his smile as he reassured them, “Rest assured, everyone. This time, we aim to deal with Huang Xiaolong first. When my father comes out from seclusion, Old Ancestor Azure Cow, Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist—not one of them will be spared!”
