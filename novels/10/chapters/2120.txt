Chapter 2121: Great Purity Secret Art

Wan Yue and the others saw Wan Shi being beaten back by Huang Xiaolong, and a trace of fear flashed in their eyes. When they saw the terrifying wound on Wan Shi’s chest, they sucked in a cold breath.

Huang Xiaolong defeated the unrivaled Wan Shi?!

Even with the Myriad Worlds Bamboo to protect him, Wan Shi was sent flying by a single punch from Huang Xiaolong!

Wan Shi stared at Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous look on his face. In his mind, his father was a majestic mountain whom he had awlays looked up to with admiration and respect. There were no experts in the world who could stand against his father, and he was the strongest individual in the myriad of worlds! Now...

When he stared at the blood flowing from Wan Shi’s chest wound, the look in Wan Yue’s eyes turned sluggish, and he felt his world flipping upside down.

After he sent Wan Shi flying, Huang Xiaolong didn’t follow up. The first thing he did was to capture Wan Yue. The most important thing to Huang Xiaolong was to obtain his senior brother’s godhead.

When Huang Xiaolong dragged Wan Yue before him, a sense of unprecedented fear filled his heart.

“Huang... Huang... Huang Xiaolong...” Wan Yue stuttered, and he failed to form a proper sentence.

“You definitely didn’t think that this day will come when you killed my senior brother...” Huang Xiaolong looked him in the eye and said coldly.

Wan Yue could feel the murderous intent leaking out from Huang Xiaolong, and he didn’t dare to let out so much as a fart. The blood drained from his face.

“Where is my senior brother’s godhead?!” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother torturing Wan Yue, and he asked the question without the slightest hesitation.

Wan Yue fell into a daze as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When a frigid light shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, Wan Yue finally snapped back to attention as he stammered, “It’s... It’s in the All-Heavens Treasury!”

All-Heavens Treasury!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know how to react for a moment when he heard how Wan Yue had stored his senior brother’s godhead in the All-Heavens Treasury.

The All-HeavensTreasury was the number one treasury under the heavens! Since the City of All-Heavens stood at the peak of the myriad of worlds, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to see the All-Heavens Treasury for himself to know that its contents were a notch above the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s treasury!

Before Huang Xiaolong could question Wan Yue further, a shocking aura emerged from Wan Shi’s body as he gradually got to his feet.

The hole in his chest was patched up with rays of green light as his flesh quickly regenerated.

Seeing that Wan Shi was back in action, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered with Wan Yue. He filled Wan Yue’s body with restrictions before throwing him into one of the random palaces in the Ancient Heavenly Court. With Wan Yue in his hands, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid that he wouldn’t be able to find Jiang Hong’s godhead. The thing he had to do now was to deal with Wan Shi.

As soon as Wan Shi got to his feet, the killing intent leaking out from his body pierced through the skies. A chilly light flashed in his eyes as he growled, “This is the first time... The first time anyone has managed to injure me.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Should I be feeling proud of myself?”

Wan Shi roared with laughter, but there was a trace of savagery hidden behind his sudden outburst. Killing intent laced his words as all the air around the city started to boil. Those experts who had managed to run away could feel the change in the atmosphere, and they felt as though explosions were booming through their minds.

“You should be proud... That’s because you will die today, and your death will be a brutal one!” Wan Shi stopped laughing all of a sudden, and he roared towards the heavens. “Do you really think that no one will be able to defeat you just because of the defensive layer from your saint bloodline?! Are you so confident that I won’t be able to break it?! Let me show you right now. I’ll shatter your defense and tear your flesh from your bones!”

A mysterious light emerged from Wan Shi’s body after he spoke. This mysterious light seemed a little like chaos qi, but it was different. It was a little stronger compared to grandmist qi, and it emitted a faint mysterious yellow light.

Looking at the weird light flowing out from Wan Shi’s body, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but frown. “Great Purity qi?!” He knew that Wan Shi had comprehended the Great Purity Secret Art during his time in seclusion.

Wan Shi sneered, and he looked extremely proud of himself. “That’s right. It’s the Great Purity qi! With this, I can forcefully transform everything back into chaos and the five elements. So what if you possess a saint bloodline?!”

“Right now, you are the first person to have a taste of my Great Purity Secret Art!”

The Great Purity qi around his body transformed into countless weapons as they shot towards Huang Xiaolong. They possessed extreme speed and impressive combat strength. Even someone like Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but turn serious.

He didn’t dare to receive Wan Shi’s attack. With the shake of his body, Huang Xiaolong dodged the weapons that were flying at him. When they landed at the spot Huang Xiaolong was in, the earth disintegrated as it turned into streams of chaos energy.

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils constricted when he stared at the sight before him.

Wan Shi snorted, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you managed to dodge my attack?” The Grand Purity qi around his body expanded and enveloped the City of All-Heavens.

When the Heavenly Spirit Beast Master, Old Crow Ancestor, and the others realized what was happening, they started to escape.

As soon as they started to move, the Great Purity qi around the city fell like rain and crashed into the earth.

Buzz!

The earth under the city emitted Great Purity qi as radiance filled the lands. As the Great Purity qi transformed everything into earth qi, everything in the city started to disintegrate.

When the Heavenly Spirit Beast Master and the others realized that there was no way of escaping, a look of despair filled their faces. They had just witnessed the might of the Great Purity Art when Wan Shi had unleashed it against Huang Xiaolong previously. There was no way they could survive if they were hit by it.

As the Great Purity qi swallowed everything in its path, everything returned to chaos.

Even the grandmist artifacts and grandmist treasures on the ground transformed back into chaos energy streams.

The Great Purity qi swallowed everything in its path.

Even an early-Eighth Order Sovereign like Wan Shi found it hard to sustain the power of the Great Purity Art.

Looking at the destruction he had caused, Wan Shi nodded his head in content, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re definitely dead now...”

He found it a pity that he couldn’t capture Huang Xiaolong alive to dig out the secrets in his body.

Whatever the case, he felt a sense of relief that it was all over. At last, Huang Xiaolong, the biggest problem that was bugging him, was dead.

As for whether or not the Old Crow Ancestor and the others had died, Wan Shi didn’t give half a sh*t.

Several minutes later, the light emitted by the Great Purity qi finally dissipated, and everything regained its calm. The City of All-Heavens that stretched on for billions of miles was reduced into nothingness. Not even dust remained. A void appeared where the city stood as streams of chaos qi swirled about.

Those old freaks, who had managed to escape as soon as the battle had started, felt their scalps going numb when they saw the extent of damage the City of All-Heavens suffered.

Huh?! Wan Shi’s heart shook as the smile on his face hardened. He stared at a lightning bead that was flickering in the empty void before him and realized that something was very wrong.

This...?

A figure slowly appeared under the lightning bead.

Huang Xiaolong!

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong?!” Wan Shi’s expression sank as a look of disbelief appeared on his face.
