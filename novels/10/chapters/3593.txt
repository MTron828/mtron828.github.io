Chapter 3594 – Don’t Go Too Far

Could the two lords of Sentient Mountain Range also be in the city?

Jin Shi and the other two frowned.

Thinking about the possibility, they stopped the army from approaching the manor. Cupping their fists, they slowly approached. “Are fellow cultivators from the Sentient Mountain Range?”

The two lords of the Sentient Mountain Range were no weaklings. One of them was at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, and the other was at the peak of the small completion stage. Jin Shi didn’t dare to show them any disrespect.

Even so, they didn’t get a reply.

Jin Shi stared at the manor in silence.

Just as Qin Feng and Bai Zhou were about to speak up, a voice came from inside the manor. “Take all the ghost corpses and scram! Oh right, leave behind all your creation-level herbs and pills. If you have universe-level spiritual veins, hand them over. Put your weapons down along with any creation pills you have before leaving.”

?!

His voice was firm, and there was no denying it. He was serious.

Jin Shi and the others were slightly taken aback, but rage filled their hearts the next instant.

“Who the hell are you?! Why would you pretend to be from the Sentient Mountain Range?! Who do you think you are? How dare you ask us to leave our treasures before leaving?!” Jin Shi roared.

Initially, they wanted to be courteous to the lords of the Sentient Mountain Range. However, they didn’t think that the other party would start with such an unreasonable request! The way he spoke was nothing short of disrespectful.

However, they wouldn’t dare to make any rash moves as they had no idea how strong Huang Xiaolong was.

Jin Chengguang and the experts on his side noticed the abnormality, and they also heard what he said. None of them believed what they were hearing.

“What if we refuse?” Qin Feng snorted in anger.

“I strongly advise you to follow what I say. If you refuse, you won’t be able to leave even if you want to.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the skies.

Qin Feng’s temper was never great, and the axe in his hand cleaved downwards at the manor once Huang Xiaolong was done. With 3.2 billion units of grand cosmos energy powering it, the giant axe tore through the void as it appeared above the main structure. Just as it was about to break the manor in half, an ordinary looking arm appeared. He flicked his fingers once, and the giant axe was sent flying. The power behind the strike rebounded instantly.

Clang!

A clear ringing sound rang in the ears of those present in the city.

Under the gazes of Jin Chengguang, Wei Long, and the others, the axe flew through the air and Qin Feng was sent tumbling through the air like a shooting star.

No one knew how many ghost corpses he smashed into, but he created a giant crater when he finally landed.

Boom!

The city shook as various structures fell. A cloud of dust filled the air.

Everyone felt their jaws dropping in fright.

Jin Shi and Bai Zhou sucked in a long breath.

Qin Feng was the strongest among the three, and he had been in the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm the longest. Jin Shi had barely broken through, and he had 3 billion units of grand cosmos energy. As for Bai Zhou, there wasn’t much to say since he hadn’t entered the large completion stage.

The strongest among them, Qin Feng, was sent flying with a single flick!

In fact, none of them knew that that was merely one ten thousandth of Huang Xiaolong’s actual strength. No… That might even be an overestimation. If Huang Xiaolong used any more strength, Qin Feng would have exploded into a mist of blood.

With Huang Xiaolong’s 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy, half-step Universe Gods were nothing more than trash! Not to mention a mere God of Creation at the large completion stage.

Vomiting mouthfuls of blood, Qin Feng felt his entire arm going numb. There was no feeling in his arm that held the axe, and terror assaulted his mind.

The entire city fell silent in an instant. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The ghost corpse army that was killing to their heart’s content froze on the spot, and so did Jin Chengguang and the marshals. They stopped whatever they were doing and they forgot that they were surrounded by million and million of ghost corpses.

Jin Shi stuttered after some time, “I wonder which lord graced the Golden Sea City with your presence… We apologize for offending you! We’ll call the army back immediately!” As soon as he spoke, he called for a full scale retreat.

Like a receding tide, the ghost corpse army left the city as quickly as they came.

Jin Chengguang and the others heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the army leaving.

Before Jin Shi and Bai Zhou could leave with their army, a figure emerged from inside the amnor.

When they saw Huang Xiaolong’s young appearance, they were shocked.

With his hands clasped behind his back, Huang Xiaolong looked at Jin Shi and the others. “You seem to have forgotten whatever I said.”

Their expression turned completely unsightly.

As Gods of Creation, they definitely had creation pills and creation-level herbs on them. However, they only managed to obtain those treasures after a lot of effort. As for their creation artifact, it was something they would never part with.

Their creation artifact was what Gods of Creation treasured the most!

“Lord, we can give you everything other than our artifacts… After all…” Jin Shi hesitated for a moment.

Huang Xiaolong was completely expressionless and he muttered, “I gave you a chance and you refused to take it. Now, I want the treasuries of your respective factions!”

Their expressions changed once again.

The treasuries of their factions contained wealth accumulated after countless generations! Now, Huang Xiaolong wanted all of it!

“You’re going too far!” Jin Shi raged, “Don’t even think about it!”

Bai Zhou continued, “Let me tell you something, we have a great relationship with Lord Zhang Yun! Don’t push us too far!”

Zhang Yun was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage in the Limitless Land, and he had 7 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He was extremely famous throughout the lands!
