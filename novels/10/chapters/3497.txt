Chapter 3498: Leading Disciple

When Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at the library, they saw countless people waiting outside. There were nearly three thousand applicants, and all of them seemed pretty confident.

Lu Qianqian’s arrival brought about a commotion in the crowd.

“Teacher Lu Qianqian!”

Many people waved to Lu Qianqian, and Huang Xiaolong and the others could see how important she was in the hearts of those from the Submerged Dragon Institution.

It seemed as though the treatment of beauties were different everywhere…

However, Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover Shen Shijie in the crowd. He was among a group of core disciples and they stood behind another teacher in the Submerged Dragon Institution. Even though they were in the crowd, the teacher he stood behind had a dignified look. He stood out even in the massive crowd.

When they saw Lu Qianqian’s arrival, Shen Shijie and the other disciples swarmed her. Their teacher stood at the very front.

“Teacher Lu Qianqian.” He greeted her with a brilliant smile on his face.

“Teacher Shen Dong.” Lu Qianqian nodded politely.

There were several teachers in the institution at the peak of the Dao Venerable Realm, and Shen Dong was one of them.

He chuckled happily, “Are you here to try out for the position of the librarian too?”

Regardless of who they were, everyone was eligible to sign up. After all, the position of a librarian was one with no obligations!

Lu Qianqian shook her head. “No. I brought several friends over for the position.”

Shen Dong’s gaze paused slightly when he saw Wang Meiqi, but he soon turned back to Lu Qianqian. “Teacher Lu, I heard from my nephew that he had a run-in with your friends. I apologize on their behalf.”

Huang Xiaolong and the others remained silent.

However, Lu Qianqian shook her head and sighed, “Teacher Shen, you can apologize to my foster father personally. There’s no need to apologize to me.”

Staring at her in shock, he soon regained his composure. “I will.”

Shen Shijie was someone from the Shen Family, and they were one of the peak families in the Star Dragon Universe. The old ancestor of the Shen Family was an important figure in the Submerged Dragon Institute, and he was someone nearing the grand perfection level of the God of Creation Realm. As such, even Lu Qianqian had to be courteous when dealing with him.

After all, the person who offended Pangu and the others the day before was Shen Shijie, not Shen Dong.

After chatting with him for a little while, she brought Huang Xiaolong and the others over to register.

The originally crowded hall made way for Lu Qianqian the moment she appeared.

Huang Xiaolong and the others quickly registered themselves.

Naturally, passing the test wasn’t difficult for experts at their level. All six of them were at the God of Creation Realm, and all they had to do was to walk to the top of the sixth story in a day. Every single floor consisted of a great world, and the moment they ascended all six levels, they would pass the test.

Of course, the test was a near-impossible task for everyone else.

It had been several months, but no one managed to pass.

After all, there were countless restrictions on each floor, and the further they got, the stronger the restrictions became. It was difficult for the applicants to break the restrictions in the end.

Of course, there were no restrictions in the library itself, but there were countless books that could absorb the natural spiritual energy in the air. They developed their own consciousness, and the restrictions were laid down by the book spirits.

Several stronger spirits were comparable to experts who comprehended all thirteen elements. It was especially so for the sixth level, where even teachers of the institution wouldn’t be able to advance an inch. Even a year wouldn’t be enough for them to cross the sixth level.

As such, one could pass the test as soon as one reached the end of the sixth level. If one couldn’t reach the end of the library, what was the point of being a librarian?

After Huang Xiaolong and the others registered, Huang Xiaolong was the first to enter the library.

A light flashed in Shen Dong’s eyes when he saw Huang Xiaolong entering the library. He turned to Shen Shijie and asked, “Have you investigated their background?”

“We are unable to discover anything. All we know is that they lived in the Bearded Dragon City for some time. Moreover, we are unable to find out anything about Lu Qianqian’s foster father.”

“Oh.” Shen Dong was slightly taken aback.

“Second Uncle, do you think Lu Qianqian’s foster father is…”

God of Creation!

Shen Dong shook his head. “Even though he’s her foster father, he might not be a God of Creation.”

Shen Shijie looked at Huang Xiaolong’s back and sneered, “That brat is Lu Qianqian’s foster father’s direct disciple. It’s no wonder she’s treating him so well.”

Shen Dong’s eyes narrowed slightly.

As the greatest beauty of the Submerged Dragon Institute, Dong Sheng was one of her suitors.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“If he wishes to chase her, he will have to gain the qualifications. Let’s see if he manages to pass the test,” Shen Dong sneered.

“Not even teachers in the institute can pass the test. He’s just a nameless brat who came out of nowhere. He won’t be able to emerge after ten years.” Shen Shijie snorted.

Shen Dong smiled, and he didn’t say anything.

Lu Qianqian looked at the exit of the first level as she wanted to see if Huang Xiaolong could actually finish the test in a single day.

…

When Huang Xiaolong entered the library, he didn’t hurry to reach the end. However, every step he took caused the entire library to tremble. He would shatter the restrictions around him wherever he walked.

As such, no restrictions stood in his way.

Each level in the library was boundless, and one couldn’t see the end. Even so, Huang Xiaolong reached the end after three short minutes.

Of course, he was controlling his speed.

When he arrived at the second level, he started to make his way to the end. It was clear that the restrictions on the second level were stronger than the first, but they were nothing to Huang Xiaolong. Several stronger spirits tried to attack him, but he suppressed them the instant he released the slightest bit of his aura. All of them were forced to the ground whenever he passed them.

Next came the third, fourth, and fifth stories!

In a matter of minutes, Huang Xiaolong arrived on the sixth story!

The skies were crimson, and frosty qi filled the lands. Demonic flames burned in the space around him, and countless mirages entered Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. A terrifying pressure charged at Huang Xiaolong.

Step by step, Huang Xiaolong advanced to the end.

Several minutes later…

The hall outside the library burst into another round of commotion.

“It’s Senior Brother Shan Fei! Is he here to register to become a librarian too?!” someone screamed.

A youngster with an unusually large head entered the hall as cheers filled the place.

Shan Fei!

He was the leading disciple of the Submerged Dragon Institution!

He wasn’t just the disciple with the greatest talent, but he was also the strongest disciple in the younger generation!

Even Lu Qianqian was taken aback when she saw his arrival. Even though he was a student in the institute, his status was higher than many teachers! He managed to accumulate 1.2 billion units of grand cosmos energy in several million years!
