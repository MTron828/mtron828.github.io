Make trouble? Hearing Wang Zhe accusing him of making trouble pushed Huang Xiaolong’s patience over the edge. A sharp gleamed flitted across his eyes.

Noticing this, Wang Zhe mocked, “What? Want to fight?”

Wang Zhe was aware that Huang Xiaolong was no weakling, however, he was a long standing Elder of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. Even though his alchemy refining skills were lackluster compared to Huang Xiaolong’s, his own cultivation wasn’t bad.

He was a peak late-Seventh Order Highgod Realm master, which was why he believed that Huang Xiaolong was no match for him in terms of strength.

Huang Xiaolong’s tone turned icy, “You will regret this very soon.” He then turned and left. In a brief moment before Huang Xiaolong left the square, he sent an unnoticeable line of frigid force into Wang Zhe’s body.

When he was passing by Mo Su, Huang Xiaolong gave him a disdainful glance before looking away.

Mo Su was already fuming after knowing that Huang Xiaolong actually refined those tribulation grade Divine Essence Pellets. Adding on that disdainful glance, the anger he had been reigning in exploded.

“Huang Xiaolong, stop right there for this Devil Son!” Mo Su bellowed, his fist already striking out at Huang Xiaolong’s back.

“Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul-locking Fist!”

In the next moment, devil qi surged high like a tsunami, enveloping heaven and earth in darkness.

Nefarious howling ghost heads appeared, locking onto Huang Xiaolong.

Those ghost heads condensed from Mo Su’s devil qi formed a giant fist with devil symbols swirling around it that covered Huang Xiaolong.

Mo Su was already a peak late-Eighth Order Highgod Realm after he exited the Hellion Tower, and the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul-locking Fist was one of the ancient devil clan’s supreme techniques, the momentum of this combination made even the masters watching from the edge of the square palpitate.

Just as everyone watching thought that Huang Xiaolong would be vomiting blood after being struck by Mo Su’s sudden attack, Huang Xiaolong spun around, striking out a palm attack of his own in counter.

The Earthen Buddha Palm!

There were no other techniques such as the Godly Xumi Art incorporated into Huang Xiaolong’s attack. It was a straightforward Earthen Buddha Palm that was used to counter Mo Su’s attack.

In a split second, the palm and fist collided. Tremors passed under the crowd’s feet and their ears buzzed from the booming collision. The seemingly powerful Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul-locking Fist exploded in the air; all ten thousand ghost heads scattered like dust and Mo Su himself tumbled in the air like a broken kite, crashing heavily. It did not stop there though. His body rolled until the edge of the square, miserably lying there.

Blood was flowing from Mo Su’s mouth like it wasn’t worth a penny.

The crowd was stupefied, sucking in a breath of cold air as their senses returned.

Wang Zhe felt his heartstrings twitch, he hadn’t expected Mo Su to end up so embarrassing. After all, he was a peak late-Eighth Order Highgod Realm master, not only had his sneak attack failed, he was even sent flying by Huang Xiaolong!

Cold sweat trickled down Wang Zhe’s back remembering that he had just taunted Huang Xiaolong moments ago. Had Huang Xiaolong really acted just now...!

Goosebumps ran down Wang Zhe’s neck imagining the worst possibility.

Huang Xiaolong spared no glance at the figure that had rolled to the edge of the square. He turned and left with astonished gazes following him.

The devil clan masters were enraged, but just as they wanted to encircle Huang Xiaolong, their impulsive actions were stopped by Elder Mo Zhenru.

Mo Zhenru watched as Huang Xiaolong left the square, making no move to stop him.

Not long after he left the square, another light flickered and a figure stepped out from one of the isolated chambers, Wangu Ye. When he stepped out from his chamber, the first thing he saw was Mo Su lying in a puddle of his own blood, something that genuinely shocked him.

In a few short moments, he inwardly summarized what happened to Mo Su from the noisy crowd, which caused his shock to multiply.

Huang Xiaolong did this!

A peak late-Eighth Order Highgod Realm Mo Su was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong with a single palm strike!

This...!

‘This matter must be reported to the Patriarch at the earliest!’ Wangu Ye noted, still feeling shocked in his heart.

Although their Wangu Clan had a friendly stance towards their association with Huang Xiaolong, it wasn’t to the point of publicly standing on Huang Xiaolong’s side in the matter against the Fortune Gate. But now, in Wangu Ye’s eyes, it seemed their clan would need to reevaluate their stance towards Huang Xiaolong.

Some time later, Mo Su regained consciousness after Mo Zhenru treated his injuries.

At this time, another light flickered from the direction of the refining chambers and a young woman walked out. She was dressed entirely in white, including the thin veil that covered her face yet was unable to conceal her beauty.

Seeing this young woman, one of the devil clan disciples whispered into Mo Su’s ears: “Devil Son, that’s the Fortune Gate’s Li Lu.”

Li Lu!

Hearing this, Mo Su quickly turned to look, desire shining in the depth of his eyes. But that dissipated just as quickly. Mo Su barked an order to the devil clan disciples around him: “We’re leaving!”

If it was any other time, Mo Su would have approach Li Lu and attempted to strike a conversation, but right now, he was wounded by Huang Xiaolong, blood stains all over his robe. How embarrassing he appeared right now!

He then turned and left without another word. Inwardly, his killing intent towards Huang Xiaolong soared higher and higher.

On another side, Huang Xiaolong was back in the Sun Moon Residence.

In his yard, Huang Xiaolong circulated his four divine fires, absorbing the shimmering gray energy until three days later when the preliminary round would end and he would return to the square for the next round.

In the next round, the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s twelve Eminent Elders would be present.

Even if Sun Yi and Jiang Lei’s Master, Jiang Bi, wanted to make trouble for him, they couldn’t use underhanded tricks. Hence, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried about it.

While he was cultivating in his Sun Moon Residence, within one of the many courtyards of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, Sun Yi had been waiting for news when he saw Wang Zhe walking in. Not waiting for Wang Zhe to speak, Sun Yi already asked, “Is the result of Huang Xiaolong’s preliminary round out?”

Sun Yi had instructed Wang Zhe to report to him once Huang Xiaolong’s result was known.

Yet Wang Zhe’s head was so low that his forehead was about to stick to his chest. He dared not look at Sun Yi. “Huang Xiaolong, he, he passed the preliminary round.”

“What did you say?” Sun Yi, as well as Liu Hao standing behind him, thought they had misheard Wang Zhe.

Wang Zhe cautiously took half a step forward, offering a bottle containing one of the tribulation grade Divine Essence Pellets that Huang Xiaolong had refined, explaining, “This is one of the Divine Essence Pellets refined by him using thirty-two minutes and fifty seconds.”

Sun Yi grabbed the bottle from Wang Zhe’s hands and wiped away the restriction. A round Divine Essence Pellet floated into the air, emitting a refreshing herb fragrance.

Tribulation grade Divine Essence Pellet!

Both Sun Yi and Liu Hao looked as flabbergasted as they felt, brimming with disbelief.

“This is the refining chamber’s recording.” Wang Zhe then handed over a monitoring bead obtained from the formation to Sun Yi, who imbued godforce into it.

Half an hour later, he finished watching the entire process of Huang Xiaolong refining Divine Essence Pellet, looking extremely solemn by the end.

“Eminent Elder Sun, I, I still need to oversee the remaining participants. Y-you see, may I...?” Wang Zhe cautiously sought permission. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Sun Yi waved his hand, “Alright, your business is done here. Return to your duty.”

Wang Zhe was inwardly relieved, but on the surface, he respectfully bowed to Sun Yi and retreated. However, before leaving, as an afterthought, Wang Zhe decided to report to Sun Yi how Huang Xiaolong sent Mo Su flying with a single strike.

Listening to Wang Zhe’s report, Sun Yi and Liu Hai couldn’t hide the astonishment from their faces. Until Wang Zhe’s figure disappeared, the master and disciple duo were still standing in the same spot, barely moving an inch.

A long, long time later, Sun Yi mumbled under his breath, “Even the Eighth Order Highgod Realm Mo Su wasn’t his match? It appears that we must absolutely not allow Huang Xiaolong to leave the Divine Dan City no matter what!”

As Sun Yi was saying this, a whelming murderous aura froze the air in his immediate proximity.

The news of Huang Xiaolong successfully refining tribulation grade Divine Essence Pellets during the preliminary round spread throughout the Divine Dan City like wildfire. Every corner of the city was filled with exclamations of awe, shock, and astonishment. Naturally, the incident of Mo Su sneaking an attack on Huang Xiaolong but was sent flying with single a palm strike also spread through the city at rapid speed.

In the blink of an eye, two days came and went.

Huang Xiaolong stepped out from his manor. Tomorrow was the day of the semi-final round, but for unknown reasons, his heart seemed unable to calm down. In fact, it was a downright feeling of unease as if something bad was about to happen.

Unable to calm his heart to cultivate, Huang Xiaolong decided to take a stroll outside, inquiring about the latest news around the Divine Dan City while replenishing some Celestial Blossom Wine.
