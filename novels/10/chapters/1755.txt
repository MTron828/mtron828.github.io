After Huang Xiaolong finished speaking, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship immediately turned into a streak of light as it tore through space and disappeared from Chen Yirong, Fang Mingyu, and the others’ sight.

“Mingyu, what do you think his ranking will be this time around?” Chen Yirong asked with a complicated expression on his face. Naturally, he was referring to Huang Xiaolong.

Fang Mingyu shook his head and muttered, “It shouldn’t be difficult for him to get into the top ten. As for the top three... I heard the news recently that some of the Heavenly Court’s participating princes have already broken through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm thousands of years ago. Moreover, even the Fiend God’s disciples are participating this time around, and their strength could be said to be formidable. And there is even one disciple who is acclaimed as the most talented genius since the founding of the Fiend God Emperor Palace, and is said to be even more talented than the Fiend God himself.”

“Moreover, some people say that the Heavenly Court’s Heavenly Prince has the number one divine physique. Others also say that the young master of the Fiend God Emperor Palace has an Archdevil bloodline completely different than Sun Shihai’s.”

Fang Mingyu added, “As for the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Li Junhua, even though he isn’t as talented as the Heavenly Prince or the young master from the Fiend God Emperor Palace, his strength isn’t that far off from the two of them. He reached the Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm long ago. Moreover, the young master of the Brightness Emperor Palace is not inferior to anyone of them.”

Fang Mingyu stopped himself.

Even though he didn’t say it clearly, his words indirectly implied that Huang Xiaolong would not get into the top three.

The Heavenly Prince from the Heavenly Court, the young master of the Fiend God Emperor Palace and Brightness Emperor Palace!

And there was still the supreme genius from the Grandmist Emperor Palace, Li Junhua! Amongst the disciples from Grandmist Emperor Palace, his talent was second to their young master.

Besides the four of them, there were still many talented disciples from various Emperor Palaces and hidden races.

“What a pity that one is unable to rely on external forces in the Battle of The Heavenly Court...” Chen Yirong lamented.

“That’s unfortunate indeed. Even though Huang Xiaolong has a king of supreme godhead, his cultivation time is too short.” Fang Mingyu sighed, “He has barely cultivated for a thousand years while the Heavenly Prince and the various young masters have cultivated for tens of thousands of years. However, even though his cultivation time is short, his combat strength should have already reached the mid-Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, right?”

He recalled the scene where Huang Xiaolong had severely injured a grand elder at the peak of the mid-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch from the Piercing Moon Sect in Nightless City.

“What? Huang Xiaolong’s actual strength is no weaker than a mid-Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch?!” Chen Yirong revealed a face full of shock.

As he had only seen Huang Xiaolong defeating Sun Shihai, a late-First Order Heavenly Monarch, he had thought that Huang Xiaolong’s strength would at most be comparable to a mid-level Heavenly Monarch.

It was no wonder that he was shocked when Fang Mingyu declared that Huang Xiaolong was as strong as a Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch.

Fang Mingyu nodded his head, “When he saved me from prison in Nightless City, he severely injured a peak mid-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch grand elder from the Piercing Moon Sect with a single strike.”

Since Chen Yirong had already sworn loyalty to the Fortune Emperor Palace, Fang Mingyu found no reason to hide this from him.

“He severely injured a mid-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch in one move?!” Chen Yirong sucked in a breath of cold air.

No wonder Fang Mingyu dares to claim that Huang Xiaolong will be able to enter the top ten...

With his strength, it was nothing more than child’s play to enter the top ten ranks of the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

“Let’s just wait here for the good news. Once the Battle of the Heavenly Court ends, Huang Xiaolong’s name will surely spread to all corners of the world!” Fang Mingyu said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if Huang Xiaolong weren’t able to achieve first place, his fame would be no less than the Heavenly Prince and the young master from the Fiend God Emperor Palace. After all, he would be a mega black horse who charged his way into the top ten!

Huang Xiaolong’s talent was more than enough to shock everyone to reach this stage with barely a thousand years of cultivation.

“However, I am still curious about how Huang Xiaolong managed to get the four seniors to be his subordinates...” Chen Yirong glanced at Fang Mingyu and asked with caution.

The four seniors he was referring to were naturally the four odd beasts.

Fang Mingyu shook his head and kept quiet. He was equally curious and puzzled about this, and he had a feeling that Huang Xiaolong was hiding a shocking secret.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s secrets weren’t something he could investigate.

At this time, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship was already hundreds of thousands of miles away from the Fortune Emperor Palace.

While he was in the Divine World, Huang Xiaolong had started gathering the necessary ingredients to upgrade the low-grade Dragon Shark Flying Ship to a mid-grade grandmist spiritual artifact. When he had gone to Hell, he had managed to gather all the ingredients and had finally upgraded the Dragon Shark Flying Ship to a mid-grade grandmist spiritual artifact.

The Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s speed had increased by many times.

They traveled thousands of miles in a flash, and with their current speed, they would arrive at the Heavenly Court in less than a month.

However, as there were more than five more months to the Battle of the Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong decided to travel at a considerably more leisurely pace.

This time, in addition to the participating disciples of the Fortune Emperor Palace, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao, his masters, Golden Brow and Blood Knife were also accompanying him to the Heavenly Court.

As the Battle of the Heavenly Court was a grand occasion in the Divine World, Blood Knife and Golden Brow wanted to head over and join in the fun.

The two of them had only seen it once when their respective masters had brought them over in the past.

Inside the Dragon Sharp Flying Ship’s hidden room, Huang Xiaolong retrieved his summoning signal and contacted his Senior Brother Jiang Hong and the little cow.

Jiang Hong replied almost instantly while the little cow ignored him.

When Jiang Hong had learned that Huang Xiaolong had returned, he was extremely excited. He spoke about how the little cow was still restoring her soul at the grandmist pool and was close to fully restoring her original strength. Moreover, he had also mentioned that Li Lu and Yao Chi were still refining the grandmist spiritual fruit.

In the message, Jiang Hong also asked Huang Xiaolong about the situation in Hell and the progress in his cultivation. He also stated that they would be heading over to spectate the semi-finals of the Battle of the Heavenly Court with his master and the little cow.

Huang Xiaolong felt a warmth gush through his heart. His master, the King of Grandmist, who had gone into seclusion for billions of years, was actually willing to come out for the sake of a disciple like him! Of course, there might also be other reasons for coming out of seclusion...

Huang Xiaolong described the situation in Hell briefly and said that he had already broken through to the Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. Of course, when he mentioned Hell, he hid everything about the Netherworld King’s Organization.

They then continued their journey unimpeded.

During the night, Huang Xiaolong would refine a Brilliant Divine Sun Pill and cultivate inside his room. He would either study arrays or accompany Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and the others during the day.

Two months passed.

The Dragon Shark Flying Ship stopped. Huang Xiaolong and the rest of the people from Fortune Emperor Palace walked out of the ship. Looking at the familiar street before him, Huang Xiaolong suddenly thought of Bei Xiaomei from the Silver Fox Commerce. When he recalled her sweet and cute smile, his lips couldn’t help but curl upwards.

Has she been well for the past couple of years?

Huang Xiaolong kept his Dragon Shark Flying Ship and entered the busy street.

“Uncle!”

Before they could react, they saw a sweet lady walking towards Huang Xiaolong enthusiastically.

Who else could it be other than Bei Xiaomei?
