“Who in the world are you?!” Li Tong yelled in a hoarse voice. Even though he repeated his question, his tone was completely different. He had demanded an answer previously, but now there was a trace of suspicion and even fear hidden in his voice.

Huang Xiaolong looked at all of them with indifference, and his gaze met the terrified looks of the ancestors.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes landed on Wu Jingnan.

The blood drained from Wu Jingnan’s face, and he retreated a step subconsciously. “You...”

“Do it.” Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent voice sounded out.

The beast standing behind Huang Xiaolong moved, and it disappeared from its spot. When it reappeared, it was already standing in front of Li Tong.

A single punch was all it took.

Along with Li Tong’s miserable shriek, he suffered the same fate as Tian Changyue. When the beast’s body flashed, the after images lingered behind as all the ancestors were smashed into bits.

One of the ancestors managed to clear his mind and locked on to Huang Xiaolong. Despite the fear in his heart, he released all his killing intent, and the sword in his hand shot out. “Die, brat!”

Sword light covered the area and sword qi pierced towards Huang Xiaolong.

When the ancestor saw that his sword was about to cleave Huang Xiaolong into two, he wanted to rejoice, but a terrifying wave of energy appeared behind him. Before he could react, the wave of energy swallowed him.

Before the beast, killing Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a pipe dream.

Even a Tenth Order Emperor wouldn’t be able to kill Huang Xiaolong, much less them.

In an instant, all the ancestors were killed, and puddles of blood were left on the street.

Blood stained the ground red, and the stench diffused into the air.

Only Wu Jingnan was left alive.

He stood there, and he looked at the traces of blood all around him. A never-before-felt sense of fear and desolation gripped his heart, and despair filled his mind. He felt as though all the warmth in the world had disappeared, and incomparable coldness took its place.

Huang Xiaolong slowly walked towards Wu Jingnan.

As though the god of death himself was approaching, Wu Jingnan hastily retreated. His lips trembled, but no words came out.

Step by step, Huang Xiaolong approached him.

Wu Jingnan knew that he would face extreme danger in their conquest of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and the Glaze Devil Stele. However, he had never expected that he would die in Six Nether City itself!

“I want to know your identity before I die!” Wu Jingnan released a desperate cry. He wanted to know the identity of the person who was about to kill him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t rest in peace.

It was too bad... The moment the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong appeared before him and grabbed him by the neck. Radiance energy pierced through Wu Jingnan’s neck.

The moment the brightness energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s palm, Wu Jingnan’s eye widened, and he seemed to have realized everything.

He had initially thought that Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a young master from one of the superpowers in the Devil World, but he had thought wrong.

The brightness energy surged into Wu Jingnan’s body, and all the devil energy from his body was wiped clean, turning his body into ashes.

In the final moment, a terrifying devilish light emerged from Wu Jingnan’s head, and it blocked off Huang Xiaolong’s radiance energy.

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a moment. However, he quickly realized that this was a type of restriction the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor had placed with a drop of his heart’s blood. He had probably left it in Wu Jingnan’s godhead to protect his divine soul in the critical moment.

Huang Xiaolong’s beast roared and reached through space to shatter the Archdevil Ancestor’s protective restriction.

Along with Wu Jingnan’s howl, his body and soul were wiped out from the face of the earth forever.

Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and pulled everything of value towards him. Sweeping his divine sense through them, he found countless spirit stones, divine pills, and body armor.

All of them seemed to be of the fire attribute, and they were useful in resisting the cold. It seemed as though the Devil Ape Cult had made sufficient preparations before coming to the Frigid North Lands... There were even some peak-grade grandmist spiritual pills of the fire attribute...

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the peak-grade grandmist spiritual pills and passed the rest of the items to Gao Changran.

He didn’t lack in any of the other rubbish...

After Gao Changran thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely, Huang Xiaolong passed down his order, “Pass down the order to lock down the entire city. None of the disciples from the Devil Ape Cult can leave. Send out all the ancestors, grand elders, and elders of the Six Nether Gate to take care of them. Every single disciple of the Devil Ape Cult must die.”

The news of Wu Jingnan’s death couldn’t be concealed, and the fate of Li Tong and the others would start to spread soon. They had to take care of all the disciples of the Devil Ape Cult before they could react.

“I have received Your Majesty’s order!” Gao Changran didn’t dare to delay in the slightest.

Before long, the stench of blood filled Six Nether City.

...

When Wu Jingnan was killed, the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, who was billions of miles away from Frigid North City, stopped in his tracks.

When the Leader of the Devil Ape Cult, Zhao Chengyu, saw that the Archdevil Ancestor had stopped moving, he couldn’t help but stop as well.

“Lord Archdevil Ancestor, what’s going on?”

Devil qi covered the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, and a scarily deep voice resounded through the air. “Jingnan is dead.”

“What?!”

“The young master is dead?!”

All of the experts from the Devil Ape Cult sucked in a breath of cold air. Wasn’t their young master in Six Nether City? He hadn’t even arrived at the Eternal Devil Lands... How could he have fallen?

“Six Nether City!” The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s voice was cold.

“Lord Archdevil Ancestor, are you saying that the Six Nether Gate did it?” Zhao Chengyu didn’t dare to believe his ears. After all, all of them were clear on the power the Six Nether Gate held. Gao Changran was a mere early-Eighth Order Emperor. With Li Tong and the others, there was no way Gao Changran could have killed Wu Jingnan.

“Whether it’s the Six Nether Gate, we’ll find out in a little bit.” The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s frosty voice echoed through the air, “Increase our speed. We are going to Six Nether City right now!”

“Yes, Lord Archdevil Ancestor!”

All the experts of the Devil Ape Cult charged straight towards Six Nether City.

It was too bad. All they received was the news that all of their disciples had died at the hands of the Six Nether Gate.

The moment they heard the news, they felt as though they were struck by lightning, and rage started boiling in their hearts.

In their eyes, the Six Nether Gate was nothing more than a slightly larger ant. An ant was an ant. How dare they provoke an elephant?!

“Six Nether Gate... Gao Changran... What audacity! I swear to destroy the Six Nether Gate!” Zhao Chengyu’s voice boomed through the skies. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As for the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, he wore a solemn expression on his face. He looked into the horizon and seemed to fall deep into thought. “It seems like things aren’t that simple.”

“Lord Archdevil Ancestor’s intention is...” Zhao Chengyu couldn’t help but ask.

“The Six Nether Gate alone wouldn’t dare to send down the order to kill every single disciple from my Devil Ape Cult...” A light flickered in the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s eyes.
