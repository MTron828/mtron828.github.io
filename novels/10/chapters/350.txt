Chapter 351: Guarantee That You Can’t Stop Heaping Praises

As the inn owner approached Huang Xiaolong’s table, the lil server explained, “Owner, this is the Young Noble who intends to buy all the remaining Origin Wine.”

The inn owner was full of smiles speaking to Huang Xiaolong, “I heard that Young Noble wants to buy all the remaining Origin Wine. Honestly, our inn has no rule saying that guests cannot buy all of them, but considering the guests coming in later, can I offer Young Noble five hundred jugs?” The inn owner was extremely cordial.

Five hundred jugs? Huang Xiaolong nodded, “You can.” It wasn’t like he absolutely had to buy all the wine.

The inn owner’s tension left his body seeing Huang Xiaolong agreeing so readily. Then, Huang Xiaolong paid one hundred million gold coins to the inn owner. The latter left to prepare the Origin Wine for Huang Xiaolong after receiving payment, requesting Huang Xiaolong to wait momentarily.

Huang Xiaolong and the rest continued to talk and drink while paying attention to the discussions happening around them as the inn owner left to make preparation.

“We don’t even know if this rumored Ancient Dragon ruin is real, it has already been half a year yet there hasn’t been anyone who found its location.”

“It’s probably real, but whether real or fake, it has nothing to do with us, we’re just here to add some liveliness.”

“That’s right, even if we’re lucky enough to get a dragon egg, we probably won’t live long enough.”

Several people at a table nearby talked amongst themselves. At the same time, at another table, someone else spoke: “I heard that Deities Templar also sent someone here this time!”

“Who says there’s only Deities Templar, even Starcloud Continent’s Asura’s Gate Sovereign Chen Tianqi is here, as well as Ten Directions Continent’s Beastmen King, Lu Zhenye!”

Asura’s Gate Sovereign Chen Tianqi? Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed. This Chen Tianqi actually dared to proclaim himself as Asura’s Gate’s Sovereign, since people were recounting the matter as if it was fact, then it there was no doubt about it.

Whereas Zhao Shu issued a disdainful snort hearing that sentence. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Mister Zhao, you’re...?” Noticing the change in Zhao Shu’s face, Duan Ren inquired.

“It’s nothing.” Zhao Shu shook his head.

At this time, the inn owner returned. However, there was a bearded thin man following behind him. The inn owner stood in front of Huang Xiaolong with a chagrined face, “Young Noble, my apologies, that, Origin Wine, we can only sell ten jugs to you.”

“Ten jugs?” Huang Xiaolong maintained a calm expression, waiting for the inn owner to continue.

The inn owner went on, “Just now, our Rising Sun City’s Castellan Manor’s Steward Chen bought the rest of the Origin Wine, therefore, therefore...” words spoke until this point, the meaning was clearer than daylight. He pointed to the thin bearded man behind him, introducing, “This is our Castellan Manor’s Steward Chen.”

That Steward Chen nodded with a slight uppity attitude, “Our Castellan’s original intent was to buy all the remaining Origin Wine, however, in order to give face to the inn owner, we acquiesced to give ten jugs to you.”

Listening to what he said, it sounded as if the inn owner did not ‘plead’ for Huang Xiaolong, he wouldn’t be able to buy even one jug. Emperor Duanren, Zhao Shu, and everyone at the table were frowning.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong sounded apathetic.

That Steward Chen chuckled in a menacing manner, “Brat, let me tell you, this time, the reason our Castellan bought all the Origin Wine is to treat several Deities Templar’s Elders at the Castellan Manor.” An undisguised complacent expression plastered on Steward Chen’s face. In his opinion, Huang Xiaolong would be pissing in his pants at the mention of Deities Templar.

Obviously, being chosen to host Deities Templar’s Elders at the Castellan Manor was a glory, something countless sects and renowned families could only dream of.

While Steward Chen reveled in his ‘importance’, Huang Xiaolong instructed Feng Yang, who stood behind him: “Kill!”

“Yes, Owner.” Giant ghost Feng Yang acknowledged with respect.

Before Steward Chen understood what was happening, Feng Yang’s silhouette arrived in front of him in a speedy blur. Then, five fingers shaped into claws that grabbed the crown of Steward Chen’s head.

Steward Chen was merely a Xiantian Tenth Order warrior, sorely lacking against an opponent like Feng Yang. Before Feng Yang, Steward Chen could barely muster the thought to resist, he was locked in place by Feng Yang’s hand in an instant.

Feng Yang’s fingers pierced right into Steward Chen’s skull easily and started sucking. Right in front the inn owner’s terrified eyes, Steward Chen was sucked dry like a deflated ball.

A few seconds later, Feng Yang returned standing on the same spot behind Huang Xiaolong, without any ripples of emotion in his eyes.

Steward Chen’s stiff corpse crashed to the floor without support.

Other guests exclaimed noticing the incident at Huang Xiaolong’s table, causing a small ruckus in the inn. Still, Rising Sun City was located at a close distance to the Origin Forest, killings and fights took place on a daily basis, thus, the incident did not cause more than startled hustle.

Emperor Duanren and the two Duanren Institute’s old man stared in shock at Feng Yang standing still behind Huang Xiaolong. The intense ghost aura that broke out from Feng Yang’s body the instant he moved was clearly felt by the three of them.

A Saint realm ghost?!

The three people exchanged a look amongst them. Until this moment, Duan Ren still found it hard to believe, because he couldn’t comprehend how Huang Xiaolong could subjugate a ghost creature, moreover, one that had advanced into the Saint realm.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the inn owner impassively, “If I remember correctly, I am the one who bought the remaining Origin Wine first.”

The inn owner was jolted back to reality at Huang Xiaolong’s voice, his throat felt itchy and dry as he hastened to answer Huang Xiaolong, “Yes, it was Young Noble who bought them.”

“So, what about now?” The gaze in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sharpened.

Beads of sweat trickled down from the inn owner’s forehead. He blurted out, “They belong to Young Noble, all of them!”

“Go bring the five hundred jugs that I bought, now.” Huang Xiaolong reproached, no longer in the same amiable manner he showed earlier.

“Yes, yes, Young Noble, please wait a moment.” The inn owner quickly ran off, he had seen it just now, that tall giant man behind the Young Noble was most likely a Saint realm expert.

Merely a slave was a Saint realm expert?! The more he thought about it, the more frightened the inn owner became.

Watching the inn owner run away, Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Deities Templar?

After only a few breaths’ time, the inn owner returned with the five hundred jugs of Origin Wine that Huang Xiaolong had paid for.

...

On another side, on the main seat of the Rising Sun City Castellan Manor’s hall sat an alluring woman clad in a pastel green dress. She was none other than Li Lu’s Master, Li Molin.

In the seat below her sat Yao Family’s Old Ancestor, Yao Shan and next to him was Yao Fei. Other than them, there were three other old men wearing Deities Templar’s Elder robe.

All six people were seated, but Rising Sun City’s Castellan, Wang Cong, dared not sit. He was bowing and smiling eagerly as he stood in the hall.

Wang Cong faced Li Molin with a flattering smile, “ Elder Li, and all Elders, our Rising Sun City’s Origin Wine is absolutely superior, I guarantee that Elders won’t be able to stop heaping praises after tasting it.”

However, Li Molin did not show much of an interest, “Really?” She pointed at the last chair at the end of the hall, “You sit too.”

“Yes, thank you Elder Li.” Wang Cong was overjoyed, moving swiftly to the chair at the end and sat down.

But, at this time, a Castellan Manor guard ran into the hall looking flustered. Wang Cong’s brows tightened as he snapped at the guard in a low, restrained voice, “What happened? Where’s the Origin Wine I ordered you to get?” This was one of the guards who followed Steward Chen out to the Smooth Voyage Inn.

The guard dropped to his knees in apprehension, wailing bitterly, “Castellan, Steward Chen was killed, and the Origin Wine we ordered was all forcefully bought away by someone else.”

“What?!” Wang Cong jumped up from his chair, nerves stretched taut.
