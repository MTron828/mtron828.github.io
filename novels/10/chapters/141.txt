Chapter 142: Going to the Auction

“Million Treasures Auction?” Huang Xiaolong was bewildered.

This Million Treasures Auction House was an auction held by the Thousand Treasures Firm, and the Thousand Treasures Firm was one of three biggest firms of Duanren Empire. In the thousands of kingdoms who swore fealty under Duanren Empire, they had over two thousand branches, one in every Royal City and other important main locations.

And in Luo Tong Royal City, there was one such Million Treasures Auction House branch.

Although the Nine Tripod Commerce that Huang Xiaolong created was one of the biggest firms in Luo Tong Kingdom, when comparing to the giant Thousand Treasures Firm, it was nothing but a sesame seed.

Huang Min explained, “Big brother, you may not know, but I heard that in the auction this time there will be things other than treasures like high grade Earth rank cultivation techniques. They are even auctioning the spiritual treasure, Geocentric Esne!”

“What?! Geocentric Esne?!” Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded.

More than a hundred thousand feet deep into the earth, and after eons of undergoing certain conditions, the planet would give birth to a miraculous spiritual treasure. And that treasure was the Geocentric Esne! This Geocentric Esne was a natural treasure formed from gathering various spiritual auras for countless years. If taken by a person that cultivates in battle qi, it would provide unimaginable benefits.

Not only could this Geocentric Esne prolong one’s longevity, it also greatly increased one’s battle qi cultivation.

This effect of prolonging longevity was not as simple as taking some elixirs that could extend a lifespan.

“Yes ah, Geocentric Esne! I heard the Million Treasures Auction in our Luo Tong Kingdom even attracted people from the neighboring kingdoms and some of the bigger forces this time.” Huang Min explained.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flashed with determination.

Geocentric Esne! [1]

Even after breaking through to late-Tenth Order, Huang Xiaolong did not have much confidence in becoming the overall Academy champion in the upcoming annual competition. However, if he could bid on this Geocentric Esne, swallow it and practice, he was confident that he could advance to peak late-Tenth Order before the annual competition!

Seeing her Big brother’s expression, Huang Min knew he was hooked.

“Big brother, the auction will start in another two hours, shall we?” Huang Min said.

“Okay, let’s head over now!” Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement. Initially, he didn’t have any interest in this so-called auction, but this Thousand Treasures Geocentric Esne... he must get it!

Seeing Huang Xiaolong agree, her face lit up as she cheered in glee before swiftly pulling Huang Xiaolong out of Tianxuan Mansion by the hand.

Just as they were leaving Tianxuan Mansion, Huang Xiaolong and Huang Min ran into Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou.

“Young Lord wants to participate in the auction?!” Both were surprised when they heard Huang Xiaolong wanted to participate in the Million Treasures Auction.

“Young Master wants to bid for the Geocentric Esne?” Fei Hou took a guess and asked.

For this particular auction, the Million Treasures Auction made quite an effort to publicize the matter. For the past two days, both Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou had heard about the Geocentric Esne being auctioned many times.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Correct.” For Huang Xiaolong, there wasn’t a need to hide anything from these two people.

“Is there something you need from me?” Noticing the changes in their expressions, Huang Xiaolong asked. Both of them looked like they had something to report to him.

“We came to report to Young Lord that Big Sword Sect’s Yu Chen came to Luo Tong Kingdom. Other than Yu Chen, Ning Wang also came.” Marshal Haotian reported respectfully.

“Oh, Yu Chen, Ning Wang!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sharpened.

He didn’t expect them to appear in Luo Tong Royal City.

These two came to Luo Tong Kingdom at the same time, so the purpose should be the Million Treasures Auction!

“Ning Wang was lucky to escape in Big Dawn County, yet he dares to show his face here in the Royal City this time!” Huang Xiaolong snickered coldly. He turned to Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou, saying: “Let’s go, both of you come with me to the Million Treasures Auction!”

“Yes, Young Lord!” Both answered respectfully.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong’s group of four: Huang Xiaolong, Huang Min, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou−made their way to the Million Treasures Auction spot in a leisurely manner.

“Big brother, this time those two old fogies, Yu Chen and Ning Wang, came here so you mustn’t let them escape!” On the way, Huang Min shook her little fist angrily thinking of the two people, her little face flashing with hate.

These past few years, Big Sword Sect and the Martial Ning Family kept sending assassins to kill their family. One of those times, Huang Min was nearly injured, thus the little girl’s grudge ran deep towards these two.

Huang Xiaolong watched his little sister shaking her small fist mightily, and he couldn’t resist smiling, “When we reach the auction place, if you see these two old fogies, you go up and beat them down to the ground till they can’t get back up!”

Hearing this, Huang Min choked, and then pouted her little mouth and mumbled, “Big brother, you know I can’t beat those two old fogies!”

Huang Xiaolong grinned unabashedly.

Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou followed behind them and also cracked a smile.

On the way to the Million Treasures Auction, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the streets were growing more and more crowded. They could see many different people wearing all kinds of styles and colors. Judging from the direction everyone was moving, all of these people had come for the same goal: they were most likely the different forces that came to Luo Tong Kingdom for the auction.

An hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group of four arrived at the auction house.

The Luo Tong Royal City Million Treasures Auction House was located on the most prosperous street. It was already crowded on normal days, but today the streets were congested so that not even a drop of water could trickle through.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived, before him was a mass of black bobbing heads.

The crowd was stuck, making it hard to move forward.

Noticing this, Fei Hou walked to the front to open up a path for Huang Xiaolong.

Wherever Fei Hou passed, a strong airflow extended out that pushed everyone around, giving way to a path.

Moments later, they came to the entrance of Million Treasures Auction House.

The chief attendant of the Million Treasures Auction House was stunned when he spotted Marshal Haotian behind Huang Xiaolong, and beaming a wide smile, he hurriedly welcomed them courteously and led them up to a private room.

“Who is that kid? Even the Thousand Treasures Firm’s chief attendant came to welcome him personally?!”

“You don’t even know this? He is Luo Tong Kingdom’s most talented genius, Huang Xiaolong!

The one behind him is the Luo Tong Kingdom’s hero, only below the King, Marshal Haotian!”

“What? He is Huang Xiaolong?! There were rumors a year ago about him defeating Yang An of the Yuwai Kingdom!"

This raised an uproar through the crowd. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, there was an exception. A youth clad in a black embroidered robe was staring in Huang Xiaolong’s direction with hatred as he stepped into the Million Treasures Auction House. It looked as if he wanted to cut Huang Xiaolong into tiny pieces.

“Young Lord, the current you is not Huang Xiaolong’s opponent. You must endure this pain till the time is right!” At this time, an old man walked up behind the youth and reminded him in a whisper.

“Don’t worry Uncle Liu, I know-- I won’t act recklessly. The day will come when I annihilate Huang Family’s Tianxuan Mansion to avenge father!” The black robed youth swore through gritted teeth, and his voice was extremely cold.

That Million Treasures Auction House’s chief attendant personally arranged a private room for Huang Xiaolong’s group after leading them in through the passageway specially prepared for honored guests.

Before leaving to tend to other guests, the Million Treasures Auction House chief attendant told them that he instructed the auction house disciples to serve them if they needed anything.

After the chief attendant closed the door and left, Huang Xiaolong took a glance at the hall below and all of a sudden, he noticed a familiar silhouette.
