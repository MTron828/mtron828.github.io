Chapter 3696 – Nameless Devil Mirror

“Why aren’t you saying anything?!” The Ice Devil roared as the uneasiness in his heart grew stronger.

Jumping in fright, the Dazzling Sun Princess had never seen her father lose his temper!

“Father, I… I…”

The Ice Devil glared at the guards who were standing by the entrance and summoned them over. Since she wouldn’t say anything, he would ask them to recount what happened!

Unable to lie to the Ice Devil, they spoke of everything that happened when the Dazzling Sun Princess returned.

The blood drained from the Ice Devil’s face the more he heard. Fear and panic settled in his heart as he yelled at her, “You… You… You found a really amazing subordinate… What the f*ck is wrong with him?!”

With a pout on her face, she yelled in indignation. “They were the ones blocking the entrance! I only sent my men to ask them to retreat respectfully, but they went ahead and killed my subordinate!”

The Ice Devil sneered with rage and he slapped her across the cheek. “Your subordinate called them peasants! He called them slaves of the empire! You didn’t even ask them to leave quietly and you insulted them before knowing their identities! How is that respectful?!”

The Dazzling Sun Princess couldn’t believe that her father had slapped her and tears welled up in her eyes. “So what if he’s the Dragon Overlord?! So what if he’s the God of Death?! How dare you slap me?! When grandpa returns, I’ll tell him everything that happened! I’ll ask him to look for the old ancestor on my behalf!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Anger filled the Ice Devil’s heart and his face turned green with rage.

His father, Mo Kun, had always been biased towards the Dazzling Sun Princess. He would give her whatever she wanted, but he definitely didn’t expect for her to turn out like this.

“Men, take her down!” The Ice Devil growled. “Send her to the Ice Palace! No… Send her to the Devil Prison!”

The Dazzling Sun Princess turned pale. The Ice Palace might be terrifying, but her father wanted to send her to the Devil Prison!

“You cannot send me to prison! Why are you doing this?! I’ll tell grandpa about this!” The Dazzling Sun Princess screamed. “Please, don’t send me to the Devil Prison, you can’t send me there!”

“Didn’t you hear what I said?!” The Ice Devil roared when he saw that the guards weren’t moving.

Hesitating slightly, no one dared to touch the Dazzling Sun Princess.

The Ice Devil exploded with rage when he saw that the guards were kneeling on the ground as their bodies trembled like leaves in the wind.

“Didn’t you hear what I said?! All of you deserve to die!”

…

When that was going on, Mo Ren had brought Huang Xiaolong and the others into the palace. The entire palace was so intricately crafted that it awed many of them. It was as though they had stepped into the depths of the universe when they entered the main hall. Looking at the jade pillars that propped up the ceiling, they saw that a devil beast was carved into the structures.

Countless formations stood high above their heads as it emitted dense devil qi.

The hall might seem intimidating, but the air in there didn’t seem sinister at all. Instead, there was an invisible presence that contained the will of an overlord.

Huang Xiaolong stepped into the grand hall and he felt the overlord’s will coming from the carvings on the pillar.

The banquet lasted through the night.

When ity finally ended, Mo Ren tried his best to get Huang Xiaolong to stay. He arranged a separate courtyard for every single one in Huang Xiaolong’s party in the middle of the imperial palace.

When he was done, he summoned the Ice Devil.

“I heard that you sent Ruo’er to the Devil Prison. What’s going on?” Mo Ren asked.

As she was one of his darling granddaughters, he was a little annoyed that the Ice Devil would send her to the Devil Prison.

The Ice Devil quickly told him everything that happened.

“What?!” Mo Ren’s expression changed the moment he heard what transpired. “This lass… Why didn’t you tell me something so important?!”

The Ice Devil lowered his head and he muttered, “I didn’t dare to disturb you after seeing your interaction with the various lords… From what I see, they don’t seem like they wish to pursue the matter.”

Mo Ren frowned. “Lord Huang Xiaolong and the others chose to look over it because they didn’t wish to seem petty. They only did it because of Lord Ancestor’s prestige. However, since Ruo’er was the one who was wrong, we have to admit our mistakes! I will personally bring her to apologize to the lords tomorrow morning. We will kneel before them until they pardon us.”

The Ice Devil gasped in fright. “Second Uncle, are you going to apologize to them too?! This… Is this really needed? I’ll get Ruo’er to kneel before them in apology and we’ll call it at that!”

Mo Ren shook his head and sighed, “You don’t understand. Lord Ancestor has disappeared for countless years. If we fail to take care of this properly, no one will be able to stop them if their entire group goes on a rampage. Do you think anyone can stop three supreme overlords and someone possibly stronger than all three of them without the old ancestor present?!”

“We will need to draw on their strength if we wish to resist the Universe First Race. When that happens, we might even need them to protect us!”

During the banquet, Huang Xiaolong told them about the encounter with the Golden Cymbals King.

The Ice Devil turned serious and he eventually nodded his head.

The very next day, Mo Ren brought the Dazzling Sun Princess along with him to Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard and kneeled before the man.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t push things as he allowed them to get up before pardoning them. He changed the topic to ask about Mo Kun.

“I contacted my older brother and told him that all of you have come. He’s excited to return to meet the various lords and he’s rushing back as we speak. He should be back in a month.” Mo Ren bowed respectfully. He heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to make things difficult for them because of the incident with the Dazzling Sun Princess.

“Lord, if you have nothing else to do, why don’t you remain in the palace?”

Hesitating slightly, Huang Xiaolong eventually agreed. “Alright.”

Since they would have to wait for Mo Kun anyway, he didn’t mind staying in the palace.

“Oh right, are you familiar with the city?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

?!

“I heard that there’s a devil mirror in the city and I wish to take a look at it.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Staring at him in a daze, Mo Ren soon broke into laughter. “Of course! When would you like to visit the mirror?”

“How about now?” Huang Xiaolong got to his feet and they left the palace.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t call the others as he strolled down the city with Mo Ren.

The devil mirror existed in the city since a long time ago. Not even the Ferocious Devil could discover the secret within, and Huang Xiaolong wondered if he could do it.

When they arrived, there were countless people gathered around the Nameless Devil Mirror.

“Is it always so crowded?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Yeah, pretty much.” Mo Ren nodded. “In the past, my father said that anyone who can discover the secret behind the mirror will be able to obtain a reward from the empire. It will also belong to anyone who can bring it away.”

That was the reason behind the massive crowd.
