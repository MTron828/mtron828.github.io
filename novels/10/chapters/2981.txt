Chapter 2982: Your Highness, You’re Fine?!

“Even if His Highness falls to them, they wouldn’t dare to move against him!” The Red Fox Dao Venerable, Hu Qingye, growled, “They would only snatch away the Tree of Beginning from His Highness and grab the fruits. Oh, they might grab the Huang Long Armor too…”

Bi Cheng shook his head. “We can’t be certain of that. If Lord Creation was still alive, they wouldn’t dare to do anything to His Highness. However, Lord Creation hasn’t appeared in a long time…” It was true that he had disappeared for too damn long. When Bi Cheng recalled what the Black Shadow Devil had said to them outside the Black Lotus Pond, a sense of discomfort had swept through his heart.

“I wonder when Lord Creation will appear again…” Wu Kun sighed with an anxious expression.

As they sank into silence, all of them rushed over with the greatest speed they could muster.

An hour later, they finally arrived at the battleground between Huang Xiaolong and the various experts. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

By the time they came, they were greeted by a sorry sight. The once grandiose Blue Lotus Pond that had stood grand since time immemorial had holes punched through it, and there were spatial tears in the skies all around them. Different energies filled the space around the region.

“Absolute poison!”

“Absolute wood!”

“Absolute frost!”

“Absolute blaze!”

“There’s the power of time and nirvana too!”

The faces of everyone changed several times when they discovered the powers lingering in the air. They could imagine the battle that had gone down, and they knew that it was one that would shake the heavens. The remnants of the energies in the air could blow apart an entire heavenly cave with power left to spare!

Luckily, the Blue Lotus Pond was located in endless space. The power of endless space controlled the energies from blowing up, and if it didn’t, the creeds all around could probably say goodbye to their beloved land.

“What’s going on?! Where are they?! Where’s Poison Bodach and the others?” Wu Kun looked around with a suspicious look in his eyes. He couldn’t discover any traces of the experts who they knew had set their sights on Huang Xiaolong!

Bi Cheng and Hu Qingye could also feel that something was off. They scanned the entire area, but failed to find any traces of Poison Bodach and the others! They could clearly feel the leftover energy, and they knew that a grand battle had taken place. However, there was no one in the area!

When they were doubting their senses, someone yelled, “There!”

When they turned around, a veil of icy mist separated, and a figure emerged.

“Your Highness!” Bi Cheng and the others gasped in shock as they didn’t expect the person to be Huang Xiaolong.

Running towards him in great haste, Wu Kun was the first to speak.

“Your Highness, you seem alright!”

They could clearly feel that Huang Xiaolong’s breathing was even, and he didn’t look tired at all. He didn’t seem like he had taken part in the massive battle that occurred.

Could the news be fake? Didn’t the Poison Valley, Supreme Sword Palace, and the World Tree had lead over two hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables over to attack Huang Xiaolong?!

Huang Xiaolong explained with a placid expression, “I’m fine.” He saw the look of doubt on their faces, but he didn’t feel like explaining the battle. Moreover, there was no need to.

“Xiaolong!” When Feng Yue saw that Huang Xiaolong was fine, a look of joy filled her face.

A smile formed on his face when he saw Feng Yue. “Let’s head back. We’ll talk when we return.” Taking a step forward, he headed towards the borders of the Blue Lotus Pond.

Everyone stared at each other, and they didn’t know what to say.

Originally, they had made plans to rescue Huang Xiaolong from the hands of Poison Bodach and the others. They were ready to bleed, but Huang Xiaolong looked completely fine when they arrived! Not a single hair on his head was lost, and they failed to locate a single expert from another faction!

What the f….

“We should return too.” Bi Cheng finally made the call, and he followed behind Huang Xiaolong.

There were too many oddities, and even with his experience, he failed to wrap his mind around it.

Everyone followed behind him, and they left the Blue Lotus Pond.

“Your Highness, did you not run into Poison Bodach and the rest?” Wu Kun couldn’t hold back, and he asked Huang Xiaolong while they were leaving.

“What’s this? Do I need to report everything that happened to you?” Huang Xiaolong glanced at Wu Kun casually. When he looked over, the peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables felt their hearts trembling.

“This subordinate doesn’t dare!” Wu Kun fell to his knees instantly.

“Where’s my master?” Huang Xiaolong turned to Bi Cheng and asked.

“Old Master Cangqiong and Lady Fei Yanzi are currently in the main palace of the Dragon Fish Creed,” Bi Cheng replied hastily.

During the Creation Ceremony, Huang Xiaolong had shocked everyone with his display of strength. However, Wu Kun and the others didn’t feel threatened by him in the slightest. After all, they were standing at the peak of the Divine Tuo Holy World. When they met Huang Xiaolong’s gaze now, they felt as though a monstrous beast capable of devouring them in a single bite was sizing them up for its next meal. A sense of fear like no other gripped their hearts.

“Alright. You’ve done well.”

“Your Highness is too kind!” Bi Cheng and the others didn’t dare to reply carelessly.

With the look on his face softening, Huang Xiaolong allowed Wu Kun to rise. If he had to be honest with himself, he was still harboring a grudge over the fact that they had plotted against him in the past. The feeling of irritation he had for them was only alleviated when Bi Cheng and the others had saved the Cangqiong Old Man and the others.

In the past, the ten strongest creeds had waged a massive war with the experts of the Poison Valley, Supreme Sword Palace, and the World Tree in order to save the Cangqiong Old Man and Fei Yanzi. They had paid a huge price and lost a ton of experts in the process.

That was the sole reason Huang Xiaolong had changed his views on them.

When they finally emerged, Huang Xiaolong took a trip down to the Dragon Fish Headquarters. As soon as he picked the two, he headed straight for the Boundary Emperor Creed.

When he returned with no injuries whatsoever, the Divine Tuo Holy World bubbled with rumors. No one understood why Huang Xiaolong had managed to emerge while the experts led by the superpowers had disappeared without a trace.

There were more than six hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables who entered the Blue Lotus Pond, and rumors had it that there was a massive battle that took place. Nothing else was heard after that, and no one emerged from the Blue Lotus Pool, save Huang Xiaolong.

“Don’t tell me it has something to do with Huang Xiaolong…”

Initially, Bi Cheng and the others had said that there were tons of experts planning to ambush Huang Xiaolong in the Blue Lotus Pond! As such, everyone had deduced that Huang Xiaolong would be an extremely important piece of the puzzle if they wanted to uncover the truth.

Of course, many people turned their noses at the very thought. “Bullsh*t! Don’t tell me Huang Xiaolong managed to defeat all of them by himself! Are you hearing yourself?! Even the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Lord wouldn’t be able to do it! The only way is for Huang Xiaolong to possess the same level of strength as the true pavilion master of the Mystical Pavilion!”

As guesses flew around the everywhere, Huang Xiaolong remained in the secret chamber of the Boundary Emperor Creed in seclusion. He activated his Huang Long Bloodline, and he started to mess with the imprint in the souls of Ming Fu and the rest.
