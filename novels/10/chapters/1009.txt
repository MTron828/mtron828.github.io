When Huang Xiaolong reached the Soaring Sky Hall, the sky had barely begun to brighten. At this early hour, there weren’t many disciples heading into the hall.

Just as he was about to enter the hall, the two inner disciples guarding at the entrance blocked Huang Xiaolong’s path.

“Stop where you are! Don’t you know this is the Soaring Sky Hall? Is this a place an outer sect disciple like you can enter?” The inner disciple named Wang Hong snapped at Huang Xiaolong, loftily bearing down on Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong observed Wang Hong once over, answering, “I know. I also know this is the place where outer disciples go to for their promotion to an inner disciple.”

Wang Hong was slightly taken aback by Huang Xiaolong’s reply. He made a show of sizing up him before chuckling, “So this Junior Brother is here to get promoted to inner disciple, but Junior Brother still isn’t an inner disciple yet. Outer disciples who want to enter the Soaring Sky Hall have to pay a thousand shenbi.”

Of course, that was a blatant lie. However, outer disciples like Huang Xiaolong who had just advanced to the Heavenly God Realm could only swallow their anger to avoid offending these older inner disciples despite knowing very well that the Soaring Sky Hall didn’t have such rules. Hence, most outer disciples would choose to pay.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Is that so? And if I don’t pay?”

This inner disciple actually dared to collect ‘fees’ here, but he had chosen the wrong target today.

Wang Hong’s expression sank at Huang Xiaolong’s response, “You don’t want to pay? That’s also possible. I’ll let you enter the Soaring Sky Hall if you can still stand after receiving a punch from me!” He had also come across disciples like Huang Xiaolong before who refused to pay, this kind of bone-headed people, he would just let them suffer a bit and they would be wailing to cough up the money all too willingly.

Without waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s reply, Wang Hong already attacked.

His fist force rushed out like waves of fire, whelming and powerful. Wang Hong used the Barbarian God Sect’s Waves of Fire Fist.

Wang Hong’s cultivation was at early Second Order Heavenly God Realm. Anyone who had just advanced to First Order Heavenly God Realm would be bedridden for a good few months if they were struck by this attack.

While Wang Hong thought he would send this outer disciple flying, Huang Xiaolong’s hand reached out, holding Wang Hong’s fist in the air. Then, with a twist, a blood-curdling scream was heard. Wang Hong’s whole right arm was twisted out of shape.

Huang Xiaolong lightly shook his arm and Wang Hong was thrown into the air, slamming into one of the stone pillars in the hall.

“My arm, my arm!!” Wang Hong screamed in pain, shocked even as he glared hatefully at Huang Xiaolong, his eyes turning red with bloodlust. “You bastard, who are you?! You dare injure me, I’m a member of the Sky Dragon League, you’re dead, I tell you! Dead!”

The Sky Dragon league again! Huang Xiaolong scowled at the name.

Although it hadn’t been long since he entered the Barbarian God Sect, he had heard the name ‘Sky Dragon League’ being mentioned frequently by both the inner and outer disciples.

This Sky Dragon League had been established by the Barbarian God Sect’s current chief disciple, Chen Hao. The league had three to four thousand inner disciple members, and even some core disciples were invited.

Right after breaking through to the Heavenly God Realm, Zhu Wanchen too was invited to join this Sky Dragon League.

“Oh, a member of the Sky Dragon League.” Huang Xiaolong snickered, then walked into the Soaring Sky Hall without another glance at Wang Hong.

It was at this time that footsteps thundered toward the entrance when Huang Xiaolong was about to walk in. Clearly, the battle had alerted some disciples’ attention.

The first group to arrive were several disciples clad in the law enforcement hall robes.

When Wang Hong saw these disciples, his eyes lit up, shouting loudly, “Cao Yang, it’s great you guys are here. This brat is trying to trespass into the Soaring Sky Hall and gravely injured me, don’t let him escape!”

The several law enforcement hall disciples were stunned, then turned to look in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

When they saw who Wang Hong was talking about, all of their expressions tightened, blurting out in unison: “Huang Xiaolong!”

These several law enforcement hall disciples were the very same ones who had been rushing to capture Huang Xiaolong during the Submerging Dragon Ranking battle under Elder Jiang Yan’s command, but were sent flying off the stage with a single punch.

Huang Xiaolong had left a deep impression on them, thus all of them recognized him at a glance.

Hearing the several law enforcement hall disciples’ shout, Wang Hong paled with dread. His head snapped up, looking at Huang Xiaolong. ‘This black-haired young man is that Huang Xiaolong?!’

The result of the Submerging Dragon Ranking battle had spread throughout the entire sect, so that everyone knew Huang Xiaolong’s name.

A genius disciple with a low grade king rank godhead who defeated five Heavenly God Realm law enforcement hall disciples with one punch, even refusing to become the Ancestor’s personal disciple in public!

Either one of this matters was sufficiently shocking to anyone.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the several law enforcement hall disciples, looking instead at Wang Hong with a derisive sneer on his face, “Do I still need to pay one thousand shenbi to enter the Soaring Sky Hall?”

Hearing this, how could the several law enforcement hall disciples not understand what happened.

Relying on the fact that he was part of the Sky Dragon League and that his Master was an Elder, this Wang Hong had bullying outer disciples who had just broke through to Heavenly God Realm for many years, forcing them to pay one thousand shenbi to enter the Soaring Sky Hall.

Wang Hong’s face turned ugly, but he forced himself to smile at Huang Xiaolong, shaking his head, “So, it’s Senior Brother Huang, had I known it was you, I still wouldn’t dare to collect money from Senior Brother Huang given a hundred times more courage.” These words were the truth.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over Wang Hong one last time before entering the Soaring Sky Hall.

Upon arriving at the inner hall where outer disciples got promoted to inner disciple, he revealed his Heavenly God Realm cultivation and easily passed the assessment. After collecting his inner disciple robe and jade token, Huang Xiaolong left the inner hall.

When he came out, Wang Hong and the group of law enforcement disciples were no longer at the entrance.

From the Soaring Sky Peak, Huang Xiaolong headed to the Stone Lion Peak that wasn’t far away. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Stone Lion Peak, Nine Crow Peak, Beckoning Distance Peak, and a dozen other mountains had at least fifty thousand independent cultivation mansions specifically built for the Barbarian God Sect inner disciples.

After Huang Xiaolong passed the inner disciple assessment, the Elder in charge arranged a cultivation mansion for him on the Stone Lion Peak.

Two hours later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Stone Lion Peak and easily found his cultivation mansion.

He took out his new inner disciple identity token to deactivate the restriction array and entered. He was then welcomed by a burst of rich spiritual energy.

After a short tour around the new cultivation mansion, Huang Xiaolong was extremely satisfied. Other than a dedicated cultivation room, there was a pill refining chamber, a study, and even several hundred square meters of garden area where he could plant some herbs.

There was a spiritual energy gathering array at the center of the Sanctity of Order Mansion, moreover, this array used at least grade three divine stones, maybe even grade four.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t in a hurry to cultivate as his feet brought him to the study.

This room was small but spacious. Inside it was a bookshelf made from divine wood holding about two to three hundred books.

Huang Xiaolong randomly picked one and flipped through the pages. It was a rank two divine battle art, a technique called Lightning Flick. Huang Xiaolong put the book back and picked another one, but seeing it was another low-level battle art, he couldn’t help feeling disappointed. Looks like he needed to make a trip to the library if he wanted to learn any high-level techniques.
