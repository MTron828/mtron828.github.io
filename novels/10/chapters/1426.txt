Huang Xiaolong walked out of his room and tilted his head up. He raised his arms and stretched lazily, enjoying the radiant sunshine. Muffled popping and cracking noises came from his body.

During this one year’s cultivation, not only had he smoothly absorbed all three remaining Sea Gods’ spirits’ energies, but also refined one piece of early-Seventh Order God King Realm’s Buddha Paste.

Now, there was a pure and robust Buddhism energy circulating through his meridians, and internal organs; he could even feel a comfortable warm energy flowing through the pores of his body.

The Buddhism energy was the most yang, gentle, and warm energy in the universe, therefore, the Buddha Paste refining process had gone smoothly, unlike when he had needed Xiang Xun’s assistance when refining Sea God’s spirit.

The Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead was emitting a brilliant golden Buddha luminance within Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness.

Huang Xiaolong had successfully broke through to Sixth Order Ancestor God Realm during this period of cultivation!

That’s right, Sixth Order Ancestor God Realm!

Now, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could explode and a Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm master with one punch.

After checking his body’s internal situation, Huang Xiaolong took long strides to the front-yard of the residence.

“Master!”

“Manor Lord!”

Upon seeing Huang Xiaolong, others quickly saluted respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at them; his gaze then shifted onto the flying ship in the middle of the yard. This flying ship was the integration of the Giant Shark Flying Ship and Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship, and the outer appearance of the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship had changed slightly. Now, the flying ship’s dragon body had two sharp sword wings on the sides, the flying ship’s dragon head had an enormous piercing shark’s fin, and the whole ship’s body had turned a deep blue.

Rows of deep blue dragon scales were forming a protective layer over the whole flying ship’s body, reflecting halos of light that the onlookers couldn’t help but admire.

However, the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship’s dragon claws were still there. The oppressive dragon might was gone, but it had not diminished the flying ship’s beauty, instead there was an added sense of simplicity and swiftness.

“Xiaolong, what do you think?” The little cow asked as she came to Huang Xiaolong’s side with her tail swinging, clearly asking for praise.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and praised, “Not bad.”

The little cow’s face split into a grin, and she agreed, "Of course, in order to integrate the two flying ships perfectly, this cow has exerted the effort of nine cows and ten tigers. Though the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship’s speed has not increased by much, it’s defenses and attacks have increased significantly!"

Speed did not increase by much?

Huang Xiaolong frowned but relaxed again, after all, the little cow had already told him this point earlier. Moreover, from the little cow’s tone, there was more than a ‘significant’ increase in the flying ship’s defenses and attacks.

“Come on, let’s take a look inside.” Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Xiang Xun, and others all boarded the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship.

There were some changes inside the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship, when compared to the time he had bought it at the auction. Previously, the drawings on the walls were solely related to the Dragon Clan, whereas now, there was a mixture of sea tribe’s totems.

The spiritual energy gathering formation inside each cultivation room had also been altered slightly. Upon testing, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the surroundings’ spiritual energy was gathering much faster than before.

Huang Xiaolong then headed to the main control hall of the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship to test the enhanced defenses and attack power.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head with satisfaction and said to the little cow, Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, and others, “You all have worked hard.”

Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, and others waved their hands in a fluster, claiming they would not dare to take any credit, and gave all the credit to the little cow.

The little cow snickered, "Though the flying ship is reforged using my secret technique, all the hard work is done by you all, so no need to be humble. Xiaolong is a generous kid, so you can voice your requests to Xiaolong; you all don’t need to be polite.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled and pointed a finger in the air. A split second later, spirit stones tumbled down like a waterfall. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, and the others were dumbfounded as these falling spirit stones were all high grade-eight spirit stones!

Huang Xiaolong was now able to condense high grade-eight spirits stones after breaking through to the Sixth Order Ancestor God Realm. This meant that he would be able to condense grade-nine spirit stones after breaking through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm!

“These high grade-eight spirit stones are for all of you.” Huang Xiaolong said to Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi, “Come look for me when you run out of them.”

Xu Baisheng and his three grandnephews gulped audibly.

The little cow gave Xu Baisheng a kick and scolded, “Have you turned silly? Didn’t I already say Xiaolong is a generous kid. If you guys don’t want it, then give them all to me.”

Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, and the rest came to their senses, and swiftly thanked Huang Xiaolong.

After they had started following Huang Xiaolong, Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi had completely surrendered to him, and like Xu Baisheng, the three of them had started calling Huang Xiaolong -Master.

Huang Xiaolong had them stand up and said to everyone, “Everyone get ready, we’re leaving this Esteemed Buddha City tomorrow. As for today, let’s go out for a walk, and buy whatever you guys want to buy.”

Advancing to the Sixth Order Ancestor God Realm and the successful integration of the Giant Shark Flying Ship and Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship left Huang Xiaolong in a good mood.

The others cheered happily as they were going to go out.

“It’s not suitable to call this the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship anymore, since it’s being merged with the Giant Shark Flying ship, I think let’s call it the Dragon Shark Flying Ship.” Huang Xiaolong stated his opinion as everyone stopped cheering. With that decided he began refining the Dragon Shark Flying Ship with a wave of his hand.

As there were no restrictions on the Dragon Shark Flying Ship, he was able to completely refine it in a short one hour, and became its master. Now, he was able to control every part of the flying ship.

Sparks of lightning sizzled softly on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead as the Dragon Shark Flying Ship shrunk in size and flew into the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space. Then, with a wave of his hand, he led the little cow, Xiang Xun, Feng Er, and the rest out of the residence, once again patronizing the shops in the center area of the Esteemed Buddha City.

Before their next day’s departure, Huang Xiaolong was planning to use all of his condensed spirit stones to purchase top-grade chaos spiritual pills, and herbal materials to refine those top-grade chaos spiritual pills.

A day full of harvest later, Huang Xiaolong’s group boarded the Dragon Shark Flying Ship and sped away from the Esteemed Buddha City, journeying back to Vientiane World.

Huang Xiaolong did make a trip to the Silver Fox Commerce branch before leaving, as this Silver Fox Commerce branch was located in the Esteemed Buddha City. Huang Xiaolong directly displayed the silver token given by Bei Xiaomei, and requested the Silver Fox Commerce to help inquire about Xu Baisheng’s father, Xu Xuanying’s whereabouts, as well as Xu Baisheng’s big brother Xu Baiqiang and second brother Xu Baifeng.

With the Silver Fox Commerce’s resources, it was ten thousand times better for them to inquire about the matter than Huang Xiaolong.

On another side, Wang Tong heaved a sigh of relief, when a subordinated reported to him that Huang Xiaolong had left the Esteemed Buddha City. And two weeks later, he was completely relaxed when Huang Xiaolong had safely left the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.

With Huang Xiaolong’s high grade-eight spirit stones fueling the Dragon Shark Flying Ship, it tore through space in the direction of Vientiane World at startling speed.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars were sitting inside the Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s cultivation room number one. Huang Xiaolong’s body was enshrouded in a golden luminance and a small, approximately a meter tall golden Buddha was hovering in front of him. This was a Buddha Paste refined with secret ancient technique.

Waves of Buddhism energy were surging out from the Buddha Paste into Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars’ bodies.
