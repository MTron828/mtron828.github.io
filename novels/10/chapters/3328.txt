Chapter 3329: Kowtow Three Times Every Time You Take A Step

When Huang Xiaolong headed over to the Purple Flame Sect, the various large families around the world did the same. 

The old ancestor of the Ice Palace, Zeng Ruishen, did the same. Even the old ancestor and patriarch of the Divine Court Sect made a trip over. 

The valley master of the Ghost Valley did the same, even though both factions didn’t turn up for the battle in the Japanese Alliance.

Even though the six strongest factions were hailed as such, the Divine Court Sect was the strongest among all of them!

Their strength had always been a mystery.

The Ghost Valley was the most mysterious faction out of the six, and their secret art terrified almost everyone in the world. 

When the members of the Ghost Valley used the secret art of their Ghost Race, they would turn into monstrous beings!

Huang Xiaolong looked at the mountain ranges and forests that he passed without the slightest trace of panic on his face.

Huang Shengan called Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden.

“Your Highness, Ren Qi passed down an order a moment ago! He said that you would have to climb up the steps of the mountain and kowtow thrice every time you take a step!” Huang Shengan lowered his head and muttered.

“Oh. How many steps are there to reach the gate of the Purple Flame Sect?” 

“There are around two thousand of them,” Huang Shengan stammered.

“So… Ren Qi wants me to kowtow six thousand times?” A weird light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“Yes… Yes…” Even though Huang Shengan was on a video call with Huang Xiaolong, he could feel the killing intent from across the screen.

“Ren Qi also said…” 

“What else did he say?” Huang Xiaolong snapped, “I hate people who beat about the bush!”

“He also said that Your Highness has to endure an hour of torture with the purple flames before he will allow you to live!” Huang Shengan muttered.

The terror of the purple flames could cause the hearts of everyone on Earth to quake in fear.

Even a tiny bit of the purple flames could turn a giant mountain into ashes. Ren Qi wanted Huang Xiaolong to endure it for a whole hour!

“Oh. Is that it? He wants to burn me for an entire hour?” Huang Xiaolong nearly laughed out loud when he heard what Ren Qi wanted to do. 

Huang Shengan lowered his head in embarrassment. 

“What did the other families and factions do after they heard that I’m heading over to the Purple Flame Sect?” 

“When they heard that Your Highness was heading over, everyone did the same thing. The old ancestors and patriarchs of their factions chose to head over to watch the show. Even the Divine Court Sect and Ghost Valley headed over. Other than our Huang Family, basically every family in the world is heading there right now.” 

“Ying Tian and He Yuankang used the fastest flying ship they could find and they are heading there right now!”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Huang Shengan reported everything truthfully to Huang Xiaolong.

“Seems like everyone thinks that I’m there to apologize,” Huang Xiaolong snickered.

“Yes…”

“Pass down my order. Every disciple of the Huang Family is to put down everything they are doing right now to head over to the Purple Flame Sect.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong in shock through the screen, Huang Shengan hastily agreed.

After he terminated the connection, Huang Xiaolong closed his eyes for a second. When he opened them again, a terrifying ray of light emerged and the world seemed to turn a little brighter.

With his arms clasped behind his back, a serene look returned to Huang Xiaolong’s face as he stared into the distance.

He didn’t bother speeding up as he allowed the flying ship to continue traveling slowly. Since everyone wanted to be there to watch the show, he shall allow them to do so!

With his current speed, he should be able to arrive in half a day.

There was no way anyone would be slower than him.

Four hours later… 

Countless experts stood around the peak of the Purple Flame Sect as they waited for the show to start. The number of experts in the Nascent Soul Realm or higher couldn’t be counted!

As the number one expert in the Huaxia Alliance, Ying Tian was like a normal spectator there. In front of the various super sects, he was merely an ordinary cultivator.

“Old ancestor, is Huang Xiaolong not here yet? Practically all the experts on Earth have arrived,” Ying Zhi asked.

Shaking his head, Ying Tian sighed, “Huang Xiaolong seems to be controlling the speed of his flying ship.”

“Hehe. Controlling the speed? He’s definitely slowing down on purpose!” He Ding, the patriarch of the He Family sneered.

“Does he really think that he can hide from this by driving slowly?” The old ancestor of the He Family snorted. “What a pity.”

He was sorry for Huang Xiaolong. According to him, Huang Xiaolong would have no difficulty breaking through to the Spirit Severing Realm. It was too bad he would be killed after spending such a short time on Earth!

Ying Tian shook his head and remained silent. It was clear he thought the same.

After a hundred years of absence, everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong’s talent was insane. However, it was too bad he had to offend the various super factions.

“The experts of the Divine Court Sect and Ghost Valley have arrived!” 

Two groups of people soared through the skies, and one of the groups was clad in golden robes. The others were clad in black robes that caused one’s heart to tremble when one looked at them.

Divine Court Sect!

Ghost Valley!

Everyone broke out into a flurry of activities all of a sudden.

“Is that the old ancestor of the Divine Court Sect?” He Yuankang’s pupils shrank as they landed on the silver-haired elder leading the two groups. There was a golden symbol on his forehead, and he looked extremely well-built. There was an air of majesty around him.

That was the first time He Yuanang saw the old ancestor of the Divine Court Sect.

“Yes.” Ying Tian replied and a look of fear could be seen in his eyes.

That wasn’t the first time he was meeting the old ancestor of the Divine Court Sect, Cao Gang.

The protective formation around the Purple Flame Sect opened when the two groups arrived, and a group of experts emerged.

When the members of the Ice Palace and the other factions arrived, no one came out to welcome them. Now, the experts of the Purple Flame Sect were personally welcoming the members of the Divine Court Sect and Ghost Valley. One could only imagine how strong they were.

When Cao Gang saw the person who came out, he roared with laughter, “Brother Ren Qi, it’s been so long!”

Ren Qi!

Everyone stared at the young man who emerged from the Purple Flame Sect in shock.

He was the ancestor Ren Qi who came from the headquarters of the Purple Flame Sect! He was the Ninth Level Spirit Severing Realm expert they were talking about!
