Huang Xiaolong decided to exchange one thousand top saint grade spirit stones because he didn’t want to stand out, but he still attracted the attention of the masters present in the hall...

“I’ll take these one thousand top saint grade spirit stones!” While the shop employee was still stupefied looking at the pile of top saint grade spirit stones, a voice broke the silence.

Huang Xiaolong and everyone in the hall turned to look at the voice’s owner and a young man clad in a black robes walked out from the crowd.

What attracted Huang Xiaolong’s attention was the fire phoenix emblem on the chest of that young man’s black robe.

Someone from the Vermilion Bird Institute!

Moreover, only elite disciples of the institute wore black-colored robes.

No one present noticed the glimmer in the depth of Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he saw the black-robed young man.

The Vermilion Bird Institute’s elite disciple, Cheng Huai’an, walked up without a glance at the shop employee, speaking directly to Huang Xiaolong, “These thousand top saint grade spirit stones, I want them. I’ll give you three hundred thousand for each, total three hundred million.” His tone condescending, not negotiating, but ordering, as if giving Huang Xiaolong three hundred thousand for each top saint grade spirit stone was doing Huang Xiaolong a great favor.

Finished speaking, Cheng Huai’an didn’t wait for Huang Xiaolong’s answer, his hand reached out to collect the one thousand spirit stones. As for the three hundred million that he spoke of, they were nowhere to be seen.

Apparently, this guy was trying to get a windfall with an empty hand...

However, before Cheng Huai’an’s hand touched the pile of one thousand top saint grade spirit stones, a light flashed and every stone returned to Huang Xiaolong’s Asura Ring.

Cheng Huai’an was stunned.

“Excuse me,” Huang Xiaolong said, his expression aloof, My one thousand top saint grade spirit stones will only be exchanged with this shop.”

Surprisingly, Cheng Huai’an wasn’t angered by Huang Xiaolong’s words, laughing instead, “I say, kiddo, it seems you don’t know who I am. Things that I, Cheng Huai’an, want, which shop in the Vermilion Bird City dares to compete with me? You insist to exchange in this shop, but does this shop dare to exchange with you?” He turned to the shop staff, ordering: “Go call your Supervisor!”

Very soon, a supervisor-looking middle-aged man came running out until he was in front of Cheng Huai’an, flustered and frightened as he guaranteed that the shop wouldn’t accept any exchange transactions with Huang Xiaolong.

Watching the supervisor’s terrified expression, Cheng Huai’an nodded with satisfaction, then turned to mock Huang Xiaolong, “See? So, do you still want to exchange with this shop? Hehe, would you like to try other shops in Vermilion Bird City?”

Huang Xiaolong remained unperturbed, “If no shops in Vermilion Bird City are willing to exchange, I’ll go to other cities.”

Cheng Huai’an?

Although Huang Xiaolong didn’t know this Cheng Huai’an’s background, he could vaguely guess.

The Cheng Family was one of five of Vermilion Bird’s hegemony forces, rivaling the Vermilion Bird Institute.

Furthermore, Cheng Huai’an wasn’t just an ordinary elite disciple of the institute, otherwise he wouldn’t behave in such imperious manner in Vermilion Bird City.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong say that he’d go exchange in other cities, Cheng Huai’an eyes narrowed dangerously, this was the first time someone dared to defy him.

“Kiddo, think of the consequences of your actions.” Cheng Huai’an sneered, “Trading with me can still get you 300 million. If you exit Vermilion Bird City, forget 300 million, you wouldn’t even get one Zhuque coin! Who knows, you might even lose your little life!” Cheng Huai’an stared piercingly at Huang Xiaolong, his eyes thick with murderous light.

Huang Xiaolong ignored Cheng Huai’an words and walked out of the shop. He subsequently tried several other shops in Vermilion Bird City, but when he failed to exchange in these shops, he put on an exasperated face, unwillingly heading toward the city’s exit to go another city.

When Cheng Huai’an received the report from his subordinate, a cold sneer spread over his face, “Kiddo, you chose this, so don’t blame me.” He headed toward the city gates as he said this, chasing behind Huang Xiaolong.

Though confident of his background, Cheng Huai’an dared not really kill inside Vermilion Bird City. However, outside of Vermilion Bird City was a different story.

It didn’t take long for Cheng Huai’an to catch up to Huang Xiaolong, grinning coldly as he watched Huang Xiaolong’s figure slightly up ahead.

Noticing that Huang Xiaolong was truly heading to the nearby city, Cheng Huai’an smirked. In a blur, he appeared right in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Cheng Huai’an stood with his arms folded across his chest, chuckling with malice, “Kiddo, didn’t I warn you? If you leave Vermilion Bird City, not only will you not get 300 million for those spirit stones, you might even lose your little life. Now, are you taking out those one thousand top saint grade spirit stones yourself, or do you want me to do it?”

Huang Xiaolong watched Cheng Huai’an, suddenly flashing a smile full of bloodlust, “Your status in Vermilion Bird Institute is very high, right?”

Cheng Huai’an was stumped for a moment, failing to understand why Huang Xiaolong would ask if he had a high status.

“Correct.” Not thinking too much about Huang Xiaolong’s question, his manner complacent, “Not only am I the grandson of the Cheng Family’s Great Grand Elder, I’m also Vermilion Bird Institute Grand Elder Wude’s personal disciple. My Master Wude is in charge of the Vermilion Bird Institute’s Punishment Hall, even the Institute Principal has to mind his manners in front of my Master.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “I’m glad.” He had decided to use this elite disciple’s identity as a disguise. Another reason was that elite disciples were less eye-catching than an Elder or a Grand Elder. Moreover, elite disciples need not take tasks and leave the institute, giving Huang Xiaolong ample time to stay inside the Vermilion Bird Institute.

The problem was, an ordinary elite disciple was not authorized to enter the inner section of the library, whereas for the information about the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire, more likely than not, would be in the inner section.

Therefore, an elite disciple with Cheng Huan’an status was ideal.

As Cheng Huai’an grew increasingly confused, Huang Xiaolong’s hands waved outwards. Almost unnoticeable golden lights glimmered in the airspace as golden silkworm threads spread out, locking the surrounding space and creating a barrier from the outside world.

This was an ancient divine artifact, the God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope. It fell into Huang Xiaolong’s hands after the Azure Dragon Institute’s Grand Elder Li Qingming died.

At this moment, Huang Xiaolong’s peak late-Ninth Order God Realm aura was fully released.

Cheng Huai’an was terrified as his pupils dilated looking at Huang Xiaolong; this man was not a late-Third Order God Realm?!

“You, who are you?! What do you want?” Forcing himself to calm down, Cheng Huai’an demanded in false bravado.

Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to entertain Cheng Huai’an’s nonsense. A powerful suction force from his hands pulled Cheng Huai’an toward him, then he scoured Cheng Huai’an soul.

A short while later, the soul-scouring ended and a palm strike exterminated Cheng Huai’an’s soul. In the next second, Huang Xiaolong’s features, height, and body shape transformed into Cheng Huai’an’s. An exact copy.

Huang Xiaolong then changed into Cheng Huai’an’s elite disciple robe before retrieving the God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope and flying in the direction of the Vermilion Bird Institute.

When he stepped into the Vermilion Bird City once more, everything was calm and peaceful. Huang Xiaolong no longer needed to exchange any Zhuque coins.

As the Cheng Family Great Grand Elder’s grandson, as well as Vermilion Bird Institute Grand Elder Wude’s personal disciple, Cheng Huai’an’s spatial ring did not lack Zhuque coins.

After taking a round the Cheng Family’s estate, Huang Xiaolong finally made his way to the Vermilion Bird City’s transmission array, paid the fees, and was transferred inside the Vermilion Bird Institute’s grounds.

‘This is the Vermilion Bird Institute?’ Stepping out from the transmission array, Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

In the large square up ahead was a giant statue of a fire phoenix.

Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air. Following the memory from Cheng Huai’an, he flew toward the mountain where his dwelling place was located. As for the Vermilion Bird Institute, he could visit it in a day or two. Even if he wanted to hurry, there were things that couldn’t be rushed. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It took him twenty years of research before he could pinpoint the Black Tortoise Divine Fire’s location.

The time he was going to spend here would not be short.
