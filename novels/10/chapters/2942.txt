Chapter 2943: Huang Shuai Wants To Deal With Him Personally

Everyone was dumbfounded that Huang Xiaolong really crushed Liu Xinxin’s neck.

Yin Yue arrived right at this moment, and nearly fainted witnessing this sight. When she was rushing over, she was still desperately trying to think of a method to protect Huang Xiaolong, but now, everything was too, too late!

Her Eldest Senior Brother Chen Tianyang and Silver Shadow Creed’s Ancestor Hou Tingwei arrived right behind her. After the initial shock receded, both of them were thrilled.

“Ha, this Huang Xiaolong thinks he’s dying too slowly, ah! This is the Dragon Fish Creed’s headquarters. Liu Xinxin is Grand Hall Master Li Xue’s personal disciple, but he actually dared to lay a hand on Liu Xinxin!” Chen Tianyang couldn’t hold in his joy.

Hou Tingwei was laughing just as hard, but the corner of his eye caught sight of Lin Zhuoyi embedded in the city wall. “Is that Lin Zhuoyi? Did Huang Xiaolong do that? Huang Xiaolong, ah Huang Xiaolong. No one can save you now!”

Chen Tianyang added, “No, there is one person who might save Huang Xiaolong, except the Mystical Pavilion Master. If the Mystical Pavilion Master comes here, Huang Xiaolong might be able to keep his life.”

Their laughter reached the sky.

The Mystical Pavilion Master had not appeared in public for many years, and no one had seen his true face. Pray ask, how could someone like that, with no connection to Huang Xiaolong whatsoever, come to save Huang Xiaolong?

Huang Xiaolong crushed Liu Xinxin’s neck, and then shot a punch at her head, shattering her skull, and digging out her dao soul.

“Huang Xiaolong, my master won’t spare you. The Dragon Fish Creed won’t spare you. His Highness Huang Shuai won’t spare you!” Liu Xinxin shrieked at the top of her lungs, “You will regret being born in this world soon enough!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong drawled as he sent out a string of nirvana flame that wrapped around Liu Xinxin’s dao soul. Heart-wrenching screams cut across the sky. Huang Xiaolong did not imprison Liu Xinxin’s dao soul inside the dragon pearl, but let it burn and scream in the air as he set his sights on Xuanyuan Potian, Yang Jia, and Lu Chengfeng.

Just one look from him sent Xuanyuan Potian, Yang Jian, and the others stepping back in dread.

Huang Xiaolong lightly pressed his palm in the air, and Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng returned to his side in the blink of an eye, whereas those disciples detaining them were all embedded into the city walls behind them. However, Primal Ancestor Realm disciples’ luck was not as good as Lin Zhuoyi as they were unrecognizable splatters of blood on the city walls.

Gasps of horror sounded from the crows as they were utterly frightened by Huang Xiaolong’s madness. Huang Xiaolong was definitely the first person to kill the creed’s disciples recklessly, right under the Dragon Fish Creed’s nose!

Of course, Huang Xiaolong would also be the last person!

Huang Xiaolong did something, not even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables dared to do!

If Huang Xiaolong survived to leave the Dragon Fish Creed after this battle, no one in the Divine Tuo Holy World wouldn’t know his name!

In the meantime, inside the Dragon Fish Creed headquarters’ main hall, Huang Shuai, Bi Cheng, and the others were still finalizing details of the Creation Ceremony. When they were discussing at which peak they were going to hold the ceremony, Zhu Hui, who had left not long ago, broke into the hall with an ugly expression on his face.

Huang Shuai frowned at his manners.

“What’s going on?” Huang Shuai questioned coldly, “Did Huang Xiaolong refuse to kneel outside the Dragon Fish city gates? Have Zhuoyi and Xinxin tell Huang Xiaolong that if he refuses, he wouldn’t have another chance of submitting to me.”

A strange expression flashed over Zhu Hui’s face.

“No, no, Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong,” Zhu Hui’s thoughts and words were in a mess. “Huang Xiaolong attacked and injured Zhuoyi and Xinxin!”

Bi Cheng, the Divination Creed Patriarch, Red Fox Patriarch, and the others who weren’t paying any attention to Zhu Hui now looked over.

Huang Shuai’s face darkened, “You mean that Huang Xiaolong actually has the guts to attack and injure others within the Dragon Fish Creed headquarters?!”

“Yes,” Zhu Hui confirmed, then added, “Zhuoyi was embedded on the city wall, and Xinxin’s neck was crushed on the spot!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What?!” Huang Shuai, Bi Cheng, Divination Creed Patriarch, Red Fox Patriarch, as well as Li Xue jumped to their feet in shock.

Zhu Hui further lowered his head to his chest, not daring to look at Bi Cheng or Li Xue, “Huang Xiaolong crushed Xinxin’s neck and split her skull in one punch! He’s burning Xinxin’s dao soul with nirvana flames, and her dao soul is still screaming outside the city gates right now!”

“Insolent!”

“D*mn!”

“Brazen!”

Huang Shuai, Bi Cheng, and Li Xue shouted in anger. Terrifying pressures surged from the three of them, causing the space around them to distort. Under this pressure, any Primal Ancestor Realm disciples near them would be crushed into pieces.

Divination Creed Patriarch Wu Kun harrumphed coldly, and his voice reverberated above the entire Dragon Fish City, “Huang Xiaolong provoked the Ten Creeds Alliance and His Highness Huang Shuai. He and his ten familial relatives should be beheaded! Eliminate everyone and everything connected to this person!”

Every corner of Dragon Fish City, including outside of the city, everyone heard the words.

Huang Shuai’s eyes narrowed dangerously, and he let out a chilling laughter. “Hear me well, all creeds’ experts. Huang Xiaolong’s dog-life belongs to me, none of you can attack!”

Huang Xiaolong had repeatedly challenged and provoked the Dragon Fish Creed, provoking him, Huang Shuai!

He intended to deal with Huang Xiaolong personally in front of these experts from various creeds, and behead Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong’s combat prowess might have been amazing, and even though there was a rumor circulating that in the Silver Shadow Creed, even the peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Hou Tingwei could do nothing to Huang Xiaolong, Huang Shuai was confident that he could kill Huang Xiaolong!

Initially, many experts outside the Dragon Fish City had planned to capture Huang Xiaolong to claim merit in front of the Dragon Fish Creed and Huang Shuai, but their plans fell through due to Huang Shuai’s order.

Then again, after hearing that Huang Shuai was going to kill Huang Xiaolong personally, everyone looked forward to it with anticipation, and they discussed fervently.

“His Highness Huang Shuai is going to make a move personally? With Huang Xiaolong’s combat power, he’s no weaker than a peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, is His Highness Huang Shuai confident that he can take down Huang Xiaolong?” Zhao Bowen, Patriarch of the Star Destruction Creed, exclaimed.

The Star Destruction Creed was a creed in the Misty Rain Heavenly Cave. Their overall strength was comparable to the Blue Lotus Creed, and Zhao Bowen himself, was a peak late-Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable expert.

“It’s impossible for His Highness Huang Shuai’s strength to be lower than Huang Xiaolong. Since His Highness has spoken, then he must have absolute confidence.” Another creed’s patriarch pointed out in a steadfast manner, “His Highness Huang Shuai is the Son of Creation, the God of Creation Huang Long Bloodline possesses supreme power, and none of us can imagine how powerful the Huang Long Bloodline actually is!”

“That’s right. I also think that His Highness Huang Shuai is certain that he can kill Huang Xiaolong that he made the decision to do it himself.” Another creed’s patriarch agreed.

Everywhere were experts discussing the same topic.

Although Huang Xiaolong possessed startling combat prowess, most of them chose to believe in Huang Shuai.

After all, Huang Shuai was the Son of Creation! He had the Huang Long Bloodline!

Liu Xinxin’s screaming dao soul that was enveloped in nirvana flames shrieked at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, do you hear that? His Highness Huang Shuai’s going to reap your dog-life with his own hands!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong was unruffled, “I’ll be waiting.”

Huang Shuai wants to have a go at me? Huang Xiaolong sneered. It looks like he wants to kill me in front of everyone to boost his supreme prestige.

Since Huang Shuai was going to appear, Huang Xiaolong slowed down his attacks, and took out several drops of blue lotus nectar and fed it into Long Jianfei, Duan Zheng, and Duan Feng’s mouths.
