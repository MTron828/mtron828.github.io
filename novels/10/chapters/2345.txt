Chapter 2346: A Second Complete Dao Saint Godhead

When the Clear Snow Palace’s female disciple Zhao Ya saw that Huang Xiaolong’s saint godhead had actually evolved into the Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead, her eyes widened in obvious astonishment. But at the same time, she was inwardly relieved. At her current strength, she was more than capable of suppressing Huang Xiaolong.

The Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead ranked two hundred and eighty-ninth, and was far from catching up to her Ice Lotus Saint Godhead.

Most of the experts were of the same mind as Yu Fujiang. Even though astonished, they were shaking their heads, thinking that Huang Xiaolong was bound to lose.

“Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, your talent is unparalleled in the world, as your saint godhead actually evolved to Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead in a short one year. Then again, based on your current battle strength, you are still no match against me. You are destined to lose.” Zhao Ya looked at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression as she spoke.

“Lose? Not necessarily!” Huang Xiaolong repeated calmly.

Upon seeing that Huang Xiaolong was still refusing to admit defeat, the cold sneer on Yu Fujiang’s face deepened.

Right at this time, the subtle golden rune between Huang Xiaolong’s brows emitted a blazing light, blinding everyone’s eyes, and it eclipsed all other lights on the battle stage.

“This, this is...?!” The Clear Snow Palace Master Xue Lingyun’s nonchalant face tensed.

“Master... this, can it be?!” Tan Juan asked as a thought flashed in her mind, and her eyes widened in shock.

The Holy Lands Alliance’s ten great holy masters, as well as the many Holy Gate’s and ancient clans’ patriarchs seemed to think of the same thing and an incredulous expression took over their faces.

“That rumor is actually true!” Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s True Saint Shen Jiewen was dumbfounded.

“Master, what rumor are you talking about?” Yu Fujiang was baffled when he noticed his master, and other experts’ expressions.

The golden rune between Huang Xiaolong’s brows had completely changed into a bright golden mark that was absolutely dazzling. Just one look at it caused one’s soul to shudder.

“What is that?!” Upon seeing a golden mark between Huang Xiaolong’s brows, it triggered a memory in Yu Fujiang’s mind and his face turned ugly.

Then, boom!

Something seemed to have stimulated the Holy World’s void and space, as deafening rumbles sounded in every direction and every living being in the Holy World could feel heaven and earth moving.

Before anyone could register what was going on, fine rays of golden light rained down from the void, penetrating through the numerous layers of Heavenly Master Holy Ground’s space, falling straight on Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The Heavenly Master Holy Grounds’ layer upon layer of restrictions laid out by the four Primal Ancestors could not block out these golden rays.

These golden rays were vibrant, pure, holy, and full of vigor.

“The Holy World’s origin energy!”

The various forces’ experts exclaimed in astonishment, upon seeing these golden rays.

The Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s True Saint Shen Jiewen was staring fixedly at the golden mark on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead, and his voice sounded strained, “As expected! It really is, the Holy Mandate Imprint!”

“This is the fourth Holy Mandate Imprint!” A thunderbolt struck Yu Fujiang’s mind, making him feel light headed. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and Lin Xiaoying’s cherry lips were agape watching the scene on stage.

The fourth Holy Mandate Imprint!

“This brat!!” The Heavenly Master grumbled with a hint of doting as he looked at the golden mark on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead. The corners of his mouth curved into a smile.

Lord Long, Elder Crow, and Tyrant Chu were all grinning from ear to ear.

The four of them had guessed that Huang Xiaolong had the Holy Mandate Imprint, or else he could not have made the twelve sacred steles. But it had remained a guess as they were unable to verify it until this moment.

Now, they finally had confirmed it!

“Some time back, there was a rumor circulating the Holy Heavens and the holy lands that Huang Xiaolong might be possessing the Holy Mandate Imprint, but no one believed it!”

The Clear Snow Palace Master Xue Lingyun shook her head, “Even I did not believe it because I didn’t believe there could be such a freaking genius in the world.”

On this day, they witnessed what was called a freaking genius!

“In time, Huang Xiaolong will definitely grow to be the strongest person in the Holy World!” Xue Lingyun stated. She had never said anything with this degree of certainty about Huang Xiaolong before.

Her words brought great waves of shock in Tan Juan’s, Ji Xinyi’s, and Lin Xiaoying’s hearts.

He was the future strongest person of the Holy World!

Before this, everyone was saying that Mo Cangli was the strongest person in the Holy World because Mo Cangli’s complete dao saint godhead bore the greatest evolutionary potential. But at this moment, every person present believed that the person at the top spot in the future would be Huang Xiaolong!

A striking, young man with golden-colored hair was standing with the ten great holy masters of the Holy Lands Alliance. he was clad in pure white brocade robe. At this moment, there was an ugly expression on the young man’s face as he fixed a deathly stare at Huang Xiaolong, and the look in his eyes reflected tumultuous shock, jealousy, and sinister gloom.

He was Mo Cangli’s personal disciple Huai Po!

A while back, people in the Holy World had started comparing Huang Xiaolong with his Master. On top of that, many of them felt that Huang Xiaolong’s talent was higher than his Master Mo Cangli’s. When Huai Po had heard this, his heart was extremely uncomfortable and displeased. He had joined the Holy Lands Alliance’s ten holy masters and made the trip all the way here to specificallysee Huang Xiaolong’s talent!

Before coming, he had believed that Huang Xiaolong was not even qualified to be spoken in the same sentence as his Master Mo Cangli.

But now?!

“Hmmph, even if this Huang Xiaolong possess the Holy Mandate Imprint, he is still no match against the Clear Snow Palace’s disciple Zhao Ya. He’s still going to lose in this sparring exchange!” A harsh voice broke the silence, and this voice belonged to Yu Fujiang. Despite his condescending tone, Yu Fujiang could not perfectly hide the apprehension and fear he felt from his face.

Huai Po agreed in an icy voice, “That’s right, as strong as this Huang Xiaolong’s talent is, he won’t be able to change the result of this match!”

Although Huang Xiaolong had spurred his Holy Mandate Imprint, receiving a boost of power from the Holy World’s origin energy, and risen his momentum to a shocking degree, he was still a little bit weaker compared to the Clear Snow Palace’s Zhao Ya.

If Zhao Ya’s battle strength was equivalent to ten points, then Huang Xiaolong’s current battle strength could only reach eight points!

However, bathed under the Holy Mandate Imprint’s Holy World’s origin energy, the thick layer of ice creeping up on Huang Xiaolong’s body stopped at his neck.

Though the ice stopped extending upwards, it did not recede.

By now, a hint of trepidation stained the confident look in Zhao Yao’s eyes as she looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, although you possess the Holy Mandate Imprint that significantly rises your battle power, the current you is still not enough to be my opponent. I think it will be better if you yield!”

Yet Huang Xiaolong looked collected as he responded, “Lose? Not necessarily!”

Not necessarily?

Everyone was speechless.

Huai Po mocked coldly, “This Huang Xiaolong, does he really think he can win? I don’t believe he has other concealed talents that can increase his battle strength!”

Yu Fujiang chimed in, “Lord Huai Po is right. I say Huang Xiaolong’s attitude is nothing more than putting up a front to keep his reputation, stubbornly refusing to admit defeat!”

Zhao Ya took a deep breath to readjust her mental state before saying calmly, “Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, since you are adamant not to yield, I can only make my move and make...!”

Before she could finish her words, suddenly, another complete dao saint godhead flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body. The moment this saint godhead appeared, numerous sutra chanting Buddhas filled the sky above the battle stage as if the Kingdom of Buddha were descending upon them. Golden luminance conquered everyone’s sight, and it even dominated Zhao Ya’s Ice Lotus Saint Godhead’s cold qi.

“What?!” Huai Po, Yu Fujiang, and other forces’ experts paled as if they had seen a ghost.
