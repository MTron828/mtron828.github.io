Chapter 2122: Wan Shi’s Defeat

Using the Great Purity Art at his maximum capacity would kill even ordinary high-level Sovereigns! Who would have thought that Huang Xiaolong would still be alive?! Not to mention the fact that he was completely fine...

He hadn’t sustained a single injury from Wan Shi’s strongest attack!

Wan Shi stared at Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous look before turning to look at the lightning bead.

The lightning bead that had saved Huang Xiaolong was precisely the one he had obtained in the Barbarian Space in the past.

With the protection from the lightning from inside the bead, the Great Purity qi had failed to harm Huang Xiaolong in the slightest.

Seeing as the lightning bead had managed to block Wan Shi’s Great Purity Secret Art, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

“You... Is that a supreme spiritual treasure or a saint artifact?!” Wan Shi stared at the lightning bead floating above Huang Xiaolong with a burning gaze.

Treasures that were a grade above top-grade grandmist artifacts were called supreme spiritual treasures. A saint artifact was one grade higher than a supreme spiritual treasure!

Huang Xiaolong had learned everything after searching through Wan Zhuoyuan’s memories. The lightning bead was a saint artifact, but if Huang Xiaolong had to state it truthfully, it would be a damaged saint artifact.

Even though the lightning bead was damaged, it was still a saint artifact! Based on this point alone, Huang Xiaolong was confident in killing Wan Shi!

A sneer escaped his lips, “Go think about whether this is a supreme spiritual treasure or saint artifact in your grave!” He activated all three saint bloodlines in his body after he spoke and poured his energy into the lightning bead using the method he had learned from Wan Zhuoyuan. A buzzing sound filled the air all of a sudden. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

A shockingly strong wave of energy emerged from the lightning bead, and Wan Shi felt a mountain pressing down on his chest.

His expression finally changed.

Previously, he hadn’t cared about the fact that Huang Xiaolong had the defensive layer of his Saint bloodline. The fact that Huang Xiaolong had already arrived at the peak of the late-Fourth Order Sovereign Realm hadn’t affected him in the slightest. He finally realized that things were going south when Huang Xiaolong revealed the lightning bead.

The energy contained in the lightning bead caused Wan Shi to feel an unprecedented sense of fear as the feeling of death slowly crept closer.

“Wan Shi, it’s your turn to take an attack from me!” Huang Xiaolong unleashed the attack from the lightning bead after he spoke. Tyrannical bolts of lightning formed from lightning qi appeared as they shot towards Wan Shi. They were so fast that Wan Shi couldn’t even process that Huang Xiaolong was ready to take his life!

The space around the bolts of lightning was like paper-thin glass as it shattered completely.

Even though retreating was the smartest idea Wan Shi could think of, lightning qi had already arrived in front of him. He didn’t have the time to think, and with his life under threat, he pushed his godhead to the limit. He had used all the energy in his body before covering himself with a piece of divine armor. The armor was different from before, and it wasn’t made from the Myriad Worlds Bamboo. Instead, it was deep blue in color.

There was an air of antiquity around it that transcended even Wan Shi’s strength.

It was a weird source of power that wasn’t origin energy, or chaos energy. It wasn’t even close to grandmist energy, and it was a type of supreme energy none of them had felt before.

As soon as the armor appeared around his body, Wan Shi summoned the Myriad Worlds Bamboo once again. He poured Great Purity qi into the stick of bamboo in his hands, and he smashed it towards the bolt of lightning that was about to strike him.

The combination of the Myriad Worlds Bamboo and the Great Purity qi was enough to shatter the heavens and destroy the earth. However, the Great Purity qi that reduced the City of All-Heavens into streams of chaos energy failed to do a thing to the lightning qi from the lightning bead. A massive explosion ensued as the Great Purity qi was blown apart.

The deep green stick of Myriad Worlds Bamboo in his hands didn’t fare any better as it dried up and turned into a piece of charcoal.

The lightning qi from the lightning bead didn’t falter in the slightest even after slamming into Wan Shi’s strongest combo.

Boom!

As he drew a beautiful arc in the sky, Wan Shi was flung hundreds of millions of miles away. A giant spatial crack traced his path, and the dark blue armor completely lost its luster as cracks started to spider web around it.

As Wan Shi was sent flying, a golden-green light covered his body. In the next instant, his figure disappeared, and Huang Xiaolong failed to find the slightest trace of him. It was as though he had just disappeared into thin air.

“Huang Xiaolong, just you wait! I’ll kill you personally the next time we meet!”

Wan Shi’s voice dripped with venom as it originated from an unknown void.

Circulating all the energy in his body, Huang Xiaolong swept his divine sense across the lands but failed to detect Wan Shi. After several breaths of time, Huang Xiaolong decided to stop searching.

His eyes turned cold. It seemed as though Wan Shi was holding a type of extremely high-grade spatial escape treasure.

After everything that went down, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t believe that Wan Shi managed to escape!

His mood sank a little.

Since the battle had already ended, Huang Xiaolong decided to review everything that had happened. He felt that the armor that had appeared to defend Wan Shi at the end was a little special. Thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong felt that the armor was a supreme spiritual treasure.

Wan Shi has a supreme spiritual treasure grade armor!

Huang Xiaolong would never have thought that Wan Shi would escape his miserable fate of death with the help of a supreme spiritual treasure.

Regardless, Huang Xiaolong had barely managed to learn the way to activate the lightning bead. If Huang Xiaolong had complete control of the lightning bead, it wouldn’t have mattered what Wan Shi could bring out. Even if he had an amazing supreme spiritual treasure, he couldn’t have defended himself against the lighting bead.

Now that Wan Shi had escaped, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t do a thing to him. Those who had survived or escaped stared at Huang Xiaolong with an added element of fear and respect.

Lord Wan Shi... Lost?

Huang Xiaolong defeated Lord Wan Shi!

No one dared to make a peep. The only reason they had decided to attend the World Leaders Conference was to submit to the City of All-Heavens. When they thought about the enmity between Huang Xiaolong and Wan Shi, their hearts tightened.

Would Huang Xiaolong take out his anger on us?!

As Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across those experts, he didn’t plan on making things difficult for them. He waved his hand and allowed them to leave. As soon as he pardoned them, every single one of them kowtowed towards him before leaving hastily.

After they left, Huang Xiaolong brought Wan Yue out from the Ancient Heavenly Court.

When Wan Yue reappeared in the space where the City of All-Heavens used to be, he stared at Huang Xiaolong with a fearful expression. Despite being thrown into the Ancient Heavenly Court, he had managed to catch the entire battle.
