Chapter 160: Heavily Surrounded by Soldiers from All Directions

Wei Xiaodong observed Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou for a moment before walking up to them with several Big Sword Sect disciples behind him.

“Who are you?” Wei Xiaodong asked as he looked directly at Huang Xiaolong.

As he asked this, his eyes signaled the two men in black, and they proceeded to secure the sack and hid it from view behind them.

Huang Xiaolong noticed the two black-clothed men’s actions, but he did not mind it. Looking at Wei Xiaodong, he said, “The person who wants your life!”

The person who wants your life!

Wei Xiaodong’s heart tightened; on the surface, however, he chuckled, “I think you’re joking, right? We’re Big Sword Sect’s disciples.”

“Look at me, do I look like I’m joking with you?” Huang Xiaolong shrugged nonchalantly, “Big Sword Sect disciples are exactly the ones I want to kill.”

While Huang Xiaolong was talking, Wei Xiaodong’s hands suddenly waved out towards him, countless cold darts whistled through the air, shooting at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou. These cold darts shone with an eerie green color underneath the moonlight. Clearly, these cold darts were coated with toxic poison.

Watching this, Huang Xiaolong sneered, and both he and Fei Hou raised a palm at the same time. With a slight push forward, a gust of violent wind deflected the cold darts, slamming them down to the ground.

Seeing this result, Wei Xiaodong paled slightly. Without a word to the several Big Sword Sect disciples, he turned around and fled.

Without missing a beat, Huang Xiaolong’s body blurred into motion and appeared right in front of Wei Xiaodong. Wei Xiaodong formed a fist and punched out, but Huang Xiaolong raised a hand and firmly grasped Wei Xiaodong’s fist in his palm, then exerted a little pressure. The crackling of bones breaking rang out and Wei Xiaodong’s scream split the quiet surrounding.

With Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, a little squeeze could crush a thousand-year-old tree, not to mention Wei Xiaodong’s fist.

Crushing the bones in Wei Xiaodong’s fist, Huang Xiaolong threw him back to the original spot he was in.

The several Big Sword Sect disciples also issued painful screams from being attacked, and in the blink of an eye all of them were ‘taken care’ of Fei Hou, including the two men in black.

The thick scent of blood filled the air, assailing the nose.

Wei Xiaodong smelled the scent of blood coming from the Big Sword Sect disciples and fear crept up his face. Ashen-faced, his backside fell to the ground, sliding across the soil, “Don’t, don’t kill me, I, I can give you anything!”

“Can give me anything?” Huang Xiaolong mocked, “What can you give me?”

Wei Xiaodong blanked.

“Beg, I beg you, please let me go, I can do whatever you want me to!” He quickly pleaded, head knocking loudly on the ground repeatedly.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice ridiculed him, “You’re wussier than your father.”

“My father?” Wei Xiaodong dazed for a second at the sudden mention of his father.

“It’s you!” Wei Xiaodong’s eyes widened in shock.

“I’m the one that killed your father, don’t you want to avenge your father?” Huang Xiaolong incited him.

Different emotions flickered across Wei Xiaodong’s face, but in the end, he squeezed out a smile saying, “This brother must be joking with me.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. Calling out the Blades of Asura, he no longer bothered to talk nonsense; both hands swung out and two icy sharp rays of blade lights slashed out. One slit across Wei Xiaodong’s throat, and the other drew blood from his eyebrows.

Wide-eyed, Wei Xiaodong tumbled to the ground with blood seeping into it.

“Sovereign, what do we do about the girl?” Fei Hou asked. A finger pointed toward the sack containing the Southern Cliffs City Castellan’s daughter.

“Bring her back first.” Huang Xiaolong said, sounding solemn.

“Yes, Sovereign!”

A while later, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou disappeared from the dilapidated courtyard, bringing Sun Qing’s daughter with them.

Soon, they returned to the inn with Fei Hou carrying Sun Qing’s daughter.

Seeing them come back with a girl, Zhao Shu and Yu Ming asked Fei Hou what took place. Fei Hou respectfully recounted the events to the two seniors.

At that moment, Sun Qing’s daughter regained consciousness, and when she saw four strange men in the room, she bolted up from the bed, frightened, “Who are you all? What do you want to do?!”

Huang Xiaolong looked over at Fei Hou, Fei Hou understood and briefly described the events of the night.

After Fei Hou finished, Sun Qing’s daughter relaxed a little, but she did not let go of her wariness towards Huang Xiaolong and the three men. It seemed she did not fully trust Fei Hou’s words.

“You can go back now.” Huang Xiaolong spoke.

Whether the other party believed them or not, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care, it was a moment of curiosity and coincidence, after all.

“I can go back?” Sun Lin repeated doubtfully, and then she cautiously walked to the door. Taking two steps, she looked over her shoulder at the four men before leaving.

She walked out from the room, then out of the inn, yet nothing happened, allowing her to release a sigh of relief as she hurried off.

Coming out onto the streets, she bolted back to the Castellan Manor.

At this time, people within the Castellan Manor had noticed Sun Lin’s disappearance and all hell broke loose.

“Lin’er, what happened?” Sun Qing saw his daughter walking in through the entrance, his stretched nerves relaxed as he asked anxiously.

Sun Lin broke out in tears as she repeated through sobs what Fei Hou said to her father.

“Big Sword Sect!” Rage exploded in Sun Qing’s eyes hearing what she said: “They think we’re so weak to be bullied!”

“Castellan, I think there’s a problem with those four people.” At this time, the manor’s steward stepped up and pointed out, “According to what the other party said, they saw two black-clothed men abduct little Miss, yet why didn’t they stop them at that time? Why did they wait until little Miss was brought to an abandoned dilapidated courtyard before rescuing her?”

Sun Qing’s brows furrowed deeply.

“What little Miss said came from the four people, we don’t know the actual truth of what actually took place.” Steward Liu Wen added: “Who knows if there were really any Big Sword Sect disciples. It is also a possibility that they were the ones that abducted little Miss and then pushed the matter onto Big Sword Sect before letting little Miss come back!”

A sharp light flickered in Sun Qing’s eyes as he looked over his shoulder to a guard behind him, “Four of you go to the north side of the city, and search to see if there are any Big Sword Sect disciples’ corpses; the rest of you, follow me to Warm Fragrance Inn!”

“If what they said is true, then it’s fine!”

“However, if those four people truly planned all this deliberately and pushed the blame onto Big Sword Sect...!” The sharp light in Sun Qing’s eyes deepened.

Not long after, the Castellan Manor guards surrounded Warm Fragrance Inn.

Nearby commoners were awakened by the ruckus.

Inside one of the rooms, Fei Hou said to Huang Xiaolong, “Sovereign was right, that Sun Qing doesn’t believe we saved his daughter.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

The fact that Sun Qing didn’t believe what happened was something very normal.

“Sovereign, should this Subordinate handle the situation?” Yu Ming took a step forward, asking. If it was any other person, they would not believe it so easily as well. Huang Xiaolong waved his hand with an unperturbed manner, “No need.”

Suddenly at this time, the room door was broken open, and the Castellan Manor’s guards rushed inside with fierce expressions on their faces, followed by Sun Qing in the full grandeur of his Castellan robes.

When Sun Qing walked into the room, his sullen face abruptly turned blank, and it stayed blank for quite a while as he stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Two years ago, Sun Qing once followed a general to the Marshal Mansion in Luo Tong Royal City to report military matters to Marshal Haotian. At that time, he was just a low-ranked soldier, and he didn’t even qualify to enter the mansion, thus he stood outside the entrance. From far away, he caught a glimpse of Huang Xiaolong. Despite that, that scene stayed clear in his memory up to this day. The respectful demeanor Marshal Haotian had for the same young man in front of him was unmistakable. After that time, he asked around and found out that young man was Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang, Young, Young Master Huang!” Sun Qing snapped back to reality with an ashen face, and his legs went soft at the knees, “It, it was Young Master Huang that saved my youngest daughter?”

He actually brought an army to encircle Huang Xiaolong? If...if Marshal Haotian got wind of this, what would be his ending? He had heard that even their Luo Tong King referred to Huang Xiaolong’s father, Huang Peng, as brothers!
