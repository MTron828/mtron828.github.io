“Silver Devil Sect!” A frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

In the past, he had already received intelligence that Chu Han was staying with the members of the Silver Devil Sect after entering the Devil World.

He hadn’t even gone over to cause trouble for them, but here they were messing with him!

“Your Majesty, I am at fault! Please mete out the appropriate punishment!” Gao Changran sighed in defeat.

Since the Fire Phoenix Divine Armor, Fire Dragon Scorched Heavenly Pills, and Icy Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ship were stolen, Huang Xiaolong’s plans to go to the Eternal Devil Lands had taken a hit.

Since they had caused a dent in Huang Xiaolong’s plan, Gao Changran knew that he wouldn’t be able to redeem himself even if he died a hundred times.

Unexpectedly for him, Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “It’s alright. This has nothing to do with you. Get up.”

Gao Changran was stunned. However, he respectfully declined in the next moment. “This subordinate doesn’t dare.”

“Since I have already pardoned you, I shall not harp on the matter anymore.” Huang Xiaolong spoke and didn’t give Gao Changran a way to refuse.

Gao Changran finally placed the guilt in his heart down and lowered his head as he got to his feet. He didn’t dare to look at Huang Xiaolong, and he behaved as though he was a kid who was caught doing something terrible.

“Tell everyone to get ready. We’ll be taking a trip to the Silver Devil Sect. We’ll head over to the Eternal Devil Lands after making a stop at the Silver Devil Sect.” Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice boomed through the hall.

“Your Majesty, we received news that the Silver Devil Sect are heading straight to the Eternal Devil Lands!” Gao Changran made another report.

The light in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered. “That’s fine. We’ll head over to the Eternal Devil Lands to wait for them.”

“Are we going there right now?” Gao Changran jumped in fright. “But... but we don’t even have the Icy Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ship!”

Huang Xiaolong waved his arm to dismiss Gao Changran. “It doesn’t matter. I have plenty of spirit ships. We’ll look for the Silver Devil Sect after arriving at the Eternal Devil Lands. What’s the worst that can happen? We’ll just buy another one if we can’t find them.”

The Netherworld King’s Flying Ship might be a peak-grade grandmist artifact, but it didn’t possess any cold resisting formations. It was better for them to get a flying ship with fire arrays inscribed on it.

As for the fire attributed spiritual pills and armor, they had plenty of them after killing Wu Jingnan and the others.

“Yes, this subordinate will make the arrangements right now!” Gao Changran bowed and acknowledged.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong passed down the rest of his orders.

“What is the reaction of the Devil Ape Cult?” Huang Xiaolong asked before he dismissed Gao Changran.

“Replying to Your Majesty, the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor has already arrived in Frigid North City. Looking at them, they probably plan to head straight to the Eternal Devil Lands.”

Huang Xiaolong immediately understood the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s plan. He chuckled, “It seems as though he plans to wait for us there.”

“Enough. Make the preparations. We will leave in two hours!”

Gao Changran received the order and bowed once again. He left to prepare for the trip to the Eternal Devil Lands.

Two hours passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong and the rest left Six Nether City as they headed for the Eternal Devil Lands.

Since they were riding on the Netherworld King’s Flying Ship, they would arrive in the Eternal Devil Lands in three short days.

Despite all that, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bring too many people along. He only arranged for Gao Changran and another Emperor Realm ancestor from the Six Nether Gate to follow him.

Initially, Gao Mengyao had begged Gao Changran to bring her along. However, Huang Xiaolong knew that the more people they brought, the more troublesome things would get. So, he had refused her request to follow along.

Along the way, they met some resistance when they met a few other superpowers from the Devil World.

However, Huang Xiaolong blatantly ignored all of them, and he charged straight through. After all, no one could forcefully stop the Netherworld King’s Flying Ship.

Three days later...

The ship finally stopped.

The three of them emerged from the ship.

They were greeted with the sight of a massive devilish mountain, and no one knew how high it was. It had the appearance of a massive devil sword lying in the middle of a flat world.

Devil qi swirled around from the foot to the peak, and cracks in space occasionally appeared around the mountain.

There were four words carved into the body of the mountain in ancient text. “Eternal Devil Lands.”

Even though the words weren’t large, everyone who saw the mountain would be able to see the three words.

“Eternal Devil Lands...” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Even though the mountain was endless, the devil qi rolling off the four words alone was enough to suffocate anyone who approached.

“Rumor has it that the words were carved on by the Archdevil Lord using some sort of supreme enchantment. The words emit a boundless devil might, and legends are going around that a supreme beast is suppressed under the mountain.” Gao Changran said all of a sudden.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in reply.

He had heard of the rumors as well.

However, only the Archdevil Lord himself could verify the authenticity of the rumor...

No matter what, Huang Xiaolong focused on the things before him. He could see a terrifying devil array surrounding the carved words in the body of the mountain.

“No one knows when the mountain appeared, but everyone has heard that only one person could ever step foot onto the peak of the mountain. He was the Archdevil Lord of the past, and other than him, no other individual has managed to reach the peak.” The other ancestor from the Six Nether Gate, Wang Fanning, said.

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong was indeed a little surprised. This was the first time he had heard of such a legend.

Gao Changran nodded his head and continued, “There is a type of devil presence on this mountain, and if you fly towards the peak of the mountain, it will appear to grow higher and higher. I’ve heard that only by becoming the Archdevil Lord will one be able to arrive at the peak of the mountain. Some people say that the Archdevil Lord left something at the peak of the mountain when he arrived there in the past. However, no one knows what this is.”

“I would like to try.” Huang Xiaolong turned and looked at the peak of the mountain. Getting back into the flying ship, the four odd beasts controlled the flying ship to shoot towards the peak of the mountain.

However, no matter how quickly they flew, they failed to arrive at the peak. After an hour, Huang Xiaolong could only admit defeat.

The Netherworld King’s Flying Ship shot forward.

Even though they had already arrived at the Eternal Devil Lands, they were only at the outer zones. The Eternal Devil Lands was larger than a super divine plane, and the two Devil Steles were located deep in the Eternal Devil Lands.

The moment they entered, a bone piercing, soul biting chill assaulted them. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The cold was something they could protect themselves from. Even the Netherworld King’s Flying Ship wasn’t able to block it from entering their bodies.

Even someone like Huang Xiaolong had to swallow fire attributed spiritual pills to eliminate the coldness in his body.

In half a day, they finally arrived at the deeper zones of the Eternal Devil Lands. Keeping the flying ship away, the three of them hovered in mid-air. They saw a massive ancient city lying before them, and boundless devil qi surrounded it.

They weren’t mistaken. The ancient devil city was never-ending, and they failed to see the end with their eyes.
