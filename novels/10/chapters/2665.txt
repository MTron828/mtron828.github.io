Chapter 2666: Primal Ancestor Realm Beast

The dire region!

The most dangerous place on the Sky Opening Island.

This was the place Mo Zhi had repeatedly reminded Huang Xiaolong to be very careful of. When even someone like Mo Zhi had cautioned him to be careful, one could imagine how dangerous this extreme region was.

The dire region, like it’s name indicated, was all experts’ dire land!

At the mention of this dire region, the Primal Ancestors outside would pale noticeably, and even someone as strong as Mo Zhi did not dare to claim he could safely cross the dire region every time.

Many Primal Ancestor experts’ stopped here because of this dire region, unable to explore further because the risks were just too high. One needed to cross this dire region in order to enter deeper into the Sky Opening Island, and there were no shortcuts or detours around it.

Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply, and finally flew towards the dire region.

To hunt a tiger, you must enter the tiger’s lair!

Hence, he needed to brave across this dire region, and he had always been confident of his luck.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong started flying into the dire region, space rippled as Yuan Qianxing’s group of six appeared on the spot where Huang Xiaolong had stopped earlier.

“Huang Xiaolong has entered the dire region!” Yuan Qianxing’s eyes narrowed with joy despite the cold gleam that flickered across them, killing intent leaked from his body for a moment.

Not for a day had he forgotten about the shame he was subjected to on the battle stage, as he was forced to flee by Huang Xiaolong in his underpants and it was still fresh in his mind. His reputation had plummeted, and he was reduced to a laughing stock of the whole Alien Lands, a topic others entertain themselves with at the dinner table.

“We’ll make our move at the said location.” The black-robed old man stressed, “Before that, please converge your auras in case Huang Xiaolong discovers us and makes a run for it.”

“Rest assured, Elder Ming.” Everyone nodded, including Yuan Qianxing and the Myriad Origin Race’s Old Ancestor Yuan Wanfei. It was obvious that this Elder Ming was the one who made the decisions.

Silently, the six continued to trail behind Huang Xiaolong, taking the path Huang Xiaolong had taken into the dire region.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong entered the dire region space.

The moment he crossed the line into the dire region, his surroundings dimmed. This dimming was not merely in terms of light, but it felt as if some kind of grayish gaseous element dominated the surrounding space. This gray gas impeded his holy souls’ senses.

Up until he entered the dire region, his three holy souls could sense as far as a hundred thousand miles radius, but now, not even a thousand miles…

If Huang Xiaolong’s three holy souls were suppressed to this extent, then one could imagine to what degree other experts’ strength would get suppressed down to!

Weng!

Suddenly, just as Huang Xiaolong flew forward cautiously, a rather inconspicuous black dust floated to his side, and it started vibrating. In the next second, dumbfounding rays of black light appeared around him!

There was shock on Huang Xiaolong’s face upon sensing the energy these black rays contained. These black rays of light were more powerful than many Primal Ancestor experts’ attacks!

Huang Xiaolong circulated his holy energy and flickering holy light enshrouded him entirely in an instant, and in a flicker, he dodged the black light.

A ray of black light slashed through Huang Xiaolong’s right arm, cutting a ghastly wound in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback.

When his three saint godheads had evolved, so had his saint physique, and his physical body was stronger than the average First Resurrection Primal Ancestors, yet it failed to withstand the black light’s power!

After this, Huang Xiaolong did not dare to be careless anymore, taking out the Flying Heaven Spear, and waving it continuously around him.

Half an hour later, the black light that had appeared suddenly, disappeared.

Huang Xiaolong exhaled in relief, but before he finished letting out the breath, from the void beside him, a black tentacle shot out. The black tentacle was perfectly blended with the surrounding, making it hard to notice it until it was too late. By the time Huang Xiaolong noticed it, the black tentacle was merely a few meters behind him.

Huang Xiaolong immediately thrust the Flying Heaven Spear over his shoulder.

Ziiilch!

The Flying Heaven Spear pierced through the black tentacle, but the result stupefied Huang Xiaolong. The spear’s power actually failed to shatter the black tentacle, letting the black tentacle dodged away instead.

Before Huang Xiaolong knew it, the black tentacle had wrapped itself around Huang Xiaolong, tightening around him.

Huang Xiaolong subsequently saw the other end of the black tentacle, which was an ugly monster that somewhat resembled an octopus with numerous pupils and countless tentacles. Each tentacle was enormous and several miles in length.

It was a Primal Ancestor Realm sky opening beast!

A Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm at that!

It was said that the sky opening beasts were born from absorbing the xuanhuang qi from the Xuanhuang Stone that had crashed into the river. Due to the effects of xuanhuang qi, their bodies had gradually changed, turning into the sky opening beasts that exist today.

As these sky opening beasts’ bodies were gradually improved by xuanhuang qi, their physical body and bloodline had gotten stronger as well, thus sky opening beasts that had reached Primal Ancestor Realm were a nightmare. At the same level of cultivation, no human race expert, alien race expert, or river race expert could contend with a sky opening beast.

After the Primal Ancestor Realm octopus sky opening beast successfully wrapped a tentacle over Huang Xiaolong, its other tentacles began slapping Huang Xiaolong as it was intending to smash Huang Xiaolong to a pulp before swallowing him.

Huang Xiaolong pushed his three saint godheads’ powers to the extreme, twelve high-order Saint Fates flew out, and with a bellow, Huang Xiaolong broke free from the octopus sky opening beast’s fetter. Just as Huang Xiaolong managed to break free, several tentacles came smashing down where he was a split second ago, breaking the ground below.

The giant octopus shrieked sharply in anger as its many tentacles wriggled in the air, slamming towards Huang Xiaolong.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong watched coldly, holding the Flying Heaven Spear in his left hand, and his right hand giving birth to a burst of dazzling light as the Cangqiong Blade appeared.

“The Prosperity of Dragons!”

“Cangqiong Strike!”

Two ultimate moves were executed simultaneously.

Dragons appeared from Huang Xiaolong’s right palm like blossoming petals, accompanied by flickers of deathly blade qi across the air.

The giant octopus’ sharp shriek cut across the air once again in the next moment as one after another enormous tentacles segregated into several sections, cleanly cut by Huang Xiaolong’s blade qi. Blood splattered like rain. Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a blur and reappeared again right in front of the octopus with both the Flying Heaven Spear and Cangqiong Blade slashing down.

The Flying Heaven Spear and Cangqiong Blade entered and exited the octopus’s brain at the same time.

Spear force and blade qi forced through the octopus’ brain, turning it into a pulp, and Huang Xiaolong added a kick to its body, sending it flying backward as it screamed tragically.

However, after successfully hitting the octopus with two blows, Huang Xiaolong turned and sped away immediately. After all, the octopus was a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor, it would take him a lot of effort to kill the octopus. Not to mention that the movement would be too big, attracting even more sky opening beasts over. There was nothing to gain from that.

The octopus flipped over, and immediately roared in fury when it saw Huang Xiaolong speeding again. It turned into a streak of black light and started to pursue him.

A while after Huang Xiaolong and the octopus were out of sight, Yuan Qianxing’s group arrived at the scene.

“The Prosperity of Dragons?!”

“Cangqiong Strike?”

“Huang Xiaolong is really from the Holy World!” Yuan Qianxing’s expression was gloomy to the extreme.

“Could Huang Xiaolong be that cowardly old dragon’s and Cangqiong Old Man’s personal disciple at the same time?” Chan Yuli had not expected something like this.

“If that is the case, then Huang Xiaolong should die even more!” Yuan Wanfei’s icy voice was steeped with hatred. At the ancient battlefield, he was severely injured by Cangqiong Old Man, and it had taken a lot of holy pills and a long time for him to heal completely.
