Chapter 2616: Baseless Fears

Yuan Wangfeng’s heart shook once as he finally realized that the Deputy Mansion Master was taking his transgressions seriously. He lowered his head in defeat, and he whimpered, “This subordinate doesn’t dare… I was concerned for the safety of our mansion when I deployed the guardians… As a human, Huang Xiaolong dares to conspire against us to challenge the Dao Gate. His intentions are clear. He plans to obtain the position of the Mansion Master and move against our alien race!”

Long Shengtian harrumphed coldly, “Since the founding of the Otherworldly Mansion, there wasn’t a rule stating that a human couldn’t be the Mansion Master! If Huang Xiaolong conspired to take over the position as the Mansion Master, can’t I pin the same crime on your Myriad Origin Race?”

Yuan Wangfeng choked on his saliva when he heard what Long Shengtian said.

“Yuan Wangfeng, you came up with the rules for the competition. Right now, your disciple was defeated and you broke the rules you set. Does the authority and prestige of the Otherworldly Mansion mean nothing to you? Does the Mansion Master and I even matter to you?”

The look on Yuan Wangfeng’s face changed drastically, “Deputy Mansion Master, that’s not what I meant!”

“Enough. There are enough witnesses here to prove that you broke the rules of the competition after your disciple was defeated,” Long Shengtian continued with a snort, “You shall no longer be given any resources for the next one million years. If there is a next time, I will report the matter to Lord Mansion Master himself and strip you of your position as the grand hall master!”

Yuan Wangfeng wanted to find more excuses, but he managed to restrain himself before he made Long Shengtian any angrier. “I accept the punishment!” However, the hatred he had for Huang Xiaolong had reached a point of no return. If not for Huang Xiaolong, he wouldn’t be humiliated in front of so many people! His reputation as the grand hall master went down the drain after Long Shengtian scolded him in public!

After sweeping his gaze across those present, Long Shengtian declared, “I don’t think there’s a need to continue the competition. I declare Huang Xiaolong as the winner.”

Everyone stared at him with a weird expression on their faces.

“If anyone is unwilling to accept the fact, please, step out now and challenge Huang Xiaolong,” Long Shengtian continued.

As if on cue, everyone turned to stare at Feng Jiu and Feitian Longpeng.

When Feitian Longpeng noticed the weird looks on their faces, he shook his head hastily. “No, no, no. I have nothing against Huang Xiaolong being the victor of the competition!” What a joke? Even someone at Yuan Changyao’s level didn’t manage to scratch Huang Xiaolong! Even though Yuan Changyao was on his last breaths, everyone present could see that he would no longer be able to cultivate! He only had two choices. One was to reincarnate and restart his cultivation from scratch, and the other was to look for a miraculous way to recover whatever Huang Xiaolong had devoured!

Feng Jiu was no different from Feitian Longpeng. She shook her head silently.

In her heart, she knew that if she was willing to show off some of her trump cards, she would definitely be able to defeat Yuan Changyao. However, the victory would be marginal. The battle would be bloody, and she would emerge victorious after suffering serious injuries. However, Yuan Changyao couldn’t even scratch Huang Xiaolong and there was no way for her to defeat a monster of that level. If she wasn’t able to obtain the qualifications to challenge the Dao Gate this time, she could always try again ten years later.

Yuan Wangfeng, Yuan Zongyuan, Jin Kang, and the others could only rage in their hearts when they heard that Long Shengtian wasn’t going to pursue the matter. When he announced that Huang Xiaolong was the victor, the anger in their hearts burned a little brighter.

However, No one dared to speak up after seeing how Long Shengtian punished Yuan Wangfeng.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong obtained the qualifications to challenge the Dao Gate.

Before disappearing from the plaza, Long Shengtian didn’t forget to give Huang Xiaolong his blessings, “Little one, I hope you manage to comprehend the Dao Gate!”

The disciples of the Otherworldly Mansion kneeled on the ground as they sent off their Deputy Mansion Master.

As soon as Long Shengtian disappeared, Yuan Wangfeng turned to the withered corpse that was Yuan Changyao and a look of despair appeared on his face. Fire spewed out from his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, even with the Deputy Mansion Master behind you, my Myriad Origin Race will get our revenge!”

“I’ll be waiting.” ignoring the threat completely, Huang Xiaolong turned around and soared into the air.

“We should leave too…” Feng Jiu stared at Huang Xiaolong’s back, and she led the members of the Fiery Phoenix Race away. Feitian Longpeng and the members of the Flying Heaven Race left too.

As everyone streamed out of the plaza, the only ones left were members of the Twin Dragon Race, the Myriad Origin Race, and the Golden Buddha Race.

“Grand Hall Master Yuan, are we supposed to watch on as Huang Xiaolong challenges the Dao Gate?” Yuan Zongyuan spat in anger.

“Even if he manages to comprehend the Dao Gate, it doesn't matter. He will never be able to become a candidate without the support of over ten royal families!” Yuan Wangfeng growled in anger.

“As long as he isn’t a candidate for the position of the Mansion Master, we’ll be able to mess with him however we wish!”

Everyone stared at each other as traces of doubt flashed in their minds.

“Fourth uncle is getting muddled-headed. He helped a human instead of his nephew!” Long Zhenyang screamed in rage.

The experts of the Twin Dragon Race couldn’t believe their ears as a trace of fear gripped their hearts.

“Zhenyang, watch your words. It’s a heavy crime to slander the Deputy Mansion Master as a member of the Otherworldly Mansion!” Long Cheng warned as everyone else from the Twin Dragon Race chided him.

Long Zhenyang could only lower his head in defeat and apologize to the air when he realized that no one else supported him.

“Grand Hall Master Yuan, according to the rules of the mansion, disciples who enter the Dao Gate and fully comprehend the grand dao behind the workings of the gate wouldn’t need the recognition of the royal families to become a candidate!” Jin Kang thought of a terrifying possibility and the words left his mouth before he could stop them.

Everyone stared at him in horror.

That was a possibility that was too terrifying for anyone to think of.

However, Yuan Wangfeng sneered in response, “A human like him must be dreaming if he wants to comprehend the grand dao behind the Dao Gate. Even His Highness, Yuan Qianxing, wouldn’t be able to do so!”

“That’s right. Even Yuan Qianxing couldn’t comprehend the grand dao contained in the Dao Gate with his Origin Saint Godhead. Even with the top-ranked saint godhead, Yuan Qianxing couldn’t comprehend the Dao Gate, then why would Huang Xiaolong be able to do so? He only managed to comprehend 9,326 strands of grand dao. It will be a miracle if Huang Xiaolong manages to comprehend half of that, much less the entire workings of the Dao Gate!”

There were a total of ten thousand strands of grand dao contained in the Dao Gate, and one would be able to succeed if they comprehended six thousand strands. As soon as they emerged after comprehending more than six thousand strands, they would become a Mansion Master candidate after obtaining the support of more than ten royal families.

However, there was a special rule that stated that whoever managed to comprehend all ten thousand strands of grand dao, could ignore the approval of the royal families and become a Mansion Master candidate immediately!

“Huang Xiaolong is only at the early-Second Heaven True Saint Realm, and he managed to defeat Yuan Changyao with ease. We can’t underestimate his talent…” Jin Kang fell into his thoughts for a moment, and he felt a sense of unease creeping up his heart.

In the past, he would have never expected Huang Xiaolong to be able to comprehend the Dao Gate. After all, even Yuan Qianxing couldn’t do it!

But after the competition, some serious doubts were forming in his mind.

“Enough. Jin Kang, enough with your negativity,” Yuan Wangfeng snapped. “Let’s go. We have to meet with His Highness, Yuan Qianxing, immediately!”

“His Highness has locked himself in seclusion for some time now. If we visit him now, will we…?”

“No. If His Highness learns of Changyao’s treatment, he will definitely slay Huang Xiaolong as soon as he emerges from seclusion. He is probably the only person who can kill Huang Xiaolong right now!”
