Everyone was quick in picking the demonic beast they liked the most for a mount. Huang Peng and Su Yan chose the pair of Fire Scaled Beasts, whereas Shi Xiaofei and Huang Min both selected a phoenix.

‘Looks like girls have a tendency to choose phoenixes as mounts, just like boys like divine dragons.’

No doubt, the phoenixes chosen by Shi Xiaofei and Huang Min were females, otherwise, even if Shi Xiaofei wanted it, Huang Xiaolong would veto her decision. Think about it, who would allow the woman they love to sit on a male phoenix mount? Anyone would be upset.

Guo Tai, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the others also found a beast mount they liked.

What Huang Xiaolong found hilarious was that Huang Xiaohai and Guo Xiaofan, these two guys, actually picked an Armored Turtle-Dragon for themselves. Although the Armored Dragon-Turtles were descendants of the Dragon Clan, at the core they were still turtles. Their shape was no different than a sea turtle, enlarged by several thousand times.

Watching the funny picture of the two of them sitting on the Armored Dragon-Turtles, Huang Min and the rest burst out laughing, including Shi Xiaofei.

When everyone picked the mount they wanted, Huang Xiaolong ordered the Phoenix Clan and the demonic beasts to disperse around the Huang Clan Manor’s perimeter, guarding the surroundings.

This meant that the Huang Clan Manor was due for another round of expansion, a big expansion.

Though it wasn’t necessary to have all the demonic beasts and Phoenix Clan to remain in the Huang Clan Manor, it was mandatory for the Tenth Order God Realm and above to remain here, mainly because the Huang Clan Manor’s defenses were still weaker than Huang Xiaolong would have liked.

Huang Xiaolong subsequently introduced Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, Peng Dafei and his brothers, as well as the Nine-Tailed White Fox to everyone.

When Huang Xiaolong’s family and his old subordinates heard that these seven people were all Highgod Realm masters, everyone was dumbstruck.

What did a Highgod Realm master represent?

From their experience in the Cloudsea Mainland and staying in Black Warrior Institute, everyone at the Huang Clan Manor understood what it meant for a force to have a Highgod Realm master present.

A Highgod Realm master represented a super force!

A Highgod Realm master represented the highest existence in a galaxy!

Different from a God Realm cultivator who was still considered a mortal, a Highgod Realm was almost a God himself!

A God with a godhead!

Although both the Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi were also Highgod Realm masters, they were seen differently due to their identities. One was Huang Xiaolong’s Master, and the other was Shi Xiaofei’s Master.

Thus, strictly speaking, neither the Ascending Moon Old Man nor Yang Yi were part of the Huang Clan Manor’s forces. But, from now on, the Huang Clan Manor also had their own Highgod Realm masters, seven of them!

Knowing that the Phoenix Clan Ancestor and the others were all Highgod Realm masters, all of them were incredibly polite, filled with respect and admiration, referring to the seven of them as Seniors. The Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, the three Peng brothers, and Hu Xiaoxian waved their hands, flustered and not knowing how to respond.

Other people referring to them as Seniors was something matter-of-factly, but who were Huang Peng and Su Yan? Their master’s parents. In other words, their grand-masters.

However, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others insisted, thus the Phoenix Clan Ancestors and the others could only turn to Huang Xiaolong, who nodded.

To him, it was just a salutation. If his family liked it, he had no objections. After all, the Phoenix Clan Ancestors and the rest were all Highgod Realm masters, it was necessary to show some respect.

Then, everyone headed to the main hall and sat down.

Just like the Ascending Moon Old Man previously, Yang Yi, Shi Xiaofei, and in fact all of them were curious how Huang Xiaolong managed to subjugate the Phoenix Clan and the many demonic beasts.

Yang Yi was the first who couldn’t resist asking the question.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and briefly recounted the events.

When Yang Yi, Shi Xiaofei, and those in the main hall heard that Huang Xiaolong had obtained both the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires, they were astounded and amazed.

After that, Huang Xiaolong asked about the recent events in Martial Spirit World, and if the Jiang Family or the Azure Dragon Institute sent any people over to make trouble. The Ascending Moon Old Man harrumphed proudly, “With this old man here, those bastards daren’t come here and do fart.”

Huang Min pursed her lips together to control her laughter.

Yang Yi reprimanded jokingly, “Mischievous old man.”

Huang Xiaolong merely smiled. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Then again, it was true. With the old man here, it was no surprise the Azure Dragon Institute and Jiang Family didn’t dare to send people to the Martial Spirit World and cause trouble.

That night, the Huang Clan Manor was brightly lit, holding a celebration.

With the addition of the six Highgod Realm masters together with Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, it was an event worth celebrating, even more so with Huang Xiaolong obtaining two divine fires.

The celebration banquet lasted for three days and three nights.

Three days later, the Ascending Moon Old Man called for Huang Xiaolong, saying that he was going to the Vermilion Bird Galaxy’s Fire World.

Huang Xiaolong was completely stumped; did this old man really thought that he ‘picked up’ the Phoenix Clan Ancestor and the others in the Fire World?

Noticing that expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face, the Ascending Moon Old Man grumbled grumpily, “What nonsense are you thinking in your head? I’m just going to the Fire World to search for something.”

Huang Xiaolong scratched his head in an embarrassed manner, then said, “How about I go with you?”

The old man shook his head, “Although those remnant formations are powerful, I, the Ascending Moon Old Man, am not so unreliable that I need my disciple to protect me.”

Huang Xiaolong hesitated, then he asked, “Old man, are you now a Fourth Order or Fifth Order Highgod Realm?”

The Ascending Moon Old Man suddenly let out a complacent snicker, “Little brat, are you very curious about your Master’s real strength?” Just as Huang Xiaolong thought the old man would give a straight answer, his tone abruptly changed, “I’ll tell you when you breakthrough to Highgod Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong was half sulking at the answer.

The Ascending Moon Old Man added looking at Huang Xiaolong, “You’re still not strong enough. When you break through to the Highgod Realm, there’s something I want to tell you.” The old man said this with a serious expression.

Without another word, the old man already left Huang Xiaolong’s sight in a flicker.

Huang Xiaolong fell into contemplation staring at the spot where the Ascending Moon Old Man was standing moments ago. What matter did that the old man have that he would only tell him after he broke through to the Highgod Realm? Not to mention, his current strength wasn’t that weak, yet it wasn’t enough?

A few days later, Yang Yi also took her leave, claiming that she wanted to return to the land of new moon to have a look.

When Yang Yi left, Shi Xiaofei was extremely reluctant, her beautiful eyes were red and swimming in tears.

Yang Yi smiled dotingly at Shi Xiaofei, “Silly child, Master isn’t ascending to the Divine World, come visit me with Xiaolong sometimes. Of course, Master will definitely come to your wedding.”

Shi Xiaofei’s expression was heart-rending as she glanced at Huang Xiaolong.

Yang Yi also left Martial Spirit World after bidding farewell to the Huang Family, returning to the Wintry North World’s land of new moon.

After the Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi left, Huang Xiaolong instructed the Phoenix Clan and the group of demonic beasts to begin expanding the Huang Clan Manor. At the same time, Huang Xiaolong also increased the defenses around the manor.

Following this, as planned earlier, he began arranging small and big scale Spirit Amplifying Arrays throughout the kingdoms and empires throughout the Martial Spirit World. Naturally, Huang Xiaolong need not do this himself, he taught the arrangement method to the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, the three Peng brothers, and the Nine-Tailed White Fox and sent them off.

At the same time, in the Black Warrior Institute’s Wuhuang Peak, Vice Institute Principal Wang Na received news that the Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi had left Martial Spirit World.

Grand Elder Chen Shi that was sitting across Wang Na snickered, “Go inform the Golden Horned Beast King and Azure Dragon Institute’s people, tell them the Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi have left Martial Spirit World. The Xuanji Treasure goes to them, but the Hailstone Treasure is ours!”
