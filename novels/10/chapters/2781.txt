Chapter 2782: Guesses and Suspicions

Those standing around felt a sense of fear deep in their hearts when they saw the golden rain of blood. There were four hundred experts of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land standing before the man! Every single one of them was in the Primal Ancestor Realm!

As Primal Ancestors, every drop of their blood contained grand dao energy. As such, their blood was also known as grand dao blood.

To Primal Ancestors, a drop of grand dao blood was nothing more than trash. However, the same drop would be considered a treasure by True Saint Realm experts. It was a spiritual treasure better than most spiritual herbs! Right now, the blood of tons of Primal Ancestors was raining down from the skies and staining the ground golden-red. Such a precious treasure was wasted in the hands of Huang Xiaolong.

Yi Xiaotang didn’t move, and neither did Aunt Qing.

The experts at the side, who were watching the battle, remained motionless, and they didn’t dare to breathe loudly.

Their gazes were locked on Huang Xiaolong, who was dripping in golden blood.

After the bloody mist finally dissipated, Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and dragged Chen Sen and the others out from the ground. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re nothing more than a loser who relies on a formation world to deal with us! If you’re really capable, fight us outside!” Chen Sen roared as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “You’re just an ant in the True Saint Realm. If we ever cross paths again, you’re going to be in deep sh*t!”

As the Patriarch of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land, Chen Sen was defeated by a True Saint Realm brat! He felt utterly humiliated by it.

In his eyes, Huang Xiaolong had borrowed the power of his formation world to deal with them, but the truth was that they had lost.

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he felt too lazy to speak to them. With a wave of his hand, a purple light entered the bodies of Chen Sen and the others. Sealing up the energy in their bodies, Huang Xiaolong threw all of them into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

As he swept his gaze across the others, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lingered a little longer when he looked at Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing. However, he tore a hole in the space and disappeared from where he stood.

Even after a long time he had left, no one dared to leave. They stared at the holes in the ground in silence as thoughts ran through their minds.

“It ended just like that?!” someone gasped.

Initially, everyone had felt that the members of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land would crush Huang Xiaolong easily, but the outcome was completely outside their expectations.

Only after an extraordinarily long time did some people start to leave.

When most of the spectators had left, Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing slowly approached the space above the holes in the ground.

Complicated thoughts swam through her mind when she saw the bottomless holes in the ground.

As for Aunt Qing, she became even more puzzled as she tried to look for traces of the formation world Huang Xiaolong was borrowing his strength from.

“Aunt Qing, did you discover anything?” Yi Xiaotang asked.

As she shook her head, a trace of suspicion flashed in Aunt Qing’s eyes, and she responded, “That’s weird… There are no traces of a formation being laid down in here.”

“The holes in the ground aren't an illusion...” Yi Xiaotang continued.

Looking at each other, they thought of a terrifying possibility.

“There’s no way... “ Yi Xiaotang muttered, “There’s no traces of formation world here!”

Wouldn’t that mean…

Aunt Qing’s expression changed.

“Impossible!” Aunt Qing screamed in shock. “Isn’t Huang Xiaolong just a True Saint? How can he defeat so many Primal Ancestors?!”

“It’s impossible… Unless he’s at the late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!”

A weird expression formed on Yi Xiaotang’s face. “Did he really suppress his cultivation realm? He might be a late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor! In fact, he might even be at the peak of the late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!”

Aunt Qing was stunned for a second, but she shook her head slowly. “That’s not possible. He’s definitely a Ninth Heaven True Saint. If he has really reached the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, our Blue Heaven Dao Clairvoyance will definitely detect him.”

Yi Xiaotang raised her head suddenly, and she muttered, “Let’s return to the Blue Heaven Creed. I have to report this to my father!”

The situation that had just played out was too weird. Perhaps it was only possible to deduce something if her father, the Blue Heaven Dao Venerable, personally verified the matter.

It didn’t take long for the two of them to leave the place.

After they left, several figures emerged from the void, and they were Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors from Sea Mountain Sacred Land. Qian Haishan was part of them.

A look of disbelief could be seen on their faces as soon as they appeared.

“Patriarch, do you think that there’s a god of formations behind Huang Xiaolong? Did he really borrow the power of the formation world to deal with them?” one of the experts asked.

They had long since arrived at the scene, but they had remained hidden in the void. None of them had made a move as they had watched the battle from the start to the end.

Remaining silent, Qian Haishan went over to the place Huang Xiaolong had once stood and a trace of doubt flashed in his eyes. If he was being honest, he trusted what he saw. He felt that Huang Xiaolong haddn’t relied on a formation world to crush his opponents.

However, the brat was only a Ninth Heaven True Saint!

How could a Ninth Heaven True Saint defeat several hundred Primal Ancestors alone?! Also, how in the world was he be able to send an Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor flying with a single punch?

With his eyebrows locked tightly together, the battle that had happened previously flashed in his mind.

“Patriarch, are we still going to the Cangqiong Sacred Land?” someone asked when he saw that Qian Haishan was silent.

Previously, they had been hunting Huang Xiaolong down, but he had managed to escape, and according to their plans, they were going to head over to Cangqiong Sacred Land to vent their anger out.

“We’ll put the plan on hold for now…” Qian Haishan muttered.

…

After leaving uninhabited land, Huang Xiaolong didn’t return to Cangqiong Sacred Land. Instead, he went to Nine Resurrections Sacred Land.

The reason he headed over there was because of their treasury. Since they ranked in the top thirties in Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, their accumulated wealth over the years would be a terrifying amount. They definitely had more items than the treasuries of the Tang Long, Freezing Desert, and the Chufan Sacred Land. In fact, if he added everything from the three sacred lands, it wouldn’t be comparable to the treasury of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land!

When he opened the treasury after arriving, Huang Xiaolong was stunned even with his experience.

Staring at the mountain of treasures around him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t know what to say. The spiritual stones and spiritual herbs could form a continent on their own. The amount was several tens of times more than anything he had plundered in the past.

As he was sweeping up everything in Nine Revolutions Sacred Land, the battle between Huang Xiaolong, Chen Sen, and the others spread through the lands. The entire Saint Devil Heavenly Cave trembled as discussions about Huang Xiaolong’s strength flew all over the place.

“There’s a great formations master supporting Cangqiong Sacred Land?! It’s no wonder they managed to defeat the armies of the three sacred grounds…”

“Even Nine Revolutions Sacred Land was no match for them! Who would dare to set their sights on Cangqiong Sacred Land?! Isn’t it said that Cangqiong Old Man and Huang Xiaolong came from the same holy world? Could the formation master behind them have come from the same holy world?!”
