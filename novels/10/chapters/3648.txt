Chapter 3649: Personally Meet You

The faces of the eminent elders from the Jian Family changed.

All of a sudden, a burst of sword qi came from Huang Xiaolong. It was countless times stronger that the sword qi Jian Chao formed earlier. Before anyone could react, the sword qi sank deep into Jian Chao’s body.

As a half-step Universe God, there was absolutely no chance he could remain standing even if Huang Xiaolong unleashed a casual attack. As a miserable cry left his lips, he was flung out of the tea house and he crashed heavily into the streets.

The experts along the streets jumped in fright.

They weren’t the only ones who were shocked. The members of the Jian Family who came over to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson stared at him, dumbfounded. When his sword qi shot by them, they noticed that it was so quick they couldn’t react!

Jian Shengdong’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.

“You… You know Han’er?” Jian Shengdong asked slowly.

Tao Hang stepped forward in response. “I am Tao Han’er’s foster father!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The crowd started to clamor the moment the words left his lips.

“Han’er? The princess of the Jian Family, Tao Han’er? Is that for real?”

“I heard that Princess Han’er was found in the Hengshan Mountain Range in the Qiankun Celestial Empire. Before she was found, she had been wandering the world for hundreds of thousands of years… It’s definitely possible that she has a foster father…”

The news was too damn explosive!

Jian Shengdong turned to look at Tao Hang with shock in his eyes.

As one of the higher ups of the Jian Family, he knew that Tao Han’er had a foster father in the Limitless Lands. He never thought that they would be meeting in such a situation. Moreover, he never expected Tao Hang to arrive at the Zhu Lan Lands. After all, he was a mere Dao Venerable. There was no way he could cross the Nightless Sea to reach the Zhu Lan Lands.

Hesitation filled his heart.

“Lord Shengdong?” The other half-step Universe God asked carefully and the members of the Jian Family stared at their eminent elder.

“How much?” Jian Shengdong finally broke the silence after a long time.

Everyone gasped when they realized that Jian Shengdong was getting ready to pay the Zhu Family Tea House.

Zhu Fei looked at the grand elder of the Zhu Family and the grand elder stuttered, “36… 36.8 billion and 93.21 million dao coins…”

Reaching into his spatial artifact, Jian Shengdong realized that he only brought close to 10 billion with him. After all, none of them thought that they were actually going to pay the money.

Jian Shengdong looked at the other eminent elders of the Jian Family. After they searched through their spatial artifacts, they took out the cash with much difficulty.

After they were done, they went to pick up Jian Chao before leaving with their tails tucked between their legs.

As for the three grand elders, they retrieved the bodies of the other two before following behind the God of Creation Realm experts on their side.

Those standing around looked at each other in confusion. They clearly didn’t expect such an outcome.

…

“What?! Jian Shengdong escaped?!” Zhu Jian exclaimed.

Zhu Yun hesitated for a second before explaining, “When Jian Shengdong learned that the slave beside the brat was Tao Han’er’s foster father, he paid without a word and left with the experts of the Jian Family.

A frown formed on Zhu Jian’s face. “So… he let the brat go because of Han’er?”

“Not really…” Zhu Yun lowered his head and muttered, “I heard that the kid defeated Jian Chao.”

“The kid defeated a half-step Universe God of the Jian Family?!” Zhu Jian’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“Yes. He used a single strand of sword qi to defeat the man...” Zhu Yun explained the situation to his young master.

After learning that Huang Xiaolong not only took Jian Chao’s sword qi head on without suffering any injuries and defeated the half-step Universe God in one strike, his expression started to fluctuate. “That would mean that the kid is an expert who broke through the 10 billion units mark…”

Zhu Yun raised his head to gauge Zhu Jian’s mood before replying, “That seems to be so…”

Jian Chao might be a half-step Universe God, but he possessed extraordinary combat abilities. Even so, he failed to withstand a single strike from the kid!

After learning of Huang Xiaolong’s strength, Zhu Jian’s expression turned extremely dark. “No wonder he dares to act all arrogant… Where’s my father?”

Zhu Yun bowed, “Lord Mei Jie is currently exchanging pointers with Lord Jian Wushuang and Lord Gui Chi in the Jian Family!”

“Tell me when he returns.” Zhu Jian growled.

“Yes, Young Master!”

After Jian Shengdong left the tea house, he returned to the Jian Family immediately. When they saw Jian Weifeng, he saw Jian Bifei whispering something into his ear.

“Blue Dragon Young Master?!” A deep look appeared in Jian Weifeng’s eyes after hearing what his son said.

Jian Shengdong and the rest wanted to make their report but they were interrupted by him. “I already know what happened in the tea house…”

The news had long since spread around the city while Jian Shengdong was making his way back.

From the part where Tao Han’er’s foster father was revealed to the world and Jian Chao was sent flying with a single strike… He heard everything.

Jian Bifei continued, “Father, I also heard that the Blue Dragon Young Master has some sort of relationship with Yu Xiaohong!”

“Oh?” Jian Weifeng was slightly taken aback at the news. “Is that true?”

“Yes. Yu Xiaohong managed to return from the Bewilderment Island and someone saw them together.” Jian Bifei bowed. “Looks like their relationship is pretty good. The two of them seem intimate with each other too!”

“Intimate?” Killing intent raged in Jian Weifeng’s heart all of a sudden.

Achieving his goal, a smile secretly formed on Jian Bifei’s face.

“The brat injured me previously, and arrogantly declared that he would personally show up during the ceremony tomorrow.” Jian Bifei added.

With his eyes narrowing, Jian Weifeng growled, “Alright, I’ll personally meet the kid tomorrow!”

…

After Jian Shengdong and his men left, Huang Xiaolong returned to the courtyard to comprehend the sword manual.

After the incident, the Zhu Family Tea House’s business boomed.

The night passed eventually, and dawn broke. The ceremony was about to begin!
