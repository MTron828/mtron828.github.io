Chapter 2717: You’re Irritating

A look of despair formed on Lin Xiaoying’s face when she heard what they wanted to do to Huang Xiaolong.

“Xiaoying, relax. Nothing bad will happen to our master and Xiaolong,” Tan Juan comforted her.

Cao Nan sneered in response. “Heh, little girl, you’re too naive. Geniuses like Huang Xiaolong will never be allowed to live! The three lords have already said that they would capture Huang Xiaolong and torture him for eternity! Since he can’t be killed, they’ll cripple him and force him to endure a life worse than death!”

“Heh heh, Huang Xiaolong’s end will be much worse than yours!” Cao Nan snorted.

When he thought of how Huang Xiaolong would suffer at the hands of the three lords, Cao Nan felt a wave of joy rushing through his heart.

He wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong for a long time. However, he was never able to! Now, several formidable beings had appeared out of nowhere and promised to deal with this thorn in his side!

Even though he didn’t know where the Chaos Essence Holy World the three lords spoke of was located, he knew that the three of them were extremely strong. After witnessing the cruel methods of torture the three lords possessed, Cao Nan had even started to feel sorry for Huang Xiaolong!

When he was gloating over his victory, Huang Xiaolong and the others had already entered deep into the Holy World.

“Xiaolong, look at that!” The Heavenly Master spoke all of a sudden.

When everyone turned to stare at the location he pointed to, they saw a massive army waiting for them.

Qiao Jinyang and Gu Tian were standing behind Chi Dao and the other two, but Cao Nan was nowhere to be seen.

Huang Xiaolong stared at them with a placid expression.

He had discovered them long before the Heavenly Master.

And when the Primal Ancestors of the Holy World discovered Chi Dao and the others, the expression on their faces changed. They knew that Huang Xiaolong was strong, but they had never seen him in action before. Their fear was understandable as they had experienced the terror of Chi Dao and the other two.

Xue Lingyun fared the worst. When Liu Wuji turned his lusty gaze towards her, she hid behind Huang Xiaolong like a startled rabbit.

A sneer formed on Liu Wuji’s lips as a sinister chuckle left his lips.

As for Chi Dao and He Yi, the one-eyed expert, they swept their gazes across everyone present only to discover that Duan Feng was missing. A trace of suspicion formed in their hearts.

“Where’s Duan Feng?” He Yi asked. “Bring him out here right now. There’s no point in hiding. We’ll be able to drag him out no matter where he hides.”

The Heavenly Master and the others were stunned for a moment.

Something clicked in their heads when they realized that Chi Dao and He Yi were expecting Duan Feng to sneak-attack them like they had done to him.

“Lord Duan Feng isn’t here!” Xue Lingyun suppressed the fear in her heart, and she yelled, “Xiaolong is enough to take care of all of you!”

Xiaolong?

Chi Dao, He Yi, and Liu Wuji failed to catch her meaning, but they slowly turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong. Laughter rang through the skies as Liu Wuji exclaimed, “Xiaolong? Are you referring to Huang Xiaolong?! Hahahaha! Isn’t he just a little b*tch in the True Saint Realm? He hasn’t even grown out the hair on his body!”

Chi Dao and He Yi shook their heads silently in response.

The three of them were naturally able to see that Huang Xiaolong was only an Eighth Heaven True Saint.

They didn’t know where Xue Lingyun got her confidence from.

However, a trace of doubt soon formed in their minds. It was possible this was the tactic the other side was planning to use. They would divert all their attention to Huang Xiaolong while Duan Feng would appear out of nowhere to sneak-attack them!

Chi Dao snickered coldly.

It’s not a bad plan...

Since the Heavenly Master and the others were standing beside Huang Xiaolong, the three high-level Primal Ancestors didn’t realize that Huang Xiaolong was the one calling the shots!

Instead of replying to them, Huang Xiaolong asked a question of his own, “Were you the one who attacked the Blue Dragon Manor?” He turned to glare at Liu Wuji.

Liu Wuji was taken aback for a moment when he was singled out, but he soon started laughing. “That’s right! I was the one who exterminated the entire manor with a single strike! Hahaha! Brat, the formation around the manor was a little too weak! I managed to shatter it with a single punch!” His expression sank all a sudden as he growled at Huang Xiaolong, “Brat, the way you speak is really irritating!”

He had long since wanted to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson when Xue Lingyun had hidden behind him.

With the addition of how Huang Xiaolong spoke to him, he became extremely annoyed.

“I just decided on something. I’ll crush you first!” As soon as Liu Wuji spoke, he decided to make his move.

However, he hadn’t even raised his arm when a figure appeared before him. A punch was sent flying towards his face at a speed he couldn’t fathom. When he finally realized what was happening, he discovered that the little True Saint Realm runt he was looking down on had made a move on him!

Bang!

No matter how quickly he managed to react, Huang Xiaolong’s punch landed squarely on his face.

With his mind going blank, he was sent flying.

Under the shocked gazes of Chi Dao and the giant army they brought with them, Liu Wuji tore through the skies and slammed into one of the distant holy grounds. Not stopping there, his body pierced through the entire continent as he crashed into another block of land in the distance.

Everyone felt their jaws dropping in fright.

Qiao Jinyang, Gu Tian, and even the Primal Ancestors who returned with Huang Xiaolong couldn’t believe their eyes.

A single punch from Huang Xiaolong sent a high-level Primal Ancestor flying!

No one had ever seen anyone who managed to accomplish such a feat with a single punch.

“You!” Chi Dao and the others were shocked and killing intent rose in their hearts. Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, they realized that even if the two of them joined hands, they wouldn’t be able to do what Huang Xiaolong just did.

The shock clouded their brains as they didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong managed to blow Liu Wuji away with his strength.

All the experts who chose to betray the Holy World couldn’t believe their eyes.

As they were trying to justify Huang Xiaolong’s combat prowess, a figure appeared beside them as a flash of light descended. The Cangqiong Blade and the Flying Heaven Spear appeared and pierced towards the two high-level Primal Ancestors.

Like a blade that sundered the heavens, the starry skies were torn in two.

Snapping back to attention, the two of them burst forth with all their might to defend themselves. “Bang!”

A dull thud was heard as the light tore through the skies. A miserable shriek soon followed as a pillar of blood shot through the skies. Faring a little better than He Yi, Chi Dao was sent flying while He Yi was sent crashing into a supercontinent in the distance.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Even though he didn’t pierce through it like Liu Wuji, he was smashed directly into the middle of the continent!

When the traitors of the Holy World noticed what had happened, they felt the world spinning around them. Qiao Jinyang sucked in a cold breath, and he felt as though he was submerged into a tank of freezing cold water.

Stopping after he retreated several hundred million miles, Chi Dao felt a sharp pain shooting through his arm as the grand dao energy in his body rolled about recklessly.

He wanted to spit out a mouthful of blood, but he couldn’t no matter how hard he tried.

Slowly raising his head to look at Huang Xiaolong, he finally realized that whatever Xue Lingyun had said was true. A trace of fear flashed in his eyes.
