Chapter 3146: 13 Elements

Black Tortoise, Vermilion, White Tiger, and Azure Dragon, the four divine fires’ spirits, flew in circles around Huang Xiaolong.

With every circle the four divine fires’ spirits completed, four balls of crystal-clear and mysterious energy entered Huang Xiaolong’s body.

This went on for half a year.

The four divine fire spirits returned to Huang Xiaolong’s body, but it was more than ten days later when Huang Xiaolong finally opened his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong looked around and then checked his own condition, and ended up surprised. The moment he was struck by the beast’s blow, Huang Xiaolong had thought that he was dead for sure!

He’s still alive?

After being hit by that blow, Huang Xiaolong had fallen unconscious, as if his dao soul had flown out of the Huang Long World, drifting in the boundless universe. At one point, four balls of warm light had enveloped him from head to toe, giving him the feeling of being reborn in the universe. He had woken up after that, like he had merely taken a nap, feeling comfortable and rejuvenated all over.

Huang Xiaolong also checked his body internally, and after confirming there were no hidden injuries, he set his gaze in the direction of the Tree of Origin. He flew towards the Tree of Origin without delay.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong saw the outline of the Tree of Origin on the horizon, as well as the supercontinent, and not forgetting the behemoth beast that was absorbing origin qi from the Tree of Origin.

Though half a year passed, and still the behemoth beast had yet to fully recover. That last move had taken a serious toll on it. Only fifty percent of its cosmos energy had recovered.

It seemed to have sensed something, and it looked up. When it saw Huang Xiaolong, its ocean-sized pupils clearly showed astonishment, “You’re not dead?!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted, “What do you think?”

The behemoth beast’s face sank, “You’d better scram now as the Epoch’s Collapse that I used before is not at my full force!”

“I’m waiting to see how powerful your full force Epoch’s Collapse could be.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. He could see that the beast was merely trying to frighten him, and that attack from before was already its most powerful trump card.

KILL!

Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a blur, holding the Huang Long Twin Blades in his hands and attacking the beast.

……

Another decade passed.

Huang Xiaolong’s minor completion level power of radiance finally advanced to major completion level! On top of that, his minor completion power of darkness also reached the peak of minor completion.

Although the advancement seemed negligible, when eleven elements' energies combined, Huang Xiaolong’s attack power increased by ten percent!

Before, Huang Xiaolong had already touched the threshold of the power of time and space, though he had yet to be able to comprehend the two powers, he had one foot into the door.

Compared to Huang Xiaolong’s improvement in strength, there were more new scars on the beast’s body, and its exhausted cosmos energy couldn’t recover to the optimum state. Instead, its strength had dropped.

The decades passed by.

On this day, a light suddenly enveloped Huang Xiaolong’s body, and a new color of light joined the other eleven colors! Twelve resplendent colors of absolute powers! The power of absolute space!

This was light condensed out of the power of absolute space. A while back, Huang Xiaolong had one foot in the door, but now he entered through the door and grasped the power of absolute space. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Seeing the additional light around Huang Xiaolong, the behemoth beast’s face became gloomier, and there was disbelief in its eyes. It had lived there for countless years, and all of its days were spent comprehending the thirteen energies. He had only succeeded in comprehending the power of absolute space with the help of the Tree of Origin, yet Huang Xiaolong had done it in less than a hundred years!

Its face became distorted.

Huang Xiaolong, who had comprehended the power of absolute space, was stronger than before, whereas, its cosmos energy had been exhausted to a startling point in the last few decades. There were scars and injuries all over its body. Its strength now was less than sixty percent compared to the time it had first met Huang Xiaolong, and although there was still a long way before Huang Xiaolong could defeat it, it was only a matter of time before he traded places with Huang Xiaolong and became one being abused!

Should it retreat now?

But it was extremely unwilling to leave, and it still needed the Tree of Origin’s origin qi to cultivate all thirteen elements' energies to perfection level. Currently, only seven out of thirteen elements had reached perfection level. When all thirteen elements' energies reached perfection, even the God of Creation wouldn’t be able to kill it!

Thirteen elements at perfection level would make him the peak of the peak!

Below the existence of the God of Creation, it would be invincible!

At that time, if the God of Creation Huang Long did not appear in the Huang Long World, it would be the most powerful being!

In the split second, when the beast thought of cultivating all thirteen elements to perfection level, lights flashed, and Huang Xiaolong’s attack had arrived before its eyes.

It barely dodged the twin blades’ attack and shouted, “Wait!”

Huang Xiaolong’s movements stopped.

“Your Highness Son of Creation, since you want the Tree of Origin to cultivate with its origin qi, you can enter the continent and cultivate under it. I can vow not to attack you during this time.”

The behemoth beast went on, “We don’t need to fight endlessly as there’s no benefit for you and me continuing this!”

Huang Xiaolong listened with a cold expression, not saying a word.

The beast frowned. “I know that you want to take away the Tree of Origin. However, the Tree of Origin has completely integrated, becoming one entity with this continent and there is no way to separate them. Moreover, this piece of continent was born from an unknown material, and it cannot be taken away. Therefore, you won’t be able to take away the Tree of Origin.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second, but then, he responded indifferently, “Just because you couldn’t take away the Tree of Origin does not mean I can’t take it away.”

And Huang Xiaolong had the confidence, because he had the Huang Long Bloodline. It was the same way he had taken away the Purple Lightning Peak.

“In short, you’re adamant to take away the Tree of Origin?” Cold glints flickered across the beast’s eyes.

“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong’s determination could be heard from his tone. “Honestly, you can submit to me and follow me, and that way, you can still cultivate under the Tree of Origin.”

The beast was dumbfounded by Huang Xiaolong’s words.

In the next moment, its face sank and its gaze showed hostility. “Want me to submit to you?” Its tone clearly mocked Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t waste anymore time with words, and swung out the Huang Long Twin Blades.

Several years passed, Huang Xiaolong was once again fully enveloped by another burst of light as another color of light was added to the twelve around him! Thirteen kinds of light!

He had finally comprehended the last of the thirteen elements, the power of time.

The moment Huang Xiaolong comprehended all thirteen elements of powers, the might of Huang Long Bloodline in him swept out like an erupting volcano, and it was majestic and indomitable!

The beast’s movement stagnated before this heavenly might, and there was astonishment on its face. It was astonished that Huang Xiaolong had comprehended the power of time, and it was even more shocked that the pressure coming off Huang Xiaolong’s body had risen to this degree upon comprehending all thirteen powers!

It has risen more than ten times!

Seeing Huang Xiaolong was on the verge of attacking again, the beast yelled in a fluster, “You can take away this Tree of Origin, and I will follow by your side! But I won’t submit to you, and you have to swear that I can cultivate under the Tree of Origin. What say you?!”
