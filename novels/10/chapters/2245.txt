Chapter 2246: Holy Alliance

Three months went by in the blink of an eye.

During these three months, Huang Xiaolong’s strength rose further.

Being picked up for the journey to the Holy Gate headquarters this time was the Beast Emperor Sect’s Young Lord Song Shaokang. Song Shaokang was the Holy Gate’s new disciple. Thus he too was required to report at the Holy Gate headquarters.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong slept in a first-class cabin on the flying ship while Song Shaokang could only sleep in the lowest class cabin.

Originally, as a new Holy Gate disciple, it was unlikely Song Shaokang would be arranged at the lowest class cabin, but the Holy Gate branch’s custodian had deliberately arranged Song Shaokang so.

The grudge between Song Shaokang and Huang Xiaolong was no longer a secret at this point, and the branch’s custodian was trying to please Huang Xiaolong with this action.

When Du Gen learned about it, he merely smiled and left it at that.

“Your Highness, we’re here!”

After three months’ journey, the flying ship stopped in midair as Du Gen informed Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, and alighted the flying ship together with Du Gen.

Needless to say, Song Shaokang was the last person to get off.

After getting off the flying ship, a venomous light flickered across Song Shaokang’s eyes as he briefly glanced at Huang Xiaolong’s back.

That time at the Falling Jade Division, Huang Xiaolong had made him kneel for a full month!

As a disciple of the Holy Gate, he was supposed to enjoy days of supreme glory, but because of Huang Xiaolong, he had become the laughing stock of the entire Falling Jade Dynasty’s forces.

The root of his humiliation was Huang Xiaolong!

On top of that, because of Huang Xiaolong, the Falling Jade Dynasty Emperor and Nine Heavens Gate had used his mistake as an excuse to suppress the Beast Emperor Sect. Under these forces’ suppression, the Beast Emperor Sect had faced difficulties in everything they had done in the last few months.

Huang Xiaolong, just wait! Song Shaokang inwardly vowed with boiling hatred.

Huang Xiaolong, who was walking at the front of the group, sensed the hatred coming from Song Shaokang, but he treated it indifferently.

When Huang Xiaolong, Zhang Wenyue, and the others were getting off the flying ship, the sight of undulating grand palaces and buildings that stretched as far as the horizon in front of them took their breaths away.

However, having most of Wan Zhuoyuan’s memories, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t as awed as Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and Prince Qian.

Huang Xiaolong was aware that what they were seeing now was merely the tip of the iceberg of the whole Holy Gate headquarters. This was merely the outer periphery of the Holy Gate headquarters’ mountain range.

The Holy Gate headquarters was immense in size. Even a late-Tenth Order Venerable like Du Gen wouldn’t be able to reach the other end of the Holy Gate headquarters in ten days of flying.

While the trio was still in awe at the sight before them, a group of experts flew out from the mountain closest to them. All of them were Holy Gate headquarters’ experts who had entered Venerable Realm.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over them, and he noted that someone from every hall of the Holy Gate’s headquarters had come out.

A new Holy Prince had arrived at the headquarters, and a representative from each hall had come to welcome. It was a way of exhibiting goodwill.

Right at the head of the group was a sturdy-built middle-aged man, with a face full of coarse beard, and spirited eyes that were bigger than Du Gen’s. Other people did not dare to look at him directly in the eyes.

“Calamitous Divine Pupils!”

The Calamitous Divine Pupils was one of the more powerful kinds of divine pupils. Although it was lacking in comparison to a saint physique, it threw most kinds of divine physiques in the dust.

Huang Xiaolong knew that this person was the Holy Gate headquarters’ Chief Hall Masters, Yang Jingzhi.

Yang Jingzhi, a semi-True Saint!

Behind Yang Jingzhi were the Hall Masters of each hall, and behind them were each hall’s enforcers, high custodians, and custodians.

Upon seeing Yang Jingzhi arrive, Du Gen promptly bowed in salute, “Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent’s Branch Master Du Gen greets Lord Hall Master Yang Jingzhi!”

Despite being the Forceful Heavenly Continent’s branch master, Du Gen was considered to be under the jurisdiction of Yang Jingzhi’s management as the Chief Hall Masters.

Following Du Gen were the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent’s enforcers, Song Shaokang, Zheng Wenyue, and the rest, all kneeling to salute Yang Jingzhi.

At this time, Yang Jingzhi took a large step forward, and knelt on a single knee in front of Huang Xiaolong, “Holy Gate’s Chief Hall Masters Yang Jingzhi greets Your Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong!”

The Hall Masters, enforcers, high custodians, and custodians behind Yang Jingzhi dropped to their knees in a heartbeat and saluted Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong approached and lightly helped Yang Jingzhi up by the arm. Then, he had the Hall Masters, enforcers, and custodians stand up. Following that, Yang Jingzhi also permitted Du Gen and his group to stand as well.

“Your Highness Holy Prince, you must be tired after such a long journey here. I’ll arrange for the people below to lead you and Branch Master Du Gen to your accommodations. The second test will be held in three days.” Yang Jingzhi courteously mentioned his arrangements for Huang Xiaolong.

“That is fine.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement. To him, no matter when the second test took place, it didn’t make any difference.

The Holy Gate headquarters’ large ancient array for testing could accurately determine which kind of complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique Huang Xiaolong had. Huang Xiaolong himself was curious what his Holy Dragon Complete Dao Saint Godhead ranked now, as well as his saint bloodline and saint physique.

Although he still would seal off his other two complete dao saint godheads during the second test, as long as he learned the ranking of his Holy Dragon Complete Dao Saint Godhead, then his other complete dao saint godheads’ rankings wouldn’t differ too much.

With Huang Xiaolong’s agreement, Yang Jingzhi led the group into the Holy Gate headquarters, and arranged for the palace Huang Xiaolong’s group would be staying in. Yang Jingzhi inquired if Huang Xiaolong had any orders before taking his leave.

“Young Master, this palace is too big!” After Yang Jingzhi and his group left, Zhang Wenyue sighed repeatedly in admiration as she frolicked around the place with bright sparkling eyes.

It was as Zhang Wenyue mentioned, though it was merely Huang Xiaolong’s temporary accommodation, the palace was large and spacious that one could not see all of it at a glance. The scope was bigger than what Zhang Wenyue and the others had imagined.

Moreover, the palace was built with materials unknown to them. Just standing outside of the palace, Zhang Wenyue could already feel the brimming spiritual energy.

Huang Xiaolong issued a low chuckle, and said, “Wait until I’m done with the second test. Our palace will be bigger and better than this.

“Come on, let’s go in!”

Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the palace accommodation arranged for them. There was a mountain in the deeper regions of the Holy Gate headquarters that was as straight as a pine, and its peak pierced into the dense clouds of holy spiritual qi. Moreover, the holy spiritual qi that formed these clouds had a high quality of purity, and it was better than the holy spiritual qi Huang Xiaolong’s three complete dao saint godheads had absorbed from the void.

A cluster of grand palaces decorated the mountain peak. Each palace was built with the Holy Gate’s most precious spirit jades, stones, and irons.

Inside the main palace was a group of young men clad in the Holy Gate’s brocade robes, laughing and talking, enjoying themselves. This group consisted of fifteen Holy Princes. On the table before each Holy Prince was precious Holy World’s spiritual liquid that high-level Venerable experts had only heard of.

The Holy Prince seated at the center at the head of the banquet was clad in a golden black battle robe, enshrouded in a layer of golden flames, and he naturally exuded a regal air.

“I’ve heard that Huang Xiaolong has already arrived at our Holy Gate headquarters.” The Holy Prince seated at the head of the hall, clad in golden black battle robe stated in a lazy drawl. The aura from his body was actually stronger than the Chief Hall Masters Yang Jingzhi.

One of the Holy Princes with crimson eyes seated further down snickered nonchalantly, “Judging from the scene report, when the kid was taking the test in the Falling Jade Division, his complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique, definitely would not rank in the top four thousand. This level of talent only qualifies to carry Senior Brother Jiang Tian’s shoes or lead the mount!”

The Holy Prince clad in a golden black battle robe, named Jiang Tian, smiled faintly hearing that. Then, he turned and spoke to the third Holy Prince closest to him, “Since this Huang Xiaolong’s surname is also Huang, I’ll trouble Junior Brother Huang Zhouping to help me bring a gift to him, and ask if he is interested in joining my Holy Alliance.”

The Holy Prince named Huang Zhouping quickly accepted, “Please rest assured, Senior Brother Jiang Tian, I will ensure the gift arrives, and Senior Brother Jiang Tian’s sacred order is conveyed.”
