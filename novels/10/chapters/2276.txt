Chapter 2277: The Jiang Family’s Birthday Banquet

Feng Tianyu looked even more awkward at Huang Xiaolong’s meaningful chuckle and hastened to explain, “I am telling the truth. I only accepted her as a disciple based on her potential. Although she does not have a complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, or saint physique, her godhead was infinitely close to a saint godhead. It’s the Raging Lightning Godhead! Both her divine bloodline and divine physique are as good as the Raging Lightning Godhead.”

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely a little surprised.

Raging Lightning Godhead? In that case, that female disciple’s talent was indeed quite good.

In the Holy World, there were some powerful godheads that were known as second-to-saint godheads. Amongst them was the Raging Lightning Godhead, and it was extremely suited to cultivate Feng Tianyu’s 33 Heavens Race’s technique.

“In that case, we’ll head over to the Jiang Family to pick her up.” Huang Xiaolong answered seriously.

Since he had come across this matter, he couldn’t avoid interfering.

“That, Brother Huang, the Jiang Family is the most powerful family in the Central Holy Dynasty, and the Chen Family can’t even begin to compare. Furthermore, during this time, various sect and family forces are arriving in droves to participate in the Jiang Family’s forefather’s birthday banquet. There are many experts gathering at the Jiang Family, why don’t we...?” Hearing what Huang Xiaolong said, Feng Tianyu was once again struck by uncertainty and hesitation.

The Jiang Family’s power made him hesitate and anxious. Feng Tianyu feared they might fail to rescue his beloved disciple and drag Huang Xiaolong into danger.

Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly as he reassured, “It’ll be fine, I’ve been thinking of paying the Jiang Family a visit.”

Huh? Feng Tianyu was dazed.

Just as Huang Xiaolong decided to head to the Jiang Family with Feng Tianyu, he saw the several hundred people, who were enslaved by the Chen Family together with Feng Tianyu, walking out cautiously. Their faces beamed when they spotted Huang Xiaolong, and all of them knelt towards Huang Xiaolong in unison and pleaded, “Lord Benefactor, please take us away from here!”

“Yes ah, Lord Benefactor, please, lend us a helping hand and take us away from here too, we are willing to serve you, even as a coolie. Please, take us away!”

Several hundred slaves pleaded woefully.

Some of them even cried.

They did not want to be enslaved by the Chen Family anymore, refining pills day in day out until they died of exhaustion.

But if Huang Xiaolong was unwilling to take them away, they were absolutely certain that they wouldn’t make it out of the Central Holy Dynasty once they escaped on their own from the Chen Family. If they were caught back by the Chen Family, their lives would be more miserable.

Looking at several hundred slaves begging on their knees, Huang Xiaolong subconsciously frowned.

“Brother Tianyu, I beg you. Please help us persuade your friend, this Lord Benefactor, to save us. If we continue to stay here, we’re dead for certain. Brother Tianyu, for the sake of our time we’ve known each other, please, please, help us!” One of the slaves suddenly turned and begged Feng Tianyu.

During the time Feng Tianyu was enslaved, the two of them had gotten along quite well, and he had taken care of Feng Tianyu. This put Feng Tianyu in an awkward position.

Feng Tianyu knew very well that if Huang Xiaolong brought these Chen Family’s slaves with him, they would be a burden for Huang Xiaolong in the end. It was not nice to impose that on Huang Xiaolong.

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong agreed after pondering the matter for a while.

At the moment, his Myriad Dragon Peak was still considered deserted, there was only him and Zhang Wenyue. He needed to add some people, and it had been his plan all along to expand his own force at the Blue Sea. These Chen Family’s slaves would help with the expansion of his own force to a certain degree.

Most of these Chen Family’s slaves were half-step Venerables, and they were about the same strength as Feng Tianyu, close to advancing to Venerable Realm. As long as he had sufficient pills to support them, many of them could take that step and break through to the Venerable Realm.

After seeing Huang Xiaolong’s nod in agreement to take them away from the Chen Family, the five to six hundred slaves were overjoyed. They kowtowed nonstop to Huang Xiaolong in gratitude.

Huang Xiaolong subsequently selected two peak half-step Venerables as the head slaves of these several hundred Chen Family’s slaves. After that he temporarily placed them at a location while he made a trip to the Jiang Family with Feng Tianyu to pick up Feng Tianyu’s female disciple. When all were done, everyone would leave the Central Holy Dynasty together.

After Huang Xiaolong made the necessary arrangements for these Chen Family’s slaves, he distributed two origin pills for each person, one for healing their internal injuries, and the other to pill to raise their strengths and aid their cultivation advancement.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong headed to the Jiang Family with Feng Tianyu and the four guardians.

While Huang Xiaolong’s group of six headed in the direction of Jiang Family’s headquarters, the Jiang Family was filled with a festive atmosphere.

Bright and colorful lanterns lit up the entire Jiang Family’s headquarters, and voices of merrymaking could be heard on the streets.

These lanterns were crafted from one of the holy ground’s rarest gemstones, and the colorful threads were woven from top-grade grandmist silkworms.

Under the sunlight, these colorful lanterns emitted resplendent rays which were so mesmerizing yet soft that the entire Jiang Family headquarters resembled a huge colorful sun in the center of the Central Holy Dynasty.

And high in the air above the Jiang Family’s headquarters was a large floating word ‘longevity.’

This word ‘longevity’ was forged from many rare materials that were synonymous with long-life. Just this word ‘longevity’ was worth a hundred million holy bills.

This was a testament of the Jiang Family’s wealth.

Although there were still two days until the actual day of the Jiang Family forefather’s birthday banquet, various continents’, big dynasties’, and Venerable sects’ experts had been arriving consecutively since half a month ago. Twenty-four hours in a day, the streams of people that came to congratulate had never stopped.

There were times when even the wide entrance of Jiang Family’s headquarters felt narrow and crowded.

At this time, the Jiang Family’s main hall was fully seated with experts from various forces.

These experts who came to congratulate the Jiang Family were all Venerable experts from top sects and dynasties with certain level of identities. Those who were invited to sit inside the main hall, naturally had high statuses in the forces they came from. These sects and family forces were a power to be reckoned with, and each of them were people that could shake a dynasty or a continent with a stomp of their feet.

There were two people seated at the center of the hall, and one of them was none other than the Holy Gate’s chief disciple, Holy Prince Jiang Tian!

The other person had a head full of smooth silver hair. He had robust cheeks of good health on his beaming face. He was the Jiang Family’s old man, Jiang Wuji!

Jiang Wuji, the legendary existence of the holy ground.

According to the Holy Gate’s rules, apart from the Holy Gate’s Eminent Elders, everyone who saw a Holy Prince was required to salute on their knees, but there was another person who was exempted from this rule, and that was Jiang Wuji!

Jiang Wuji had made many meritorious contributions to the Holy Gate in the past, and the Holy Gate Patriarch Wan Zhuoyuan had made an exception and exempted Jiang Wuji from kneeling to a Holy Prince.

There were those that equate Jiang Wuji to the same status as the Holy Gate’s thirteen Eminent Elders.

Some rumors even claimed that even though Jiang Wuji was a peak half-True Saint, his strength was comparable to the Holy Gate’s Eminent Elders.

Either one of the rumors were proof of Jiang Wuji’s status in the holy ground.

In the first row after Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji’s table’s left side were the current Jiang Family’s Patriarch, the Revered River Divine Sect Chief, and Central Holy Dynasty’s Prince, as well as other representatives of Central Holy Dynasty’s top families. The Chen Family’s Patriarch Chen Kebin was also seated in the same first row. However, his place was slightly further to the back.

Though the Chen Family was also one of the Central Holy Dynasty’s top families, they were still lacking in the presence of forces like the Revered River Divine Sect. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Seats in the first row on the right side of Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji were taken by several young men clad in brocade dragon robes, with holy spiritual qi floating around them. There were several Holy Princes from the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground, and the first person in the first row was Tan Hongyi.

Although Tan Hongyi was not the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground’s chief disciple, his talent definitely ranked in the top three amongst the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground’s Holy Princes.
