Chapter 3636 – Let’s Meet Yu Xiaohong

They turned to the entrance of the main hall instantly.

They saw a massive group of people entering the hall without the slightest resistance! The protective formation around the hall didn’t seem to exist!

Yu Dawei looked at the beauty among the group.

“Ances… Ancestor…”

They couldn’t believe their eyes. Wasn’t she said to be trapped in the Bewilderment Island?! How did she escape?!

“What’s wrong? Are you disappointed that I managed to emerge from the Bewilderment Island?” Yu Xiaohong sneered when she saw the look on their faces.

“No… We’re just surprised that you managed to return!” Yu Dawei stuttered. “We’re extremely happy now that you’re back!”

Yu Bo stepped forward and got to his knees. “We congratulate lord ancestor on your safe return!”

Yu Xiaohong glanced at him casually before turning to look at the manual and pill in Yu Dawei’s hand.

“Are these the gifts from the Jian Family?” Yu Xiaohong snorted. “Jian Wushuang is really generous. In order to get you guys to surrender, he’s willing to bring out his sword manual…”

“Ancestor, you’re mistaken! Lord Jian Wushuang gave them to me as he admires my talent! He’s planning to give me some pointers. That’s all there is!” Yu Dawei explained hastily. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Oh? From what you’re saying, you don’t plan to surrender to the Jian Family.” Yu Xiaohong snorted.

Frowning, Yu Dawei gritted his teeth and he eventually spat, “That… That is true. You know what, I am already someone from the Jian Family! Yu Xiaohong, do you really think that you can do anything to me now that I’m part of them? Are you not afraid that Lord Jian Wushuang will deal with you? You might not know this since you just emerged from the Bewilderment Island, but Lord Jian Wushuang has already become the sixth supreme overlord in the Unknown Space!”

“He’s of the same status as Lord Zhu Chen!”

Yu Dawei roared haughtily. It was as though Jian Wushuang’s glory belonged to himself!

“Jian Wushuang? Sixth supreme overlord? That might not be the case…” Huang Xiaolong chuckled at the side.

Hearing a random youngster show his disrespect for Jian Wushuang, Yu Dawei snorted in anger, “Which rock did you crawl out from? Are you stupid? Get out of my sight, you fool!”

However, Yu Xiaohong sent him flying with a single slap as soon as he insulted Huang Xiaolong.

“Preposterous!”

Yu Xiaohong’s slap sent Yu Dawei flying into one of the walls in the hall.

She didn’t hold back much when slapping Yu Dawei. As such, blood streamed down his cheeks and there was a red palm print imprinted on his face.

Yu Bo who was still kneeling on the ground felt a wave of weakness in his legs.

When Yu Dawei finally crawled to his feet, he cleaned the blood off his cheeks and he sneered, “Old b*tch, is he a gigolo you found on your travels?! Are you crazy?! If you cripple me, Lord Jian Wushuang will fly into a rage! When that happens, you’ll be dead! This gigolo of yours will meet a miserable end!”

Killing intent filled her heart when she heard what he said. Glaring at Yu Dawei, she sneered, “Since that’s what you think, I’ll cripple you now!”

She circulated the grand cosmos energy in her body and a burst of golden light emerged from her palm as she slammed it into his chest.

Even though Yu Dawei was a half step Universe God, he hasn’t broken through the 10 billion mark! He was no match for her!

In an instant, his dao heart was shattered and his meridians broke into tiny little pieces.

Of course, she didn’t manage to shatter his physical body with a single strike. After all, the man was a half step Universe God and he was wearing a top-grade creation artifact level armor. His fleshy body was strong beyond belief. If the person who took the strike was an ordinary God of Creation at the grand completion level, they would have been turned into meat paste!

Yu Dawei stared at her in confusion as he didn’t believe that she had the guts to actually cripple him.

“Yu Xiaohong, why are you going so far for a mere gigolo?!” A sinister expression formed on his face and he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong. The sword in his hand moved quickly as it slashed towards Huang Xiaolong’s neck.

Huang Xiaolong might have been crippled by Yu Xiaohong’s strike, but he only experienced a massive drop in strength. He could still use whatever grand cosmos energy he accumulated in the past.

As they were pretty close to each other, Yu Dawei appeared before Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye. Ordinary God of Creation Realm experts at the large completion stage would never be able to hold off his attack.

However, Huang Xiaolong held the tip of Yu Dawei’s sword with his fingers.

Even though the tip of the sword was a mere inch away from Huang Xiaolong’s eye, it couldn’t budge any further.

Pinching his fingers together, Yu Dawei’s sword started to ring. Waving his hand, the sword in Yu Dawei’s hand turned into a streak of light that turned around to pierce through his forehead. With the sword sticking through his head, he was pinned to the wall on the far end of the hall.

“You can deal with him.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Yu Xiaohong.

“Yes, Lord.”

Yu Bo and Yu Dawei couldn’t believe what they just heard.

Soon after, Yu Xiaohong approached Yu Dawei.

When he felt the killing intent rolling off her, desperation filled his heart and he started to plead with her, “Mother, I was wrong! I… I… Please, spare me this time! I was forced by the Jian Family to do everything I did! If I refuse to submit, they’ll exterminate the celestial empire!

“Do you really think that I’m stupid? In order to break through the bottle neck of 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, you agreed to be Jian Wushuang’s slave! How dare you spin it another way?! In the past, I saved you out of the kindness of my heart! You were beaten half to death and I was the one who gave you all the resources you needed to reach your level today! Today, I’ll take back everything I gave you!” Yu Xiaohong sneered.

“Yu Xiaohong, if you dare to cripple me, Lord Jian Wushuang will never let you off!” Yu Dawei realized that there was no going back.

The moment the words left his lips, Yu Xiaohong waved her sword in the air and a million rays of sword light landed on Yu Dawei’s body.

A miserable shriek rang through the hall.

“Mercy!”

“Ancestor, please spare my father’s life!”

Yu Bo pleaded with her endlessly.

However, Yu Xiaohong turned her sword the other way and Yu Bo was no longer able to speak. He would remain silent till the end of time.

The very next day, Yu Xiaohong carried out a cleansing in her celestial empire.

In the inner hall of one of the manors in the city, Jian Xiyuan, an eminent elder of the Jian Family, frowned, “What?! Yu Xiaohong actually returned?!”

The news couldn’t be kept for long as Yu Xiaohong basically carried out a massacre in the celestial empire. The news of her return quickly reached the ears of those who were concerned.

“Yes… I heard that she crippled Yu Dawei the day she returned.” A grand elder of the Jian Family hesitated a moment before explaining.

Jian Xiyuan’s expression sank when he heard the news. He was the envoy from the Jian Family and he received an order from the patriarch of the Jian Family to negotiate the terms of alliance with the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. They were about to finalize the details, but who would have thought that Yu Xiaohong would return the day before it happened?!

In order to express their sincerity, they had already given Jian Wushuang’s sword manual and sword pill to Yu Dawei!

“Does she have our items?” Jian Xiyuan growled.

“Yes…”

“She knew that Yu Dawei was about to surrender to our Jian Family, but she went ahead and crippled him! She obviously doesn’t care about our Jian Family!” A cold light flashed through his eyes. “Alright. Let’s meet Yu Xiaohong and ask her what’s going on.”
