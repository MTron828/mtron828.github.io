Chapter 2521: Qualified to Stand on the Same Level as Dou Rui?

As everyone turned into a blood mist, a pretty rain drifted towards the ground below.

Zeng Yin and the others were shocked.

Sword qi moving based on one’s intent?! Killing several hundred Venerables in a single second?!

Could he be a half-True Saint?!

No… Is it possible that Huang Xiaolong has managed to bring so many half-True Saints over to work under him?

Huang Xiaolong had no idea about the thoughts that were running through their minds, and he asked, “Did you escape from the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As she snapped back to reality, tears rolled down Zeng Yin’s face as she spoke about the treatment they had received in the past few years. As the few ladies talked about their experiences, they gnashed their teeth, and it was clear they wanted nothing more than to tear Jiang Tian to pieces.

The expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face turned frosty when he heard about what they had been through.

“One of these days, I’ll kill Jiang Tian myself! I will carve his flesh off his body piece by piece, and feed him to the dogs!” Zeng Yin spat.

“There’s no need to wait for the day to come,” Huang Xiaolong spoke, “I’m going to kill Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji now.” As soon as he spoke, he brought Di Huai and the others towards the headquarters of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

Zeng Yin and the other ladies stared at him in shock.

Killing Jiang Tian right now?! Zeng Yin started to panic, and she quickly called him back. “Hold it right there! Junior Brother Huang, you can’t enter the holy gate! Jiang Tian has already thrown in his lot with the Devil Palace, and Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint experts from the Devil Palace are crawling all around the place! There’s even an expert at the First Heaven True Saint Realm holding the fort! You’ll be sending yourself to the gates of hell if you enter now!”

“You have to listen to me!”

Zeng Yin heavily emphasized the fact that there was a True Saint in the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate as she was afraid Huang Xiaolong would be unwilling to give up.

“Yeah! You don’t have to throw your life away just to prove a point! It’s never too late to take revenge! We should escape now and make plans for the future! One day, we’ll be able to kill Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji!” Liu Xinxin and the others tried to persuade Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and snorted softly.

He had long since learned about the presence of the True Saint in the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate. He also knew that there were two True Saints in total. He had investigated everything thoroughly before entering the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

Zeng Yin started to panic when she saw how nonchalant Huang Xiaolong was. “A First Heaven True Saint isn’t something your subordinates can take on! Even though they are half-True Saints, they are nothing in front of a True Saint! Junior Brother Huang, we should leave immediately! Jiang Tian will learn about our escape soon and more experts will be sent out to hunt us down!”

“That’s right! Your Highness, you can’t act impulsively!” Liu Xinxin continued.

A helpless smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he saw how adamant they were about running away.

“Little girl, calm down. His Highness knows his limits” The Departing Sword Sage could no longer hold back the sense of irritation in his heart, and he spoke to the ladies.

As soon as he spoke, a huge group of experts shot straight towards them. There were at least several tens of thousands of them in the group, and the aura they emitted was terrifying.

Zeng Yin and the other ladies revealed a look of fear when they saw the newcomers.

The people leading the group of experts were Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji!

Jiang Tian had already turned into the biggest devil in their hearts after their tens of years of imprisonment.

“Hahaha! Huang Xiaolong, there was a road to heaven, but you chose to barge through the gates of hell!” Jiang Tian roared with laughter and the mountain peaks around them started to shake.

Jiang Tian was ecstatic. He had never expected Huang Xiaolong to return to the Zhuoyuan Holy Grounds!

When Jiang Shilei was killed, tons of disciples had made a report to Jiang Tian. In the next moment, he had gathered all the experts under him to confront the enemy.

Huang Xiaolong snickered when he saw the look of joy on Jiang Tian’s face. “Why would I hide from you? I’ll come whenever I wish…”

“Pretty big words for a stupid little brat…” Jiang Tian chuckled. “Hehe, do you really think you can leave after entering the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate?” His gaze landed on Di Huai and a mocking smile appeared on his face. “Lord Di Huai, long time no see. You look good as always.”

Even though Zeng Yin and the other ladies had no idea who Di Huai was, Jiang Tian was extremely clear. However, he had no fear of Di Huai. After all, there were two late-First Heaven True Saints from the Devil Palace backing him up. Moreover, both of them had the ability to challenge early-Second Heaven True Saints.

As he had rushed over to confront Huang Xiaolong and the others, he had already notified both True Saints.

Di Huai was expressionless when he spoke to Jiang Tian, “Jiang Tian, you’re nothing but an ant in my eyes. If I wish to kill you, you’ll be dead. Who gave you the guts to talk to me? If you kneel down to beg for death, His Highness might allow you to die a more comfortable death.”

Everyone stared at him in shock.

It was especially so for those who didn’t know who Di Huai was. Anger rushed to their heads, and they hollered in rage.

“Preposterous!”

“How dare you speak to the young patriarch this way?! Why aren’t you kneeling in apology?!”

Several experts screamed at Di Huai instantly.

“You dare to call our young patriarch an ant?! Let’s see how much stronger you are!” Several family leaders, who had submitted to the Jiang Family, screamed at Di Huai. In the next instant, they charged at him with the intention to kill.

Even though they had only recently submitted to the Jiang Family, they were no weaklings. There were Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints among them, and there were even those at the peak of the mid-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

Jiang Tian had even hosted a banquet for them when they had agreed to serve under the Jiang Family.

After all, a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint was already an existence at the peak of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

After seeing these dumb*sses rushing towards him, Di Huai merely exhaled lightly. Those rushing towards him swelled up like a ball and popped like a balloon soon after.

Jiang Tian wanted to warn them of Di Huai’s cultivation realm, but he was a step too late.

When the other experts saw how their companions were killed with a single breath from Di Huai, they jumped in fright.

True Saint?!

That was the first thought that flashed through their minds.

There was only a single possibility! No half-True Saint could kill another half-True Saint with a single breath! Especially when the experts on their side were already at the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!

They took a step back in fear.

Zeng Yin and the others stared at Di Huai with a face full of shock.

Jiang Tian stared at Di Huai coldly and growled, “Di Huai, you went too far. Let me tell you right now. I’m working under Lord Dou Rui of the Devil Palace.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly when he heard how confident Jiang Tian was.

“Are you trying to tell us that you’re a big shot in the Holy World now that you’re working for Dou Rui?” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Do you really think that you’re qualified to stand on the same level as Di Huai?”

Even ordinary True Saints weren’t able to hold their heads up high in front of Jiang Tian. Of course, everything stemmed from Dou Rui’s power in the Devil Palace. It was too bad Jiang Tian had chosen the wrong True Saint to mess around with.

Devil qi surged through the space suddenly as a group of experts from the Devil Palace tore through the space.

A look of joy appeared on Jiang Tian’s face when he realized that the two True Saints from the Devil Palace had arrived.
