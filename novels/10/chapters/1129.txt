Ju Wufei’s lips curled into a sinister sneer, his gaze fixed on Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling as well as the Barbarian God Sect disciples on the ground below.

These disciples were like little lambs stripped off their protective shells.

All of a sudden, Ju Wufei attacked. His palms struck out, sending two giant palm imprints whizzing through the air. In the blink of an eye, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were hurled back without any power to resist.

Thunderous rumbles shook the air as Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s bodies smashed into the mountain peaks below.

"Ancestor!"

"Sect Chief!"

The Grand Elders, Elders, and disciples all shouted.

Several Grand Elders chased after their figures, rescuing them from the collapsed earth. Ju Wufei watched playfully without moving to stop them. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Lu Zhuo, Gu Ling, why are you being so stubborn when you already knew this is how things would end? Had you agreed to hand over Huang Xiaolong and let us into the Barbarian God Sect treasury, you wouldn’t have fallen to such a miserable state.”

Ju Wufei smiled coldly and went on, “I’m giving you one last chance! Have the Barbarian God Sect disciples submit to my Giant Tribe and give us Huang Xiaolong, then I’ll spare your lives!”

Out of everyone’s expectation, Lu Zhuo merely laughed hearing this. His disdainful gaze fell on Ju Wufei’s group, but he spoke no further.

Watching this, Ju Wufei snorted before he raised his index finger and pointed at Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling, sending the two of them flying back once again. On each of their chests was a large bloody hole that burned with dark green flames.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s faces were deathly pale, their bodies twitching from pain.

“This is my Green Flames Purgatory Finger. Whoever is struck by it will feel extreme pain as the fire poison rushes their heart, gnawing at their soul. It is said that even Hell’s Asuras cannot withstand this pain; let me see how long you two can last!” Ju Wufei said emotionlessly before turning to the group of Barbarian God Sect Grand Elders, “From now on, Chen Hao is the Barbarian God Sect’s Young Lord, you have ten minutes to consider. After ten minutes, those who are adamant to stand on Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s side, I’ll kill all of you!”

The group of Barbarian God Sect Grand Elders became ashen at Ju Wufei’s ultimatum.

The instant his voice fell, Cao Feng was the first to rush out to Chen Hao’s side and immediately whined, recounting in great detail how Huang Xiaolong humiliated her.

Chen Hao’s eyes turned scarlet listening to her, killing intent swirled out from his body like a raging tempest, “Don’t worry, I’ll have Huang Xiaolong kneel before you begging for his life. At that time, you can cut and slice him as you like!”

Cao Feng added, “I heard that Huang Xiaolong’s woman, Yao Chi, is still at South Huai City.”

A cold light glinted in Chen Hao’s eyes, his voice was just as cold, “Yao Chi? As I suspected, Grand Elder Cao Yang and the others were killed by Huang Xiaolong! In a few days, I’ll personally make a trip to South Huai City and capture that little wench Yao Chi. Hmph, I’ll strip her naked and hang her at the city gates so that every man in South Huai City can appreciate Huang Xiaolong’s woman.”

Cao Feng suggested, “That’s going easy on Yao Chi that slut. My grandfather and big brother were killed by Huang Xiaolong because of her, I think we can set up a martial competition stage; whoever wins three rounds and is willing to swear loyalty to you, they can have fun with her for one hour.”

Chen Hao’s eyes sparkled, laughing evilly, “This idea is not bad.” His gaze then swept over the Sky Dragon League members amongst the Barbarian God Sect disciples, he snapped, “I’m now the Barbarian God Sect’s Young Lord, why are you all not coming over here?!”

As Chen Hao was the one who created the Sky Dragon League, in the minds of the Sky Dragon League members, he was the highest authority. The instant he snapped, they immediately flew over by conditioned reflex, showing their loyalty.

Chen Hao’s gaze then fell on An Zaixuan, Qiu Bihu, and the other Grand Elders who were his supporters, saying, “An Zaixuan, Qiu Bihu, and all present Grand Elders, when I take over the position of Barbarian God Sect Chief, I won’t ill-treat you all.”

An Zaixuan and Qiu Bihu exchanged a glance, hesitating. A few minutes later, An Zaixuan flew up to Ju Wufei, swearing loyalty.

Watching this, Qiu Bihu and several other Grand Elders followed suit.

Ju Wufei inwardly nodded in appreciation; looks like Chen Hao had some degree of prestige in the sect, he didn’t accept this godson in vain. Otherwise, it would take him a lot more effort to take over the Barbarian God Sect.

The Elders and personal disciples brought up by An Zaixuan, Qiu Bihu, and others quickly followed, moving over to the Giant Tribe side.

In a short ten minutes, almost half of the Barbarian God Sect Grand Elders, Elders, core disciples, and inner disciples had gone over to the Giant Tribe’s side.

Ju Wufei sneered as his gaze swept over the Grand Elders, Elders, and disciples still on the opposite side. His palm reached out and grasped at the air, causing the bodies of several hundred Barbarian God Sect disciples to explode, painting the ground red with blood.

The rest of the disciples retreated in fear despite knowing it was of no use.

A burst of sonorous laughter rang in the air as Ju Wufei announced, “From now on, if you do not submit, I will kill five hundred disciples every five minutes!”

Kill five hundred disciples every five minutes!

Numerous disciples became ashen due to fear. Immediately, another group of disciples went over to the Giant Tribe side.

Watching this, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were furious, yet helpless.

“Lu Zhuo, Gu Ling, how do you feel now? More than half of your Barbarian God Sect disciples have chosen to submit to me.” Ju Wufei snickered, “How’s the taste of being abandoned?”

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling glared daggers at Ju Wufei.

As more and more Barbarian God Sect disciples went over to the Giant Tribe side, the Great Whale Sect and Elephant Genesis Sect received the Barbarian God Sect’s request for reinforcements.

Both sects’ Ancestors, Zhu Huan and Ren Changhai were discussing the sea tribes’ attacks against the Green Cloud Island when they received a report about the Giant Tribe attacking the Barbarian God Sect, shocking them.

Although the three sects were always competing with each other, they had always stood united when their survival was in question.

However, the other party was the Giant Tribe, which made Zhu Huan and Ren Changhai hesitate. They both knew the Giant Tribe’s strength, as well as Ju Wufei’s power; even with the three sects banding together, their situation was akin to hitting a stone with an egg. The Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect would most likely be dragged down too.

The Great Whale Sect’s Ancestor Zhu Huan spoke solemnly, “In truth, it’s a good thing if the Giant Tribe annihilates the Barbarian God Sect. Once their sect is annihilated, we can seize the chance to divide their territories, not to mention that Huang Xiaolong’s talent is too monstrous. If he grows up, he’ll be too big a threat to us, we won’t have to worry about this anymore if he dies.”

The Elephant Genesis Sect Ancestor Ren Changhai frowned, “The problem is, after the Giant Tribe annihilates the Barbarian God Sect, will they point their sword at us next?”

Zhu Huan laughed, “The Giant Tribe may have such an appetite but not the stomach, I’ve quite a good relationship with the Perennial Temple’s Ancestor.”

Hearing this, Ren Changhai’s face brightened. This was the Perennial Island’s biggest super force, and although it wasn’t on par with the Giant Tribe, the gap was negligible. If the Perennial Temple’s Ancestor came forward, they naturally need not fear the Giant Tribe.

Ren Changhai could finally laugh with ease, “Lu Zhuo thought he picked up a treasure because of Huang Xiaolong’s monstrous talent but this disciple has brought a calamity onto the Barbarian God Sect instead. Lu Zhuo ah, Lu Zhuo, you didn’t imagine there would be such a day!”

Zhu Huan was grinning from ear to ear, “We should have our disciples prepare. Once the Barbarian God Sect is annihilated, we must quickly seize their territories!”
