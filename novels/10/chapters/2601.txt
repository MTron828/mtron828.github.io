Chapter 2602: Big Brother, You’re Here!

Even though the number of True Saints wasn’t in the hundreds, there were at least twenty of them standing in line.

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong entered the queue, Chen Muguang brought the members of the Chen Luo Sect and entered the plaza.

Since there weren’t too many True Saints lining up to register, they soon caught sight of Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s him! He’s actually a True Saint!” The expert, who had proposed saving Huang Xiaolong, gasped in shock. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Even though the expert was a First Heaven True Saint, he failed to see through Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation base.&nbsp;

Those around him couldn’t believe it either.

Chen Muguang’s expression fell, and he snorted coldly, “No wonder he’s so arrogant. Even if he’s a True Saint, he won’t be able to get away with it! The Otherworldly Mansion’s enforcement hall will definitely capture him soon!”

“Since he’s able to cultivate to become a True Saint, his talent wouldn’t be weak. He might even pass the test to enter the Otherworldly Mansion!” Someone else muttered, “As soon as he becomes a disciple of the Otherworldly Mansion, those from the Seven Souls Race wouldn’t be able to touch him! Neither would those from the enforcement hall!”

Normally, eight out of ten True Saints would pass the test to enter the mansion. After all, those who could destroy the shackles of the half-True Saint Realm to enter the True Saint Realm were extremely talented individuals.&nbsp;

Chen Muguang’s expression sank once again.

He didn’t know why, but he was extremely irritated when he saw Huang Xiaolong even though they were both humans.

All of a sudden, ripples swept through the plaza as a group of disciples wearing the same uniform entered.

They came from the enforcement hall of the Otherworldly Mansion!

A look of joy flashed in Chen Muguang’s eyes.

He was right! Those from the enforcement hall were here to capture that human!

“Young Master, that’s Hun Rui from the Seven Souls Race!” Chen Chenfeng, an expert of the Chen Luo Sect, pointed at someone in the crowd and introduced. Everyone looked in the direction he was pointing in, and they saw a middle-aged man leading a group of experts of the Seven Souls Race over. Who else could he be other than Hun Rui?!

Chen Muguang snickered under his breath when he noticed them. “Hehe, they’re right on time! The brat can’t escape his fate no matter how hard he tries!”&nbsp;

Very quickly, they arrived before Huang Xiaolong. Forming a tight encirclement around him, a huge area was cleared out from the plaza.

“Who is this kid? Why are Hun Rui and Lord Wu Ming from the enforcement hall looking for him?” several experts in the distance asked in shock.

“I’ve heard that Hun Rui’s disciple was killed by a human, several moments ago. I thought it was a mistake, but it seems like the news is real! How dare that human kill Hun Rui’s disciple?”

A sinister smile appeared on Hun Rui’s face when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “A mere Second Heaven True Saint?! Hehe, I haven’t tortured a human True Saint in a long time!”

He cupped his fist and turned to Wu Ming from the enforcement hall. “Lord Wu Ming, why don’t you hand this human over to us?”

Wu Ming chuckled softly, “I don’t see why not!” After all, it would be great if he could make Hun Rui of the Seven Souls Race owe him a favor.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the two of them with an expressionless face. With his identity as the Purple Spider Race’s young patriarch, he could kill Hui Rui and the Otherworldly Mansion wouldn’t be able to hold him accountable.

Even though the Purple Spider Race had already fallen from their peak, they were still an alien race royal family! It might not be fine for a member of the Alien Race to kill a human, but the situation wasn’t the same if a young patriarch of a royal family killed the disciples of the Seven Souls Race.

The moment Hun Rui turned around and tried to grab Huang Xiaolong, a lazy voice rang through the skies. “Hold it right there.”

Even though it sounded a little too casual, the weight the voice carried made it so that no one could question the speaker’s authority.

Turning to the source of the voice, Hun Rui’s face sank. How dare someone interfere with the matters of his Seven Souls Race?!

However, when he turned to face the person who spoke, the rage in his heart evaporated instantly.

Chen Muguang and the others were equally as shocked.

As for Wu Ming of the enforcement hall, he rushed over with a brilliant smile on his face. “Vice Hall Master Jiang Shaohuang!”

The person who came was precisely the young patriarch of the Suoluo Race, Jiang Shaohuang!

He wasn’t just the &nbsp;patriarch of the Suo Luo Race. In fact, he was also the vice hall master of the enforcement hall in the Otherworldly Mansion! In order to kiss up to Jiang Shaohuang, Wu Ming didn’t hesitate to address him differently.

After Wu Ming gave his greetings, those from the Seven Souls Race followed up, “We greet Lord Jiang!” After a short hesitation, Hun Rui asked, “Does Lord Jiang know this human? Is he the slave of one of your subordinates?”

As soon as he completed his sentence, Jiang Shaohuang sent him flying with a slap. “Pa!” A handprint formed on Hun Rui’s face.

Everyone stared at the scene before them in shock.

Even Wu Ming couldn’t help but yelp as he tried thinking of how Hun Rui had offended the vice hall master.

As for the person who was slapped, he didn’t know what he had done wrong either.

“You must be blind!” Jiang Shaohuang roared, “This person is my sworn brother!”

“Huh?!”&nbsp;

Those present in the plaza felt the world spinning around them.

“Sworn brother?!” Hui Rui stared at Jiang Shaohuang stupidly.

The Suoluo Race is a royal race! As the young patriarch of the Suo Luo Race, Jiang Shaohuang actually became a sworn brother with a human?!

When did humans become so noble?!

Chen Muguang’s reaction was the largest out of everyone there.

“This…!” A weird feeling appeared in his heart.

When everyone was still trying to recover from their shock, Jiang Shaohuang walked up to Huang Xiaolong as a smile slowly formed on his face. “Big Brother, you’re finally here!”

Big Brother?! Finally here?!

No one dared to believe what they had just heard.

Is this the Jiang Shaohuang we know?!

However, Huang Xiaolong merely nodded his head slowly. A snort left his lips when he spoke about his experience, “It’s good that you’re here. Your men from the enforcement hall wanted to capture me without stating what laws I broke.”

Jiang Shaohuang ‘glared’ at Wu Ming and started his interrogation, “Wu Ming, is that true? Were you going to capture him without any evidence?! What did he do wrong?!”

Wu Ming was terrified, but he soon noticed the look in Jiang Shaohuang’s eyes. “I… I… I was misled by the members of the Seven Souls Race! It’s all a misunderstanding!”

Even though he didn’t know what was wrong with Jiang Shaohuang to take a human as his sworn brother, he knew what he had to do. Right now, the most important thing was to draw a clear line between him and the members of the Seven Souls Race.

As for Hun Rui, his expression changed when he heard what Wu Ming said. Rushing over to Jiang Shaohuang, he wanted to explain himself, but he was sent flying with a single kick from the man.

When Wu Ming saw how Hun Rui was mercilessly kicked away, he felt beads of cold sweat dripping down his forehead.
