The powerful destructive force of the Golden Horned Beast King’s self-destruction rushed over his own subordinates and the Azure Dragon Institute Grand Elders, shattering them into pieces and leaving only a patch red blood mist.

Jia Xiangtian was flipped high into the air, then tumbled and rolled on the ground in the far distance. When he finally stopped, his body was covered with blood and dirt, the white of his bones could be seen here and there. Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s strike earlier had left him with barely half a life, adding the destructive explosion force from the Golden Horned Beast King, Jia Xiangtian was now a lifeless broken corpse.

However, a Highgod Realm master didn’t truly die if their godhead was unbroken and their soul intact, therefore Jia Xiantian was still alive.

A long time later, the destructive force from the Golden Horned Beast King’s self-destruction weakened and gradually dispersed.

After the dust storm subsided, the surroundings were calm and quiet. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The surrounding ground was now a few meters lower than it originally was, and the spot where the Golden Horned Beast King blew up became a giant pit several hundred meters deep, dark and seemingly bottomless.

It was fortunate that Huang Xiaolong secured the surrounding space prior with the God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope, negating more than half of the destructive force from the explosion. On top of that, Huang Xiaolong had previously strengthened the Huang Clan Manor’s grand defensive formation, hence, the Huang Clan Manor avoided any damages. Otherwise, the Huang Clan Manor would have probably been razed to the ground, leaving nothing but pieces of ruins.

However, the city some hundreds of miles away was affected by the shockwaves. The entire city walls collapsed and the buildings inside crumbled into dust. Not a single survivor could be found inside the city.

Huang Xiaolong’s face sank looking at this. It didn’t occur to him in the slightest that the Golden Horned Beast King would choose to self-destruct.

“Something’s peculiar about this matter.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi spoke in a gloomy voice.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

The Golden Horned Beast King didn’t need to self-destruct, his actions were more like a death guard.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes fell on the unconscious Jia Xiangtian’s body. A suction force from his palm pulled Jia Xiangtian’s body right in front of him.

A purple light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes and a purple-colored symbol flew out from his pupils, entering Jia Xiangtian’s forehead to scour his soul. A short while later, the soul-scouring ended, but Huang Xiaolong’s expression was gloomier than before.

Great Lord?!

The Golden Horned Beast King and Jia Xiangtian both actually took orders from this young man referred to as ‘Great Lord’, coming here to kill him?

And from Jia Xiangtian’s memories, even their Black Warrior Institute Vice Principal, that old witch Wang Na, the Jiang Family Patriarch Jiang Wuhuang, the Gudu Family Ancestor and Patriarch, all took orders from this young man they called Great Lord.

In the four galaxies, the number of Highgod Realm masters that submitted themselves to this Great Lord exceeded thirty!

However, Jia Xiangtian didn’t know in detail which super force they belonged to.

“What is it?” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi asked seeing Huang Xiaolong’s expression.

Huang Xiaolong told Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi what he discovered after the soul-scouring, and even the old dragon was astonished at the information. In the four galaxies, there were more than thirty Highgod Realm masters that were under the command of this young man they called Great Lord?!

That was a frightening thought.

This was equivalent to having control of over thirty super forces.

The reason why Huang Xiaolong was able to control the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, and the rest was because he practiced the Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate, which enabled him to brand others’ soul.

Did that mean that the mysterious Great Lord cultivated similar techniques, being able to manipulate others through their soul?

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi asked this question to Huang Xiaolong, but he could only shake his head, having no answer himself.

However, judging from the Golden Horned Beast Kings’ action, this mysterious Great Lord was most likely skilled in soul control and manipulation as well.

“This shadowy Great Lord, what is he planning by controlling so many Highgod Realm masters?” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s expression grew somber, “Does he want to control the four galaxies?”

Huang Xiaolong too was looking solemn, “I’m afraid so. From Jia Xiangtian’s memories, this mysterious Great Lord will act against my Master during the God Ranking List Battle, to kill him. When that happens, that old witch Wang Na would take over the Black Warrior Institute Principal position, and with my Master dead in the God Ranking Battle, Wang Na will fully control the whole Black Warrior Institute.”

If Huang Xiaolong’s Master Feng Yang remained unharmed, even if Wang Na managed to sit on the Institute Principal position, Feng Yang’s presence would hinder her from completely grasping the entire Black Warrior Institute in her palms.

But if Feng Yang died, it was a different situation altogether.

“Since Jia Xiangtian has submitted to that so-called Great Lord, what about the Azure Dragon Institute Principal Qin Yi? Did he also submit?” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi spoke of the grave matter he had thought of. If Qin Yi had also submitted to this Great Lord, the matter was graver than they had assumed.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No, Qin Yi did not; but other than Jia Xiangtian, in the Azure Dragon Institute, there is another Grand Elder named Wu Yun that has submitted.”

Hearing this, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was slightly relieved.

As long as Qin Yi wasn’t in that group, the situation wasn’t that bad.

The Azure Dragon Institute had over a third of the Azure Dragon Galaxy’s prominent families and forces align themselves with the institute. In other words, Qin Yi as its Institute Principal controlled a third of the Azure Dragon Galaxy’s forces.

Imagine, how shocking would the combined power of hundreds, thousands of prominent families forces be?

“Then how do you want to handle this Jia Xiangtian?” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi asked.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the still unconscious Jia Xiangtian, murder flickered in his eyes, “Since the Golden Horned Beast King is dead, I’ll send Jia Xiangtian down to accompany him.” A bright light flashed as a snow-white icy fire hovered above his finger.

This Jia Xiangtian was already under the mysterious Great Lord’s control, thus it was not possible for Huang Xiaolong to wrestle over the ‘control rights’. The only choice left was to erased Jia Xiangtian.

With a flick, the Black Tortoise Divine Fire had engulfed Jia Xiangtian’s soul and godhead.

At this point, Jia Xiangtian woke up, screaming in pain.

Yet, very soon, his screamed weakened and disappeared, his body no longer twisted around, his eyes blank and lifeless.

After confirming that the Black Tortoise Divine Fire completely incinerated Jia Xiangtian’s soul, Huang Xiaolong retrieved it back into his body. Slightly bending his fingers, the suction force sucked Jia Xiangtian’s godhead into Huang Xiaolong’s palm.

“Rank four?” Scrutinizing Jia Xiangtian’s godhead, Huang Xiaolong was disappointed.

“Do you think anyone can condense a rank five or six godhead ah?” Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi teased.

Huang Xiaolong smiled sheepishly, “Hehe, that’s true.”

Though Jia Xiangtian’s godhead was only a rank four, moreover, it was only a mid-First Order Highgod Realm, the godforce and God’s Law contained inside was sufficient to improve his cultivation by a small step.

Putting away the godhead into his Asura Ring, he ordered the demonic beasts to clean up the surrounding mess, whereas he, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, and the rest returned to the Huang Clan Manor.

Back in Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong decided to first refine Jia Xiangtian’s godhead and then head out to search for the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s other sealed body parts. Before today, Huang Xiaolong had thought that he wasn’t weak, but this mysterious Great Lord’s emergence gave Huang Xiaolong great pressure.

He had to work harder, strive to breakthrough to Highgod Realm!

Huang Xiaolong issued some instructions and entered seclusion the next day to refine Jia Xiangtian’s rank four godhead.
