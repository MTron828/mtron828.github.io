As soon as the words left Sun Shihai’s lips, the entire hall fell into silence.

He was simply provoking Huang Xiaolong in his face!

The gaze of the surrounding disciples landed on Huang Xiaolong as they wondered how he would react to this open insult.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Sun Shihai’s arrogant expression, and said with indifference, “I’m not interested.”

Not interested!

As though a bomb exploded in their mind, all the disciples around them stared blankly at Huang Xiaolong.

Without skipping a beat, Huang Xiaolong started to walk out of the hall.

Sun Shihai wasn’t able to control his anger from being dismissed and taunted, “Huang Xiaolong, why are you in such a hurry to leave? Are you afraid to see the results of my test? Are you too much of a scardy-cat to find out that I have a higher cultivation and combat power than you? Are you too cowardly to face the facts?”

Huang Xiaolong frowned and stopped.

At this moment, the hall master of the Snow Moon Hall, Yan Ying, smiled, “Little brother Xiaolong, even if you want to rush back and cultivate, surely you have some time to spare, right? Since we’re already here, why not stay for a little longer to look at my junior brother’s test result? Isn’t there a saying that goes, ‘know yourself, know your enemy’? Anyway, you have nothing to lose by taking a look...”

Looking at the smile on Yan Ying’s face, an urge to slap her till her face swelled like a pig’s head appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

“Is big sister Ying free later?” Huang Xiaolong said as a brilliant smile appeared on his face.

Everybody present felt their jaw drop when they heard how he addressed her.

Big sister?

When they thought about how Yan Ying addressed Huang Xiaolong as ‘little brother Huang’, they felt that it was reasonable for him to do the same.

“Little brother Xiaolong, is there anything you need?” Yan Ying smiled.

Huang Xiaolong stared directly at her chest and smirked, “If you are free later, you can come visit my Dragon Tiger Palace.”

Visit my Dragon Tiger Palace!

When they heard his suggestive tone, everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a strange gaze. Despite her charm, everyone knew of her ‘secret’ relationship with Elder Zhou Chen and none of them dared to approach her. On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong dared to tease her in public!

Was he trying to turn Elder Zhou Chen into a cuckold?

Even Sun Shihai’s face turned unsightly.

Yan Ying’s face twitched even though she knew that Huang Xiaolong had done it intentionally. Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s handsome face, a weird feeling appeared in her heart.

“Many thanks for the invitation to your Dragon Tiger Palace, however, I still need to make a trip to look for my master.” Yan Ying smilingly said.

“In that case, it’s a real pity. I was originally planning on discussing some of the ancient secret arts I obtained in the Floating Twilight Land with you.”

A strange expression appeared on the faces of the disciples surrounding them.

Ancient secret art?!

Was he referring to the Yin Yang Dual Cultivation?!

Some of the disciples looked at Huang Xiaolong with a sense of admiration. They felt that out of everyone in the Fortune Emperor Palace, he was the only fearless soul who dared to tease the hall master of the Snow Moon Hall. If any other disciple tried to follow in Huang Xiaolong’s footsteps, their skin would be peeled off by Elder Zhou Chen for sure. It didn’t matter if they had one or a hundred layers of skin, Elder Zhou Chen would definitely peel it off one by one

Yan Ying’s face flushed red from embarrassment and any sane man would be tempted by her charm. Instead of replying to Huang Xiaolong, she merely smiled.

“Elder Bai, please start the test.” Sun Shihai broke the awkward atmosphere in the hall.

In the next second, everyone fixed their gazes on Sun Shihai.

Seeing that the test was about to start, Huang Xiaolong decided to stay. He didn’t want people to think that he was afraid of Sun Shihai and was running away like a cowardly turtle.

Like Huang Xiaolong, Sun Shihai took the bone age test. However, that was the end of the similarity. His bones were over ten thousand years old but no one felt that anything was wrong. After all, everyone knew about his test result when he joined the Fortune Emperor palace.

Next came the test of combat power.

Sun Shihai raised his hand with a swift motion and poured his godforce into the jade mirror stone. The stone exploded with intense rays of light and after it started to dim, everyone caught sight of the blood red glow surrounding it.

When the glow started to die down, a row of words appeared on the surface of the stone. “Realm, peak of the late-Fifth Order God King Realm, Combat power, late-Sixth Order God King Realm!”

Everyone stared at the stone in shock as though they couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Oh my god! Senior Brother Shihai broke through to the peak late-Fifth Order God King Realm! His cultivation speed is too terrifying!”

“Back when Senior Brother Shihai entered the Fortune Emperor Palace, wasn’t he only at the early-Second Order God King Realm? In a mere span of ten years, he managed to reach the peak of late-Fifth Order God King Realm! His cultivation speed is simply too shocking!”

“Martial Uncle Shihai is worthy of his title as a supreme genius! With his combat strength, he will definitely be able to pass through the upcoming selections!”

Their fervent discussion exceeded the scope of that when Huang Xiaolong’s results were announced.

When the praises flooded into his ears, a contented expression appeared on Sun Shihai’s face. He folded his hands before him and smiled at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, I haven’t had the chance to exchange pointers with you. I hope that we will meet each other during the selections.”

An indifferent expression hung on Huang Xiaolong’s face, “We most definitely will.”

Sun Shihai smirked, “From what I see, your strength is too lacking. You don’t have to worry. If we really meet during the selections, I will only use half of my strength.”

Half of his strength?

Huang Xiaolong sneered in his heart. When the time comes, let’s see if you can still maintain the smile on your face.

Ignoring Sun Shihai, Huang Xiaolong turned around and left.

This time, Sun Shihai did not bother stopping Huang Xiaolong.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong left, both Sun Shihai and Yan Ying started making their way towards Zhou Chen’s cultivation palace.

Once the two of them reached Zhou Chen’s cultivation palace, he had long received the news about how Huang Xiaolong had teased Yan Ying in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

When Zhou Chen heard the news, he couldn’t believe his ears. His body started to tremble and rage filled his entire being. His killing intent soared and qi shot out like knives from his body, destroying everything in the hall.

Cracks in space started appearing around him.

“Huang, Xiao, Long!!! Do you really think I won’t be able to kill you because Fang Gan and Zhao Lei are supporting you?!” Zhou Chen gnashed his teeth in anger.

Everybody had their reverse scale, and his was Yan Ying!

A moment later, Sun Shihai and Yan Ying arrived and were startled at the state the hall was in.

“Master.” The two of them walked forward and greeted him.

After greeting the both of them, Zhou Chen spoke to Sun Shihai, “Haven’t you always been wanting to spar with Huang Xiaolong? I will definitely give you a chance to do so in the selections.”

Sun Shihai was overjoyed at the chance. “Thank you master.”

Zhou Chen warned, “There is only one thing you have to do. Show no mercy and destroy him with all you got! Do you understand?!”

“Master, please rest assured, I will definitely make him suffer! He will no longer be the mighty disciple he once was!” Sun Shihai swore resolutely.

Zhou Chen nodded his head in satisfaction and continued, “Alright, you can head back. I have some important matters to discuss with your senior sister.”

Important matters he needed to discuss with her?!

Sun Shihai bowed respectfully and left.
