Chapter 3265: Kill An Enlightenment Realm Expert?

“Yes, there are people watching us, and it’s people from Huang Family’s Enforcement Hall,” Huang Xiaolong confirmed. How could these Enforcement Hall’s disciples watching them escape Huang Xiaolong’s notice, he was merely too lazy to deal with them.

“What? The Huang Family’s Enforcement Hall is watching us? Why?” Huang Jiyuan’s face ashened as he blurted out in bewilderment.

Wang Meilan, Huang Chenfei, and Huang Datou felt extremely flustered when they heard it was the Huang Family’s Enforcement Hall who was keeping an eye on them.

“Because I broke Huang Bo’s arms and legs, and dug out his eyes last night,” Huang Xiaolong explained nonchalantly. “I also broke Huang Baogui’s spine, he’ll be spending the rest of his life bedridden.”

Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, Huang Chenfei, and Huang Datou looked like they saw a ghost after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words.

“Xiaolong, you were too rash!!” Huang Jiyuan almost yelled, “Huang Baogui is Huang Houde’s nephew, and Huang Bo is his grandson, so your actions will only draw ire from the Huang Family, you’re really too reckless!”

Huang Jiyuan was clearly agitated.

In his opinion, Huang Xiaolong’s actions were no less than capital crime in the family. Although he had seen many incredulous things today, and understood that his son was not as simple as he thought, the person Huang Xiaolong had offended now was Huang Houde. Offending Huang Houde meant offending the entire Huang Family!

Huang Xiaolong was only one person. Could he go against the entire Huang Family?!

“What should we do now? Go and beg Huang Baogui for forgiveness? We have low-grade spirit stones now. Yes, that’s it. We have low-grade spirit stones. We can give them a lot, a lot of spirit stones!” Wang Meilan said anxiously.

Huang Xiaolong felt speechless, but he understood that his parents were concerned and worried for him.

“Mom, even if you take out all the spirit stones you have and give it to Huang Houde, he would not let this matter slide.” Huang Xiaolong stated calmly, “In fact, all of you don’t need to worry about me, it’s merely the Huang Family. Frankly speaking, if I wanted to, destroying the Huang Family is merely the matter of waving my hand.”

Indeed, had Huang Xiaolong wanted to destroy the Huang Family, it would take no more than the effort of waving his hand, despite having his strength suppressed to the lowest realm, at the peak late-Ninth Level Void Immortal. With one wave of his hand, he could flatten the Huang Family’s main residence to the ground.

However, for every grievance, there’s a main perpetrator, and a debtor for every debt. In this case, Huang Xiaolong’s enemy was Huang Houde. The rest of Huang Family disciples were mostly innocent, and slaughtering the innocent was not in Huang Xiaolong’s plan.

He was waiting, waiting for Huang Houde to come back, and then he would deal with Huang Houde and his line of descendants once and for all.

Wang Meilan blanked for a second when she heard Huang Xiaolong claim that destroying the Huang Family was merely the matter of waving a hand, and then chided Huang Xiaolong half-seriously, “This child’s joking again.”

Huang Jiyaun agreed without hesitation. “Xiaolong, you’ve just returned for a few days, so you don’t know the Huang Family’s current strength. The current Huang Family is one of Huaxiao’s top ten cultivation families, and the family’s overall strength is not something you can imagine.”

“Strength?” Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly, and asked both Wang Meilan and Huang Jiyuan, “What if I’m capable of killing an Enlightenment Realm expert?”

Wang Meilan wanted to say more, but her mind went blank at Huang Xiaolong’s question. So did Huang Jiyuan’s, Huang Chenfei’s, and Huang Datou’s. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Ca-capable of-of killing an Enlightenment Realm expert?!” Wang Meilan scrutinized Hunag Xiaolong with a strange eye when she finally found her voice, her gaze clearly said ‘how’s that possible!

The other three also looked at Huang Xiaolong with the same meaning.

In their knowledge, the Enlightenment Realm experts were top experts on Earth. A Nascent Soul Realm expert could live for five hundred years, and some of the Transcendent experts that came from outer space were old monsters that had lived over a thousand years.

A thousand years!

That kind old monsters could flatten a mountain with a wave of their hands, and the power within them could destroy the world. Perhaps, even nuclear bombs were useless against a high-level Transcendent expert. A high-level Transcendent expert was an existence even the Huaxia Alliance was wary of. In the last one hundred years, since Earth had ushered in the cultivation era, they had never heard of any Transcendent expert being killed.

Now, Huang Xiaolong was telling them he could kill a Transcendent expert?! It was no wonder that the four of them were looking at Huang Xiaolong with a strange gaze.

“Xiaolong, you, are you alright?” Wang Meilan cautiously tried to touch Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly. “Mom, I am fine.” Then, he reached his hand towards the sky and grabbed a passing cloud, letting it suspend above the villa.

Huang Jiyuan, and Wang Meilan stared at the cloud that suddenly descended to the villa. Huang Xiaolong can control the clouds?

“Can a Transcendent expert control the clouds?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The other four exchanged a glance but remained silent.

“Brother, we’ve never seen a Transcendent expert in action, so we don’t know if a Transcendent expert can control clouds or not,” Huang Chenfei answered honestly.

This time, it was Huang Xiaolong who was dumbfounded.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong resorted to taking his family on a flight. He teleported from Huazhou City to Datong City, then from Datong City he teleported everyone to Laixin City, and finally back to the Golden River Residence villa.

“That is teleportation, almost instantly moving from one city to another city. Can a Transcendent expert teleport?” Huang Xiaolong asked the four stupefied people.

But in the end, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, Huang Chenfei, and Huang Datou’s reaction was to shake their heads and say they didn’t know. That was the truth because none of them had any contact with Transcendent experts. Moreover, discussing Transcendent experts was a taboo. Even the upper echelons of Huang Family did not dare to lightly discuss Transcendent experts, thus it was not strange the few of them knew very little about what Transcendent experts could do or could not do.

In their scope of knowledge, they only knew that the Enlightenment Realm experts were very strong, and almost nothing was impossible to them, and they couldn’t be killed.

Huang Xiaolong’s brows were scrunched together, and his head was aching. How can I make my parents and the others believe my current strength?

Suddenly, an idea came to him. His divine sense spread out and locked on the Huang Family’s six grand elders inside the main residence’s hall in Datong City. If I drag these six people over, my parents and the others should believe me, right?

There were more than ten Nascent Soul experts within the Huang Family’s ranks, but only the six of them were at the Huang Family’s main residence at the moment.

These Huang Family’s grand elders were talking about Huang Xiaolong and the incident he had caused.

“According to me, we don’t need to wait for the Patriarch to return. I’ll go and capture Huang Xiaolong and end the matter,`` Huang Chengyi snorted.

Huang Chengyi was Huang Houde’s eldest uncle, also the third strongest expert in Huang Family, a peak late-Seventh Level Nascent Soul with one foot in Eighth Level Nascent Soul Realm.

“With Huang Xiaolong’s talent that we know of, he’s probably already a Seventh Level Nascent Soul now, so it won’t be easy to capture him,” another grand elder, Huang Bingquan pointed out, “Moreover, the Patriarch has ordered that he wants to deal with Huang Xiaolong personally, so, we’d better wait for the Patriarch to return. We only need to watch Huang Xiaolong, make sure he doesn’t make a run for it!”

Huang Bingquan was not of Huang Houde’s line, but his status in Huang Family was not low as he was Old Ancestor Huang Ming’s second son. In terms of seniority, he was Huang Jiyuan’s second uncle.

“However, according to the report from the disciples, there’s something strange. Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan seem to have grown younger, looking like they’re in their forties, moving with ease. On top of that, Huang Chenfei’s injuries have fully healed, and he’s off the bed, moving around freely,” another grand elder, Huang Maosheng, informed everyone with surprise on his face.
