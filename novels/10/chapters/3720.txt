Chapter 3721: Black Source Ice

The White Deer stared at Huang Xiaolong as confusion flashed through its eyes. It didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would possess so many treasures.

“That’s still far from enough to trade for information on the Universe Source Stone.”

Huang Xiaolong brought out another White Sun Phoenix Flame Spiritual Vein.

Yang Dingsheng felt his legs going soft.

“Another one?!”

Huang Xiaolong not only possessed two Radiant Spiritual Veins of Life. He also had two strands of White Sun Phoenix Flame Spiritual Veins! How in the world did he obtain so many of them?!

Yang Dingsheng wouldn’t dare to think that Huang Xiaolong managed to grab them all by robbing the Universe First Race.

If he learned about it, he might question his whole existence.

“Nope.” The White Deer sighed.

Huang Xiaolong took out two other spiritual veins.

This time, it was the Angelic Light Spiritual Vein.

“Angelic Light Spiritual Vein?!” Yang Dingsheng yelled.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Of course, it was of a similar rarity as the two spiritual veins before.

“Not enough!”

“Nine Sun Dragon Zoysia Spiritual Vein!”

“Not enough!”

…

“Heavenly Genesis Spiritual Vein!”

After Huang Xiaolong brought out more than eight spiritual veins at the same level as that of the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life, everyone stared at him in shock.

The White Deer looked at Huang Xiaolong silently. It was obvious that it was tempted by Huang Xiaolong’s offer.

After all, those were no ordinary universe-level spiritual veins!

“How did you manage to obtain so many top-grade spiritual veins?” The White Deer asked.

“You don’t need to worry about that,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Saving someone is nothing but a slight inconvenience to you. I only wish to learn of the location of the Universe Source Stone. I’m not asking you to give it to me. It won’t be easy for me to obtain it either.”

Weird light flashed in the White Deer’s eyes. It was true. Obtaining the Universe Source Stone wasn’t easy! After all, it knew where the stone was. Even after all these years, it failed to obtain it.

As such, the Universe Source Stone was nothing more than decoration to the White Deer.

“Alright. I agree.”

Yang Dingsheng jumped with joy when he heard what it said. Turning to Huang Xiaolong, tears of gratitude streamed down his face. “Thank you. Thank you, Brother Huang!”

The White Deer rolled its eyes when it saw Yang Dingsheng’s reaction. “Brat, why aren’t you thanking me? Don’t forget, I’m the one doing the saving. From the looks of it, you probably wish to save someone close to you, right?”

Turning to the White Deer, Yang Dingsheng thanked profusely, “Many thanks to Senior White Deer!”

“Call me Lord White Deer!”

“Yes… I should. Many thanks to Lord White Deer.” Yang Dingsheng changed his address immediately. He knew that the White Deer was a pinnacle existence in the Thirteen Universes. He didn’t think that it was weird as monsters at their level had some weird temperament.

Huang Xiaolong watched as the White Deer retrieved the universe-level spiritual veins and said, “Since we’re done here, bring me to the Universe Source Stone.”

The Universe Source Stone was an item that could secure the future of the Thirteen Universes. It was of utmost importance that Huang Xiaolong obtained it in order to stop the destruction.

“Relax. The location of the Universe Source Stone is extremely secret. No one other than me knows of its location,” The White Deer muttered when it saw the anxious expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “However, you’re not allowed to resent me when you fail to obtain the Universe Source Stone. I can only tell you its location.”

“Yeah. Getting it is my problem.” Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Lead the way.”

Without wasting any more time, the White Deer brought Huang Xiaolong towards the depths of the White Deer Cave.

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

As the three of them traveled deeper and deeper into the White Deer Cave, Huang Xiaolong chatted happily with Yang Dingsheng. They were the only ones talking and when it came to Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer, the conversation became stale.

Huang Xiaolong discovered that the surroundings were getting quieter and quieter as they went deeper into the cave.

After another month, the White Deer finally stopped.

There wasn’t anywhere else to go!

A giant wall stood before the trio, and it was formed completely with black ice. No one knew how thick the wall of black ice was, but it extended infinitely.

“This is a wall of Black Source Ice!” The White Deer explained.

“Universe Black Source Ice?!” Yang Dingsheng sucked in a cold breath.

The Black Source Ice was the most terrifying source of frost in the Thirteen Universes. Even if half-step Universe Gods touched a little bit of it, they would turn into a statue of ice.

“That’s right. It’s Black Source Ice.” A complicated look could be seen on the White Deer’s face.

“Is the Universe Source Stone sealed within?!” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Yes. Even though I can’t see it, I can tell that it’s in there. As the owner of the White Deer Cave, nothing escapes from my detection.” However, it shook its head soon after. “It’s too bad that I can’t tear open the wall of Black Source Ice…”

Even though it was the owner of the White Deer Cave and a pinnacle existence in the Thirteen Universes, it was unable to shatter the wall of Black Source Ice.

“How deep is it hidden?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Probably a hundred thousand miles.” The White Deer sighed.

“A hundred thousand miles?!” Yang Dingsheng gasped in fright.

There wasn’t a need to mention a hundred thousand miles. It wasn’t possible for them to break through a hundred feet!

Yang Dingsheng looked at Huang Xiaolong and shook his head, “Brother Huang, why don’t we leave it at this?”

“The Universe Origin Fires should be able to burn through the Black Source Ice, right?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

Both the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng stared at him in shock.

“Yeah, the Black Source Ice might be the source of all frost in the universes, but you should be able to… However, it’s not easy for you to obtain the Universe Origin Fires,” The White Deer explained.

A brilliant ball of flame emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body as soon as the White Deer spoke.

With their jaws dropping in fright, they stared at Huang Xiaolong like they were looking at a monster.

“White Tiger Origin Fire?” The White Deer shook its head slowly. “Without the other fires, you probably won’t get far.”
