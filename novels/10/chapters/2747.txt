Chapter 2748: Do You Know Why I Didn’t Kill You Earlier?

Apart from Huang Xiaolong’s original group of seven people, there were only sixty-plus people, including Cangqiong Old Man, Wang Xueru, and the Cangqiong Sacred Lands’ remaining True Saints high in the air. Surprisingly, this paltry number of people seemed to be waiting for them.

A second later, Chen Birui reacted and laughed, “One, two, three, four… sixty-four people all in all! Cangqiong Old Man plans to fend off the three sacred lands’ great armies by relying on these sixty-four people?! Funny, this is so funny!”

Their loud laughter reverberated in the air.

Everyone was shaking their heads at this sight.

Was there any hope in having sixty-four people against three sacred lands’ armies?

Moreover, among these sixty-four people, there were only seven Primal Ancestors, the rest were all True Saints. In other experts’ eyes, the True Saints in Huang Xiaolong’s group were merely decorations. Therefore, the real power facing the three sacred lands’ great armies were Cangqiong Old man, Duan Feng, and the other five people.

At the thought of this, everyone felt that Cangqiong Sacred Land was simply a ridiculous joke. It was ridiculous that Cangqiong Old Man thought that Cangqiong Sacred Land would be able to deter the three armies with the seven of them.

Tang Long looked at the seemingly desolate group of sixty-four people, and a cold jeer escaped his mouth. His gaze shifted from Cangqiong Old Man to Huang Xiaolong, and killing intent exploded in his eyes.

Before long, Tang Long’s group was standing in front of Cangqiong City.

In the air above Cangqiong City, lights flowed. These ripples of light came from the Cangqiong Grand Formation’s barrier, and looking at the shining barrier, Han Mo smiled coldly. He shouted at Cangqiong Old Man, “Old Man Cangqiong, do you really want us to smash down this rubbish formation with a punch to drag you all out and pinch you to death?”

“I advise you not to hold on to hazy hope. Open the grand formation now, and then roll out here to our feet, and beg for your lives, beg us to spare you!” Han Mo’s voice carried a unique power, traveling through the formation, into Huang Xiaolong, Cangqiong Old Man, and the others’ ears.

This was a kind of grand dao art with temptation and deterrence effects.

Cangqiong Old Man did not respond, but Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent voice sounded instead, “All of you are finally here. You are really slow.”

Everyone was stunned for a second that it was Huang Xiaolong who responded.

Finally here? Really slow?

Was Huang Xiaolong disdainful of the speed the three sacred lands’ armies had taken to reach Cangqiong Sacred Land?

Chu Yifan laughed at Huang Xiaolong’s words, “Brat, who are you talking to? Do you have the right to open your mouth? Are you even qualified to speak with us?”

Indeed, at any other time, someone with Huang Xiaolong’s identity as a Ninth Heaven True Saint disciple wouldn’t even qualify to meet people like Tang Long and Han Mo face to face, much less, speak to them. As patriarchs of their own sacred lands, even some Primal Ancestors hardly got a chance to have an audience with Tang Long, Han Mo, or Chu Yifan.

Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, and the others’ expressions darkened after hearing Chu Yifan mock Huang Xiaolong.

“In my eyes, you don’t even qualify to carry the Young Lord’s shoes,” Duan Feng stated coldly as he locked onto Chu Yifan. If Huang Xiaolong’s identity as the Son of Creation was revealed, only Dao Venerables were qualified to carry his shoes.

Everyone slightly blanked after hearing that.

Anger rose to Chu Yifan’s face, but he laughed loudly instead and said, “I don’t qualify to carry this brat’s shoes?! Are you saying that I don’t qualify to carry this brat’s shoes?”

Killing intent surged in his chest.

“You’re Duan Feng, right?” Tang Long interjected as he looked at Tang Long, “Although Huang Xiaolong has shown goodwill towards you in the past, you’re still a mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor. Is it necessary for you to serve a mere Ninth Heaven True Saint to pay back the debt? This is an insult to your status, so why don’t you come over to our Tang Dragon Sacred Land? As long as you’re willing to come, I will give you the position of Eldest Worshiped Expert, and your annual cultivation resources will be three times higher than other worshiped experts!”

Although the Tang Dragon Sacred Land didn’t lack worshiped experts, the position of Eldest Worshiped Expert was empty.

Many people’s faces tightened nervously as they heard Tang Long making his offer to Duan Feng, but they were aware that a mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor was worthy of a sacred land to lure him in with generous remuneration.

Duan Feng couldn’t help but laugh when Tang Long told him that following Huang Xiaolong was an insult to his identity, and he shot him a pitying look.

However, Duan Feng did not respond to Tang Long as he was too lazy to explain. Not to mention they were going to understand the reason behind his reaction very soon.

On the other hand, Han Mo spoke to Mo Zhi, “You should be Mo Zhi, right? If you’re willing to serve my Freezing Desert Sacred Land, I will welcome you. I can promise that your yearly cultivation resources will be double of the other worshiped experts.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly as he watched Tang Long and Han Mo trying to dig away his people right in front of him by ignoring his presence. It looked like he still had to work on his cultivation and break through to Primal Ancestor Realm as soon as possible. The Ninth Heaven True Saint might be sufficient to deter many in the Cangqiong Holy World, but here in the Divine Tuo Holy World, this level of strength seemed to be a little weak.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly said to Duan Feng, “Open the formation.”

This rendered many people confused. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

A cold snort escaped Chen Birui’s lips. In his opinion, Huang Xiaolong was going to open the formation to kowtow and beg Tang Long and Han Mo for his life. His disciple, Li Fuyang, was previously slapped by Zi Dongping, and he was watching with gloating eyes.

“Huang Xiaolong, do you think by coming out and begging on your knees, Patriarch Tang Long, Patriarch Han Mo, and Patriarch Chu Yifan would spare you?” Chen Birui snickered, “Even if you knock your head until a big pit appears in this Cangqiong Sacred Land, you still can’t escape death today!”

In the distance, the All-Heavens Sacred Land’s Ren Yifei whispered to his master, “Master, you said that the Cangqiong Sacred Land might have trump cards, but it looks like Huang Xiaolong is going to beg for his life. What trump cards could the Cangqiong Sacred Land have?”

All-Heavens Sacred Land’s patriarch looked doubtful. Did I guess wrongly?

In the meantime, Duan Feng had opened a pathway through the Cangqiong City’s grand formation, and Huang Xiaolong was seen walking out. He looked at Chen Birui and asked meaningfully, “Do you know why I didn’t kill you in the last couple of days, and why I wanted you to live until today?”

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over Chen Birui, Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the other six worshiped experts.

All six worshiped experts didn't know what to think.

But Chen Birui reacted quickly, laughing mockingly as he said, “It sounds like you deliberately kept me alive waiting for today. Funny, so funny. Brat, do you know why I didn’t take the opportunity to kill you all these days? Why I wanted to let you live until today?” He paused briefly before continuing, “Because I am leaving your lives for Patriarch Tang!”

Chen Birui and the others laughter rang in the air.

Huang Xiaolong’s fist punched towards Chen Birui faster than lightning.

Everyone was astonished that Huang Xiaolong dared to attack Chen Birui.

“This brat’s gone crazy.” One of the Primal Ancestors couldn’t help being sarcastic.

Chen Birui didn’t retaliate, and he stood there leisurely, letting Huang Xiaolong’s fist land on him. Even if he were to let a Ninth Heaven True Saint hit his late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm dao physique a thousand times, he wouldn’t even break his skin.

Boom!

Huang Xiaolong’s fist landed accurately on Chen Birui’s body.

“Bang!” Suddenly, there was horror in Chen Birui’s eyes, and in the next second, he exploded. Violent grand dao energy and spiritual energy swept outward.

Everyone’s heart missed a beat with the sound of the thunderous explosion.
