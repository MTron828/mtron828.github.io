Chapter 2627: Ran Away?

The night passed quietly, and complex emotions filled the hearts of those present.

Huang Xiaolong swallowed holy pills and continued his cultivation.

Over the past few years, Huang Xiaolong had obtained quite a number of inheritances and treasures. He had more than enough holy pills to squander.

As a gloomy light shone down on the lands the next day, several members of the Otherworldly Mansion came over to inform Huang Xiaolong of Yuan Qianxing’s challenge.

“Will you accept Yuan Qianxing’s challenge?” One of the elders, Chen Mingfei, looked at Huang Xiaolong and asked casually.

On the surface, Chen Mingfei appeared to be rather courteous.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong could tell that he was gloating behind his smiles.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “There’s no need to rush. The date of the challenge hasn’t been set yet. According to the rules of the mansion, I can reply any time I wish before the date of the challenge.”

In other words, if the battle was set to be ten years later, Huang Xiaolong could easily give his reply one day before the battle was set to begin.

Chen Mingfei was startled, but he soon regained his composure, “Young Master Huang Xiaolong, the date of the challenge will be decided soon. It’s a matter of time before it happens. Why don’t you just give me a reply now, and I’ll be able to inform the various parties involved?”

As soon as the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong sent him flying through the air with a slap.

When Chen Mingfei slammed into the ground, he touched his face only to realize that it had swelled to the size of a pig’s head. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and roared, “You!”

“Who do you think you are?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “Get lost right now. Otherwise, you can’t blame me for crippling you!”

Since Chen Mingfei was on Yuan Qianxing’s side, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to be courteous to him.

As chills crept down Chen Mingfei’s spine, he couldn’t help but run after realizing that Huang Xiaolong was serious. In the past, Huang Xiaolong had even dared to kill vice hall masters. He would be crazy if he thought that the identity of an elder was enough to protect him.

Huang Xiaolong snorted and retracted his gaze from the fleeing Chen Mingfei as he continued cultivating.

……

Inside a luxurious mansion in the Otherworldly Mansion…

“Huang Xiaolong should have received the news.” Yuan Qianxing snorted coldly, “I wonder what he’ll choose…”

Yuan Wangfeng laughed, “Does he have a choice? Unless he’s tired of living, he will definitely choose to reject the challenge!”

All of a sudden, a disciple of the Myriad Origin Race entered the hall to report on Huang Xiaolong’s actions related to Chen Mingfei.

“No reply?” Yuan Wangfeng smiled, “It looks like the brat is planning on dragging this out.”

Yuan Qianxing snorted, “He can’t escape for long.” Turning to Yuan Wangfeng and the other experts of the Myriad Origin Race, he ordered, “Send some men down to watch him. Do not allow him to run away.”

“Young Master, you can count on us!”

After Chen Mingfei started spreading rumors that Huang Xiaolong was too much of a wuss to accept the challenge, the entire mansion heard of the news.

When Chen Muguang heard it, he mocked, “Huang Xiaolong is too much of a coward! He’s a joke of the human race! Does he really think that Young Master Yuan Qianxing wouldn’t be able to touch him if he refuses to give a reply?”

An expert from the Chen Luo Sect laughed, “This matter is of great importance. It doesn’t matter if Huang Xiaolong refuses to give a reply or not. After all, he’s not the type to run away from a challenge.”

Chen Muguang was enraged when he heard what the man said. “Aren’t you always standing on Huang Xiaolong’s side?! He might be a human, but he’s also the young patriarch of the Purple Spider Race! Even if he gains power in the future, he won’t lift a finger to help us!”

“I’ve seen a lot of people like Huang Xiaolong. He’s a white-eyed wolf. When he gains power in the future, he might even kill all of us for standing against him!”

Chen Mugaung reprimanded.

The experts from the Chen Luo Sect frowned.

“Help me arrange a meeting with Young Master Yuan Qianxing,” Chen Muguang said.

The faces of those sitting in the hall changed immediately.

“Young Sect Master, this…,” someone quickly spoke up. “Now that Huang Xiaolong and Yuan Qianxing are fighting amongst themselves, if our sect pays a visit to Yuan Qianxing, the members of the human race will definitely look down on us!”

“That’s right, Young Sect Master, Yuan Qianxing belongs to the alien race. They regard us as slaves, and if we go…,” several other people voiced their concerns.

Chen Muguang berated, “What do you guys know?! Yuan Qianxing is bound to succeed! It’s a matter of time before Huang Xiaolong is killed! Now is the best time for us to surrender to Young Master Yuan Qianxing and show our loyalty to him! When he becomes the Mansion Master, we will be rewarded heavily!”

“With his support, our Chen Luo Sect will rise through the ranks!”

Chen Muguang envisioned the future.

“Young Sect Master, this matter is of great importance. We should report this to the Sect Master and allow him to make the decision,” several people tried to persuade their delusional young sect master.

“My father has always been indecisive. That's the reason our Chen Luo Sect is in the dumps right now! There’s no need to make a report to him! I can make this decision for our sect!” Chen Muguang said firmly.

“Enough! All of you are here to carry out my orders. Do as you’re told!”

In fact, Chen Muguang had already prepared a giant gift for Yuan Qianxing. All he had to do was to present it.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he left the Otherworldly Mansion that very night. He wanted to break through to the Third Heaven True Saint Realm in peace.

Of course, before he left, he informed Long Shengtian in hopes that the Deputy Mansion Master would be able to delay the challenge for as long as he could.

“What? Huang Xiaolong is missing?!” Not long after Huang Xiaolong left, Yuan Qianxing received the news. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Seal off the Otherworldly Mansion! We can’t let him escape!” Yuan Qianxing roared in anger.

“What? Huang Xiaolong ran away?! Is he really that afraid to die?!”

“This is impossible! How can he possibly run away!?”

“It’s true! Many disciples went to pay him a visit, but the entire peak has been sealed off. No one knows where Huang Xiaolong went, and I heard that Long Shengtian gave the order to seal off the Otherworldly Mansion. What a loser! To think that I used to admire a coward like that!”

“Actually, you can’t blame him. You can’t expect him to sit there and wait for Yuan Qianxing to kill him. I would have also escaped right away if I were in his shoes because Yuan Qianxing would have killed me as soon as he ascended to his position! At that time, there would be nowhere left for me to go!”

Discussions filled the mansion in an instant, but without a doubt, all of them were mocking Huang Xiaolong for being a coward.

Some even demanded for the upper echelons of the Otherworldly Mansion to remove Huang Xiaolong’s qualification as a mansion master candidate!
