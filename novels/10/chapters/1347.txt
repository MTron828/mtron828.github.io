“The Firmament Bear’s soul crystal?!” Huang Xiaolong turned to the little cow with uncertainty. It was obvious that he had not heard of the Firmament Bear’s soul crystal.

The grandmist chaos era was followed by the desolate era. Both of these eras predated the existence of the Divine World. Therefore, if this was really the so-called desolate era Firmament Bear’s soul crystal, then it was indeed a rare and precious treasure. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It took the little cow sometime before she managed to rein in her excitement. After she calmed down, she explained to Huang Xiaolong, “Hahaha, Xiaolong, with this Firmament Bear’s soul crystal, you can absolutely breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm within ten years!” She couldn’t contain her excitement.

Huang Xiaolong quivered as joy shone from his eyes. “Are you saying that this Firmament Bear’s soul crystal can help my soul to achieve perfection within a decade?!”

The little cow rolled her eyes. Her expression was obviously saying ‘you-ignorant-bumpkin.’ She then explained further “Remember we talked about 100 being a perfect score for a soul, during our last conversation?! But in truth, a soul is not really perfect even at 100, it can merely be considered as a passing mark. You can condense an avatar when you breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm if your soul is at 100, however, there are some freak geniuses who have managed to achieve 1000, even 2000 or 3000. The stronger your soul is, the stronger the avatar you condense!”

Her words sent waves of shock in Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er’s hearts.

Something like this even exists?!!

“Then, there is no limit to how strong one’s soul can be?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask.

The little cow shook her head. “That is not the case. An Ancestor God Realm cultivator’s soul can achieve only a score of up till 10,000. But I’ve never seen any genius that could achieve that in my entire life. The highest score that I have seen is close to 9,100 plus or minus!”

“Close to 9,100 plus or minus!” Feng Er and the others gasped in astonishment.

10,000 was the limit, thus 9,100 was surely a terrifying figure.

“Who was it?!” Huang Xiaolong urged, “The Ancient Heavenly Emperor?!”

But the little cow shook her head again. “Even though the Ancient Heavenly Emperor was Divine World’s genius in a billion years, according to what I know, his soul did not even reach 9,000. His score had probably reached the upper limit of 8,000, maybe almost 9,000!” She paused momentarily, then added, “In truth, the person who reached close to 9,100 plus or minus is somewhat related to you!”

“Somewhat related to me?!” Huang Xiaolong was confused. When and how did he know such an amazing character?

“Yes, related to you!” The little cow softly added, “The Grandmist Parasitic Medium!”

The Grandmist Parasitic Medium! The words jarred Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

"The King of Grandmist!" Huang Xiaolong blurted out the first person that came to his mind. The person who created the Grandmist Parasitic Medium—the King of Grandmist!

The little cow nodded, "Correct, it was the King of Grandmist. Since you’ve successfully cultivated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, you can be considered as his second disciple!” But the little cow suddenly changed the subject in the middle of her explanation. It was obvious that she didn’t want to speak of the King of Grandmist any further. Her attention returned to the Firmament Bear’s soul crystal, and said, “The desolate era’s Firmament Bear Tribe’s tribesmen are innately born with a strong soul, and this Firmament Bear’s soul crystal is the crystallization of a Firmament Bear’s soul force. Every fist-sized crystal is enough to strengthen your soul to an unimaginable degree!”

“There are actually several thousand pieces of Firmament Bear’s soul crystals here. They definitely could strengthen your soul to the highest limit!”

Huang Xiaolong’s fists were clenched tightly as he tried to control his excitement.

“Where did you guys find these Firmament Bear’s soul crystals?” The little cow asked the Sand Waves Sect’s Ancestor Li Ye.

Li Ye shook his head and explained, “These were found by Senior Brother Song Qi in a perilous land. At that time, we didn’t even know what these crystals were. Therefore, they were just placed here in the treasury. Senior Brother Song Qi went to the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield with the other two Seniors, and has yet to return."

Huang Xiaolong’s heart was moved, “Try to contact them, see if they reply.”

Li Ye took out his communication talisman and tried to contact the other three Sand Waves Sect’s Ancestors. After a while, he shook his head and reported to Huang Xiaolong, “No reply from Senior Brother Song Qi, or other two Senior Brothers. We’ve tried contacting them before, but we haven’t been able to establish any communication with them.”

Huang Xiaolong was a little disappointed at the result.

It seems, those three Sand Waves Sect’s Ancestors have most likely fallen.

That being the case, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to get the location of Firmament Bear’s soul crystals from Song Qi.

Huang Xiaolong subsequently collected all the soul crystals, Wishful Golden Flower, and Black Flames Ganoderma into his Ghost Buddha Ring. He then took a stroll around the Sand Waves Sect’s treasury, collecting away the chaos spiritual herbs, and chaos spiritual pills that he deemed useful.

Half a day later, the group stepped out from the treasury.

Since Huang Xiaolong had discovered the Firmament Bear’s soul crystals, Wishful Golden Flowers, and the Black Flames Ganoderma, there wasn’t any need for him to head over to the Blood Imperial Sect in the Scarlet One World. Therefore, he decided to stay in the Sand Waves Sect to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm!

He planned to return to the Vientiane World surface after he has advanced to the Ancestor God Realm. And his immediate goal was to conquer the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan upon his return to the Vientiane World Surface.

And of course, he had not forgotten about the Blood Eye Devil Stele!

With that, Huang Xiaolong’s group stayed in the Sand Waves Sect’s headquarters to cultivate.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong was frowning as he listened to Deng Qishun’s report. They had failed to find Cao Fang and Chen Wenli’s avatars.

“Subordinates have failed the Manor Lord. Please mete out the punishment for your subordinates.” Deng Qishun, Zheng Guowen, and the others pleaded guilty on their knees.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and said, “It’s not your fault, rise.” Since Cao Fang and Chen Wenli’s avatars had escaped, they might cause some troubles in the future. But Huang Xiaolong soon threw the matter out of his mind. He already had lots of enemies, a couple more enemies didn’t make much of a difference.

Still, Huang Xiaolong instructed Deng Qishun to order the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders to put forth their best efforts in hunting down Cao Fang and Chen Wenli’s avatars in the whole Reverence World.

After that, Huang Xiaolong ordered the Sand Waves Sect’s subordinates to leave him and his group undisturbed unless it was an emergency, before sending them away. He had planned to enter seclusion to refine the Firmament Bear’s soul crystals, and breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm.

The Sand Waves Sect’s headquarters were located inside a palace. It contained the richest spiritual energy. Huang Xiaolong took out the Blue Spectre Spring river and sat cross-legged inside it. Next, he took out one of the Firmament Bear’s soul crystals.

A Firmament Bear’s soul crystal was about the size of a fist and it was reflecting luster like a black diamond.

Huang Xiaolong adjusted his mind, and ran the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. Instantly, a mysterious black energy flowed out from the Firmament Bear’s soul crystal and entered through the crown of his head.

His three supreme godheads shook, emitting resplendent lights as his soul grew stronger rapidly.

If Huang Xiaolong’s soul was to be described as a dried sea, then the Firmament Bear’s soul crystal’s energy was like the water from a big river rushing down to fill up that dried sea.

The Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell released rain of moon essence that also supported Huang Xiaolong’s soul. However compared to the Firmament Bear’s soul crystal’s energy, the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell’s moon essence energy was like a water pipe.

In truth, Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation realm was too low. Therefore, the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell’s power was limited.

The chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool too was releasing waves of chaos lightning qi to temper his body.

As he began to cultivate, the four divine fire spirits inside his body started devouring the gray chaos spiritual energy falling from the void.
