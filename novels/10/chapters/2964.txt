Chapter 2965: In My Eyes, You’re A W*ssy

The Sword Venerable’s personal disciple, Yan Bubi, smiled humbly when he heard voices of agreement around him, “Although I have inherited master’s skills, Huang Xiaolong is someone with Huang Long Bloodline, and he can still take ten moves from me. But, I am confident that I can defeat him within twenty moves. I will make him beg for his life on his knees!”

The Poison Bodach’s personal disciple, Liu Ran, chuckled knowingly, “Brother Yan Bubi is too modest, once your invincible sword dao makes its appearance, not many people can last twenty moves against you!”

Everyone agreed loudly.

Although Ancestor Xuan had leaked out that Huang Xiaolong had obtained the Tree of Beginning, he had also deliberately hidden the fact that Huang Xiaolong had a colony of black-eyed poisonous spiders. He also had not mentioned Huang Xiaolong’s battle prowess. Therefore, outsiders were not aware that Huang Xiaolong had a colony of black-eyed poisonous spiders, and did not know Huang Xiaolong could easily defeat the Frost Eye Race’s Young Patriarch Bing Jun who held the race’s Holy Staff.

Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and the others were even more ignorant of Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation realm and battle prowess. Hence, these people estimated that Huang Xiaolong couldn’t last twenty moves against Yan Bubi.

Their perception of Huang Xiaolong remained at the time of the Creation Ceremony.

When Huang Xiaolong defeated Huang Shuai, many concluded that Huang Xiaolong's battle strength was at par with an average Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable expert, at most.

Yan Bubi was a mid-Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable, but he was definitely not included amongst the average experts as he was someone that could leapfrog challenge an Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable realm, and was a genius of an era.

"It is said that Young Lady Yu Yue and Yin Yue would be attending the upcoming auction," a handsome young man clad in a bright crimson battle robe, seated further down from Liu Ran, said suddenly.

This young man’s name was Peng Xuan, and although his strength was slightly lower than Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, and Qiu Ruopeng, his master was also a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm old monster.

More than half of this group of thirty-plus people, either had a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm master or patriarch.

In the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, only the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng was a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert, however, the Divine Tuo Holy World was a vast world, and there were countless top-tier creeds, and also genesis races that were comparable to top-tier creeds.

Though Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and Nine-headed Tree Demon were neither patriarchs of top-tier creeds nor patriarchs of genesis races, they were an early generation of powerful experts, and had lived for a long time. Legend had it that before the Divine Tuo Holy World’s Dragon Fish Creed, Divination Creed, and other creeds were formed, old monsters like Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and Nine-headed Tree Demon already had a certain degree of reputation.

When Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and others heard Yu Yue, and Yin Yue would be attending the auction, their eyes lit up.

But then came Peng Xuan’s sigh, “Unfortunately, the three moons had sworn to only wed a person with eleven high-order Saint Fates, Huang Xiaolong that b*stard got lucky.”

Yan Bubi was immediately displeased upon hearing that. “Young Lady Yu Yue, Yin Yue, and Feng Yue merely said that in jest. How could they marry the same person.”

Liu Ran chimed in, “That’s right, with the three moons beauty and talent, Huang Xiaolong alone cannot handle the three of them.”

Qiu Ruopeng sneered, “Even if Huang Xiaolong has the guts to marry the three moons, he would have to see if our fists agree or not.”

At this time, outside the Dragon Fish City’s gates, a person descended to the ground. This was Huang Xiaolong who had rushed over.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression was tepid, watching the flow of experts, and he joined the current into the city.

Although Huang Xiaolong had not appeared in public for two hundred years, he was still recognized immediately upon entering Dragon Fish City.

“It’s, it’s His Highness Huang Xiaolong! His Highness Huang Xiaolong is here in the Dragon Fish City!”

“It’s really His Highness Huang Xiaolong! I saw him battling Huang Shuai outside the city from afar!”

In an instant, a wave of excitement swept the streets.

“What’s Huang Xiaolong doing here? For the auction? The Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable and Nine-headed Tree Demon’s personal disciples are all here in the city, but he dares to show up in such an upright manner when the whole world knows he has the Tree of Beginning! Without the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch and the others by his side, Huang Xiaolong is looking to get abused here!”

While everyone was shocked and confused to see Huang Xiaolong appear, a top-tier creed’s expert in the crowd mocked Huang Xiaolong.

He called Huang Xiaolong by his name with a contemptuous tone. There were many creeds and sacred lands’ experts who revered Huang Xiaolong, but clearly, not all of them shared the similar views and sentiments.

Despite the sea of people in the noisy streets, Huang Xiaolong still captured the mocking words, as he looked straight at that expert, and an overwhelming heavenly might rushed from Huang Xiaolong’s body and slammed onto him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Kneel!” Huang Xiaolong ordered indifferently but his voice thundered in that expert’s mind, jarring his dao soul senseless.

That person was a Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable expert, but was he capable of resisting Huang Xiaolong’s aura?!

The space above his head crumbled upon him as a terrifying force slammed onto his body, and forced him to fall on his knees.

“It’s the Royal Peacock Creed’s vice hall master, Guo Borong!” Some of the experts nearby recognized who the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable expert was.

The Royal Peacock Creed was a top-tier creed located in the far south of Divine Tuo Holy World. In terms of strength, the Royal Peacock Creed stood at the same height at the Divination Creed and Dragon Fish Creed.

Guo Borong was forced to kneel under the pressure of Huang Xiaolong’s heavenly might, and his face was beet red from resistance, anger, and humiliation. He glared ferociously at Huang Xiaolong and shouted, “Huang Xiaolong, you’ve only got enough guts to bully someone weak like me. More than a hundred years have passed since Poison Bodach, Nine-headed Tree Demon, Sword Venerable, and the others razed Cangqiong Sacred land to the ground, but you didn’t even dare to lift your head out of the hole you’ve been hiding!”

“What Son of Creation?! You’re just a w*ssy in my eyes!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong’s face turned a little colder as he raised a finger and sent a streak of absolute blaze power onto Guo Borong’s body. Instead of incinerating Guo Borong to ashes immediately, he controlled the power of absolute blaze to burn through Guo Borong’s flesh and bones part by part. For a moment, the scent of barbecue permeated the streets.

Guo Borong shrieked miserably and struggled violently, wanting to get up to fight desperately with Huang Xiaolong, but he was pinned where he was, while the power of absolute blaze devoured his life.

Other experts amongst the crowd that were similarly dissatisfied with Huang Xiaolong paled, and those who wanted to ambush Huang Xiaolong secretly and grab the Tree of Beginning had to withdraw their hands.

Yes, they could force Huang Xiaolong to take out the Tree of Beginning relying on the forces behind them, but Huang Xiaolong was no pushover and definitely not someone the average Dao Venerable experts could offend.

As the power of Huang Xiaolong’s absolute blaze burned Guo Borong’s body, a berth opened through the crowd as the Sword Venerable’s other two personal disciples sent several Boundary Emperor Creed’s core disciples flying with a palm strike.

“You guys from the Boundary Emperor Creed don’t think you’re so great for holding onto Huang Xiaolong’s big thigh! Huang Xiaolong won’t dare to let out a fart even if we kill all of you now. Didn’t you see that a hundred years after we destroyed the Cangqiong Sacred Land, did Huang Xiaolong say anything to the Sword Venerable?”

“Get over here now!”

The Sword Venerable’s two personal disciples mocked and ridiculed the several Boundary Emperor Creed’s disciples.
