Xu Baisheng’s eyes were red-rimmed with tears as he asked Xu Yong’s group, “Do you know Xu Baiqiang, Xu Baifeng, and Xu Huanying?”

Xu Yong and the other two void devil beasts were surprised by Xu Baisheng’s question. Xu Yong answered, “Lord Envoy knows our Grandfather Xu Baiqiang and Xu Baifeng? Xu Huanying is my Great-grandfather!”

“What?! Big brother and Second Brother are your grandfathers?” Xu Baisheng asked excitedly. “Xu Baiqiang and Xi Baifeng are my Big Brother and Second Brother, and Xu Huanying is my father!”

Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi looked at Xu Baisheng with disbelief and excitement as they hesitated, and asked, “Then... Lord Envoy, y-you are?”

“My name is Xu Baisheng. I entered the Divine World several hundred years ago, but I was sealed within one of the world surfaces in the Divine World. I was rescued by Senior Xiaoniu some years back!” Xu Baisheng briefly explained.

“You, you are our Granduncle?!” Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi blurted out in astonishment.

The Void Devil Beast Clan’s old records had mentioned Xu Baisheng as one of the rare geniuses of the Void Devil Beast Clan, but Xu Baisheng had suddenly disappeared several hundred million years ago. In truth, Xu Baisheng was sealed within one of the Divine World’s world surfaces.

“Yes, I am Xu Baisheng.” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng confirmed, ecstatic as he continued, “I had not expected you to be Big Brother and Second Brother’s younger generations!”

Even Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, Feng Er, and the rest were amazed by the coincidence.

Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi suddenly plopped down on their knees before Xu Baisheng, and cried loudly.

"Granduncle, Grandfather and the rest, the rest...!" Xu Yong’s voice choked, "Grandfather and the others had fled to the Divine World with us, but one year ago, when we are chased by the four Emperor Palaces’ experts, Grandfather and Great-grandfather fought with the four Emperor Palaces’ experts to save us!"

At this point, there was no need to say anything further.

Xu Baisheng’s face turned pale as he tried I say, “You’re saying... that my Big brother, Second brother, and my Father, they, they...!” He was afraid to complete the sentence.

“Since then we’ve lost contact with Grandfather and Great-grandfather. We don’t know what happened to Grandfather and Great-grandfather, but it is likely that they...” Xu Jiang said despondently, and his face was filled with grief.

Most likely, their Grandfather and Great-grandfather had fallen!

The worst ending was they were killed by the four Emperor Palaces’ experts. A little better was they were captured by the four Emperor Palaces’ experts, but the chances of them escaping were very slim.

Hatred and wrath roiled in Xu Baisheng’s eyes as he roared loudly, “I want revenge, I want revenge!” His breathing became heavy and tumultuous.

But, right at this time, a hoof smacked heavily on Xu Baisheng’s head, and a scolding ensued, “Revenge? Revenge your head!”

Xu Baisheng was dumbstruck on the spot but only for a second. Fury erupted in his heart as he turned around. When he saw who it was, it was like a bucket of ice water was being poured over his head. He felt wronged and cried out sadly, “Senior Xiaoniu.”

The one who had smacked his head was none other than the little cow.

Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi were stupefied as they looked at the little cow. ‘Is this cow the ‘Senior Xiaoniu’ that their Granduncle had mentioned earlier? Had this cow rescued their Granduncle?’

The little cow asked Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi, “Just now, you three mentioned that Xu Changtian has come to the Divine World’s Devil Abyss several million years ago, right?”

Xu Changtian?!

Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi blanked for a second at her question but soon reacted as they realized that the little cow was using the full name of their Void Devil Beast Clan’s Old Ancestor. All three were enraged by the disrespect shown by the little cow.

Their Void Devil Beast Clan’s Old Ancestor was a venerable existence in their hearts, but this little azure cow was talking about their old Ancestor by using his name without the honorifics!

Even if you rescued Granduncle, you cannot be so insolent!

Xu Baisheng’s heart dropped to his stomach when he noticed the enraged expressions on the three kids’ faces. He swiftly snapped at them, “What are you three doing?! Senior Xiaoniu is a friend of our Old Ancestor!”

Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi were dumbfounded. What? What?! For real?!

The little cow looked at the shocked expressions on the three void devil beasts’ faces, and harrumphed inwardly. A light glimmered at her neck as a golden ring appeared from the light. It was exuding boundless devil qi from the bell-like black hole that was on top of the golden ring.

Seeing this golden ring, the three Void Devil Beast Clan’s juniors trembled, even their words were shaking, “Gold-Golden Void Bell Ring!”

The Golden Void Bell Ring was the Void Devil Beast Clan’s supreme artifact. It was also Xu Changtian’s most used artifact, as the Void Devil Beast Clan’s core disciples, Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi naturally recognized it.

"Speak, and tell me everything you know in detail." The little cow drawled lazily. "Tell me the situation after Xu Changtian sneaked into the Divine World!”

Huang Xiaolong was speechless looking at the little cow’s lazy, nonchalant manner.

This old cow!

Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi quickly converged their anger and respectfully complied. They quickly recounted what they knew to the little cow without any concealment. Even though the three of them were Void Devil Beast Clan’s core disciples, there was a lot that they didn’t know about Xu Changtian. In short, they only knew Xu Changtian had sneaked into the Divine World’s Devil Abyss to look for some kind of treasure.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow exchanged a silent glance.

Treasure?

The two thought of the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s treasure - the Ancient Heavenly Court.

The two of them knew the Ancient Heavenly Court treasure was somewhere in the depths of the Devil Abyss, and it was very likely that Xu Changtian has entered the Devil Abyss for the Ancient Heavenly Court.

After all, with Xu Changtian’s identity, there was no other treasure that could tempt him into the Devil Abyss regardless of the risks and dangers.

Then again, this was merely Huang Xiaolong’s guess. Only Xu Changtian knew if he was searching for the Ancient Heavenly Court in the Devil Abyss or something else.

“But, our Great-grandfather might know what the Old Ancestor was searching for in the Devil Abyss.” Xu Yong suddenly added.

“My father might know...?!” Xu Baisheng repeated.

“Yes, Granduncle. Before the Old Ancestor left for the Devil Abyss, he had gathered Great-Grandfather and several others to tell them something, therefore, I think, Great-grandfather should have definitely known.” Xu Yong explained.

Huang Xiaolong frowned. He had a feeling that Xu Baisheng’s Father was already killed by the four Emperor Palaces’ experts. Still, better to make sure.

“Master, I want revenge!” Xu Baisheng said to Huang Xiaolong, and his voice was filled with intense hatred towards the four Emperor Palaces, Black Ant Clan, and the Demonic Bone Clan. “I want to annihilate the four Emperor Palaces, Black Ant Clan, and Demonic Bone Clan!”

Huang Xiaolong spoke with certainty, “Don’t worry, we will help you collect the Void Devil Beast Clan’s debt of blood!”

Xu Baisheng looked gratefully at Huang Xiaolong and fell to his knees, heavily knocking his forehead against the floor and said, “Thank you, Master!”

Huang Xiaolong told him to stand up.

“It’s easier said than done to avenge the Void Devil Beast Clan!” The little cow struck them with reality. “Put aside the Black Ant Clan and Demonic Bone Clan, just the four Emperor Palaces’ branch forces would be enough to annihilate you several times repeatedly.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered, ‘right ah, it was easier said than done to annihilate the four Emperor Palaces based on his current strength.’

The four Emperor Palaces were giants that had existed since the desolate era, standing tall for billions of years with their roots deeply entrenched in the Divine World. Even the current Heavenly Court would find it troublesome to uproot the four Emperor Palaces.
