Chapter 374: Passing Through the Blessed Buddha Empire

Carrying out the Temple Preceptor’s order, Liu Yang brought fifteen sets of Divine Dragon Armor and six Deities Templar Elders and headed toward Starcloud Continent’s Asura’s Gate headquarters.

By this time, the battle in Luo Tong Royal City had reached Duanren Empire, spreading to neighboring empires. It was like a tornado that kept growing bigger, reaching every corner of Snow Wind Continent.

Once again Snow Wind Continent was shocked.

Huang Xiaolong, who had been missing for three years, reappeared once again. This time, he actually killed seven Saint realm Deities Templar Elders in one go! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

When the news spread, the impact was no less than a heaven punishment falling down on Snow Wind Continent.

In Rising Sun City’s battle, Huang Xiaolong killed Deities Templar Elder Yao Fei, his name resounded throughout the Snow Wind Continent, whereas now, it was seven Saint realm experts! Seven Deities Templar Elders!

In the main streets and small alleys of Snow Wind Continent, everyone was talking about this.

Inside the Delicious Restaurant in Luo Tong Kingdom.

“All of you didn’t see the scene that day, Young Noble Divine Dragon just waved his hands, then sou, sou, sou! Deities Templar Elders fell one by one!” A certain family’s disciple recounted what happened to everyone around him, hands moving enthusiastically, spit flying everywhere, he was high-strung on excitement, as if those Deities Templar Elders were killed by him instead.

This particular family disciple was registering to try out for palace guard selection on that day and was fortunate enough to survive the battle’s shock waves. Pausing here, the disciple gulped down a cup of Snow Moon Wine. A sense of complacency sprung in his heart watching the surrounding crowd looking at him with anticipation.

“What happened after that?” A person couldn’t resist urging.

“Afterwards, those Deities Templar Elders were pissed scared, how would they dare to fight anymore, all of them ran away with their tails between their legs!” This disciple ended it with boisterous laughter, saliva flying everywhere, landing on the crowd’s faces and clothes.

“What about after that?” The same person clamored.

“After that, it’s finished!” That disciple shrugged his shoulders in reply.

Scenes such as this one in Delicious Restaurant were replayed in many places throughout Snow Wind Continent’s kingdoms and empires.

“That Huang Xiaolong is able to control more than a ten thousand Poison Corpse Scarabs? Isn’t that too heaven-defying? He already has the God Binding Ring, and Absolute Soul Pearl, now he even has an army of ancient Poison Corpse Scarabs!”

“When Huang Xiaolong takes over the Asura’s Gate Sovereign position, fully controlling the Asura’s Gate, there will be a good show waiting for us when he goes against Deities Templar! Who knows which side will end up victorious!”

“Hard to say, Deities Templar’s strength is not something we can imagine. Moreover, there’s rumors saying that Deities Templar’s Temple Preceptor has broken through to the God Realm!”

Some were stunned, some gloating, some waited with anticipation at the incoming good show.

Of course, as the rumor mill churned, things reached new heights of exaggeration; some said that Huang Xiaolong had control over a million Poison Corpse Scarabs, and the numbers continued to grow, another rumor had Huang Xiaolong possessing millions of evil dragons.

Huang Xiaolong heard these ridiculously exaggerated rumors as he traveled past, and shook his head with a helpless smile.

However, those who used to think that Huang Xiaolong didn’t stand a chance against Deities Templar began to change their opinion, and no longer thought that Huang Xiaolong was merely an egg knocking on hard rock.

Leaving the Luo Tong Kingdom, Huang Xiaolong slowed down his speed, taking the time to practice as he journeyed to the Starcloud Continent.

Before this, he only managed to control ten of black ancient puppets on the third level altar of the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, so on this journey, Huang Xiaolong took the time to brand the remaining nine black puppets. Relying on his current level of spiritual force, Huang Xiaolong could already control all nineteen black puppets. Amongst these nineteen black puppets, the most powerful puppet was of late-Tenth Order Saint realm strength.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong placed two of the strongest black puppet at his side, he couldn’t let Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu or himself to act personally every time something happened. Two ancient Saint realm puppets were sufficient to resolve most problems.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong had opened the fourth and fifth layers of the Linglong Treasure Pagoda. On the fourth layer were actually countless pellets, most of them were grade ten, heaven grade, and there was also a large amount of divine grade. But they were low grade divine pellets and didn’t have much effect for Huang Xiaolong.

What truly amazed him were the mountains of spirit stones on the fifth layer of the Linglong Treasure Pagoda! Grade three, grade two, and piles of grade one spirit stones!

The grade three and two spirit stones weren’t of much use to him, but grade one spirit stones were a different matter altogether. The last time he was in the Dragon Tomb, to move the twelve crystal statues of the primordial divine dragons into the Godly Mt. Xumi, he had exhausted all of his grade one spirit stones as energy source for the Ten Buddha Formation. Grade one spirit stones were something that he greatly lacked.

After a quick scan using his spiritual force, the Linglong Treasure Pagoda fifth layer contained around three hundred pieces of grade one spirit stone, enough to last him a long period.

‘Too bad there are no heaven grade spirit stones.’ Huang Xiaolong lamented a little inwardly.

After he experienced using grade one spirit stones to activate the Ten Buddha Formation, Huang Xiaolong noticed that it couldn’t really display the formation’s full strength, if there were heaven grade spirits stones, he believed that the Ten Buddha Formation would be more powerful. Huang Xiaolong had a piece of heaven grade spirit stone but he had used it already.

After opening the fifth layer of the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, Huang Xiaolong wanted to open the sixth layer as well, only to find out that his current strength was insufficient to break the seal placed for the sixth layer, thus he could only put the matter aside for now.

Night blanketed the earth in quiet darkness.

Huang Xiaolong’s group of three stopped to rest in the wilderness, a small fire burning bright. Sitting close to the burning fire, Huang Xiaolong took out the Ghost King ring that he obtained from the Ghost King’s cultivation cave.

Under the fire’s glow, the ring glimmered with a dark violet light, the two evil dragons carving on the ring appeared nefarious and sinister.

These days, Huang Xiaolong had been searching the space inside the ring using his spiritual sense, but despite many attempts, he hadn’t yet found the legendary Ghost King Sutra.

Inside the Ghost King’s ring, other than those Ghost King Dans, there was only that blood ocean. All along, Huang Xiaolong’s intuition told him that the blood ocean was not so simple, it must be concealing some secret within its depths. He had tried various methods, but still failed to explore the bottom of the blood ocean.

Fiddling with the Ghost King ring for some time, Huang Xiaolong put it away once again, leaving the secret to be explored later.

“Sovereign, not far ahead is Blessed Buddha City, should we stay a little longer there?” Zhao Shu spoke.

Huang Xiaolong nodded somberly, “Yes, we’ll stay for a few days in the Blessed Buddha City.”

That year, if it weren’t because of the Blessed Buddha Token Shi Fantian gave him, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t have been able to enter the Blessed Buddha Cavern, and subsequently, he wouldn’t have been able to find the Godly Mt. Xumi. It was because he found the Godly Mt. Xumi that Huang Xiaolong’s strength rose at rapid speed, otherwise, not to mention breaking through to Saint realm, most likely he wouldn’t even be able to reach Xiantian Tenth Order.

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong had always felt indebted toward Shi Fantian. Since he was passing through, it was only polite to pay Shi Fantian a visit.

Thinking of Shi Fantian, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help remembering the conversation with Xie Puti about Snow Wind Continent’s number one beauty, Shi Xiaofei. Shi Xiaofei was Shi Fantian’s daughter.

‘I wonder if the Shi Xiaofei that Xie Puti mentioned is really as stunning as that guy claimed.’ Huang Xiaolong secretly laughed, it would be nice if Xie Puti was here now.

The darkness slowly receded as the morning light emerged on the horizon.

Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu got up, flying towards the Blessed Buddha City.
