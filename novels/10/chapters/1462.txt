Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s brutal response, the little cow clamored in anger, “Bratty Huang, how could you say that no one would want these old bones? Any part of my bones is good enough material to refine a top grade grandmist spiritual artifact!”

Han Tongfei’s face turned darker than the pot’s bottom as he saw Huang Xiaolong and the little cow squabbling among themselves, while completely ignoring his presence.

“Punk, are you Huang Xiaolong?” Han Tongfei went on icily, “We suspect that your subordinates are harboring escaped convicts. Since you’ve returned, you can take a trip with us.”

The moment Han Tongfei finished his words, Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared in a blur, and appeared right in front of him.

Han Tongfei was startled and leaned backwards due to reflex. He tried to say something but felt a sharp pain in his chest. In the next second, Han Tongfei realized that he was knocked backwards into the air, and he crashed on the street. He coughed violently as blood surged up to his throat.

Zhu Feng and the other disciples were stupefied on the spot, more so Zhu Feng. Zhu Feng turned and looked at Han Tongfei in disbelief.

Even though Han Tongfei’s strength was only so-so amongst the Fortune Emperor Palace’s inner sect disciples, he was still a peak early First Order God King Realm master. Yet Huang Xiaolong had knocked him backwards until he had coughed up blood, that too with one... just one punch!

Doesn’t that mean Huang Xiaolong is...?!

As this thought crossed Zhu Feng’s mind, his head jerked up as he turned towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Senior Brother Tongfei!” The other Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples reacted and hastened to Han Tongfei’s side. Everyone was in a fluster trying to rescue him with several chaos spiritual pills.

At the same time, they all glared at Huang Xiaolong and pointed their fingers at him.“Punk, you’re a new disciple of Fortune Emperor Palace! How dare you injure Senior Brother Tongfei? Senior Brother Tongfei is our Enforcement Hall Grand Elder’s grandson, you’re going to die miserably!”

“Kneel down and beg Senior Brother Tongfei for mercy!”

In the meantime, the injured Han Tongfei regained his focus under Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples’ rescue. There was astonishment, anger, and hatred in his eyes as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. With his identity, he was always used to getting what he wanted, but he was sent flying by a newbie disciple right now!

“No need to kneel!” Han Tongfei roared, his finger was trembling as he pointed at Huang Xiaolong in fury. “Firstly, abolish this bastard for me, then arrest him and take back to the Enforcement Hall. Use all the punishments there are to serve him, make him wish for death!”

The Enforcement Hall’s disciples rushed to capture Huang Xiaolong at Han Tongfei’s order.

These disciples’ strength was slightly higher than Han Tongfei, some being Second Order God King Realm, or even Third Order God King Realm masters.

However, these Enforcement Hall’s disciples were knocked back by Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, and the others before they could come close to Huang Xiaolong.

Han Tongfei was flabbergasted.

Although he had heard of Xiang Xun’s strength from Zhu Feng a while ago, it had not crossed his mind that Xu Baisheng and the other three were this strong as well. An outer sect disciple’s subordinates had actually dared to run rampant in Crimson Crescent City, attacking their Fortune Emperor Palace’s Enforcement Hall’s disciples!

This...!

Han Tongfei was still flabbergasted that he had not noticed Huang Xiaolong approaching.

A second later, Han Tongfei retreated apprehensively, and just as he opened his mouth to say something, his throat tightened, clutched under Huang Xiaolong’s hand. Huang Xiaolong’s stare was cold and sharp, so was his voice, “Though I don’t know what’s your relationship with Zhu Feng, or what Zhu Feng has told you, but you should have never come to me, looking for unnecessary trouble!” He paused briefly, then stated, “I loathe people who unnecessarily provoke and challenge me!”

Huang Xiaolong deliberately glanced at Zhu Feng.

That was enough to make Zhu Feng turn deathly pale, as he stood rooted on the spot instead of fleeing away.

Huang Xiaolong extended his hand and used his palm’s suction force to pull Zhu Feng into his grasp. He held him up by the neck like Han Tongfei. Zhu Feng felt his throat getting crushed and fear gripped his heart.

“Zhu Feng, frankly speaking, I don’t want to kill you considering that both of us are from the same branch.” Huang Xiaolong spoke as he watched Zhu Feng like he was a corpse, “What a pity!” He shook his head, but the coldness did not recede from his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong tightened his fingers around Zhu Feng’s throat, and crackling noises of breaking bones sounded loudly in everyone’s ears.

Zhu Feng struggled to speak but no words came out from his mouth.

“Don’t you worry, I will not kill you today.” Huang Xiaolong added coldly.

He had just entered the Fortune Emperor Palace, so he didn’t want to break the rules because of a small shrimp like Zhu Feng. Not to mention, he would get a lot of opportunities to kill Zhu Feng in the future.

Huang Xiaolong released his grip on Zhu Feng and Han Tongfei’s necks, flinging them to the side like garbage.

Zhu Feng fell to the ground first, and Han Tongfei crash landed on him. Screams reverberated in the street.

...

At this time, inside a residence somewhere within the Crimson Crescent City, the Enforcement Hall’s Grand Elder Han Liang was sitting cross-legged in the hall, enjoying several young women’ skillful massages.

Each of these young women had their own charm. Their attires were extremely revealing, and the semi-transparent cloths were only adding more enticement to the view underneath.

Han Liang’s hands were busy running around these young women’s soft bodies.

Several tens of millennia ago, he had obtained the ancient Enchantress Tribe’s yin-yang dual cultivation technique. During this time, his cultivation had risen significantly as he had cultivated with his several female partners.

Han Liang’s hands were roaming on these several young women’s bodies, when all of a sudden, he heard an Enforcement Hall’s disciple’s report from outside the hall, “Grand Elder Han, something bad has happened!”

Han Liang frowned at being disturbed. He had already ordered the disciples to leave him undisturbed except for extremely important things.

“Come in!” Han Liang ordered.

An Enforcement Hall disciple ran into the hall in a fluster and quickly arrived in front of Han Liang.

“What happened?” Han Liang asked impatiently.

“Grand Elder Han, Senior Brother Han Tongfei was heavily injured by another disciple just now... by a new outer sect disciple who has just entered the Fortune Emperor Palace. I came in to report since it’s an urgent matter.” The disciple quickly answered.

Han Liang blanked momentarily.

An outer sect disciple who has just entered the Fortune Emperor Palace, has heavily injured his grandson, Han Tongfei?

Han Liang’s face darkened as he ordered, “Lead me there.” If he, Han Liang, couldn’t handle a brat who had just entered the Fortune Emperor Palace, then what authority does he have left in the Enforcement Hall?

Han Liang and the Enforcement Hall’s disciple disappeared in a blur. In the next moment, both of them appeared in front of the Edge of the World Manor.

Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the others were just about to step inside the Edge of the World Manor when they saw two figures suddenly appear in the air. An overwhelming pressure spread out from Han Liang’s body, stagnating the surrounding airflow.

Even a Seventh Order God King Realm master such as Xiang Xun felt like there were ten thousand giant mountains pressing down on his body until he couldn’t move an inch.

Han Liang’s gaze fell on Han Tongfei, and his eyes turned colder upon seeing Han Tongfei’s miserable condition.

“Grandfather!” Han Tongfei cried out when he saw his Grandfather, as if he had seen the savior of the world. He struggled to his feet awkwardly and stumbled towards Han Liang as he whined, “If you had come a bit later, this punk would have killed me!” He pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong.

Han Liang looked at Huang Xiaolong full of murder intent. The overwhelming pressure from his body targeted Huang Xiaolong and suppressed him. Huang Xiaolong’s breath stifled, and even his soul felt as if it would shatter under the pressure.

Han Liang was a master who had surpassed the God King Realm; strong as Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique and soul force was at this point, neither could withstand Han Liang’s targeted pressure.

Right at this time, Han Tongfei shouted with his face distorted in a grim laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, so what if I came to you looking for unnecessary trouble? Let’s see, if you can do anything to me now?!”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
