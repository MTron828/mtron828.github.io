As the three figures broke out from underground, shattering the thick layers of ice, ice shards shot out in all directions.

“Who is it?!”Three people hollered furiously in the air.

Just as their words left their mouths, they saw the group of seventy-plus Ice Dragons. Their subsequent words were cut off upon sensing these seventy-plus Ice Dragons’ overwhelming momentum and their faces turned gloomy.

Being the infamous Demonic Skull Cult’s founders, even though the Three Skull Ancestors were confident of their peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm cultivation, they couldn’t control the fear rising in their chests.

“These, could these be the Ice Dragons?!” The one with a scar down his eyebrow in the middle blurted out in a quivering voice.

Not to mention, these seventy-plus Ice Dragons all had the strength of Ninth Order Emperor Realm and above!

There were more than thirty Tenth-Order Emperor Realm Ice Dragons!

And amongst them was one peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm!

Run!

This was the first thought that flashed through the Three Skulls Ancestors’ minds. Not one person hesitated, and all three made the quickest decision of using their most effective method of fleeing from the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield.

But just as this thought emerged in the Three Skulls Ancestors’ minds, the seventy-plus Ice Dragons opened their mouths and blew icy cold air. Frosty cold air turned into a violent tempest that froze the barren land and space all around, sealing their paths of escape.

The icy cold qi from one Ice Dragon was alarming enough, so one could imagine the terror of frigid cold qi from over seventy Ice Dragons. Under this heaven and earth, probably only the chilling coldness of Shi Ming’s Nine Yin Light could compare with the icy cold qi of seventy-plus Ice Dragons.

Even the black frigid qi of the Dragon Bear Valley felt a degree weaker compared to these seventy plus Ice Dragons’ combined icy cold qi.

The hundred million li space around the Three Skull Ancestors were blocked by layers and layers of thick ice-wall. The ice-walls’ icy cold qi could freeze many average late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts to their deaths and even freeze their souls!

It was not an exaggeration to say that even the soul inside a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor would be frozen into ice under this cold qi!

The Three Skull Ancestors stood where they were.

More accurately, they were imprisoned on the spot, without any opening to escape.

A layer of ice had formed over their legs and arms. Even the strands of their hair had turned into icy spikes.

In the next moment, devilish flames emerged from within their bodies as the three of them desperately spurred their godhead’s godforce. Their godforce continuously attacked the cold qi invading their bodies.

Their struggle went on for over ten seconds before the layer of ice enveloping their bodies began to crack.

The ice covering their arms and legs fell. Then the ice over their hair and body gradually melted, returning their freedom of movement.

Roar—!

The three of them roared simultaneously and attacked in synchronized movements. Terrifying toxic palm force akin to a poisonous dragon with overwhelming destructive power shattered the layers of thick ice-wall.

The Three Skull Ancestors succeeded in escaping from the ice prison.

The three of them barely emerged from behind the ice-prison when seventy-plus Ice Dragons had formed a big chaos formation and were waiting for them. In the blink of an eye, the Three Ancestors were surrounded once again.

This giant chaos formation was the Ice Dragons’ heritage Ice Dragon Formation. The higher the number of Ice Dragons forming the Ice Dragon Formation, the more powerful the formation was.

However, Huang Xiaolong was not in a hurry to order the Ice Dragons to attack the Three Skull Ancestors after encircling them.

“You three, hand over the Glaze Devil Stele.” Huang Xiaolong said flatly. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Three Skull Ancestors’ faces sank.

“Who are you?” The one inquiring Huang Xiaolong was the one in the middle. His expression was extremely sullen as he stated, “You have been trailing after us?”

They had utterly failed to discover Huang Xiaolong when he was following them.

“That’s right. I have been pursuing you from the Thousand Constellation Country,” Huang Xiaolong admitted and added, “I also know that you guys killed Tan Zhihui.”

This time, the man on the left seemed to think of something, and his eyes widened as he blurted out, “Aren’t you that young man who killed Huo Liucheng and fifteen other Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire’s Ancestors at the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range?!”

News about the reappearance of the long-lost Ice Dragons had spread through the Kingdom of Devil Beast not long ago. This news also consisted of shocking pieces of information about these ice dragons killing Huo Liucheng and more than a dozen Violet Python Empire’s Ancestors at the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range. Furthermore, these creatures had also defeated Chen Qin of the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire. Naturally, the Three Skull Ancestors had heard the news. Moreover, rumors were saying that the person owning these three Ice Dragons was merely a peak early Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm young man.

The young man in front of them had the cultivation of a peak early Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, and he had followed them from the Thousand Constellation Country.

Therefore, it was not hard to deduce that Huang Xiaolong was the young man at the center of these rumors.

The problem was, the number of Ice Dragons this young man had was more than three, unlike the rumors claimed. Instead, there were more than seventy Ice Dragons!

There were more than seventy Ice Dragons!

The three of them could imagine what kind of storm it would raise outside if this truth were to spread out.

Still, they could not figure out how a Heavenly Monarch Realm young man had managed to tame so many Ninth Order and Tenth Order Emperor Realm Ice Dragons.

“Correct! I am the same young man from the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range.” Huang Xiaolong admitted casually. “I’m giving the three of you ten seconds to hand over the Glaze Devil Stele.”

The Three Skulls Ancestors’ faces tightened with nervousness and surging anger.

“If we hand over the Glaze Devil Stele to you, you’re going to let us leave?” The man in the middle asked sullenly.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “If you hand over the Glaze Devil Stele, you also must make an oath to the heavens to recognize me as your master. I will let you leave after that.”

Their faces were even more sullen, and hesitation flickered back and forth in their eyes. They started to discuss between themselves through voice transmission whether they should make a run for it or think of a way to kill Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop the three from discussing through voice transmission.

“Ten!” “Nine!” “Eight!”

Lu Xiaoqing counted loudly.

Seconds passed by, and soon, Lu Xiaoqing counted down to ‘four,’ then ‘three...’

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over the three men.

If the three of them didn’t hand over the Glaze Devil Stele to him by the deadline or attempt to run away, Huang Xiaolong would give the order to kill them.

“Two!”

“One!”

When Lu Xiaoqing’s countdown reached ‘one,’ killing intent erupted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“Fine, we’ll give you the Glaze Devil Stele.” Suddenly, the man in the middle spoke. “We can take the oath to serve you, but we will only serve you for a million years.”

Through their voice transmission discussion, admittedly, there was no way to escape. In the end, they could only surrender.

“And before we make any oath, we want to know who you are?” The one on the right added.

The three of them were curious about Huang Xiaolong’s identity. If they didn’t even know who Huang Xiaolong was, then it would be hard for them to serve him willingly.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement. In the next moment, his facial features changed, reverting to his original face. At the same time, the four odd beasts, fourteen Radiance Angels, and one hundred Undead Netherguards all revealed themselves, standing behind Huang Xiaolong.

Looking at the four odd beats, Radiance Angels, and Undead Netherguards standing behind Huang Xiaolong in an orderly manner, a feeling of heavy pressure coming from them flabbergasted the Three Skulls Ancestors.

“You, you are His Majesty, the Nether King?!” The Three Skull Ancestors’ voice quivered as their gazes fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

If they still could not recognize Huang Xiaolong’s identity after seeing the four odd beasts and fourteen-winged Radiance Angels, they would be called the Three Skulls Ancestors in vain.

Various possibilities had crossed their minds, but none of them had imagined, nor had it ever occurred to them, that the peak early Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm young man could be Huang Xiaolong!
