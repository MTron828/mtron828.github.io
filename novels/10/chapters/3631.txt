Chapter 3632 – Unifying the Limitless Land

With the revelation of his grand cosmos energy, the experts of the two factions felt as though a formless pressure was pressing down against them from the heavens. Their auras were completely suppressed by an even more terrifying power!

When they were feeling despair, the Three Gods Halberd in Huang Xiaolong’s hand shot out towards them.

“Defend!”

Wu Xin roared in fright.

Ye Ye did the same and ordered for the members of the Ocean Race to raise their defenses.

Vortexes appeared around the bodies of those from the Limitless Celestial Empire and when they gathered together, they emitted a weird power that seemed to tear the space apart.

Waves gathered before the members of the Ocean Race and they eventually combined to form long blue dragons.

Rip!

Tearing through their defenses like it was nothing, the Three Gods Halberd continued on to its target.

Pillars of light emerged from the tip of the halberd and they were like arrows that shot towards every single enemy before him. Not a single one of them remained standing and Huang Xiaolong summoned the origin flames.

The four Universe Origin Fires turned into a giant ball of fire that clashed with the blue dragons summoned by the Ocean Race.

Boom!

They were sent tumbling away as the flames returned to Huang Xiaolong’s side.

“Universe Origin Fires!” Wu Xin and Ye Ye yelled in fright.

“Hurry up and surrender.” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

However, Wu Xin sneered in response, “Who would have thought that you would also possess the Universe Origin Fires? Even so, you can’t stop us from escaping! Once we leave this place, the news of your treasures will definitely reach the ends of the Unknown Space!”

“When that happens, the Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Zhu Chen, and the God of Death will look for you along with the masters of the other regions!” Ye Ye laughed. “What do you think will happen then?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Dumb*ss! You shouldn’t have showed off your treasures!”

After they spoke, they tried to leave the city. However, they were stopped by a barrier of light.

“Star… Star Dragon Divine Tree!” They stared at the roots that were slowly extending out from the cracks in space in disbelief.

“Yeah. I laid down the Star Dragon Divine Formation before entering the city. No one can leave the city.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “You will never be able to shatter the formation unless you manage to defeat me.”

The expressions of the two leaders turned extremely unsightly.

Huang Xiaolong started walking towards them..

…

A day later…

The experts of the two factions bowed respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong.

That included Ye Ye and Wu Xin.

Huang Xiaolong laid down restrictions in their dao sound before getting Wu Xin and Ye Ye to remove all their memories of the treasures they witnessed. Only when they were done did he remove the formation around the city.

Since he was done with the two factions, he got Ye Ye to search for the members of the Cao Family. In the span of a single afternoon, he led the experts of both factions over to surround the members of the Cao Family.

In the next few years, Huang Xiaolong used the power under his command to subdue every single ancient race and celestial empire in the Limitless Land.

When he was finally done, he controlled the entirety of the Limitless Land.

Due to his secretive actions when he subdued Ye Ye and Wu Xin, he didn’t alert any of the other supreme overlords.

According to the reports to the outside world, Ye Ye worked together with Wu Xin to completely dominate the Limitless Land.

Several years later, Huang Xiaolong entered the Universe Boat and he continued to cultivate.

Since the Limitless Land was unified, all the universe-level spiritual veins they collected were sent over to Huang Xiaolong as tribute.

The number of spiritual veins he gathered totaled more than eleven hundred!

There were more than 40 top-grade universe-level spiritual veins, and there were more than two hundred top-grade ones!

When he looked at them, Huang Xiaolong finally felt like he was a wealthy man.

Sitting in the first layer of formations on the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong threw several spiritual veins into the eye of the formation.

…

In the blink of an eye, two hundred thousand years passed.

Huang Xiaolong refined thirty top-grade universe-level spiritual veins in the years that passed and the grand cosmos energy in his body reached the 20.999 billion mark.

Another hundred thousand years passed…

Huang Xiaolong finally stopped cultivating and a frown appeared on his face. After so many years, he finally refined all the top-grade spiritual veins! Even so, he failed to enter the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm! No matter how hard he cultivated, he couldn’t cross the 21 billion mark!

It seemed as though he couldn’t enter the grand completion stage if he didn’t clear away the impurities in his body.

However, there was almost sixty percent of it left in him!

There was no way for him to get rid of it in a short amount of time!

The only good news was that he managed to open the second layer of formations. As long as he had enough universe source qi, he would be able to clear away all the impurities in the next million years.

Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Universe Boat and summoned the two leaders. After learning about the recent happenings in the Limitless Land, he returned to the Universe Boat to enter the second layer of formations.

Eight hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.

A burst of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body one fine day, and the sound of something shattering could be heard coming from his body. A terrifying storm was swept up with Huang Xiaolong at its core.
