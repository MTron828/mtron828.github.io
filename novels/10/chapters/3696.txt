Chapter 3697 – Offended Someone You Cannot Afford to Offend

“Oh? There’s a reward?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “What are you guys giving out as the reward?”

Mo Ren was slightly embarrassed and he sighed, “It’s a great reward to experts who are half step Universe Gods, but it’s nothing to someone like yourself.”

However, he still spoke of the reward. As long as one managed to comprehend the mysteries behind the mirror, they would be given twenty universe-level spiritual veins! They could also choose a single special art from the Ferocious Devil’s collection from before he became a supreme overlord.

That would mean that the techniques they would receive would be from when the Ferocious Devil had less than 20 billion units of combat strength.

Even though that was the case, it was still a priceless treasure. It was something experts in the Unknown Space dreamed of obtaining.

When Huang Xiaolong heard the rewards, he chuckled in amusement. “If I manage to discover the mysteries behind the mirror, you can’t take away the reward you promised.”

“Of course! If Lord manages to discover the mystery behind the mirror, we will give you the reward we promised! Even if you gave us ten times the courage, we won’t dare to do anything to it!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed as he continued onwards.

Even though there were a ton of people, they stepped aside when Huang Xiaolong passed.

That wasn’t because they recognized Mo Ren. Instead, a formless pressure around Huang Xiaolong pushed them away.

As Mo Ren rarely appeared outside, not many people managed to identify him. After all, not even the Dazzling Sun Princess could see him normally. Otherwise, the entire area would break out into an uproar.

They eventually arrived before the mirror.

The Nameless Devil Mirror stood in the air quietly. It was a five sided mirror, but it looked like it had eight sides. There were tons of runes inscribed around the mirror but they weren’t grand dao runes. No one could understand what they were.

It emitted a soft glow as it spun around in the air.

However, Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover the Wavering Light Prince standing nearby.

He was standing respectfully behind a middle-aged man, and streaks of light could be seen hovering above his head.

The Wavering Light Prince saw Huang Xiaolong, and after a short moment of hesitation, he spoke to the middle-aged man. “Dad, that’s the brat who crippled the experts of our race!”

When they finally saved the experts of the Wavering Light Devil Race, they discovered that they had all been crippled!

The middle-aged man was the patriarch of the race, Wu Fu.

Wu Fu’s head turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong as rage flashed through his eyes. “Oh? Is that the little b*stard who dared to cripple our men?!”

He might be the patriarch of the Wavering Light Devil Race, but their race wasn’t part of the peak-level races. He had no idea who Mo Ren was. Only the old ancestor of the race knew the second strongest expert in the Devil Capital Celestial Empire.

“That’s him!” Wu Fu waved his hand and spoke to the eminent elders behind him, “Bring him to me.”

One of the eminent elders replied respectfully before walking towards Huang Xiaolong.

The Devouring Devil naturally noticed everything that happened and a frown formed on his face.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sneer when he saw the eminent elder walking towards him. “When we came to your city yesterday, we ran into the Wavering Light Prince and the Heaven Secret Prince. They were fighting pretty intensely and they said some pretty nasty things when they ran into us.”

“The members of the Wavering Light Devil Race even wanted to beat us up.”

Huang Xiaolong might not have expressed his rage when he spoke about the incident, but Mo Ren felt his heart palpitating in his chest. The hidden meaning behind his words couldn’t be more clear in Mo Ren’s mind! The city wasn’t properly handled if people could mess around so openly!

If Huang Xiaolong were to look into the matter, the celestial empire was also at fault!

When he was still thinking about Huang Xiaolong’s words, the eminent elder of the Wavering Light Devil Race arrived. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and he growled, “Our patriarch wishes to see you.”

Huang Xiaolong stopped Mo Ren before he could say anything.

“Since your patriarch requested to meet me, he can crawl here himself. Tell him to kneel whenever he takes a step.”

The eminent elder stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Even though he wasn’t loud, everyone standing around heard what he said.

Wu Fu’s expression sank.

The eminent elder of the Wavering Light Devil Race frowned. “Brat, are you messing with me?! You’re looking to die!” After he spoke, his hands turned into claws that reached for Huang Xiaolong’s face. “I’ll tear your eyes off their sockets!”

It was too bad his hand was grabbed by someone else before it could arrive.

Mo Ren held the eminent elder’s shoulder and a trace of icy light flashed in his eyes. “If you wish to live, do as he says. In fact, you should listen to him if your race wishes to continue its bloodline. Right now, all of you can crawl over, including your patriarch! Kowtow till Lord Huang Xiaolong is satisfied!”

Mo Ren wasn't someone who wanted to watch the world burn. He had good intentions as he gave the Wavering Light Devil Race a way out.

However, the eminent elder sneered in their faces. “Who the f*ck do you think you are?! All of you b*stards deserve to die for humiliating my Wavering Light Devil Race!”

After he spoke, a punch came flying towards Mo Ren.

As a God of Creation at the small completion stage, his punch wasn’t weak.

Mo Ren’s expression turned cold and he slapped the eminent elder once.

In an instant, the man exploded into countless pieces. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Mo Ren’s combat strength might not have surpassed the 20 billion mark, but he was an existence comparable to the Yin Reversal King! How could the eminent elder survive a single slap from him?!

“What?!”

The experts standing around gasped in fright when they saw how easily the eminent elder was killed.

Wu Fu’s expression changed drastically.

Wu Fu was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, and he could see how terrifying Mo Ren’s strength was from the slap he gave the eminent elder!

He knew that Mo Ren was an existence who had reached the peak of the God of Creation Realm!

Staring at Mo Ren, he stuttered, “Who… Who are you?” He could see that Mo Ren wasn’t Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate, but he had no idea what their relationship was.

“That’s not important. All you need to know is that you offended someone you cannot afford to offend. If you kneel and apologize to Lord Huang Xiaolong right now, you might be able to save yourself.”

Lord Huang Xiaolong?!

He turned to look at the young man standing beside Mo Ren.
