Chapter 3255: Call Out the Person With the Highest Authority

Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Datou looked at the salesman angrily and stressed, “We’re here to buy a car. Is this the attitude you use towards your customers?!”

The salesman scoffed as if he had heard a very funny joke. “You’re here to buy a car? Do you have any idea about how much the cheapest model of BMW in our dealership costs? The cheapest model is at least ten thousand low-grade spirit stones! You won’t be able to afford it even if you two sell yourselves!”

Other sales staff snickered at the side as they watched.

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong took out a spatial bag and threw it onto the roof of a yellow off-road BMW. When the salesman saw this, he was enraged, but before he could reprimand Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong opened the spatial bag, and amazing spiritual energy rushed out.

Rich spiritual energy filled the dealership.

Everyone felt as if they were soaked in an ocean of spiritual energy.

The salesman froze on the spot, staring stupidly at the spatial bag. The saleswoman who had warned Huang Xiaolong earlier that he could only look but not touch was just as dazed in shock.

All the sales staff and customers who were looking at cars, whether or not they were planning to buy, were all staring dazedly at the opened spatial bag.

The space inside the spatial bag was stuffed to the brim with bright low-grade spirit stones!

“This is five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones. Is it enough to buy a car from your dealership?” Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over the salesman and saleswoman.

The salesman made a hundred and twenty percent effort to squeeze a stiff smile on his face. “S-Sir, enough, it’s enough!”

“Call out the most authoritative person in your dealership!” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “I want to buy many cars!”

The dealership’s most authoritative person!

The salesman had a bad feeling when he heard that, as if he could guess what Huang Xiaolong wanted to do. The smile of his face grew stiffer. “Sir, Sir, I am the dealership’s supervisor. What model is Sir interested in? I can introduce it to Sir!”

He bowed and smiled flatteringly.

Huang Xiaolong took out another spatial bag and threw it onto the same yellow off-road BMW. Similarly, Huang Xiaolong opened the spatial bag, filling the entire dealership building with rich spiritual energy.

“This is five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones, one million in total!” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “I want a BMW flying ship!”

“Are you authorized to take this order?”

“Call the person with the highest authority out!”

The transaction for a flying ship was handled by the dealership’s highest authority.

If this level of distinguished guests were neglected, the dealership’s top person would receive an earful of scolding if the headquarters learned about it.

The salesman broke out in a cold sweat, and in the end, he bowed low and said, “Sir, please wait here for a moment. I’ll go call our general manager over!”

The other sales staff hurried over to make sure Huang Xiaolong was comfortable, moving the beast skin sofa over to Huang Xiaolong, and then respectfully invited him to sit down. Someone went to take the dealership’s most expensive spiritual tea and brought two cups of freshly brewed spiritual tea for Huang Xiaolong and Huang Datou.

One person seized the chance to introduce various top models of cars and flying ships in the dealership to Huang Xiaolong.

Although flying ships were expensive, the lower range only cost four hundred to five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones.

Other customers each had their own thoughts watching the smartly dressed sales staff in a flurry around the plainly dressed Huang Xiaolong as if they were serving the Grand Emperor.

“This is unfair,” a disciple, who had mockingly called Huang Xiaolong a pauper, grumbled. “We’re also here to buy a car, so why is no one serving us spiritual tea?!”

The refreshing scent of spiritual tea permeated the dealership, and anyone could tell that this was a really good and high-quality spiritual tea.

The female disciple beside him looked at him in contempt. “You can afford to buy a light element car with a price tag of thousands of low-grade spirit stones. That’s the cheapest car in this dealership, so do you think people will serve you with spiritual tea?”

“If you can take out a million low-grade spirit stones to buy a flying ship, people will definitely serve you spiritual tea!”

The male disciple flushed with anger from her words, but he argued, “So what if he has one million low-grade spirit stones? You can tell it’s his father’s money. This kind of second-generation has a good life merely because they're lucky.”

The female disciple couldn’t be bothered to continue talking with him.

The salesman soon returned with the general manager. Not only the dealership’s general manager came, but all managerial personnel arrived with flushing faces and a thin film of sweat on their forehead, it made one wonder if the weather was too hot or they had sprinted over.

All of them had their best behavior while greeting Huang Xiaolong with utmost courtesy, and they introduced themselves to Huang Xiaolong before inquiring what he was interested in purchasing.

Huang Xiaolong pointed at the yellow off-road vehicle and asked, “Is this the latest and most expensive model you have?”

“Yes, yes,” the general manager hurriedly replied, and proceeded to introduce the vehicle’s features to Huang Xiaolong enthusiastically.

Huang Xiaolong asked how many colors the vehicle came in. He subsequently inquired about flying ships, telling the general manager to introduce several most expensive models of flying ships to him.

The few most expensive models of flying ships’ starting price was above one million low-grade spirit stones. Although Huang Xiaolong had merely put out one million low-grade stones in the open, the general manager did not dare to slight Huang Xiaolong at all. He was still very helpful and enthusiastic as he introduced three of the most expensive models of flying ships to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong asked Huang Datou what color he liked.

“Uncle, I, I want this kind of yellow,” Huang Datou answered shyly.

The off-road vehicle’s yellow was brighter than other yellow, more to a neon yellow.

“This off-road model, I want five, and this flying ship, I want two of them!” Huang Xiaolong said to the general manager. The models Huang Xiaolong had chosen were the most expensive ones in the dealership. He then took out six more spatial bags. All in all, there were four million low-grade spirit stones.

“But I have one request,” Huang Xiaolong suddenly said at the end.

The general manager, who was inwardly whooping with laughter at Huang Xiaolong’s order, was stunned, he professionally put on a smile as he asked, “Please tell me what request you have, Sir. Our dealership will strive our best to satisfy your requirements!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the bowing sales supervisor and said, “When I walked in earlier, they both said that the vehicles in your dealership can only be looked at, but I couldn’t touch. They were afraid I'd dirty the cars.”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s complain, the sales supervisor’s legs weakened, and he slumped to the floor with an ashen face. The saleswoman stood stiffly on the spot with her mind buzzing, and she did not hear what Huang Xiaolong said afterwards.

Huang Xiaolong bought five cars, one each for him, his father, mother, younger brother Huang Chenfei, and nephew Huang Datou!

The color Huang Xiaolong chose was blue.

His dragon soul used to be a blue dragon, so Huang Xiaolong has a soft spot for blue color.

As for the two flying ships Huang Xiaolong bought, one was white and the other was black. He was going to keep the black-colored flying ship for his own use, and the white one for his family. Unfortunately, there wasn’t a blue flying ship.

The sales supervisor and saleswoman were fired on the spot by the general manager, and he made a guarantee to Huang Xiaolong that no dealership would hire them in the future.
