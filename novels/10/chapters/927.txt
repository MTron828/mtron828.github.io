Stepping out from his manor for the first time in weeks, Huang Xiaolong asked a passerby for the direction of the weapon and armor trading market and headed there directly.

However, the result was disappointing. Although the Divine Dan City had a big trading market, the grades of weapons and armors available were simply too horrendous compared to the Xuanji and Hailstone Treasures.

Huang Xiaolong spent a long time searching, but only found twenty or so passable items.

Four hours later, he made his way out from the trading market. Seeing that it was still early, he decided to stroll around the Divine Dan City.

As time passed, the sky gradually darkened and Huang Xiaolong headed back to the Sun Moon Residence. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

On the way, on street not far from his Sun Moon Residence, Huang Xiaolong passed by a lively restaurant, causing his footsteps to halt. As if tempted, he turned and walked inside.

He had been in seclusion in the recent days, thus knew very little of the news going around in the Divine Dan City. The best places to hear the latest news were none other than restaurants like this where a lot of people gathered.

After entering, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept around, but his brows creased slightly after seeing just a few empty tables. He called for a passing waiter, tipped him a top saint grade spirit stone and told him to find him a good table.

A top saint grade spirit stone just for finding a good spot!

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s request, the waiter was shaking with excitement, close to hugging his thigh in happiness. With a beaming face and a blooming heart, the waiter led Huang Xiaolong to the second floor of the restaurant. Coincidentally, the customers sitting at a table next to the window were just leaving.

Taking his seat, Huang Xiaolong took out a top divine grade spirit stone and placed it on the table in plain sight then ordered the waiter to bring up the restaurant’s best dishes and the best wine.

The waiter bowed repeatedly, scurrying away as fast as he could to prepare his order.

About five minutes later, the waiter returned with a tray laden with dishes emitting a tantalizing fragrance as well as two jugs of Celestial Blossom Wine.

As the waiter placed the dishes on the table, he introduced Huang Xiaolong to the Celestial Blossom Wine, their restaurant’s signature drink made from several hundred kinds of spiritual flowers aged a hundred thousand years and above. Each jug cost two hundred thousand coins.

The waiter fawned, “Only people with exceptional bearing like yourself can afford to taste this kind of good wine.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled. With a flick of his finger, the top divine grade spirit stone on the table flew into the waiter’s hand: “You can keep the change.”

The waiter’s hands trembled as he caught the top divine grade spirit stone. For a second, it felt like his heart stopped beating. After what felt like a long time, the waiter shakily asked Huang Xiaolong if he meant it.

One top divine grade spirit stone was equivalent to eighty million ah!

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

The waiter suddenly gave Huang Xiaolong a kowtow then respectfully retreated. As the waiter walked away, the spring in his steps looked like he was walking on clouds.

After the waiter left, Huang Xiaolong opened one of the Celestial Blossom Wine jugs, causing a crisp floral fragrance to permeate the surrounding air, lingering for a long time. He then poured himself a bowl, gulping all in one go, immediately feeling a comfortable warm energy spread through his body. His pores opened as the fragrance of wine filled him.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone, this Celestial Blossom Wine tasted even better than the Heavenly Pill Wine he brewed himself, giving the drinker the illusion that they were right in a sea of flowers, forgetting all worldly troubles, their minds quiet and peaceful.

Huang Xiaolong started eating, occasionally taking a gulp or two Celestial Blossom Wine while listening to the conversations around him.

But, most of these disciples’ conversations were centered around his alchemist assessment a month ago. At one point, Huang Xiaolong nearly laughed out loud when he heard the way someone described the scene of him refining the Star Eclipse Heavenly Pills.

That person went on, “That Huang Xiaolong merely waved one hand and ten thousand divine fire dragons instantly flew out. In the blink of an eye, he melted the divine beast diagram, followed by a ten thousand zhang bright light, covering the entire Alchemist Grandmaster Union. Right at this time, several hundred top grade Star Eclipse Heavenly Pills appeared in front of everyone’s eyes!”

Huang Xiaolong remembered correctly that he had only condensed a single fire dragon, but from this disciple’s mouth it became ten thousand; not to mention the pill condensation light wasn’t as dramatic as that person described. Most importantly, his batch of Star Eclipse Heavenly Pills contained a little over twenty pills, definitely not several hundred of them.

“That Huang Xiaolong’s alchemy refining skills aren’t bad, but I say, compared to our Devil Son Mo Su, he’s still worse off.”

At this time, a black robed man interjected.

The surrounding people who were talking about Huang Xiaolong more or less idolized him. Hearing someone suddenly interjecting, moreover stating that Huang Xiaolong was worse than Devil Son Mo Su, they became upset. A few disciples were angered and about to snap at that black-robed man, but all of them held off noticing his robe.

An ancient devil clan disciple!

The surrounding cultivators’ expressions turned gloomy.

“What, are you dissatisfied?” That ancient devil clan disciple watched the several disciples’ black faces and sneered, “During his assessment, the technique that Huang Xiaolong used was the Hundred Divine Beast Diagram, but after that there is the Thousand Divine Beast Diagram that is a hundred times superior to it! Our Devil Son Mo Su’s Thousand Divine Beast Diagram has already reached the perfection stage.”

Thousand Beast Diagram!

All of a sudden, the restaurant’s second floor was pin-drop quiet.

Only the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s twelve Eminent Elders could perform the Thousand Beast Diagram, and some of them could merely perform the technique without really mastering it or reaching the perfection stage like Mo Su. Did this mean that Mo Su’s skills were even higher than the union’s Eminent Elders?

Seeing that his intimidation had succeeded, the ancient devil clan disciple continued complacently, “What, frightened now? Let me tell you lot frankly, the first place absolutely belongs to our Devil Son!’

Huang Xiaolong listened on with a calm face.

He didn’t expect that Mo Su to possess such a high talent in alchemy, achieving perfection stage in the Thousand Beast Diagram.

Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong spotted a familiar figure on the other end of the street. He was dazed briefly before jumping to his feet; his gaze swept over the street several times, but that figure disappeared. Not even his divine sense was able to detect it.

Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly, shaking his head. Had he imagined things? A sigh sounded in his heart; so many years had passed, had she been doing well all this time?

For a second time, the restaurant’s second floor was eerily quiet, everyone’s gazes were focused on the staircase. Feeling strange, Huang Xiaolong followed everyone’s gaze, the result slightly unexpected.

Devil Son Mo Su!

The person coming up the stair was none other than Mo Su.

Following behind him was the very same person who had a conflict with Huang Xiaolong some days back at the Union’s Chamber of Commerce, Jiang Lei!

Mo Su had never seen Huang Xiaolong before this. Jiang Lei, on the other hand, immediately saw Huang Xiaolong who was sitting close to the window almost immediately. He was stunned for a second, then snickered, pointing at him as he said to Mo Su, “Brother Mo Su, that brat is Huang Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong!

The quiet restaurant was noisy again, everyone slowly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief and shock.

At Jiang Lei’s words, Mo Su’s eyes narrowed, walking toward Huang Xiaolong’s table together with Jiang Lei.

Standing in front of Huang Xiaolong, Mo Su looked at him with a condescending gaze, “You are Huang Xiaolong? You really know how to enjoy yourself, still in the mood to drink wine. Or are you so confident that you’re going to win the first place in the upcoming preliminaries?”
