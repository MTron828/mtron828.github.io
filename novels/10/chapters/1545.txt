Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong exchanged another glance. Both saw their own delight mirrored in the other’s eyes.

This was the unexpected tree [1] that grew!

Who would have thought that this Dragon Mizzle Wine would be enriched with the grandmist aura!?

Even though the grandmist aura was very minimal, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong who cultivated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, instantly detected the grandmist aura’s presence in the wine!

Since this Dragon Mizzle Wine was enriched with grandmist aura, then...!

Loud gulping noises sounded from their table. After opening the jug of Dragon Mizzle Wine in his hand, Feng Yaozhong couldn’t wait to fill himself with several mouthfuls of the elixir then praised loudly, “Excellent, excellent wine!”

Xiang Xun, Gui Yi, and the rest also took a large gulp of the wine, then showed a look of appreciation.

In an instant, everyone’s breaths smelled of wine. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with tasting the wine at the moment. He urgently asked Feng Yaozhong, “Elder Brother Feng, you mentioned that this Dragon Mizzle Wine is fermented with a unique water collected from the dragon rain?”

“Correct ah.” Feng Yaozhong took another sip and smacked his lips before answering.

“Then, do you know where this dragon rain could be found?” It was Jiang Hong who asked the followup question.

“It’s at the Dragon Rain Mountains.” Feng Yaozhong answered. “You want to go to the Dragon Rain Mountains? But, the Dragon Rain Mountains are heavily guarded by our five Head Chieftains. Only those holding tokens given by any of five Head Chieftains are permitted to enter the territory. In truth, this Dragon Mizzle Wine is made by the five Head Chieftains’ subordinates, at the end of the day, the profits go to the five Head Chieftains.”

Inside this space, the dragon rain meant money.

Naturally, the tribe’s five Head Chieftains would want to control the source of wealth in their hands.

Listening to Feng Yaozhong say that the Dragon Rain Mountains were heavily guarded by the five Head Chieftains, neither Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong put it to heart. Even the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Mo Xiao was no match against one finger from Jiang Hong, what’s more to these five Head Chieftains who were at low-level and mid-level Emperor Realm strengths.

“The Dragon Rain Mountains, how far is it from here?” Huang Xiaolong asked another question.

It won’t be like the Land of Lightning Penalty, right?

“The Dragon Rain Mountains are very far from here. Calculating based on my fastest flying speed, it would take me two years.” Feng Yaozhong estimated. He wiped off the trickle of wine off the corner of his mouth as he grinned and said to Huang Xiaolong, “Brother Huang, I advise you against going to the Dragon Rain Mountains, as there are Heavenly Monarch Realm masters among those guarding the mountain range.”

Although he could not determine Jiang Hong, Xiang Xun, and the chaos black camel’s strength, he still advised Huang Xiaolong out of concern.

No one living in this space dared to defy the five Head Chieftains, and had guts to covet the Dragon Rain Mountain’s benefits.

There were a few times when outsiders had wanted to encroach on the Dragon Rain Mountains, but in the end, all of them had died a tragic death.

Huang Xiaolong kept a faint smile on his face as he continued to ask about the Dragon Rain Mountain’s location.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong were dead set on heading to the Dragon Rain Mountains, Feng Yaozhong could only tell them the exact location and other details he knew of.

Still, in the end, Feng Yaozhong couldn’t resist cautioning Huang Xiaolong again, “Brother Huang, heed my advice, you all better not go to the Dragon Rain Mountains.”

“Many thanks, Elder Brother Yaozhong, but we have to make a trip to the Dragon Rain Mountains.” Huang Xiaolong understood Feng Yaozhong was advising them out of kindness. He smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Elder Brother Yaozhong, we will return safely.”

“Take extra care then.” Feng Yaozhong sighed and nodded.

A sharp voice disturbed the table’s atmosphere at that moment, “Yo, look who’s here! Feng Yaozhong, what a rare customer. It’s not easy to see your face here in the Dragon Rain Restaurant!”

Huang Xiaolong and the others turned to look, seeing several figures swagger arrogantly towards their table. The one who had spoken was a sturdy-built middle-aged man. Feng Yaozhong had a burly stature but this middle-aged man was burlier than Feng Yaozhong.

Feng Yaozhong’s brows furrowed deeply when he saw these people. “Feng Shiping, what are you doing here?”

The middle-aged man Feng Shiping chuckled loudly and said, “You didn’t open this Dragon Rain Restaurant, so you can come in here, why can’t I?” His gaze swept over Huang Xiaolong, Gui Yi, Feng Er, and the others as he spoke. His eyes lit up when he spotted the top grade-ten spirit stones on the table next to Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

“It really is grade-ten spirit stones! I thought that Feng Zhihai lied to me.” The burly middle-aged man Feng Shiping chuckled even more. “A few years back, that kid Feng Yuan came across several outsiders, slaughtered them and picked up several million grade-seven spirit stones and over ten thousand spiritual pills, finally, it’s my turn to get lucky!”

Feng Shiping and his group surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s table.

Feng Yaozhong jumped up from his seat in anger and bellowed, “Feng Shiping, get the f*ck out of here. Don’t think I won’t dare to beat you up because you’re Chieftain Feng Shili’s nephew. These people are my friends!”

At this point, the reason behind Feng Shiping’s visit was crystal clear.

Feng Shiping and his subordinates behind him erupted in laughter.

“Since you know that I’m Chieftain Feng Shili’s nephew, I advise you better not poke your nose into others’ affairs. Feng Yaozhong, for your big brother’s sake, I’ll let you go, but don’t think I don’t have the guts to cripple you!” Feng Shiping warned icily, and he pointed at Huang Xiaolong, “All of the spirit stones on this punk here are mine! Also that woman, I’m taking her!” His finger shifted to Feng Er.

Feng Yaozhong’s face darkened as fury erupted in his heart and he was about to attack when...

Huang Xiaolong extended his arm and stopped Feng Yaozhong. He was calm and indifferent as he said, “Elder Brother Yaozhong, we’ll deal with this.”

Feng Yaozhong looked at Huang Xiaolong and hesitated, but he nodded in the end.

Feng Shiping laughed even louder hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words. He widened his eyes and glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong, stressing the words between his teeth, “Punk, I don’t care who you are outside, but since you’re here, I suggest that you don’t do something foolish like resisting. Obedience will ensure you live a few years longer, then die comfortably. If you dare to resist, you will die today, miserably and tragically!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong said indifferently.

“I’m sure you all have noticed in this space, you won’t be able to live long, there’s no use keeping your spirit stones, spiritual pills and what not with you, better hand them out to me, and you can still struggle to live a few years.” Feng Shiping snickered with satisfaction at his own words.

Precisely at this time, the chaos black camel’s eyes glimmered with a touch of crimson. In the next second, Feng Shiping and his subordinates were struck by rays of crimson light, tumbling into various corners of the restaurant.

Feng Shiping and a few others were directly swept out from the restaurant, onto the streets, and they no longer moved. No one dared to check if Feng Shiping was still breathing.

Other Barbarians who had been waiting to watch a good show were stupefied. Many of them knew Feng Shiping, and knew that Feng Shiping was an Eighth Order God King Realm master, and those few subordinates were not weak as well, their strengths averaging Seventh Order God King Realm. In this city, these people were considered as elite experts. Who would have thought that in a split second, they would be sent flying by some crimson lights from that black camel’s eyes?!

Even Feng Yaozhong was flabbergasted.

Feng Yaozhong smiled wryly as he watched Huang Xiaolong, sighing, “Brother Huang, you guys have provoked troubles now. That Feng Shiping is our Chieftain Feng Shili’s nephew. You guys have to leave this place immediately.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled reasssuringly at Feng Yaozhong instead, and said, “It’ll be fine.”

Now that they had learned there might be a source of grandmist aura in the Dragon Rain Mountains, Huang Xiaolong decided to set off in a little while, and told Jiang Hong his decision. Jiang Hong had no objection, he too wanted to investigate the Dragon Rain Mountains as soon as possible.

Of course, all that had to wait until they filled their bellies.
