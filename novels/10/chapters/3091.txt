Chapter 3092: What an Arrogant Kid!

In fact, Huang Xiaolong had used the chance when the Myriad Formation Devil was underestimating him to lay down the formation. Lei Yu and the others had managed to distract him enough so that Huang Xiaolong could lay down the formation undetected. Otherwise, with the old devil’s experience, he would have noticed Huang Xiaolong’s sneaky movements as soon as he made them.

Upon waving his hand once, multiple suns and moons started to appear in the skies above them.

By supporting the Sun Moon Furnace in one hand, it became the eye of the formation as rays of light pierced into the surroundings.

As beams of golden sunlight and silvery moonlight intertwined, a beautiful picture was painted in the skies.

As the old devil’s eyes flashed, he peered through the void, and his gaze landed on the furnace in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

The Sun Moon Grand Formation might have been the strongest defensive formation in the Divine Tuo Holy World, but it didn’t amount to much in the eyes of the Myriad Formation Devil.

He was someone who was well versed in the dao of formations!

In the Origin Holy World, if he claimed to be the second best in the dao of formations, no one would dare to claim to be the best!

Huang Xiaolong stared at him with indifference and explained, “Indeed, it might not be able to trap you here forever, but stopping you for an hour would suffice.”

In the past, the Sun Moon Grand Formation would have never been able to stop the old devil for an hour. However, when it evolved into a peak-grade cosmos artifact, it was more than capable of doing so, especially with Huang Xiaolong’s help.

When the old devil heard that all Huang Xiaolong wanted to do was to trap him for an hour, he was taken aback.

What could Huang Xiaolong do to him in one short hour?

Snorting coldly, the Myriad Formation Devil filled the skies with clones. God knew how many hundreds of millions he summoned, but all of them had the strength of a formidable expert!

“Break!” Yelling angrily, he sent multiple punches towards the furnace in Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong moved the same moment he did. His entire body turned light blue in color as icy qi filled the skies.

As a snowstorm kicked up, the power of poison filled the space they were in. Bolts of lightning appeared from the void and a buzzing sound entered the ears of everyone present.

When the two finally exchanged blows, the space around them started to crumble. Stars started to shatter when they were struck by the shockwaves.

Even with the lightning qi protecting them on the Purple Lightning Peak, Feng Yuxuan and the others felt the blood in their bodies flowing in reverse.

“Is this his true strength?” Feng Yuxuan gasped in horror.

She thought that Huang Xiaolong had already used everything he had when he had beaten back the old devil previously. She didn’t think that he could also use the power of absolute lightning!

“Five… Five types of elements!”

Complex emotions filled her heart.

Huang Xiaolong had first showcased his control over the power of absolute balze, and then the power of nirvana. When he had pushed the old devil back, he showed off the power of absolute frost and poison at perfection level! Now, he brought out the power of absolute lightning!

“Even the World Master might not be a match for him…” She thought to herself.

The world master might have reached the grand completion stage in four different types of energies, but she didn’t think he would be able to go up against Huang Xiaolong!

She couldn’t help but question Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

When she was still stuck in her thoughts, a horrifying wave of energy swept towards the mountain peak. She was sent crashing to the ground along with her maidservants, and she fainted shortly after.

As soon as she lost consciousness, twelve Saint Fates emerged in the space above the mountain. The cosmos energy of three worlds appeared, and the old devil felt the space around them turning a lot more solid. He saw a golden dragon materializing behind Huang Xiaolong and it was as though a bomb went off in his brain.

The golden dragon emitted a kingly aura, and when it appeared, it became the only ruler of the world.

“God… God of Creation, Huang Long!”

The Myriad Formation Devil screamed in shock, but it was too bad Feng Yuxuan and her maidservants were unable to hear him.

…

No one knew how long had passed, but the ladies slowly opened their eyes.

A handsome face appeared before her and the domineering aura he emitted caused her to jump. Getting to her feet, she couldn’t help but fall to her knees. “Your Highness!”

Her maidservants, who were barely awake, quickly mirrored her actions.

The exchange between Huang Xiaolong and the Myriad Formation Devil shocked all of them.

When Huang Xiaolong heard what they said, he couldn’t help but chuckle softly, “Get up.”

They only got to their feet after hearing what he said.

Looking around, they saw another old man standing behind Huang Xiaolong. The new member was massive, and Feng Yuxuan couldn’t help but wonder where he came from. After all, Huang Xiaolong only had thirteen servants and Lei Yu beside him, when he traveled around the Origin Holy World. She didn’t know when he had managed to subdue another expert. When she looked into the eyes of the well-built old man standing behind Huang Xiaolong, she was terrified by the dark light that swirled within. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Your Highness, did the Myriad Formation Devil escape?” Feng Yuxuan couldn’t help but ask.

Exchanging looks, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu snickered. The only person who revealed a weird expression was the well-built old man behind Huang Xiaolong.

“You’ll see.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

With question marks popping up in her mind, Feng Yuxuan didn’t intend to press the issue despite her confusion.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the headquarters of the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce. As soon as he arrived, he entered one of the secret rooms to refine the Liquid of Life and Dazzling Gold Stone he had purchased. He wanted to comprehend the power of absolute wood and gold as quickly as he could.

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong arrived, Marshal Jiang Meng from the World Master’s Manor arrived to look for him.

“Marshal Jiang Meng?” Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. “I’ll be there shortly.”

In the main hall of the chamber of commerce, a group of experts from the World Master’s Manor chatted with each other. They were led by a man who had a squarish face and a domineering aura.

There were four great marshals in the World Master’s Manor, and Yang Yuyuan was the strongest among them. As for Jiang Meng, his authority was only superseded by Yang Yuyuan, and he could be considered quite a figure in the World Master’s Manor. He was ranked fortieth on the Extermination List, and his strength was comparable to the Origin Prince, Xiao Yuncheng.

Several moments later, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable emerged from the inner hall and made a report, “Marshal Jiang Meng, please hold on a moment, His Highness will be here soon.”

Several commanders behind Jiang Meng frowned. “Huang Xiaolong is really an arrogant b*stard! How dare he make Lord Jiang wait for him?!”
