“Yes, Master!” Ancestor Shi Yihai complied with utmost respect, then arranged his tribe’s Grand Elders to clean up the battlefield.

Some time later, a group of Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Grand Elders handed up all the spatial rings they had collected from the battlefield.

Every person in the Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion had a spatial ring.

Not to mention that this Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion consisted of their elite disciples, thus, inside every spatial ring was a startling amount of spirit stones and spiritual herbs.

Huang Xiaolong took the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Gao Yu, Zhang Xiaomeng, and the rest of the thirty-five Ancestors’ spatial rings. He gave the spatial rings that belonged to the Massacring Gods Gate’s Grand Elders, Elders, and disciples to Shi Yihai with the words, “The Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Ancestor God Realm disciples that participated in the battle will be rewarded one hundred thousand low grade-seven spirit stones. God King Realms and above will receive ten times higher the rewards. Heavenly Monarch Realm and above will receive one hundred times higher, and for Emperor Realms, the rewards will be one thousand times higher! Keep the rest into the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s treasury!”

The Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Ancestor Shi Yihai was overjoyed, and bowed low in gratitude, “Many thanks for Master’s rewards!”

“Many thanks for Master’s rewards!” All the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s disciples kneeled in thanks, their faces beaming with joy.

Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction. He then had all the entire Devil Scorpion Tribe swear by heavens dao to not leak out a single word of today’s event.

After all of the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s disciples and higher echelons had sworn to Huang Xiaolong’s order, Huang Xiaolong, Asura King Jin Yuan, and the others headed to the main hall with Ancestor Shi Yihai, Patriarch Shi Tong, and the remaining Eminent Elders following behind them.

Back in the main hall, the Demon King Fan Hui spoke first, “Cool! It has been a while since I feel so refreshed! The Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion was totally annihilated, it’s simply satisfying!”

In recent years, the Massacring Gods Gate had become increasingly rampant, not showing the slightest respect to the Netherworld King’s Organisation. Hence, Fan Hui and the others had long wanted to teach the Massacring Gods Gate a lesson.

Tai Yue laughed in his sonorous voice and said, “Thirty-five Emperor Realm Ancestors ah, this time, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor must be going crazy right now. I believe after hearing this result, the Massacring Gods Gate should behave for sometime!”

Thirty-five Emperor Realm Ancestors!

Even the Netherworld King’s Organisation would feel a stabbing pain in their hearts if they lost thirty-five Emperor Realm experts.

“If it’s up to me, I say we should gather up our own army, and kill all the way to the Massacring Gods Gate headquarters, those sons of b*tches!” Wan Yutian clamored spunkily.

Jin Yuan laughed, “The Holy Mountain is about to appear, and Master still needs to hurry over. Where has he got the time for that.”

Wan Yutian chuckled sheepishly. He was aware of that and was merely jesting. The Massacring Gods Gate headquarters was not so easy to attack. With the Massacring Gods Gate’s current foundation, even someone who had surpassed the Emperor Realm and possessed a grandmist treasure would have a hard time taking down the Massacring Gods Gate headquarters.

It was just like them, the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s Ten Great Commanders, if all ten of them were to join hands to form a formation, they would not be afraid of an enemy that had surpassed the Emperor Realm.

“Master, should we deactivate the defensive grand formation now?” A while later, Shi Yihai inquired with Huang Xiaolong’s opinion.

“Deactivate it.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and permitted.

Now that they had dealt with the Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion, the grand formation was done with its role this time.

“Yes, Master.” Shi Yihai respectfully complied.

At this time, a large crowd of Mohe Plane’s experts had gathered outside the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s defensive grand formation.

The Massacring Gods Gate’s army planning to attack the Devil Scorpion Tribe was a big event on the Mohe Plane, even in the whole Asura World. So naturally, there were experts from various forces who had gathered to witness it.

“It’s already been four days, what’s the situation inside?” A Withered Bones Sect’s expert muttered as he stared at the defensive grand formation with bright burning eyes.

This was a low-level Emperor Realm Ancestor from the seventh ranked Withered Bones Sect.

As everyone’s sight was hindered by the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s grand formation, no one could see what was going on inside.

“There is no movement inside even after four days... Is the Devil Scorpion Tribe completely annihilated by the Massacring Gods Gate’s army?” An old man clad in glaring bloodred battle armor voiced his doubt aloud. On his bloodred battle armor was the insignia of a blood sea. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Avīci Sea Cult’s Ancestor!

The Avīci Sea Cult ranked higher than the Withered Bones Sect amongst Asura World’s super forces at fifth place!

“The Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one consists of high-level Ancestor God Realm cultivators and above, most of them are God King Realm experts, a hundred thousand Heavenly Monarchs, and thirty-five Emperors. This degree of firepower is more than enough to destroy the whole Devil Scorpion Tribe, but why would the Devil Scorpion Tribe open the grand formation and allow the Massacring Gods Gate’s army inside knowing full well that they were no match? Again, why would the Devil Scorpion Tribe close the grand formation after the Massacring Gods Gate’s army went in, cutting off their own escape route?” An Absolute Yin Hall’s Hall Master spoke, unable to figure it out.

The Absolute Yin Hall was one of the Asura World’s top ten super forces, ranked eighth.

While the various forces’ experts who were gathered outside whispered in low voices, suddenly, the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s grand formation in front of them glimmered, then vanished before their eyes.

Seeing the suddenly deactivated grand formation, everyone outside exchanged baffle glances.

Inside, the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s disciples were patrolling as usual, however, the Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion was nowhere to be seen!

This...? What the heck is going on?

Looking at this strange sight, none of the various forces’ experts who were gathered outside dared to step inside to check the situation.

It didn’t take long for the news of Massacring Gods Gate’s army’s annihilation to spread to every corner of Mohe Plan and the Asura World like wildfire.

The Mohe Plane was in absolute furor!

The entire Asura World was shaken!

“Impossible! Absolutely impossible! All thirty-five of the Massacring Gods Gate’s thirty-five Emperor Realm Ancestors were killed? Not even one escaped? This must be a rumor!”

Hearing this news, most people shook their heads in disbelief.

But soon, another news spread. The Massacring Gods Gate’s Chief was infuriated because Gao Yu, Zhang Xiaomeng, and the others’ soul tokens were found shattered!

“The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Gao Yu and Ancestor Zhang Xiaomeng are really dead?! Died at the hands of the Devil Scorpion Tribe?! But the Devil Scorpion Tribe does not have this strength. Could the Netherworld King’s Organisation have interfered?”

While the consecutive news shocked various forces’ experts, they wondered if the Netherworld King’s Organisation had made a move in secret. But soon, after these forces’ covert investigations, it was found that the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s Senior Commanders and Junior Commanders were all in their respective territories, hence it was impossible for them to appear on Mohe Plane.

Then again, if the Netherworld King’s Organisation did not make a move, who has the power to annihilate the Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion?!!

“It is said that the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor was absolutely infuriated, and he has declared that he would personally make a trip to attack the Devil Scorpion Tribe once the Holy Mountain’s matter ends. Anyone that dares to lend help to the Devil Scorpion Tribe will be destroyed by the Old Ancestor!”

“The Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion was annihilated just like that. The Massacring Gods Gate definitely cannot swallow this. If they don’t make the Devil Scorpion Tribe payback in blood, how are the Massacring Gods Gate going to unify the Asura World?”

Various versions of rumors spread through Mohe Plane.

When some of these rumors reached Huang Xiaolong’s ears, he let it go with a smile. It may be true that the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor wants to lead another army to attack the Devil Scorpion Tribe, then again, what do they have to worry about with one hundred high-level puppet Netherguards?

In his opinion, it would be even better if the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor came personally! His City of Eternity required a large amount of Heavenly Monarch Realm and Emperor Realm experts’ blood essence and divine qi to temper!

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong left the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Green Flame Mountain Range with Tai Yue, and the other three, in the direction of the Asura Gate headquarters.
