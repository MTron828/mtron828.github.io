Chapter 2600: Long Peng and Feng Jiu

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong heard a lot of similar discussions.

In the Holy World, the Holy Heavens didn’t care about when disciples tried to enter the organization. It was the reason why everyone could choose to take the test when they were ready. However, the Otherworldly Mansion was different. There was only a certain period of time they were willing to accept disciples.

A hundred thousand years ago, the Otherworldly Mansion had only accepted a batch of disciples every hundred years. However, the great battle between the Alien Lands and the Holy World was looming, therefore, they had quickly changed their rules. Now, the selection would take place every ten years.

In the past, even disciples with saint godheads ranked in the top hundred had chances to fail to enter the mansion! They had to pass through a series of tests! But right now, they accepted anyone whose saint godhead ranked in the top one hundred!

One could easily see that their standards had been lowered.

Of course, even True Saint Realm experts could apply to enter the mansion.

As soon as they passed the test, True Saints would receive better treatment than disciples in the Venerable or half-True Saint Realm no matter how talented they were.

After staying in the Ice Lightning Holy Grounds for two more days, Huang Xiaolong continued on his way towards the heart of the Otherworldly Mansion. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As soon as he entered, he went straight towards the main hall.

The main hall of the Otherworldly Mansion was humongous, and it was as large as the Cangqiong Holy Grounds if he really wanted to compare sizes. When he arrived, giant flying ships hung high in the skies. There were more than a hundred of them, and all of them were surprisingly saint artifacts!

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath when he thought about it. Could they all belong to the Otherworldly Mansion? After all, the insignia of the mansion was carved into the body of every ship.

It was impossible to make a fake insignia as one needed a special method developed by the Otherworldly Mansion in order to create the insignia.

Turning his attention away from the holy ships, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the Otherworldly Mansion was bustling with much more activity compared to the Holy Heavens. Since they only accepted disciples once every ten years, it made sense.

He saw members of all races streaming about, and there were some who rode on True Saint Realm mounts, and there were also some who rode in carriages. There were also a scant few who flew through the air on flying swords.

After half a day of observation, Huang Xiaolong noticed many Seventh Heaven True Saints, and there were several Eighth Heaven True Saints as well. The only ones who failed to turn up were Ninth Heaven True Saints.

It didn’t matter if he was in the Holy World or the Alien Lands, Ninth Heaven True Saints were rare existences.

He also noticed that there were a very few humans running about. Even if there were, they would be following behind the experts of the Alien Race.

As the only human standing beside a jet-black figure, Huang Xiaolong stood out like a sore thumb.

“I’ve heard that Longpeng of the Flying Heaven Race is planning to take part in the selection!”

“What?! Longpeng?! Doesn’t he have a godhead ranked in the top ten?! I wonder if it’s real… If it’s true, the Flying Heaven Race might welcome its third Primal Ancestor in the future! I’m afraid that the Flying Heaven Race will no longer remain in its current spot!”

Longpeng of the Flying Heaven Race?!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled.

The strength of the Flying Heaven Race used to rank second among the royal races of the Alien Lands. However, ever since the disappearance of their first patriarch, they had fallen back into the top twenties. If Longpeng really managed to ascend into the Primal Ancestor Realm, the Flying Heaven Race could climb the ranks once again!

Even if they failed to regain their original spot, they would at the very least be ranked fifth.

“Longpeng isn’t the only one here! Feng Jiu of the Fiery Phoenix Race is here to register!”

“What?! Feng Jiu?!”

Another ripple swept through the crowd.

Everyone revealed an incredulous look when they heard the name, and it seemed as though Feng Jiu’s prestige in the Alien Race was even higher than Longpeng.

Huang Xiaolong frowned and noted down the name in his heart.&nbsp;Could Feng Jiu be more talented than Longpeng?

“I didn’t think that Feng Jiu would change his mind to enter the Otherworldly Mansion! In the future, he’s definitely going to be one of the candidates to take over the position of the Mansion Master!”

Even if one’s godhead ranked in the top ten, they weren’t guaranteed to become a candidate. However, everyone was sure that Feng Jiu could fight for a spot for the next Mansion Master! Huang Xiaolong finally felt a little curious about Feng Jiu’s origins. However, Zi Dongping hadn’t mentioned Feng Jiu when warning him about the obstacles he would face.

As he listened to more and more discussions along the street, Huang Xiaolong gained a little understanding of Feng Jiu.

From what he learned, Feng Jiu’s saint godheads could evolve!

He also had the Holy Mandate Imprint!

Of course, someone like that definitely had other cards up his sleeves.

This was the second time he had heard of someone possessing a Holy Mandate Imprint after entering the Alien Lands. The first was Yuan Qianxing, and the second was Feng Jiu!

“Feng Jiu…” Huang Xiaolong muttered the name under his breath and etched it into his mind.

According to various experts, Feng Jiu was in the Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm, and he was the second strongest individual in the Alien Lands in the younger generation! Even with his strength and achievement, the first place belonged to Yuan Qianxing!

Before Feng Jiu had entered the True Saint Realm, the Mansion Master had personally invited him into the Otherworldly Mansion. However, he was rejected. No one would think that Feng Jiu would change his mind after so many years.

“I heard that the human, Chen Muguang, is planning to register to enter the Mansion!” Someone spoke up all of a sudden.

“It seems like Chen Muguang is now the hope of the human race. No one knows if the rumors of him possessing the Fate Changing Saint Godhead is real!” Someone else sneered.

“B*ll f*cking sh*t! He’s a mere human! How much can he amount to?” Someone else laughed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head when he heard that the other party had the Fate Changing Saint Godhead. Even though it was ranked sixteen, it was pretty good for a human in the Alien Lands. Even some core disciples of the royal races wouldn’t be more talented than him!

In the past, Huang Xiaolong had inquired about the situation of the humans in the Alien Lands. The Chen Luo Sect was the largest power representing the human race! Their sect master, Chen Luo, was a Ninth Heaven True Saint!

Just as Huang Xiaolong was thinking about what his next step was, someone turned around and glared at him. “Brat, you’ve been following us for quite some time now! Do you believe that I’ll cripple you if you continue to follow behind us?”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly. It seemed as though the members of the alien race were too used to bullying humans. They could easily think of a reason to cripple a human’s cultivation.

“You’re the one blocking my way. As the saying goes, a good dog doesn’t stand in others’ way. Get lost right now before I cripple every single one of you.”

Eyes started to widen when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said. No human had ever dared to speak so arrogantly to them before!

In the past, humans wouldn’t dare to raise their heads even when experts of the alien race spat on them. Their legs would go soft when they received the slightest scare, but this time, they had met someone who didn’t play by the rules.

“Hahaha! Little b*stard, are you tired of living? How dare a human speak to me in this fashion? Don’t you know that we’re from the Seven Souls Race?!”

Seven Souls Race! They were one of the superpowers in the Alien Lands! Even though they weren’t at the level of a royal race, their bloodthirst and mysterious presence caused everyone to fear them!
