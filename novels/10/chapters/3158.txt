Chapter 3159: Finding Huang Shuai

A month later, the group arrived at the City of Nether.

“Your Highness’ Purple Lightning Peak’s speed is amazing!” As they sped through the vast space, Jin Xin praised the Purple Lightning Peak. He was genuinely awestruck by its speed.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “The Purple Lightning Peak’s speed is still too slow. I am planning to reforge it some time soon.”

In truth, Huang Xiaolong had long thought of doing that. In others’ eyes, the Purple Lightning Peak was fast, but the Purple Lightning Peak’s current speed was still a little slow for his taste. Therefore, after he had dealt with the Main Mystical Pavilion Master Huang Rong, and Huang Shuai, he was going to look for more genesis level materials to reforge the Purple Lightning Peak!

Jin Xin was speechless when he heard that Huang Xiaolong actually thought that the Purple Lightning Peak’s speed was slow, and he didn’t know how to respond.

When they reached the City of Nether, Huang Xiaolong’s group wasted no time at all in rushing to the Nether Grotto.

The entrance to the Nether Grotto was on the north side of the city, and it was tightly guarded by the City of Nether’s army. Every cultivator wanting to enter the Nether Grotto was to pay a certain amount of dao coins.

But Huang Xiaolong’s group was stopped at the entrance. Jin Xin was going to show himself, but Huang Xiaolong shook his head and paid the fees accordingly.

Jin Xin who had two layers of identities. One, as the Golden Spider Race Patriarch and the number one expert of Golden Spider Black Region, his appearance would naturally cause a commotion, and the news might reach Huang Rong’s ears sooner than they’d have liked.

Moreover, it was merely dao coins, and this was one thing that Huang Xiaolong does not lack.

The group went in without a fuss after payment was made.

One step into the Nether Grotto, and frigid coldness and darkness energy rushed towards them in more ways than one.

These waves of frigid coldness and darkness energy reminded Huang Xiaolong of the place Di Shuang had cultivated in the Black Frost Abyss. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, the frigid coldness and darkness energy here was much stronger than the Black Frost Abyss, and there was also a lingering nefarious devil qi here.

Huang Xiaolong’s group hurried on without stopping, and soon, they reached the second level of Nether Grotto’s entrance. The further down they descend, the stronger the darkness creatures and devils that attacked them became, and the surrounding gravity grew stronger as well. It took Huang Xiaolong’s group over three months to finally reach the ninth level of Nether Grotto.

The ninth level of the Nether Grotto was called the most dangerous place in the whole Golden Spider Black Region. It was so vast that it was seemingly boundless, and it was definitely bigger than several heavenly caves combined. Darkness devil energy roiled like an angry sea, yet it did not muffle the roars of the ferocious beasts that lived on this level. Here, even a high-level Dao Venerable expert would find every step taken taxing.

However, Huang Xiaolong noticed that there were actually many experts that ventured into the ninth level.

Jin Xin found it strange that there were so many experts on the ninth level. Normally, there won’t be so many experts coming down to the ninth level. After all, for many, the risks outweighed the probable gain on the ninth level as Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables losing their lives here was common.

“Did some kind of treasure appear on this level that attracted these people here?” The Myriad Formation Devil thought that was the likest guess.

Jin Xin nodded. “There is this possibility as there are occasions when genesis treasures appear on the ninth level of Nether Grotto, including the Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle.”

“Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle!” several people exclaimed in unison.

“Yes,” Jin Xin added, “Still, treasures like the Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle are rare, and it is hard to find one in a hundred million years.”

Right at this time, a group of demon experts flew past them, and it was needless to say that they were blocked by Huang Xiaolong’s group. Only then did Huang Xiaolong’s group learn the latest news in the last couple of months. It was said that the Glazed Soil had appeared.

“Glazed Soil!” The experts in Huang Xiaolong’s group exclaimed, and Huang Xiaolong himself was just as surprised.

The Glazed Soil was similar to the pure soil he had obtained across the Sea of Skulls, and it was capable of purifying one’s dao body and dao soul. Although the effects were slightly worse than pure soil, nonetheless, it was precious enough for experts to fight head to head for it.

“Daoist friends are not aware that Glazed Soil appeared here?” the group of demon experts asked in return as they were confused.

As Huang Xiaolong, Jin Xin, and the others had disguised their features with an illusion enchantment, none of the demon experts recognized them.

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “We’ve been hurrying on the road in the last few months, so no, we are not aware of it.”

“I see,” one of the demon experts responded and extended an invitation to Huang Xiaolong, even promising if they found any Glazed Soil, they would divide it in half.

Huang Xiaolong declined his invitation. Although Glazed Soil was precious, it wasn’t important to him. His purpose in descending the Nether Grotto was the Huang Long Heart, and the Huang Long Cape in Huang Shuai’s hands.

The demon expert did not insist after Huang Xiaolong declined his invitation, as he bid farewell and sped off with his group.

In order to locate Huang Rong and Huang Shuai, Huang Xiaolong unleashed the power of his Huang Long Bloodline to the limit. As long as the Huang Long Heart was in his vicinity, he could definitely sense it.

The ninth level of Nether Grotto turned lively with the unexpected surge of experts. One could see fightings and killings everywhere. Amidst battles against darkness beasts and devils, there were also fights that broke out from snatching for treasures.

Huang Xiaolong’s group turned a blind eye towards all these, as their main focus was locating Huang Rong’s group.

Two days later, there was a rumor circulating on the ninth level that someone had obtained Glazed Soil! But no one knew exactly who it was.

The ninth level shook when the news spread, and it led to even more experts rushing into the ninth level, searching for Glazed Soil as if they had lost their minds. Some demon experts even resorted to barricading space and capturing the passing by experts and directly searching their souls.

Huang Xiaolong’s group also encountered more than a few groups that tried to stop and question them.

These demon experts that tried to question Huang Xiaolong forcefully did not end up well. Even so, there were still a lot of people that came looking for trouble with them, that Huang Xiaolong had to have Lei Yu, Black Shadow Devil, Myriad Formation Devil, and others release their auras slightly. Only then did the endless disturbance stopped.

Five days later…

On this day, Huang Xiaolong’s group stopped above a swamp area. Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong’s Huang Long Bloodline throbbed.

After feeling momentarily dazed, elation rushed into Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

This absolutely is?!

“Your Highness, could it be?” Noticing Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Cang Xun couldn’t help asking.

Huang Xiaolong nodded heavily and inhaled deeply, “Everyone, proceed with caution!”

Everyone was ecstatic and complied respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong and the rest immediately converged their auras, and the group proceeded with high vigilance, following the direction in whicH he sensed the Huang Long Heart. After they had flown a short distance, the Myriad Formation Devil asked, “Your Highness, there’s a big formation right in front!”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered as he commented, “It should be laid out by the Mystical Pavilion’s people!”

Learning the Mystical Pavilion’s group was here, Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to rush in. He had the Myriad Formation Devil break the formation whilst he, Cang Xun, and the others arranged another formation over it. This way, Huang Rong, Huang Shuai and those with them wouldn’t be able to flee from this space.
