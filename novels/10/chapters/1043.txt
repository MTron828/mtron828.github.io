Fan Yuan’s head rolled on the ground near Chen Xiong, Wang Dafeng, and Zhu Wanchen’s feet, an expression of disbelief, unwillingness, and fear was frozen on his face.

Only then did blood spray out from Fan Yuan’s body, dying the ground around his feet red.

Chen Xiong’s, group paled, trembling uncontrollably due to fear.

Huang Xiaolong strode towards them without another glance at Fan Yuan’s corpse.

Chen Xiong’s pupils dilated in fear. He was shaking his head while moving backward at the same time, words jumbling in his head. Before he could open his mouth to beg for mercy, Huang Xiaolong’s black blade glinted, making a vertical cut from Chen Xiong’s head down to his crotch. A fine line of blood appeared and Chen Xiong’s body split into two.

Wang Dafeng and Zhu Wanchen shrieked shrilly, leaping away from Chen Xiong and turning to flee without hesitation. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, just as they turned around, a figure was already blocking their path.

“Hu-ang, Huan-g Xiaolo-ng, don’t kill me!” Wang Dafeng’s stammered, his words almost intelligible. He quickly added, “I pro-promise I won’t tell anyone what happened today, I beg you not to kill me, just don’t kill me!” Wang Dafeng pleaded again and again, on the verge of tears, “Whatever you want, I’ll give you, my uncle...”

However, before he could bring out his uncle to deter Huang Xiaolong, a cold glint flashed by and his voice halted. In the next second, just like Chen Xiong, Wang Dafeng’s body was split into halves by Huang Xiaolong’s Blades of Asura.

When Zhu Wanchen saw Chen Xiong Wang Dafeng being killed in front of him without any power to resist, he lost control and pissed himself.

A foul odor permeated the air.

No emotion could be seen from Huang Xiaolong’s expression as the black blades in his hands made another quick slash in the air, causing Zhu Wanchen to tumble backwards with blood spurting from his neck like a fountain.

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder to see the remaining Sky Dragon League and Great Whale Sect disciples escaping in different directions. Some even fled more than a dozen li away.

Huang Xiaolong snorted, pushing his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power to the maximum.

The surrounding air currents turned turbulent, causing the howling winds to seem like crashing waves in everyone’s ears. Those fleeing Sky Dragon League and Great Whale Sect disciples felt a sharp pain in their ears, and in the next second, they were being pulled back by an overwhelming force toward Huang Xiaolong.

This situation terrified those disciples to the extreme.

However, no matter how desperately they struggled, not a single one of them could break free from the unknown force.

In a matter of seconds, those Sky Dragon League and Great Whale Sect disciples were pulled back within several hundred meters from Huang Xiaolong, discovering that their blood essence and godforce were rapidly leaving their bodies. One after another, those disciples shrunk, turning into dried corpses.

Ten minutes later, all the remaining disciples had completely turned into dried corpses, tumbling down to the snow-covered ground.

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong collected all of their spatial rings, putting them into his Asura Ring. Subsequently, slashing out a Tears of Asura move, supreme fire element godforce fell from the air in a rain of flames, burning the corpses away.

Fan Yuan, Chen Xiong, Wang Dafeng, Zhu Wanchen, and several hundred Sky Dragon League and Great Whale Sect disciples’ corpses were all burned into gray ash, carried away by the wind.

When he was done, Huang Xiaolong finally checked the spatial rings he had collected.

What surprised him was the fact that Fan Yuan’s spatial ring contained many more Crimson Flame Beads than he had estimated, exceeding three thousand.

Adding the six hundred and twenty-three Crimson Flame Beads in his own spatial ring, Huang Xiaolong now had a total of three thousand nine hundred and fifty-one Crimson Flame Beads.

At this time outside the Ice Hail Ruins.

The Great Whale Sect Chief’s face was distorted with rage. In the last ten days, more than a thousand disciples had lost their lives!

Ten days!

In the past, during the three sects’ joint training, the Great Whale Sect’s loses were always kept under four to five hundred disciples, whereas now, in a short ten days, over a thousand people had fallen!

Moreover, most of them disciples had rank nine and above godheads!

‘I hope Fan Yuan won’t let me down this time.’ Wu Yue prayed to himself.

If Fan Yuan successfully won the first place in this time’s training, it would compensate the number of fallen disciples.

However, just as Wu Yue was thinking this, Grand Elder Chen Yihan flew up to him in a panic.

Watching him, Wu Yue frowned, extremely upset, “More disciple have died?”

During these ten days, Chen Yihan had reported to him more than a dozen times, and every time it was about more deaths of their Great Whale Sect disciples inside the Ice Hail Ruins.

Chen Yihan was greatly flustered as e spoke, “Sect Chief, just now, over two hundred and sixty life tokens of our Great Whale Sect have shattered!”

“What did you just say?! How many?” Wu Yue urged, “More than two hundred and sixty disciples?!”

In the past, the biggest loss they suffered at once was over a hundred disciples, but this time it was actually more than two hundred and sixty!

“Yes, yes!” Chen Yihan nodded, hesitating, “Also, also, amongst them are Wang Dafeng and Fan Yuan.”

Wang Dafeng, Fan Yuan!

Wu Yue’s head buzzed as if a giant thunderclap resounded in his mind.

The other Grand Elders present in the hall were shocked, their disbelief clearly written all over their faces.

Wang Dafeng and Fan Yuan had actually died!

What the hell was this? Fan Yuan was someone who could fight a mid-Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm. Inside the Ice Hail Ruins, there was basically nothing that could endanger his life, how could he die?!

A heart-wrenching scream came from Wu Yue, “Who was it? Who killed my nephew, who?!!” Overbearing killing intent filled the hall.

“Sect Chief, could it be the Elephant Genesis Sect’s Zhao Wuya?” A frightened Grand Elder spoke cautiously.

“Zhao Wuya!” A chilling light gleamed in Wuyue’s eyes.

At the same time, Gu Ling also received news of Chen Xiong and Zhu Wanchen’s death, as well as over two hundred Barbarian God Sect disciples, causing his expression to turn extremely ugly.

Suspicion and various conjectures filled the Barbarian God Sect compound.

Unfortunately, the people outside were unable to find out what happened inside the Ice Hail Ruins, hence, despite all of this, no one was able to confirm anything.

Inside one of the Barbarian God Sect’s cultivation dwellings, Chen Hao and several core disciples were discussing the upcoming Cao Family’s wedding in a few months when a Sky Dragon League member ran to his side, reporting, “League Leader, just now a message came from the Windless Mountain Range. Young master Chen Xiong, he... has fallen!”

“What did you say?!” Chen Hao jumped to his feet, the golden robe on his body fluttering in the windless hall, an icy golden light flickered in his eyes.

“Chen, y-young master Chen Xiong is dead!” That Sky Dragon League disciple ashen, repeating fearfully.

Chen Hao’s body swayed.

“Brother!!!” A heart-wrenching wail shook the hall.

...

Inside the Ice Hail Ruins, after taking care of Fan Yuan, Wang Dafeng, and the others, Huang Xiaolong headed straight to the cluster of Crimson Flame Beads inside this frost city.

After entering a large hall, he noticed that the Green Ice Hail Devils that were rushing at him actually stopped outside the hall, yet continued to issue low hostile snarls and growls. Even so, none of them dared to enter, as if they were afraid of something.

This situation stoked Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity.

But to him, it was a good thing these Green Ice Hails Devils did not rush into the hall, saving him some trouble.

Huang Xiaolong continued further into the hall, sensing the location of the Crimson Flame Beads.

After entering the back hall, he immediately spotted the hundred and fifty Crimson Flame Beads which were exuding a soft red glow.

But his attention was on the large frost coffin on the altar.
