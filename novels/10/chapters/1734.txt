The Corpse Soul Land was the biggest mainland within the Nine Yin Space, and the most precious in the entire Corpse Soul Land. This Corpse Soul Land generated the whole Nine Yin space’s rich and abundant corpse qi.

Shi Ming and Shi Wushuang’s purpose was to forge the grandmist treasure artifact, and the location was here on this Corpse Soul Land.

Huang Xiaolong did not converge his presence the entire way. He believed that Yang Ying would soon receive a report that he had reached the Corpse Soul Land.

In the air above the Corpse Soul Land, Huang Xiaolong opened his Eye of Hell and surveyed the land below.

Ei! Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked towards a mountain range in the north. His silhouette disappeared in a flicker and arrived above a mountain range more than a hundred thousand li away.

Somewhere on one of the cliff walls was a blooming tri-colored flower. Even though this flower had three colors, its colors were a little hard to describe. It was neither red, yellow, nor blue, and definitely not black or golden. These three colors seemed to incorporate all the colors in the universe and looked gorgeous and charming.

There was a rare excitement on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he stared at the tri-colored flower.

At this point, there were a few things that could make Huang Xiaolong excited. Whether it was grandmist spiritual herbs, top-grade grandmist spiritual pills, or chaos spiritual veins, these treasures didn’t excite Huang Xiaolong.

But when he saw this tri-colored flower, Huang Xiaolong was ecstatic.

Three Lives Flower!

The Three Lives Flower was Hell’s number one divine flower. It could even be called the number one divine flower between heaven and earth!

The Three Lives Flower’s three petals were divided into past, present, and future life!

According to the legends, one could gain an incredible ability to return to the past and cross to the future after consuming and absorbing the Three Lives Flower.

Of course, the legend may not be accurate, but this Three Lives Flower’s worth was equivalent to purple grandmist aura.

Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply. He arrived in front of the Three Lives Flower in one large stride.

Just as Huang Xiaolong reached out to pick the Three Lives Flowers, a loud exclamation sounded in the distance, "That’s a Three Lives Flower? It must be the Three Lives Flower, Hell’s number one divine flower!"

In the next second, a startling sword qi shot across the sky, straight at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong twisted his body away, and the sword qi slashed on the mountain peak some distance away. The mountain peak rumbled as it crumbled to the ground.

Ei! The attacker exclaimed in wonder seeing that Huang Xiaolong had easily dodged his sword qi.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the attacker and saw that it was one of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Hall Masters. Huang Xiaolong searched through Luo Haoming’s memories and learned the other side’s identity a moment later.

This Hall Master was called Yang Sihai, from the same family as Yang Jing. Yang Sihai had quite a high talent. Thus one of Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s high-level Emperor Realm Ancestors fancied Yang Shihai and had accepted Yang Sihai as his disciple-in-name.

Currently, Yang Sihai’s cultivation was at the early of Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. It hadn’t been long since he was promoted to the position of a Hall Master.

An idea came to Huang Xiaolong as he scrutinized Yang Sihai. He put on a cold expression and demanded, “Hall Master Yang, what is the meaning of this?”

Yang Sihai laughed heartily as he replied, “Meaning? You don’t understand? This Three Lives Flower is mine! Kill and rob, don’t tell me you have not done it before?”

Huang Xiaolong’s face darkened. “If you kill me, the Patriarch will investigate this matter. You won’t be able to shrug off the punishment at that time.”

Yang SihaI snickered nonchalantly in response, “That is not something you should worry about, as I will offer this Three Lives Flower to the Patriarch after killing you. The Patriarch won’t chastise me but will give me a heavy reward instead. What do you think?”

Yang Sihai was inwardly aware that as a mere Hall Master, the Three Lives Flower was not something he could keep for himself. On the other hand, if he offered it to Patriarch Shi Wushuang or Old Ancestor Shi Ming, the outcome would be entirely different.

The long sword in Yang Sihai’s hand slashed out in a sneak attack at Huang Xiaolong before he finished speaking. Sword qi burst out in a single slash, like an upside-down galaxial river rushing down.

“The Galaxial River Sword Qi!”

The Galaxial River Sword Qi was one of the more profound divine arts of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

Just as Yang Sihai thought that Huang Xiaolong would die on the spot, a blurry shadow disappeared. Huang Xiaolong passed through the heavy layers of sword qi, landing a punch on Yang Sihai’s chest, sending him smashing into the rocky cliff ten thousand li away.

Subsequently, the suction force from Huang Xiaolong’s palm pulled Yang Sihai back towards him.

“You, why, how, you...” Yang Sihai couldn’t be bothered with the blood flowing out of his mouth. His wide eyes stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief as he stammered.

Was Luo Haoming this strong?!

Luo Haoming was a late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch, yet he, an early Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch could not withstand one punch from him!

Not right! He had fought Luo Haoming in the past.

"You’re not Luo Haoming!" Yang Sihai blurted out.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and admitted, "You’re right; I am not Luo Haoming."

Yang Sihai was taken aback that Huang Xiaolong would admit it in such a straightforward manner. But then he laughed, “You actually dared to disguise as Luo Haoming to sneak into our Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe? You’re courting death. No matter who you are, you’re dead for certain!”

Huang Xiaolong replied nonchalantly, “You don’t need you to worry about that.” A purple light flashed as his words fell. A grandmist worm entered Yang Sihai’s body between his eyebrows, immediately taking control over Yang Sihai.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t kill Yang Sihai. He merely put Yang Sihai under his control to gain merit by reporting the Three Lives Flower to Shi Yinyu.

Huang Xiaolong told Yang Sihai Yang Jing and Shi Yinyu’s location. Then he had Yang Sihai ‘flee’ until he found a chance to report to Shi Yinyu.

After Yang Sihai respectfully complied, he disappeared from Huang Xiaolong’s line of sight.

Only then did Huang Xiaolong’s attention return to the Three Lives Flower. In one step, Huang Xiaolong stood in front of the Three Lives Flower and plucked it off the cliff together with the dirt around its root with extreme care.

Huang Xiaolong decided to put the Three Lives Flower inside the Heavenly Hall after some pondering.

Once that was taken care of, he continued to wander around at a leisurely pace.

Following Huang Xiaolong’s order, Yang Sihai pretended he was fleeing for his dear life and coincidentally ran into Shi Yinyu and Yang Jing. Under Shi Yinyu and Yang Jing’s questioning, Yang Sihai ‘honestly’ reported about the Three Lives Flower.

“What? Three Lives Flower? Are you talking about the Three Lives Flower!” Shi Yinyu and Yang Jing both exclaimed hearing ‘Three Lives Flower.’ Their faces shone with excitement.

“Yes, Young Lord, I am certain it is the Three Lives Flower. I saw it with my own eyes. When I, your subordinate, was about to pick it, who would’ve thought that Luo Haoming would ambush me from behind, injuring me. He actually has a low-grade grandmist artifact in his hand! This injured subordinate was no match against him and had no choice but to flee.” Yang Sihai recounted everything.

Shi Yinyu threw his back and let out a burst of loud maniacal laughter, “Good, very good, the Three Lives Flower, the Three Lives Flower, hahaha, really unexpected ah, this Nine Yin space actually gave birth to a Three Lives Flower. The legends say that the Buddha World’s Buddha obtained the first Three Lives Flower, and now, the second Three Lives Flower has appeared. Moreover, it’s right here inside our Nine Yin Space.”

Yang Jing too was bubbling with excitement, laughing shrilly. “This is good. I’ve wanted to clean up that Luo Haoming. This is a string of two happy events. But the Three Lives Flower involves a lot. Should we report this matter to the Patriarch?
