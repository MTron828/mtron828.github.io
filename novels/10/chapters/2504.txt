Chapter 2505: 50/50

“Thirteen, it’s you!” A lovely voice rang through the inner hall.

A chuckle escaped Huang Xiaolong’s lips when he discovered that the person standing before him was Lin Xiaoying.

Huang Xiaolong had thought that a Second Heaven True Saint would appear in the inner hall, but Lin Xiaoying’s appearance stunned him.

He was about to silence the person who entered the inner hall, but he held his hand. “Yeah, what a coincidence. I never thought I'd see you here.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiaoying widened her eyes. “How did you find this place? Wait. How did you enter the Burial Ground? Are you alone?!” She swept her gaze across the inner hall doubtfully.

This was the Burial Ground they were talking about, which is the most dangerous place in the Furtive Lands! How can a Fourth Tribulation half -True Saint enter?

Even Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints would die if they stepped into the Burial Ground. She had only managed to enter by hiding from the True Saint Realm ghost devils with a secret art from the Clear Snow Palace.

How did Huang Xiaolong enter the place?!

Huang Xiaolong stared at Lin Xiaoying with a helpless gaze, and he sighed, “I came in here alone.”

“Alone?!” Lin Xiaoying widened her eyes in disbelief.

“What’s so shocking about it? Didn’t you come alone?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Lin Xiaolong revealed a slightly haughty gaze when she looked at him. “Humph! How can you compare yourself to me? I’m a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint!”

“This isn’t a good place to talk. Let’s leave the inner hall before finishing this conversation,” After seeing as Lin Xiaoying wasn’t about to give up, Huang Xiaolong interrupted her and shifted the topic of conversation.

Lin Xiaoying nodded her head slowly and agreed, “Alright. Let’s talk about this when we leave.” The question marks in her head were endless and there were too many things she wanted to ask him.

She wanted to ask Huang Xiaolong about the way he had entered the Burial Ground and his ranking on the board.

Before they could leave, Lin Xiaoying saw the black ring on Huang Xiaolong’s hand and she screamed, “Black Corpse Holy Ring! You managed to obtain it?!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded sheepishly. “I got it by luck. Of all people, you should know how lucky I am.”

She was stunned, speechless with his reply. After all, she couldn’t deny the fact that he had heaven-defying luck. She had experienced it once in the Profound River, and she had managed to see how he had plucked holy herbs like cabbages at the side of the street.

Very quickly, they left the inner hall.

However, a figure shot towards them before they could leave the palace. Even though they couldn’t see the individual yet, waves of devil qi smashed into Lin Xiaoying’s tiny figure.

Those who could produce devil qi at this level could only be disciples from the Devil Palace!

“Xiaolong, run!” Lin Xiaoying didn’t think too much, and she screamed at him. “I’ll hold him off for now! Hurry up and get away!” She slapped the void before her, and a world of ice and snow formed outside the palace. The black corpse qi froze in the air.

This was the ultimate move of the disciples of the Clear Snow Palace.

It was too bad that her defense was shattered with a single flick from the other party. Then, the ice and snow in the air disappeared, and devil qi filled the skies.

As the blood drained from her face, Lin Xiaoying retreated repeatedly.

“Hehe, Lin Xiaoying, you might be able to forcefully deal with First Heaven True Saints with your Frozen Snow Heavenly Code, but you won’t be able to do a thing to me!” A cold sneer rang through the skies, and the figure descended from the skies.

Lin Xiaoying widened her eyes in shock.

Dou Rui!

The moment he arrived, he saw the Black Corpse Holy Ring on Huang Xiaolong’s hand. Unable to control his laughter, he chuckled heartily, “Black Corpse Holy Ring! The heavens didn’t let me down!”

After searching far and wide for the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance, he had finally found it! Huang Xiaolong had actually delivered the treasure right into his hands!

A smile slowly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he looked at the comical position Dou Rui was in. If Huang Xiaolong could only kill a single person the entire trial, he would hesitate to use his chance upon Dou Rui! Luckily for him, there wasn’t such a rule, and Huang Xiaolong could kill all he wanted.

Dou Rui glanced at Huang Xiaolong after he caught his breath. “Huang Xiaolong, it’s your lucky day! After killing you, I’ll be able to take revenge for my junior brothers! I can also deal with my heart demons once you die! Not to mention the fact that the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance will fall into my hands!”

“What a coincidence. You ran rampant in the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate in the past, and I was looking for a chance to kill you. Today, you actually delivered yourself up for slaughter. I can finally take revenge for the billions who died at your hands!”

“Pfffft! You’ve been looking for an opportunity to kill me?! Do you really think that you can take revenge for the disciples of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate?”

“I’m trying to control myself, but you’re making a joke out of yourself!” Dou Rui continued. “Huang Xiaolong, you’re a f*cking id*ot! It’s no wonder Lin Xiaoying is so entertained by you!”

“?!” Lin Xiaoying looked at Huang Xiaolong, and her face flushed red. She couldn’t help but let her thoughts wander as she stood closer to him. The frosty qi around her body slowly started to expand as she hurried him to leave, “What are you waiting for?!”

“Leave? Not a single one of you can leave today! Since you wish to be together, I’ll send you both to hell!”

Before he could make his move, a lazy voice rang through the air, “Dou Rui, wait for me. It’s a pity if you kill the beauty in a fit of rage!”

Another figure appeared, and a frigid yin aura filled the area.

“You Lingzi!” Dou Rui and Lin Xiaoying called out at the same time.

By this time, Huang Xiaolong had already lost his place in the top ten spots and You Lingzi had managed to claw his way up to the 7th spot.

Dou Rui’s heart sank. He had never expected that this weird guy would show up when he was about to succeed! He was at the peak of the early-Second Heaven True Saint Realm, and he was a whole lot stronger than Dou Rui.

Lin Xiaoying finally started to panic. Dealing with Dou Rui was pushing it, and another terrifying existence had come to crash the party!

Even if Ji Xinyi came over, they wouldn’t be able to deal with their opponents! The only way for them to escape was if their senior sister, Tan Juan, arrived. The look in You Lingzi’s eyes had already caused goosebumps to grow all over her body.

Without caring about Dou Rui’s intentions, You Lingzi said, “You can deal with Huang Xiaolong as you deem fit. Lin Xiaoying is mine. As for the treasury, we’ll split it 60/40.”

Dou Rui’s expression sank, and he sneered coldly, “B*llsh*t! I found the ring first. I’ll take 60 percent.”

A frown formed on You Lingzi’s face, and he stared coldly at Dou Rui. “50/50.”

After a short hesitation, Dou Rui nodded his head.

Just like that, they managed to reach a deal.

As soon as they were done splitting up the rewards, Dou Rui approached Huang Xiaolong and You Lingzi walked towards Lin Xiaoying.
