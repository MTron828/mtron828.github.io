Chapter 3325: One Punch!

The old ancestor of the Thousand Extermination Sect heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the gates closing. The other expert was the old ancestor of the Training Star Sect and he  looked at the Yuanpin Heavenly Pearl in his hand. The two of them roared with laughter in their hearts.

The two pearls were absolute treasures, and they were countless times better than any herb they could obtain on earth. If they refined the pearls, they would be able to refine their qi veins and physical bodies. They would actually gain a chance to enter the Spirit Severing Realm!

The beast tide slammed into the gates as they were celebrating in their hearts, but they were stopped by the formations around the city. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Amidst the roars of the beasts, everyone trapped outside screamed in terror.

Miserable shrieks filled the skies.

A teacher of one of the universities was swallowed whole by one of the beasts around them.

The teacher was from the Technological University, and he was at the Golden Core Realm! Despite that, he didn’t even get the chance to fight back!

Lin Kai and the others felt the blood draining from their faces when they saw what happened.

“Everyone, gather around!” Zhang Yuhan screamed. “All Nascent Soul Realm cultivators on the outside to protect the students!” She raised her sword to begin the counterattack.

“Tears of Asura!” Waving her blades and circulating her true qi, blade light rained down on the beasts.

Tears of Asura was the second move in the Asura Sword Art, and it was obviously something Huang Xiaolong taught her. As one of the moves he used when he just started his cultivation journey, the Asura Sword Art held a special place in his heart. At his current level, he improved it many times over before teaching it to others.

“Huh?!” The two old ancestors yelled in shock when they saw her sword art.

“Peak of the Ninth Level Nascent Soul Realm? Who is that woman?” The old ancestor of the Thousand Extermination Sect asked the supervisor of the city.

Li Dongyuan, the supervisor, hastily replied, “She’s the head of the Eastern University, Zhang Yuhan! She’s Lord Huang Xiaolong’s old lover…”

“Huang Xiaolong?” Hearing his name again, the old ancestor of the Training Star Sect, Ma Lin, frowned, “Who is Huang Xiaolong?”

“He’s the leader of the grand elders of the Huang Family in the Donglin Province.” 

“Heh, he’s just a mere grand elder of a mortal family. I thought he was some big shot.” Kong Hui, the old ancestor of the Thousand Extermination Sect, snorted.

“The only family that possesses an acceptable level of power in the Huaxia Alliance is the Ying Family. Everyone else is trash.” Ma Lin sneered.

The two of them might be at the Ninth Level Enlightenment Realm, they were still pretty afraid of Ying Tian.

Thinking if he should explain the current situation to the old ancestors, Li Dongyuan decided against it eventually. Due to his low position in the family, he hadn’t heard of Huang Xiaolong’s crescent deeds. The only news he had came from the grand elders’ conversation. 

A cry rang through the air all of a sudden as Zhang Yuhan’s sword flew about in the crowd of beasts. Every time it landed, one of the beasts would fall.

“Nice sword art!” The two ancestors couldn’t help but praise.

Even though they couldn’t understand the principles behind the sword art, they were able to see that her skills weren’t ordinary.

“I wonder how she cultivated such a powerful set of sword art…” A fire burned in Ma Lin’s eyes.

Everyone could see that he had his eyes set on the Asura Sword Art.

However, he gave up on the idea when he saw the beast tide standing between Zhang Yuhan and the city.

All of a sudden, one of the beasts lunged at Lin Kai.

Screaming in fright, Zhang Yuhan wanted to head over to protect him but she was stopped by a beast in the Enlightenment Realm.

As the beast opened its mouth to chomp down on the kid, a ray of light emerged from Lin Kai’s chest and sent the beast flying.

Like a meteor, the beast slammed heavily into the city walls and giant cracks formed on it.

Staring at the jade pendant on Lin Kai’s chest, everyone widened their eyes in shock.

“Is that… Is that a spiritual treasure?!” The old ancestors of the two sects felt their jaws dropping in fright.

“It definitely is! Moreover, it has to be a mid-grade spiritual treasure!” Ma Lin gasped in shock.

Mid-grade spiritual treasure! Even for the six strongest sects, a treasure at that level was considered an inheritance treasure!

…

A ray of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he stopped in mid air. He stared in the direction of the Huaxia Alliance all of a sudden.

Yuan Hui couldn’t help but ask, “Your Highness, this…”

“My nephew is in trouble.” As soon as the words left his lips, he grabbed Yuan Hui and took a step forward. Yuan Hui couldn’t even react as the world started to spin around him.

Originally, they would take more than an hour before they could return. However, Huang Xiaolong shifted the space around them and they appeared a distance away from the beast tide.

Zhang Yuhan and the others were surrounded by a group of beasts, and Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned frosty in an instant. Tearing through the skies, a snort left his lips.

The soundwave caused the world to tremble, and even those located in the innermost part of the city heard the snort.

Sucking in a cold breath, everyone turned to look at the shore.

With Zhang Yuhan and Lin Kai in danger, Huang Xiaolong knew that it was time to make a move. With a fist, he summoned an ice dragon that stretched for thousands of miles as they tore through the surface of the sea. The entire ocean was split in two, as the ice dragon made its way towards the beasts on shore.

The two old ancestors who were standing on the city gates saw something they would never forget as long as they lived. The ice dragon brought with it an untold amount of power as it smashed into the group of beasts who were surrounding the students and teachers of the universities. 

In an instant, countless beasts were sent crashing into the city walls as they shattered the protective formation. 

The earth rumbled and the skies shook.

Zhang Yuhan and the others looked at the beasts who had slammed into the city walls and noticed that every single beast no longer showed any signs of life.

Even the beasts in the Enlightenment Realm died just like that!

Like wooden statues, everyone slowly turned to look at the figure standing high in the skies above the East Sea.

As cultivators, they were at least able to see that far ahead, and they saw a figure standing in the skies.

With a slight frown on his face, Huang Xiaolong crossed his arms in front of him. His robes fluttered in the wind.
