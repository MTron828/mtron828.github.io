Chapter 2790: Meeting Yi Xiaotang Again

Zhu Yu’s transmission symbol trembled again, and he was stunned when he read the report. Rushing over to the Saint Devil Prince, he chuckled, “Your Highness, I received news that Young Lady Yi Xiaotang has also arrived!”

A trace of joy flashed across the Saint Devil Prince’s face. “Senior Sister Xiaotang is here too? Did you determine the direction she went towards?”

“According to our intelligence report, Young Lady Xiaotang and Lord Qing went towards the southeast.”

The Saint Devil Prince was stunned. “They’re going southeast too?”

“Yes…” Zhu Yu nodded slowly.

All of a sudden, the Saint Devil Prince burst into laughter, “Alright! That’s even better! When I kill Huang Xiaolong and obtain the Qilin Chariot, I’ll give the ice attributed qilin to Senior Sister Xiaotang! I’ll leave the fire attributed qilin for myself!”

“Senior Sister Xiaotang will definitely love the ice qilin… She has been looking for a mount for the longest time!”

“As for the Immemorial Chariot, I’ll hand it over to Dao Venerable Qing! After all, her birthday is coming soon… I should give her a good present!”

The more he thought about it, the happier the Saint Devil Prince became.

Since the Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin never left each other’s side, the world would know that he and Xiaotang were a couple after he gave it to her!

Moreover, he might even be able to obtain Aunt Qing’s heart after he gave her the chariot on her birthday!

He felt that Aunt Qing favored him quite a lot since the time he entered the Blue Heaven Creed.

As he thought about the endless possibilities, he accelerated towards the southeastern direction.

As the Saint Devil Prince and the others slowly made their way towards Huang Xiaolong, he had already arrived on top of the Immemorial Mountain Range.

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback as he looked at the Immemorial Dao Palace sitting at the peak of the mountain. However, joy soon flashed through his heart.

The Immemorial Dao Palace was made from a massive piece of Immemorial Grand Dao Rock. Even though it was only several miles large, it was nearly impossible to find a piece of Immemorial Grand Dao Rock of that size.

He could clearly see that the palace was surrounded by the immemorial grand formation that absorbed endless amounts of energy from the world. He knew that if he managed to obtain the Immemorial Dao Palace, his cultivation speed would reach a terrifying level.

Unable to conceal the excitement in his heart, Huang Xiaolong urged the Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin to advance towards the palace.

However, he found that the entrance of the palace was open the moment he arrived.

“Someone has already entered the palace…” His heart sank.

If someone had really entered the palace before him, wouldn’t that mean that they would have already refined the eye of the formation?!

Without wasting a single second, Huang Xiaolong charged towards the depths of the palace.

From the outside, the palace looked small. However, there was a separate space inside the palace that filled up the size of a continent!

Releasing his dao souls, Huang Xiaolong realized that the suppression was even stronger in the palace. The space he could observe was limited to several miles around him.

Asking the qilins for the location of the treasury, he sped towards it in the chariot. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The beasts did not know where the Immemorial Sword was held, but they knew the approximate location of the treasury.

Feeling the wind brushing past his face as he sped towards the treasury, Huang Xiaolong grabbed any holy trees or holy herbs he could find. The herbs in the palace were reaching the level of grand dao herbs due to the nourishment inside the palace, and all of them couldn’t be easily valued.

The moment they became grand dao herbs, even Dao Venerables would fight over them!

It went without saying that the holy herbs he obtained in the palace were several times better than those outside.

However, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care less about the herbs as he only retrieved those that didn’t require any effort! The only thing he cared about was the Immemorial Sword!

According to his guess, the Immemorial Sword should be located in the treasury of the Immemorial Dao Palace!

He would be able to control the entire immortal cave as soon as he refined the eye of the formation, and since someone had entered the palace before him, he could only assume that they had already located the treasury!

The fire in Huang Xiaolong’s heart burned even brighter as he could only hope that the party who had entered before him would be trapped by some random formation in the dao palace.

Seemingly able to detect Huang Xiaolong’s anxiety, the Immemorial Qilins tore through the air as they pushed their speed to the limit.

Since the two of them knew where all the formations in the palace were, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid that they would get caught in a trap.

“Ten more minutes… Just ten minutes…” Huang Xiaolong prayed in his heart.

The closer he got, the more anxious he became.

Just as he was about to arrive at the treasury of the Immemorial Dao Palace, a burst of light distracted him. Sword qi gathered as waves of energy fluctuated in the space somewhere in front of him.

It seemed as though someone had activated a restriction around the treasury, and they were currently trying to destroy the formation trapping them! A burst of excitement filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart as he felt that there was actually hope of him arriving first.

Very quickly, he arrived at the spot where he saw the bright flash of light, and he quickly noticed the two people trapped in the formation.

He couldn’t help but feel a sense of shock when he saw them.

In the past, he had seen the two of them when he had dealt with Chen Sen and the other members of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land. He recalled that they were part of the spectators.

The reason he remembered them wasn’t because of their looks, but it was because one of the ladies was already at the peak of the late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm while the other was a step ahead of her. The other lady was already half a step into the Dao Venerable Realm.

After such a lengthy explanation, one could already guess that the ladies trapped in the formation were Aunt Qing and Yi Xiaotang.

“It’s you!” Yi Xiaotang yelled when she saw Huang Xiaolong. She couldn’t help but gasp in shock. In the past, Huang Xiaolong was only at the early-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm, but he was able to defeat all the Primal Ancestors who stood against him. It was also the reason she had developed a strong impression of Huang Xiaolong.

Ignoring the two of them, Huang Xiaolong planned to continue his journey towards the treasury. He could see that the two of them would be able to shatter the formation even without his help. The only problem would be that they would require several days to do so.

When they saw that Huang Xiaolong was planning to leave, Yi Xiaotang couldn’t help but yell, “Hold it right there!”

With question marks popping up in his mind, Huang Xiaolong stopped.

“I am the daughter of the Blue Heaven Dao Venerable! Why are you ignoring us! Help us now!” Yi Xiaotang snapped.

The question marks in Huang Xiaolong’s mind turned to exclamation marks as he didn’t expect for her to be the daughter of a Dao Venerable.

“Why are you standing there like a dumb*ss? Hurry up and help us!”
