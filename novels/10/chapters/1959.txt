A weird light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The birth of a treasure?

Who gave out the news? Was it Dun Ei? Or was it Lan Zhi?

Huang Xiaolong laughed coldly to himself. Were they really trying to stop him by doing something like that? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Circulating the Heavenly Hall’s power in his body, Huang Xiaolong searched for the other half’s location.

Despite having one half of the Heavenly Hall, it would have been challenging if Huang Xiaolong had to look through the boundless Radiance Divine World to locate the other half of the inheritance. Luckily for him, Dun Ei had narrowed down the scope to the Sea of Radiance.

Huang Xiaolong really wanted to thank Dun Ei for his ‘kind gesture.’

Perhaps because too many experts had run all the way to the Sea of Radiance to search for treasures, Huang Xiaolong didn’t run into a single radiance beast while roaming about the Sea.

After an hour of searching, just as Huang Xiaolong passed by a desolate island, a brilliant ray of bright light shot into the sky and charged towards him.

Turning his head, Huang Xiaolong noticed a radiance beast with the head of an iron eagle. It flew towards him, but it was a pity it only possessed the strength of an Ancestor God.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother moving his hands. He activated his Emperor’s will and turned the radiance beast into dust.

Without stopping for a single moment, Huang Xiaolong continued his advance.

The deeper he reached into the Sea of Radiance, the number of radiance beasts he ran into increased. They were getting stronger and stronger. Initially, he only met beasts at the Ancient God or Ancestor God Realm. The deeper he went, the mid-level Ancestor Gods slowly appeared. Their strength increased, and eventually, God King Realm beasts appeared.

Four days later, Huang Xiaolong was attacked by a Sixth Order God King Realm beast.

Right after he killed the beast with his Emperor’s will and continued heading forward, a surprised cry sounded out in a distant place.

Applause soon broke out.

“Amazing strength!” A shocked cry came out of the mouth of someone in the approaching group.

Huang Xiaolong turned around, and he saw a group of people wearing radiance battle armor approaching him. There were nearly two hundred of them, and none of them were weak. There were several high-level God King Realm experts and some low-level Heavenly Monarchs among them.

The person leading them was a young man with a headful of dark blue hair. There was an insignia of a knight on his chest.

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the insignia on his chest, he knew that the young man was someone from the Radiance Knight Corp. He was at the peak of the early-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, but he wasn’t the strongest person present in the group. Despite that, he was the leader of the group.

Huang Xiaolong ignored them and continued flying forward.

When they saw that Huang Xiaolong was ignoring all of them, one of them screamed, “Hold it!” His figure flashed and appeared before Huang Xiaolong, blocking his way.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed by a single millimeter.

Before he could say anything, the dark blue-haired youngster waved his hand to chase away the person blocking Huang Xiaolong’s way.

He personally brought the group over to Huang Xiaolong and chuckled, “I am a captain of the Radiance Knight Corp, Lu Feng. I have no other intentions. Are you also here to search for the treasure? There are too many beasts in the Sea of Radiance, and it will be dangerous for you to go alone. I would like to extend an invitation for you to join our group. After all, it would be easier to move about with others.”

“I’m not interested.” Huang Xiaolong rejected him without hesitation.

Lu Feng stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

After he spoke, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother waiting. He flew across the air and left.

“Young master, that brat doesn’t know what’s good for him. After learning about your identity as a captain in the Radiance Knight Corp, he still rejected your invitation!” The man, who had blocked Huang Xiaolong’s way previously, snorted.

He was at the mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, and he was one of the strongest ones in the group.

Lu Feng laughed, and he didn’t care about Huang Xiaolong’s rejection in the slightest. “If he dares to reject my invitation, he definitely has someone to rely on. He’s pretty strong. He should be cultivating some sort of soul skill. To be able to kill a Sixth Order God King Realm beast, that’s something even Tenth Order God Kings will find hard to do.”

The mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch continued, “Even so, he should be at the Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. With the young master’s identity, even high-level Heavenly Monarchs have to bow down to you! If not for young master’s interference, I would have taught that kid a lesson!”

Lu Feng’s transmissions symbol shook, and the moment he took it out, a look of joy appeared on his face.

“Young master, this is...?” The mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch asked.

“Someone made a report! A ten-winged pegasus has appeared!”

“What?! Ten-winged pegasus?!”

A Pegasus was the strongest creature in the Radiance Divine World. It was almost impossible to see one, let alone one with ten wings.

A ten-winged pegasus was something even the pontiffs would fight over to obtain!

“It’s pretty strong. It should be in the Second Order Emperor Realm or above.” Lu Feng said. “I have to contact my father immediately!”

His father was Lu Zhaoming, and he was a bishop in the Radiance Knight Corp. He was a late-Third Order Emperor.

The highest-ranked individual in the Radiance Knight Corp was Elan, and there were several archbishops under him. Bishops ranked lower than that.

As a bishop in the Radiance Knight Corp, he would be able to command a million radiance knights.

A knight in the Radiance Knight Corp wasn’t someone that ordinary disciples in the top hundred Emperor Palaces could compare to. Every single one of them passed through countless trials and tests. Only then would they be accepted into the corp. Moreover, only high-level God Kings would be accepted into the army.

One could imagine the might of a million radiance knights!

This time, Lu Feng had come to the Sea of Radiance with his father. Lu Zhaoming could rush towards Lu Feng whenever he received the signal.

Lu Feng hastily sent a message to his father.

By then, Huang Xiaolong had already left, and he charged towards the south. According to his sixth sense, the second half of the inheritance was located in the southern area of the Sea of Radiance.

Several hours passed, and Huang Xiaolong continued to fly forward. All of a sudden, shocking fluctuations slammed into him, and Huang Xiaolong raised his head in shock. He saw a creature in pure white soaring into the sky. Looking closer, he noticed that it was a white horse with an adorable horn growing out from its forehead. Five pairs of wings hung on its back.

“Pegasus?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

There were also ten wings on its back.

Even though it wasn’t as precious as the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin he had bought in Hell, it wasn’t too far off.

The ten-winged pegasus was extremely quick, and it quickly flew away from its previous position. A group of experts chased behind it, and if there weren’t ten thousand of them, there were definitely eight thousand. It was a sight to behold.

The ten-winged pegasus soon arrived before Huang Xiaolong.
