Chapter 2535: Destroy His Corpse!

Qiao Jinyang’s grand dao law appeared before the holy souls in a flash. Even though it was said that holy souls had already transcended the reincarnation cycle, it was nothing before a thread of grand dao law. The moment it was shattered by the grand dao, a True Saint would die!

The Opening Heaven Dragon Spear in Huang Xiaolong’s hand shot out suddenly to meet the thread of grand dao law.

It was the grand dao law comprehended by the Heavenly Master!

Since Qiao Jinyang could seal his grand dao law into the Fiend Moon Blade, the Heavenly Master was naturally able to do the same.

Boom! Two threads of grand dao slammed into each other, and the heavens trembled. The three of them felt the world spinning, and it was as though their life and death were no longer under their control.

Huang Xiaolong fared the best out of the three, but looks of fear appeared on the faces of the other two.

With a shake of his body, Li Chen arrived beside Huang Xiaolong’s Buddhist-attributed holy soul all of a sudden.

Since Huang Xiaolong’s dragon-attributed holy soul was holding onto the Opening Heaven Dragon Spear, it made no sense to attack it. The devil-attributed holy soul held onto the blood stele, and the Buddhist-attributed holy soul was the weakest!

Li Chen was no rookie. As long as he managed to hurt one of Huang Xiaolong’s holy souls, the tides of the battle would change.

However, a resplendent ray of light shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s chest before Li Chen could unleash its attack. Another trace of grand dao law smashed towards Li Chen.

According to his plan, he would crush Huang Xiaolong’s Buddhist-attributed holy soul in one strike. Never in his wildest imaginations would he have thought that Huang Xiaolong had an Inextinguishable Dao Heart. The speed of the grand dao law was outside his scope of comprehension, and it arrived before he could react.

The world seemed to stop as Li Chen felt his holy soul falling into the rivers of reincarnation. He was no longer able to control his body as a terrifying pressure crushed him.

For the first time in his life, fear gripped his heart.

Turning to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a horrified gaze, he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s chest. Xie Bufan, who was ready to strike again, widened his eyes in shock and his feelings mirrored Li Chen’s. He didn’t understand what was going on and Huang Xiaolong’s chest seemed to become even more attractive than the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace.

“You… Inextinguishable Dao Heart?!” Li Chen’s tongue was tied, and he failed to speak properly.

His body started to tremble as his vision threatened to go dark.

Inextinguishable Dao Heart!

Huang Xiaolong had a f*cking Dao Heart!

Li Chen didn’t dare to believe what he just saw.

Xie Bufan was equally as shocked, and his jaws dropped in horror.

A half-True Saint like Huang Xiaolong had actually managed to form an Inextinguishable Dao Heart! That was absolutely absurd!

“That’s right. It’s my Inextinguishable Dao Heart!” Huang Xiaolong admitted. With a sudden shake of the spear, the Heaven Opening Dragon Spear pierced into Li Chen’s chest.

Pulling out the tip of the spear in one smooth motion, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate to deal Li Chen a serious blow.

Staring at the gaping hole in his chest, Li Chen didn’t react immediately.

As he fell from the skies with a look of disbelief on his face, Xie Bufan turned around and ran.

He was too frightened to continue fighting.

To battle someone with a Dao Heart was basically suicide!

He could accept the fact that Huang Xiaolong had three holy souls, and he had a dao artifact bestowed upon him by the Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens. However, the other party actually had an Inextinguishable Dao Heart! Even if he was given a thousand years, he wouldn’t be able to kill Huang Xiaolong! If he continued to battle, he would suffer the same fate as Li Chen!

As for the fact that Huang Xiaolong was holding on to the key to the seventh level, Xie Bufan could care less about that.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air as Xie Bufan made his escape. “Xie Bufan, do you really think that you can run now?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After revealing his Inextinguishable Dao Heart, Huang Xiaolong was determined to kill everyone.

As his dragon attributed holy soul shook, the phantom arrived behind Xie Bufan, and it slashed down with the Opening Heaven Dragon Spear.

As Xie Bufan raised his Fiend Moon Blade to protect his dear life, Huang Xiaolong’s grand dao law took the window of opportunity to attack.

With no time to think, Xie Bufan could only raise his left hand to unleash his strongest attack.

“Evil Devil Light!”

With his fist whistling through the air, it turned into a streak of light that smashed into the thread of grand dao law.

The Evil Devil Light was also a dao art comprehended by Qiao Jinyang, and it contained a shocking amount of power.

Boom!

When the two attacks slammed into each other, the space around them crumbled.

Even though the Evil Devil Light contained extraordinary power, the thread of grand dao law wasn’t something he could devour so easily.

If Qiao Jinyang was present, he would be able to crush the thread of grand dao law Huang Xiaolong comprehended with ease. However, Xie Bufan was a mere Second Heaven True Saint!

Piercing through the Evil Devil Light, the thread of grand dao law pierced through Xie Bufan’s chest.

Like Li Chen, Xie Bufan could feel himself losing control of his body as his holy soul was suppressed by an unimaginably strong presence.

The Heaven Opening Dragon Spear did its job once again, and a fountain of blood emerged from Xie Bufan’s chest. His end was a little worse than Li Chen as Huang Xiaolong went all out to prevent him from escaping.

No one could endure a strike from Huang Xiaolong’s grand dao law and a strike from the Heaven Opening Dragon Spear. At least, no one currently in the Cangqiong Holy Manor could do so.

Falling from the skies, Xie Bufan slammed heavily into the ground as the Fiend Moon Blade landed beside him.

Walking slowly towards Xie Bufan, Huang Xiaolong stared at his sorry figure.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you want?!” Looking at Huang Xiaolong, Xie Bufan forced himself to act as calmly as he could. Giant waves were battering against his frail little heart when he realized that he couldn’t put up the slightest resistance against the man.

“It’s a little unnecessary to ask this question now, no?” Huang Xiaolong responded.

Xie Bufan’s expression sank as his mind worked in overdrive to think of a way out of this. “Fine! Since I’m going to die, I hope you can leave my corpse alone! Leave me with a complete body when I die!”

“Impossible.” Huang Xiaolong wanted nothing more than to refine his seventh-rank Saint godhead, and it was impossible to leave him with a complete corpse.

A trace of grief appeared in Xie Bufan’s heart when he realized that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t even let him die peacefully. The leader of the devil princes would die without a complete corpse…

No longer speaking to the other party, Huang Xiaolong sealed his mouth and threw him into the Black Corpse Holy Ring. Turning to Li Chen, Huang Xiaolong slowly made his way over.
