Chapter 3250: Number One in the Milky Way

“Okay, Uncle, the Swiss Bank’s branch is in our Donglin Province’s Laixin City!” Huang Datou nodded his head. He did not ask what Huang Xiaolong was going to exchange, and he wasn’t curious or concerned about it.

“Oh, Laixin City?” Huang Xiaolong smiled. “Maybe we would run into Tan Wei tomorrow.”

Huang Datou stiffened as this point had not occurred to him until his uncle had mentioned it. Not that Huang Xiaolong had brought it up, his heartbeat quickened, but there was hesitation in his eyes. More accurately, it was a ready-to-flight reaction.

“I’ll be there.” Huang Xiaolong cheered him up, “If the sky falls down, Uncle will hold it up for you. Love and happiness are what you need to strive for yourself. Uncle can’t help you with that.”

Huang Datou took a deep breath and nodded his head, “I understand, Uncle!”

His gaze became determined.

“Brother, you can sleep in my room,” Huang Chenfei said as he walked out from his room.

Their small house had three rooms, Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan slept in one room. He had the second room, and his son, Huang Datou, slept in the third. The number was just right for them, but with Huang Xiaolong’s return, the rooms were insufficient.

“No need. I’ll meditate here for a night!” Huang Xiaolong declined, it was merely for the night.

It was because after exchanging spirit stones from the Swiss Bank the next day, he would buy back their old residence, and also buy another place next to the old residence.

The Son of Creation did not even have his own residence. That was simply too shameful.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong say that he was going to meditate in midair for a night, Huang Chenfei persuaded, “No, brother, just sleep in my room in the future. You can’t meditate in the air every night, right? I can share a room with Datou.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, waving his hand. “I already said it’s unnecessary. Datou and I are going to the Swiss Bank’s branch in Donglin Province tomorrow to exchange spirit stones. I will buy a place after that, and we can all move into a new place tomorrow.” He looked around and added, “We won’t be living here anymore by tomorrow night!”

“What?! Brother, you want to buy a house!” Huang Chenfei was genuinely surprised.

Huang Datou also looked at his uncle with wide eyes.

“Xiaolong, you want to buy a house?” Coincidentally, Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan came out of their room at this time, and heard Huang Chenfei’s words.

“The houses in Huazhou City nowadays are not cheap, and a hundred square meters place in the city center costs twenty to thirty thousand low-grade spirit stones. Houses in remote locations like ours cost at least ten thousand low-grade spirit stones.”

As for those villas in the city center, Wang Meilan didn’t even want to bring them up. Not many families’ elders could afford to buy those villas. Moreover, in Wang Meilan’s opinion, those were far out of her reach.

Huang Xiaolong reassured them, “Don’t worry, Dad, Mom, you all don’t need to worry about money anymore from tomorrow onwards.”

Huang Jiyuan didn’t think too much into his son’s words, but he merely smiled and said, “It’s good news to us that Xiaolong wants to buy a house, and after Xiaolong buys this house, we’ll get a big spiritual hog beast and celebrate!”

According to Huang Jiyuan, buying a whole spiritual hog beast was the best and most luxurious way of celebrating.

“Right, right, right!” Wang Meilan agreed with a big smile, “We must also buy several catties of spiritual fruits!”

Huang Datou’s eyes lit up immediately. “I love to eat the Golden Flame Spiritual Fruit. We should get that!”

The Golden Flame Spiritual Fruit was one of the spiritual fruits available on the market. It tasted good, nourished the body, and had many other benefits. It was one of the most popular spiritual fruits on Earth, and it didn’t come cheap. Huang Datou had only eaten it once.

Wang Meilan agreed crisply, “Okay, we will get one catty of Golden Flame Spiritual Fruit!”

Huang Xiaolong’s intention of buying a house filled the house with another wave of joyous atmosphere.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled as he really liked this kind of atmosphere.

An apartment in the city center? Huang Xiaolong smiled to himself.

Huang Xiaolong insisted on meditating in the air for the night, Huang Chenfei could only return to his own room.

The ethereal night sky softly lit by the moonlight enveloped Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the starry night sky.

Coming back to Earth this time, other than seeing his family on Earth, the most important thing was finding Pangu’s axe. He couldn’t use the power of his inner world, and could not use his dao souls’ power. Moreover, his overall strength was suppressed by the powerful array formation placed by Pangu himself. His strength was suppressed down to peak late-Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm, so he could only resort to employing Earth’s secular world manpower!

The night passed quietly.

Huang Xiaolong stood up as the morning sun’s radiant sunlight fell on his body.

A while later, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, Huang Chenfei, and Huang Datou roused from their sleep.

Huang Xiaolong looked at them as he descended to the ground.

“Xiaolong, you must be careful in Laixin City! I know that you’re already a Nascent Soul Realm expert, but when you’re passing the Xiang’an Mountain Range, it’s better to take the longer route.”

Wang Meilan advised, “There are many fierce beasts roaming in the Xing’an Mountain Range, and it’s very dangerous.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, indicating that he had remembered his mother’s words.

Wang Meilan went on to tell Huang Xiaolong the things he should pay attention to along the way as if it was Huang Xiaolong’s first time going out.

Huang Xiaolong listened with a helpless expression.

Huang Datou chimed in, “Grandma, Uncle is a Nascent Soul expert, and your grandson, me, is merely a First Level Xiantian Realm, so the person you should be worried about is me!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Meilan shot Huang Datou a fierce glare. “I’m talking to your uncle. Children shouldn’t interrupt!”

Huang Datou’s face was all wrinkled up in bitterness.

Huang Jiyuan and Huang Chenfei exchanged a meaningful look with mirth in their eyes.

Several minutes later, Huang Xiaolong and Huang Datou stepped out from the house, but before leaving, Huang Xiaolong tapped his finger in the air. Huang Jiyuan and the others merely felt a slight ripple in the air.

“Dad, Mom, I have put a formation around the house, and these are the jade keys for the formation, so put it on your bodies. If people come to attack you, you will be safe as long as you remain inside this yard!” Huang Xiaolong explained as he took out three jade tokens and gave one each to Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and Huang Chenfei. He then squeezed a drop of blood essence from them and dropped it onto the jade token.

“You, you’re versed in formations as well? Just simply point your finger and it’s done. A formation?” Huang Jiyuan said as he looked at the jade token in his left hand. He found it hard to believe that Huang Xiaolong had already laid out a formation around the house merely by tapping his finger like that.

Formation masters were precious in each family and sect, an outstanding formation master within the family or sect was given the same treatment as the old ancestor.

However, according to Huang Jiyuan’s understanding, even a brilliant formation master couldn’t possibly complete a formation with a mere tap.

Huang Xialong grinned, “At my current level, I should be the number one formation master in the entire Milky Way!”

Not only in the entire Milky Way, but in the whole Pangu World, and probably only Hong Jun, that old man’s knowledge in formation surpassed him.

“The whole Milky Way?” Wang Meilan chided jokingly, “This child, he’s gotten better at bragging after coming back. Why don’t you say you’re number one in the whole universe?”

After some banter, Huang Xiaolong and Huang Datou left under the others’ send-off.

Just as the two of them left Huazhou City, within the Huang Family’s main residence, Huang Bo pushed a delicate-looking box towards the Huang Family’s honorary elder, Chen Yu, as he said, “Honorary Elder Chen Yu, inside here is the roaring dragon jade that you’ve always wanted. I want you to help me deal with one person!”
