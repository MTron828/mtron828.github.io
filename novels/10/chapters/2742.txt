Chapter 2743: Investigate

Upon hearing that, Chen Yueyang and the rest immediately understood Chen Birui’s intention.

“Since Brother Chen plans to remain at Cangqiong Sacred Land, then we’ll stay as well. We’ll follow Brother Chen’s lead.” Cheng Yueyang went on good-naturedly, “If Brother Chen has any instructions, we will certainly obey.”

Gao Chen and the other worshiped experts quickly showed their attitudes as well, agreeing with Cheng Yueyang’s words.

Chen Birui laughed heartily. “Excellent, when I take over the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s patriarch position, I definitely will treat you all well. In the future, everything in Cangqiong Sacred Land will be shared between us. Brothers, you can also take your pick of the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s female disciples!”

Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the others congratulated Chen Birui in advance, and their laughter rang through the palace as if Chen Birui had already taken over the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s patriarch position.

They weren’t worried about Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land refusing to cooperate with Chen Birui. After all, Chen Birui was the opposite of Cangqiong Old Man. He was once a Saint Devil Sacred Land’s disciple with a strong background, and he was wealthy. This connection more or less influenced many things. Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land would naturally cooperate with Chen Birui.

While Chen Birui, Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the other two worshiped experts were talking and laughing merrily, Li Fuyang was half-carried into the hall by Chen Dong, Wang Junqi, and Zhang Sen.

The sounds of laughter died abruptly.

“Fuyang, what happened? Who did this?” Chen Birui’s gaze turned icy as he looked at his disciple’s abnormally swollen face.

Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and others were perplexed. Clearly, Li Fuyang was beaten not long ago, but was there anyone in the Cangqiong Sacred Land who had the guts to slap Li Fuyang?

Li Fuyang wept bitterly, “Master, it's Wang Xueru that slut and her leman!”

Chen Birui, Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the three other worshiped experts were caught off guard.

Wang Xueru? Leman?

“Recount everything in detail,” Chen Birui ordered sternly.

Thus, Li Fuyang and others recounted what had happened in detail. Naturally, many details of the incident were distorted in their favor.

“You’re saying that despite knowing that you’re my personal disciple, he told you to scram, and when you merely protested with a sentence, he ordered his subordinate to slap you till this point?”

Chen Birui’s face was gloomy to the extreme.

“Yes!” When mentioning Huang Xiaolong, there was a flash of cruelty across Li Fuyang’s face, and he added, “That punk is arrogant without bounds.”

Cheng Yueyang and the others exchanged silent looks.

“Following Fuyang’s recount, that young man’s subordinate should be a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor, right? He is an early Ninth Heaven True Saint, yet has a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert as his subordinate. It seems like that young man’s background is not simple,” Cheng Yueyang surmised. “He could be one of the big sacred lands’ family’s disciples.”

“I understand what you brothers mean,” Chen Birui said whilst nodding his head. “Don’t worry. I won’t make any rash moves before finding out that young man’s background.”

Cheng Yueyang and the rest relaxed upon hearing that.

“It’s weird. Shouldn’t Wang Xueru’s group be at the Ice Blue Sacred Land’s Thunder Fire Sacred Peak, attending the Convent of Winds and Clouds? Why are they back already? And why did they bring back such a mysterious young man with them?” Gao Chen was full of doubts.

Chen Birui, Cheng Yueyang, and the others were just as doubtful.

“What went on exactly? Send people to find out.” Chen Birui’s eyes glimmered, and he immediately ordered a subordinate to go inquire about what had happened in the Convent of Winds and Clouds.

Huang Xiaolong had not forbidden the Ice Blue Sacred Land from speaking about the incident on the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak, and before long, Chen Birui and the others were listening to reports about Huang Xiaolong’s group.

“What?! At the Convent of Winds and Clouds, Tang Jin’s, Yuan Yue’s, and Chu Zhouyun’s physiques were smashed by that kid’s Primal Ancestor guard?! And their holy souls were imprisoned by that kid?! That kid is Cangqiong Old Man’s personal disciple, called Huang Xiaolong?!” The investigation results shocked Chen Birui.

Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the rest were just as shocked after hearing that.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Although Huang Xiaolong had not ordered Hou Ting, the patriarch of Ice Blue Sacred Land, to contain the events on the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak, he had him alter some of the details. The fact was that he was the perpetrator, who had destroyed Tang Jin’s, Yuan Yue’s, and Chu Zhouyun’s physical bodies, but it was now changed to his guard being the perpetrator.

“It is so, Worship Li,” the spy in charge of the investigation answered, and he added, “There is no limit to Huang Xiaolong’s brazen arrogance. After his guard destroyed Tang Jin’s, Yuan Yue’s, and Chu Zhouyun’s bodies, he left with Wang Xueru and other participating Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciples and came back to Cangqiong Sacred Land.”

The six worshiped experts exchanged more silent looks.

This was a large amount of information.

Tang Jin and Yuan Yue were Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s younger generation’s most dazzling disciples, yet their physical bodies were destroyed by Huang Xiaolong’s guard!

This was literally like stabbing the hornet’s nest.

“Hou Ting let them leave just like that?” Chen Birui asked in astonishment.

The spy continued with his report, “The patriarch of Ice Blue Sacred Land sent eight Primal Ancestors, including He Ba, to detain Huang Xiaolong, but all eight Primal Ancestors were injured by Huang Xiaolong’s guard. After injuring the eight Primal Ancestors, Huang Xiaolong and Wang Xueru’s group smoothly left the Ice Blue Sacred Land.”

“What?! He Ba’s group of eight Primal Ancestors were all heavily injured by Huang Xiaolong’s guard?!”

All six worshiped experts exclaimed in unison.

“Huang Xiaolong’s guard’s strength is this strong?!” Cheng Yueyang was genuinely alarmed.

“Yes, it is said the six guards by Huang Xiaolong’s side are all Primal Ancestor experts. One of them is a mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and the rest are early Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestors,” the spy reported frankly, stating Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and others’ strength.

Huang Xiaolong had Hou Ting release this information as well.

Chen Birui, Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the others were obviously shocked.

“Isn’t this Huang Xiaolong merely an early Ninth Heaven True Saint? How come there are six Primal Ancestors by his side? There’s even a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor!”

Chen Birui was shocked, filled with disbelief. “These Primal Ancestor experts are hired by him, right?!”

The spy shook his head. “According to the investigation, Huang Xiaolong once saved their lives, and he has saving grace towards them. Thus, the six of them willingly follow by his side and serve him!”

The six worshiped experts exchanged another look. Chen Birui gulped visibly as doubt and hesitation flickered back and forth in his eyes. Fortunately, he hadn’t rashly ordered Huang Xiaolong’s capture in a rage earlier.

“Huang Xiaolong really ran into dog-shit luck, having six Primal Ancestor experts following his orders,” a while later, Gao Chen mumbled with an envious expression. “There’s not much difference between him and those big sacred lands’ young lords.”

Chen Birui sneered. “My Saint Devil Sacred Land’s young lord has over a hundred Primal Ancestor experts serving by his side!”

Even though he was expelled from the Saint Devil Sacred Land a long time ago, Chen Birui still considered himself to be a disciple of the Saint Devil Sacred Land.

Cheng Yueyang and the others sat straighter at the mention of the Saint Devil Prince. The Saint Devil Prince was the Saint Devil Sacred Land’s number one genius. Not just that, but he was also the number one genius of Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. Although he was only a mid-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor at the moment, he was strong enough to battle a Dao Venerable expert!

“It might not be something to be happy about for Cangqiong Old Man to have such a personal disciple,” Chen Birui scoffed. “He ordered his subordinate to destroy Tang Jin’s, Yuan Yue’s, and Chu Zhouyun’s physical bodies. Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Chufan Sacred Land would soon take action, and Cangqiong Old Man will only die faster!”
