Huang Xiaolong!

The Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor’s voice was like a curse that fell upon the lands. As soon as he spoke, everyone turned silent. The hall masters who were asking their leaders to move against Huang Xiaolong felt their legs going soft as a look of fear appeared on their faces. Their bodies started to tremble as the blood drained from their faces.

Huang Xiaolong simply stood in his spot as he stared at the two of them. Even though he hadn’t made a move, everyone felt as though a billion rocks were pressing down on their chests. Their legs went soft as they fell to their knees before him.

Chen Xie crawled forward as tears filled his eyes. He sobbed, “Your Majesty, please... please spare my life!”

The only request he had was for Huang Xiaolong to space his miserable life!

When the Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor saw Chen Xie’s sorry appearance as he begged for his life, he faced the sky as maniacal laughter left his lips. It was as though he was mocking the heavens for the unfair treatment.

“Huang Xiaolong, I never thought that I would still meet my end at your hands!” His laughter stopped as he regained his calm. A look of resignation appeared on the Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor’s face as he continued, “Before I die, I only have a single request. I hope that you can spare the disciples of the Lightning Beast Valley.”

He got to his feet slowly and stood with his back ramrod straight as he faced Huang Xiaolong.

The prestige of an Archdevil Ancestor who had once swept unhindered through the world wasn’t something that could be sullied. He would rather die than submit.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze over the disciples and eventually nodded his head. “Fine.” He was too lazy to move against them anyway. After the word left his lips, Huang Xiaolong sent a palm strike towards the Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor. Just like that, an Archdevil Ancestor, who had once stood against the world, turned into a legend lost in history.

“Lord Archdevil Ancestor!”

The wretched cries of the disciples echoed in the air.

When Chen Xie saw the Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor’s fate, fear gripped his heart. His expression changed as he begged over and over again for mercy.

He was greeted with a cold expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face. With a flick of Huang Xiaolong’s finger, he slammed into one of the distant mountain peaks, and his corpse bored deep into the face of the structure. His skin erupted, and he turned into a mess of flesh and blood.

In the past, Huang Xiaolong was surrounded and chased down by Chen Xie and the others. Right now, the tables had turned. Killing experts like the Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor was nothing more than a flick of a finger.

Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air as he rode on the head of the Flying Devil Python. With a swish of its tail, the two of them disappeared into the distance.

Even after Huang Xiaolong’s departure, the disciples felt their clothes drenched in a cold sweat.

Without caring about the disciples, Huang Xiaolong managed to return to the mountain peak where the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus was located. When he saw the little cow and Cang Mutian, he was met with an unexpected sight. Corpses littered the space around them as blood formed a river below. It was evident that the little cow, Cang Mutian, and the three Skull Ancestors had gone on a killing spree not too long ago.

“How did it go?” When they saw Huang Xiaolong, they quickly went over to welcome him.

He laughed in response, “I found it.” After he spoke, he retrieved both stalks of Four Spirit Jade Zoysia and presented the female one to the little cow. As for the male stalk, he passed it over to Cang Mutian.

The little cow stared at Huang Xiaolong as a mesmerizing smile appeared on her face. “I knew that following you would be a good choice!”

Cang Mutian chuckled softly, “It seems like I have to learn from Old Ancestor Azure Cow and follow you around everywhere!”

The Four Spirit Jade Zoysia was nothing to Huang Xiaolong. However, it was more precious than any treasure the little cow and Cang Mutian owned.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh as he stared at the surge of experts rushing over to them.

Even though the little cow and Cang Mutian had already placed down layers upon layers of restrictions, they only managed to hide a huge portion of the origin energy coming from the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus. Even overlords like them weren’t able to completely hide the presence of an origin treasure at the level of the green lotus.

Just a tiny bit of the origin energy given off by the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus was enough to attract countless experts.

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the group of experts charging towards them, a look of indifference appeared on his face. He crossed his legs as he sat in the space above the mountain peak, waiting for the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus to complete its transformation.

He didn’t care about any of those people rushing over to their deaths. The only people who could suppress him would be existences at the level of the Reverence Moon Old Man, the Xumi Old Man, or Wan Shi.

Even though he couldn’t be bothered to move against them, Huang Xiaolong ordered for the Flying Devil Python to release its devil’s might.

With the deterrence from the Flying Devil Python’s aura, he believed that the experts would think twice before rushing over to their deaths.

He was right. As soon as they felt the aura coming from the Sovereign Realm beast, everyone froze as a look of terror formed on their faces.

“Sovereign Realm! It’s an extremely strong existence at the overlord level!”

Several old ancestors and faction leaders sucked in a cold breath when they noticed the Flying Devil Python’s aura.

The strongest ones among them were merely First or Second Order Sovereigns. Even at their level, fear gripped their hearts when they realized the other party’s strength.

A massive devil ship slowly made its way towards the Twin Devil Mountain Peak when everyone was thinking about retreating.

On the bow of the ship stood a carving of two massive dragon heads.

“It’s the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire!”

“The Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor is here!”

The cultivators from the other powers in the Kingdom of Devil Beasts hastily stepped aside when they saw the massive ship flying towards them.

“What do you think the Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor will do? Will he retreat?” Several old ancestors started to guess in their hearts.

Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, the ship merely paused for a second before flying towards Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

When everyone saw that the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor was going to confront the people guarding the treasure, they felt their hearts tremble.

“Onwards!” The old ancestor of the Sin Devil Sect chose to take the risk and follow behind the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor as he ordered for his sect to move out.

They might even be able to pick up some scraps along the way if they followed the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor. If they were to remain where they were, they would definitely return empty-handed!

The Old Ancestor of the Sin Devil Sect was part of the same generation as the Heavenless Archdevil Lord. He was a First Order Sovereign, and even though he wasn’t ranked among the super experts, he had strength comparable to the Heaven Punishment Archdevil Ancestor.

When the other factions saw the actions of the Sin Devil Sect, many of them decided to follow suit, and they left to follow behind the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor. With Sovereigns like the Sin Devil Sect’s old ancestor and the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor, they felt as though there might be a chance for them to take advantage of the situation.

When the little cow felt the presence of the various experts, a cold sneer formed on her lips. “It seems like there are people who don’t fear death. I can finally loosen my muscles!”

Cang Mutian sighed, “Birds die for food, and humans die for wealth. This is something that will never change...”

The various experts knew the dangers when they felt the presence of the Flying Devil Python. However, they still chose to fish for benefits when they caught a glimpse of hope. It seemed as though they really wanted to try their luck.

Very quickly, the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor Country’s flying ship appeared in their sights.

The little cow nearly roared with laughter when she saw the insignia of the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor Country. “I wondered where they found the courage... It seems like they are planning to hide behind the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor Country!”

Cang Mutian chuckled as well, “I haven’t seen that brat, Zhao Yuan, for so many years...” Before he had disappeared in the past, he used meet with Zhao Yuan frequently. It was when Zhao Yuan had barely entered the Sovereign Realm, and in the blink of an eye, he was already the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor whose authority stretched across the lands.
