Chapter 3675 – Reversal Sword

The Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu stared at the sword in his hand and gasped in unison, “Reversal Sword!”

That was the ranked number one sword in the thirteen universes! It was also a universe treasure itself!

According to the legends, the wielder of the Reversal Sword would gain the ability to control the power of yin and yang!

The power of yin and yang was contained in every being in the universes.

The experts currently in the Sword Grave couldn’t believe their eyes. The Reversal Sword had been hiding under their feet the whole time!

No one would believe them unless they saw how it emerged. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Huang Xiaolong looked at the sword in his hand and lightly caressed the blade. The Reversal Sword was like an obedient child who hummed quietly.

“Heh, what a playful child.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

He saw the burning gaze in the eyes of those around him and a smile appeared on his face. “What’s the matter, you want to snatch it?”

Everyone could hear the mockery in his voice.

The Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu felt their expressions turning grim. That was a universe treasure they were talking about! Everyone would feel tempted to snatch it!

Moreover, it was also said that anyone who refined the Reversal Sword would be able to comprehend the strongest sword manual in existence!

To put things into perspective, Jian Wushuang’s Unparalleled Sword Manual would be worthless beside it!

Huang Xiaolong saw the looks of hesitation on their faces and chuckled, “If no one wishes to fight me for it, I’ll be heading to the Enlightenment Mountain.”

Jiang Dacheng also managed to find his sword when the Reversal Sword emerged earlier.

The Nether Yang King could no longer resist the temptation and he took a step out. Sucking in a cold breath, he said, “I will challenge you.”

Even though Huang Xiaolong defeated Bing Yu when they fought over the Supreme Ghost King Ship, the Nether Yang King couldn’t control the greed in his heart when faced with the Reversal Sword. He felt that he stood a chance against Huang Xiaolong.

After all, Bing Yu only had 16 billion units of combat strength. He had exceeded the 18 billion mark!

With his current strength, he had the ability to fight most people in the Unknown Lands! Unless Gui Chi or Lord Green Ghost came personally, he would be able to retreat eventually!

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “You better think about it carefully. The moment you try anything, you’ll end up like Bing Yu.”

The Nether Yang King’s expression sank in response. “Do you really think you’ve won before we even started? You’re overestimating yourself!”

“Alright, make your move.” Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to talk to him anymore.

Raising the Scarlet Dragon Sword he just obtained, he summoned another ghost blade in his other hand.

The ghost blade was crescent shaped and it emitted a soft blue glow. The cries of countless devils caused goosebumps to appear on everyone’s bodies.

That was the Nether Yang Ghost Blade the Nether Yang King crafted after gathering countless types of precious resources in the Green Ghost Lands. It was a pseudo universe treasure, and it used the souls of countless starving ghosts as its weapon spirit. The blade would produce a sort of ghastly liquid and it was a type of supreme poison that could dissolve his opponent’s dao soul!

Even though he revealed his weapon, he didn’t take action immediately. He started to gather his strength and a black sun appeared behind him.

As soon as it appeared, it snapped up all the light in the world.

Turning the world around him into pure darkness, the experts standing around quickly retreated. Not even Wu Zun and Jiu Yu dared to remain. The black light that came from the reverse sun behind the Nether Yang King wasn’t something they dared to take on.

Everyone who knows about the Nether Yang King would know that he trained in the Nether Sun Manual! He lived in the Black Wind Hell, and he made it according to the principle of the darkness hurricanes there! The rays of darkness contained terrifying streaks of black wind!

The black wind could corrode the bodies of those it touched. It was formless, and it was extremely terrifying.

Huang Xiaolong remained in his spot and he didn’t bother raising his defenses with his grand cosmos energy. He simply tanked the black wind with his physical body!

The Nether Yang King sucked in a cold breath when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s reaction to his attack. He didn’t know why, but he felt like retreating all of a sudden.

When he wanted to try something else, a voice tore through the void. “Brother Nether Yang King grew stronger again!”

The sudden interruption caused everyone to stare in the direction of the voice.

A young man emerged from the darkness, and Bing Yu stood beside him!

The young man looked extremely handsome, but there was an air of evil around him.

“Yin Reversal Ghost King!” Someone in the crowd yelled and their expressions changed.

Yin Reversal Ghost King, the leader of the Ghost Kings in the Green Ghost Lands!

A smile broke out on the Nether Yang King’s face. “Brother Yin Reversal, you’re here! It’s been a long time since we last met.”

“Yes. It's been long. After we deal with this brat, we’ll have a good drink!” The Yin Reversal King muttered.

“Of course!” The Nether Yang King grinned in approval.

As the Yin Reversal King walked towards Huang Xiaolong, he caught sight of the Reversal Sword in his hand. His eyes lit up instantly. “Brother Nether Yang, let’s kill him now.”

“That’s exactly my intention.”

A chilly air surrounded the Yin Reversal King’s body and the temperature in the region seemed to dip by several degrees. Silver light emerged from his body and it seemed to be completely different from the black light from the Nether Yang King.

Even though their powers were completely different, it melded together perfectly!

Bing Yu glared at Huang Xiaolong in the distance and he sneered in contempt. Now that the Yin Reversal King and the Nether Yang King were working together, they would be able to make Gui Chi think twice when fighting them! He refused to believe that the kid was stronger than Lord Gui Chi!

Brat, you’re asking to die! How dare you fight with me for the Supreme Ghost King Ship?!

Huang Xiaolong muttered softly while looking at the two of them. “Since you’re ready, hurry up and make your move.”

The two ghost kings soared into the air and a ghost chain appeared in the Yin Reversal Ghost King’s hand. It shot towards Huang Xiaolong and wrapped around his neck instantly. The ghost chain was extremely sharp, and it decapitated many experts in the past before they could react.

The Ghost Blade in the Nether Yang King’s hand shot out at the same time and it formed a ray of black light that shot towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Wu Zun and the others couldn’t even see the two experts making their moves! They were too fast and all the others could see was a blur!

Of course, that only applied to experts other than Huang Xiaolong. In his eyes, their weapons came towards him in slow motion. He only waved his sword when the Ghost Chain and Ghost Blade arrived before him.
