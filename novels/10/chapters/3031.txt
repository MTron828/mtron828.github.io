Chapter 3032: Too Vicious

No one could contain their laughter when the expert from the Devil Blade Creed spoke.

“Hahaha glutton! That’s such an accurate description!” The expert from the Panhu Creed roared with laughter.

Huang Xiaolong remained expressionless, but Lei Yu’s face sank.

“Do you know how much trouble you can get into just by spewing bullsh*t? What you said might cause your creeds to be exterminated!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air. It contained unquestionable power and it rang loud and clear in the ears of everyone present.

In the past few days, Huang Xiaolong had learned about the situation in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave. He was able to recognize the two of them from the robes they wore.

Huang Xiaolong’s words caused everyone to stare at him in stunned silence.

Chen Huo, the expert from the Panhu Creed, radiated evil light from his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “What a dumb*ass. Do you really think you’re someone important? Do you believe if I tell you that I’ll twist your head off your shoulders right now?”

Yang Dingtian, the expert from the Devil Blade Creed, sneered, “If you crawl here on your knees and apologize before giving us a hundred million dao coins each, I’ll pretend to have not heard what you said. Otherwise, I’ll exterminate your Leiyu Creed!”

Chen Huo was a Sixth Creation Dao Venerable, and his position in the Panhu Creed wasn’t low. He was a hall master, and Yang Dingtian was a doyen from the Devil Blade Creed. He was an early-Seventh Creation Dao Venerable, placing him firmly in the high-level Dao Venerable Realm.

Everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu with a look of mockery.

“The two of them are too damn stupid! How dare they offend the Panhu Creed and the Devil Blade Creed by threatening them with extermination? Do they really think they’re the Golden Fox Dao Venerable or something?”

“The Leiyu Creed is in deep sh*t now!”

Everyone shook their heads silently.

Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them and turned to the Old Monster Flame standing behind him. “Shatter both their legs and hands before you pop their heads off their shoulders.”

Chen Huo and Yang Dingtian roared with laughter when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s order.

Those in the restaurant burst out laughing too.

However, two miserable shrieks rang through the Heaven Seizing Inn before anyone could react. When the spectators turned to look at Chen Huo and Yang Dingtian, they saw that their legs had already been cripple.

They kneeled on the floor with their legs mangled beyond belief, and everyone felt as though a bucket of cold water was thrown on them.

The Old Monster Flame stared at them coldy before raising their arms. A ray of light flashed before their eyes and their arms were severed from their bodies.

Cries filled the air once again, and they nearly fainted from the pain. A trace of yin soul energy was used by the Old Monster Flamewhen he made his move, and even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables wouldn’t be able to remain standing before his torture methods, much less these two weaklings.

Silence descended on the Heaven Seizing Inn, and everyone looked at Chen Huo and Yang Dingtian whose limbs had been severed.

A Sixth Esteem and Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable had their limbs severed in an instant!

Wouldn’t that mean that their heads were next?

They couldn’t help but recall Huang Xiaolong’s order. It didn’t seem so funny now that they were looking at the two limbless bodies.

“You’re dead! You’re definitely going to die for this!” Chen Huo roared in anger as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. Cosmos energy belonging to a Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable filled the air as the earth started to tremble.

Despite his ‘overwhelming’ strength, the Old Monster Flame merely pressed down slightly with his palm. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Pop!” Like a watermelon, Chen Huo’s head popped. The stench of blood filled the hall.

Yang Dingtian’s expression changed and the killing intent on his face disappeared. He tried to beg for mercy, but he was killed by the Old Monster Flame before he could do anything.

Looking at the two headless corpses in the hall, the experts sitting all around felt their legs going soft. There were even some who vomited out everything they ate.

Those enjoying a meal in the Heaven Seizing Inn were members who had seen their fair share of gory scenes throughout their lives. However, they witnessed two monsters at the Sixth and Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm die by the hands of someone else! One of them was a hall master of the Panhu Creed, and the other was a doyen in the Devil Blade Creed! They were figures who could cause the region to shake with a stomp of their feet!

However…

The Old Monster Flame grabbed the dao souls of the fleeing duo and brought them to Huang Xiaolong.

Turning to Lei Yu, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Deal with them.”

Revealing his pearly white teeth in a very sinister smile, Lei Yu chuckled heartily. “My pleasure!” He threw them into a random cosmos artifact as soon as he spoke as he used the power of lightning and fire to torture their dao souls.

Those sitting around the restaurant wouldn’t forget Lei Yu’s smile for as long as they lived.

Huang Xiaolong turned to the other members of the two creeds and spoke with a placid voice, “Go back and inform your patriarchs of everything that happened today. By the time the auction ends, I wish to see them standing before me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind taking a trip down to your creed after I leave Xuan City.”

The members of the Panhu Creed and Devil Blade Creed didn’t dare to say anything, else and they bolted through the entrance as soon as the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. They were afraid he could change his mind and kill them if they remained.

Looking at the disgusting scene of blood and flesh on the ground, Huang Xiaolong lost his appetite. He called for the attendant and settled the bill before bringing Lei Yu and the others out of the restaurant.

Even after a long time after they left, the Heaven Seizing Inn remained completely silent. No one could comprehend what just happened.

“This… This… He’s too vicious!” Someone finally broke the silence. “He dared to break the limbs of Chen Huo and Yang Dingtian before smashing their heads!”

“Chen Huo is the hall master of the Panhu Creed, and Yang Dingtian is a eminent elder of the Devil Blade Creed. The two creeds will never let the matter rest! Leiyu Creed is screwed!” Someone sneered.

“That might not be the case. If the two of them dared to kill Chen Huo and Yang Dingtian in public, they might have the abilities to back it up.”

“They might not be from our Golden Fox Heavenly Cave… After all, no one has ever heard of them!”

When they were discussing the fates of Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu, the members of the Devil Curse Creed were celebrating amongst themselves.

“Who would have thought that the two of them would be carrying so much money with them?!” Xue Fei nearly jumped in joy.

“Senior Brother Xue Fei, the dao coins might not be theirs. It might belong to Zhou Kang, and now that we robbed them…” a disciple asked cautiously.

A sneer formed on Xue Fei’s face and he joked, “It’s just the Leiyu Creed. Why should we be afraid of them? Moreover, our Devil Curse Creed is going to form an alliance with the Nine Vision Creed to exterminate the Leiyu Creed soon! When the dust settles, all that’s left is to split up their inheritance!”

The disciples standing around him were shocked.

“Exterminating the Leiyu Creed? What about the Golden Fox Dao Venerable?” someone asked.

“Relax. Our creeds gave him a genesis level pill each and the Golden Fox Dao Venerable said that he would let it slide.” A look of glee formed on Xue Fei’s face. “Let’s go. Since we’re here, let’s go to the Heaven Seizing Inn and enjoy ourselves!”
